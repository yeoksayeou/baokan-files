### Yu Youren Discusses Impressions of His Trip to the West

Lanzhou: President Yu went to Qinghai today for inspection. A reporter visited President Yu upon his return from Hexi to inquire about his impressions of his trip to the west. He said that over the past four or five years, various aspects of Hexi have been improving daily through the adjustments made by the authorities and the hard work of local party and government personnel. The general public's efforts in complying with laws and regulations and assisting in road construction demonstrate their efforts in resisting the Japanese and building the nation, which is commendable. What he found most gratifying was the gradual development of local education, with teachers and students showing excellent spirit and full of new vitality. However, due to the vastness of the area, universal education is still needed. In addition, he discussed the abundance of surface and underground resources in Hexi. Just considering the fruits produced along the two thousand-mile route, the development of transportation in the future will be a major source of revenue for Hexi. When discussing the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang, President Yu happily stated that this is "the ocean of art for various Eastern ethnic groups and a national treasure of our country." However, due to inadequate preservation, there is a risk of it being submerged. He said that he has decided to establish the Dunhuang Art Academy and appoint the famous painter Zhang Daqian, who is currently surveying the caves, to preside over it in order to preserve this precious legacy of the ancients.

### Overview of Savings Activities in Counties Along the Longhai Railway Line

Chongqing: The National Savings Promotion Association attaches great importance to the effectiveness of the savings movement in reaching the general public. It has instructed provincial branches to send personnel to various counties to supervise the work of the branch associations. According to recent reports from along the Longhai Railway line, primary school teachers in many counties are utilizing gatherings to explain the benefits of saving to the public, which has been effective but still needs to be strengthened. The savings amount averages between 100,000 and 200,000 yuan per county, mostly in small amounts. Later, enthusiastic compatriots from the area also participated in savings. In a location near the front lines, the commander of the self-defense forces purchased 10,000 yuan in bonds, taking the lead in promoting savings, and the response was very enthusiastic. The Special Party Headquarters of the Xth War Zone launched a savings campaign for soldiers, coordinating with local post offices and military post offices to implement savings, which was particularly arduous. Despite the irregular geography along the Longhai Railway, it has gradually taken shape shortly after its establishment, which is commendable. The Association is currently compiling reports from various sources to conduct further research, with the aim of promoting even faster development. (Dispatch of the 25th)

United Press, New Delhi, 25th: Carroll, the London bureau manager of the United Press, recently traveled to Moscow with British and American missions. He will fly to Chongqing from Moscow as soon as he obtains an exit permit.

### The USS Kearny Greatly Damaged

Protest Over the Robin Moor Case; Germany Has Not Yet Replied to the United States

Reuters, Washington, 25th: President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the US destroyer USS Kearny was recently struck by a torpedo and greatly damaged. The details that have been received are mostly technical in nature, and it is not convenient to discuss them at this time.

Havas, Washington, 24th: Secretary of State Hull recently told the press that the US government has protested to Germany over the sinking of the US ship "Robin Moor" by a German submarine in August of this year, but has not yet received a reply from the German government.

Reuters, Washington, 25th: President Roosevelt yesterday responded to a reporter's question about the German bombing of a large number of ships in the Red Sea by jokingly saying that what he had heard about the Red Sea situation was that Hitler told an important Jew who was still residing in Germany that if he could perform the miracle of how Moses parted the sea so that the children of Israel could safely cross the Red Sea, he would be allowed to stay in Germany.

Havas, San Francisco, 24th: Rear Admiral Land, Chairman of the Maritime Commission, recently gave a speech stating that the output of the US shipbuilding industry will soon exceed the tonnage of merchant ships sunk by the Axis powers.

### Japanese Industry and Commerce Gradually Losing Normalcy

Reuters, Washington, 25th: The Department of Commerce's Foreign Commerce Weekly reports that Japanese trade with major overseas countries has been suspended, and there is a great shortage of raw materials. Industry and commerce are gradually losing normalcy. Ships between Japan and the United States, the British Empire, and the Dutch East Indies have almost all been suspended. These locations account for 75% of Japan's foreign trade, and have traditionally supplied Japan with steel, lead, zinc, aluminum, copper, tin, cotton, gasoline, machinery, and other goods. Now, Japan can only rely on the Japanese-held group region. However, it is almost impossible for Japan to achieve self-sufficiency in raw materials in this region in the short term. Therefore, Japan is now making every effort to conserve raw materials. All hardware items, even broken spades, boilers, sewer covers, etc., are being collected as much as possible. It goes without saying that gasoline retailers are closing down one after another, and there is a growing shortage of food for the people. The future of the Japanese silk industry is very uncertain, and the import and export of cotton goods have almost ceased. Raw cotton from South America is difficult to transport due to limited shipping, and the amount of cotton produced in the occupied areas of China is not as high as expected.

### Japan Will Not Abandon Expansion Plans; Although a Far East Conflict is Avoidable

US Naval Chief Declares the Current Situation Extremely Tense; Assisting Britain and the Soviet Union is the Most Important Task at Present

Reuters, Washington, 25th: US Navy Secretary Knox stated yesterday to several naval munitions manufacturers that if Japan does not abandon its expansion plans, a Far East conflict is inevitable. The situation in the Far East is currently extremely tense. We know that the Japanese have no intention of abandoning their expansion plans. If they continue down this path, conflict is unavoidable. Knox made these remarks while discussing how to transport munitions to assist the Soviet Union. Knox had rushed back from another meeting. He did not say with whom he was meeting, but said that everyone present agreed that supplying Britain and the Soviet Union with war materials was extremely important. Knox urged the munitions manufacturers not to miss any opportunity to produce quickly, and said that maintaining the Soviet army in the war is one of the most important events we should do in this decisive battle. There are three ways to transport supplies into the Soviet Union: Arkhangelsk, Vladivostok, and around Africa and into Persia. Of these three routes, Arkhangelsk is the best, but it is located in the far north and has many difficulties. Icebreakers must be used to keep the port open. Ships traveling on this route cannot be expected to be fast, and are vulnerable to German bomber attacks. Furthermore, Arkhangelsk does not have sufficient transportation facilities. At the same time, the situation in the Far East makes the continued use of the Vladivostok route a problem. This route is just as undesirable as Arkhangelsk. The third route requires a 12,000-mile voyage, and inland transportation will also be very difficult, such as building railways through Persia, etc.

Havas, Washington, 24th: Colonel Knox, the Navy Secretary, convened several dozen ammunition manufacturers and shipping industry representatives today to discuss the issue of the United States supplying the Soviet Union with arms. He also gave a speech during the meeting.

Reuters, Washington, 25th: The Sea and Land Army Weekly published an article written by Navy Secretary Knox on the Navy Memorial Day, stating, "The East is like a large powder keg that can explode at any time. The sound of its explosion will be heard overseas. Democratic countries are now praying that the Soviet Union can maintain its military strength. The Axis armies not only threaten East Africa and the African coast across the Atlantic from the Americas, but India and Singapore will also be the next targets of the Axis powers. US warships are now patrolling the US seas and are instructed to sink Axis ships upon sight."

United Press, Washington, 25th: Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, wrote in the current issue of Sea and Land Army Weekly, "The Navy should prepare to deal with any current power or combined powers, regardless of whether the threat comes from the Pacific or the Atlantic."

Reuters, London, 25th: The local newspapers unanimously commented on the statement by US Navy Secretary Knox that a conflict is possible in the Far East, saying that it can be seen as an indication that the US government is ending its policy of appeasement.

Reuters, Washington, 25th: Senator Pepper told reporters today that the United States should immediately blockade Japan to cut off the supply of all military supplies to Japan. He agreed with Navy Secretary Knox's statement that the situation in the Pacific is extremely tense, and said that we should take action before Japan launches a pincer attack on the Soviet Union.

United Press, Santiago, Chile, 25th: "La Prensa" yesterday advised the Chilean government to take necessary measures as the US-Japanese Pacific war approaches. The newspaper outlined the political, military, and economic crisis of such a war, stating that the crises that will inevitably be encountered are the occupation of Easter Island and the various Chilean overseas islands. It also said that the recently annexed Antarctic territories will be suitable for supplying raiding ships and submarines. In addition, Japan will be able to cut off Chile's supply to the United States.

Japan Issues Official Announcement Expressing Dissatisfaction with US Naval Chief's Speech

United Press, Tokyo, 25th: The Cabinet Information Bureau issued an official brief announcement today, saying that US Navy Secretary Knox's speech yesterday was unfortunate because US-Japanese negotiations are underway, and Knox's speech is far from the spirit of these negotiations. Japanese observers said that the meaning of Knox's speech to munitions manufacturers is not surprising in light of his past views, and that it is clearly intended to stir up war sentiment at home when the situation in Europe is unfavorable to Britain, rather than to intimidate Japan. They said that Knox's pro-war remarks seem strange because recent news from Washington said that the government has banned non-diplomatic officials from making hostile remarks against Japan. Japanese evening newspapers all prominently published Knox's speech, with headlines mostly accusing him of insulting Japan.

United Press, Tokyo, 25th: The Japan Times and Mail, known as the mouthpiece of the Foreign Ministry, argued strongly today that the United States should try to be friendly with Japan and not cause Japan to join the Axis powers to strengthen the already powerful striking force of the Axis. If the United States believes that Nazi Germany is its enemy, then why must the United States force Japan to join the war to aid the enemies of the United States? The United States should make all reasonable concessions to keep Japan neutral in order to assist Britain and the Soviet Union. If the United States continues to aid Chongqing, there is also a risk of forcing Japan to join the war, and this move will only make it necessary to greatly increase the production of American military equipment. If the United States stops material assistance to China, it can save a lot of military supplies that will need to be used to deal with Japan. Japan has sufficient naval and military forces to exclude the Allied trade from the Pacific and even the Indian Ocean. This factor is very important in the balance of power in the wartime world. According to the newspaper, the British government should have made some adjustments with Japan months ago. The solution should be decided by Britain. Britain has made all the wars and suffered all the losses on behalf of the United States, and should know better than Washington what it means to add an enemy.

### Tokyo Officials Claim Yesterday: Nomura Temporarily Will Not Return to Japan; Wakasugi and Welles Continue Talks

United Press, Washington, 25th: Wakasugi, the Japanese Minister to the US and advisor to Ambassador Nomura, met with Under Secretary of State Welles yesterday, apparently continuing the exploratory talks between the US and Japan. Afterwards, Wakasugi declined to comment on whether the Japanese Embassy had received new instructions from Tokyo. It has now been learned that, unless the situation in the Pacific becomes too tense to leave his post, Nomura will return to Tokyo soon to confer with Tojo's new cabinet. If Nomura cannot be spared, Counselor Iguchi of the embassy may go to Tokyo instead. Kojima, Nomura's special advisor, will depart for Japan tomorrow. It is widely known that Nomura is deeply aware of American public opinion regarding Japan and its future actions in the Far East, and clearly believes that if the United States goes to war with Japan, it will undoubtedly have the support of the people. American public opinion also believes that the United States will win without much effort. It is believed that Nomura wants to inform his government of this view, as he believes that all issues between the two countries can be resolved through diplomacy. What he fears is that the question of Japan's circumstances may render diplomacy ineffective.

Reuters, Tokyo, 20th: According to a special dispatch from the Nichi-Nichi Shimbun in Washington, Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura may personally return to his country to report to Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Togo, or send an embassy counselor back to report. Officials here say that this news is speculative rumor and is unlikely to materialize at present.

Reuters, Tokyo, 25th: Last night, a semi-official Japanese source stated that reports of American sentiment gradually advocating inviting Japanese representatives to Washington to adjust relations between the two countries have aroused great interest. There is no inherent animosity between Japan and the United States. The Japanese government and the current government have stated their peaceful intentions, as far as possible to achieve their goals in East Asia. Therefore, the result of the US-Japan talks depends entirely on the sincerity of the United States. By "sincerity" is meant a correct understanding of the limits of Japan in the US-Japan talks. The United States should now seize the current opportunity and adopt the views expressed by the new Japanese Foreign Minister.

Havas, Washington, 24th: Government leaders are pessimistic about the current US-Japan negotiations. In recent days, government authorities have repeatedly warned political commentators who believe that the United States will adopt a policy of appeasement in the Pacific not to jump to conclusions.

American Sentiment Opposes Any Appeasement Actions

Reuters, Washington, 25th: The announcement issued by the Maritime Commission, stating that materials being shipped to the Soviet Union would depart from Boston, was obviously drafted hastily and without consideration. In fact, this statement should be interpreted as meaning that all goods passing through the Atlantic Ocean will depart from Boston, not that all aid to the Soviet Union will depart from this route. The facts may be stated plainly and simply: aid to the Soviet Union will still pass through Vladivostok, but goods departing from the American East Coast will be shipped to Archangel. This is because goods produced in the American states must be transported by rail over a long distance to San Francisco, and then transported by rail for five thousand miles from Vladivostok to the Soviet front. Therefore, it is easier to transport goods produced in the eastern states to Archangel. After reaching Archangel, it is only a few hundred miles to the Soviet positions. It is reported that Moscow has requested that some supplies be shipped in via Archangel. A critic here, Mr. Krabb, stated that the State Department and the President's Office were greatly surprised by this announcement from the Maritime Commission, and the New York Times even quoted Crocker as saying that not only were the British and Soviet embassies shocked by this announcement, but the Maritime Commission itself felt uneasy about the announcement as reported in the newspapers. Tokyo was delighted by this appeasement action by the United States, but this self-congratulation is premature, as the United States has no intention of appeasing Japan in this plan. It is said that because the Unified Committee released this news, it directly supplied useful information to the German Navy, so there is much criticism of the committee. The Washington Post published an editorial stating that American public opinion firmly opposes any action containing a hint of appeasement toward Japan, or any concession under Japanese threat. The significance of this announcement by the Maritime Commission is that the US authorities believe that Moscow will not fall into German hands in the short term, so some supplies are being shipped to the Soviet front lines via Archangel.

Japanese Political Commentators Advocate Convening an Axis Conference

United Press, Tokyo, 25th: Shimizu, a political commentator for the Hochi Shimbun, called in the morning newspaper for the Japanese government to find a way to hold a conference with Germany and Italy. He said that this conference is more important than the Japanese-American negotiations. Japanese diplomacy is based on the Tripartite Pact and cannot allow the Japanese-American negotiations to violate the spirit of the Tripartite Pact. He also said that if Japan does not know whether Germany wants to completely defeat the Soviet Union, or intends to cease fire soon and retain the conquered territory, then Japan cannot decide its policy toward the Soviet Union.

### Petain Volunteers as Hostage to Prevent German Massacre of Innocents

French Leaders Discuss Curbing Assassinations; Parisian Public Outraged by Execution of Hostages

Havas, Vichy, 24th: It is widely rumored that Marshal Petain plans to go to the occupied zone in person to act as a "hostage" in order to prevent the German military authorities from massacring hostages indiscriminately. However, when asked of people close to Marshal Petain, they all refused to make any statement.

Havas, Vichy, 25th: Internal Affairs Minister Pucheu attended a cabinet meeting today. After hearing that the German authorities had postponed the execution of one hundred French hostages, he set off for Paris. At the same time, the mayor of Bordeaux asked the residents of the city to cooperate with the authorities in apprehending the murderer in the assassination of a German officer.

Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 25th: According to what was announced here yesterday, the issues discussed by Petain and Interior Minister Pucheu were the attacks by French people on German soldiers in Nantes and Bordeaux. Political circles here believe that the government will take strict measures to curb such illegal activities.

Reuters, London, 25th: According to news from the French border, the Parisian public is deeply angered by the execution of hostages. Lists of those executed, which were recently posted in prominent locations in Paris, have been torn down, so the reposted lists are now guarded by police to prevent them from being torn down again. On October 17th, eight members of the French Academy were arrested, and about 300 university professors and other educators were also detained for refusing to sign a declaration supporting the new order. The arrest of these people has made a great impression on the French people. At the same time, all Jews in France continue to be arrested, regardless of their nationality. There are now almost no Jewish residents in Paris. It is reported that the Spanish representative is quite displeased that Spanish Jews are also among those arrested, and has reportedly stated that Spain has no racial issues.

### British and French Allied Forces Occupy Dassennato

Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 25th: According to a report from the Governor of Djibouti, two detachments of soldiers, about three hundred men, one from the Toggol army and the other from the British army, have now occupied Dassennato in French Somaliland. Dassennato is located between the Gulf of Aden and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, thirty kilometers northwest of the port of Dikhil.

### British Destroyer Sunk by Mine

Reuters, London, 25th: The British Admiralty announced that the British destroyer HMS Broadwater was sunk by a torpedo while on escort duty in the North Atlantic. The crew's relatives have been notified. The HMS Broadwater had shelled an enemy submarine the day before it was sunk, possibly sinking it. This is the second of the fifty destroyers transferred by the United States to Britain to be sunk. Among the officers killed on board was Major Parker of Boston, USA, who belonged to the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve. It is believed that Parker is the first American to die while serving in the British Navy. The first destroyer transferred by the United States to Britain to be sunk was the HMS Bath, manned by the Norwegian Navy.

Staying Two Weeks, Then Going to New Zealand; US and Australia to Exchange Air Force Officers

Reuters, Sydney, 25th: Australian Foreign Minister Evatt announced that Duff Cooper will arrive in Australia on November 5th and stay for two weeks, visiting Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, and other places before going to New Zealand. It is expected that Duff Cooper will discuss with the Australian government the measures to be taken to defend the Pacific, and may be invited to attend meetings of the War Cabinet and the War Advisory Council. It is said that the situation in the Far East is still critical, and the visits of Duff Cooper and Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East Brooke-Popham to Australia are timely, as the Australian government can obtain valuable and reliable information on current developments.

United Press, Melbourne, 25th: The Cabinet announced yesterday that it will send a senior officer from the Royal Australian Air Force to Washington as the first exchange of air force personnel between Australia and the United States.

Editorial

### On US-Japan Relations Again

After the decision to change the shipping route of a portion of American aid to the Soviet Union, Japan became complacent, insisting that this was an American concession to Japan and boasting of a diplomatic victory. However, according to an explanation from Washington yesterday, this was fundamentally just a technical measure to adapt to needs, because shipping to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok takes ten days, while taking the route via Archangel only takes forty-eight hours. At a time when the Red Army is waiting urgently for supplies, the United States, disregarding the threat of destruction that Germany could launch in the Arctic Ocean, resolutely decided to take a more difficult but actually shorter route. This seems to be enough to show the United States' active and courageous support for the Soviet Union. How can it be misinterpreted as appeasement of Japan? The only thing that can be criticized is that even if the Maritime Commission had such a decision, it was not necessary to publicly announce it, which was criticized as "supplying useful information to German raiders." No wonder that after this announcement was made, the State Department, the White House, and the British and Soviet embassies all felt surprised.

Frankly speaking, the main significance of Tojo's cabinet is only to create a situation that is convenient for action at any time. In the past, only because Japan's national strength had been consumed by more than half due to the war against China, and because the anti-aggression front in the Far East was already quite strong, it did not dare to rashly engage in actions that were too large-scale or too risky without a "suitable opportunity." If this opportunity suddenly appears, then it is believed that even if the United States appeases, it is feared that it will not be able to restrain Japan. "Small favors" like changing the route of aid to the Soviet Union, especially, cannot be said to be able to stop Japan. Moreover, to take a step back, even if we assume that this decision by the US Maritime Commission is not unrelated to the ongoing US-Japan talks, the fact is that these talks show no signs of completion. Therefore, even if the US government intends to appease Japan, there is no need to meet the Japanese demands ahead of time before the talks are over, because if our memory is correct, it seems that the basic principle of this US-Japan talk is to exchange economic concessions for Japan's abandonment of aggression. Now, Japan has not only not provided any guarantees, but has instead emerged with a more radical cabinet than before. Under these circumstances, the United States has even less reason to be two-faced and devalue itself.

Some say that the United States, firstly, seeing that the Soviet front-line battles are quite serious, and secondly, that the Nazi threat in the Atlantic is becoming increasingly imminent, has no choice but to temporarily appease Japan to avoid the danger of fighting on two fronts. This statement seems reasonable on the surface, but if we analyze it further, it is still a specious argument. First, it is true that the situation in Moscow has been very critical in the past few days, but seeing that the Red Army's resistance is still strong, and that the relocation of the capital and the gathering of reinforcements are still in good order, it is believable that even if Moscow falls, Stalin will not abandon the war and make peace, as France did. In addition, winter is approaching in a blink of an eye, and even if the Nazis capture the Red Capital, their future offensive, in the icy and snowy environment, will probably require a considerable period of replenishment and preparation, and it will be difficult to continue their efforts. Second, although the threat in the Atlantic is great, Britain's strength is strong and complete, and it can certainly still be used. The reason why it has always been unwilling to rashly open a second battlefield in Western Europe is believed to be its fundamental intention, which is to focus on this. Therefore, as far as the United States is concerned, the current problem is only how to arm merchant ships, how to implement escorts, and how to fully supply Britain and the Soviet Union with all necessary military and material resources, so that on the one hand, the Red Army can continue to resist, and on the other hand, Britain can be prepared to meet the Nazi onslaught with a strong and effective posture in case of a westward turn. Therefore, before Britain shows signs of collapse, the United States cannot fundamentally talk about joining the European war. Although the repeated attacks on American ships by German submarines are undoubtedly intended to provoke the United States and force it to declare war early, so as to give Japan an opportunity to act, it can be seen from the consistent prudence of the Washington government that it has long seen through its tricks and will not act rashly and fall into the Nazi plot to induce the United States to fight on two fronts. From this point of view, as long as Britain and the Soviet Union are strong enough to hold back the Axis powers, even if the United States' preparations for joining the European war are completed, and even if the opportunity to join the war is ripe, it is still better to join as late as possible. The reason is that before the United States joins the European war, it must first eliminate its worries in the Pacific, which will not be achieved by a policy of appeasement, because temporary appeasement is tantamount to giving the other party an opportunity to attack. This common sense, it is believed that President Roosevelt, who has always had the deepest understanding of the aggression front, will be able to understand thoroughly.

In summary, we dare to assert that the United States has no intention of appeasing Japan, because not only is there no such need, but it also clearly knows that it is useless. If we extend this further, we might as well assert that the United States will not participate in the European war, but if it does participate, it will first eliminate the hidden dangers in the Far East, and it will not eliminate them by means of appeasement, because such appeasement is tantamount to digging its own grave, which is not something a country preparing to go to war would be happy to do. Before this situation occurs, it can only indirectly rely on the strength of others to consume the strength that constitutes this hidden danger. In other words, it can only assist China in attacking Japan, just as it assists Britain and the Soviet Union in attacking Germany. Regarding this, the remarks made by US Navy Secretary Knox the day before yesterday that "a US-Japan conflict is ultimately inevitable" seem to be a powerful proof.

### De Zeng Deploys Reinforcements, Determined to Seize Soviet Capital in Decisive Battle

Soviet Side Reaffirms Determination to Fight a Protracted War, German Side Announces Capture of Kharkov City

Reuters, London, 25th Dispatch - Moscow Radio reports, according to the latest war report received by the "Pravda" at 3:00 AM this morning, that the Germans are now preparing for a decisive battle to seize Moscow. Fierce fighting took place on the front lines all day yesterday, but there were essentially no changes. German troops appear to be increasing reinforcements. At dawn yesterday, artillery fire began to roar. German tanks and infantry launched continuous attacks throughout the day without respite. South of Maloyaroslavets, German forces forced the Soviets to retreat at two points, but their continued advance was halted, and attempts to cross the Oka River also failed. Soviet forces in the northern sector of the Moscow front are still holding their original positions. The fighting west of Moscow near Mozhaisk is particularly fierce, with German forces attempting to develop offensives in both the northeast directions. Soviet forces are making every effort to defend every village. Soviet air force is now bombing the highways used by German reinforcements. In one area, they destroyed 70 German tanks and armored vehicles, 200 trucks, two infantry regiments, and two anti-aircraft artillery teams. The report concludes by stating that the German offensive on Moscow has now lasted 23 days, which shows that Hitler's plan to seize the city with a blitzkrieg has failed.

Haitong News Agency, 25th, German Headquarters Dispatch - Today's German military report states that German forces captured Kharkov yesterday, an important center of Soviet military industry and industry. Yesterday, Belgorod, a key transportation hub 75 kilometers west of Kharkov, was also captured.

International News Agency, 25th, Kuibyshev Dispatch - Soviet official spokesman Lozovsky announced here at the temporary Soviet capital yesterday for the first time to news reporters that the Soviets will fight for several years and that a new Second Red Army is being formed. "How long the German forces can maintain is still uncertain. They will soon be convinced that the Soviet reserves have not been exhausted." Marshal Timoshenko has been relieved of his command of the Central Front and has now succeeded Marshal Budyonny as commander of the Southern Front. (London sources speculate that Marshal Budyonny may have been ordered to command another independent Red Army, so that he can jointly defend the Caucasus with the British forces when the German forces break through the Southern Front.) The Red Star newspaper stated that the situation on the Southern Front is critical everywhere, "The enemy is trying to advance in order to occupy the most fertile areas of the Soviet Union."

Havas News Agency, 24th, Moscow Dispatch - The Moscow Garrison Command broadcast a message this morning stating that the vanguard of the German forces has reached a certain stronghold, only 14 miles away from Moscow.

Reuters, 25th, London Dispatch - The latest Soviet communique announced that it had stopped the German advance southwest of Moscow, but the situation on the Southern Front remains serious. The weather conditions on the front lines are currently hindering military operations. A Berlin spokesman stated that German forces are currently struggling through mud. The German military also expects that decisive battles cannot be engaged in until the ground freezes solid. A German official news agency quoted military commentators as saying that victories unrelated to the overall situation do not require constant reports. German forces have won ten major battles, which can bring the current war to an end, and victory will ultimately belong to Germany. At the same time, German front-line correspondents sent dispatches lamenting the difficult situation, stating that German forces are 100 miles away from Moscow, with Soviet troops gathered in between, and there are also battles on both sides of the road where German forces are advancing. Soviet artillery and aircraft are further increasing the difficulties for German forces. Moscow sources reported that the German side has deployed more fresh troops, including Finnish troops transferred to the Leningrad front and Romanian troops transferred to the southern front to assist in the battle. Several German regiments have suffered losses of six or seven tenths. The Soviet Red Star newspaper stated that the situation on the Southern Front remains serious, and the enemy forces are trying to occupy the most important industrial center, so they have stepped up their attacks on Rostov-on-Don, and the positions near the cities of Stalino and Makeevka in the Don River basin have repeatedly changed hands. Berlin claimed that one Soviet force had retreated behind the Donets River. At the same time, there are also fierce battles in Crimea. Moscow said that the enemy forces in Perekop have invaded the Soviet defense line, forming a wedge. The German side also reported that Soviet forces are currently attacking across the Neva River near Leningrad. The latest Soviet communique stated, "On October 24, our forces engaged the enemy in the Taganrog and Makeevka areas. In the Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets areas, the German fascist forces fiercely attacked our positions, suffering heavy blows and retreating. The enemy forces suffered heavy losses. On October 23, 10 German aircraft were destroyed, and the Soviet forces also lost 6 aircraft. On October 24, 17 enemy aircraft were shot down near Moscow." The Moscow Air Defense Command announced that the German side has lost 305 aircraft in air battles near Moscow, of which 100 were shot down in the past few days.

Germany Launches Offensive in the Northern Sector, Encounters Fierce Soviet Resistance, No Progress Made

Reuters, 25th, Moscow Dispatch - The Red Star newspaper dispatch stated that the war situation in the Donets Basin on the southern front remains serious. The enemy forces' plan to occupy the extremely important industrial center by a pincer attack has failed. After a short period of silence, the German forces resumed their attacks but were still repelled. However, in one area, the Soviet forces withdrew to new positions. The German forces in that area suffered heavy losses and have been forced to adopt a defensive posture. A Pravda war dispatch describing the activities on the northern front stated that after the German forces invaded the Kalinin region, they attempted to launch an offensive in the northwest, especially near Lake Ilmen. Fierce fighting has occurred in the past few days, but the enemy forces have now been driven back to their original positions, suffering considerable losses. In this battle, one German battalion, formed into a column one kilometer long, was heavily bombarded by strong Soviet artillery fire and mostly annihilated. In another area, after paying a heavy price, the enemy forces made a wedge-shaped breakthrough into the Soviet positions. The Soviet forces quickly launched a series of fierce counterattacks, and the German forces were unable to withstand it and fled in disarray, and the houses in the village of Kolmi, which they had occupied, were burned down by fire. The German forces in Novgorod, which had been inactive for a long time, recently attempted to cross the Pola River under the cover of morning fog, but were repelled by the Soviet forces' fierce artillery fire. In the three days of fierce fighting in the Lake Ilmen area, it is estimated that the German forces suffered more than 2,000 casualties and were not only unable to gain an inch but were also forced to withdraw from the village of Beli. Regarding the war situation on the Moscow front, the Soviet official news agency reported that extremely fierce fighting is continuing. The German forces are paying a heavy price in casualties, making slight intrusions into the Soviet positions, especially around Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets. German forces are currently desperately trying to break through the Soviet defenses. In one area, German forces have also deployed Romanian and Finnish troops to assist in the battle. At a certain point that was previously broken through by the German forces, the Soviet forces have launched a counterattack and recaptured it. On the night of the 22nd, the enemy forces launched another attack, and Soviet artillery fire prevented the advance of the German infantry and tanks. The road leading to the Soviet fortifications was covered with German corpses.

TASS News Agency, 25th, Central Front Battlefield Report Dispatch - Today, the enemy's offensive at all points on the central front was repelled. The Red Army led by Rokossovsky achieved particularly outstanding results. On the 24th alone, the team destroyed 80 enemy tanks and 200 military vehicles, while also annihilating two enemy infantry battalions. Fierce fighting is still continuing.

Landmine Explosion in Odessa City, Two Romanian Generals Killed

Reuters, 25th, Vichy Dispatch - A dispatch from Bucharest states that Odessa was bombed, and the Romanian commander of the fortress occupying the city, General Glugojanu, and 50 officers and soldiers were killed in the bombing. In addition, a certain building recently occupied by the Soviet secret police was occupied by the Romanian forces. When they turned the faucet to get water, they triggered a detonating cord, causing a huge bomb to explode, killing many Romanian soldiers. Lieutenant General Avirell, who was appointed as an administrative official in the city to carry out relief work, also died unexpectedly.

European War Miscellany

### The Depression of the French People

The main purpose of my article is not to explain why France collapsed, or to blame anyone, any group, or any system of thought. This matter has already been done by people more qualified than me. I have no ambition to add my personal opinions to the views of those who were in France at the time and personally experienced the unprecedented changes of May and June 1940.

Moreover, although I am a Frenchman, I was still abroad, in the United States, when this change occurred. My views are inevitably influenced by my environment.

But I can't help but think. In fact, like many of my comrades, for months, I have wanted to reach some kind of conclusion and, with extreme caution, seek to solve the problems caused by the failure of France, not only the problems for the French people, but also the problems caused for those who do not want to give up free judgment like the Americans. Of course, I know that I am in the United States and have the freedom of thought, speech, and writing, and I have gained great benefits. But I also know that no matter what my thoughts are, according to my current comrades in France, they are of no use, simply because I can enjoy the most proud freedom, while they have lost this freedom.

Therefore, the conclusion I have reached is of no other value than the personal opinion of someone who happened to be a Frenchman and whose father cannot know whether his thoughts and feelings are the same as those of someone living in a disintegrating France.

In my opinion, the basic factors of the current situation in France are as follows:

(1) The first mistake of the Bordeaux government in requesting an armistice was to assume that France had been defeated and that Britain could no longer support itself for more than a few weeks.

(2) One wrong move led to many irreparable difficulties, resulting in the Vichy government's baffling policies and unsolvable psychological conflicts. On the one hand, there was hope for Britain's victory and rebirth, but it was still considered too incredible. On the other hand, there was a belief that the defeated could only join hands with the victors to have a realistic faction that could save the situation.

(3) The public's hatred of the Germans is actually increasing.

(4) France's position has permanent fluidity. Although the French want to find their own solutions, in reality, this war has included the whole world and is expanding day by day. It is impossible to imagine the future during this period.

Regarding the first point, during the Bordeaux Conference, the French firmly believed that Britain would not be able to sustain itself for many weeks after the French army was defeated. Finally, it was decided that France should request an armistice from Germany. After a long debate, it was also decided that the government should remain in France. I have not heard any Frenchman disagree with this fact. The process of how to persuade President Lebrun to abandon the plan to go to the Philippines can be seen in the official report of the Vichy government. General Weygand seems to have first suggested an armistice after the failure of the resistance on the Somme River. Marshal Pétain and many others quickly echoed this suggestion.

The following fact is enough to prove that people generally believed that Britain could not resist the German attack alone.

When the French armistice delegation was discussing the terms of the armistice in Compiègne, the clause that France would no longer support Britain was also under discussion. One of the French delegates said, "In view of the fact that Britain will soon withdraw from the war, is this clause not superfluous?" General Keitel of Germany replied that he certainly hoped that what his French friend said was correct, but the German army could not take such chances.

If the French leaders at that time could have foreseen the success of British resistance, they could have taken many other routes. It is useless to speculate now. Poland's situation was far worse than France's, but it was still able to resist to the end. After the defeat of France, Britain's position was precarious. In the eyes of Nazi realists, it seemed almost hopeless, but Churchill, regardless of the failure of his allies, decided to continue the war. However, the French generals and most political leaders were convinced that the defeat of France was the end of the war. (To be continued)

### Gold Prices Rise for Eight Consecutive Days, Increase by More Than 8,300 Yuan, Newly Established Banks Only Know How to Collect Gold

Yesterday's black market prices saw an increase of 200 yuan for the October futures contract compared to the previous day. However, with only 40 taels traded that day, the price remained unchanged at 8,800 yuan. The cash market, on the other hand, was still in a state of turmoil, fluctuating outside the 18,000 yuan mark. Sales came from the Tianjin and Chaozhou syndicates and gold shops, while the newly established large and small speculative banks, each with a professional name in name only but essentially the same, absorbed huge amounts of capital, which they had no use for, and then used to absorb the remaining gold, colluding with large hoarders, competing to buy in. With this two-pronged approach, the gold market suddenly felt like a tiger with soaring momentum, and prices moved forward with a high head. It once rose from 17,100 yuan to 18,500 yuan, and soon turned to hover, but still closed up 950 yuan, with 4,500 taels traded in half a day.

Cash Market Rises 950

Yesterday, the spot price opened at 17,200 yuan, the same as the closing price of the previous day. When Chengji and the jewelry shop syndicate sold out, it retreated to 7,100 yuan. Hefeng and others suddenly came to pour in, and for a time the buying momentum was booming, and followers rose one after another, and the price soared by 1,000 yuan to 8,100 yuan. Chengji and others and the Tianjin syndicate saw the high and sold out, immediately reducing it by 400 yuan. The two banks came to enter again, and Xianghe and Defu fiercely raised the price, and the rising wind rose again, rising by another 800 yuan, reaching 18,500 yuan. Suddenly, Dafeng, who had poured in for a certain bank a few days ago, suddenly sold out more than 400 taels, and Chengji Tianyuan and others also sold out vigorously. When I saw it, it was retreating by 700 yuan, dropping to 7,000. Xianghe and Defu entered again, Dafeng suddenly entered 300 taels again, and Hefeng entered at a high price, raising it to 8,400 yuan. Chengji and others spat out, and at noon, it fell again. Shihe and others gave out 20 taels of Hengji. The noon close was 18,150 yuan, a further increase of 950 yuan. It has been rising for eight consecutive days, for a total increase of 8,360 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 1,400 yuan that day. After the closing, Xianghe entered another three or four hundred taels, raising it to 8,500 yuan. Defu vigorously sold 300 taels, and finally Dafeng gave out 50 taels at a price of 8,000 yuan. The market selling price of the gold number's own brand was 18,400 yuan, and the buying price was 6 or 700 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market in the afternoon, and there was no price outside the market.

Ornamental Gold Jumps Again by 100 Yuan

The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores, Datongxing and Xintongxing initially jumped up by 50 yuan, then rose by 40 yuan, and then rose by 30 yuan, for a total increase of 120 yuan, reaching 1,870 yuan. At noon, it fell back to 1,850 yuan, an increase of 100 yuan (buying price reduced by 100 yuan).

### Although the Exchange Rate is Flat, the Gold Pound Rises Again

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the Central Bank and HSBC both had flat listings. The HSBC small counter price was stagnant. The black market for British and American exchange rates was still stable. There were still many importers of non-essential goods seeking to settle, and there may have been small amounts of supply and sale positions at three yuan. The British exchange rate was still two pence and there was still no transaction, and it finally closed flat with the previous day's closing price. There was no market on Saturday afternoon.

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, British and American gold pounds rose sharply by 20 yuan along with the cash price. The British gold ticket was as stable as ever, and the market price stood flat. The American gold ticket rebounded to 34 yuan and 3 jiao, a rebound of 5 jiao from the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong tickets was strong, and the market price rose by 1 jiao. The Japanese gold ticket was slightly firmer, and the evening market was as high as 3 yuan and 4 jiao. The Korean ticket has started to pick up, and the evening market has retreated to 6 yuan and 7 jiao.

Tianjin, 25th (Saturday) Telegraph, this morning the exchange market opened flat, the London telegraphic transfer was tightly 3.125, was 2 pence 375, the New York telegraphic transfer was shrunk 375, was 3 yuan 875, the Shanghai exchange rate did not move, still stood at 84 yuan and a half, the "Joint Banknote" was cheapened by 8 jiao and 8 fen, was 40 yuan and 5 jiao.

Hong Kong, 15th (Saturday) Telegraph, this morning the exchange market opened unusually stable, and the exchange rates were still neither prosperous nor disgraced. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

### The Yarn Market Frequently Rises, Not Without Vigilance, The Situation is Gradually Losing its Former Stability

The yarn market situation is still fluctuating and unstable, the trend is slightly quieter, this is because of the continuous sharp rise, so that new buyers are all vigilant, and at the same time, the cash market situation, which has been running wildly every day, has also turned peaceful, some bulls have spat out, and the market has returned to looseness. The 20-count Double Horse factory order had already turned weak in the afternoon of the previous day, and yesterday the opening price was 2,410 yuan, and it immediately fell to the limit, but the sellers outside the market were not extinct, and gradually loosened to 2,385 yuan. Later, when I heard that the cash had rebounded, the people's hearts were lifted, and the meeting plate was raised to 2,440 yuan. The current yarn transaction is still rare, but many parties still come to pull up the price, and most of the current yarn in the hands of the industry is covered in the futures market, ready to untie the lock, and cannot be sold. As for the exchange's yarn cloth for this month, it is the last day, and the squeeze is fierce. I wonder if it can be loosened a little next Monday. Shenxin Maru Factory opened 1,550 bales of 20-count Double Horse on the previous day, and the price was 2,500 yuan, which was accepted by the industry.

The gold-transformed horse futures are stable and see fatigue, fatigue and then rise, the foothold seems to be still strong. The morning opening factory order first fell to the limit, and various gangs spread rumors, and for a time people's hearts were uneasy, and there were many scattered bulls coming out. The period yarn opened in the afternoon above had fallen to the limit, so it was not affected. The November opening was 2,350 yuan, once leaked to a low price of 2,275 yuan, and then returned to high. The December opening was 2,350 yuan, seeing an increase of 12 yuan. The January period opened at 2,400 yuan, and after entering, it rose and fell like a rabbit, and the trend was firm. The trend is that the rise and fall are too fast, and both parties cannot buy and sell calmly, so this kind of trend is difficult to trade under general monopoly. Although there are still blind ins and outs, it is also difficult to avoid escaping from the battlefield, and dare not hold it for a long time. If it is hit, its return wind will also be terrible, and those engaged in it must be more cautious. The list is after,

### The Cotton Ball Business is Also Lonely

The current cotton situation is slightly flat, and transactions are not prosperous, because its price is slightly loose, and manufacturers are also unwilling to do more, so the daily industry ball transactions are large, and yesterday, because of the relationship of Saturday, most people are watching, that is, the ball transactions also suddenly feel lonely.

Langong Flower 100 pieces 582.0 Haojia

Also 20 pieces 56.0 Haojia

Also 100 pieces 571.0 Haojia

Aomura 100 pieces 59.0 Haojia

### Chintz Gains and Losses See Each Other

The factory cloth opened once and fell, and then quickly rebounded, and the results were uniformly firm. The 16-pound Butterfly coarse cloth opened in the morning at 90 yuan, a decrease of 1 yuan and 2 jiao and a half compared to the previous day, and then turned around and rose to 93 yuan, and there was still a demand without supply, and it was estimated that it would increase by 1 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. The 10-pound Three Rabbit coarse cloth closed at noon at 70 yuan, and the afternoon opening was 70 yuan and 5 jiao, and the rest of the coarse and fine cloth twill rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan, with mutual differences, and the market transaction was slightly quiet, because it was a return after the fall, and people's hearts were not stable, and it was worth the risk of two nights, and it was estimated that the street transaction was more than 500 pieces, and the customer sales to the northern gang and eastern Zhejiang totaled more than 200 pieces.

The eastern cloth was first tired and then rose, and the situation was still high. The exchange's period cloth for this month continued to rise by 1 yuan, and the closing price was 79 yuan. The January period rose by 1 yuan and 7 jiao and 9 fen to the highest plate. The spot market transaction was very busy, and the cloths were uniformly firmly rising. The Longtou fine cloth factory order, the noon closing price, was 85 yuan and 2 jiao, a gain of 1 yuan and a half per piece. The Zhongdang miscellaneous brand fine cloth, because there are Japanese trading houses collecting, rebounded more quickly, and the color balls, Yanghe trumpets, etc. came out of the 80 yuan mark again, a gain of about 2 yuan and a half. The Four Gentlemen Serge 3 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen and a half, also increased by 1 jiao zero Li.

Because the cheongsam is popular with neiliaos, the cheongsam neiliao with stripes and plain colors of 20 yuan a yard from this factory sells more smoothly.

### Rice Prices Rise and Fall Back and Forth

The foreign rice, which has been soaring all the way, opened in the market yesterday, and the silver vault small dumplings were only 149 yuan, and the foreign vault was 148 yuan. The No. 1 Saigon high goods were also only 170 yuan, and the ordinary goods were 1678 yuan. Later, because the price was low, it caused large households to absorb again, and the ball tracked actively, and the market shape was still tight, and the silver vault small dumplings suddenly returned to 153 yuan, and the foreign vault was 152 yuan, and the No. 2 Saigon high goods recovered to 1712 yuan.

Although the daily flat powder is inevitable, it is said that the flat powder is only for the consumption of the small dumplings at a flat price, and the re-export still needs to be given to the commercial goods, so the buying atmosphere is suddenly strong, and Jinlong's spleen arrived in the afternoon at 44 yuan 56 jiao, and Yantai in the morning was 45 yuan 45 jiao, and the afternoon rose to 46 yuan, and also increased by 1 yuan and 35 jiao from the previous night, and the transaction was also more than 70,000 bags.

### American Economic Expert Kirkland Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong

Stabilizing Shanghai's Legal Tender as the Main Task, Practical Study of Foreign Exchange Management

According to reliable sources obtained yesterday, since the arrival of British and American economic experts Nie Mayer and Kirkland in China, they have held several meetings with Chinese officials in Hong Kong and Chongqing on China's wartime economic problems. It is said that important decisions have been made, one of which is to stabilize Shanghai's legal tender. However, before the new measures are implemented, the opinions of the financial communities in Hong Kong and Shanghai will be sought for consideration. Mr. Kirkland's arrival in Shanghai is for this purpose.

Two Weeks' Stay Planned in Shanghai

Mr. Kirkland arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:20 pm from Hong Kong on the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Ming Sheng ship and landed at the Roosevelt Wharf on the Bund. The U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Lockhart, personally went to the wharf to greet him. Upon arrival in Shanghai, Mr. Kirkland remained tight-lipped and politely declined to answer questions from visiting reporters. It is understood that Mr. Kirkland will discuss the issue of stabilizing Shanghai's legal tender with the Shanghai banking community in his capacity as an economic expert from the Exchange Equalization Fund, and will also investigate the management of foreign exchange in Shanghai by the Exchange Equalization Fund. At the same time, he will listen to reports from the Shanghai business community to understand the consequences of the U.S. implementation of the freezing order. He is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for two weeks before returning to Hong Kong to report. It is also reported that the Exchange Equalization Fund and British and American economic experts will convene an important meeting in Hong Kong next month to discuss the management of foreign exchange. Mr. Nie Mayer is currently in Chongqing and will soon go to Hong Kong to attend. It is still uncertain whether Mr. Kirkland will rush to participate. However, the rumor that the Chinese government will abandon the Shanghai market is refuted by the above circumstances.

In-Depth Study of the Actual Situation

Although the mission of Mr. Kirkland's trip to Shanghai is in principle similar to that of Mr. Fox, the American representative of the Exchange Equalization Fund, and Dr. Taylor, his assistant, Mr. Kirkland's arrival is particularly significant because it comes after the Three-Nation Economic Conference in Chongqing and at the time of the Hong Kong Financial Conference. According to well-informed sources, Mr. Kirkland's mission is to conduct a thorough investigation of Shanghai's import trade, the extent to which the Shanghai market needs imported goods, the complex commercial interests of various countries in Shanghai, and to define the status of friendly and non-friendly nations. He will also examine the true situation of Shanghai's abnormal black market foreign exchange, explore the reasons for its formation and methods to prevent it, and determine the amount of foreign exchange allocated by the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee for Shanghai's import of goods, so that all types of trade can benefit from it and not be exclusively enjoyed by a few special trades with preferential foreign exchange.

Film Industry Representative Returns to Shanghai on the Same Ship

Mr. Hague, the representative of Asia Film Company, who went to Hong Kong last month with representatives from other industries in Shanghai to contact the Exchange Equalization Fund on the issue of foreign exchange, returned to Shanghai yesterday on the Ming Sheng ship with Mr. Kirkland. Although Mr. Hague was unwilling to disclose the specific measures decided by the Exchange Equalization Fund regarding the film industry's request for foreign exchange, he indicated that the consultation had yielded considerable results and was not completely hopeless.

Foreign Exchange Problem May Be Solved Soon

It is understood that Mr. Hague stayed in Hong Kong for a long time and consulted with the Exchange Equalization Fund several times in order to obtain sufficient foreign exchange so that Shanghai cinemas could continue to operate without being affected by the U.S. freezing order. According to Mr. Hague, he has reported the progress of this trip to the authorities of Asia Film Company, and the issue of whether it can continue to operate can be resolved soon. Some film merchants also told reporters that they believe that unless sufficient foreign exchange is obtained and remitted to the United States to pay for film prices, they will have to stop operating. If American film merchants stop operating, the source of American films needed by Shanghai will be cut off. According to film merchants, recently officials in Chongqing have requested the import of a large number of American films to be transported to Free China, and the Exchange Equalization Fund should consider their request.

### Store Goods Should Be Marked with Prices

Stores in the French Concession should mark the prices of their goods in accordance with the police regulations. However, someone sent a letter to the newspaper expressing dissatisfaction with some stores that do not comply. The French Concession authorities hope that all sectors will cooperate with the Price Evaluation Committee and report to the nearby police station if they encounter stores that do not mark the prices of the goods they sell.

### The International Merchants Corps Seeks Members to Strengthen Defense Forces

The Shanghai International Merchants Corps in the Public Concession recently stated that the defense of "Zone B" is important, and because more than 200 British members have left Shanghai to join the military in the past two years, it has launched a campaign to recruit new members in order to strengthen its strength. The Corps' Motor Patrol held its annual meeting the day before, where Acting Commander Lieutenant Hans Lai gave a speech, urging all members to recruit new members to increase defense capabilities.

### There Is Absolutely No Problem with the Supply of Imported Rice by the Public Works Department

If Rice Shops Refuse to Sell, They Can Be Reported to the Police for Investigation. Underground Transactions in the Rice Market Must Be Stopped

The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating that some rice shops selling foreign rice from the Bureau have been reported to refuse to sell, claiming that they are out of stock. Therefore, it is hereby re-announced that if citizens discover the above situation, they are requested to immediately report to the nearest police station for verification. At the same time, no one or any organization is allowed to purchase the Bureau's foreign rice except for self-use, and no one may purchase more than one month's supply. The Bureau currently has a sufficient supply of foreign rice in stock to meet all needs. There is absolutely no reason to worry about the supply.

Afternoon Rice Market Needs to Be Stopped Urgently

Although the industry trading rules of the Grain and Oil Cake Exchange at 15 Edward Road have been repeatedly promulgated, they have ultimately been rendered useless due to the influence of speculators. In particular, the ban on afternoon grain trading has been repeatedly announced by the industry association, and the French Concession Police Department has also ordered compliance. However, these rice dealers are deliberately defying the regulations and secretly buying and selling grain in the market every afternoon, deliberately driving up prices and seriously harming people's food supply. This illegal trading is becoming increasingly rampant. If it continues to spread, the future of the people's food supply will be seriously affected. It is hoped that the French Concession authorities will immediately send personnel to thoroughly investigate the black market in the market in order to stabilize the market situation.

Rice Market Actually Pricing in Gold

The abundance of food reserves in the city is rare in recent decades, and it is the most abundant period since the war. Moreover, the source of domestic and foreign rice continues to arrive, and the monthly amount transported to Shanghai is considerable. According to the Jianghai Customs report, the total amount of foreign rice transported to Shanghai in September reached 447,673 hectoliters, valued at 4,751 customs gold units, equivalent to 12,735,761 yuan in national currency. At the same time, domestic rice transported to Shanghai is also more convenient and abundant. What is the prospect of the people's food supply? However, rice merchants are single-mindedly aiming to obtain illegal profits, resulting in the entire rice market being suddenly tight and difficult to alleviate. Recently, rice merchants in the market have even been pricing based on the rise and fall of gold. Such illegal activities cannot be allowed to continue to exist and urgently need to be strictly prohibited by the authorities.

Consumer Cooperation Can Achieve Great Results

By observing the current situation, we can see that most businesses in recent years have had a mentality of only seeking short-term gains and disregarding the consequences. A year ago, it was suggested that the only way to curb rising prices and make prices consistent with the purchasing power of money is to organize a consumer association. The association should have broad powers and, if necessary, can conduct consumer cooperative enterprises and sell goods to members at the lowest profit. In other words, the association can control the prices of daily necessities, so that the public can live, not just survive.

Cutting Off Contact with Black Market Transactions

The current French Municipal Council and the Public Works Department have implemented price controls, but they have only achieved partial results. It is heard that both parties are considering setting prices again, but it is feared that only partial success will be achieved. Why? Because there is no powerful consumer association to back them up. If there is a consumer association, it can cooperate with the authorities. The members of the association will unanimously refuse to purchase goods exceeding the regulated selling price from the black market or unregistered merchants.

Illegal Transactions Should Be Punished

In the United Kingdom, people who purchase goods from unregistered merchants at prices exceeding the government's regulated prices will be fined, including both the customer and the merchant. Will the Public Works Department also implement this method? For example, those who hoard gasoline will be fined 30 yuan. This measure will not prohibit hoarding but will only encourage it. In short, in any price control measure, it is difficult to succeed without the support of consumers and registered merchants.

Hoarding Goods Is Dangerous in the Future

Those who fear the outbreak of war and hoard goods in order to raise prices for sale should consider the actual advantages and disadvantages. If the war really comes to Shanghai due to Japan's attack on the United Kingdom and the United States, then regardless of who occupies Shanghai, whether for military or civilian needs, these warehouses full of goods will undoubtedly be requisitioned. It can be seen that hoarding goods during wartime is truly self-defeating. Those who hope to profit will inevitably lose. At that time, the general public will also believe that hoarders should share the same hardships as the rest of society, and no one will sympathize with their losses.

Chinese and Foreigners Share the Same Interests

At present, the war may not come, but those who hoard and profit still exist. Then, they will be allowed to use the guns made of their warehouses to do whatever they want to the people. If there is an organization of Chinese and foreign consumer associations, how can they act recklessly? In short, the price issue has the same meaning for both Chinese and foreigners, that is, the issue of the purchasing power of money. It is firmly believed that a strong consumer association can solve various consumer problems and solve the difficulties encountered by the authorities in the two concessions, and the purchasing power of millions of people can also be increased.

### 30,000 White Russians in Shanghai Pledge Allegiance to the Soviet Union

Immigrant Council Meets Today, Discussing Banning Aid to the Soviet Union

The Shanghai White Russian Immigration Committee is scheduled to meet on the 26th (today) to discuss increasing income tax on members and intensifying the ban on members continuing to support the Soviet Union. 30,000 White Russians in Shanghai are waiting for the results of this meeting. They have little complaint about the increase in income tax, but the vast majority of them completely sympathize with the Soviet Union, regardless of the policies of the Immigration Committee. Furthermore, the Committee threatens members who sympathize with the Soviet Union with depriving them of their membership. Many White Russian leaders have expressed resentment about this. At the same time, the number of White Russian immigrants donating to the Soviet Red Cross is increasing every day. Hundreds of people have applied to the Soviet Consulate in Tokyo for Soviet citizenship due to the ambiguous attitude of the Immigration Committee. Many believe that the decision of the Immigration Committee has given White Russians here a greater opportunity to obtain Soviet passports.

### American Prisoner Tait Pomp Escorted

By Mr. Mense, Scheduled to Leave Shanghai Next Tuesday

The Shanghai Times reported that Tait Pomp, the former deputy executive officer of the U.S. Court for China, who was sentenced to five years in prison for embezzlement of public property and concealment of the truth, will be escorted back to McNeil Island Penitentiary in the United States. Due to the difficulty in obtaining cabin space on ships between Shanghai and San Francisco, and the lack of anyone to escort him back to the United States, Tait is currently imprisoned in the Ward Road Prison. U.S. Marshal Mr. Mense, who has retired as the director of the Traffic Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police, will depart for Seattle to work for the U.S. government. He was asked to be responsible for escorting Tait back to the United States. Mr. Mense was sworn in as a special deputy executive officer at the U.S. Court on Thursday and is scheduled to escort Tait to board the French Postal Company's Dada Nanhao next Tuesday to leave Shanghai and land in Manila. Tait will be temporarily detained in the local prison for about five days, and then board the President Holbrook to San Francisco and then to McNeil Island, where Tait will be handed over to the prison authorities. Mr. Mense's mission will be completed.

### To Curb Rising Prices, Consumer Associations Should Be Formed

Assist the Authorities in Effectively Managing Prices, Refuse to Purchase Goods Exceeding the Price

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury published an article yesterday, which is translated as follows. According to economic principles, prices increase faster than wages, and wages fall faster than prices. However, this principle seems to no longer apply to Shanghai, just as other economic principles do not apply to Shanghai. The so-called wages do not refer to the currency circulating in Shanghai. Currency is merely a symbol. Every worker, whether Chinese or foreign, is greatly related to the purchasing power of money. If supply and demand can be adjusted to maintain the normal state of purchasing power, the social situation may not be so pessimistic. The misapplication of economic principles has led to various adverse environments.

### Navy YMCA Building Used as American Military Club

All Equipment Provided for American Military Use, Weekly Film Screenings and Dances

The U.S. 4th Marines Club was originally located opposite the Zonghui on Xiejiao Road in Jing'an Temple Road, but because the building was sold to the Jewish General Association for one million yuan, it was sold at the beginning of this month. However, as there were no suitable buildings available for the time being, the club's work was suspended. The department originally intended to rent the Baishanjing Hall on Avenue Edward VII and the fifth floor of the Great World Company, but neither was successful. According to news yesterday, after compromise negotiations, the department has decided to rent the Navy YMCA on Sichuan Road as the club's location. Yesterday, the U.S. military headquarters in Shanghai announced that the staff of the Navy YMCA have agreed to provide all the equipment of the association for the use of the U.S. military. The success of this matter is entirely due to the cooperation and assistance of Mr. Su Sen, the general secretary of the association. As for the club's schedule, there will be film screenings every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Starting next week, there will be dances every Saturday night from 8:00 pm to 11:15 pm. The U.S. military string band will be on site to perform and provide entertainment.

### Famous White Russian Military Strategist Mo Commits Suicide

Accused of Illegally Setting Up Radio Station in the French Concession, Unwilling to Be a Prisoner, Dies by Suicide

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that White Russian General Molochkovsky, 45, who had served as a military advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and participated in military affairs in the Chinese army, lived at 559D Route Lafayette. The French Concession Police Department discovered that he had set up a secret radio station in the concession. At 8:05 am this morning (the 26th), they went to his residence to arrest him. Mr. Mo shot himself.

Radio Station Uncovered, Involving Mr. Mo

The matter was subsequently officially announced by the French Police Department. It was stated that a secret radio station was uncovered yesterday (the 25th) at 19 Route Tenant de la Tour, and a Chinese radio operator was arrested. Under strict interrogation, it was learned that the radio station was managed by a White Russian. Therefore, this morning, detectives were sent to Mr. Mo's residence at 559D Route Lafayette. According to an officer of the French Police Department, the detectives only wanted to conduct an inquiry.

Detectives Arrive, Suicide by Shooting

However, when Mr. Mo saw the detectives enter his residence, he immediately shot himself. The bullet entered his temple and he died instantly. At the time, Mr. Mo's wife and two young children were also in the residence. It was found that Mr. Mo had become a Chinese citizen and had assisted Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek for many years. However, it is believed that he severed relations about eight months ago and has been working in Shanghai for private organizations in Chongqing for the past few months. During the Shanghai War in 1932, Mr. Mo participated in the planning in the 88th Division, assisting the 19th Route Army in fighting in Zhabei and Jiangwan. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Mr. Mo commanded a column of armored trains at the North Railway Station and Zhabei, covering the retreat of the Chinese army.

Long Time in China, Participated in Important Matters

Mr. Mo's first wife died in South China, leaving behind two sons. Mr. Mo then remarried and brought his family to Shanghai two years ago. In 1926, Mr. Mo first came to China from Siberia and served under Zhang Zongchang. In 1928, he managed the military trains in North China. The following year, he joined Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and was appointed as a general in the Chinese National Army.

Four Chinese Arrested One After Another

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reported that the Public Concession Police Department, together with the Japanese Military Police, arrested four Chinese radio operators in the Public Concession this morning (the 26th).

### Donations to the Pingmin Lung Disease Hospital Are Enthusiastic

The Shanghai Pingmin Lung Disease Hospital is established to provide relief to poor people with lung disease. Since its opening, many poor people with lung disease have sought medical treatment. The original 50 beds were soon filled, and the number has been increased to 100, but the supply still falls short of demand. Currently, funds are being raised to expand the hospital.

### The Struggle for Luo Jialing's Estate Intensifies After Her Death

The Jewish tycoon Hardoon and his wife, Luo Jialing, passed away one after the other. The distribution of their enormous estate, valued at eighty million yuan, has attracted widespread attention. Currently, there are four parties competing for the estate, and the four-way battle has just begun, with the situation

Escalating

This was to be expected, and even impartial observers are unable to predict the outcome. According to yesterday’s Shanghai Times, one of the parties contesting the estate consists of ten individuals residing in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, who claim to be close relatives of the late Hardoon. They have engaged Okamoto, a Japanese lawyer in this city, to represent them and demand 65.2% of Hardoon’s estate. It is reported that Okamoto has already submitted a notice to the British Assessor’s Office on behalf of his clients, stating that the

Estate Distribution Method

Determined by Luo Jialing is illegal because Luo Jialing was a Chinese citizen, not a British citizen. The dispute over Hardoon’s estate began even before Luo Jialing’s death on October 3. Last month, ten individuals named Hardoon, residing in Baghdad, requested 65.2% of the estate, claiming that this amount was stipulated by Iraqi inheritance law, as the late Hardoon was originally from Iraq and later became a British citizen. Okamoto, the Japanese lawyer, was entrusted by these ten individuals to

Make This Request

To Luo Jialing, but received no response. With Luo Jialing’s sudden death at the beginning of this month, the competition for the estate became even more intense. According to Luo Jialing’s will, the lawyers Abraham and Laid from Gao Yi Law Firm were appointed as estate administrators, and the British Assessor’s Office was requested to verify the will. Anyone who believed that the will should not be executed was required to declare their objections to the two lawyers within ten days. Before the ten days were up, another party suddenly argued that Luo Jialing was a Chinese citizen,

Not a British Subject

And therefore had no right to dispose of the estate, lodging a protest with the British Consulate General in Shanghai. Reliable sources report that diplomatic action is currently being taken on this matter. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed that Luo Jialing had left a second will, written after the first will, dated September 30, 1937, rendering the first will invalid. The exact date on which it was drawn up

Second Will

Was handled by Rogers, an American lawyer at the law firm of Rogers, and a notice has also been sent to the British Assessor’s Office. Notably, the first will appointed Laid and Abraham as estate administrators, while the second will replaced Laid with Ji Juemi as administrator alongside Abraham.

### Puyi Arts and Crafts Society Solicits Rags and Old Clothes, Raising Funds to Aid and Educate Disaster Victims

In view of the suffering of many refugees who are starving, cold, exposed to the elements, the Puyi Arts and Crafts Society has been organizing arts and crafts relief work for three and a half years. Fortunately, thanks to the support of all sectors of society, it has been able to continue to this day. Recently, due to soaring prices and difficulties in providing supplies, in order to maintain all existing programs and expand the scope of relief, it launched a 50,000-yuan fundraising campaign last week, hoping that people from all walks of life will actively support and cooperate.

Relief Numbers

The society provides daily relief to more than 1,000 elderly, weak, and disabled refugees, including 250 refugee workers who are provided with food, clothing, and wages to sustain their lives, as well as vocational training in over 40 different skills. Over 500 are orphans and out-of-school children, whom the society educates and cares for so that they can study and learn. Over 300 are refugees suffering from various diseases, to whom the society provides free medical care, distributing cod liver oil, oatmeal, and other foods as needed to supplement their inadequate nutrition. Another 200 or so are elderly, sick, unable to work, pregnant, giving birth, or bereaved, whom the society assists by distributing rice, wheat, and cash to prevent these impoverished people from becoming beggars.

Training Refugee Workers

The society trains hundreds of male and female refugee workers every day, utilizing old clothes, rags, furniture, machinery, toys, and other waste materials donated by all sectors of society, under the guidance of technicians or foremen, to train them so that "everything is used to its fullest potential, and everyone is used to their fullest potential." After a certain period, efforts are made to introduce them to work in various places to promote the spirit of self-reliance. Since this newspaper introduced the society, people from all walks of life have been writing to the society, entrusting it to find talent and arrange introductions, and then training unemployed vagrants or refugees to fill their vacancies. Such extensive relief not only reduces the number of vagrants foraging along the streets, posing a serious threat to citizens, but also prevents sick beggars from dying on the streets and spreading disease.

Enthusiastic Support

Since the society launched the 50,000-yuan disaster relief fundraising campaign, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have actively supported it, donating cash or clothing, which has been increasing daily, demonstrating that the society's active arts and crafts relief has won the sympathy of society. However, the target is still far away, and continued support is hoped for. This week, the society has received 300 yuan from Xi Shijing, 100 yuan from Zhang Daosheng, 1,010 yuan raised by Tang Shuming, 100 yuan from the estate of Ms. Chen Shufang, 200 yuan from Ms. Zhu Jizhen, 500 yuan from Chengdetang, 100 yuan from Lida Foreign Company, 400 yuan raised by Ding Dafu, 2,821 yuan raised by Qingxin Girls' School, 490 yuan jointly donated by 16 others, 235 yuan from three Westerners, totaling 6,256 yuan in cash. In addition, Tongyi Yarn Factory donated a large package of 20-count yarn worth over 2,000 yuan. Those who wish to donate, please call 16082 or notify the society's office at 115 Hankou Road, 2nd floor.

### Children and Science

— Yang Chunlv

"The 20th century is the century of children," which is something that modern children can be very proud of. But children, don't forget that the 20th century is also a century of science. Therefore, the children of the 20th century must have a scientific mind and a pair of scientific hands to cope with the scientific century of the 20th century in order to be worthy of being the masters of this century.

The "Nature" that children learn in school is the subject that enhances your scientific knowledge and can turn your mind into a scientific mind. You should study hard, think deeply, study carefully, and seek a thorough understanding. Outside of class, you should also read more scientific books and newspapers, and often come into contact with nature to observe everything in the natural world and acquire rich scientific knowledge to enrich your scientific mind.

Having a scientific mind alone is not enough. You also need a pair of scientific hands. "Use your hands and your brain, that's the best!" Have you seen this slogan? A pair of scientific hands can only be created through experimentation. Therefore, once you have scientific knowledge, you should do scientific experiments yourself.

Combining your hands and brain in this way can not only increase your interest in research, but also create new things. You must know that any great inventor is not a natural freak. Our brains and hands are no different from theirs. Those who have the will can also achieve it.

Dear children! Our country is now struggling in suffering. Shouldn't we catch up quickly, take on the mission of promoting science, and catch up?

One day, Brother Duck and Little Chicken went out to play together. Little Chicken disappeared halfway. Brother Duck looked for it for a long time but couldn't find it. Children! Can you find it for him?

### Rotary Club and Old Toys

— Shadow Dull

We've probably heard the term "Rotary Club" a lot, right? It's an organization, but its structure is different from other groups. Regardless of nationality, men and women from all countries can join. Meetings are held weekly, and the convener is rotated among the members, hence the name "Rotary Club." Moreover, the meetings are informal. A unique aspect is that members absolutely do not discuss political issues at gatherings.

The Rotary Club's history is only about thirty years old. It was initially founded by a few people in Chicago, USA. However, today, after thirty years, the Rotary Club has spread throughout the world, with thousands of branches. The number of members is also in the tens of thousands, demonstrating rapid growth. In China, major cities like Beijing, Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Shanghai now have Rotary Clubs.

The Rotary Club's purpose is twofold: to foster camaraderie among members and to engage in charitable activities. For example, the Shanghai Rotary Club, in addition to its regular weekly meetings on Thursdays, always does charity work during Christmas. A special activity is collecting toys for underprivileged children. Besides placing advertisements in newspapers to solicit old toys, they also screen films for the public, charging no admission fee, only accepting new or used toys, one per person.

Although the current situation is very chaotic, the Rotary Club is continuing this work this year because they realize that there are many children in charitable institutions who never see toys all year round, which is very pitiful. Therefore, they collect old toys, repair them, and distribute them to poor children before Christmas as gifts so they can play with toys like other children.

On October 26th, this Sunday, at 10:30 AM, the Rotary Club will publicly screen a new film for toy collection at the Nanjing Grand Theater. You don't have to spend money to see the movie; just bring an old toy. Fortunately, old toys are useless at home. Giving them can provide toys for underprivileged children, which is killing two birds with one stone. What wouldn't the children want to do that!

The Rotary Club has a "toy hospital" and employs many experts to repair toys. Therefore, after the collected old toys are repaired by the toy hospital, they are as good as new. Every year, they use various methods to collect old toys from all walks of life. After repairing them, they distribute them to underprivileged children throughout Shanghai during Christmas. Isn't this a charitable work worth supporting?

### I Dropped Out of School

— Da

I am a person without perseverance. Not to mention anything else, I don't even have perseverance in studying. My parents paid my tuition, and I should have studied hard; but my temper is terrible, and I insisted on learning a trade day and night. Finally, I dropped out of school one day last Saturday and joined a pharmaceutical factory. There, the huge machines required me to work twelve hours a day. After two days, I couldn't take it anymore, so I returned home; but because of this, I dropped out of school.

Children! After reading the above, I hope you will focus on your studies and not be as lacking in perseverance as I was, disappointing your parents' efforts.

### More About the Most Powerful Airplane

— Jin Zhen

Last time, A-Wei's brother only talked about the interesting anecdotes of a silent airplane. Because he had something to do, he interrupted his story. Therefore, A-Wei was always looking for a good opportunity to ask his brother to continue the story because he was really enjoying it. Finally, one afternoon, in the evening, his brother was lying on the sofa reading the newspaper. He seized this opportunity and said to his brother, "Brother, didn't you promise me last time that if you had the chance, you would continue talking about the most powerful airplane? Isn't today a good opportunity? Can you continue the story? I like hearing about airplanes the most."

"Okay, let's continue. Last time, I talked about the silent airplane. Today, I'm talking about a type of airplane that can be equipped with a large cannon, which can also be considered the most powerful airplane. This type of airplane equipped with a cannon was invented by the British and has now been successfully developed. It is said that this airplane can fly more than two hundred miles per hour, which is a good speed. Moreover, it can fire cannons while flying and can accurately hit the target. The person firing the cannon can sit safely in the airplane's cabin, aiming at the target to be attacked. No matter what the position, the cannonball is guaranteed to hit the target once fired because the cannonball is fired not manually but entirely by an automatic device, just like the cannons on armored warships. There is also a type of airplane that spreads anti-aircraft dust. This type of airplane does not attack the enemy but defends against enemy airplanes indiscriminately bombing cities. It was also invented by the British. It is said that this anti-aircraft dust is a metallic powder similar to smoke. As soon as an alarm is heard that enemy airplanes are approaching, the anti-aircraft airplanes immediately ascend into the air to spread the anti-aircraft dust. Just a few airplanes can quickly create a layer of invisible anti-aircraft dust around the sky of an important city. If any enemy airplane enters this dust, the metallic powder can damage the enemy airplane's engine, preventing it from advancing and causing it to crash. If the enemy airplane already knows the height of the anti-aircraft dust and wants to fly above it, it is a difficult task, especially for large bombers. Therefore, this is a safe and effective anti-aircraft method, but it is not easy to use, so we have not yet seen this method used for air defense in newspapers. There is also a type of smoke-spraying airplane that looks like a military airplane, but it is equipped with a machine for spraying asphalt (commonly called tar) smoke. When bombing, it does not need to fly low to drop bombs. It can simply drop bombs made of asphalt, poison, and easily combustible chemicals from the air. The bomb will spray smoke in the air before landing, burning the enemy's supplies and suffocating soldiers. This type of airplane is very scary. Finally, there is a type of mysterious airplane invented by the Americans that uses radio waves to automatically pilot itself, so there is no need for a person in the airplane. It is said to have flown over the Pacific Ocean for three hours at a fast speed, and the result is considered successful. In wartime, as long as this type of airplane is fully loaded with bombs and flown to the enemy to bomb, if there is an accident, at most an airplane is lost, without sacrificing the lives of any soldiers. These are the most powerful airplanes."

### General Situation of Chinese Hospitals: Well-Organized and Fully Equipped, Providing Free Childbirth Services to the Impoverished, Benefiting the Common People

Since Dr. Wang Boyuan took charge of the Chinese Hospital, he has carefully planned and prepared on a large scale. The internal organization is well-structured, and the various facilities are complete. The main departments include internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics, ophthalmology, smoking cessation, cardiology, gastroenterology, dermatology, urology and reproductive medicine, emergency poisoning treatment, otolaryngology, X-ray, physical therapy, electrotherapy, etc. Each department is staffed by specialized physicians responsible for treatment. With their rich experience, they fulfill their professional duties to the fullest. Therefore, patients who seek treatment often recover quickly, and the hospital has gained a good reputation, with its services becoming increasingly developed, benefiting patients greatly. The hospital is affiliated with the Hongkou Public Obstetrics Hospital, which provides safe childbirth services with remarkable results. It also provides free childbirth services to extremely impoverished mothers, offering dedicated service and earning the praise of society. The hospital's main address is at Huajie Road, Tilanqiao, and the branch is at Xinzhazhi Road, Park Road. The telephone numbers are 50004 and 37047. There are no other branches.

### Shou Chun Kettle Studio Opera Notes

— Su Shaoqing

On Tan Fuying's Voice

Every actor's voice changes due to environmental factors: (1) With increasing age, the voice changes from a boy's voice to a young adult's voice, and then to an old voice; (2) The diligence or laziness in using the voice. If the voice is not used often, it becomes stiff, like rusty steel; (3) The strength or weakness of the body. A strong body has abundant energy, and the voice is loud and powerful. Weakness and illness lead to shortness of breath and an empty voice. Tan Fuying was only twelve or thirteen years old when he entered the Fuyuncheng opera school. I heard him sing opera for the first time when he made his debut. The voice was a boy's voice, and the tune was the ordinary tune of the opera school. He had a good appearance and was much fatter than he is now, which was very pleasing. Later, he lost his voice, and it took a long time for his voice to come back. The key was very low, and singing was very strenuous. Therefore, he changed to a low tune to cope with his voice, inevitably using a bit of a nasal tone. This lasted for a long time. Later, seeing Ma Shuliang stand out, he began to work hard and was able to train his voice to be very wide, high, and loud, leaping to a level playing field with Ma Lianliang. For several years, the two Mas, in order to safeguard the friendship between colleagues and classmates, gave way to each other and refused to compete on two stages in Shanghai at the same time, which was a good approach. Last time when Fuying performed at the Gengxin Theater, I listened to him several times. His voice was wide and bright, and he was very energetic. This time, he is performing on the Grand Stage again. People who have heard him sing say that his voice is slightly narrower than last time, which makes me very concerned. I heard Fuying sing "The Tassel Unseating" that day. This play is an old one with a good meaning, but the atmosphere was a bit cold, and there were not many singing lines. Many people did not find it very satisfying, and I will not comment on it. I will only discuss his voice. How does it compare to his performance last time? Last year at the Gengxin Theater, Fuying's voice was so wide that it could be called invincible, but I carefully tasted his voice and felt that it was wide but not tight. One piece of evidence is that he could not sing in a high falsetto because he could not tighten his throat. Now, I hear his voice in "The Tassel Unseating" and feel that it is more full and tight than last year. When he sings loudly, it can also resonate throughout the hall. Judging from this, Fuying's voice has improved, and he should be able to sing in a high falsetto. This is good news. His father, Xiao Pei, should say, "Let me thank heaven and earth." His grandfather, Yingxiu, if he knew in the afterlife, would also smile and say, "With this voice, he is worthy of being a descendant of the Tan family." I also have good advice to offer. I advise Fuying to pursue his singing skills further, take good care of his body, so that we can listen to him and relieve our sorrows.

### Shanghai Rotary Club to Screen Free Movie This Morning

— New Film

One Toy for One Ticket

Although the world is full of terror, time passes so quickly, and Christmas is not far away. The Shanghai Rotary Club, as usual, will publicly screen toy-collecting films several times before Christmas to distribute the collected toys to underprivileged children who have not seen toys all year round.

The screening of this toy-collecting film will continue this year. The first screening is scheduled for today (Sunday) at 10:30 AM at the Nanjing Grand Theater. The films screened include cartoons, newsreels, and comedies, covering a wide range of genres.

People who want to see the movie don't have to spend money; just bring a toy to exchange for a ticket. The condition of the toy, whether new or old, doesn't matter. If you don't have a toy, there will be toys for sale at the theater entrance that day.

All the old toys collected will be immediately sent to the Rotary Club's toy hospital for repair so that they can be distributed to underprivileged children in charitable institutions throughout the city during Christmas as a gift. The Rotary Club's target is to collect 10,000 toys. Therefore, after the first public screening at the Nanjing Grand Theater, it may also be screened at other theaters.

Chapter 18: Swearing to Wipe Out the Huns Regardless of Personal Safety

"I was born with copper muscles and iron bones. General Wu doesn't order me to kill a few more rebels happily on the battlefield, but instead orders me to be a Kunlun slave, stealing the red silk for him. Although I, Lao Zhang, am a rough martial artist, calculating it, it's not worth it, unlike in times of peace, when I was raised by General Wu, it wouldn't hurt to do it for him. But at this moment, I don't want to be a private lackey." Chen Fei said, "If General Wu could decide to fight the rebels, he should have raised his troops and horses long ago and attacked Beijing, that would be the right thing to do, so that his beloved concubine could be rescued from the hands of the rebels. Who told him to retreat here, allowing the rebels to be rampant?" Bai Shier saw that everyone did not agree with San Gui's request. He knew that Zhang Cangqiu and others were heroic and straightforward in temperament. No matter what happened, they spoke frankly and did not flatter private interests. Since they all said so, this matter was unlikely to be hopeful, so he said, "I am just conveying General Wu's meaning. If you are not willing to go, of course I would not dare to force you. Let's drink a few more cups." Zhang Cangqiu said, "If you want to teach me to drink, I will obey. 'Don't laugh at me for lying drunk on the battlefield; since ancient times, how many have returned from battle?' If I drink enough wine and go out to fight once, I will die happily. Now retreating here is really discouraging, I can't agree." Liu Yinying smiled and said, "I now know that General Wu's temperament is very hesitant and indecisive, lacking determination. It is very difficult to ask him to take on a major responsibility. My previous words unfortunately came true. It seems that his heart is completely tied to his beloved concubine, and national affairs are secondary to him." (202)
