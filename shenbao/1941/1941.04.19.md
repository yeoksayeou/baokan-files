### Soong Tzu-wen and Morgenthau to Sign Soon: Sino-American Equalization Fund Agreement, US Allocates 50 Million to Stabilize Legal Tender, Move Shows Washington's Resolve to Aid China

Washington - A senior official of the Treasury Department told the Associated Press yesterday that the Sino-American Equalization Fund Agreement will be signed before next Wednesday.

It is understood that a formal announcement may be made today. The agreement was verbally reached in December last year. The Treasury Department will allocate 50 million US dollars to stabilize Chinese legal tender. Observers said that the determination to conclude the agreement shows that the United States has revived its intention to aid China. (Eighteenth Associated Press Dispatch)

Chongqing - This morning, the Ta Kung Pao carried an editorial saying that Japan and the Soviet Union have long been trying to provoke each other's relationship. The Soviet Union wants to cope with the threat to its western border, and Japan is focused on China. However, the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty will not necessarily lead Japan to take action in the South Pacific or launch a new major offensive in China. Japan has stationed eight divisions, totaling 200,000 troops, in Manchuria, namely the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th, 12th, 21st, and 24th Divisions. The 1st Division has been withdrawn to Japan, the 4th Division has been sent to Hankou and participated in the Henan-Hubei battle in February, and the 8th Division has been transferred to Shanghai. Even if the other divisions remain in Manchuria, there are currently five divisions there, but most of them cannot be withdrawn because if a large portion of the Japanese army were to withdraw, the 100,000 Manchurian troops would be likely to revolt at any time. It is heard that part of the Japanese Air Force stationed in Manchuria was transferred to Hainan Island in February. Therefore, we believe that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty will not affect the status of Hainan or China. The agreement is merely a move by Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka to save face, in order to counter the Japanese people's criticism of Japan's joining the Tripartite Pact as a miscalculation.

### Guo Tai-chi Issues Statement Saying Soviet Union Has Not Changed Its Policy Towards China

London - The newly appointed Chinese Foreign Minister Guo Tai-chi left London by plane yesterday for New York, and will travel to Chongqing via Washington. (Eighteenth Associated Press Dispatch)

London - Guo Tai-chi, the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, is scheduled to return to China today to take up the post of Foreign Minister. He told a Reuters reporter yesterday that he had received a telegram from the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union stating that the Soviet Union had not changed its policy towards China or intended to stop aid to China. He heard that Matsuoka had never mentioned China in his talks in Moscow. In recent months, Ambassador Guo often stayed overnight at the home of Lord Woven in Sonning, but last night he stayed at the embassy. Ambassador Guo said that, to his knowledge, the German air raid was most severe on Wednesday night, but fortunately the Chinese Embassy was safe except for some broken window panes. While Ambassador Guo was receiving the Reuters reporter, there were many letters and telegrams expressing goodwill, and farewell gifts, including several photographs of the King and Queen of England in a large silver frame, and a photograph of British Prime Minister Churchill, and a commemorative silver cup jointly presented by Chinese friends. Most of the above items will be left in London and will be shipped back to China after the war is over. Ambassador Guo went to various places to say goodbye yesterday. It is not yet known when Dr. Gu Weijun, the successor to Ambassador Guo, will arrive here. Dr. Gu is currently in Vichy and can only come to the UK via Spain and Portugal. However, China has not recognized the Franco government, so Dr. Gu will not be able to enjoy diplomatic privileges when passing through Spain, and can only cross Spain as a prominent foreign figure.

### Chongqing Communist Party Comments on Soviet-Japanese Treaty: China Will Suffer Disadvantage

Chongqing - A prominent Chinese Communist Party member here declared today that whether China will suffer disadvantage as a result of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty depends largely on China itself. The Chinese Communist Party here pointed out that the Soviet-Japanese pact is, of course, for the national interests of the Soviet Union. The main purpose of the Great Chinese Communist Party is for China, China's independence and liberation, and the recovery of Manchuria. A Communist Party analyst analyzed the situation of the Soviet-Japanese treaty, saying that Japan can certainly withdraw part of its garrison in Manchuria, and will probably first transfer this army to the south to strengthen "the Japanese army in Vietnam." He believes that before Germany can cut off traffic through the Mediterranean, Japan will not attack the Dutch East Indies or other parts of Southeast Asia. Cutting off traffic in the Mediterranean will take at least several months. Japan will use this period to consolidate its bases and strength in Vietnam, and may attack Yunnan and increase bombing of the Yunnan-Burma Road. He pointed out that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov had assured Chongqing that the Soviet Union would continue to aid China. If China uses its full strength to fight against Japan during this period, it can not only resist the Japanese army in the south, but also accumulate a large amount of heavy military equipment with the aid of the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States. He believes that after this situation, China can become a truly important element in the general situation in the Pacific. At the same time, the official Central News Agency announced that General Kong Helong, a guerrilla commander who left the Communist Party Central Committee in 1934, had advised the Communist Party army to obey all orders from Chongqing. He issued a statement from the front line, urging the Communist Party to immediately abolish the Communist Party headquarters "Border Government" in Yan'an, and for the Eighteenth Route Army to absolutely obey the orders of the high command.

Editorial

### The Future of the Shanghai Municipal Council

The organization of the Shanghai Public Concession Provisional Council was approved by a special meeting of Western ratepayers on the 17th of this month and was established. This violates the Yangjingbang Regulations and the consistent policy of the United Kingdom and the United States of not changing the status quo of Shanghai, but it has actually evolved into a reality. Examining its motives, it is solid for the sake of the current safety of the entire city of Shanghai. Examining its theoretical principles, it is like the words of Ke Zewei, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, who said, "The solution to the problems we are currently encountering depends on the cooperation of all responsible persons in the Public Concession, regardless of their nationality." The Provisional Council is said to be the concrete expression of the cooperation of responsible persons from various countries. However, the problem of the Chinese directors has not yet been resolved, and the theoretical cooperation and factual cooperation have not yet been integrated. There are many detours, and optimism is premature. Now, before the premise of a smooth and reasonable solution to all matters, I will state what I hope for:

The Shanghai Concession is the most internationally colorful area. Now it is in the process of planned evolution, and it is trending towards a situation of monopolization and division. Especially at present and in the future, it will take advantage of the turbulent world situation to intensify its oppression and destruction. Therefore, those who have always regarded the Concession as the only joy above security are now deeply aware that the rule of law is gone, human rights are not guaranteed, every step is thorny, and they shudder in fear. This situation almost makes Shanghai fundamentally lose its value for survival. It should be known that the prosperity of the Public Concession today is due to the pioneering efforts of the British and American people, the management of the Chinese people, and the respect of the people of all countries for the position of the Concession authorities, and the fact that they have never attempted to undermine or hinder their administrative power. With no worries about security and no fear of turmoil, those who had businesses operated in the Concession; those who were looking for a place to live rented in the Concession; goods were imported and exported through the Concession; and property was stored in the Concession. For nearly a hundred years, although there has been disturbance in the Chinese mainland, the tranquility of the Shanghai Concession has remained the same; thus, there is today's prosperity. If you look at China, the existence of concessions is not limited to Shanghai, but only the Shanghai Public Concession has prosperity, precisely because of its "public" nature.

The past is gone, and the future can be pursued; especially since it is named "provisional," everything is a provisional measure, and efforts should be made to ensure that it does not affect the spirit of the original laws and regulations. The original laws and regulations still exist, and are the foundation of Shanghai. Furthermore, efforts should be made to ensure that it does not affect future measures. Future measures should shift according to the Chinese policy where sovereignty lies, and should not be affected by the temporary organization. Therefore, what is being done today is only to have a temporary organization during the temporary period to cope with temporary incidents! Only in this way can we hope that the Provisional Council of the Municipal Council will make its greatest efforts to maintain the inherent good position of Shanghai without being controlled by any one force. In other words, the original status quo should be maintained if it is still being maintained, and restored if it is incomplete. In the past, the administration of the Public Concession could still be blamed on the British people for controlling the key points. Today, the British people in Shanghai are willing to sacrifice small things to maintain the overall situation and reduce their number of directors, and are in the same position as the United States and Japan. The Chinese taxpayers are also willing to remember the painstaking efforts of the British and American people, and seek completeness with reservations. They are temporarily willing to retreat to four seats, and the overseas Chinese from Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland are also participating in the board of directors; Judging from the signs, it is a clear indication of cooperation. Nationalities are different, and skin colors are yellow and white, but they are all "members" of the Shanghai society. Since they live in the same society, they should only work together for the welfare of the society. Be careful not to change their will or influence their actions because of international grudges, or prejudices about race and wealth, or arrogance about temporary advantages in address. Do not think that you can ask for whatever you want and that no one can poison you. Be calm and leave a small piece of land in Shanghai so that Chinese and foreigners can both benefit themselves and benefit others.

Regardless of how urgent future world changes may be, and how the overseas Chinese in Shanghai cannot forget their own interests, it seems that it is appropriate for today's Provisional Council to deal with the temporary situation. It is hoped that the representatives of overseas Chinese from various countries will gather together, and those who are concerned about the overall interests of Shanghai will transcend the matter and work hard to obtain the necessary safety and convenience for Shanghai. Divide the work, cooperate, and work together. Even if things are difficult and huge, there will surely be visible results.

However, although the Municipal Council has a history of nearly a hundred years, and all the directors who have served in the past have been outstanding members of the overseas Chinese community, they do not seem to have a deep understanding of the situation of Chinese society. In peacetime, what the Municipal Council does is only part of the municipal administration within the Concession, and there should be no problems. Today, some civil affairs are also concentrated on the Municipal Council. If the Municipal Council does not have a deep research on the entire society and seek a reasonable solution, even if there are good laws and good intentions, it will not be able to achieve success. What about food in the past two years? As for the housing problem, recently, landlords have used foreign merchants and rental agencies to widely communicate, demolishing houses, renovating them for sale, and subletting them with various harsh means, oppressing tenants and demanding small rental fees and other expenses. Adding to the rent, the tenants have no choice, and there is no administrative way to provide protection and relief? Therefore, the layers of exploitation suffered by landlords and rental agencies cannot be described. Furthermore, the general price of goods is high, life is becoming more and more difficult, and labor unrest is surging. There are endless reports. It is impossible to know whether there are other backgrounds in this, but the Concession's response to labor unrest has not sought a way to trace the root. Another example is the fuel problem, which is no less serious than food. Ships transporting coal are constantly arriving; the coal stored in Shanghai is like a mountain, but the price is soaring, and there is no policy to stabilize it. Electricity is being controlled due to the coal shortage, which has had a great impact on the spear industry, which indirectly affects the workers. However, if the supply of coal can be increased and unnecessary electricity consumption can be stopped, then industrial electricity consumption does not need to be restricted in this way. Even the air-conditioning electricity consumption in summer can be stopped, and the electricity consumption of neon lights is also not necessary. Do not let it go because the quantity only accounts for one percent, it is necessary to know that the size of the percentage depends on its total value, one percent of a million is ten thousand times different from one percent of a hundred, this cannot be ignored.

These are all the few things that are indispensable for life, and are also the most serious problems at present. It should be known that the municipal administration of Shanghai is in the hands of foreigners, and Shanghai's various donations and taxes, in name, come from foreign merchants, but in reality, directly and indirectly, they are all borne by the Chinese people. The same society has special circumstances and very different lives, and often ignores the pain of the other side. How can those who have the responsibility of municipal administration diligently seek the suffering of the people, protect their livelihoods, and take effective measures to stabilize the order of society, so that the citizens of Shanghai may be slightly relieved?

### Fierce German Attacks, Wave After Wave; Unprecedented Battle Unfolds in Northern Greece; Elite British Troops Fully Block the Enemy's Southern Advance; Extremely Heavy Casualties on Both Offense and Defense

London: According to the latest front-line dispatches received here, although Greek forces may be forced to withdraw from Albania due to the collapse of organized resistance in Yugoslavia, the British front line in northern Greece has not moved an inch despite the full-scale German attack. It is reported that German troops suffered heavy casualties during repeated attempts to storm the heights of Mount Olympus, having been repeatedly hit hard by British and Imperial forces. The severity of the current general situation cannot be denied. If Greek forces withdraw from Albania, the British Imperial forces fighting alongside them will inevitably be affected. A Greek Information Ministry official stated today that the German army is focusing all its efforts on the Allied forces, suffering extremely heavy casualties. According to a Reuters correspondent, the German army is now exerting full pressure on Greece, with Hitler having transferred the elite of his troops to the battlefield, including special units and guards, whose soldiers are mostly young men around 20 years old. Australian troops are effectively resisting German efforts to directly approach the Thessalian Plain around Mount Olympus. According to an Australian officer, a German mechanized unit was destroyed. The Australian army also inflicted heavy damage on the German army near Souvala and northwest of Kozani. The German army is now advancing towards Kalabaka south of Souvala and Kozani. German communiques state that Souvala has been occupied. It is reported that the Olympus Pass is held by New Zealand troops, and the German army has so far failed to break through the main British front line at any point. A British mechanized unit officer told a Reuters correspondent that their tank attacks are superior to those of the enemy. Their shells can often destroy enemy tanks, but the enemy seems to have a slight advantage in numbers and is often assisted by motorcycle units, advancing in groups. The above describes the situation on the right flank of the Allied forces. News from other sources confirms that the fighting on the left flank is even more severe. Greek communiques state that Klisoura and Avdella have been safely evacuated. Klisoura is a few miles west of Tepeleni, and Avdella is located on the Greek border with Albania. (18th Reuters dispatch)

London: The Middle East British Forces communique announced that Greek and British Imperial forces on the northern Greek front, due to increasing German reinforcements and intensifying pressure, have gradually withdrawn to a shorter defensive line.

### Germany's Last Gamble; Youth Driven to the Battlefield

Allied Frontline in Greece: German troops, using hammer blow tactics to violently attack the Greek and Allied forces in an attempt to break through the front line, have suffered heavy casualties. The intensity of the German hammer blow tactics is no less than the blitzkrieg in the Western Front. At least three mechanized divisions, carefully selected Austrian Alpine troops, and a Hitler assault force composed of young men known as "Lightning Men" are participating in the war. Germany has disregarded all sacrifices and driven these troops into battle. The operational plan seems to be a modified French war. A reporter who visited yesterday saw many casualties among the British, Australian, and New Zealand troops, but they still held their positions. However, due to the German advance south of Grevena, the Allied front line may be expected to be rectified. (18th Taiwan Public News dispatch)

### The Fighting is Exceptionally Fierce Along the Entire Front; German Pressure Concentrated on Three Points

Athens: German mechanized troops in northern Greece are fiercely attacking the British and Greek front lines. According to the latest news, although the British and Greek front lines are under significant pressure, they are still holding firm. Australian troops are engaged in bloody battles around the city of Souvala, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The city is located a few miles west of Mount Olympus on the highway from Kozani to Larissa and is a key point on the left flank of the Allied front line. Extremely fierce fighting is also taking place thirty miles southwest of Souvala, where the British and Greek front lines turn towards Kalabaka. A German military communique stated last night that German troops are advancing towards Kalabaka. The Athens wireless radio station broadcast the latest military news from the front, stating, "The Allied right flank, from Katirlini (Gulf of Salonica) to Souvala, is currently blocking the German advance and constantly repelling it. The enemy in this area has suffered terrible losses. Yesterday afternoon, a squadron of British armored troops used machine guns to shoot down five German planes. The Allied left flank is also resisting strongly, and the enemy has not made any progress." In addition, a statement from the Greek Information Ministry stated that the war between Germany and Greece has expanded to the entire front and has entered an extremely serious stage. The German army is exerting all its efforts to attack the Allied forces, and the enemy is suffering heavy casualties. The three points where German pressure is concentrated are Grevena (north of Kalabaka), the south bank of the Haliacmon River, and west of Kozani. The German route attacking Grevena aims to capture Kalabaka. At the same time, the fighting in the Kozani area and the old Albanian border is also extremely fierce. On the old border, the German army seems to have occupied the Kavafetgarik ridge. The British Air Force continues to bomb enemy convoys, causing heavy losses to enemy troops and supplies. Furthermore, the Italian army's attacks on the Italian front line have been repelled, with heavy losses for the Italian army, and they have not gained any advantage at any point.

### German and Italian Forces Join Up and Advance into Albanian Territory; Serious Situation on the Battlefield

London: Well-informed sources in Cairo claim that the situation on the Albanian battlefield is "serious," and Greek forces there may need to withdraw. A large number of German troops in southern territory have moved south, repelling Greek forces covering the retreat in the Albanian region. This may affect British forces in Greece, so the severity of the Greek battlefield should not be underestimated. According to the latest news from the Macedonian front, the British and Greek front line, although under pressure, remains intact. Regarding the fighting in northern Greece, there is no new news except that fierce fighting is taking place north of Kalabaka. Greek communiques state that German troops are currently advancing towards Kalabaka. (18th Reuters dispatch)

Rome: US headquarters issued a special communique stating that the first line of Greek defense in Albania has been broken by the Italian army. "After three days of bloody battles on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, our army broke through the first Greek defense line. Our Tenth Army continued its unstoppable advance on Thursday morning. The enemy's entire line is on the verge of collapse. Our Eleventh Army has advanced towards Argirokastro and, with the cooperation of the Ninth Army, will meet in Ioannina (Greece). The Eleventh Army reached Klisoura on Wednesday night, only nineteen miles from Argirokastro, and has already arrived near the town yesterday." It is noted that Ioannina was an important target when the Italian army invaded Greece last October. (18th United Press dispatch)

Athens: Athens Radio broadcast a Greek headquarters communique stating that Greek forces at the Albanian front have safely withdrawn from Klisoura and Osek. (18th Reuters dispatch)

Rome: According to news received here, Italian tank units in northern Albania continued to advance towards Katallaro, Ragusa, and so forth yesterday. The team has already occupied the Yugoslav cities and towns of Antivari, Podgorica, and Cetinje. (18th Hai Tong dispatch)

### The Two Army Groups are Evenly Matched; It is Still Difficult to Predict Who Will Win

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the Italian and German forces and the Greek and British forces on the Greek front are currently engaged in a fierce battle for survival along a line stretching from Mount Olympus to the mountains of Albania by the Ionian Sea. Many places in this area cannot be invaded by non-military operations. The attacking army must advance along certain roads and valleys, while the defending army has the opportunity to make full use of its limited strength. The German army is attacking with tanks and motorized equipment, and its power is endless. However, those opposing the German army are elite soldiers of anti-war battlefields, and the difference in strength between the two armies is not as great as the numbers indicate. In terms of actual combat, there is currently no official news that can be used to make comments. (18th Reuters dispatch)

London: A correspondent from the "News Chronicle" in Athens reported that British, Greek, Australian, and New Zealand troops are bravely resisting Hitler's 1941 blitzkrieg north of the Larissa Plain. Fierce fighting is underway, and it is still difficult to predict who will win. After a long period of silence along the mountain front, German tanks suddenly appeared, first with fast-moving two-headed tanks, which were equally agile in advancing and retreating, followed by heavy tank units, mostly weighing 35 tons. Our army lay dormant, waiting for them to approach before bombarding them fiercely with flat-trajectory guns and rifles. At this range, even the thickest armor is difficult to resist. The German tank attacks are often reconnaissance in nature. Once they see a strong position, they retreat. In recent days, Allied forces have repelled many such attacks, but they keep returning in order to find weak points and break through. (18th Reuters dispatch)

### Berlin Officially Announces; Serbian Army Surrenders Unconditionally; Acknowledging that the War in Yugoslavia Has Now Ended; Will Now Focus on the War in Greece

Berlin: German radio stations broadcast the German military headquarters communique at 12:25 AM last night, announcing that the Serbian army has surrendered. (16th Hai Tong dispatch)

Berlin: A special communique from the German High Command stated that the war against the Serbian people has ended. The remaining Yugoslav troops have unconditionally laid down their arms. Yugoslavia surrendered at noon yesterday. Authoritative sources pointed out that with Yugoslavia having disappeared from the Balkan battlefield after eleven days of war, Hitler can now assemble his Nazi war machine in the southeast to fully attack the British and Greek Allied forces. Well-informed Nazi sources stated that German troops in northern Greece will likely be reinforced immediately. After the troops are reinforced, they can defeat the British and Greek forces. They also said that in the next few days, the German army in the southeast will concentrate all its strength to attack the British and Greek forces. (18th United Press dispatch)

### The Issue of Dividing Yugoslavia; A Meeting Will Be Held to Resolve It

### The Capital of Yugoslavia; The Terrible State of Being Bombed; More Than 10,000 Civilian Deaths

London: A Reuters special correspondent wired from a certain location in Yugoslavia stating that the capital of Yugoslavia has recently been subjected to German air raids, causing extremely heavy casualties among the people. According to inspectors who witnessed the tragic scene, it is estimated that no less than 11,000 residents of the capital of Yugoslavia were killed by the bombing. A gentleman who had previously seen the burning of Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Warsaw in Poland said that the tragedy of the massacre in the capital of Yugoslavia exceeded that of Rotterdam and Warsaw. The capital of Yugoslavia was completely unprepared for air raids. All of its air defense equipment was only a few poorly constructed air raid shelters. There was a shortage of water in the city, which made it impossible to extinguish the fires, and food and fuel soon ran out. During the first air raid, two air raid shelters were directly hit, and a barracks was also hit, killing 100 people in the barracks. The Prime Minister's residence, the Army Ministry, the Interior Ministry, and many other government offices were burned to the ground by noon on the first day. The most famous hotel in the capital of Yugoslavia, the "Sebesky Palace," was razed to the ground. The French, American, and Greek embassies were also affected. In the first raid, as many as hundreds of German planes participated, and their dive bombers dropped bombs from a high speed at a distance of 600 feet from the ground. At that time, many residents of the capital of Yugoslavia were standing in the streets, unaware that Germany had declared war on them, so the German attack can be said to be a massacre. After continuous bombing day and night, the capital of Yugoslavia has become a desolate scene. Yugoslav fighter planes shot down 18 German bombers over the capital of Yugoslavia. The capital of Yugoslavia was not equipped with anti-aircraft guns, so soldiers held rifles and shot into the air. When the reporter left the city, he met Yugoslav troops setting off to the front, as they had just heard the alarm that German troops were advancing deep. At the beginning of the German armored units' advance, there were 700 tanks, but 200 had been lost when they invaded. The people in all parts of Yugoslavia are very patriotic. Three days before the start of the war, they had received a "notice to defend their homes to the death and not to try to escape." They did not flee temporarily, so there was no panic. Although the German army swept the villages with machine guns along the way, it failed to drive them away. (18th Reuters dispatch)

### The British Warship "George" Has Powerful Strength; Worthy of Being Called Unparalleled in the World

London: A Reuters special correspondent said that the British warship "George V" is the newest and largest warship in Britain. The reporter was the first person to be allowed to board the ship. Here are some of the characteristics of the ship that I saw. The most powerful of all war tools created by mankind may be this ship. Its steel armor against bombs, shells, torpedoes, and mines, and the number of artillery, are unparalleled in the world. It is not wrong to call it a floating fortress. The reporter spent more than a day exploring the ship's various secret equipment. One of the equipment can be called "Churchill's secret weapon," as Churchill authorized its construction when he was Secretary of the Admiralty. Apart from that, I cannot say more. The first thing that catches the eye when boarding the ship is the extraordinary thickness of the steel plates, which is estimated to be 16 inches informally. Once on deck, you can see the turret with four 14-inch giant guns, the exterior of which is as large as an ordinary single-story house. The ship has 10 14-inch giant guns, several rows of 5.25 high-angle guns on both sides, a total of 16, and even more pom-pom guns. If a plane tries to attack the ship from the air, it is tantamount to suicide. It is heard that the machinery controlling the firepower of the ship is quite expensive, accounting for more than 200,000 pounds in the total construction cost of the ship. If the bridge is hit and cannot be used, the ship can still fight, because there are at least four places on the ship that can still command the advance and retreat. The biggest feature inside is that all parts are separated by waterproof partitions, so the ship has no danger of sinking. The ship is equipped with a total of 1,200 telephones to communicate messages and a total of 60,000 electric lights, making the interior extremely bright. In short, the features of the entire ship are too numerous to mention. The crew also has a variety of modern equipment in terms of living and sports, which is quite comfortable.

### British Forces in North Africa Actively Reinforced; Preparing a Counterattack on Sollum; Navy Assisting Land and Air Operations; The Siege of Tobruk is Not Yet Resolved

Cairo: As things stand, the German offensive in Libya seems to have temporarily stalled. The enemy has now adopted defensive actions in both Sollum and Tobruk. However, it is difficult to determine at this time whether the enemy has felt unable to continue advancing. (18th Reuters dispatch)

London: The Libyan battlefield also seems somewhat ambiguous, but there are several bright features at present, one of which is the arrival of the British Navy. The presence of the Navy on the battlefield is an important factor in every decisive battle. The British ship's shelling of Sollum and Gazala seems to have been very effective. A recent Italian convoy was completely annihilated. The Libyan enemy urgently needs supplies, forcing Italy to take the risks it has always avoided, but it has ultimately failed to reach its destination. British forces are now counterattacking in the Sollum area, indicating that the British are now able to call on more troops to begin a counterattack. German troops in Libya, after advancing from Benghazi to Bardia, need to rest and store supplies and materials before they can launch the same fierce attack as when they attacked El Agheila. However, with the British holding air superiority, the German task is more difficult and costly. If the British garrison in Tobruk resolutely holds on, it can make the German vanguard restless. (18th Reuters dispatch)

Capital of Switzerland: A report quoting Rome said that German and Italian Allied tank units are stepping up their encirclement of Tobruk Port. The British garrison has launched repeated counterattacks, but they have been repelled. (18th Havas dispatch)

London: Cairo officials announced that although the British army's breaking through the Italian army's position on Wednesday in Tobruk cannot be regarded as a major battle, the German attack has been repelled and the Italian army's position has been broken, which is enough to refute the Axis claims that the British army in Tobruk is isolated. British planes continued to attack enemy mechanized units and airfields in the Cyrenaica region on Tuesday night and Wednesday. A convoy of enemy motorized troops near Fort Capuzzo was attacked and many vehicles were destroyed. British fighter planes continued their aggressive patrols. In Abyssinia, British planes attacked the Tafari airfield on Wednesday, and South African planes also bombed and strafed enemy troops in the Udara area. The British Air Force has also been constantly attacking enemy supply convoys in Greece, inflicting heavy damage. Railway stations and airfields were also bombed and set on fire. On Wednesday, a large number of enemy planes raided ships in the port of Chalcis. British fighter planes took off to intercept them. Anti-aircraft guns shot down a German twin-engine dive bomber. (18th Reuters dispatch)

Cairo: A communique stated that on Wednesday night, the British Air Force and Naval Air Arm fiercely bombed Tripoli, the main base of the German and Italian forces in Libya, targeting ships and port facilities. A medium-sized oil tanker was hit and burned for more than an hour. Other roads and seawalls were also heavily bombed, and the city end was also hit and a big fire broke out. British planes also strafed searchlight teams, and all returned safely after completing their mission. (18th Reuters dispatch)

The German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, is also currently in Germany to report. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)

Istanbul – This morning, newspapers commented on the Greek war, saying that the outcome of the war would not affect the overall situation in the European war, and Turkey should avoid getting involved in the war vortex. The "Dan Bao" stated that after the end of the Balkan war, Germany will reorganize the European political economy and establish a European alliance, and then continue to wage a long-term war outside of Europe, so the final battle of the Second World War has not yet begun. "Fa Dan Bao" stated that Turkey sincerely advocated the establishment of a Balkan group as a bulwark against German aggression, but unfortunately some countries lacked enthusiasm, so this bulwark eventually vanished. At this moment, if the war affects our country, we should rise up to defend ourselves, but we never want to provoke in advance, because defending the gateway to the Near East is much more important than being in a decisive battlefield. (Havas, 18th)

### British Air Force Retaliates, Fiercely Raids the Center of Berlin, Drops the Latest Giant Bombs, Many Government Agencies Damaged

London – Last night, the center of Berlin suffered the most significant bombing since the war began. British aircraft flew over the area and dropped several of the latest heavy bombs that Britain had not used before. According to an Air Ministry communique, several fires broke out immediately after the British aircraft began bombing. Targets in the center of Berlin were hit and exploded. The intensity of the bombing was unprecedented in Berlin, and the damage was quite serious. According to Home Secretary Morrison, several British new "Stirling" bombers participated in the raid last night. We are not like the Nazis who use retaliation as an excuse. We have a pre-planned plan that will be implemented one by one. The bombing of Berlin is based on this plan. Hitler should know that we have all the rights to bomb Berlin and will not give in to Hitler's bombing of London. According to Morrison, the "Stirling four-engine bomber" he mentioned is one of the largest bombers in the world. It can carry a large number of bombs, has a high speed, and has a large range. This new type of bomb dropped by British aircraft was once used in the recent air raid on Emden, and its explosive power is five times greater than that used by the British Air Force before. The German side has tried to conceal the damage caused by the British Air Force's recent air raid on Berlin, but the extent of the bombed area can be seen in the films taken by British reconnaissance planes. Stations and factories on the outskirts of Berlin have all been bombed by aircraft. There are a large number of bomb craters and destroyed houses near Olivo Square in the western district of Berlin. Many hits were also made in the center of the city. The headquarters of the German Propaganda Department's secret police and the buildings of the Aviation Ministry were damaged and are currently being repaired. A building on Albert Reich Street has been bombed and destroyed. (Reuters, 18th)

The flames were so huge that they could be seen outside the British coast. Our plane followed the silvery Thames River to London, first dropping small bombs, and then throwing giant bombs. The force was so great that it shook the air far away. A British night fighter suddenly chased after us, trying to attack our plane. We noticed it in advance, so we dodged it first. After flying for a long time, we escaped its pursuit near the British coast. (United Press, 18th)

Talks on the European War (46)

### A Panoramic View of the US Navy

Female Nurses Serve on Ships The US Pacific Fleet has a total of less than 200,000 officers and soldiers, but it includes 12 very important women. These women are all formal nurses registered with the government and serve on the US Navy hospital ship "Relief." On their white hats, there is a gold bullion stripe on a black beaver background. They perform the duties of officers and command the male enlisted soldiers in the naval medical team. The female nurses have an internship period of one and a half years at sea. During this period, they set sail with the ship when they encounter naval exercises. During the war, except for the red cross flag hoisted on the ship, they face all kinds of wartime dangers the same as any officer or soldier in the fleet.

The equipment of the hospital ship is quite complete in terms of medical care, just like a hospital on land. It has a large operating room, an X-ray room, a biochemical laboratory, a treatment room, a spacious sun deck, and five hundred comfortable beds.

The naval hospitals, including those at sea and on land, as well as research laboratories, have a total of 1,100 medical personnel, 500 nurses, and 6,500 medical service soldiers. The Navy often boasts that this equipment is of great benefit to the sailors. Each warship has at least one deputy pharmacist, and larger ships have several doctors and an operating room. Of the accidents that occur in the Navy, a quarter occur in the entire United States. Half of the deaths and one-third of the sick days occur during vacations on shore.

By any standard, the US Navy's air force is unmatched by any other country's navy in the world. The US aircraft carriers are of excellent construction and are unparalleled by other countries. The 1,812 aircraft, though small, are the most modern aircraft, but compared to the air forces of other powers, these aircraft can still be invincible. There are currently six aircraft carriers in service, four under construction, and eight more planned to be built. By 1944, the United States will be able to own 18 aircraft carriers. Although the number of aviation pilots does not seem to be very sufficient, it is expected that there will be 22,000 aviation pilots by 1943, and 140,000 people serving on land to manage the maritime air force of 15,000 aircraft. US Air Force pilots are trained in Pensacola and are the best aviators in the world. US aircraft take off from aircraft carriers or land on the deck in the air three times faster than the maritime air forces of other countries.

A modern navy cannot fight at sea without the help of aircraft, and its role is to increase the reconnaissance and attack capabilities of the fleet. When engaging the enemy, the air force seizes and flies in front of the main fleet in combat, using reconnaissance planes and bombers to report enemy military information and to attack enemy fighters in order to gain control of the air. Gaining control in the air is as important as at sea or on the ground. For example, if the enemy's naval power is the same as that of the United States, but it lacks a superior maritime air force, then victory belongs to the United States.

The US maritime air force is not an independent army like the British "Royal Air Force," but a part of the Navy. Therefore, training and command are all presided over by the Navy. US naval personnel are now well aware that if they want to gain hegemony at sea, they must have a mighty air force. Therefore, they are making great efforts to expand the maritime air force. Now, the various elite aircraft of the US maritime air force are introduced as follows:

Patrol Bombers These are the eyes of the fleet, departing from naval bases on the coast and flying extremely long distances, becoming the fleet's farthest vanguard. The most notable of these is the "Consolidated PBY" flying boat, weighing 15 tons, with a range of over 4,000 miles and a speed of 180 miles per hour. The aircraft can carry two tons of bombs and has the combat function of a bomber when engaging enemy aircraft.

Torpedo Bombers Can carry one giant torpedo or several bombs. When launching a torpedo, the fuselage is first flown a few yards above the water, and then the entire aircraft is aimed at the target to release the torpedo. The Douglas TBD has a speed of 200 miles per hour and a range of 1,000 miles. (To be continued)

Negotiations Completed, Resumption of Classes Scheduled

At 5:00 pm yesterday, relevant parties again sent personnel to mediate and earnestly persuaded them to put the students' studies first and resume classes first. After negotiations between the representatives of the school and the teachers' representatives Dai Lizhi and Tang Ziyi, both parties believed that the exhortations of the superiors should be followed, so the negotiations quickly came to a successful conclusion. A storm has been resolved satisfactorily. The faculty and staff have scheduled to resume classes next Monday.

### The First Difficult School Teachers and Staff Announce School Building Dispute

(Dahua News Agency) The teachers and staff of the First Difficult Children's School invited the press to the Xiaohua Alumni Association at 2 p.m. on the 18th to report on the school building dispute. The teachers and staff of the school who participated were Chen Weishen, Zhang Shaozhai, Zhu Yifu, Wen Mushan, Jin Cheng, Sha Zhifang, Jiang Ronghua, Weng Huazhen, Xie Guoying, and nine others. According to Dahua News Agency reporters, Chen Weishen first reported the situation, followed by the former principal Xu Zichang expressing his views. The details are specially recorded below:

Chen Weishen Recounts the Case

According to Mr. Chen's report: (1) "School History" The school was within the No. 1 Reception Center on Dunxin Road, and preparations began in February of the 18th year, and school started in March. Mr. Xu Zichang was hired as principal. In the 29th year, Mr. Xu took office. All the principal's positions were concurrently held by Mr. Chen Xianmo, the director of the Education Department of this association. (2) "Teaching Overview" The school originally had more than 800 students, which then increased to 3,000. The number of teachers increased from more than 10 to 42, and the number of classes increased from more than 10 to 55. There are junior high school, elementary school, and kindergarten departments. All facilities are implemented in accordance with the standards promulgated by the Ministry, and in accordance with the actual needs of the children, emphasis is placed on four types of training: 1. Exercising a healthy physique, 2. Developing good habits, 3. Cultivating service ability, 4. Enhancing basic knowledge and skills. (3) "Reasons for Suspension of Classes" In mid-November of last year, due to oppression, the need to change books and registration issues, the suspension of classes was implemented on November 28. On December 2, we received an order from this association to move the 600 junior high school and upper grades students to the Yanping Road Refugee Temporary Residence. Ten teachers remained temporarily (currently only nine because one person has resigned). (4) "Negotiation Process" After the suspension of classes and relocation, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Secretary-General of this association, Mr. Xi Yushu, Chairman of the Education Committee, and Mr. Chen Xianmo, the principal of this school, searched for a school site and contacted the Cilian General Association to provide land in the vacant land of the Ci Yuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road, which is sponsored by the association, for the school to build a school building. The Cilian authorities were indecisive and hesitant. Therefore, on March 31, this association moved 500 students from this school who were residing in the Yanping Road Refugee Temporary Residence (junior high school students had entered the Association's Xiejizhong School at the beginning of the semester) to the Ci Yuan Shelter. Unexpectedly, after the students entered the Ci Yuan Shelter, the authorities of the association refused the school's relocation. (5) "Comrades' Position" There are rumors outside that the school is returning to the original school site on Dunxin Road to prepare for resumption of classes. These are all unfounded rumors. It must be known that the comrades were forced to move and obeyed orders. How can they return now? Therefore, they still reside in the Yanping Road Refugee Temporary Residence. (6) "Glimpses of Public Opinion, After parents questioned the comrades and the comrades responded publicly, fair-minded people in the society made righteous calls and expressed their grievances, and some advocated joint operation with the Cilian General Association. (7) "Request for Assistance" This decision was made by the school to move due to coercion. How should people in the society give deep sympathy and close help? Now the Cilian authorities are using the children as tools and taking the opportunity to eliminate this school invisibly. I request people in the society to make fair criticisms. In short, education is a social undertaking, and difficult education is a charitable undertaking. Moreover, all the supplies for the various shelters affiliated with the association are provided by this association. Now, the first difficult school of this association has no school building for a while, and is asking to borrow a place from it. This is a beneficial and inexpensive move, but the association is stingy and does not give it. Such disregard for the overall situation seems to run counter to the word "charity." I think the association has a Ci Yuan Elementary School, and it is using this opportunity to swallow the school.

Former Principal Speaks

Former Principal Xu Zimei said, "I have resigned from my position at the First Difficult School for a long time. I lack a deep understanding of the current evolution of the First Difficult School and the measures taken by the authorities, and I have no good opinions to contribute. However, the current handling of the students and teachers of the school seems inappropriate. In terms of the financial resources of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, it seems to have enough resources to run a difficult children's school. Why does it rely on the Cilian General Association for shelter? The Cilian has sheltered hundreds of students, so why can't it accommodate these hard-working and loyal teachers? I hope that the relevant authorities will find a way to adjust it as soon as possible."

Study Seminar

### How to Study Chemistry (3)

— Wu Ruinian

(2) A Calm Spirit. Problems that are easy to understand can be understood in a short period of time. If you encounter hesitant and difficult problems, or problems with research value, you should not be afraid of trouble, and repeatedly study and discuss them until you reach a thorough understanding. You must never be discouraged when you encounter difficulties. Because chemistry is a mysterious science, it is not as simple as a magic trick. Difficulties are inevitable. For example, the famous "606" syphilis drug was completed after 606 experiments. The number of resolutions is not too small, and the time is not too long. However, there are countless problems that cannot be solved with more resolutions and longer time. Therefore, studying chemistry requires a calm spirit. A year ago, I heard that a student in the chemistry department of a certain university had a conflict with the professor because he could not produce an "Unknown" once, twice, or three times. Such students are not suitable for studying chemistry. If they are forced to study it, the effect they will receive in the future will not be great.

(3) A Laborious Physique. Hard work is a necessary condition for all scientific researchers, and it is most needed for chemistry. Other general sciences, regardless of whether there are results, can be brought to an end and continued tomorrow. Chemistry is not like that. For example, to make something, it must be kept at a certain temperature for 24 hours, 48 hours, or 96 hours. You must sit next to it to prevent the temperature from being too high or too low and causing different results. Therefore, Edison spent most of his life in the laboratory. Without a laborious physique, how can he do this?

(4) Correct Habits. Chemistry is a precise science, and a slight difference can lead to a great error. For example, placing cotton in a mixed solution of nitric acid and sulfuric acid often produces trinitrocellulose, tetranitrocellulose, mononitrocellulose, and dinitrocellulose due to the concentration, temperature, and time of the acid. Trinitrocellulose and tetranitrocellulose are called guncotton, which is the raw material for manufacturing strong explosives. Mononitrocellulose and dinitrocellulose are called collodion cotton, which is commonly used to manufacture rayon and celluloid. Although the raw materials are the same, the properties of the resulting substances are very different, and the uses are also different. For example, the reaction of iron cyanide and ferrous cyanide with acids is a normal chemical reaction and there is no danger. However, the reaction of cyanide with acids immediately produces hydrogen cyanide, which can poison people invisibly. Therefore, the casual and sloppy bad habits of our people are not suitable for studying chemistry. This is what we should first correct and develop correct habits.

(5) Agile Thinking. The contents of chemistry are complex and the scope is vast. It is not an easy science to learn. Organic chemistry alone has hundreds of thousands of substances. Every day, the world continues to invent more and more. Teachers cannot teach them all, and students cannot read them all. If you do not infer other things from one thing, you will not be able to see even a small part of it even if you spend your whole life.

### Recent Situation of the West Qing Volleyball Team

In the recent situation of the West Qing Volleyball Tournament, the Russian Overseas Chinese team in Group A has won four consecutive victories and ranks first. The West Qing Soviet ranks second and third. The Yinghua team always comes in last in every game. Although this group adopts a three-cycle system, judging from the strength of each team, Yinghua is probably destined to be the last. In the women's group, since the Jewish women's team defeated West Qing Hong, they are tied for first place with Minli with two wins each. Youxing, Huxing, and West Qing Hong have mixed wins and losses, and are following behind. The Giant and Peide teams in Group B are in a superior position. The situation of each group is as follows:

### China-West Cup Table Tennis Group A, Huayi Defeats Hualian, Women's Group Youth Women Forfeits to Sokor

In the China-West Cup table tennis match, Huayi played against Hualian in Group A at the Hualian Gymnasium the night before. Huayi only had four players to play because its main player Chuan Qifang participated in the Jingwu Cup knockout round. Hualian seized this opportunity, but ultimately failed due to Huayi's more average talent. After the score reached 7 to 8, Hualian suffered a crushing defeat. As a result, Huayi defeated Hualian 13 to 8. Its main player Zhang Ying was defeated by Hualian's newcomer Yu Cheng with a score of 21 to 18, which was quite difficult. In the women's group, the runner-up of the previous competition, the Youth Women's team, forfeited to Sokor. The Sokor team won without any effort. According to the strength of the Youth Women's team, it is not weak. In the previous competition, it played with a partial lineup, which led to the Jewish women's team's poisonous hand. If it could fight with its back to the wall in this competition, there would be no hope of winning. However, it actually forfeited, which gave the Jewish women's team a chance to win the championship. It is a pity. There will be two more games tonight.

### Tonight's Jingwu Cup Table Tennis, Round 10 Knockout Round

The tenth group knockout round of the Jingwu Cup individual table tennis tournament will be held at 7 p.m. tonight at the Jingwu Gymnasium. The six players in this group are all well-known athletes. Each person's strength is quite average. There will definitely be a fierce battle at that time. However, the highest hopes of winning the championship should be given to Jiu Feng Xi Shaoqun, Huayi Xue Xuchu, and Youbang Ye Ziqing. Gu Jinxiang, a good player in the Central Savings Association, also has a chance. It is unknown who will win. Tickets are two corners, limited to 100 people. Today is the last round of the knockout round. After that, a round-robin tournament will be held. The list of attendees tonight is as follows: Xi Shaoqun, Xue Xuchu, Ye Ganqing, Gu Jinxiang, Cheng Aixing, Sheng Risheng.

### Today's Shan Kun Cup Small Ball, Post Office Workers Replay Against Model Friends

Therefore, the Nantong team does not need to play today. The last two games in Group A, the Post Office Workers against the Model Friends, are the games that were not completed due to rain last week. There will definitely be a fierce battle this time. In Group B, the Lion Sound against the French Concession.

### Food: The Rice Market Indeed Has Underground Trading, Using the Already Established High Price as the New Price Limit; There is No Fundamental Solution, How Can It Not Be Destroyed?

The price of rice is soaring non-stop, and the price limit has long been broken. It is extremely difficult for ordinary people to live. The authorities have no fundamental solution and only know how to use the already established price as the new price limit. It is like closing the door after the thief has left, and declaring martial law after the theft. Knowing that it is ineffective. Indeed, yesterday there was underground trading and surcharges in the market. It was found that foreign rice was coming to Shanghai in abundance. Yesterday, the French company's Laos (Roas) ship arrived from Haiphong with 1,510 tons of foreign rice, totaling 15,300 bags. It arrived at the port yesterday morning and berthed at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf for unloading. The Taikoo company's Qingyuan ship transported 11,804 bags of foreign rice from Siam and berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is heard that a large amount of foreign rice will be shipped here next week. Therefore, I don't know what the purpose of the hoarders is for the endless rise in rice prices. It is obviously borrowing a knife to kill ordinary people. (Zu)

Yesterday was only the second day of the foreign rice price limit, and underground surcharges have already emerged. Xiaowen's original package was 146 yuan per white bag, with a surcharge of 200 yuan to 250 yuan. Saigon Yinghua's price was 141 yuan, with a surcharge of 100 yuan to 150 yuan. There is no surcharge for broken rice for new orders. More than 3,000 tons of new orders sold by Taifeng and Heyifu have been sold at prices ranging from 115 yuan 7 jiao and 122 yuan 4 jiao to 123 yuan 2 jiao. Therefore, the returned original package still opened at 116 yuan. There are many other orders in negotiation, and they arrive endlessly. There is more digestion and less reality. Therefore, the stock bottoms of each warehouse have been investigated and added by 100,000 to 200,000 bags. The warehouse stock is estimated to reach 1,055,707 bags. The number of shops, factories, households, and warehouses outside the warehouse stock is also huge. Special speculation helps to activate the city. The market manipulators use the bank turmoil and various rumors to instigate the price increase. Shops in the mainland townships have inquired about it, but the actual sales are less than 1,000 bags. However, it is said that the Shanghai gang has handled no less than 100,000 bags, so there is this underground surcharge. If the price limit is broken before the end of the day, how will we face the citizens?

After the limited price for thick glutinous rice and other national rice, the sales in this hometown shop have been stagnant. However, most cargo owners have no intention of selling urgently and are still trying to hold on. Therefore, although the sales path is slightly smooth, the price of thick glutinous rice can stand firm, but thin rice is light and weak. It seems difficult to last long in this sultry weather, and it has depreciated by half a yuan. The price of Qingjiao Hujian thin rice is 117 yuan and a half to 117 yuan. The supply and demand of glutinous rice are similar, and the market has not risen or fallen, showing a stable situation. Only glutinous green beans are not subject to the limited price, and the sales path is strong. The selling price has soared, and special goods have been opened up to 111 yuan, which is about to drive with glutinous rice. This is truly an unexpected strange phenomenon.

### Flour Market Quiet

Yesterday's foreign flour trading was virtually stagnant. Because the Miscellaneous Grain Association was ordered by the authorities to ban illegal transactions and enforce price limits, the supervision was very strict. Therefore, there is no formal transaction of existing flour. Only a small number of people still negotiated directly with customers outside the market. The price of Golden Dragon brand was 29 yuan 7-8 jiao, and the price of Huadao brand Australian flour was 30 yuan 045 jiao. There was no major change. The market was quite quiet. The sales of wheat were generally deserted, and there was no formal transaction.

### Oilseed Cake Market Situation Has Not Been Clarified

Yesterday, the miscellaneous grain and oilseed cake market was the second day after the price limit. Because people were anxious and the situation had not been clarified, various gangs did not dare to handle actual sales transactions, resulting in few transactions. 100 bags of Jiaozhou beans, 250 bags of Tianjin beans, 3 cars of Mingguang red grains, 300 bags of Saigon corn, 400 bags of Dutch corn, 150 bags of raw peanuts, and 6,000 pieces of bean cake were sold. The market price stood guard on the limited price, but its potential trend did not loosen. Because various products are not standardized and the quality is high and low, the price difference is quite large, and the industry association is afraid that disputes will arise in terms of price limits. Therefore, it held a meeting yesterday to refer to the market conditions opened on the 16th, deliberate and stipulate, and then publicly announce the market situation. The oil category stipulates that Jiaozhou raw oil is 119 yuan, Yantai listening raw oil is 160 yuan, Yantai soybean oil is 103 yuan, and Dayou factory oil is 114 yuan. The bean category is determined to be a medium price. High-quality goods are added by 2 yuan according to the fixed price. Tianjin beans are 48 yuan and a half, Qingdao beans are 46 yuan and a half, and Guide beans are 44 yuan. The high-quality red grains are set at 34 yuan and 5 jiao, and the medium price is lowered accordingly. The corn of the Saigon Yinghua Company is a regular sale of spot goods, and the new Saigon goods are set at 37 yuan, the old goods are 34 yuan, the Dutch white corn is 34 yuan, and the yellow corn is 37 yuan. Today, 30 bags of beans are shipped to Hong Kong.

### Finance: U.S. and British Exchange Rates Fall Sharply Again; Local U.S. and British Stable

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC listed prices for each exchange rate were unchanged. In the morning market, the U.S. and British exchange rates slightly eased and then returned to the same level. It was because Chinese and British banks had a slight intention to supply after the morning opening, which resulted in the U.S. exchange rate of 5 yuan 25 kexie and the British gold of 3 ban shi 21875 kexie this month. However, Chinese speculators followed up one after another, so the loose trend soon returned to the same level. The afternoon price was even more stable, and no transaction was heard. The final British gold was 3 ban shi 203125 and the U.S. dollar was 5 yuan 21875, which was the same as the closing price of the previous day. The transaction was sparse that day. It was said that the China Communications Bank would resume business, and it would not be decided until next Monday. Speculators did not dare to bet lightly.

Foreign Businesses Have Some Supply

Since the morning foreign telegram silver market, British, American, and Indian exchange rates have been unified and changed. The U.S. exchange rate against the British pound has fallen sharply by 75, and the U.S. exchange rate against Shanghai has fallen by 6 cents. The rest have not changed. At the early opening of the domestic market, the bank selling price for spot goods was British gold 2 ban shi 203125 and the U.S. dollar 5 yuan 21875, which were the same as the closing price of the previous day.

### Cash Transactions Are Rare; Futures Re-enter the Market

Yesterday, the gold market's open trading and underground market re-entered the market. It once again retreated close to the 6,600 yuan mark. It turned from weak to strong, and then fell again. People's hearts in all directions temporarily turned firm. They were expecting the China Communications Bank to resume business next Monday. Because the foreign exchange rate eased and then returned to the same level, the securities firms, gold firms, and bill merchants sold to the former Shanghai gang, Guangdong gang, and a certain money shop, and then bought vigorously. The price dropped to 6,605 yuan and once jumped to 6,670 yuan. However, the U.S. dollar next month was still 5 yuan 21875 and was not tight, which forced it closer to the settlement price. The previous sellers became active again, and the price fell again at noon. The afternoon fluctuations were even narrower, fluctuating around 6,630 yuan, and finally the open trading was reduced by a small 4 yuan. The total transaction was 20,000 taels.

Yida sold 30 taels to a certain silver shop at a price 160 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Yongcheng and Wanfeng each sold 50 taels to the silver shop industry at a price 160 yuan higher, a premium of ten yuan. The ornamental gold's exchange rate was bullish, still at 700 yuan.

The Open Trading's Decline Was Very Small

Since the market opened at 9:15 a.m., the price was 6,630 yuan, which was 7 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. Retail investors and silver houses pushed up the price to 6,640 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that the U.S. dollar could be settled at 5 yuan 25. Chengji, Yida, Xinyuan, Dafeng, and others successively sold off, and the price gradually fell by 35 yuan to a low price of 6,605 yuan. Jin Hao, Deda, Hengji, and Shunyuan absorbed the low price, and it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had returned to the same level, and retail investors also came to compete for the price, which gradually rose to 6,670 yuan. At noon, Xinfengyong, Chengji, and Tong Kangyong sold off, and Deda also sold off again, suppressing the price to 6,636 yuan. The noon closing was 6,627 yuan.

The former rose to 2 yuan 04 fen, and the latter rose to 1 yuan 7 jiao 7 fen.

### Securities: Bond Market Tired and Unable to Rise

The public debt underground market was still tired and unable to rise yesterday. In the current environment of endless rumors, based on the weakness of people's hearts, it is particularly difficult to rise. In addition, the four banks have still not opened, and many parties do not dare to boost their courage. The short sellers are unwilling to make up for this environmental situation, so the market is tending to hover. Yesterday's trading still did not improve. All parties' entry and exit were slack. In the morning, Tong Kang and Da Tong had a slight purchase, and Xie Xingyuan, Lian Yi, and Hong Da had a sale. Although the market moved frequently, the rise and fall were extremely small. In the afternoon, No. 16 bought Type C, the market was slightly higher by 1 jiao, Xinfu bought, still based on its consistent purpose, and Sankai and Lian Yi sold. The market was stable.

London, 17th (Thursday) Telegram, today's listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt and stocks of British companies far away were all flat and stagnant. The market situation did not rise or fall.

### Zha Hua Kangsha and Two Companies Distribute Final Dividends

The final dividend for 1940 is 5 jiao of national currency per share, plus an interim dividend of 2 jiao and a half, for a total of 7 jiao and a half per year.

### Yarn and Cloth: Chips Abundant and Double Horse Short Sellers Active

The yarn market has entered a meandering state. This is because after the big rise, it has caused a part of the profit-takers to sell off. At the same time, the foreign exchange rate is calm and the gold price is stable, which allows people's hearts to be stable. Moreover, because of the abundance of double horse chips, the short sellers are still selling and adding to their positions. As for the long side, because the raw materials are high, the Hong Kong gang's purchase of existing yarn is still considered weak, and the demand for cloth is strong. The future looks good compared to the low price of yarn. However, there is no shortage of 20-count yarn on hand, and the factory is willing to compromise. The short sellers are very active, so the market situation is still in a meandering state. The high price of 20-count double horse is 1,530 yuan, and the low price is 1,509 yuan. The initial transaction in the afternoon was 1,518 yuan, which fell to 1,512 yuan, and then rose to 1,517 yuan. The final price was 1,514 yuan. Today, 2,060 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The morning opening of Double Horse was still enthusiastic. The first price was 1,530 yuan. However, as soon as this price opened, the sellers were quite enthusiastic, and the market fell sharply, falling to 1,511 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that the gold price was flat, and the long side regained its purchasing power. However, the short-selling pressure was still strong, and the price gradually rose back to 1,510 yuan. At this time, the situation on the stage was still in a flat state, and then returned slightly to 1,512 yuan. After that, it was heard that the gold price had turned higher, and the buying interest was steep, and the price rose sharply to 1,526 yuan. However, near the closing, the price softened again to 1,517 yuan and a half. According to the statistics of transactions in the first half of the day, 7,910 packages were sold. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 900 Ningbo 10

Same Trade 7,000 Statistics 7,910

### Cotton Market Still Very Firm, Transactions Slightly Reduced

The current cotton situation continues to be good, and recently, the demand from Chinese factories has shown a positive trend. At the same time, cotton merchants' sentiments are unanimously upward. However, the arrival of Indian cotton recently has been very strong, but prices remain high. Also, those who hoard cotton are more active, so the cotton market is very solid. Cotton merchants are still optimistic about the future. Yesterday, inter-dealer and factory transactions totaled 2,750 pieces and 377 bales, with prices falling by 2-3 yuan. The market prices are recorded on the left.

Another report: Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai is active, with a strong upward trend. Because various situations favor the bulls, traders are vying to buy. At the same time, factories are also taking the opportunity to replenish raw cotton and are unwilling to lag behind. Therefore, the sellers continue to raise prices under the competition in recent days, and the market continues to advance. Yesterday, Wing On still purchased a large amount of Indian cotton, with transactions reaching about 1,000 bales.

The New York cotton market: Buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the market is sluggish and lacks characteristics. Yesterday's closing price was down 1-2 points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market: Initially, it fell due to the massive liquidation by bulls and a sharp decline in stocks. But soon, it was suppressed by yarn mills buying. Later, it fell again due to retail investors liquidating. Traders bought again, and buyers continued to support it, resulting in the closing price rising by 2 to 9 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market will be very flat, only looking slightly lower by half a rupee.

### Piece Goods: Actual Sales Stagnant, Cotton Cloth Offerings Mediocre

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market was stable, with the asking prices for various cloths showing mixed trends. Because the cloth prices are in a swirling state, hoarders are watching, and it depends on actual sales for a shift. White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill have fallen back by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. 16-pound coarse cloth and coarse twill are the firmest, with each brand rising by another 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. Tongyi Factory opened a May futures contract for more than 100 bales of 16-pound colored butterfly coarse cloth at a price of 51 yuan. Prices for 9-pound to 14-pound [cloth] changed. The labor unrest at Yangshupu Factory has not yet been resolved, and various brands of coarse cloth from the factory cannot be picked up. Demand for spot goods is strong. Transactions on this street were over 500 pieces for various cloths. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian compradores transacted several hundred pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and coarse cloth. Zhejiang, Fujian, and northern compradores only made scattered transactions. In addition, today (the 19th), there are 1,675 pieces of cotton cloth being shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: Because actual sales are stagnant, market sentiment has turned weak. White goods and fine cloth have fallen back by 2-3 jiao per piece. Longtou current godown receipt closed in the afternoon at 52 yuan 3 jiao. Sijun Qian Bijige was 1 yuan 5 jiao 7 fen, also down 1 fen 25.

### Sugar Market: Term White Approaching 100 Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market was initially flat for coarse white sugar, then tightened, with the result being no increase or decrease. However, term deliveries continued to rise strongly. The association quoted spot prices as 91 yuan 7 jiao for 24 coarse white sugar from foreign godowns. April 10th term futures were 11 yuan 4 jiao, 5 jiao, 5 jiao 5 fen, 6 jiao, 7 jiao. End of April term was 92 yuan 4 jiao, 5 jiao, 3 jiao, 2 yuan, 1 yuan 9 jiao, 2 yuan, 2 yuan 2 jiao, 4 jiao, 1 jiao 5 fen, 5 jiao, 4 jiao. All were without significant changes. Taikoo’s term white B mark West godown spot price was 98 yuan 5 jiao, End of April term 98 to 99 yuan. DY mark West godown 91 yuan 4 jiao. HX mark West godown 90 yuan 5 jiao, East godown 90 yuan, all up 1 yuan 5 jiao each. Father sugar: 250 bags arrived from Hong Kong on the 18th.

### North-South Goods: Tianjin Peaches Highly Priced

The removal of walnut kernels has been quiet for a long time, but has recently started to move slightly. Tianjin masters selected and offered more than 300 packages of peaches at a price of 100 yuan, all of which were taken by Hong Kong compradores. Because direct shipment from Tianjin to Hong Kong is not cost-effective, the prices offered by Shanghai compradores are for goods that were handled earlier, so the prices are more suitable, catering to the tastes of Hong Kong. According to people in the industry, it would cost 120-130 yuan to ship from Tianjin to Shanghai at the current Tianjin price. If Hong Kong's demand continues to move, prices will inevitably rise.

Miscellaneous peaches such as Hao peaches and Southern peaches are being handled by the Suzhou and Hangzhou gangs, and the momentum is also rising. High Hao peaches are quoted at 65 yuan, and Southern peaches are quoted at 70 yuan, 5 yuan better than before. Haozhou offered more than 200 packages at a price of 63 yuan. Negotiations are still underway with customers for Tongnan peaches, and transactions will be made soon.

### Silk and Tea: Chun Mee Green Tea, Tianjin Gang Scouring

The Tianjin tea buying agency in Shanghai has recently been vigorously scouring for Zhen Mei green tea produced and sold by foreign firms. It is said that core-extracted Zhen Mei is the item with the largest sales. In the past week, more than 4,000 boxes have been traded. The selling price of core-extracted Zhen Mei ranges from 256 to 320 yuan, and the selling price of Tong Zhen Mei ranges from 178 to 250 yuan. Prices have risen sharply by 10 to 20 yuan. Because the current market price of raw tea has reached its peak due to extremely high freight rates and various transportation obstacles. Therefore, the Tianjin gang has changed to buying this foreign firm's tea, and it is expected that future sales will continue to expand.

### Miscellaneous: Cigarettes Looking Up, Future Bleak

The dark market for cigarettes: the buying price is gradually falling back. Hoarders' hopes of rising prices are bleak. They are selling off one after another and seeking other developments. There is a chorus of selling. Customer sales cannot be shipped, and trading among traders is cold, resulting in a weak market price. Yesterday's market price was 1,300 yuan for brands like Great Britain, discounted by 10 yuan from the current market price. Laodao brand was 920 yuan, Pinhai brand was 868 yuan, Wuhua brand was 665 yuan, Xiaoxiannv brand was 663 yuan, Huacheng Xiaomeili brand, medium box was 455 yuan, 10-piece Dàqiánmén brand was 386 yuan per 10,000 pieces, more than 20 yuan less than before, 50-piece Dàqiánmén brand was 366 yuan per 10,000 [pieces].

### Coal: Large Batch of Hongji Coal Arrived

--Market Prices Inconsistent--

Hongji White Coal: After various parties dredged channels, a large batch of new goods has reportedly arrived in port in recent days. The spot market is now full. Managers and merchants have also begun spot sales. However, market prices are inconsistent. The highest is 395 yuan, and a certain company only offers 370 yuan, but there are quantity restrictions. Retail prices on this street have fallen slightly. Sifted lumps are 420 yuan per ton, delivered to customers, including cartage.

### A Letter Buying Coal Balls

Dear Editor,

I am writing to you because prices have soared recently, and people are struggling to make a living. The most important food and coal balls are now being manipulated by a group of unscrupulous profit-seekers who are deliberately squeezing the people's wealth. Their methods are so vicious that they are appalling. There is one thing I cannot help but say, and I respectfully present it to the public and ask you to use your esteemed newspaper as a place to warn readers, so that they can learn from previous mistakes. Since August 13th, I have always purchased coal balls for daily use from a large coal factory on Rue Loushenfu [Avenue Dubail], and there have been no errors in ordering by sending someone or calling. However, since the strike wave occurred, these coal merchants have disregarded their credit and have again used their tricks. They send deliveries of ordered goods depending on whether prices are rising or falling. I called on March 14th to order two loads of coal balls (when the price was 10 yuan per load) and begged them to deliver as soon as possible. The person on the phone replied that it would not be possible until after the 10th. Extending to the 27th, I sent someone to inquire (when the price had risen to 12 yuan per load), but the factory staff replied that there was no phone order, looking smug and self-important. I thought that the person on the phone had made a mistake, and I could only admit my bad luck. A few days later, I sent a maid to order again (when the price was 12 yuan 5 jiao per load), thinking that there would be no more mistakes, but it was not delivered for a long time. I inquired on the 8th of this month, and the answer was the same as before (the price was now 16 yuan per load). If it was not deliberate deception, how could the answers for one order be the same two times? This is because coal merchants are scheming to profit, delivering when prices are low and refusing to deliver when prices are high, and thus achieving their goal of manipulating and profiting. They completely disregard commercial credit, which is truly hateful. I am writing to your esteemed newspaper to ask you to reveal this, so that readers can be aware of it and avoid being deceived. With best wishes, Wang Hequn, April 17th.

### China Receives New Weapons, Future of War More Favorable, Assistance Obtained Early Due to Soviet-Japanese Agreement, Chinese Army's Bravery Known Worldwide

The Dalu Newspaper commented that Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih and President of the Bank of China Song Ziwen stated in Washington that President Roosevelt has agreed to take actions to assist China. President Roosevelt himself also announced that the US authorities are planning to provide material assistance to China under the Lend-Lease Act. This action by Washington is one of the results of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact signed in Moscow a few days ago. In addition, US Secretary of the Navy Knox's statement on Wednesday that "We are now at the decisive stage of the current world war" is also a result of the Soviet-Japanese agreement. The current world situation has begun to clear up, which is beneficial and harmless to China. China's long-standing weakness in national defense has been the lack of material tools for modern warfare. The whole world now knows the bravery of Chinese soldiers in combat, and those who have "experienced it firsthand," such as Japan, know it even better. If these soldiers can obtain modern new weapons, victory can be assured.

Soviet-Japanese Agreement Not of Great Importance

Mr. Moray of the Information Office of the British Embassy in Shanghai, in a broadcast on XCDN radio last night about current events of the week, mentioned the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact and said that its importance cannot be predicted at this time. However, this move by the Kremlin is an expression of opposition to German aggression in the Balkans. If a war breaks out between Germany and the Soviet Union, Japan will not be able to attack the Soviet Union from behind. It is also noteworthy that the agreement does not mention the issue of aiding China. The "New Order" claimed by the Axis powers is merely a name, and they are actually destroying order. President Roosevelt also said that the term "New Order" is neither new nor orderly, but merely a mask for the Axis powers.

### Four Banks Adjusting Interbank Finance, Market Tends to Stabilize, Authorities Exerting Efforts to Protect Four Banks' Resumption of Business, Black Market Exchange Rate Stabilization Committee Continues to Maintain

The Shanghai branches and offices of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China telegraphed their head offices to request instructions after temporarily suspending business on April 17 due to the issue of guaranteeing the rights of the four banks’ employees. It is heard that the head offices of the four banks have followed the instructions of the Ministry of Finance and ordered the continuation of business to maintain Shanghai's finance. The Shanghai branches of the four banks will continue to handle the adjustment of interbank finance as before, so the entire financial situation in Shanghai remains stable. Speculative markets have quieted down, and people's hearts are somewhat at ease.

Adjusting Interbank Stabilizes Finance

After the Shanghai branches and offices of the four banks temporarily suspended business, they are allowed to continue adjusting interbank finance in order to maintain Shanghai's financial visibility. The members of the Silver and Money Trade Association were given assistance from the four banks’ adjustment to maintain Shanghai's finance, so that they would not experience insufficient turnover or difficulties in responding due to the four banks’ temporary suspension of business. Therefore, during the period of the four banks’ suspension, all government-run, joint government-private, and commercial banks, exchange houses, etc., opened for business as usual, and all businesses operated as usual. The entire financial situation remained stable, the money market's discount rate was flat, and money was abundant, with no signs of tension.

Rumors Quiet Down, People's Hearts Stabilize

The speculative markets in Shanghai, such as foreign exchange, gold, securities, and various commodity markets, have been flooded with Shanghai hot money. Speculators have been constantly causing trouble, either hoarding commodities or engaging in foreign exchange and gold speculation, or engaging in securities speculation, repeatedly engaging in blind activity in order to make profits. Since the Shanghai branches of the four banks temporarily suspended business, speculators stirred up trouble, causing slight fluctuations in the market. Recently, because the Black Market Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee continued to maintain operations, and friendly banks such as HSBC provided as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries, the black market exchange rate turned stable. Therefore, people's hearts in the market gradually calmed down, rumors subsided slightly, and speculators could not use their tricks.

Increase Patrolmen, Closely Protect

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that after the Shanghai branches of the four banks telegraphed their head offices to request instructions, the Ministry of Finance stated that the Shanghai branches of the government banks would continue to operate to maintain Shanghai's finance regardless of the circumstances. The head offices of the four banks have ordered them to continue operating, so the Shanghai branches of the four banks have persuaded their employees and planned proper protective measures. They will resume business in the short term. The authorities of the two concessions have promised to provide close protection for banks that serve the public within the concessions, and additional patrolmen will be stationed in front of the banks to ensure safety and prevent minor incidents from occurring.

Legal Exchange Rate Unchanged, Black Market Maintained

The settlement of the four banks’ bills will be handled on the day of resumption of business. The four banks’ bills at the bank note exchange will also be temporarily suspended during the period of the four banks’ suspension. Once business resumes, the exchange will be carried out as usual. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank temporarily suspended the hanging of the plaque for the legal exchange rate due to the temporary suspension of business, but the exchange rate has not changed. It is still 20 yuan for US dollars and 1 shilling and 2.5 pence for British pounds. HSBC continued to quote daily rates for the black market exchange rate and continued to maintain it in order to maintain the trade of legitimate merchants, and hoped that people from all walks of life would not be misled by rumors. The resumption of business of the four banks is imminent, and the suspension is temporary.

### British Economic Department Concerned About Far East Economy

According to the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom, the British Wartime Economic Department has set up a wartime economic delegation in Singapore in order to collect and adjust the economies and industries in various parts of the Far East, and ordered Mr. Kairaland to be responsible for handling all official affairs related to various parts of the Far East. Mr. Kai has traveled to China for many years and is very familiar with the situation in Shanghai and the coastal areas of China. It is heard that experienced personnel have been selected to go to places such as British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies to be responsible for searching for economic and industrial reports and materials.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Writes to Various Trade Associations to Stop Price Increases, Various Industries Will Meet to Discuss Suppression Measures

According to reliable sources, in order to curb rising prices, in addition to strictly instructing the Rice Market Management Committee and the Miscellaneous Flour Trade Association that the prices of various items must not exceed the prices of the 16th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Council has also sent similar notices to the Shanghai Coal Trade Association, the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Trade Association, and the Shanghai Flour Trade Association. After receiving the notice from the authorities, the aforementioned trade associations will each convene emergency meetings to discuss measures to suppress prices.

### Shanghai Rice Supply Sufficient, Miscellaneous Grains Prices Determined, Must Not Exceed Closing Market Prices of 16th

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association’s 106th to 107th inventory of rice was officially released yesterday. The total number of rice stored in various Chinese and foreign godowns this period was 1,055,767 bags, an increase of 200,657 bags compared to the previous period. Among them, Gonghexian and Shuntai had the most, with 138,58 [missing number] bags, Longmao ranked second with 121,125 bags, the Company ranked third with 107,260 bags, the Rice Bottle Fortune ranked fourth with 99,757 bags, Taikoo ranked fifth with 87,517 bags, and Xingye ranked sixth with 53,736 bags. The remaining godowns each had more than 10,000 bags of rice. The above-mentioned rice stored in various godowns does not include the rice sold in rice shops and hoarded by residents. According to estimates by the person in charge of the association, the number is also around 700,000 bags, so the total amount of rice stored in the city is more than 1.7 million bags, enough to meet the needs of the city's residents for half a year.

Rice Industry Held Joint Meeting Yesterday

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry and the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Trade Associations received an order from the Shanghai Municipal Council a few days ago, instructing them to immediately find ways to suppress the market price of miscellaneous grains. In order to comply with the intentions of the authorities and to suppress the selling price of miscellaneous grains, the two trade associations held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members of the two trade associations at 3 pm yesterday at the association's office at 15 Avenue Edward VII. More than 20 people attended, including Fu Qian'geng, Jiang Hongbin, Yang Heqing, She Bingwen, and Xing Zhigang (Chen Ziyi and Zhu Zixiang resigned due to illness, so they were not present). Jiang Hongbin was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, and then began the discussion of the case where the trade association was ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Council that the buying and selling of miscellaneous grains must not exceed the closing market price on April 16. It was resolved that the association had followed the order to not allow the buying and selling of miscellaneous grains to exceed the closing market price on April 16. In addition to complying with the order and making a public announcement, after reviewing and regulating the market conditions of various goods on that day, in the future, the buying and selling of various miscellaneous grains in the city market must be carried out in accordance with the above-mentioned regulations, and must not exceed the regulations, and a public announcement will be made to the market.

Detailed Regulations on Miscellaneous Grains Market Prices

The prices of miscellaneous grains assessed by the two trade associations yesterday are recorded as follows: Jiaozhou Lou oil 119 yuan (Southern regulations per hundred Shanghai catties), Yantai Tingsheng oil 160 yuan (Northern regulations per hundred Shanghai catties Sima scale), Yantai Lou bean oil 103 yuan (Southern regulations per hundred Shanghai catties), Dayou Factory bean oil 114 yuan (Shanghai scale Southern regulations), Tianjin Jinyuan beans (medium size) 48 yuan 5 jiao, Zaidao soybeans (medium size) 46 yuan 5 jiao, Guide soybeans (medium size) 44 yuan (per hundred Shanghai catties, when high-priced goods are opened, each high-priced good is added 2 yuan), Saigon Chen corn 37 yuan (per white Shanghai catty), Dutch yellow corn 27 yuan (per hundred Shanghai catties), Dutch white corn 34 yuan (per hundred Shanghai catties), Yinghua Si is in accordance with foreign firm regulations for buying and selling, high red shell, red sorghum, 34 yuan 5 jiao per hundred Shanghai catties, wheat no goods no market.

### French Concession Electricity Price Increase Approved by French Municipal Council, to Be Implemented After Approval by French Consul-General, Reduction in Current Consumption Plan to Be Announced Today

The English-language *China Press* reports that the French Concession Electricity Company previously submitted a request to the French Municipal Council for approval to increase electricity and power prices by a certain percentage. Without waiting for the official notification from the French Municipal Council, it is expected that once the matter is approved by the Municipal Council, electricity prices in the French Concession will be increased. It is learned that the French Electricity Company recently submitted a request to the French Municipal Council for approval to increase electricity prices by 40%, but the special committee of the French Municipal Council studying electricity and power issues only agreed to increase by 25%. The Municipal Council held a meeting on Tuesday (the 15th) and passed the resolution to increase electricity prices. It is now awaiting the final approval of the French Consul-General Majeli. It is also learned that the Municipal Council is currently drafting a plan to reduce current consumption within the French Concession. This plan has been scheduled to be announced tomorrow (the 19th). According to well-informed sources, because the general electricity users in the French Concession have not reduced their electricity consumption to date, showing that they are unwilling to cooperate with public utility agencies, the Municipal Council approved the electricity price increase after investigating the fuel [supply] problem.

### Zhu Changhai, Condition Still Serious

Zhu Changhai, a native of Yancheng, Jiangsu, the 36-year-old director of the composing room of the *China Press*, was ambushed on Chengdu Road near Avenue Haig at 5:30 pm the day before yesterday. He was shot in the back. Afterward, he was treated at the Juntushi Hospital by the police. It is learned that Zhu's condition is still serious because the bullet has not yet been removed.

### Pingliang Road Extension Plan Canceled

### German Paratrooper Instructor Came to Shanghai, Nazi Officials Denied, But Acknowledged Nazi Groups' Organizations, The Purpose is to Guide the Overseas Germans' Recreation

The Yulin report says that yesterday (April 17), both Chinese sources and rumors reported that German military officers, youth secret police and paratrooper instructors have come to the Far East and Shanghai to assist the Japanese technically. Nazi officials in Shanghai were incredulous about this, but acknowledged that a Nazi group named "Strength through Joy" is active in Hongkou. The group has no political motives.

Germany and Italy Help the Japanese Advance to the South

Over the past few weeks, Chinese newspapers in Shanghai have repeatedly reported that German and Italian officers have come to assist the Japanese. One report said that German and Italian military experts had gone to Hainan Island to assist the Japanese army there in their advance to the south. Although this is difficult to confirm in this city, well-informed Chinese people generally believe that this may have happened, as the European Axis powers promised this kind of assistance to Japan in the Tripartite Pact.

Overseas Germans Organize Groups in Shanghai

Yesterday, a newspaper reported that many German youths have recently arrived in Shanghai, some of whom are secret police and the rest are hired by the Japanese to train paratroopers in Shanghai. Regarding this, those close to the Nazis in this city denied it, but admitted that a German group named "Strength through Joy" has established a branch in Shanghai. It is said that the group guides the recreation of overseas Germans here on holidays and does not distribute Chinese leaflets. Before the outbreak of the European war, the group was very active among German workers on holidays.

Another Rumor That Paratrooper Instructors Come to Shanghai

The Dalu newspaper said that recently 300 Germans, all with "missions," came directly to the Far East from Berlin. Since last week, they have arrived in Shanghai one after another, causing suspicion among some people in the city. One said that these Germans are secret police, but one of them, after drinking in a bar one night, told people that he and his companions were paratrooper experts who came to Shanghai to teach Japanese soldiers how to practice this kind of tactic. Seeing that the Japanese have recently been practicing parachuting in the Jiangwan area, what the German said may not be false.

### Renji Hospital Board of Directors Annual Meeting Reports Economic Situation

Shanghai Renji Hospital is the most magnificent and well-equipped hospital for the poor in Shanghai. The hospital continues to operate thanks to donations from all walks of life. Yesterday, Friday, the board of directors of the hospital held its annual meeting. Chairman Pang Chenglian reported on the hospital's operations and economic situation over the past year. The general report was, according to the hospital's accounts, the actual savings last year were approximately 33,000 yuan. The London Missionary Society provided substantial economic assistance last year, which ended in September last year, so there was still ample room for expenses. The hospital has also substantially increased consultation fees. Therefore, the consultation fees have increased from 87,675 yuan to 331,149 yuan from 1926 to 1940. Outpatient work was reduced by about 24% last year. Since the outbreak of the European war, the special economic assistance from the London Missionary Society has ended. I believe that the hospital has done its best to reduce expenses, but it is not convenient to sacrifice all the facilities and equipment too much, and the scope of our work cannot be greatly reduced either. I have read important accounts of the British hospital work, and the income from consultation fees accounts for about 34%, 20% and 12% of the total income. However, in the case of this hospital, the income from consultation fees accounted for more than 46% of the total income last year, while the income from donations to the hospital only accounted for 20% of the total income. We really do not want to increase consultation fees again this year. However, according to the long-standing traditions and the psychology of the people of Shanghai, this hospital was the first to be established to help poor Chinese people. The people in charge of managing this hospital under the will of Mr. Lester have now felt the difficulty of allocating work according to the economic income. It is fortunate that the annual expenses do not exceed 900,000. Recently, it has become clear that poor people do not have enough food and clothing. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the gentlemen who helped raise 61,354 yuan last year. At the current prices, at least 200,000 yuan must be raised to meet our budget. I hope that all gentlemen and merchants will generously donate even greater sums of money to help us.

### The French Concession Subsidizes the Music Corps Expenses; The Municipal Council Sends a Letter of Thanks

The Municipal Council recently approved the allocation of 100 national currency by the French Concession authorities as maintenance funds for the music corps for this year and has sent a letter of thanks.

### Fire at Meihsing Factory

At 7:36 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out on the drying platform of the Meihsing Textile Factory, a five-bay building numbered 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 at 595 Lane, Aomen Road. The fire brigade dispatched vehicles to the scene and extinguished the fire. The drying platform was completely destroyed, and the building was also affected. The loss was still minor, but a large amount of rayon stored inside was waterlogged, resulting in a considerable loss.

### Cotton Textile Workers' Union Moves to a New Office Address

The Cotton Textile Workers' Association of this city has moved to 祥安坊, West 7-Pu Road, Gansu Road, due to the small size of the original premises. The second membership congress is about to be held, and there is a large influx of members. The office space is insufficient for use.

### Labor and Management Conduct Sincere Negotiations; Labor Disputes Are Resolved One After Another

### Worker at Yihe Yarn Factory Dies from Injuries; Business Comrades Go on Strike for Two Hours Yesterday

Recently, various labor disputes have arisen one after another, causing concern among all sectors of society. It is reported that the labor disputes involving the moving car company and the Cathay Hotel have been satisfactorily resolved through sincere negotiations between labor and management. However, the business comrades requested higher salaries. As General Manager Wang has been in Hong Kong and has not yet responded, the comrades took a two-hour strike yesterday to express their determination and urge the management to be aware of the situation, while still adhering to their posts to show consistency. This shows the sincerity of protecting the museum.

### Terms for Resuming Work at Moving Car Companies

The approximately 500 drivers and laborers of the four moving car companies in this city, namely China, Taiping, Yong'an, and Shangtian, went on strike on the 6th due to unsuccessful demands for wage increases. The strike has lasted for two weeks. It was learned yesterday that the drivers' union, represented by Sun Lianshan, Liu Fu, and Xu Xiangcheng, held sincere negotiations with representatives from both labor and management. A satisfactory resolution was reached at 5 PM yesterday. Workers at China and Taiping companies received an increase of 18 yuan in rice subsidies, Yong'an increased by 30 yuan, and Shangtian increased by 24 yuan. Wages were paid as usual during the strike period. In addition, ten labor contracts were established, the most important of which included the following: if vehicles are fined for overloading while loading goods, the drivers' wages will be paid by the employer; if drivers and laborers are injured on duty, medical expenses will be borne by the employer, and wages will be paid as usual; compensation will be given for work-related injuries, deaths, or disabilities; and three days of holiday will be given for the lunar New Year.

### Labor Dispute at Cathay Hotel Resolved Suddenly

The labor dispute at the Cathay Hotel was resolved yesterday afternoon after the new manager of the hotel, Mr. Li Ziman, negotiated with worker representatives for one hour and persuaded the workers to resume work. It is reported that Mr. Li Ziman was appointed as the manager of the hotel at 3 PM the day before yesterday. He resolved the labor dispute only 24 hours after taking office. As for the workers' previous demands, which included a 100% increase in salary in addition to the cost-of-living allowance, the exact terms of the resumption of work are unknown because neither party has made any announcements.

### Worker Dies in Yihe Tragedy

Wang Chunyou, a worker at the British-owned New Yihe Yarn Factory who was seriously injured in a bloody tragedy caused by demands for wage increases, has died. His body was sent to the Jiaozhou Road Forensic Examination Office for inspection. His widow, Ms. Wang Hu, claimed the body and placed it in a coffin for temporary storage at the Central Funeral Home. The 80,000 dockworkers in the city expressed their deep sympathy and have organized a support association for the tragedy. It is also reported that the workers at the factory have organized a strike committee. It is hoped that the labor and management sides will engage in sincere cooperation to resolve the matter as soon as possible to avoid serious consequences.

### Final Appeal from Business Comrades

The Comrades Association of the Commercial Press requested the company to improve their treatment due to soaring prices and difficult living conditions and set a deadline of five days for a reply. Yesterday was the deadline, but the authorities have not yet responded. Therefore, an emergency executive meeting was convened and resolved to take the overall situation into consideration and to avoid turning China's largest cultural institution into a serious labor dispute. The deadline was extended by three days to prompt the company to finally become aware. At the same time, to show their determination, a two-hour strike was initiated. From 3 PM to 5 PM yesterday, all comrades adhered to their posts and maintained order. A letter to the compatriots of the whole country was published as a final appeal.

### Asia Oil Tanker Attacked in Songkou; Bullet Marks Everywhere, Fortunately No One Was Injured

The Shanghai Times reported that the Asia Petroleum Company's oil tanker Fuguang (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai last night (17th) from Hong Kong. It was reported that the ship encountered a steamer outside Turnabout Island on its way to Shanghai and issued a signal. The captain of the Fuguang believed that the steamer was an auxiliary ship of the Japanese Navy and signaled it to stop for inspection. Therefore, he instructed the ship to proceed slowly. As it approached, he caught a glimpse of the steamer not flying any flags and towing two sailboats. Realizing that something was wrong, he ordered the ship to move at full speed, resulting in the steamer using machine guns to strafe the ship. The smokestack and deck were riddled with bullet holes. Fortunately, the crew took cover and were not killed or injured, and the ship managed to escape.

### Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Ke Ziwei, Reports on the Administrative Situation (2)

### Speech at the Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers the Other Day

### Article 7 of the Budget Proposal

The Council's semi-annual budget has been published, and I trust that you have reviewed it. Therefore, I only intend to clarify a few key points of the budget.

### Regular Income of Approximately 80 Million

The Council's total budget for regular income for this year lists 79,119,740 yuan, an increase of 37,257,990 yuan compared to the previous year. The increase in the collection rate of housing donations, land taxes, and license fees has been approved by the previous special meeting of taxpayers and has been included in the budget. In addition, the expected increase in income from the revaluation of self-used properties and the total income from the outer road areas have also been included in the budget. It is expected that if the various recommendations of the Tax System Committee are adopted, the income from the general donation and special housing donation will not be reduced. The income from various public utilities is higher than last year, the biggest reason for which is the increase in the fee rates and additional fees of the companies, which has been approved by the Council. The Council has carefully considered the requests for price increases from various companies and has only approved them after detailed examination of their accounts.

### 方單 Tax and License Fees

Regarding the preparation of various donation rate tables, there are two points that deserve special explanation. The first point is that, according to the opinion of lawyers, an item of "collection of land tax for developed 方單 land" has been added to the table. The purpose is purely to simplify the procedure of prosecuting this land tax in court. The second point is the new method of estimating the license fees for cinemas, theaters, and similar entertainment venues. According to this new method, the amount of each license fee should be equal to one-tenth of its total income or be estimated based on its seating capacity. The license fee collected is approximately one-tenth of its total income. The above method was recently recommended by the Special Economic Committee and is planned to be implemented from May 1.

### Regular Expenses Exceed 80 Million

The estimated total of various regular expenses for this year, including education expenses, is 81,052,910 yuan, an increase of 23,575,940 yuan compared to the previous year. The budgets of various departments of the Council have been carefully reviewed by the relevant committees, and all items that can be saved without compromising administrative efficiency have been deleted.

### Huge Expenditure on Cost-of-Living Allowances

The various expenses have increased sharply due to the impact of the depreciation of the national currency and the rise in prices. For example, the income of an office clerk was only 30 yuan and 7 jiao in March of last year, but it has increased to 94 yuan and 9 jiao in the same month this year. Furthermore, the income of a Chinese constable was 50 yuan and 7 jiao in March of last year, but it is 129 yuan, 9 jiao, and 2 fen in the same month this year. The temporary cost-of-living allowance paid to foreign staff was 40% in March of last year, but it has now increased to 100% to 150%. In addition, the resumption of long-term leave for foreign staff is also one of the factors affecting the budget.

### The Future of the Orchestra Depends on the Assembly

The budget for the music corps for this year totals 378,540 yuan, exceeding the maximum amount approved by the taxpayers' meeting by 178,540 yuan. Regarding this matter, please refer to the final report of the Special Economic Committee. The report states that, according to the current policy, the question of the existence of the music corps should be determined by the taxpayers.

### Yuanzhang Jewelry Store Robbed; Loss of 200,000 Gold; Police Pursue in Cars, But Robbers Escape

At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, two robbers suddenly broke into the Yuanzhang Gold and Silver Jewelry Store at 99 Shanxi Road and committed a robbery, stealing gold and silver jewelry worth approximately 200,000 yuan. The details are as follows:

### Customers Inspect Goods and Estimate Value

Yuanzhang Gold and Silver Jewelry Store has been in business for nearly 20 years, specializing in the sale of diamonds, jade, jewelry, gold and silver ornaments, etc. The business is quite good. Recently, there have been similar customers who went to inquire about the value of the jewelry, saying they wanted to purchase it, but ultimately did not make a deal. To prevent this, the shop owner repeatedly ordered Constable No. 1247 Yan Weiqing (from Chongming, 50+ years, employed for 5 years) to keep the glass doors locked at all times and only open them when there were customers.

### Three Robbers Enter and Threaten with Guns

At about 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, three robbers suddenly arrived. Two of the robbers were wearing Chinese-style long robes, and one was wearing a coffee-colored Western suit. Each was equipped with Mauser pistols. They went to the door of the store and knocked, saying they wanted to buy jewelry. The constable believed them and opened the door. One of the robbers patted the constable on the shoulder, showed his pistol, and confiscated the constable's weapons. Seeing that the people who came were not good, the shop assistant secretly stepped on the alarm bell on the floor in the counter. At that time, one of the robbers also drew his pistol and threatened the shop assistant, forbidding him from making any noise, and blocked him into the inner room of the store.

### Smash the Counter Door and Take Away the Ornaments

Another robber used the butt of his gun to smash two pieces of glass on the side of the counter and put the valuable ornaments into a bag. He then escaped without a trace. When the police station learned of the alarm, they immediately dispatched a large number of detectives in cars to rush to the scene, but the robbers had already escaped two or three minutes earlier. After investigation, it was found that gold, silver, jade, and platinum rings set with five-carat diamonds, totaling twenty-four pieces, six gold bracelets, and six diamond rings were stolen, with an estimated value of more than 100,000 yuan. The jewelry was marked with the letters "YO". A list of lost items has been compiled and reported to the police station for tracking down the fleeing robbers.

### Black-Plate Car Robbed on Park Road This Morning

This morning, a black-plate car (Registration No. 6652) was parked near Park Road on Jing'an Temple Road at 12:15 AM when two men suddenly appeared with three handguns. They forced the driver to open the door. The driver dared not resist and opened the car door. After the two men got into the car, they ordered the driver to drive to the intersection of Seymour Road, where they forced the driver out of the car. One of the men drove away at full speed, heading west. The driver immediately reported the incident to the police station. The car had not been found as of 3 AM this morning.

### Lu Ying's Bodyguards Fight with Police; Two Dead, One Injured

### Lu Visits Friends Late at Night; Bodyguards Loiter at Lane Entrance; Detectives Suspect and Open Fire During Interrogation

Yesterday morning, a shooting incident occurred in the concession, involving Lu Ying's bodyguards and patrolmen from the French Concession police station due to a misunderstanding. As a result, two of Lu's bodyguards were shot and killed, and one was seriously injured. The details of the incident are as follows:

### Visiting Friends Late at Night

At around 1 AM yesterday morning, Lu, the "Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau," traveled in an armored car No. 499 with his bodyguards Han Wenzhi, Zhang Xinglong, Liu Guangyuan, Lin Xiangyun, and others, as well as in a black carriage No. 6456, to Lane 125, Groshi Road, in the French Concession, turning into Da De Li at the south entrance of the lane. The main lane is at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Maiyang Road. After Lu arrived at the lane, he walked into the house of Mr. Xu, who held an important position in Shanghai. His car and bodyguards retreated to the entrance of Groshi Road and waited.

### Misunderstanding and Shooting

At 1:30 AM, a Chinese constable No. 1020 from the French Concession police station was on duty in the area. Seeing Lu's bodyguards at the entrance of the lane, all with bulky objects by their sides, and given the late hour, he suspected they were criminals. He secretly reported to Patrol No. 18, Vietnamese Constable No. 442, and other patrol teams who were patrolling the road. The constables, hearing about recent bloody incidents, drew their guns and approached to interrogate them. At the time, Lu's bodyguards did not identify themselves. One of them even reached into his pocket and pulled out a gun. Seeing this, the constables fired first. The bodyguards, seeing the constables firing, also fired back. The gunfire was intense, like a string of firecrackers.

### Two Dead, One Injured

Han Wenzhi, a Korean from the east who was lying next to the car and a bodyguard of Lu, was shot in the head and chest, and died on the spot beside the car. In addition, Liu Guangyuan (30 years old) from Hebei and Zhang Xinglong (47 years old) from Ningbo were also shot. Zhang was shot in the chest, and Liu was shot in the right flank. Both fell into a pool of blood. The other three bodyguards, seeing the situation was not good, fled into the armored car with their weapons. The constables fired at the car, causing numerous bullet marks on the car's exterior, but the bullets did not penetrate the interior, so the three bodyguards and the driver were not injured.

### Police Station Investigates Thoroughly

At that time, the French police station also received the news and still suspected that they were criminals resisting arrest. They dispatched hundreds of Chinese and Western detectives in police cars to surround the area. When they arrived at the car, they discovered that the car belonged to Lu. Realizing that something was wrong, they ordered Lu's bodyguard Lin Xiangyun and others out of the car and asked them about the truth, only to learn that it was all a misunderstanding. They then sent the three dead and wounded bodyguards to the hospital and the forensic examination office. However, Zhang Xinglong died at 8 AM due to his serious injuries. Liu's injuries were also severe, but it was reported that the bullet had been removed. Afterwards, the French police station took all those involved in the incident back to the police station to investigate the truth.

As a result of negotiations, Zhou Wenyu, the person in charge of the company, paid Hu Zhide 10,000 national currency as

### Leaving Henglong

Equity. However, Hu Xuelin recently demanded money from Zhou again. Zhou said that Hu's shares had already been withdrawn, and there was no reason to pay any more money. If Hu Xuelin needed money, he should negotiate with his brother, which had nothing to do with him. Therefore, he rejected his request. Hu Xuelin held a grudge and sent a threatening letter to Zhou on the 27th of last month, ordering Zhou to quickly pay 20,000 yuan, or else

When questioned, Hu and others claimed that the letter was written by a fugitive surnamed Cui and that they did not know about it beforehand. After questioning by Judge Feng, the sentencing was set for the morning of the 20th.

### Free Talk; Small Talk; The Blind Men and the Elephant; Wu Dai

Because of the complicated social environment and interpersonal relationships, things in the world are rarely absolute, and they can rarely be summarized completely in a few simple words. Take a person's failure and downfall, for example. Generally, older people tend to believe that it is due to the individual's lack of effort and weak will, while young people mostly blame the poor social environment, somewhat ignoring or negating the individual's power. In fact, both extreme views oversimplify the matter.

The safest point of view should take everything into account, so this matter should also be viewed from both sides.

The fact that the social environment has not yet reached rationality and perfection is undeniable. Due to the poor environment, many people's efforts have been in vain. However, on the other hand, you cannot completely push all the responsibility onto society and the environment. Although today's social environment is indeed not good, in many cases individual power still plays a considerable role. We only need to go to the beggar shelters to take a look. The people housed inside come in all shapes and sizes, and are not all illiterate. Some have been county magistrates, some have been English secretaries, and some are normal school graduates. Their environment should have been quite good, but they have also become beggars. Most of them have taken the shortcut to depravity, associating with bad friends and becoming addicted to drugs. Although this can also be said to be related to the broad "social environment," we cannot but place part of the responsibility on themselves. Because this is related to the individual's education, will, habits, cultivation, and vision. So I say, the social environment is indeed bad, but they themselves are also not good.

Regarding such matters, the most sound view is to take everything into account. If you do not examine all the facts clearly and then make a hasty judgment, isn't that just re-enacting the farce of the blind men and the elephant?

### Social Robber; Yang Yan

(This is, of course, just a fictional text, but who can guarantee that it will not become a reality?)

I don't need to hide it. I'll tell you frankly, I am a robber.

You don't need to be surprised, and you don't need to look at me with that astonished look. I am not some hero who robs houses, kills people, and sets fires, nor am I some American-style bandit who drinks beer with a woman in his arms. I am just an extremely ordinary robber. The crime I committed is just an extremely small robbery. Really, it's too small, too insignificant. I only robbed a few loaves of bread. But, what cursed bread! Because of it, I was given the evil name of a criminal and walked into that terrifying prison.

You ask me why I robbed? I knew you would ask me that. There is no other reason. The only reason is "hunger." I am "hungry." I need food. I need to survive, so I can only "rob."

You ask me why I don't go to work? But what work do you want me to do? How do you want me to get work? I have already walked every path to make a living. I have already knocked on every door of employment. I sincerely poured out my heart, and I said to people: I have the strength of a calf, I have the spirit to endure hardship, and I am willing to work hard for them, only hoping for some extremely meager reward. But what did I get? All I got was: contempt, indifference, cold words, and ridicule. Every time I mustered up the courage to ask people, every time I left them silently with tears of disappointment and embarrassing wounds.

You say "starving to death is a small matter, losing one's integrity is a big matter"? Yes, I admit it. I have also received so-called "higher education," and I have also read such words in books. But, heavens! Do you know the pain a person feels when he sees his loving mother, his lovely wife, and his beloved child being attacked by hunger and cold? Do you know what it's like to not eat anything for three days?

At first, I also comforted myself, saying, "We must endure the current pain. God will have mercy on us, and he will give us light." But what is the reality? I witnessed some people getting rich because of speculation, hoarding, selling their souls, and betraying the public. They live in Western-style houses, ride in cars, eat fancy food, and watch movies. They are always happy and enjoying themselves. God also seems to only have mercy on them, and has forgotten us. Ah! Why can they enjoy themselves, while I have to endure? Isn't the money they use to enjoy themselves our blood and sweat? Aren't the various benefits that they plunder and take as their own precisely what should belong to the public? What have they done to benefit the public? Why should they be happy and enjoy themselves forever, while I have to endure, suffer, and even starve to death?

All of this is unfair. All of this is worthy of cursing. I can't stand it anymore. So I decided to rob. I am still young. I don't need to die. I still want to live. I still want to live on, live on....

Indeed, I have been to prison. I have been beaten for this small "robbery." But I tell you, I don't regret it at all. I am not afraid at all. I only feel resentment and injustice. Why do some people deprive many people of their benefits without committing a crime, while I only robbed a few loaves of bread and am considered to have committed a crime? I tell you again, I have deeply understood that there is no justice, no sympathy, no fairness in this world. There is nothing. All there is is "power"! God is just an appendage of the powerful.

Look! The explosives buried underground have already been lit. One day, all unfair phenomena will be eliminated.

### Essay; A Body Desires to Fly, But is Sick in Bed; Sick Prisoner

I am a seeker of work, but I cannot work. I can only pursue the joy of work in my imagination. So I started dreaming dreams:

It's a miracle. I suddenly received treatment from advanced medical technology and was freed from the clutches of the devil of illness! My two feet, which had been disabled for ten years, regained their motor function and were able to leap up! At the same time, my neurasthenia and illness were also completely cured! So I can do any work I love, and I re-feel the joy of life. In order to make up for the waste of my past life, I cherish my time very much. I want to be the busiest person. As long as my health allows, three hours of sleep every night is enough. However, the work I do must be the most beneficial to the people. I have to first find a career, as long as it benefits society, the country, and suits my personality, and can develop my ambitions. The low status of the occupation and the meager remuneration are not a concern. I want to make full use of my remaining time to engage in social activities, such as increasing children's welfare, improving women's status, and improving the public's health and life. I am willing to do these things enthusiastically and practically. I will also increase a little light and beauty to this world. I also want to do my best to help people who have dropped out of school at any time, and I will generously give them all the knowledge I have. I feel that this is the happiest thing in life. In order to increase my contribution to society, I will strive to learn, constantly enrich myself, and cultivate myself. In addition to serving, I will devote my life to learning, without being restricted by age. I may go to university at the age of forty or fifty to study education, psychology, medicine, and other subjects that I love. In foreign countries, female students in their fifties and sixties are common, but it has never been heard of in our country. So, I can also win some glory for our Chinese women.

Reality is ultimately cruel. When I realized that I was lying in bed, my happiness and glory all vanished. (Royalties donated to children's library)

### Begonia; Qin Shouou

(7) Draw a Cross on Your Face

Ji Zhaoxiong did not expect that he would reveal such a flaw.

"Let's not mention the past!" He pushed a plate of white tripe that the waiter had just served to his guest, with a flattering expression, as if begging: "Second Brother Wang, you can rest assured this time. As long as anyone can find their lair, I, Ji, will be sure to show him fifty or one hundred yuan. If I go back on my word, I will be your grandson!"

Wang Lao'er first picked up the last piece of beef left on the plate, put it in his mouth, and then smiled coldly.

"Don't brag, Ji Lao Wu! You haven't paid back the twenty yuan you owe Zhou Tuzhi!"

"I said you are all fools, and that's right!" Ji Zhaoxiong also unbuttoned a row of buttons on his chest, slightly raised his bull's head and said, "You are good at fighting, and you are righteous. Of course, you are all considered good friends in this Tianjin dock." He saw Wang Lao'er's face suddenly darken when he heard the words "fool," fearing to offend him, he hurriedly changed his tone and praised him a few times. "It's just that you are too straightforward in your life and don't use your brains in everything. Do you think I, Ji Zhaoxiong, have to pay out this money myself? No, where do I have money! As long as you copy out his roots, I will open my mouth wide to him. He knows that the handle is in my hands, and his courage will naturally shrink."

"Then how much do you want from him?" Wang Lao'er asked with an attitude of absolute distrust.

This was not something Ji Zhaoxiong was willing to explain. Even if he was willing, he couldn't say it now. Because he not only thinks about money all day long, but also has a greedy heart that can never be satisfied. When he doesn't have a hundred, he thinks it's enough to get a hundred, but when someone really gives him a hundred, he will definitely want two hundred. So, to tell the truth, he himself doesn't know how much he wants from Begonia!

"I don't want much, three hundred yuan can allow me to pay off a few old debts, so that I don't have to bow my head when I see people, and I can let him go," Ji Zhaoxiong said with a seemingly content expression. (85)

### Arts and Entertainment World; Movie Emperor Mickey Rooney Elected "Worst Movie Star"; Li Du

The Harvard University's school newspaper has an annual tradition of publishing articles electing the "worst movie stars," and its unique insights often amaze Hollywood people. This year's winners include Mickey Rooney, whose title is "Most Hated Movie Star," Ava Gardner and Henry Fonda are "Worst Acting Movie Stars," Robert Preston is "Worst Movie Person of the Year," and Victor Mature is "Hopeless." In retaliation, various film companies hired Harvard graduates as extras, whose annual acting income is only thirty-two yuan, less than one percent of the income of the "worst movie stars."

### Gable's New Film

Clark Gable recently had an illness, so he has not been to MGM's set for a long time. There is much speculation outside, saying that he is determined to retire, and there are also rumors that he will divorce Carole Lombard. In fact, both are unreliable. MGM has prepared three new films for Gable, namely THO Uniflrm, Witch of the Wilderness, and Goapy Smith. THO Uniflrm began filming in early April.

### Lightning Marriage

In addition to adopting a girl, Ava Gardner will follow in the footsteps of Bette Davis and marry a New York gentleman in a lightning manner. According to Ava Crawford, she has signed a four-year long-term contract with MGM, and her new work is "A Woman's Face," co-starring with Melvin Douglas.

### Changing Horses

Joan Crawford had the image of Huo Huashi with her in the spring of this year a few months ago. The reason is that Howard Hughes has been passionate about a Qi Ge Fei girl recently, so Joan's boyfriend has changed to Norris. Zha Nuo is the ex-husband of Wu Nvlang, An Xiuli Dan, and is also a handsome young man.

### Tough Guy Dancing

James Cagney is tired of the gangster role. He once told people that he wanted to co-star in a song and dance film with Meng Laiya Aistan. When the matter was heard by Aistan, he expressed his welcome to the cooperation. The reason is that he has a very high opinion of Cagney's dancing skills, saying that Cagney's dancing skills are very admirable. He said that Cagney's song and dance film Footlight Parade, which he starred in years ago, still leaves a deep impression.

### Drama News; Old Capital; Yan Zhao Louzhu

### Shanghai; Juexin

Since Xun Huisheng stopped performing at the Golden Grand Theater, Wu Sheng, Zhao Jiao Tian, was originally invited to support the construction team. However, Ling was recently troubled by illness. After being diagnosed by Ding Jiwan, Zhou saw an improvement, and he will soon be hospitalized for treatment. Therefore, the theater can only temporarily transition with box office rehearsals and drama schools. Ma Zhizhong, the theater's invitation director, returned to Shanghai from Peiping. He can arrive tomorrow. This task is to discuss bringing Xi Xiaobo and Hou Yulan to Shanghai to perform early

### American Regular Radio Station to Broadcast to Shanghai Tonight

Out of a desire to express sincere and genuine friendship towards China, the United States had the Pearl Harbor radio station broadcast to China during last year's New Year. This year, on the 30th of last month, the newest shortwave radio station in Boston, WRUL, began broadcasting daily to Shanghai and the Far East. (Note: the shortwave machine's wavelength is 11.79; Shanghai can listen in every day at 10 a.m.) Recently, the shortwave machine of the General Electric Company radio station in San Francisco, USA, will follow suit, broadcasting to China daily starting tonight. Tonight at 3 a.m. will be the formal opening; Shanghai time will be 1 p.m. on the 20th.
