### The Far Eastern Situation is Extremely Serious; American Policy Will Not Relax; New York Market Filled with the Terror of War; British Commander-in-Chief Discusses the Situation in Australia

WASHINGTON - The arrival of Japan's new ambassador to the United States, Nomura Kichisaburo, and the recent developments of serious matters have given observers of the Far East and Islands Committee yesterday the impression that the current situation is extremely serious. The arrival of Nomura, President Roosevelt's statement on the United States' position in the Far East, and the Navy Department's additional request for 900 million US dollars are regarded by those concerned as complex factors affecting the diplomatic situation in the Far East. President Roosevelt's statement to reporters that even if the United States were to be drawn into the Far Eastern war, its aid to Britain would not be affected was interpreted 24 hours later as a hint to Japan and Germany, namely that the joint action of the Axis powers would not affect the United States' tough policy in the Far East. A Royalist member of parliament from Rhode Island, a supporter of the government's foreign policy, said that the United States' policy toward Japan would not relax even if Britain collapsed. At the same time, the Congress expressed the possibility of accepting Japan's proposal for friendship. (United Press, 13th)

WASHINGTON - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday accepted the House's amendments to the Lend-Lease Act, including a limit of 1.3 billion US dollars for the transfer of defense materials to foreign countries in cash or on order. The committee rejected, by a vote of 13 to 10, the Republican proposal that the President should obtain the approval of the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Chief of Naval Operations before transferring vehicles of war to foreign countries. A motion by Republican Senator Taft of Ohio to lend 1.5 billion US dollars to Britain, 500 million to Canada, 50 million to Greece, and seven other amendments were all rejected.

It is said that the politicians discussed world politics. (United Press, 13th)

The House of Representatives has also voted on the same provision. (United Press, 13th)

WASHINGTON - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday rejected an amendment stipulating that the President must first obtain certification from the heads of the Army and Navy before transferring existing military equipment to any other country.

It is noted that the House of Representatives had previously included a provision in the aid-to-Britain bill requiring the President to consult with the heads of the Army and Navy before taking action. There were rumors that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had approved in principle four amendments to the bill passed by the House of Representatives: (1) Limiting the period of the act to the end of June 1943; (2) Congress has the power to terminate the effectiveness of the act before the end of June 1943 through the passage of a temporary proposal, which only requires a majority vote in the Senate and House of Representatives and is not subject to presidential veto; (3) The provisions of this act shall not be construed as permitting naval escort; (4) The President and the heads of the Army and Navy must first consult before the President can issue an order to transfer existing military equipment. (Reuters, 13th)

WASHINGTON - Secretary of the Navy Knox stated yesterday that he "opposes further weakening the US Navy" by aiding the British fleet with another batch of warships. Knox said that the United States currently has 159 destroyers, with another 15 to be completed this year and 45 more to be completed next year. If we want to maintain a complete fleet, we cannot transfer our destroyers again. He also said that Britain has never requested to obtain the US fleet. The Navy Department is now working to quickly establish a two-ocean navy. The Secretary of the Navy pointed out that the speed of shipbuilding, including battleships, has been accelerated by 30 to 100 days compared to the original schedule. The 35,000-ton "North Carolina" will be completed in mid-April, and her sister ship "Washington" will be completed in mid-July. He also said that the Navy Department received destroyers in January that would have taken ten months to build, which was eight months ahead of schedule. He further stated that aircraft production has also increased, with a total of 900 to 1,000 produced last month, compared to only 799 in December of last year. (United Press, 13th)

WASHINGTON - Willkie issued a telegraphic statement in New York yesterday, saying that President Roosevelt believes that the United States can immediately provide Britain with additional destroyers. "I am deeply surprised by Colonel Knox's statement." "The information given to me by senior government officials after I made my arguments yesterday proves that my claims are not wrong. We do have the power to provide Britain with additional destroyers as effective assistance without harming our navy and national defense." (United Press, 13th)

WASHINGTON - Informed sources say that President Roosevelt intends to strongly advocate that the British government, in order to obtain assistance under the lend-lease program, should agree to issue secret orders to the commanders of all ships of the British Navy that if Germany occupies Britain, the British ships should sail to American ports. This is not a plan by the President to prevent the British Navy from continuing to fight in other bases, but simply to prevent all or part of the British Navy from falling into German hands. At the same time, the International News Service predicts that the lend-lease bill to fully aid the democratic countries will pass in the Senate with 64 to 70 votes. Most of those who support the bill predict that the President will achieve his greatest victory since entering the White House. The rumored plan regarding the British Navy has been discussed with US military experts. According to the experts, the British fleet falling into German hands is the most tragic thing in the war, and this development will make the United States vulnerable to attack and render the current two-ocean navy ineffective.

Editorial

### How is America's Military Strategy Arranged?

President Roosevelt made an important statement to reporters the other day, the main purpose of which was to explain that even if the United States were forced to join the Far Eastern war, the supply of war materials to Britain would not be slightly affected. The newspaper has commented on this speech. According to the telegram, the New York Stock Exchange market was filled with the terror of war yesterday, and experts, in view of the current unstable situation, are unwilling to make predictions and are mostly cautious. In Shanghai, there are also many people who mistakenly believe that the United States is about to join the war. In fact, regardless of who is willing or unwilling for the United States to join the war, regardless of whether the impact of the United States' actions is beneficial or harmful, and regardless of whether the United States will eventually fight or not, it is absolutely not enough to take President Roosevelt's speech as evidence of the United States' participation in the war. The content of President Roosevelt's speech has its own new hints; that is, people should have a different understanding of the United States before and after listening to President Roosevelt's speech. The firmness of American policy has long been understood by the world, and the sense of shared fate between the United States and Britain is also common knowledge in the world; therefore, many people believe that the United States wants to give strong support to Britain, and the United States is more vigilant and committed to the Atlantic: now, from President Roosevelt's speech, it can be inferred that the United States and Britain cooperate and divide the labor on the international mission of suppressing chaos, and the United States does not focus on the Atlantic but on the Pacific, that is, there is a greater possibility of joining the war in the Far East, and will exert greater efforts; this is the first point. Although American policy is firm, the world is only worried that it is limited by facts and cannot take care of everything, and the result of the United States' bias towards Europe may be to forgive and indulge the aggressors in the Far East, or to make the empty threats of the Far East effective in containing the United States' efforts in Europe: now, from President Roosevelt's speech, we know that the United States can maintain its firm policy towards Europe and the Far East, and strive for implementation on both sides, with no fear of neglecting one over the other; moreover, President Roosevelt's speech is corroborated by Secretary of State Hull's speech last winter, which explicitly pointed out the Far East first. It is truly a coincidence, not accidental, but a plan to take the pacification of the Far East as its own responsibility; this is the second point. The so-called firm policy is of course not subject to any wavering, but there are many people who attempt to waver it, and who doubt that there may be room for wavering; now President Roosevelt's speech was aptly released on the day that Japanese Ambassador Nomura arrived in the United States, which rejected the boring attempts to waver and avoided the boring diplomatic rhetoric and waste; what President Roosevelt reserved was to wait for how his "old friend" Nomura represents the Japanese government to express whether to accept American policy; this is the third point. To what extent has the huge "arsenal of democracy" actually developed its production capacity has long been watched by the world; now President Roosevelt's speech has given the world a comprehensive and satisfactory answer; this is the fourth point. These four points have made the world's understanding of the United States clear and accurate. However, this does not mean that the United States is about to join the war, or that the United States is about to join the war in the Far East. President Roosevelt's assumption of participating in the Far Eastern war emphasizes "forced"; forced is not on one's own initiative, so the key to whether the United States fights or not lies in whether someone forces it to participate in the Far Eastern war; in short, it depends on whether Japan forces it. On this issue, although we deeply believe in the firmness of American policy, we still cannot help but feel a sense of vagueness, and a sense of detachment. Because if Japan starts a war with the United States, unless it starts with violating the Nine-Power Treaty, it is difficult to imagine that Japan will take an action against the United States that is even worse than violating the Nine-Power Treaty in the future. What can be imagined is: one is that Japan is crazy, and the other is that Germany and Italy have won a great victory in Europe. The actions of a madman cannot be said by himself, so they are not under our discussion. As for the victory of Germany and Italy, although we know from President Roosevelt's speech that the United States will not change its Far Eastern policy because of this, the complex facts cannot be covered by simple principles. For example, the Nine-Power Treaty has been despised, the declaration to maintain the status quo of Vietnam has been despised, and now it is frequently reported that Thailand has also allowed aggressors to use air and sea bases; these facts of progress and advancement, and the principle that American interests should not be infringed upon any further, are placed before the United States at the same time. Although the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, and the East Indies are all regarded by the United States as its own national defense front line and can no longer be allowed to be abandoned, the successive fall of Vietnam and Thailand into bases of aggression, what is the feeling and evaluation of the United States in terms of the degree of "forcing" the United States? There may be tolerant explanations in terms of policy principles, but in terms of military strategy, can it be denied that it is a strategically important layout? These layouts are the starting stones; if they are not removed, they will lose their function following the failure of Germany and Italy in Europe; but if Britain fails in Europe, then these layouts will immediately exert their various crushing and sharing effects. Therefore, although American policy is firm and there is no doubt about it, and although the massive production of American military power has been successful, we cannot help but worry whether the layout of military strategy can avoid falling behind others.

### Japanese Invasion of China Suffers Serious Blow; Failure in Henan is the Beginning; Extreme Losses and No Gains

CHONGQING - Chinese military experts said today that the Japanese army's attack in southern Henan is equivalent to a sightseeing tour of suffering and starvation along the way. A spokesperson said that the Japanese army began its northward attack from Xinyang on the Pinghan Road on January 24, and at the same time launched a southward attack from Kai on the Suihai Road. The failure of this attack is the beginning of the decline of Japanese military action in China. The Japanese army has hundreds of thousands of troops, and uses strong mechanized units in the Daping Mountains of Henan Province, but still cannot occupy the area or inflict heavy damage on the Chinese army. The Japanese army has only been on a sightseeing tour of suffering and starvation north of Xinyang for two weeks. (United Press, 13th)

### US Military Attaches Importance to the Military Value of the Philippines, Saying Its Importance Is No Less Than That of Singapore

Washington, Military circles here have closely studied the announcement from Manila yesterday regarding the recall of Philippine reserve forces for military training. Military personnel stated that this news is in line with the feeling here that Philippine defense preparations should be diligently adjusted. Elichate, the head of the Philippine Resident Commissioner in Washington, recently warned the Filipinos that the situation is becoming increasingly serious and urged them to make preparations. According to reliable sources, this warning by Elichate is also the reason for promoting Philippine preparations. Military circles here have abandoned the previous view that the Philippines is indefensible. Some military personnel even advocate that the United States should pay more attention to the Philippines than to Singapore. (United Press telegram, 13th)

Washington, Philippine economic experts paid close attention yesterday to the news that the United States is setting up a steel mill in Houston, Texas, with US$10 million, recognizing it as a precursor to the shift of the steel industry to the west coast, which is closer to the Philippines' mineral resources. However, experts said that setting up a steel mill in Houston would not greatly help the development of the Philippine mining industry, because the shipping costs from the Philippines to Houston are almost the same as the shipping costs from the Philippines to New York and Baltimore. They also said that the biggest expense is the shipping cost through the Panama Canal. However, setting up a factory in Houston is a trend, so once a factory is also set up on the other side of the canal, the Philippines can economically ship its mineral products. (United Press telegram, 13th)

### US Military Experts Emphasize Infantry, Saying It Is the Queen of the Army

Washington, The high command now recognizes the infantry as the "Queen of the Army." Although the air force and modern mechanized warfare equipment have attracted the world's attention, the need for the infantry to be up-to-date is still not being ignored. Tanks may be able to break through enemy lines and put enemy reinforcements in a state of panic. Aircraft may be able to fly into the enemy's rear and carry out bombing in areas beyond the range of heavy artillery, but the infantry is still the arm of the army. After all, to advance on enemy positions or hold the front line to wait for friendly forces or retreat, only the infantry can achieve this. One hundred and sixty-two rifles, five thousand and seventy-six rifles, thirty-six 37 mm anti-tank guns, eighty-one light mortars, thirty-six 81 mm mortars, and eight 75 mm tank guns, this number is larger than the old streamlined infantry division. When the military begins an offensive, the streamlined division quickly develops behind the armored division to consolidate the captured positions and transfers the positions to the ordinary division that follows closely behind. The army also believes that since the adoption of the Garand rifle, the power of the infantry has greatly increased, because the recoil of this new rifle is not as strong as that of the Springfield, so soldiers can fire several more rounds a day without feeling overwhelmed. In addition, the current improvement of the infantry is divided into two categories: one is to enable it to reach the front quickly, and the other is to equip it with heavy weapons so that it can attack fiercely when advancing and defend firmly when retreating. In terms of speed, it can be given a streamlined mechanical configuration. In terms of power, it can be achieved by adding heavy weapons such as automatic rapid-firing guns. At present, the US regular army has nine streamlined or triangular infantry divisions, and the National Guard has another eighteen old-fashioned or "square" infantry divisions from the last World War. The nine streamlined infantry divisions have a total of 13,567 people, of which 8,910 are infantry soldiers, and the rest are artillery and other soldiers. Each streamlined division has 144 .30-caliber heavy machine guns, 108 light machine guns, and 36 .50-caliber machine guns. Since the new rifle also has another advantage, namely that the speed has increased and is also more accurate. (United Press telegram, 13th)

### British House of Commons Discusses Trade Issues in North China

London, The British House of Commons raised the issue of trade difficulties in North China yesterday. Conservative MP Morgan asked the Foreign Secretary whether trade in North China must be paid for with Federal Reserve notes in order to export, and whether foreign goods are not allowed to be imported into North China without a license from the Federal Reserve Bank. Has Britain negotiated with Japan on this restriction in conflict with Japan's guarantee not to harm the interests of foreigners? Undersecretary Whiteley replied that this fact is well known and that the British government has repeatedly negotiated with other governments but has not received a satisfactory reply.

### Senior Soviet Official in London Says Germany Will Not Forcibly Invade Bulgaria, Romanian Oil Fields Take Measures Against British Bombing, Netherlands and Egypt Follow Britain's Lead in Severing Ties With Romania

London, A senior Soviet official here revealed last night that Germany will not forcibly invade Bulgaria without consulting the Soviet Union. However, Germany has not yet consulted the Soviet Union. It is said that Germany's "showing off its military might" to Bulgaria and its posturing in the Balkans is aimed at intimidating Greece and separately reaching a peace with Italy. As for the rumors that German troops are pouring into Bulgaria in preparation for an attack on Ukraine, in order to "coerce the Soviet Union to provide more assistance to Germany," they were denied. This speculation is quite prevalent here. It is pointed out that this move may enable the Soviet Union and Japan to sign a non-aggression pact, which Tokyo has long desired, but Stalin has been delaying month after month. It is also pointed out that once the threat of a Soviet attack on Manchuria is removed, Japan will be able to begin its southward advance, which, even if it does not engage in war with the United States, will at least restrain the US fleet in the Pacific, which will benefit Germany in any case. When this issue was raised to Soviet officials here, they replied that Germany had agreed with the Soviet Union to consult with the Soviet Union before invading Bulgaria. It was also implied that Germany cannot attack Ukraine at this time, as it would create another enemy. (International News Agency telegram, 13th)

London, London newspapers said this morning that at least 400,000 German troops are now concentrated in Romania. Some sources believe that the number of German troops in Romania has reached 600,000. At the same time, British officials today laughed off foreign reports that Britain has declared war on Romania. Yesterday, Labour MPs and Weale asked Foreign Secretary Eden whether Romania's military cooperation with Germany would not be equivalent to a declaration of war against Britain. Eden refused to answer. (International News Agency telegram, 13th)

Tokyo, The Hochi Shimbun reported that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, consisting of two battleships, four cruisers, thirty destroyers, and twenty-four submarines, began to assemble in the Bosphorus on February 7. At the same time, two million Red Army soldiers were concentrated on the Turkish-Romanian border. It is said that this telegram is based on information released by Soviet officials. Soviet officials in Vladivostok expect Spain to join the war in May. (Reuters telegram, 13th)

Tokyo, The Nichi Nichi Shimbun published an article stating that the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania has expanded the power of the Axis powers to the Balkans. Germany will do everything in its power to crush Britain, but if Germany believes that the peace of the Balkans requires the maintenance of German troops, it will not hesitate to send troops to Bulgaria, especially since it can now be said that Germany has fully consulted with Bulgaria and the Soviet Union on this matter. Britain may rely on bombing the Romanian oil fields, but it is doubtful whether this move will be effective. German troops will now probably cooperate with Italian troops to control Greece in order to threaten the British naval base in the eastern Mediterranean. (Reuters telegram, 13th)

Bucharest, After the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania, the Romanian government, fearing that Britain might bomb its oil fields, plans to evacuate the people of Ciurgiu, Ploiesti, and Constanta in advance. Detailed methods are currently being considered. Ciurgiu and Ploiesti are both located in the oil fields, while the port of Constanta is the main port for oil exports. The Romanian government has taken various measures in politics and economics to prepare for emergencies, such as strengthening precautions against foreign activities. A curfew is enforced nationwide, and no one is allowed to go out from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am without special permits. The military authorities in Bucharest have notified the people that anyone who goes out during the curfew without a special pass will be punished by military law if caught. The national grain harvest has been sealed by the state to distribute food equally to the military and civilians. Economic activities in all aspects have been expanded to increase production, and 300 farmland tractors recently shipped from Germany have been distributed to farmers in various places to increase land production. Various glycerols are requisitioned for the manufacture of explosives, while the export of various drugs is reduced as much as possible. As for the rumors that Turkish expatriates will leave soon, this statement cannot be confirmed, but the fact that the Turkish embassy was closely guarded by military police this morning is a real situation. (Havas telegram, 12th)

Bucharest, The Bucharest military authorities issued instructions on air raid drills and blackouts to be held in the city, stating that during the blackout from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am, no one may be outdoors, and violators will be arrested and tried by a military court. Anyone who does not obey the sentinel's order to stop may be shot at. (Haitong telegram, 13th)

Bucharest, The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced this morning the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania. According to the communiqué, the British Minister to Romania has notified the Romanian government that he and all the staff of the embassy and consulates have received orders from their government to be recalled. Therefore, the Romanian government has also recalled its envoys to Britain. The British envoys will leave Romania on the 15th, and diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania will be severed on that day. (Haitong News Agency telegram, 13th)

Bern, Switzerland, Regarding the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania, the notes presented by British Foreign Secretary Eden to Romanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister General Antonescu have been published in London, stating: "Since Your Excellency took office six months ago, your country has been completely controlled by Germany. Not only are there various facts to prove it, but Your Excellency has also repeatedly made statements to admit it. Your Excellency presented a note a few months ago stating that it has allowed many German military instructors to go to your country to train your troops with modern tactics and attach various military equipment. In fact, Germany's preparations to use your country's territory for military action have become increasingly obvious. In view of this situation, I have decided to recall the Minister of My Country and all diplomatic personnel." (Havas telegram, 12th)

London, It is reported that the Dutch government has now recalled its Minister to Romania. (Reuters telegram, 13th)

Bucharest, According to information obtained here, the Egyptian government will withdraw its envoys to Romania, leaving only one diplomatic representative to handle necessary matters, and the rest will leave Romania on the 18th. It is learned that Romania is about to withdraw Romanian envoys to various countries occupied by German troops. If Romania implements this plan, various countries will also withdraw their envoys to Romania. Regarding the news that Turkey and Greece are also withdrawing their envoys to Romania, it has not been confirmed. (Haitong News Agency telegram, 13th)

### British Air Force Bombs Extensively Across Europe

London – Aviation sources announced last night that British planes heavily bombed Catania and Comiso, two important Italian airfields in Sicily, in shifts of 20 minutes each, for five consecutive hours. Simultaneously, they bombed Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway, causing large fires visible from 60 miles away in the Mediterranean. Bremen and Hanover were also targeted, with British aircraft dropping several tons of bombs on the two cities. As explosions and fires erupted, the Bremen industrial targets suffered significant damage, and Hanover was enveloped in flames. Twenty-four hours later, British aircraft returned and heavily bombed the area again. The communiqué stated that “bombs dropped on Rotterdam caused a massive explosion at the oil depot. Before dawn, coastal defense air forces attacked ships within the Kristiansand Fjord in northern Norway, as well as seaplane bases.” The British Air Force also carried out raids in northern France, encountering very few German aircraft. It is claimed that in operations across various locations, the British Air Force lost only one bomber and two fighter planes. (International News Service dispatch, 13th)

### Italy Denies Ceasefire with Britain

Rome – An authoritative source here last night denied a report by an American news agency that a ceasefire between Britain and Italy was imminent, calling it unworthy of serious consideration and indicating a complete misunderstanding of Italian policy by foreigners. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 13th)

### German Peace Plan Rejected by Greece

London – According to well-informed sources, the news that Greece rejected Germany's peace plan is likely accurate. However, sources close to external affairs are unwilling to confirm or deny whether Britain has received such information. It is said that officials will naturally not comment before an announcement is made in Athens. A diplomatic writer here suggested on Sunday that Germany's activities in the Balkans were intended to threaten Greece, predicting that Germany would pressure Greece to cease hostilities and make substantial concessions to Italy. The writer further stated that Germany would only resort to force after diplomatic means had failed. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

London – British government sources reported last night that the German ambassador to Greece has presented Greece with the following peace terms between Greece and Italy: (1) Greece will be allowed to retain the territory it currently holds in Albania; (2) Greek troops will demobilize, and Greece will declare neutrality in the European war; (3) Greece requests that British troops withdraw from Greek territory and Greek waters, including the withdrawal of naval and air forces from Crete.

### Senior Thai Official Claims No Misunderstanding Between Britain and Thailand; Both Sides Still Exchanging Border Intelligence; Denies Airports Being Used by Japan

Bangkok – A senior government official told visiting reporters today that there has been absolutely no change in British-Thai relations, emphasizing that there is no misunderstanding between the two governments. The official also pointed out that the two governments are, as usual, exchanging intelligence regarding defense preparations in the border areas between Thailand and Malaya. Therefore, the Thai government does not find the reports of increased land and air force deployments on the Malayan border to be unusual. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

Bangkok – The Thai Ministry of Propaganda has formally denied reports that Thailand has allowed Japan to use Thai airports.

Thai Prime Minister Songgram hosted a banquet last night for General Sumida, head of the Japanese military mission to Vietnam. However, Thai officials remained silent on the purpose of the Japanese delegation's visit to Bangkok, but a Japanese official stated that the Japanese representative had come from Hanoi to consult with Japanese mediators here. General Sumida flew back to Saigon at 8:30 AM today. (United Press dispatch, 13th)

### European War Discussions (34): The United States on the Brink of War

Will the United States participate in the war? This is the significant question everyone is exploring. The following is a translation of the conclusions published in the New York Times on the 21st of last month:

The question of whether the United States can avoid being drawn into the vortex of this European war, which was initially seen as possible, has now become a question of whether it should participate. This shift demonstrates the movement of the war itself and American foreign policy. At the beginning of the war, the United States attempted to maintain neutrality in principle while providing practical assistance to democratic nations, yet claiming to be a non-belligerent. As Italy entered the war, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands fell one after another, France collapsed, Britain suffered severe air raids, merchant ships were repeatedly sunk, and exchange rates against the US dollar plummeted, the appearance of the question changed accordingly, even in principle, neutrality was no longer maintained. President Roosevelt even declared that Britain and the United States were closely linked, sharing the same fate.

According to the President, Germany has two major disadvantages to consider before declaring war on the US: (1) If Germany and the US go to war, German diplomats would not be able to operate in North and South America, preventing them from carrying out propaganda and plotting conspiracies. The US withdrawal of its ambassadors to Germany would not have a great impact. (2) All German and Italian ships docked in the US would be confiscated, and the British fleet could entrust the responsibility of escorting merchant ships to the US, allowing them to focus on fighting the enemy while also gaining fresh naval and air support from the US. Based on these reasons, the President and most people believe that the US can provide full assistance to Britain without being drawn into the war.

However, others argue that the US must keep most of its fleet in the Pacific, and the aircraft production rates of Britain and the US are far behind Germany, making it difficult to catch up before 1942. By then, the Axis powers may have already declared war on the US. If the US enters the war, its supply of arms to Britain would inevitably be greatly reduced.

During the last European war, the US maintained neutrality for three years before participating. This time, just one month after the war began, the US abolished the embargo on arms exports, abandoning neutrality. During the last European war, President Wilson did not declare a close relationship with Britain and France until he was preparing to declare war. Now, President Roosevelt has already declared this. During the last European war, foreigners in the US had varying attitudes towards the belligerent nations. Now, it's different. Countless Poles, anti-Nazi Germans, Italians, Czechs, French, British, Scandinavians, Greeks, Dutch, Belgians, and Irish all unanimously support the policy of aiding Britain.

Senator Vandenberg was originally a staunch isolationist, strongly opposed to intervening in the European war. When Poland was invaded, he strongly advocated for strict enforcement of neutrality laws, opposed the President's proposal to abolish the arms export embargo, and even said that as long as he could speak, he would vehemently oppose American troops being sent abroad to fight.

However, after the British forces suffered setbacks, and the general public became deeply concerned about the potential invasion of Canada, Vandenberg also agreed that the US should send troops to aid Canada if it were invaded. Seeing the occupation of Norway, Denmark, and other small countries, he realized that Hitler's disregard for faith could threaten the entire world, and he resolutely supported the President's policy of providing full support to Britain "short of war."

By December 28th of last year, when the President broadcast his fireside chat, Vandenberg also expressed his agreement, acknowledging the need to contain the power of the Axis countries. Not only that, but he also said that if the US was forced to participate in the war to ensure a just peace, he would be willing to accept the responsibility of guaranteeing it.

In short, the determination of the American people to defend democracy has now become an accepted principle, irreversible. They are currently on the edge of war, calmly watching the dark abyss, and will not be pushed into it, nor will they automatically jump in, as long as they can stand firm on this edge.

### Enjoy the Pleasures of Life

We should enjoy the pleasures of life in our lives. No matter what kind of work we do, we should always be happy and joyful, so that we can feel the joy of working. There is an old Chinese saying that "one should not open a shop without a smiling face." Indeed, there is truth in this, because how can someone succeed when they are always frowning? The ancient Greeks also had a saying, "A sound mind in a sound body." Therefore, no matter what profession we are in, we must have a healthy body.

However, no one can live without illness. Not to mention those dangerous and serious illnesses, even if there is a little pain—headache, toothache, wind or nerve pain, or menstrual pain—it is very painful. With this kind of pain, we feel disappointed because we cannot enjoy ourselves, cannot attend banquets, and even watching a movie becomes impossible.

But this pain can be ended very quickly, so there is no need to endure it. The fastest and safest way to relieve pain is to swallow one or two Saridon tablets. Within ten minutes, the pain will completely disappear, and our body will feel very comfortable. Saridon is manufactured by Roche Ltd. of Switzerland, so it is absolutely safe and reliable.

### The Far East Situation Becomes Increasingly Serious; The US Again Urges Citizens to Evacuate; US Consulate States It Is for the Safety of Citizens; They Should Evacuate as Soon as Possible While Transportation is Available

The U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday reiterated its advice to American women, children, and American citizens who do not have an essential reason to remain in Shanghai to quickly evacuate and return to the United States "for their own safety and the safety of the nation." The U.S. Consulate General's notice stated that the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai had previously issued a notice to American citizens within its jurisdiction, relaying the Secretary of State's recommendation that citizens evacuate and return to the United States. Now, the State Department has emphasized this recommendation, especially for American women, children, and men who are deemed to have no urgent need to remain here. This recommendation is issued for the safety, convenience, and national security of American citizens and is a necessary preventive measure. The State Department does not intend to send special ships to assist in the evacuation but hopes that American citizens will take advantage of the transportation currently available. The Consulate General, upon receiving the above recommendation, urgently urges the aforementioned three categories of American citizens to heed it and consider returning to the United States.

American Passports to be Replaced

The U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai announced yesterday (the 13th) that all American passports must be replaced with new passports of a completely different design before April 19th. From April 19th, old passports will be invalid. American citizens planning to depart for the United States before April 10th do not need to replace their passports. The U.S. Consulate has already mailed out passport application forms. American citizens only need to fill them out and mail them back. After receiving all the applications, the U.S. Consulate will notify American citizens individually to come to the Consulate to collect them.

Travel to the Far East is Also Restricted

According to American sources, the U.S. government's actions (recommending that unnecessary American citizens evacuate from the Far East) are entirely preventive measures regarding the situation in the Pacific. One fact proves this: previously, people from the U.S. mainland were not subject to any restrictions when traveling to Hawaii and did not need to show passports. Now, permission from the authorities is required, and an emergency decree has been issued prohibiting women and children from traveling to the Far East. Some American citizens recently returned to the Far East from the United States, attempting to bring their wives and daughters with them, but were unsuccessful due to the restrictions of the law. Even American men who want to come to the Far East without sufficient reason will not be issued passports by the authorities.

New Citizenship Law Recently Promulgated

According to news obtained yesterday from the U.S. Consulate authorities, the new citizenship law announced by the U.S. government took effect on January 23rd. Hundreds of Chinese in this city who have become American citizens will be affected by the law. The new citizenship law promulgated by the U.S. government has detailed provisions regarding naturalization and loss of citizenship. The law does not have a significant impact on American citizens by birth, but foreigners who have become American citizens will lose their American citizenship if they continue to stay in their home country for more than three years without returning to the U.S., except for those who have resided continuously in the United States and U.S. territories for more than twenty-five years. The law came into effect on January 13th, and therefore, some naturalized American citizens will lose their American citizenship within two years. The law also stipulates that if a foreigner who has become an American citizen resides in a foreign country for more than two years and automatically becomes a citizen of that place, their American citizenship will also be lost as a result. This provision is specifically aimed at totalitarian countries, because totalitarian countries often recruit people who have become American citizens into their military.

Market Rumors Run Rampant; Fluctuations Began Yesterday

In addition, after the U.S. Consul in Shanghai issued a statement recommending the evacuation of American citizens, rumors arose in the city, claiming that British authorities here had also taken similar steps, recommending that British citizens evacuate. However, after investigation by reporters, it was found to be completely baseless and untrue. However, after the occurrence of this rumor, the most affected was the stock market. Yesterday, the market experienced countless changes, and stock prices plummeted, reaching lows not seen in several weeks. Although the situation improved slightly in the afternoon, the increase was minimal. The largest declines in stock prices were seen in Wheelock and International, with the former falling from 103 yuan to 92 yuan and the latter from 24.75 yuan to 21 yuan. Other stocks also uniformly declined. At the same time, the exchange rate of the legal tender continued to be stable, with the U.S. exchange rate closing at 5 16/7. The silver dollar also declined slightly.

### Five Chinese Directors Re-elected

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told reporters today (the 13th) that the Chinese Ratepayers' Association will use postal ballots to elect Chinese directors to the Council because about half of the members are not in Shanghai, so a general meeting cannot be held. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Chinese Ratepayers have not held any meetings. It is reported that the Chinese Ratepayers' Association has not yet received any notices recommending new candidates for Chinese directors, so the current five Chinese directors are expected to be re-elected this term.

### Border Checks Between Two Concessions Become Stricter

In order to prevent the movement of criminals, the police departments of the two concessions have recently become extremely strict in checking pedestrians at the border areas. Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession Police Department, assisted by French troops stationed in Shanghai, are stationed at the border areas of Route Ghisi, Xujiahui, and Avenue Haig, Route Say Zoong, Avenue Foch, and Avenue du President Doumer day and night, selectively inspecting suspicious individuals. On the Public Concession side, after the discovery of real and fake guns on buses and trams, attention is paid to vehicles passing through the two concessions. Detectives are dispatched to board vehicles and search passengers one by one.

### Shanghai's Food Supply Sufficient, No Need to Worry

Shanghai's food reserves are extremely plentiful. Although the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly serious, there is no risk of disruption to the source of foreign rice. It is still possible to find ways to transport it in a steady stream. Moreover, Shanghai's food supply is currently well prepared. According to a survey conducted by the Rice Merchants' Association yesterday, the total amount of rice stored in warehouses throughout the city has increased sharply by 100,000 bags compared to last week.

Rumors Abound; Domestic and Foreign Rice Sources are Smooth and Unobstructed; Arrival of Sources is Extremely Crowded; People's Hearts are Extremely Weary; Hoarders are Releasing Stocks; The Rice Market has been Calm for Several Days; Rice Prices have been Declining; Yesterday the Rice Market was Flooded with Rumors; However, the Rumors were Diverse and Difficult to Ascertain; However, the Market was Affected by the Rumors; The High-End Goods Actually Had a Situation of Supply Shortage; The Crowds Were Crowded and the Order was Not as Good as Before.

Continuing to Operate the Ninth Phase of Low-Price Rice; The Low-Price Broken Rice is Currently Being Actively Prepared by the Shanghai Low-Price Rice Committee; However, Due to a Shortage of Funds, it is Impossible to Purchase All the Rice; This Depends on the Generous Donations of Enthusiastic People from All Walks of Life, So That Ordinary People Can Purchase Rice Nearby; In Addition, There is Hope for Improvement in the Method of Commissioning Rice Purchases by Various Food Groups, Due to the Shortages and Discrepancies in the Quality of the Rice After Arrival.

### City Chamber of Commerce Decides to Move to Hong Kong to Continue Operations

The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce office, after being broken into and having some documents taken the day before yesterday, is of great concern to the business community in the city. According to reliable news yesterday morning, the association has now decided to move to Hong Kong to continue its operations. It is said that Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the association, and Du Yuesheng and Jin Runxiang, members of the standing committee, had already obtained approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to establish an office of the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. All important documents had been moved there earlier, and assistant secretary Cao Zhigong was handling daily work in Hong Kong. The association now considers that various commercial goods transported from this city to Free China must hold a certificate from the association to be sold, and for the convenience and freedom of work, it has decided to move a portion of the affairs previously handled by the Shanghai office to Hong Kong to continue its operations, for the benefit of commerce.

### China Determined to Prevent Japan's Southern Advance (Continued) – Mr. Song Ziwen's Speech in New York

Under these circumstances, the most reasonable step for Japan would be to withdraw its troops and transport ships from China. For the past six months, Japan has repeatedly made peace proposals to China, and its conditions have become increasingly accommodating, and with good reason. This is because the Japanese have realized that there is no hope of eliminating the Chinese army. On the other hand, Japan is under pressure from time, and the move to advance south is also urgent. So why not make peace with China first, so that the troops in China can be transferred to the South Pacific? If the attempt on Singapore succeeds, there will be unlimited resources such as oil, tin, rubber, rice, cotton, etc. available, and the Burma Road can also be cut off, then it will not be too late to plan for China later. Japan believes that it may be possible to give China generous terms now, and once Singapore falls, all agreements will become waste paper. This wishful thinking seems very reasonable, but can the Chinese not see what the Japanese see? We deeply know that after most of the Japanese troops withdraw from China, it will give us a temporary opportunity to rest, but once Singapore falls, it will not only be a disaster for Britain, but also a misfortune for us, and ultimately perhaps a misfortune for the United States as well. The peace talks proposed by Japan at present are only a temporary truce, which is only beneficial to Japan. Therefore, we recognize that the Sino-Japanese War is part of the current universal war, so permanent peace must also be part of universal world peace, otherwise we can only continue to fight. But from now on, our fight is not only to maintain our own position, but also to put pressure on the Japanese so that they cannot withdraw their troops to engage in the southern advance.

Final Victory is Guaranteed

When China engaged in the war of resistance, it encountered two major problems: a lack of money and a lack of aircraft. In the three years of destructive war, its most prosperous industrial areas were either destroyed by artillery fire or looted. Most of its transportation has been cut off, yet China still has to support millions of soldiers and guerrillas. The foreign exchange rate of China's legal tender has fallen to one-fifth of the pre-war exchange rate, while its domestic price has risen six times. Fortunately, Britain and the United States lent a helping hand in this difficult time, lending huge sums of money. According to someone who recently came here from China, when Roosevelt announced that he would lend 100 million yuan to China, the reaction was like lightning. The suffering and depressed Chinese people were greatly excited after hearing this news, and the hope of final victory was once again guaranteed.

The People are Severely Poisoned by the Japanese

The world is familiar with the horror caused by indiscriminate bombing of British cities, towns, and villages, but at the very least, Britain still has anti-aircraft guns, air defense balloons, fighter planes, and bombers to defend it and retaliate. However, the situation in China is completely different. Japanese planes can fly freely over the skies of our cities and villages, selecting targets for bombing, without encountering any danger of retaliation. For example, during the mad bombing of Chongqing by Japanese planes on May 3rd and 4th, 1939, the number of civilians killed, injured, and burned to death reached 30,000. This number is more than the total number of people who died in the bombardment of London in the past six months. Japan is a master of abusing terms. When millions of Japanese soldiers are either dead or injured, and millions of Japanese soldiers are fighting, they still claim that the war in China is only an incident.

China Will Not Fail in its Mission to the United States

In this world war, the United States may never become a belligerent country, but regardless of whether Americans want to hear this, we will still regard ourselves as allies of the United States. Guarding the fortress in the Pacific for the country. Since I came to the United States, I have deeply felt the friendliness of the American people. I believe that the friendship of the American people towards the Chinese is not entirely out of sympathy for the victims of aggression, nor is it merely a recognition of the results of our heroic defense. I think there are still other reasons that make Americans friendly to us, that is, you have a deeply rooted instinct in your hearts, believing that you can trust a great nation to prevent the scourge of war from approaching your country. If this great nation can survive through the difficulties, it will join hands with you to enable your descendants to live safely in the Pacific region. With God's blessing and your assistance, we will surely not fail in our mission. (The End)

The Problem of the "Special Police" Organization is Being Addressed with Both Hands, First Discussing Uniforms and Police Station Locations, and a Final Decision is Expected Within the Month

According to news obtained yesterday, "Special Police Chief" Pan Zhijie and "Deputy Chief" Kelisha, recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council, have begun to negotiate the details of the "Special Police" organization. These negotiations are expected to reach a final decision on March 1st. Although the "Municipal Government" has not yet "approved" Kelisha as "Deputy Chief," this "acceptance" is only a "routine matter." Once Chen Gongbo returns to Shanghai, he can officially "accept." According to a police spokesperson, although Chen Gongbo is not in Shanghai, it has no impact on the current stage of negotiations. Once the agreement is signed by both parties, the remaining issues, such as uniforms, police station locations, etc., can be carried out by Pan Zhijie and Kelisha before the "Special Police" are formally established. As for the issue of micro-taxes on roads built beyond the boundaries, it remains a mystery. Although a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council claimed that the two parties would soon begin negotiations on the issue, he refused to make detailed comments on the matter.

Tax Revenue Issues Not Yet Resolved

(13th) Morning According to well-informed sources, Chen Gongbo will return to Shanghai from Ningbo early next week, which is expected to allow negotiations on the establishment of the new police force in the Joint District of Western Shanghai to continue to progress. An official of the Shanghai Municipal Council stated yesterday morning that the issue of tax collection in the Joint District has not yet been resolved, but the two parties will soon discuss this issue to continue the talks that were previously held, it is believed that an independent tax bureau will be set up in the Joint District to collect taxes in the area, it is heard that the collected funds will be used exclusively to maintain the new police force and public services in the area.

Hopes to Extend Control Over Water and Electricity in the Western District

Residents of roads built beyond the boundaries in Western Shanghai have been paying taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council and obtaining the use of water and electricity. The electricity in the area is supplied by the American-owned Shanghai Western Electric Company. Since 1935, the company has had the exclusive right to supply electricity to the area for thirty years. Recently, since the establishment of the Western Shanghai Police Authority Agreement on February 1st, the Japanese side has recognized that the area is in fact under the jurisdiction of the "Municipal Government." Although the issue of taxation has not yet been resolved, the Japanese side's attempt to seize the water and electricity rights in the area is already evident in Japanese newspapers. According to the Continental News, which was published yesterday, on the one hand, it is inciting residents of the area to resist taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and on the other hand, it is instigating the municipal authorities to have the water and electricity in the area supplied by the China Central Water and Electricity Company.

### Consular Court Will Continue to Hear the Fangdan Land Tax Case, Plaintiff Wants to Present Reasons Based on Law, But Bolliang Believes it "Hinders Tax Revenue"

Regarding the case of Chinese landowners Fang Jiahe, Hu Jingfang, Zhu Ruiqing, Wen De, and others suing the Shanghai Municipal Council for collecting Fangdan land tax in the Consular Court, according to Langge, secretary of the Consular Corps, the hearing has been scheduled to continue on Tuesday (18th) or Wednesday (19th). According to the previous trials of the case, the plaintiffs' lawyer Liu Shifang and the Shanghai Municipal Council's lawyer Bolliang had fierce debates. The reasons held by the plaintiff are based on the land charter and the judgment of the First Special District Court, which states that Fangdan holders can be exempted from paying donations. The Shanghai Municipal Council itself is restricted by the charter and has no reason to violate the regulations and collect Fangdan land tax. On the defendant's side, it firmly stated that those who hindered the Shanghai Municipal Council from collecting donations were the Chinese authorities, the court, and the taxpayers' association. Bolliang also stated that at the next hearing, he would be able to present evidence to prove that the judgment of the First Special District Court was the result of "political pressure." He is determined to fight for the final victory in the century-old war between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the taxpayers, so it is expected that there will still be a fierce debate at the next hearing.

Prices had already broken through the $6,400 barrier, and after the evening session, off-exchange trading further retreated to below $6,300. All parties felt extremely weary. There were widespread rumors that Britain and America would successively evacuate their overseas Chinese in the Far East, and further rumors that a certain country's plainclothes troops had infiltrated Singapore, launching a southward advance, among other things. Moreover, today afternoon (1:00 PM to 2:00 PM) is the swap date for February rolling into March.

Although Da Feng, along with the securities firms and Xin Feng Yong, had initially tried to push the price up from $6,380 to $6,455, midway, at noon, suddenly, acting on behalf of the Tianjin firms, they re-emerged as sellers, and the falling trend resumed.

Chaotic Drop of $160

Upon hearing the news, a widespread selling frenzy ensued, with Ming Feng, Ren Cheng Yong, and Chi Da among the most aggressive sellers. The price gradually declined, eventually falling below the $6,400 barrier, reaching $6,380. At this time, the foreign exchange market also reported easing conditions, and negative news continued to pour in.

Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange rate eased again, and Ren Cheng Yong and others stirred up another buying frenzy. Buyers were extremely scarce, and amid a wide disparity between supply and demand, it plummeted to $6,335.

### Foodstuffs: Rice Prices Attempt to Rise, Fortunately Receding After a Single Surge

After continuous days of decline, foreign rice prices suddenly rebounded yesterday. The reason was that sellers, seeing that various commodities had depreciated in recent days, by $13, collectively and firmly defended their positions to protect their capital. General customers also needed to replenish their stocks after several days of observation. Seeing that various commodities had repeatedly declined, and that the price difference between the first-grade rice and the lower-grade rice had narrowed, it was worthwhile to purchase. Therefore, they all took advantage of the low prices to buy, so the morning market was quite active. Later, rural customers and general speculative individuals followed suit.

### Overseas Chinese Education in Honolulu (II)

Among the overseas Chinese schools in Honolulu, many have requested subsidies from the central government. Any such subsidies should be used to increase teachers' salaries to solve this problem. The second problem is that some overseas Chinese schools use the Hakka dialect for teaching, and the teaching materials are not standardized. In the spring of 1938, Mrs. Zhao Yuanren and her daughter, Miss Zhao Rulan, opened a Chinese Mandarin supplementary school in Honolulu. This school uses phonetic symbols as a teaching tool, and the students are of all ages. However, they made great progress in a short period of time. Mrs. Han Qianghua, who succeeded Zhao, also worked hard. It seems that the Hakka dialect teaching will completely disappear in the near future under the influence of the promotion of Mandarin. As for unified teaching materials, we still need the education administration to impose stricter regulations to achieve faster results.

The University of Hawaii is the highest institution of learning in Honolulu. The Department of Chinese Language was established in 1935, which is the only place for overseas Chinese in our land to study the culture and academics of the motherland. The department offers many courses related to Sinology, such as (1) History of Chinese Cultural Contact, (2) Ancient Chinese History, (3) History of Chinese Culture, (4) Sinological Bibliography and Research Methods, (5) Chinese History, (6) Chinese Literature, (7) Chinese Literature in English Literature, (8) Chinese Philosophy and Art, (9) History of Chinese Music and Its Appreciation, (10) Chinese Philology, (11) Intensive Chinese, (12) Taoism, (13) Chinese Philosophy, (14) Oriental Philosophy and other courses. Many overseas Chinese students study in the college and are very interested in achieving great results. Before the establishment of a self-run higher overseas Chinese school (i.e., a school above the junior college level) in Honolulu, the Department of Chinese Language of the Oriental Institute has benefited the overseas Chinese students in studying our country's inherent culture. However, the current problem is how to communicate with domestic higher education and academic research institutions through the Chinese Department of the Oriental Institute of the University of Hawaii. In peacetime, we must fully play the function of communication, and in special times, the government of our country may allocate special funds to set up lectures in the college to promote the culture and academics of the motherland so that the overseas Chinese students will benefit more. In general, the education of overseas Chinese in Honolulu is still in the development stage. Both the quantity and the substance are not ideal, and it needs to be improved. In the past ten years, in Honolulu, in addition to the five overseas Chinese schools that have been approved or filed by the Ministry of Education and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, as well as one or two overseas Chinese education talks and student achievement competitions presided over by the Consul of Honolulu, local overseas Chinese education institutions and people have had very little contact with domestic education administrative agencies. Contact should be promoted in many ways to make it gradually closer. Then, the improvement and enrichment of teachers, equipment, and teaching materials in overseas Chinese schools will be solved easily. Honolulu is a paradise in the Pacific Ocean with a beautiful environment. The overseas Chinese in the land have already been blessed with material wealth. If they can be given education, today's overseas Chinese students will be the mainstay of the future overseas Chinese community, and their contribution to the motherland will be even greater. In this process of resistance and construction, I hope that the famous people at home and abroad will pay attention to it. (End)

### Destroy It While It's a Snake

— Jue Hui

I remember many similar stories in "Stories":

"A person finds a small mouse in the house and doesn't care.

Later, the little mouse becomes a big mouse, and he still doesn't care.

Later, it becomes many big mice, and he still doesn't care.

Later, the mice bite things and hurt toes, then he jumps up; but it's too late!"

Originally, "Small negligence leads to big trouble," and "Carelessness" naturally leads to "losing Jingzhou."

However, now there are too many knowingly wrong "bright-eyed blind people" who are committing crimes. The "vocal cords" are not broken, but they pretend to be dumb first: "I won't speak!" If a handgun is found on a public bus, wouldn't everyone be willing to go "into luggage" as suspects?

Everyone pretends to "not see," "not speak," and then "not move"...

"Destroy it while it's a snake, what will you do when it becomes a serpent?" We've seen robberies on the bus.

### A Record of Collecting Tuition Fees

— Gao Yang

Mr. Principal rushed in, saying that the bank had called and asked someone to quickly help collect tuition fees; otherwise, they wouldn't accept them, and the bank was full of people paying fees, and they had no way to handle it. So, under the direction of Mr. Principal, I immediately rushed to the bank.

The bank was packed with people; those who couldn't get inside could only stand on the sidewalk by the door, looking like they were selling square meters. So I had no choice but to be "blocked."

With great difficulty, I squeezed in, but as a "bumpkin," I couldn't find a way to the counter, so I had to ask the police officer to take me. But this gentleman first scanned me from head to toe with lightning-like eyes, then aggressively asked me what I was doing. I said I was there to collect fees, and he became even more suspicious. After questioning the people inside, it seemed that he confirmed my identity as Mr. Gao from a certain school, who was indeed there to collect fees. Only then did that police officer allow me to enter a side door locked with a DAMM tumbler lock.

I don't know if it was my own psychological effect, or if the bank employees hadn't seen poor people before, but as soon as I stepped into the copper railing, dozens of eyes accustomed to seeing banknotes stared straight at me, emitting a particularly powerful glow.

When I walked into the small room in the back designated by Mr. Manager, I felt strange, "Does a bank also have a kitchen?"...

But as I was thinking about it, before my feet had completely crossed the threshold of the small room, a not-so-low question came from behind me—"Is this kind of person here to help collect fees?"

I turned around and noticed an elderly girl asking a male employee. Her face was made up a bit comically, almost like a "beautiful and moving" actress after makeup. So I wanted to take another look at her, but it was terrible. Not only was she not embarrassed, but she became even fiercer than me. Her eyebrows, like two lines, drooped, and her eyes, as big as longan beads, glared at me. This made me scared, "Will I offend the gods today?" I secretly worried. At the same time, I blamed myself for wearing this unlucky yellow and gray coat, asking for trouble.

Walking into the back room, parents were already gathered there. Because my job was to find receipts, it was the first hurdle. Without it, the bank employees couldn't collect fees. So the parents surged into the room, almost suffocating me. People climbed on top of each other, standing very high. I had no choice but to announce a "suspension of distribution" to coerce them. If they didn't back out, I wouldn't issue them. Finally, this condition was met, and I could continue.

Slowly, things got on track, and the crowding gradually shifted from our side to the counter. The place for paying money became lively—many hands pulled on the copper railing, so tired that the steadily lying bronze railing also creaked, and even the loud voices of the tellers were drowned out by the crowd outside today.

One parent muttered to himself: "Giving them money, and they still pretend to be stupid and put on airs!" He turned around and asked me why the school wasn't collecting fees itself this year. I told him, "It's inconvenient!"

It was almost time for lunch, and the crowd gradually thinned. Only then did I realize that four children were still waiting there. I asked them, and they said that someone had paid their tuition on their behalf, took the money, and hadn't paid it yet. Actually, this guy had already "slipped away." At this time, the children realized they had been cheated, and they started crying loudly, but it was useless; the money couldn't be cried back!

The clock pointed to two o'clock, and the crowd began to surge again. Some people were arguing, saying they had overpaid tuition, and others were dripping with sweat, unable to speak, only hot steam rising into the air; still others said their pockets had been picked. It became lively again.

After four o'clock, the bank pulled down the iron gate, and the employees felt happy—they could finally breathe a sigh of relief.

For the sake of children's education, how many people are busy. This kind of fee collection will have to be done for several more days, but I can't guess how many more times it will be collected in the future?

### Begonia

— Qin Shouhe

He and Principal Hou were cousins ​​and shared common interests, so of course there was nothing they couldn't talk about. That night, Director Ma invited Principal Hou to his home to discuss how to carry out the matter. Director Ma's wife was also specially invited to attend.

Director Ma first told Principal Hou the details of the meeting at the Governor's Office just now. Only because he was eager to see the matter succeed, he did not mention his doubts about whether Yuan Baofan had married, and even deliberately helped Yuan Baofan explain a few words, so as to dispel the suspicion of his fifty-three-year-old cousin.

"Things are very good." Mrs. Ma echoed her husband's words: "It's enough for a female student to marry a garrison commander!"

A thin smile appeared on Principal Hou's gaunt face, which resembled a dried tangerine.

"Yes, things are very good." She habitually said in a very low voice: "Last month, Luo Xiangqi's father also wrote a letter asking me to find a position for Xiangqi after graduation, or to stay at the alma mater and do some work, just hoping to still provide food and accommodation, nothing else. Because this old man has been unemployed for three years, and his son is suffering from lung disease and is recuperating at a relative's home in Hangzhou, the family is in very difficult circumstances..."

"Then this matter is easy to discuss!" Director Ma excitedly interjected.

"The problem is not with her family, but with herself." Principal Hou shook her head and said, "Because this girl has a very gentle appearance but a very proud heart. A few days ago, I found her a tutoring job, with a salary of thirty yuan a month, but she insisted on not doing it, saying that she didn't want to serve the children of rich families; she only hoped to be a primary school teacher, earn a few dollars to help her father, and after her father had a job or her brother recovered, she still wanted to save some money herself to continue her studies. So if you directly discuss this matter with her, I think it's unlikely to succeed." (30)

### Eating Apprentice's Rice

— Nai Liu

After becoming an apprentice, of course, you want to have a bowl of rice to eat at your master's place in the future. Logically, we should say eating "master's rice" or "father's rice." But no, although there are those who eat "master's rice" and "father's rice," the black-hearted masters who "eat apprentice's rice" are even more numerous.

Ordinarily, when you are an apprentice, you finish your apprenticeship in three years. During these three years, you listen to the master's commands: old-fashioned shop apprentices serve the masters, sweep the floor, and do errands. This is a traditional custom; apprentices learning a craft have to cook and wash vegetables. Although these are not explicitly stipulated, if you don't do these, you will get "reheated tofu skin," without a doubt.

Now rice is expensive, and it's really unaffordable to raise an apprentice, but hiring a guest teacher or master, the salary and meals are even more considerable. If the shop wants to hire a maid, that's even more obvious. Compared to that, taking in apprentices is really the cheapest thing. Black-hearted masters see it this way, so they generously take in apprentices; but on the other hand, they shatter the rice bowls of guest masters. Apprentices are taken in, and because they are there to learn, they naturally don't get any salary. Saying things like shoe money and haircut money, those are really paltry amounts.

Therefore, some small craft shops use a master's wife, a master, and an apprentice to fill the space. If the master's wife can do some work, that's of course a good thing, but nine out of ten master's wives like to put on airs, so the apprentice has to act as a "big-footed nanny." Furthermore, this puts a distance between them and learning the craft. The masters are so smart; they explain this kind of thing in a tactful way: "Endure hardship to be above others!" At the same time, they are used to saying, "Wasn't that how we masters started? Honestly, if you don't suffer this kind of hardship, you won't want to improve."

Then there are other "apprentice rice eaters." They think that three years of apprenticeship is still too short (actually, for real skill learning, it only takes about a year to train very well), so they add it to five years (that's how silk floss is turned now). During these five years, even if the apprentice quickly learns the skills of the trade, they won't get even a small wage; in the end, they just help the master earn more money. After five years, if the apprentice can't find a place to go, and they still work under the master, then the wages they earn as apprentices are subject to things like "four-six split." The master, who doesn't lift a finger, gets the big share.

Although there are now interns and work-study students, etc., in Shanghai, where life is like a ten-layer cake, "eating apprentice's rice" still occupies a thick layer!

### A Day in the Life of Li Qinian

— Yong Zi

If it wasn't a night shoot the day before, Miss Li Qinian would definitely get up very early. Although the environment of Yihua Company is not a place with beautiful mountains and clear waters, it is spacious and sparsely populated, and the air is very fresh. She has to play here for a while every day on the open space, such as jumping, skipping rope, running, and riding a bicycle. Back in the house, the old nanny she brought from Hong Kong has prepared a cup of hot milk for her. Sometimes, there are also fresh eggs and fruits, but her breakfast is very simple, almost always a cup of milk and a few biscuits.

After breakfast, she begins to sort out the letters from fans sent by the tea boy in the morning. These letters are of all kinds of natures. Most of them are letters asking for photos, and some are asking about her new works. Once she opened a letter and saw the words "I want to commit suicide" glaring at her, which startled Miss Li. Looking down, she saw the words "If you don't send me a photo" written below.

From many letters, she selects about ten and answers them herself. The rest are written by her secretary, Miss Chen Fengming, according to Miss Li's intentions, and then she signs her name. Dealing with these fans' letters takes her about two hours a day.

Reading the newspaper is one of her main tasks every morning. She subscribes to the Shen Bao herself, and the rest of the newspapers are borrowed from the propaganda department, because the propaganda department has marked all the movie-related texts in the newspaper, so she can save a lot of valuable time.

After reading the newspaper, she rereads her script. At this time, she refuses to see guests, because she believes that this is an important preparation for her to improve, and she must devote herself to it, and no circumstances should hinder her from doing so at this time.

If there are no guests, she eats lunch with her secretary, etc. If there are guests, the dishes are more abundant. About three days a week, she still eats purely Cantonese-style dishes. Her nanny can cook very good Cantonese food, and sometimes colleagues come to her place to eat real Cantonese food or Cantonese soup.

After lunch, she rests for a while and reads books, or reads the second batch of letters every day. Sometimes she also chats with her colleagues about the sea and the sky. At this time, she will laugh and giggle like a child, without any hypocrisy.

Usually, filming always starts in the afternoon, so when it comes to filming days, she dresses up on time and reports to the set on time. She believes that being late is a disgrace to civilized people, so she advises others to be punctual, and she herself never misses a point. This is worth mentioning.

On the set, she obeys the director's instructions and also humbly accepts teaching. Sometimes she occasionally raises questions to discuss with the director, which are also well-organized and do not make affirmative statements.

If there is no filming in the afternoon, she reads books in her own house. Now she has hired a female singing teacher and a Cantonese opera musician, because she is not only a movie star, but also a red singer in the Southern Opera world. However, after coming to Shanghai, she has almost neglected Cantonese opera due to various private affairs, so now she spends at least one hour a day reviewing various Cantonese operas. If she has the opportunity in the future, she may perform on stage in Shanghai.

Sometimes she goes out to watch movies or Peking opera. As for dance halls, she says she doesn't like them, so she rarely goes. Usually, after eating dinner, she reads books and newspapers, finishes writing the diary of the day, and goes to bed at about ten o'clock.

However, the life of a film person is often entangled in work and lacks order. For example, filming all night and sleeping during the day, etc. The description of Miss Li's daily life written above refers to days when there is not much filming. Recently, she is filming "The Merry Widow," so she has to adapt her life to the work.

### My Views on Xun Huisheng

— Jing Ying

Xun's strength lies in having drama in her heart. Every word and every note is full of drama. Every move has meaning. Although her voice is not as good as Mei, Cheng, and Shang, her skill surpasses them. Therefore, in the "Five Flower Caves," which was jointly recorded by the four famous female roles, Xun's voice and singing are not weaker than Mei and are even better than Shang and Cheng. Her spoken parts are better because of her soft and sweet voice. Her tone is euphemistic and has a unique charm. The (sniffing and sad chanting…) Southern Bangzi in "Returning the Pearl"; the (for someone else) Siping Melody in "A Dream of Red Mansions"; the Xipi Yuan Ban in "Jealous Woman's Tips" (saw on the east wall); the Er Liu in "Hairpin Phoenix" (see you (record)), listening to it can make people intoxicated and fascinated. In the last ten years, her tragic melodies have been particularly moving. For example, the Erhuang Sanban in "Fragrant Silk Ribbon"; and the dying Kuai Sanyan in "Hairpin Phoenix," listening to it brings sadness and makes people cry, so it's no wonder that when Xun performs this, many female guests in the audience have red eyes and wet handkerchiefs. One night, I played the "Mu Kezhai" records of Mei and Xun twice each and listened carefully. I felt that Mei's spoken parts were rich in tonal brilliance, while Xun's spoken parts were full of dramatic emotion. Mei is blessed by nature, while Xun has superb skills. Closing my eyes and listening to Xun's spoken parts, it's as if it's the voice and tone of a little girl, which is something that Mei lacks. Mei has a rich and grand style, while Shang excels in boldness; Cheng's cold and enchanting style is difficult for other female roles to learn; Xun's charming, enchanting, tragic, and humorous style is not the forte of Mei, Shang, and Cheng. Mei has "Farewell My Concubine," Cheng has "Nie Yinniang," and Shang has "Lin Si Niang" in sword dance, Xun, although she doesn't have these, can tread on high-soled shoes. Mei's tragedy is like "Life and Death Hate," Cheng's tragedy is like "Green Frost Sword" and "Green Jade Hairpin," and Shang's "Pearl Fan" all tell about the affairs between husband and wife, while Xun's tragedy is mostly biased towards romantic debts. If Xun weren't a "wise" and "great" person, how could she achieve this?

Some people criticize Hui Sheng for not singing Fan Erhuang when singing the "Jade Hall Spring" escort scene, saying that Hui Sheng is not good at singing against the melody. In fact, Xun's Qingyi foundation is not as good as Mei, Cheng, and Shang. How could she not sing against the melody? In my section "Jingchai Ji," I sang a section of the Spirit and saved it by singing against the melody. (The End)

New Film Introduction

### Nightingale and Butterfly Love

— Huang Xinde

A film like "Nightingale and Butterfly Love," just looking at the title, seems to be worth watching, especially since the leading actors are Bing Crosby, Mary Martin, and Basil Rathbone. However, after watching it, it is inevitable to be disappointed. Perhaps people who like to listen to singing films will be satisfied, because there are "seven famous songs" in the film. However, in my opinion, calling it a movie is ultimately not a news film!

What is the story of "Nightingale and Butterfly Love"? It seems to satirize the shamelessness of a famous composer, because all his works are ghostwritten by unknown writers. These unknown writers are Bing Crosby and Mary Martin, and that famous person, without a doubt, is Basil Rathbone.

For such a plot, what we should see on the screen is how Basil Rathbone deceives the public, how he oppresses unknown people, and how unknown people struggle hard and then achieve success. However, the screenwriter is determined to turn this play into a comedy, but turns the character of Bing Crosby into a philandering playboy. For example, in the first half, when Bing Crosby first meets Mary Martin in the apartment, his appearance really makes people feel bad. And the "stalking" section later on the train is not clever either. The director's technique can only be said to be mediocre, and in some places, it is still muddled and cannot give the audience a clear concept.

As for the acting skills of each person, Bing Crosby originally couldn't act, and it is undoubtedly "beyond his ability" to play such an important role. Mary Martin is better, but there is nothing outstanding about her. Basil Rathbone is really wasted in this film. Not only does he not have any scenes to do, but the personality of this role is not very suitable either.

### Li Amao's Hygiene Mailbox

(Mr. Hua Nan Zheng asks) I work in a factory, and there are no female employees in the factory; but every night after sleeping, my genitals must act strangely. Is there any good method?

(Answer) Remove desires, do appropriate exercise, read more self-cultivation texts, and do not make bad friends.

(Mr. Peng Kan Zhi asks) There is a lot of white dandruff on my head, and it is very itchy. It has been like this for more than three years. What kind of disease is this, and how to treat it?

(Answer) It is probably ringworm. Wash it with medicated soap and then rub it with Jiufu Company's Bailing Oil.

(Mr. Yao Ming asks) Every night after sleeping, I must talk in my sleep. Is there a way to prevent this?

(Answer) This is because the brain cannot rest sufficiently. It is best to rinse your mouth and brush your teeth before going to bed; and do not eat too much for dinner.
