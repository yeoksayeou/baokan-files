### Declaration of Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi: China Severing Diplomatic Relations with Germany and Italy; Striving to Uphold International Integrity within the Anti-Aggression Bloc; Henceforth, Utmost Cooperation with Allied Nations to Continue the Struggle

Chongqing - Declaration by the Foreign Minister: The governments of Germany and Italy have actually recognized the Nanjing organization. This is an obvious extension of their policy of aggression to the Far East and also fully proves that Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy have joined forces with those who are aggressing against China. The governments of the two countries, knowing full well that the Nanjing organization was created single-handedly by Japan, have actually recognized it. This is a great insult to China and they do not hesitate to abandon all the friendship they enjoyed with the Chinese government and people. This move by the Axis powers further confirms that the evil forces of world aggression have formed a bloc dedicated to destroying human freedom and civilization. Fortunately, countries that love peace and freedom are increasing in number and strength in their heroic and steadfast resistance to this evil force in the world, and their cooperation is becoming closer. China, within this anti-aggression bloc, can be worthy of its position and contribution. Even in this unprecedented difficult time, our consistent efforts to maintain international integrity are beyond reproach. Henceforth, we must cooperate with all friendly countries as much as possible to continue the struggle, so as to eventually achieve our common mission. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated its attitude towards any country recognizing the Nanjing organization. Now, we officially declare that China is severing diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy. July 2, the thirtieth year of the Republic of China.

Chongqing - Shao Yulin, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, invited reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers in Chongqing at 8:00 PM on the 2nd to read Foreign Minister Guo's official declaration regarding the German and Italian governments' recognition of the Nanjing organization. After reading the declaration, Shao stated that the Chinese government's attitude towards the German and Italian recognition of the Nanjing organization has been fully expressed in Foreign Minister Guo's declaration, and he does not wish to and does not need to add any further comments. As for this declaration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent it to the German and Italian embassies in Chongqing, specifically appointing Secretary Ling Qihan of the ministry to deliver it, carrying passports for the departure of personnel from those embassies. This note was delivered in person to Mr. Nolde, the secretary of the German embassy, and Mr. Shi Bingnai, the acting representative of Italy, informing them that the Chinese government has decided to provide all possible convenience for the evacuation of the two embassies. The evacuation route seems to be escorted by the Chinese government to the Guangxi-Vietnam border. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also notified the Garrison Headquarters and the Chongqing Municipal Government to dispatch more police and soldiers to provide effective protection to the two embassies before their evacuation. Regarding general German and Italian nationals, orders have also been issued to local authorities to provide protection. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed orders for the evacuation of Chinese embassy personnel in Germany and Italy. As for the issue of Chinese nationals in Germany and Italy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is consulting with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Education.

Chongqing - China officially severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy today, demanding that diplomatic representatives of the Axis powers here leave Chongqing as soon as possible, and accusing the Axis of extending their aggressive policies to the Far East. Ling Qihan, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, delivered the proclamation issued by the newly appointed Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi at 8:00 PM this afternoon to the German and Italian embassies, severing diplomatic relations. The staff of the German and Italian embassies here have received their diplomatic passports and have been guaranteed safe passage to the Guangxi-Vietnam border. (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)

Chongqing - After the Axis powers recognized the Nanjing regime of Wang Jingwei, the Chinese government has completely severed relations with Germany and Italy today. The diplomats affected by the severing of relations are Chen Jie, the Chinese ambassador to Germany, Xu Daolin, the acting representative to Italy, Mr. Plasen, the German chargé d'affaires in China, and Mr. Gallo, the counsellor of the Italian embassy. Chen Jie has been stationed in Berlin since presenting his credentials to Hitler in 1939. Liu Wendao, the Chinese ambassador to Italy, returned to China in 1938. Germany has not appointed an ambassador to China since recalling its former ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann, from Hankou in 1938. Italian Ambassador to China, Daliani, has never presented his credentials to the Chongqing government. (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)

Chongqing - Regarding the recognition of the Nanjing organization by Germany and Italy, the Chinese government has received a report from the embassy in Berlin, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a statement as soon as it receives the official content of the document. The government does not attach much importance to this matter itself, as it is only a minor issue in the Sino-Japanese War. However, since Germany and Italy have taken such an unfriendly action, the Chinese government cannot but express its stance. According to an observation by a veteran in diplomatic circles, China is bound to sever diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy, and it is believed that the recognition by Germany and Italy must have involved an exchange of conditions. In other words, Japan should now agree to assist Germany in attacking the Soviet Union. However, one well-informed source said that this move has a promoting effect, but it is too early to say that Japan will immediately attack the Soviet Union. The recognition of Nanjing by Germany and Italy had long been agreed upon, but Japan itself delayed for too long before granting recognition, so Germany and Italy also procrastinated. Now that it has been decided to cultivate the Nanjing side, such as lending 300 million yen, Germany and Italy have been asked to fulfill their promises. Germany and Italy also have certain expectations, so this move was promoted. However, as a result of this evolution, Japan cannot but take action for Germany and Italy. According to intelligence received by a military agency, Japanese transport ships from Hainan Island and the navy in Taiwan have been transferred north, and some bases in South China will be abandoned. They firmly believe that Japan's attack on the Soviet Union is imminent. (Havas dispatch on the 1st)

Chongqing - Regarding the issue of Germany and Italy recognizing the Nanjing organization, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that a statement would not be issued until midnight. It is reported that the wording condemning Germany and Italy is extremely harsh. However, there are many concerns about overseas Chinese in Germany and Italy regarding future practical steps after the outbreak of the European war. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already telegraphed orders to the ambassador in Berlin and the representative in Rome, ordering them to immediately evacuate with all embassy and consular staff. At the same time, it is forbidden for the Huitong News Agency to publish manuscripts here. (Havas dispatch on the 1st)

Washington - Chinese Ambassador Hu Shi commented on the Axis powers' recognition of the Nanjing organization, saying that this move is sufficient to show the Axis countries giving Japan this difficult matter. From the Japanese side, after the last establishment of the Nanjing organization, it was originally hoped that the Axis would immediately recognize it, so this matter is actually too late. (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)

Geneva - It is reported that all personnel from the Chinese embassies in Germany and Italy intend to withdraw to Switzerland. (Electric dispatch on the 1st)

No Change in Sino-American Relations

Washington - Undersecretary of State Welles declared here last night that the Axis powers' recognition of Nanjing will not affect American policy. The United States will continue to recognize Chongqing as the only legitimate government of China. There are various indications here that the United States is not paying attention to this move by the Axis powers, but rather sees it as an attempt by the Axis powers to appease Japan and maintain friendly relations with the Axis. Observers believe that the Axis powers' recognition of Wang Jingwei at this time reflects the Axis powers' deep concern that Japan's pro-Axis sentiment is wavering, so they decided to assist Japan diplomatically to "maintain its position" as much as possible. (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)

Washington - Assistant Secretary of State Welles stated last night that the official recognition of Nanjing by Germany and Italy does not cause the United States to change its relations with China and Japan in the slightest. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)

Washington - According to diplomatic sources here, the Axis powers' simultaneous recognition of Nanjing is intended to strengthen the power of pro-German elements in Japan in order to implement the war against the Soviet Union by assisting Germany. In reality, it is nothing more than a "war of nerves." It is believed that the United States' Far East policy will never change, and there is absolutely no prospect of recognizing Nanjing.

### Fujian Province Adjusts Grain Management Agencies; Military Grain Transportation and Sales Handled by the Provincial Grain Administration Bureau; Grain Adjustment in Various Counties by the County Public G沽 Bureau

Yongan - Fujian's grain management methods and business institutions are striving for improvement. Recently, the provincial capital made changes. In the past, the supply and adjustment of grain in various provinces was uniformly managed by the Provincial Grain Administration Bureau and the Public G沽 General Management Office. Now, in order to save expenses and seek simplicity, the Public G沽 General Management Office has been abolished from the first of this month. Grain supply in various counties has been transferred to the direct management of the County Public G沽 Bureau. In addition, a business office has been established in the Provincial Grain Administration Bureau to specialize in the transportation and sale of military grain and the supply and demand allocation of grain between provinces. The Public G沽 Bureaus of 22 counties, including southern Fujian's Qujiang, Nan'an, and Longxi, are also temporarily abolished due to limited manpower and financial resources. Efforts are first concentrated on the adjustment of grain in northwestern Fujian. As for the surplus and shortage of grain in various counties in northwestern Fujian, the provincial government has established temporary adjustment measures, dividing the counties in northwestern Fujian into four areas: supply, demand, self-sufficiency, and military grain. Before the autumn harvest, accurate estimates of the actual output are made separately, and the quantities to be supplied by each supply area and military grain area are stipulated. In addition, a small amount of grain within the province has been allowed to circulate freely in order to achieve natural adjustment. After the implementation of these measures, the people's food supply in Yong'an and Bianping and other places is abundant, purchases are convenient, and prices are also low. Yong'an is one catty per yuan, Nanping is one catty and two taels, while in rice-producing counties in northern Fujian such as Shaowu, Chongan, and Pucheng, three to five catties can still be purchased per yuan, and the amount of civilian storage is sufficient.

Editorial

### Analysis of Japan's Movements

The first reflection of the Soviet-German war in the Far East was that China's diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy fell into a state that was difficult to maintain. This was not surprising at a time when international divisions were becoming increasingly clear and the Axis powers were eager to obtain foreign aid. Apart from this, the one that appears to be inactive on the surface, but is brewing in extreme anxiety internally, is none other than Japan today.

Speaking solely from the corner of the Far East, Japan does seem to have some initiative, but in the broader international arena, it only has passivity. The progress and retreat of its foreign relations is therefore because, in the past few years, Japanese politicians and diplomats have only been following the development of international politics step by step, trying their best to catch up. By the time they have achieved something through some operation and effort, the international situation has already changed, and as a result, everything needs to be re-examined. In the past three or four years, this situation has been seen once in the dispatch of Terauchi Daisaku to Europe to prepare for strengthening the Tripartite Pact, again in the conclusion of the Tripartite Alliance last autumn, and three times in the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact not long ago. All of these have not only failed to achieve the desired effect, but have also caused countless new confusions and disturbances. After the failure of the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations recently, the next step is still hesitant, and the sudden outbreak of unexpected war between the Soviet Union and Germany. This situation, even the Japanese themselves do not deny that it is an extremely difficult juncture.

The policy of advancing south and defending north has been the consistent advocacy of Japanese radicals since the outbreak of the European war. However, in fact, the advance south was delayed due to insufficient preparation, and the defense north was repeatedly delayed. It was not until Matsuoka's visit to Europe in April that the guarantee of neutrality with the Soviet Union was obtained. However, the Soviet-Japanese treaty was mainly initiated by the Soviet side. When the Japanese were complacent that they could let go and cross south, the Soviet-German war was already 80% mature. Hitler only waited for Greece to be included in the bag and would launch a large-scale attack on the Soviet Union, but Japan guaranteed the Soviet Union's neutrality when the Soviet Union was at war with a third country. The conflict between the Tripartite Alliance and the Neutrality Pact already existed at that time, but it was not until the actual outbreak of war between the Soviet Union and Germany that it was felt to be a problem.

However, at this time, the Nazi leadership is not concerned with these past grievances, but only with current practical benefits. Its recent measures towards Japan are clearly concessions to seek favor in order to win them over so that Japan will be directed to achieve the effect of encircling the Soviet Union. In Japan, the voice for advancing north has recently revived, and anti-American sentiment has become anti-Soviet sentiment. If the Soviet army unfortunately suffers defeat against Germany, the scene of sending troops to Siberia will inevitably be re-enacted. What's more, its vigilance against the Soviet Union has never been relaxed, and the strategic deployment for advancing north has already been completed, and it can be launched at any time. Everything is more convenient than attacking the United States by advancing south. However, Japan's current situation does not allow it to further consider this. First, the development of the international situation in recent times is almost entirely outside the scope that the Japanese authorities can grasp. After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Japanese side was full of disputes, discussing for ten days before making a decision, but it was still only vague and wait-and-see. Moreover, the saying that the cabinet will be reorganized is again noisy, which is enough to show that the degree of confusion of its authorities is almost the same as when the Soviet Union and Germany concluded the Non-Aggression Pact. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to take decisive action. Second, a country can only have one definite basic national policy within a certain period of time. If it continues to waver and change repeatedly, it will inevitably make the people feel at a loss, thereby greatly reducing its strength. Its continuous wavering between invading China and advancing south and north for more than a year is enough to make it unable to complete any goal. Third, the relationship between Japan and Germany recently is far less harmonious than in a certain period in the past. Under the rapid progress of the German army, whether it will eventually develop to the Far East is a problem that the Japanese side is extremely worried about. The signing of the treaty with the Soviet Union does contain some meaning of alienating Germany, and blindly following the policies of other countries has recently been severely criticized by some Japanese. Fourth, from the perspective of the Far East situation, Japan is surrounded by enemies. Only the relations with the Soviet Union to the north are slightly eased. If it actually turns from friend to foe again, then if it cannot obtain a guarantee of peaceful coexistence in other areas, it will inevitably fall into the siege of opposing forces on all sides. The recent developments in the international community regarding the Far East situation have made Japan's compromise with democratic countries even more impossible than before. Fifth, Japan's foreign policy in the future has a great tendency to re-orient towards Britain and the United States. However, when Japan is threatening Britain and the United States with the Tripartite Alliance and the Neutrality Pact, and it cannot cause the revival of Britain and the United States' appeasement policy, then at this time when Britain and the United States are less afraid of the Nazis than before, there is no need to lightly give them excuses to Japan. Based on this analysis, it can be seen that even if Japan's intention to advance north has recovered its strength, it cannot turn around due to various realistic conditions. If the Axis itself is unable to win in the war against the Soviet Union, what it expects from Japan will inevitably fail. However, if it is actually moved by the Nazi seduction, presumptuously advances north to show off its power, then its encounter can be expected to inevitably repeat the mistakes of sending troops to eastern Siberia in 1919, but because today's situation is very different from 22 years ago, the process of its failure will inevitably be incomparable to that battle.

### The Chongqing Tunnel Suffocation Case: The Review Committee Completes Its Work; Chairman Chiang Cables His Subordinates, Encouraging Them to Enhance Their Spirit of Loyalty and Dedication; Hopes the Public and Youth Will Participate in Air Raid Defense; Liu Zhi Relieved of Concurrent Position as Chongqing Air Defense Commander

Chongqing - The review committee for the major tunnel suffocation tragedy in this city on June 5th has completed its work. The details of the review process are detailed in the review report. Since their establishment, the Air Raid Shelter Engineering Technology Improvement Committee and the Air Raid Shelter Management Improvement Committee have also convened meetings and discussed designs in detail, formulating future improvement plans separately (see reports of each committee for details). The plans have been submitted to the highest authority for approval and will be faithfully implemented by the responsible agencies. In order to handle this case, the Military Affairs Commission issued three orders, and Chairman Chiang also issued a circular telegram, repeatedly instructing air defense and rescue personnel, hoping to make up for past mistakes and promote future effects. The original text of the orders and circular telegram are attached below. (Orders of the Military Affairs Commission)

(1) Liu Zhi, concurrently commander of Chongqing Air Defense, should be relieved of his concurrent position. This order. (2) He Guoguang, deputy commander of the Chongqing Garrison, will concurrently serve as the commander of Chongqing Air Defense. This order. (3) Xie Yuanmo, deputy director of the Engineering Department of the Chongqing Air Defense Command, is to be dismissed for dereliction of duty in the major tunnel suffocation case that occurred in this city on June 5th. This order. (Circular telegram of Chairman Chiang)

Addressed to the Chongqing Air Raid Rescue Committee and forwarded to the Air Defense Command, the Chongqing Municipal Government, and relevant air raid rescue agencies and civil defense corps service teams: On the 5th of last month, a Japanese aircraft attacked a large tunnel in this city, causing a suffocation tragedy. Zhongzheng has been suffering ever since and has not forgotten it for a day. The review committee has now determined the actual situation at the time of the incident, and the Management Improvement Committee and the Technology Improvement Committee have drafted detailed plans for future air raid shelter management improvement and engineering equipment improvement measures, which have been reviewed and approved and are being actively implemented. Although the fellow countrymen who died this time cannot be brought back to life, we must take remedial measures to correct past mistakes. Recalling that all personnel serving in air raid defense, rescue, medical care, pensions, and fire protection in our capital for the past three years have mostly been loyal and dedicated, not afraid of hardship and danger, and actively increasing efforts to seize time. This spirit and facts are not only seen by the people of the city, but also make it impossible for the Japanese to succeed in their poisonous schemes. After this suffocation tragedy occurred, almost all the hard work of the past years was ruined in one fell swoop. The majority of the people were sacrificed in the tragedy, and those of our past service personnel who died in the line of duty cannot rest in peace. It can be seen that a single lack of consideration can make all efforts in vain, and one person's negligence can cause the entire group to be disgraced. Now that the post-disaster plan has been formulated, and the authority and responsibility of the agencies have been re-divided, from now on, I hope that all levels of service personnel will still maintain the essence of loyalty and dedication, remember the painful lessons of this time, redouble their vigilance, and work harder. Those government officials who are responsible should be more vigilant in adhering to their duties, especially cautiously, and must not be negligent in the slightest, resulting in mistakes. They should know that protecting the people is the responsibility of the government. If something is possible, but the effort is not exhausted, then even if the society does not blame them, they should feel guilty. At the same time, I hope that the public and youth will actively participate in air raid services, pool their wisdom and efforts, and work together to achieve success, hoping to make up for past mistakes and promote future effects. This is what I sincerely hope for. Zhongzheng, July 2nd, waiting for the secret report from Sichuan. (Electric dispatch on the 2nd)

### Madame Deng Baoshan Died in Bombing

Yulin - A few days ago, Japanese aircraft wreaked havoc in Lanzhou.

Chairman Chiang was deeply saddened upon learning of this and sent condolences yesterday. (Electric dispatch on the 1st)

### All German Businesses in Qingdao Shut Down

Qingdao - After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Siberian Railway line to Germany was immediately closed. Consequently, all the flourishing businesses of German merchants in Qingdao over the past two years have now ceased operations. Peanut oil, a major product of Shandong province, was traditionally shipped to Germany in large quantities for the manufacture of artificial oil. German merchants have a significant stockpile of this, which they will now sell on the local market. Similarly, raw materials used to manufacture pigments, such as linseed oil and walnut oil, as well as squid oil used in making candles and soap, and soybean oil, cottonseed oil, pig bristles, sheepskins, pigskins, etc., which were traditionally procured and shipped to Europe by German merchants, are also affected. German merchants engaged in import businesses are also pessimistic about the future. The cotton textile industry anticipates significant changes in the North China pigment market, as most pigments were imported by German merchants. Once current inventories are exhausted, it will be difficult to obtain new supplies. Some merchants predict that the blue cloth worn by farmers and laborers will be greatly affected, as 90% of the dye used for blue cloth comes via the Siberian Railway. A large German trading house recently established a branch in Qingdao but is now making arrangements to withdraw. Furthermore, two major German manufacturing plants recently sent representatives here to promote their businesses, but they have now canceled their original plans and left quietly. (2nd dispatch)

### German Nationals Unable to Return Home Stranded in Tokyo

Tokyo - Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, transportation via Siberia has been cut off, leaving many German nationals unable to return home. The Imperial Hotel in Tokyo currently houses 100 Germans, with another 50 stranded in the area. Four hundred German nationals evacuated from the Dutch East Indies are expected to arrive here soon, and 150 German nationals from the United States are also preparing to come here. Currently, the only transportation route between Japan and Germany is via South America, but German nationals taking this route to return home risk being captured by British naval forces in the Atlantic. Therefore, most German nationals intend to stay in Japan for an extended period. The German Embassy and various Japanese-German friendship organizations are assisting these individuals in finding employment. (1st, Havas World Telegram)

### A Brief History of Riga, Capital of Latvia

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd - Riga, the capital of Latvia, which was occupied by German troops yesterday morning, has a population of 350,000. It was occupied by Soviet troops last autumn. Historically, Riga was briefly under Russian rule after the Swedish-Polish-Finnish War in 1710. German troops occupied it on September 3, 1917, and it became the capital of the Republic of Latvia in November 1918. However, a few days later, when German troops withdrew from Riga, it was occupied by Bolshevik elements. On May 23, 1919, German troops entered Riga and liberated it. Therefore, July 1, 1941, marks the second time in 22 years that Riga has been "liberated" by German troops.

### Gale and Torrential Rain in Bombay, India; Transportation Halted

Reuters, Bombay, 2nd - Telephone and telegraph communications between Bombay and major cities in India have been mostly cut off, and trains departing from Bombay have also been halted. This is due to unusually heavy rain in Bombay and its surrounding areas during the current monsoon season. Torrential rain has lasted for 36 hours, accompanied by cyclones. Rainfall of 15 inches north of Bombay has caused widespread flooding in the suburbs, disrupting railway traffic.

### United States and Burma Implement Reciprocity; Stop Collecting Import Duties on Ships and Goods to Facilitate the Mass Shipment of Supplies to China

United Press, Hyde Park, 2nd - President Roosevelt has ordered that ships arriving at American ports from ports in Burma are to be exempt from ship taxes and unequal tariffs. Furthermore, Burmese products and products from various countries transported by Burmese ships are to be exempt from tonnage taxes. This order is retroactive to June 10 and aims to allow American supplies to be freely transported to China via the Burma Road. This is because the Burmese government must grant the same treatment to American ships and goods. The Burmese government has already ordered the abolition of import duties on American goods, so the U.S. President issued this order in response. The order does not explicitly mention the Sino-Japanese War, but its intention is clear. This order will remain in effect for the duration of the Burmese order.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd - According to Japanese newspapers yesterday, the greatest objective of the recent, active military cooperation between the U.S. and China seems to be the use of Chinese airfields. The U.S. has already dispatched a large number of airplanes to Chongqing, and many American pilots have arrived in Chongqing. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that this American assistance should not be overemphasized, but if the Japanese government does not take effective measures to counter this anti-Japanese demonstration, then the U.S. will increasingly use Chongqing as its Far Eastern frontline.

The Air Ministry stated that in Monday's raid, major German industrial centers such as Gelsenkirchen, Duisburg, and Cologne all caught fire.

Reuters, London, 2nd - Last night, British bombers, protected by a large formation of fighter planes, flew over the English Channel and continued their offensive patrols in the skies over northern France. The British air squadron passed over a town off the coast of Kent, with so many fighter planes that it was impossible to count them. Shortly thereafter, the sound of exploding bombs carried across the sea, shaking houses.

### U.S. President Reiterates Previous Statements; Willing to Maintain a Position of Peace, but Recognizes that Hope and Belief are Two Different Things; Refuses to Criticize Secretary of the Navy's Candid Remarks

United Press, Hyde Park, 2nd - President Roosevelt reiterated yesterday the declaration of September 1939, stating that the United States will maintain a position of peace. The difference is that this time, the President specifically expressed doubt about the U.S.'s ability to maintain peace for a long time during the intense development of overseas wars. The President refused to comment on Secretary of the Navy Knox's statement on Monday night that the United States must immediately use its naval power to eliminate German forces in the Atlantic.

Reuters, New York, 2nd - President Roosevelt received journalists yesterday and reiterated his hope that the United States could remain aloof from the war, but stated that hope and belief are indeed two different things. It is not difficult to see how the people of the country will vote on the question of whether the United States should actively join the war against the Axis powers, the President added, everyone is against war and against sin in the same way. The President stated over the past two months that he hoped that the U.S. could stay out of the war and had criticized the current authority's policies and guiding the country to actively participate in the war, so the President re-issued this statement yesterday regarding the arrest of spies, the President did not wish to make a statement.

Havas News Agency, Washington, 2nd - Secretary of the Navy Knox released a statement yesterday and advocated that the United States should destroy the German threat in the Atlantic at this time. The famous isolationist Senator Wheeler commented and said that Secretary of the Navy Knox's remarks are almost in conflict with the U.S. Constitution, if he does not resign automatically then the Senate and the House should take action on this matter.

International News Service, Hyde Park, 2nd - After Secretary of the Navy Knox's speech yesterday that the U.S. Navy should take action immediately, White House spokesman Senator Pepper said, "Knox's candid remarks are certainly jarring, but time and history will prove that he is correct."

United Press, Boston, 2nd - Civil Defense Director and Mayor of New York City, La Guardia, announced yesterday that the Department of the Army is now considering whether to issue gas masks to the 50 million people living in the Atlantic Gulf and Pacific coastal areas. These two places could be attacked by an enemy that would wage war against the Americas, he said, and the Department of the Army will also consider whether to establish American guard teams to protect locations such as factories and public utilities. At the 23rd Governors' meeting, they requested that a decision be made whether the guard teams of the states are sufficient, or whether federal assistance is needed.

Haitong News Agency, Washington, 2nd - Reliable sources here announced this morning that the U.S. government has proposed a Pan-American export trade control system to the 21 American republics. This was proposed by U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles in the International Financial and Economic Advisory Committee of the Americas, with representatives from various American countries participating in the meeting. The purpose of this plan is to safeguard the raw materials needed for U.S. armaments.

### United States Should Quickly Resolve the Problem of Military Supplies Reaching Britain

United Press, New York, 2nd - The problem of American armed assistance to Britain has become extremely urgent as a result of the massive losses of British ships and German planes bombing Hong Kong, various industrial and transportation centers, this problem seems to be resolved to some extent in the coming weeks, by pressure from American public opinion. Resolving this problem has two sides. The first side advocates immediate escort, and even firing if necessary, the reason being that Britain cannot save itself, if the United States fails to save it in time, I am afraid that the consequences would be unimaginable, the second side says that even if the United States provides assistance it will not be able to save Britain, between these two sides there is still a compromise, this faction's decision will be produced soon, the author believes that even if this side of the Atlantic has various views on the degree of loss of British shipping, but Britain is already in a bad situation, the author believes that, according to careful research, the vessels damaged by the British allies and neutral countries since the beginning of the war 21 months ago, are a total of 6 million tons, the number of 488,000 tons lost in April seems quite true, from these losses it can be seen that only Britain alone can never win against the submarine and aircraft attacks in the Atlantic, if goods transported by the United States to Britain, and those able to reach Britain, are at a minimum below the required limits, then there will be a major impact on the British fighting force, our country has now, as President Roosevelt advocated, become the arsenal of democracy, whether military supplies can absolutely reach Britain in huge quantities depends on the decision of the people and Congress, our enormous industrial production last year, in terms of aircraft, has increased greatly, and 1,427 aircraft were produced in April, and this amount is only the beginning of production, electricity production has increased by one thousand percent, the manufacture of rifles and machine guns has also increased greatly, and tanks are produced at a rate of one hundred per month, which is only the beginning of production, there are 561 warships under construction, the problem at hand is whether we can transport these items to Britain before it becomes hopeless, the author believes that this is a problem that the United States should resolve quickly at present.

### Soviet Union Contacts US About Purchasing War Materials, US Mulling Lift of Export Restrictions

Reuters, Washington, 2nd - Undersecretary of State Welles announced yesterday that the Soviet Union has initially contacted the United States regarding supply matters. Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Umansky, discussed with Welles the Soviet Union's ordering of goods in the US. Welles told people that this request has been forwarded to other relevant administrative departments, but Welles declined to specify what the Soviet Union needed, saying that the Soviet Union is a warring nation, so it is inconvenient to announce it.

United Press, Washington, 2nd - According to sources close to the Soviet Union yesterday, the Moscow government has expressed satisfaction with the U.S. government's attitude towards the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has also contacted the United States regarding the possible purchase of several key raw materials for the war effort. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has expressed gratitude to the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, for the statement made by U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles to Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Umansky, regarding the U.S.'s rapid aid to the Soviet Union. It is known that Molotov expressed satisfaction with President Roosevelt and other government officials' attitude towards the Soviet Union. Welles recently stated that the Soviet Union has contacted the United States regarding the purchase of key raw materials. Welles stated that Umansky has submitted this request to the appropriate parties, including the Production Bureau, and that the Lend-Lease Act and the price of raw materials were not mentioned. Welles also stated that he could not announce the types of raw materials that the Soviet Union currently needs, and that the United States is currently considering lifting all export restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union.

TASS, New York, 2nd - The American Association for Relations with the Soviet Union convened a mass meeting on the 2nd, demanding that the United States and the Soviet Union strengthen cooperation to defeat Hitler. Many prominent figures from Britain and the U.S. spoke at the meeting. Workers and progressive cultural figures in several American cities also convened meetings, unanimously expressing their support for the Soviet Union. A Slovakian newspaper published in Chicago denounced the Slovakian fascists, saying that they were indeed Hitler's lackeys, and that the Soviet Union was indeed a friend of Slovakia.

United Press, San Francisco, 2nd - Ardent isolationist Lindbergh violently attacked the U.S. for giving friendship and assistance to the Soviet Union last night. Lindbergh, with the support of the "America First" committee, gave a speech saying that he would rather see the U.S. mistakenly ally with Britain or even Germany than take any steps that would lead to a U.S.-Soviet alliance. He said, "Yesterday's murderers and looters are now considered heroic defenders of culture, and yesterday's heroic defenders of culture have now become villains of aggression, Finland and France are currently at odds with our friend the Soviet Union."

### Robin Moor Incident Compensation - US Demands One Million Gold Dollars

Reuters, New York, 2nd - "American Daily" Washington report said, the U.S. is now demanding a million U.S. dollars in compensation from Germany for the sinking of the American ship "Robin Moor" by a German submarine. Democratic Senator Walsh is now asking Secretary of the Navy Knox to answer Senator White's criticism that the United States now wants to sink submarines.

International News Service, Washington, 2nd - The State Department has learned that the U.S. government will demand over one million U.S. dollars in compensation from the German government for the sinking of the "Robin Moor", this amount is the approximate value of the ship when it was torpedoed, and compensation of 1,000 to 1,800 U.S. dollars for each American passenger, and an average of 300 U.S. dollars for each crew member, since no American lives were lost, the demand is only for compensation for private property, the ship itself and the goods on board, it is said that this compensation may be drawn from German government funds frozen in the U.S., but the U.S. has not revealed anything about this. It is reported that although the "Robin Moor" has been abandoned, the ship is quite important at a time when merchant ships are scarce. Experts acknowledge that the ship can fetch a good price in the shipping market.

Matsuoka made the above remarks after attending the Imperial Conference that finalized this policy, and it may indicate that Japan is currently closely monitoring the development of the British-Soviet war against Germany for more decisions. It is heard that Japan's policy will not be announced for the time being. Matsuoka's remarks continued, As the government announced today, the Imperial Conference has decided on an important policy, it goes without saying that the situation caused by the German-Soviet war cannot be dealt with by the simple concept of the outbreak of a war between the Soviet Union and Germany, therefore, we intend to monitor the development of the situation with the utmost caution and preparation, we have faith and a firm determination, at the same time, we must always pay attention to the development of the war, and the situation in the world, he feels that there is a truly serious emergency state in the world, which is developing before us, allowing it to be more serious with the East Asian situation that directly relates to our country, the more calm and united our people must be.

United Press, Tokyo, 2nd - Well-informed sources scoffed at the recent rumors that Shigemitsu Mamoru had a special mission and would succeed as Foreign Minister. Cabinet Information Bureau spokesman Ishii strongly denied rumors that the cabinet was about to be reorganized.

United Press, Tokyo, 2nd - The "Diplomatic Review" magazine, supported by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that Japan is willing to respect both the German-Italian-Japanese alliance and the Soviet-Japanese neutrality treaty, so as to concentrate its attention on the New Order in East Asia and prevent the European war from spreading to the Pacific.

### German Forces Launch Full-Scale Offensive; Soviet Troops Engage in Fierce Resistance, Vowing Not to Yield an Inch; Germany Claims Capture of Riga and Lusk

Reuters, London, 2nd – Reports indicate that the Soviet-German war across the entire front has intensified. Despite facing fierce resistance from Soviet troops, Nazi forces claim to have penetrated deeper into Soviet territory, capturing Riga, the capital and seaport of Latvia, and Lusk, south of the Pripet Marshes in Soviet-held territory. Moscow has not yet acknowledged the loss of these two cities but stated that Soviet forces have withdrawn from Lviv. A summary of the general situation on the entire front today is as follows:

In Finland and the far north, the German side claims that German-Finnish forces have crossed the narrowest part of Finnish territory near the White Sea, Kandalaksha, cutting off the rear of Soviet forces in Murmansk or the northern Kola Peninsula. The Soviet side claims that enemy forces in that area, after making some advances, have been contained by Soviet forces in the Murmansk region. In the Baltic region, the German side claims that a German vanguard led by Colonel Lusch advanced rapidly through Mildo (27 miles southwest of Riga) and reached the southwestern district of Riga on June 29th, and has now occupied the city. Both sides report Soviet counterattacks along the Dvina River between the coast and a certain city in the southeast, but Soviet forces within Lithuania and Latvia appear to be trapped in one corner. In the Minsk area, the German side claims that its vanguard has reached the Berezina River. The Soviet side reports that Soviet forces are putting up strong resistance in the Krubek district (85 miles southeast of Minsk) on the banks of the Berezina River. Both the Soviet and German sides have mentioned the fierce fighting of a Soviet unit isolated between Bialystok and Minsk in the southwest. In the Lviv area, the German side claims to have occupied Lviv, and the Soviet side also admits that Soviet forces have withdrawn from the city, adding that Soviet forces counterattacked about 40 miles east of Lviv, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. However, German forces may now have launched a pincer movement, advancing from Lviv in the north and Bukovina in the south, with elite troops leading the charge. On the Romanian border, both sides report fierce fighting on the Prut River. The Soviet side claims that enemy attacks have been repelled.

Reuters, London, 2nd – The German official news agency broadcast last night that German forces had occupied Lusk in Poland, and Riga, the capital of Latvia, had also fallen. The capture of Lusk was achieved by three tanks advancing ahead of the main German forces. These three tanks, after entering Lusk, were cut off due to the burning of a bridge, but still defeated two Soviet tanks and three heavy anti-tank guns, and subsequently repelled four Soviet tanks and one armored reconnaissance vehicle. By evening, German forces had completely occupied the city. (Note: Lusk is an industrial city on the Styr River, 85 miles northeast of Lviv, strategically located on the path of German forces advancing towards Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.) A recent German communiqué stated that Soviet communications had been damaged by German air raids, with four sections of the railway line from the Baltic Sea to Leningrad damaged. Yesterday, five troop trains and one ammunition train in the central region were destroyed by bombing. A foreign dispatch from Riga stated that Riga is now under German control. The city's radio station had been silent for several days but resumed broadcasting yesterday morning, with a German officer announcing the fall of Riga.

Reuters, London, 2nd – A German radio broadcast of a German High Command communiqué stated that German forces had occupied Riga, and German forces between Gachassin Mountain and Pripet Marshes were currently advancing, pursuing enemy forces on both sides of Lviv. Soviet forces besieged between Bialystok and Minsk fought fiercely for days, attempting to break through without success, suffering extremely heavy losses. Enemy troops repeatedly used heavy tanks to assist in the fighting, but all attempts to break through failed. German forces in the east have reached the Berezina River. German forces on the front line between Dunaburg and Riga have reached the Daugava River and have forcibly crossed the river in several places. Enemy counterattacks in this area have also been repelled. German air forces are assisting in the fighting by launching attacks everywhere, bombing retreating enemy forces in several directions east of Lviv. German aircraft have also attacked and heavily damaged Soviet forces besieged between Bialystok and Minsk and those retreating from Riga. At night, German air forces also bombed coastal ports in the east and south.

Soviet-German War Report

TASS, Moscow, 2nd – The Soviet Information Bureau released the following report on yesterday's combat situation: "Yesterday, our forces continued to fight fiercely in Murmansk, Kholm, Twersk, Minsk, and Lusk. In other areas, our forces maintained defensive lines, preventing enemy forces from crossing the border. In the Murmansk area, superior enemy forces have been prevented from advancing due to our resistance. In the Kholm area, the enemy launched simultaneous attacks at several points, but all were repelled by our counterattacks, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. In the Twersk area, our forces fought valiantly against enemy tanks and infantry, preventing them from crossing the Tsaperna River. In the Minsk area, our forces continued to fight against enemy mobile units. Our forces used defensive lines of anti-tank artillery fire (this line consisted of continuous rapid-firing cannons and machine guns) and counterattacks to prevent enemy tanks from advancing, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. In the Lusk area, we have crushed the offensive of a large enemy tank force. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses in that area. In the Lviv area, our forces have withdrawn according to the original plan."

According to reliable reports, 50 enemy aircraft were shot down on the 30th, and we also lost 17 aircraft. Our infantry and tank forces are defending the homeland and have done their duty to the fullest extent, overcoming countless difficulties. Every inch of land will not be easily given up. Although fascist soldiers have repeatedly launched attacks, they have all been repelled by our hand-to-hand combat. Yesterday, the enemy lost 50 tanks. A certain infantry unit destroyed 6 tanks, and a certain anti-tank artillery unit destroyed 80 enemy tanks.

Haitong News Agency, 2nd, German Führer's Headquarters – The German war report this afternoon stated that German forces are fighting against Soviet forces in Eastern Europe, making rapid progress. A major tank battle occurred in Slozsovo, south of Pripet, where 100 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In the area of Dubno, German forces engaged in a fierce battle with Soviet forces for two days, annihilating the Soviet forces, with 120 armored vehicles falling into enemy hands. The majority of Soviet forces surrounded east of Bialystok have been annihilated, with 100,000 prisoners, 400 tanks, and 300 cannons falling into German hands. Riga has been occupied by German forces, and Windau in western Latvia has also been seized. German forces and Finnish forces yesterday prepared to attack Soviet territory together with Finland. German aircraft provided cover for infantry attacks on enemy concentration points. Soviet forces retreating east of Lviv and towards Estonia encountered air raids and suffered heavy losses. The Soviet Air Force repeatedly suffered setbacks. Hungarian forces attacking from the Carpathian Mountains have joined forces with German forces.

The German Offensive Route into the Soviet Union is Obvious; the Soviets Should Emulate the Spirit of China

Reuters, London, 2nd – A Reuters military correspondent stated that if German forces capture Minsk, they will quickly attack Moscow and, at the same time or after reaching Moscow, move north to threaten Leningrad, launching a large encirclement operation against Soviet forces still fighting on the Baltic front. German forces in the south, advancing towards Kyiv from the northwest, will also move to directly target Odesa, launching another encirclement operation aimed at cutting off the rear of the entire Soviet force on the Bessarabia-Ukraine front. If the German side succeeds in this move, it will not only destroy a large part of the Soviet forces but also devastate a large part of Ukraine with minimal resistance. The German advance south into Ukraine from the north may not have been anticipated by the Soviet side. At that time, the German side will likely win over the Ukrainians and minimize damage to the harvest as much as possible. The German occupation of Lviv may be a sign of this strategy. The German side has employed this tactic in Poland and France, namely using overwhelming force to break through enemy lines in a frontal attack, followed by a large encirclement operation to cut off the rear of large enemy forces and force them to surrender. Of course, the Soviet side is currently facing danger, but it can quickly mobilize sufficient reserve forces to overcome it. Even if German forces achieve their current goal, namely occupying the line from Leningrad through Moscow to the Black Sea, they may not necessarily win. Everything from now on depends on the Soviet government's determination to lead the country and the full efforts of the Soviet people to continue the struggle. Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his people have set a great and noble example for the Soviets, and the Soviet side's resources, factories, and railways are far beyond what China can match.

German-Finnish Allied Forces Reach the White Sea Coast; 20,000 Soviet Troops Surrounded in Hanko

United Press, Helsinki, 2nd – Well-informed sources in Finland stated yesterday that German-Finnish allied forces operating in the Kola area have reached Kandalaksha on the White Sea, cutting the Soviet forces around Murmansk into two segments. Kandalaksha is also an important military transportation center because the Leningrad-Murmansk railway passes through it.

Havas, Stockholm, 2nd – "Stockholm Times" recently reported that 25,000 Soviet troops stationed on the Finnish island of Hanko have been surrounded by Finnish forces. Hanko Port is located in southwestern Finland and was ceded to the Soviet Union as a military base after the Finnish-Soviet War.

TASS, Moscow, 1st – There are two islands in the Gulf of Finland separated only by a strait. Our troops are stationed on one of them, while the other is occupied by enemy forces. On the morning of June 29th, enemy artillery began to roar, and the entire strait was obscured by smoke. The enemy began to advance, and ships could be glimpsed coming forward through the smoke. Enemy machine gunners were ready to fire, but the Red Army remained calm and did not move until the enemy reached a distance of 100 to 150 meters, at which point they opened fire with a barrage. The enemy ships tried to retreat, but it was too late. Although they tried to return fire with machine guns, most were destroyed. Only a few landed, but they were also defeated by our bayonet squads and completely annihilated.

Nazi Air Force Extremely Active; Bombing Soviet Rear Lines of Communication

Haitong News Agency, 2nd, Berlin – According to responsible sources, German aircraft have repeatedly bombed Smolensk, between Minsk and Moscow, hitting ammunition and aircraft factories. Airfields have also been bombed. German aircraft also bombed and destroyed the seaport of Murmansk. The railway between Odesa and Tarnopol in southern Soviet Union has also been cut off by bombing. The power plant in Girosske has also been hit.

Haitong News Agency, 2nd, Berlin – The aircraft used by the German Air Force to destroy enemy rear lines of communication include not only fighters but also destroyers and bombers. Several sections of the railway from Potokov to Leningrad were destroyed by bombing on Monday, depriving Soviet forces retreating from Latvia of transportation. Communication lines in the central war zone have also been bombed, with five freight trains and one ammunition train destroyed. Five cannons, nine tanks, and hundreds of freight cars were also destroyed.

Red Army Fights With Unwavering Resolve; Ingenious Defense Arrangements

Reuters, London, 2nd – A dispatch from Berlin reports that German reports indicate that Soviet soldiers in the current war consistently display a willingness to die that is unmatched by the enemy. Soviet soldiers possess an unwavering spirit and hold their ground, willing to perish with their fortifications. The Soviet army's arrangement of defensive trenches and underground communications is quite ingenious, as in the last great war. Soviet forces often adopt the ambush tactics they used in the previous civil war, encircling and annihilating enemy troops even after the first wave of attackers has broken through between the first and second lines of defense. Therefore, the fighting everywhere is extremely fierce. The Soviet Air Force is very brave when attacking, but its aiming technique is relatively poor.

### Auchinleck Succeeds Wavell as British Commander in the Middle East; Wavell Transferred to India; Lyttelton Joins the War Cabinet

Reuters, London, 2nd – An official announcement states that General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, has been exchanged with General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of India. It was also announced that Lyttelton has been appointed as a member of the War Cabinet and will represent the Cabinet in handling the planning necessary for operations in the Middle East. The news of Wavell's transfer to India as Commander-in-Chief has surprised all newspapers, but all believe that Wavell has been overworked in the past year and clearly needs to be reassigned to a less demanding position. It is reported that this is a wartime appointment, with the duration of the term depending on military circumstances. General Auchinleck was born in 1884 and is known for his prudence and agility. He led Allied forces in capturing Narvik in the Norwegian campaign and was appointed Commander-in-Chief of India earlier this year.

Reuters, London, 2nd – In the House of Commons today, questions were raised regarding Lyttelton's appointment as Minister of State and the exchange of General Wavell and General Auchinleck. Prime Minister Churchill replied that he did not intend to comment on this transfer and stated that this transfer had received very broad approval and was a beneficial and important step.

International News Service, London, 2nd – Due to the British government's implication that Britain may use India as a major route for assisting the Soviet Union, and also wants to strengthen India's defenses to prevent a German attack in the near future, the government announced today that General Wavell, the current Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East, has been transferred to the post of Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India. The current Indian General Auchinleck will succeed General Wavell as Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East. News of this has been greeted with excitement in London, but newspapers cannot immediately offer criticism on this change. However, the British Authority News Association pointed out that General Wavell's mission to India is to actively preside over matters relating to Soviet aid via India. General Wavell is very familiar with the Soviet Union and the tactics being implemented on that terrain, so the above opinion is all the more powerful. According to the "Daily Express", the British government's move is due to fears that the German threat will soon approach India after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The report also predicted that General Wavell's transfer to Commander-in-Chief of the Indian forces is another method by which the British government seeks to protect and consolidate its position in the Near East. The British government also announced that Colonel Lyttelton, the British Minister of Commerce, has been appointed as a member of the War Cabinet with the special status of Middle East Representative. Lyttelton has already taken a special express plane to Cairo last night to inspect the Middle East situation. At the same time, it was learned that General Auchinleck has arrived in Egypt to take over General Wavell's position.

Reuters, London, 2nd – According to Ankara Radio, Turkish President Ismet yesterday received Vichy cabinet member Mechin, who presented a letter expressing friendship from Marshal Pétain. The Turkish Foreign Minister and the French chargé d'affaires in Turkey were also present.

### British and Soviet Diplomatic Activities in Ankara; Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Returns to Post

Reuters, Ankara, 2nd – The Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Vinogradov, returned here yesterday by plane from Moscow.

Haitong News Agency, 2nd, Ankara – After the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey returned to his post from Moscow, the British and Soviet embassies have been exceptionally active in the past 48 hours, with frequent meetings between the ambassadors and military attachés of the two countries.

### Soviet Defense Committee Orders Protection of Farms; Prevents Enemy Sabotage of Crops; Female Students Eager to Serve the Country

Reuters, London, 2nd – According to Moscow Radio, the Soviet Defense Committee recently issued an order that fire-fighting guard teams should be organized in all farmlands and farms to patrol day and night to prevent enemy sabotage of crops. All granaries, agricultural machinery, and all equipment must be carefully protected against fire.

Reuters, London, 2nd – Moscow last night appealed to male and female doctors to serve the country as soon as possible, so that all parts of the front line have adequate medical facilities. Many female students have now voluntarily requested service. The radio also instructed soldiers throughout the country to beware of German forces wearing Red Army uniforms, in order to prevent the cunning enemy from carrying out their evil schemes.

### Sixth Academic Lecture to be Held on the 6th of This Month; Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang Still Invited to Speak

The open lecture series organized by the eight elders of this city has been held five times, with remarkable results. Since the first lecture in the series invited Jiang Zhuzhuang to speak on the problem of life, most of the audience admired him and felt that the first lecture was too short and did not satisfy their wishes. Therefore, they sent letters to the lecture series, requesting that they negotiate with Mr. Jiang to speak again, and some requested that the topic of self-cultivation in life still be used. It would be best if Mr. Jiang talked about his own outlook on life and self-cultivation, so that he could share his personal experience and the audience could benefit more. Mr. Jiang has served in education for more than 40 years and is always worried that he cannot teach all students. Therefore, taking advantage of the remaining summer vacation, he agreed to speak again on "My Outlook on Life and Self-Cultivation" at the sixth lecture of the series, which will be held at the Xuan Gong Theater at 10:00 a.m. on the 6th of this month. Jiang is the author of "Yinshi Zijing Meditation Method." This book has been in circulation for nearly 30 years and has more than 100,000 readers. It is estimated that more than 10,000 people have directly or indirectly benefited from following his daily self-cultivation rules. This time, Mr. Jiang will use his lifelong self-cultivation experience to share his personal experience, point out, and teach orally to the public in this hot summer, which is truly commendable.

### American Writer Wolfe Passes Through Shanghai: Discusses Factors in German-Soviet War - Hitler Striving to Destroy Soviet Union, but German Military Strength Declining - German and Soviet Military Forces Equal; Minsk Battle Important

American writer Henry C. Wolfe recently visited Shanghai. After staying for a week, he will travel south to Hong Kong and the Dutch East Indies to conduct special journalistic work. Wolfe traveled to Europe to conduct research after the First World War and has extensively studied the German-Soviet situation.

The Biggest Reason for Nazi Attack on Soviet Union

Yesterday morning (2nd), Wolfe met with reporters and stated that the biggest reason for the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union was to prevent the Soviet Union from becoming a military power in Hitler's rear. Obtaining raw materials from the Soviet Union was also an important issue. The German-Soviet war will have a significant impact on future developments. Hitler's main effort is to focus on destroying the Soviet Union so that he can conduct more effective warfare against Britain and even the United States in the Atlantic.

Two Continental Powers Cannot Coexist

At the same time, one factor that should not be ignored is that "the Soviet Union is fighting for itself, not for others." The European continent is not large enough to accommodate two major military imperialist powers such as Germany and the Soviet Union. Therefore, Hitler's main goal is to defeat the Soviet Union so that he has no worries about the future. According to Wolfe, Hitler understands that this is a protracted war that may continue for five to ten years. Therefore, it is necessary to destroy the Soviet Union before he can shift his full attention to the Atlantic.

Soviet Union Initially Hoped for a Slower Pace of War

Even if Hitler did not wage war on the Soviet Union, he could still obtain the necessary supplies from the Soviet Union. Stalin was willing to do everything in his power to supply Germany, hoping that the war would be delayed for another year, so that the Soviet side could become even stronger during this period.

Equal Strength in Terms of Soldiers

Germany is becoming increasingly weak due to its war against Britain. In terms of soldiers, Germany and the Soviet Union are equal, both being very good. In terms of equipment, the German side is better. However, German officers are far superior to Soviet officers. During Stalin's purges, Soviet military talent was damaged.

Smooth Highways Benefit German Army

The weakness of the Soviet army is the lack of the long and careful training necessary for officers to conduct warfare, and the staff work of the Soviet army is not yet comparable to that of the German army. The Soviet side has built a perfect military highway from Minsk to Moscow. Now that the German army has captured Minsk, its mechanized units can make good use of this highway.

Wolfe's Predictions Have Been Fulfilled

Wolfe's writings on Europe are widely circulated. In June 1939, Wolfe wrote an article predicting that the Soviet Union and Germany would compromise. Two months later, the Treaty of Non-Aggression was signed. In April of this year, Wolfe wrote another article predicting that war would break out between Germany and the Soviet Union, which has now come true.

### Pacific Hurricane to Hit Shanghai - Currently Moving Northwest

Due to its northwestward movement, the Pacific hurricane has a strong tendency to strike the southern coast of China. This hurricane did land west of Hong Kong the day before yesterday. However, after landing, the hurricane's force weakened and completely dissipated last night. However, another hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean. According to a Reuters reporter's inquiry at the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday morning, the newly formed hurricane is currently located at 13 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude, with its center within 120 nautical miles. The wind is moving northwest or northwest by west. Although it is currently far from Shanghai, if its direction remains unchanged, it will again strike the southern coast of China. As for the weather in this city, it has been extremely hot for days, with temperatures rising above 90 degrees. The entire city is like a boiling pot. As a result, true cholera has been discovered. Residents should not neglect prevention in order to avoid infection and protect their health.

### France and Soviet Union Sever Diplomatic Relations - No Repercussions in this City - No Friction Between French and Soviet Residents - Soviet General Association Still in French Concession

The Shanghai Times reports that yesterday (1st) rumors spread that as a result of the Vichy government's severance of diplomatic relations with Moscow, the French Concession authorities in this city would take action against Soviet organizations and periodicals within the Concession. These rumors have not been confirmed by French officials.

Soviet General Association Has Not Moved Out

A senior official at the French Consulate General stated that such matters are handled by the police department. A spokesman for the French police department stated that he was unaware of any possibility of taking such action. A semi-official Soviet source stated that they had heard rumors that the French authorities might instruct the Soviet General Association on Foch Road to move out of the French Concession, but had not yet received such an order. Responsible French officials stated that if any action were taken against Soviet residents, it would likely be directed at the Soviet General Association and various Soviet periodicals.

Newly Published Publications Prohibited from Sale

Regarding the latter, a recent incident can serve as evidence, namely that the pictorial magazine "Argus," which describes Allied military operations, was banned from being sold in the French Concession last week. The French police department issued this ban without providing a reason. Furthermore, a charity bazaar that British residents planned to hold in the French Concession to raise funds for the British War Fund was suddenly banned and had to be moved to the International Settlement. Well-informed French sources admitted that the severance of diplomatic relations between the French and Soviet governments might have repercussions in this city, but stated that, in their opinion, the authorities would not allow such repercussions to occur.

Guaranteeing Order and Peaceful Coexistence

As in September 1939, when France and Britain declared war on Germany, the French Concession authorities did not take action against German residents or German organizations within the Concession. In order to safeguard the peace and order of this international city, the French authorities are unlikely to take any action against Soviet residents, as France and the Soviet Union are currently coexisting peacefully and may continue to do so in the future. The problems of the Soviet General Association and the small number of Soviet publications in this city are extremely minor and do not require action that would provoke opposition from Soviet residents in the French Concession.

### Rice Ships Delayed in Arriving in Shanghai

Since the Pacific hurricane struck the South China Sea, many ships have been affected. The French cargo ship "Vạn Luân Nà," agented by the Wayfoong Company, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Vietnam on the 1st, but has now been postponed and is expected to arrive in port today or tomorrow, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf, carrying 47,000 bags of rice. The Norwegian cargo ship "Glan," has also been delayed by two days and is now scheduled to arrive in this port from Rangoon, Saigon, Hong Kong, and other ports on the 5th or 6th, carrying 27,150 bags of tribute rice, and will be docked at Pudong to unload.

### US Maritime Commission Accelerates Shipbuilding Program: 1.25 Million Tons to be Completed This Year - Two New Cargo Ships Have Arrived in China

According to sources in the American shipping industry in this city, the US Maritime Commission reports that American shipyards will be able to build 1.25 million tons of merchant ships this year. With the United States rapidly expanding its shipbuilding facilities, merchant ship production will increase to 3.6 million tons in 1942 and 5 million tons in 1943.

More Than 700 Merchant Ships to be Built

The commission has now set the price for the 705 merchant ships it has already built and is building at $162.5 million. The 1.25 million tons of cargo ships built this year are part of the 200 medium-sized cargo ships that President Roosevelt announced at the beginning of the year would be completed this year with an investment of $300 million. Once these cargo ships are completed, they will be dispatched by the Maritime Commission and distributed to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to transport military supplies and other necessities to China, Britain, and other countries to strengthen their ability to resist the Axis powers and their allies.

"Luckenbach" Cargo Ships Arrive in China

With the current high demand for merchant ships, the US Maritime Authorities, in addition to rushing to build new ships, are also requisitioning seven President liners from the American Mail Line, totaling 70,000 to 80,000 tons. However, in order to ensure Far East freight transport and prevent trade from being affected by the requisitioning of ships, the American Mail Line has requested the US Maritime Department to allocate several ships from Luckenbach Steamship Company, one of the top ten American liner companies, to operate in the Far East. Among them, the "Duroth Luckenbach" and the "Hary Luckenbach" have already arrived in China. These two ships each have a net weight of 6,533 tons, a deadweight of 13,000 tons, and a length of 473 feet, which is longer than the President liners. The ships are mainly used for cargo and only have four passenger rooms.

### Two Labor Disputes Resolved Yesterday: Rice Shop Labor and Management Reach Draft Agreement - Tea Industry Dispute Fully Resolved

The labor dispute in the rice shop industry in this city, which began on May 27, has lasted for more than a month. Due to the differing opinions of both parties, a satisfactory resolution has not been reached despite several rounds of negotiations. After another round of negotiations between the representatives of both parties, a draft settlement agreement was finally reached after repeated concessions. The full text consists of 18 articles, which the labor side has also expressed satisfaction with. It officially came into effect after being signed yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Thus, the labor dispute, which had lasted for more than a month, finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.

Measures to Improve Treatment in the Tea Industry

The strike by employees of more than 500 tea shops in this city, after repeated concessions from labor and management, had already partially resumed work the day before yesterday and was fully resolved yesterday. An agreement was also reached on salary increases and improved subsidies, etc., at the age of eighteen. The important points are recorded as follows: (1) Employee salaries are divided into nine grades: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, as the standard numbers: (A) Those within 10 yuan shall be increased to 30 yuan. (B) Those above 10 yuan but less than 15 yuan shall be increased to 40 yuan. (C) Those above 15 yuan but less than 20 yuan shall be increased to 50 yuan. (D) Those above 10 yuan but less than 25 yuan shall be increased to 60 yuan. (E) Those above 25 yuan but less than 30 yuan shall be increased to 70 yuan. (F) Those above 30 yuan but less than 35 yuan shall be increased to 80 yuan. (G) Those above 35 yuan but less than 40 yuan shall be increased to 90 yuan. Those above 40 yuan but less than 45 yuan shall be increased to 100 yuan. (I) All those above 50 yuan shall be increased by 100%. (2) Employee subsidies: Within the price limit of 110 yuan for rice by the Public Works Department, a monthly subsidy of 30 yuan shall be provided. If the limit is exceeded by 10 yuan, the subsidy shall be increased by 5 yuan, and so on (apprentices are not included in the ratio). (3) Monthly regulation of 6 yuan (4) Apprentice subsidies: 8 yuan per month in the first year, 12 yuan per month in the second year, and 16 yuan per month in the third year.

### New Free Policy for Children by Java Company

### From Hong Kong to the Mainland - Hong Kong Correspondence -

Since the Sino-Japanese War, Hong Kong has become a connecting point between the mainland and overseas due to the closure of various ports. Going from the mainland to overseas and from overseas to the mainland must pass through Hong Kong. That is, transferring from Shanghai to the Sichuan-Guangxi area via Hong Kong is also a more convenient route.

There used to be many routes from Hong Kong to the mainland, but now they have gradually decreased, leaving only two: taking a boat to Rangoon and then taking the Burma Road, and going to Guangzhou Bay and then transferring to Yulin and Liuzhou. Taking a boat to Rangoon and then taking the Burma Road is a more convenient route, but the cost is quite high. Going to Guangzhou Bay and then transferring to Yulin and Liuzhou is more difficult, but the cost is much lower.

The only ship that regularly sails from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay is the "Diamond" ship, but there are several ships sailing from Guangzhou Bay to Macau, so passengers who cannot wait for the "Diamond" ship can first go to Macau and then transfer to Guangzhou Bay from Macau. Because only the "Diamond" ship sails from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay, passenger capacity is very tight and fares are very expensive. Even buying steerage class costs at least ten Hong Kong dollars.

After arriving in Guangzhou Bay, due to the damage to the highway, there are 420 li of road from Guangzhou Bay to Yulin with no transportation available, so you can only walk or ride in a sedan chair. This section of road usually takes five days to walk. The first day is 110 li to Mijiang, the second day is 90 li to Shijiao, the third day is 60 li to Liangtian, the fourth day is 70 li to Luchuan, and the fifth day is 90 li to Yulin. If you ride in a sedan chair for the entire journey, the chair fare is about 150 yuan. If you hire a sedan chair in sections, it will cost about 30 yuan per day.

After arriving in Yulin, you can take a bus directly to Liuzhou, with a fare of about 90 yuan, which takes about two days, but there is not necessarily a bus every day. In addition to taking the bus directly, you can first take the bus from Yulin to Guixian, and then take a boat to Guiping, and then take a bus from Guiping to Liuzhou. This way is cheaper. Taking the bus from Yulin to Guixian costs 35 yuan, from Guixian to Guiping costs about 3 yuan, and then from Guiping to Liuzhou via Shilong costs a total of 15.7 yuan. The total cost is only about 50 yuan, which is much cheaper than the direct bus.

Of all the routes, only the section from Lianjiang to Shijiao is not very peaceful because it has to pass through Jilong Mountain. Security in other places is very good and there is no danger. Only the section from Lianjiang to Shijiao is now safer than before, as more and more people are traveling there, and some cautious travelers often hire a few military or police personnel as bodyguards when they depart.

### Fire on Zhifu Road Destroys Four Buildings - Two Killed, Three Injured

A sudden fire broke out on Zhifu Road, Zhejiang Road, yesterday morning, resulting in the destruction of four city buildings, two people were killed in the fire, and three residents were injured after jumping from the building to escape. The details are as follows:

Fire at Night Causes Great Loss

A fire broke out at the Ju Xing Restaurant at No. 163 Zhifu Road, Zhejiang Road, yesterday morning at about 3:00 a.m. Due to the dry and windy weather, the fire immediately broke through the roof. After learning about the fire, the Public Concession Fire Brigade quickly dispatched five pump trucks to put out the fire. The fire was put out at about 5:00 a.m. As a result, in addition to the Ju Xing Restaurant at No. 163, whose building and belongings were completely destroyed, the fire also affected the Long Xing Vegetarian Restaurant at No. 159, the buildings at No. 157 and No. 161, and part of a building in Changji Lane, causing great losses.

Three Injured after Falling; Two Bodies Dug Out

When the fire broke out, it was late at night. The residents on the upper floors of No. 163 were awakened from their dreams and jumped from the building to escape. Yao Rong (21 years old), Qin Naian (24 years old), and a man (23 years old) were all injured in the legs. They were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the fire yesterday morning, firefighters were cleaning up the scene when they dug out two male bodies in the rubble. It was discovered that the two bodies were residents living in the back building of No. 163. The bodies were sent to the coroner's office for examination. The cause of the fire is currently being investigated by the police.

### Building Near Yiyuan - Royal Cinema - Capacity of More Than 1,000 Spectators - To be Completed and Open This Year

The Times reports that a foreign businessman in this city will open a second-run cinema near Yiyuan at No. 1186 Lafayette Road and Albert Road at the end of November or the beginning of December. The construction cost is 1 million yuan, and it can accommodate more than 1,000 spectators, roughly equivalent to the Cathay Cinema. It is named "Royal Cinema." The French Concession authorities have already issued a license, and construction will begin soon. Since the opening of the Medical Painting Exhibition at the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association, visitors have been coming in an endless stream.

### Canvas Factory Owner Xiang Meiying Nearly Kidnapped While Visiting a Friend; Xiang Struggles with the Bandits, Passersby Call the Police; Officers Arrive and Shoot Down One Bandit

Yesterday's report mentioned a case on Daxin Street and Fourth Malu where bandits opened fire and resisted arrest, resulting in one being injured and captured. The truth of this case is that it was a failed kidnapping attempt. Xiang Meiying, the small owner of the Hechang Canvas Factory at No. 23 Ningbo Road, a native of Ningbo, is from a well-to-do family and owns two private cars.

Encounter in the Alley

Yesterday at 12:00 noon, Xiang drove his car, number 2049, to the home of a friend in Yingchunfang, Hubei Road, for lunch. When the car arrived at the entrance of Yingchunfang, Xiang was about to get out when suddenly a bandit, holding a gun, stepped forward. Xiang initially suspected it was a thief and told him that he had no money on him. The bandit then cocked the gun. Seeing that things were not good, Xiang immediately grabbed the wrist of the bandit holding the gun, and they struggled with each other. The bandit fired a shot, fortunately not hitting Xiang. At that time, passersby shouted "Robber!" The bandit, knowing that things were not going well, pushed Xiang to the ground and fled south.

Opening Fire to Resist Arrest

When the officer stationed at the Hubei Road and Fuzhou Road intersection, number 2104, heard the alarm, he rushed to the scene and fired six shots at the bandit. One bullet hit the bandit in the back, and he fell to the ground and was captured. A pistol and four bullets were confiscated. He was taken to the hospital by car. Subsequently, Li Pengfei, a Chinese detective from the Lao Zha Station, found that the bandit was named Yu Huacheng, a native of Shandong, 33 years old, and his injuries were serious. Yesterday morning, the station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, applied to the First Special Court for temporary detention of the suspect, pending his recovery and prosecution. Judge Fu Lin reviewed the report and approved the detention pending a rescheduled hearing.

### Criminal Cases of the Second Branch of the High Court Returned to the Original Site for Trial

Since the August 13th Incident, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court has been located at Lane 155, West Chongqing Road, Weihaiwei Road, to continue its work. All civil and criminal appeals have also been heard at the new location. Now, due to the extreme heat, all criminal appeals are being heard in the morning, resulting in insufficient courtrooms. Therefore, from July 1st, criminal appeals will be moved back to the original site at Qipu Road, North Zhejiang Road, while civil appeals will still be heard on Weihaiwei Road.

### Chauffeur Steals Oil Carelessly, Burns Car; Liu Liansheng Arrested Pending Trial

Liu Liansheng, a local, works as a chauffeur for a Belgian named Lan Fangdeng, manager of the Banque Belge pour l'Etranger on the Bund, driving car number 7854. Recently, Liu's living expenses have increased, and his income is insufficient. Therefore, he stole two gallons of gasoline from the car, worth nine dollars and twenty cents, and hid it under the driver's seat cushion. Unexpectedly, due to a gasoline leak, at 11:30 AM on the morning before yesterday, the car was parked on the Bund, and just as he was about to start the engine, it suddenly caught fire. In an instant, the fire spread and could not be contained. After reporting to the Fire Department, firetrucks were dispatched to the scene and extinguished the fire, but the car was completely burned, with losses amounting to over ten thousand yuan. Subsequently, Huang Hairu, a Chinese detective from the General Patrol Station, took the chauffeur Liu Liansheng into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The station's lawyer, Peng Qixin, presented the case and requested a rescheduling.

Zhang Yunsheng, a Chinese detective from the Huishi Patrol Station, discovered on the 20th of last month that the Dafeng Rice Shop at No. 964 Tangshan Road was using a standard five-sheng measuring device with the opening shortened by about half an inch. Rice measured in this way was sixty taels short per dan, which constituted a violation of the law. Therefore, the patrol station requested the First Special Court to issue a warrant to bring the shop owner, Zhu Shaoqiu (30 years old), a native of Chongming, to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The station's lawyer, Fang Fushu, prosecuted him for fraud, requesting severe punishment according to the law. When questioned, Zhu claimed that he had acquired the measuring device from someone else and was unaware of the shortening. He asked for leniency. Judge Dai Rongduo reviewed the evidence and announced the verdict in court, sentencing Zhu Shaoqiu to three months in prison and a fine of three hundred yuan. If the fine was commuted to labor, it would be calculated at two yuan per day. The measuring device was confiscated.

### Over 200,000 Silver Coins Shipped to Japan; Confirmed

After the silver problem in the Tianjin Concession was resolved through an agreement between Britain, Japan, and France, 3 million Chinese silver dollars, equivalent to 3 million national currency dollars, were shipped from Tianjin this spring to British India for sale. The proceeds were to be used for disaster relief in North China. Recently, it has been confirmed by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency at the Office of the Inspector General of Customs that silver coins worth 224,000 national currency dollars were loaded onto a ship at the Jiaozhou Customs and exported to Japan in mid-May of this year.

### Run Kangyong Yarn Company Fraud Case; Qi Zhaoji Detained; Accepts 140,000 Yuan Transaction in the Morning, Suddenly Closes in the Afternoon, Owner Flees

Run Kangyong Cotton Yarn Company, located in Room 354, Securities Building, Jiujiang Road, was founded by Qi Zhaokang and Qi Zhaoji. On the 27th of last month, cotton yarn merchants Zhao Bingyan, Qi Yongkang, and others purchased 90 bales of cotton yarn from Run Kangyong, totaling 140,132.50 yuan. They paid the full amount at the time, but when they went to collect the warehouse receipt in the afternoon, the company suddenly closed, and the person in charge had disappeared. Only an apprentice, Song Yongfu, remained inside. He was arrested and sent to the First Special Court, where the hearing was postponed. Xu Wenbin, the detective from the Lao Zha Patrol Station handling the case, arrested Qi Zhaoji at No. 22, Lane 19, Huasheng Road, and took him into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The station's lawyer, Fang Fushu, presented the case and requested a rescheduling. Judge Dai briefly questioned Qi and ordered him to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.

### Japanese Troops Land in Kanmen; Yongjia Unaffected; Jiang Fang Strengthened in the Oujiang Area; It is Not Easy to Go Upstream

Yesterday, this city received a telegram from Eastern Zhejiang stating that Japanese warships anchored off the coast of Yuhuan had lowered several small boats on the morning of the 1st, carrying several hundred Japanese soldiers, and landed in Kanmen, which belongs to Yuhuan County. According to inquiries made by reporters to Wenzhou natives in Shanghai, Yongjia has not sent a telegram reporting anything. According to those familiar with the situation, since Yongjia was recovered, the Japanese troops along the Oujiang area have completely withdrawn. However, Huang Da'ao Town, which belongs to Yuhuan County outside the port, is still occupied by the Japanese. This place is very close to Kanmen. It is possible that this landing at Kanmen is a branch from Huang Da'ao. However, Kanmen is outside the mouth of the Oujiang River. If the Japanese troops want to attack Wenzhou from there, it is definitely impossible because it is not easy to go upstream. Moreover, since Yongjia was recovered, the Oujiang River has been completely blockaded, and the river defenses have also been strengthened. Therefore, if a landing has indeed occurred at Kanmen, Yongjia will not be affected.

### Sponsoring Hidden Poverty; More Than 1,000 People Have Applied for Relief for Hidden Poverty

Since the Three Teachings Moral Benevolence Society of this city concluded its congee distribution work at the end of March, it has been providing rice meals since April 1st. By the end of June, it had distributed a total of 100,000 bowls of white rice over three months and is actively continuing the distribution. However, due to limited relief funds, it appeals to all sectors to donate as much as possible to facilitate long-term operations.

Applications for Hidden Poverty Exceed 1,000

In addition, since the society announced its plan to provide relief for hidden poverty, more than 1,000 people in the city who have been educated, are unemployed, or whose income is insufficient have applied for relief. After the society sent personnel to investigate and verify the claims, it has provided assistance to more than 200 people. The rest are still under investigation. The society is also aware that the applicants' children are either unable to continue their education or unable to enroll. Therefore, if requests are made, it can introduce them to jobs and schools. To prevent deception, warnings will be issued to those who are found to be cheating.

Appealing to All Sectors to Sponsor Separately

The society believes that there are many hidden poor people in the city, and their lives are so difficult that good families are breaking apart and falling into degradation. Therefore, in addition to providing relief itself, it specifically appeals to all sectors to sponsor them separately. The procedures are as follows: anyone who wishes to sponsor one or more families, or a particular person, can arrange for the sponsor to meet and talk with the sponsored person or select and designate a target themselves. The sponsorship period can be determined by the sponsor, but the assistance funds will be transferred by the society. At the same time, to give the children of the hidden poor opportunities to learn a trade and further their education, all parties are also asked to notify the society of any opportunities for jobs or the skills needed so that the society can select suitable applicants to introduce for trials. Those who wish to donate funds for education can also designate how they are to be used.

### Medical Association Ends Disease Prevention Campaign

The Municipal Medical Association's disease prevention campaign, which began on June 1, has been underway for a month. More than 50,000 citizens have been vaccinated at the association's various injection sites, protecting citizens' health, and its contribution is indeed not small. It is now reported that the association has ended the campaign as scheduled at the end of June, according to the original date, and has notified all member injection sites to stop injections from July 1. However, citizens who have already had their first injection before June 30 but have not yet completed the three injections may still be accommodated, but they must present the disease prevention campaign record certificate issued at the time of the first injection to the original injection site and request to continue the injections and will still be given a disease prevention certificate. It is reported that during the association's disease prevention campaign, the vaccines used at the various injection sites were provided free of charge by the five major pharmaceutical factories: New Asia, Xinyi, Dahan, Sino-French, and Jiuxing. In addition, Xin Ya, Xin Yi, Zhongying, Wuzhou, Sino-French, Huamei, Jicheng, Yuzhou, Jiufu, Zhengde, Jixing and other pharmaceutical factories and pharmacies have donated advertisements, and therefore the association expresses its very sincere gratitude for the pharmaceutical industry's sincere assistance in this matter.

### Grain; Rice Market Closed for One Day; Slightly Increased When Reopened

The rice market was closed yesterday on the first for the bi-annual settlement period for silver and money businesses, as is customary. Business resumed as usual yesterday. The trend has not yet broken out of a sideways state. When the market opened in the morning, due to the influx of existing stocks, buying was weak. The rice allocated by public warehouses for public sale is about to arrive in Shanghai one after another. Public sale tribute rice and June orders are also arriving in succession. Many floating stocks and scattered hoards are being released as the market changes. Therefore, prices for both spot and future rice have declined. Subsequently, domestic customers took advantage of the low prices to absorb stocks. Local businesses have been closed for several days and demand is still strong, while customers from inland areas such as Ningbo are particularly active. The market gradually rose, and the prices of various types of rice increased from low levels. As a result, some prices rose by several jiao to one jiao compared to the closing price the day before yesterday, while others remained unchanged. Yinghua Siji No. 2 Siamese rice was particularly strong, opening at 141 yuan to 141.3 yuan; small broken rice from 146 yuan to 148 yuan; broken tribute rice from 112.5 yuan to 114 yuan. 1,200 tons were traded. Spot rice: No. 1 Saigon rice 127.5 yuan to 125 yuan, No. 2 rice 121 yuan to 119 yuan, broken rice 96 yuan to 94 yuan, special Siamese No. 1 rice 131 yuan to 128 yuan, No. 2 rice 121 yuan to 119 yuan, rice tea 111 yuan, crushed rice 115 yuan, small broken rice 122.5 yuan to 120 yuan, Min Dang rice 130 yuan to 126.5 yuan, Tokyo crushed sharp rice 115 yuan, crushed sharp rice 95.5 yuan to 94.5 yuan.

Thick and thin japonica rice, due to the upcoming Little Heat season, inland inventories are dwindling, and few shipments are arriving. Merchants are more firm in their intentions, so local stores still feel unsatisfied. Most transactions are small, and the market has not seen any prosperity. Fresh early rice from the South Port is still priced at 137 yuan, big city rice at 136 yuan, and Zhongguan rice at 134.5 yuan. Wuxi original bagged aged japonica rice is priced from 131 yuan for high-quality rice to 126-127 yuan for secondary rice.

Glutinous rice, also due to seasonal factors, whether domestic or foreign, continues to be in a state of scarcity and sluggish sales. As a result, the market color is often mediocre and rarely changes. According to statistics, yesterday's total glutinous rice transactions in the city were no more than two or three hundred dan, and the prices quoted were the same as before the holiday. Hong Kong white yuan is still priced from 120 yuan for high-quality rice to 116-117 yuan; glutinous green beans from 111 yuan for high-quality beans to 105-106 yuan; domestic yuan ordinary 121 yuan and 120 yuan; Zhongguan rice 118 yuan; high-quality rice is out of stock and the market is empty.

### Flour Market Becomes Firm Again

Yesterday, the spot Western flour market became firm again. This is because the sale of Hua Factory's cheap flour has now stopped, and according to foreign firms, overseas sources are occasionally blocked. Therefore, Western rice in public warehouses must also be postponed to Shanghai, and with rice and oil prices rising, people's hearts are better. Speculators and hoarders have been absorbing stocks. Jinlong flour rose by five jiao upon opening, doing business at 32.5 yuan to 32.8 yuan. However, it calmed down slightly near noon, closing at 32.6 yuan. Other brands all called out higher prices. There was also Caishen flour at 32 yuan and Paotai flour at 33.23 yuan, purchased by local retailers for 500 bags. A total of more than 3,000 bags of Jinlong flour were traded, with actual sales accounting for half of them. The market situation is still considered stable. There is still no market for wheat.

### Oil Cakes; Edible Oil Sales Active; Prices Rise Suddenly by One Yuan; Soybean Cake Spot Sales Also Rise

Edible oil; yesterday, local retail sales were quite active. Major merchants were eager to sell, so the market suddenly turned lively, and prices rose by about one yuan compared to before. It is estimated that 80 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 200 cans of Yantai raw oil, 500 cans and 15 barrels of Jiangbei raw oil, 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 20 barrels of Hankou soybean oil, 70 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil, 40 barrels of Pudong soybean oil, and 400 dan of Qing oil from Dayou Factory were sold (prices detailed in the market price column).

Soybean cake; spot sales are gradually improving. Yesterday, inland gangs continued to load and transport in bulk, so people's hearts were encouraged, and prices rose by another two or three jiao. It is estimated that 3,000 pieces of Lu Zi soybean cake were sold, priced at 16.25 yuan to 16.3 yuan; 3,000 pieces of Dayou Factory soybean cake, priced at 16 yuan to 16.3 yuan; nearly 10,000 pieces of Shen Ji soybean cake, priced at 16.7 yuan to 16.9 yuan. Also, more than 20,000 pieces of July delivery futures were sold, priced at 17.55 yuan to 17.75 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton; American and Indian Cotton Prices Flat and Weak

The New York cotton market initially rose due to buying by traders, but subsequently fell slightly due to profit-taking by some, resulting in a closing price that was eight or nine pounds higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to selling by cotton merchants and profit-taking by bulls, but then rose slightly due to buying support. Yesterday's closing price fell by one or two rupees.

### Dried Goods; Cangzhou Red Dates Rise by Ten Yuan

Cangzhou red dates have recently been in short supply. The Chaohang has a batch of high-quality goods, a total of 89 bags, that are dry and good in color, and can be described as top-grade. They were all released yesterday, priced at 64 yuan, more than ten yuan higher than before. The market situation is very good.

### Sugar Market; Sugar Prices Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained tight, and continued to rise by about one yuan to several jiao. The Association's closing prices: spot 24 crude white June new goods 92.2 yuan to 92.4 yuan, up seven jiao; May imports 91.1 yuan, up one jiao; April imports 90.05 yuan, up six jiao; March imports 89.8 yuan, up four jiao; Dutch red KD and 　mark initially 73 yuan, then rose to 73.2 yuan, 73.5 yuan, up half a yuan.

### Economic Anecdotes

— Feng Liu

Economics (4)

Japan translates "Economics" as 経済学 (Keizaigaku). Yan Fu (Jidao) already discussed its inappropriateness in the translated preface of Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations". Yan's intention was to name the Japanese translation of Economics as 計学 (Jixue) or the Science of Accounting. He said:

"計学 (Jixue), Western name Economics, originally from Greek. Eco means household, Nomics is the transliteration of Nemo (Note: Nemo is Latin, meaning management). Its meaning originated in household management. Expanding on this, it encompasses all matters of estimating, managing, economizing, and accounting for expenses and revenue. Extending it further, it includes the principles for a nation or the world regarding production and consumption. Thus, the scope of its meaning is extremely broad. Therefore, the Japanese translated it as 経済 (Keizai), and the Chinese translated it as 理財 (Licai). But if one must seek complete inclusiveness, 経済 (Keizai) is too broad, while 理財 (Licai) is too narrow. So I have taken it upon myself to use 計学 (Jixue) to represent it. Although the meaning of 計 (Ji) is more than just the purview of the officials in charge of land or the writings of 平準 (Pingzhun), when examining past texts, words like 会計 (Kuaiji), 計相 (Jixiang), and 計偕 (Jixie) (Note: all found in the Records of the Grand Historian), along with the common expressions 国計 (Guoji, National Account) and 家計 (Jiaji, Household Account), seem to correspond more closely to the Greek Nemo. Therefore, The Wealth of Nations is a book on 計学 (Jixue)."

I deeply agree with Yan's statement that " 経済 (Keizai) is too broad, while 理財 (Licai) is too narrow." Although the word 計学 (Jixue) can be said to correspond to the current so-called Economics from the perspective of Western etymology, I do not dare to fully agree.

Since the widespread use of the two characters 経済 (Keizai), they have now become a common buzzword. Regardless of whether it's vegetables, rice, paper, pens, or even various other things, and regardless of whether they are related or unrelated, scholars and non-scholars alike frequently use the term 経済 (Keizai). Generally, in common parlance, the meaning of 経済 (Keizai) is nothing more than spending less and achieving greater results, or having the meaning of rational use. This actually vaguely coincides with the old term 経紀 (Jingji). The characters 経紀 (Jingji) originally meant managing and organizing. Later, it was used in the context of business operations, calling merchants 行紀 (Hangji), and because there was the name 行紀 (Hangji), business people were called 経紀 (Jingji) households. Moreover, because the establishment and prosperity of business people mostly came from diligence and frugality, it also referred to those who were diligent, frugal, and good at managing their wealth as 経紀 (Jingji). Over time, its usage evolved, and it no longer has the same meaning as the current term 経済 (Keizai). When exchanges emerged, those who mediated buying and selling were called 経紀人 (Jingjiren), which is similar to the old 行紀 (Hangji) in that their business was to mediate and collect commissions.

From this perspective, the current common usage of 経済 (Keizai) is probably what was formerly called 経紀 (Jingji); the meaning of Chinese 経済 (Jingji) is not comparable to the current Economics. However, since we are already accustomed to it, let us follow the convenience of its use and also 経済 (Keizai) it. (End)

### Piece Goods Loaded for North and South Seas

Yesterday, 200 pieces of cloth were shipped to Yantai, 115 pieces to Hong Kong, 30 pieces to Singapore, and 14 pieces to Penang.

### Hardware; American Bar Iron Spot Goods Extremely Scarce

Due to the active search by local canneries, toy factories, printing plants, cigarette factories, etc., the 200-pound American bar iron circulating in the market is temporarily in short supply. In addition, there has long been no source for this product overseas, and the Shanghai inventory is also thin. As a result, spot goods are increasingly scarce, and traders holding a small number of spot goods are very bullish, causing standard selling prices to soar. Recently, a standard assortment of 200 pounds per case is priced at 420 yuan, and large sizes are temporarily unavailable for purchase anywhere.

### The Love Affair of Cousin Siblings

— Jiang Hong

A few days ago, newspapers all published a short piece of social news, saying that a pair of cousin siblings fell in love and, unable to bear being apart, committed suicide by poisoning, resulting in their deaths.

The reality is probably not that simple. However, this type of tragedy is already commonplace in China and not surprising.

Most people have a common idea that close relatives like cousin siblings should not marry because close marriages can produce offspring with intellectual disabilities or mental defects. Undoubtedly, the couple's suicide pact has a considerable connection to this kind of thinking.

However, according to recent research by geneticists, this concept is not entirely correct. According to a survey by Professor Easter of Harvard University in the United States, cousin siblings with healthy ancestors who marry do not have a greater risk of producing mentally unhealthy children than ordinary marriages. Even if they have unhealthy children, it is not caused by the cousin siblings' marriage, but because the previous generation had unhealthy genes that were exposed in the marriage of cousin siblings. Consanguineous marriages can preserve ancestral weaknesses within the family, and at the same time, they can also preserve strengths. In ancient times, the pharaohs of Egypt, the Incas, the South American Donamis, and the European royal families all practiced consanguineous marriages, but the results produced some great geniuses. The family of German musician Bach produced twenty-eight outstanding musicians in five generations, mostly as a result of cousin siblings marrying; they kept the musical talent within the family. Therefore, cousin siblings with good heredity can marry, according to genetics. As for cousin siblings with poor heredity, their marriage does increase the possibility of mental defects in their children.

We do not advocate cousin siblings marrying or consanguineous marriages, but only point out a new scientific fact, proving that marriage between genetically healthy cousin siblings is harmless and does not need to be opposed or prevented.

As for committing suicide by poison for the sake of love or marriage, it is a kind of naive act of young people, which belongs to ideological and educational problems.

### The Time of Yellow Plum Rains: Bacteria Fly

— Ping

"Every house is bathed in the rains of the yellow plum season, the weather of ripe plums is half sunny and half cloudy." During this period, everyone in Jiangnan has felt annoyed, and what is even more hateful is that on everything, whether it is hats, shoes, or biscuit tins, even books on the bookshelf, you will find patches of velvet-like stuff, commonly known as mold. In fact, it is not mold, but a kind of lower plant, scientifically called mold; taking advantage of the humid environment of the yellow plum season, it launches a large-scale migration to all kinds of materials you own.

For this beautiful fungus - mold - we can only blame our own eyes for not being able to see its true face. However, the scientists in the laboratory have long observed it carefully under the microscope. It is said that this kind of mold is a microorganism composed of more than a dozen cells. They have willow-like bodies, branches, and separate branches, and they are also covered with velvet-like things, which become mold.

Fungi belong to the fungus phylum in the plant kingdom. They reproduce by spores. These spores are not the result of sexual reproduction, but a part directly split from the parent body. In the park, you may have the opportunity to pick a fern, open the back of its leaves, and you can see balls of millet-like things wrapped in the leaf pouches. With a gentle flick of your hand, they will fly away without a trace. The spores of mold are also like this; they leave the parent body and float in the air. As a result, they choose your hat and shoes to be their colonies.

In the colony, the spores take advantage of the yellow plum season. There is plenty of water, which can fully supply them with nutrients. There is little sunlight, which will not damage their bodies. So the spores gradually grow and split into new bodies at a certain period. Such reproduction continues, forming velvet-like patches.

To prevent the reproduction and parasitism of fungi, the first is to keep the air dry, because the scarcity of water can make it impossible for them to maintain life; the second is to have sufficient sunlight. Probably at about 70 degrees Celsius, they will not be able to survive. In short: As long as you get more sunlight, the fungi will naturally be eliminated.

(10) A Father's Heart

This is really an opportunity! Although for five or six years, he has come here every day to pick up his daughter, he always calculates the time very accurately, and sees Mei Bao dismissed from class as soon as he arrives. Even if he comes earlier, he has never encountered rain, and he has never come as early as today. Therefore, he has never seen Mei Bao attending class.

He straightened the blue cloth gown he was wearing, put down his trouser legs, and, with a heart beating violently, slowly walked forward.

Outside the corridor is the playground, and on the inside are a row of long windows. Inside the windows is the classroom.

The classroom was as quiet as if there was no one inside, except for a teacher in his thirties who was standing on the podium and talking. Begonia boldly approached the glass and quietly looked inside.

There were about thirty students inside. Half of them on the east side were bowing their heads and writing at their desks. Half of them on the west side were raising their heads and listening attentively to the teacher.

"... Although English grammar is far less difficult than French and German, if you don't remember it carefully, you will never be able to write English well..." The teacher lowered his head and thought for a while. "Now, let me test you. Zhou Qiyuan, give me an Auxiliary Verb!"

A boy of seventeen or eighteen stood up from the last row of benches.

"Can."

"Say another Transitive Verd."

"Come."

"Wrong! Think again." (148)

### Electric Buzzer Instead of Horn

— Li Yi

New things in the American army are really emerging endlessly. In addition to using loudspeakers to amplify the sound of bugles blowing reveille, recently, the headquarters of the 174th Cavalry Regiment has used electric buzzers to wake up soldiers who are still in a sweet dream. This kind of "horn" is slightly the same as the one used on cars, saving time and effort, and the effect is great. In this way, in the future, the horn used for reveille in the army may be eliminated.

### New Escort Warships

— Shen Xiong

British naval authorities, based on secret intelligence, know that Germany has six hundred new submarines participating in the Battle of the Atlantic. But Britain is confident, because she is rushing to build a large number of strong small warships, specially used for escorting convoys and dealing with submarines. These small warships have been carefully designed to withstand the storms and waves of the Atlantic.

Small warships are simple and strong, easy and quick to build, and cost only one-tenth of a destroyer. The installation of the ship has no waste at all, even a small part must have its use. Fifty or sixty sailors per ship is enough. The length of the ship is half of a destroyer, the displacement is four hundred tons, and the speed is 20 to 25 nautical miles per hour.

Although small warships have fewer emplacements, lower speeds, and thinner armor, they are also much cheaper to build. The cost of a destroyer can build almost twelve small warships. The issue of quantity is very important in escorting and dealing with submarines.

Small warships are equipped with two 4-inch cannons, four anti-aircraft machine gun emplacements, and two mine launchers. Due to the small size of the ship, the target for submarines is also smaller, so the possibility of being hit is also smaller.

There are now eighty small warships under construction in Canada, and it is said that the British headquarters will rush to build three hundred more at an alarming rate.

### Frozen Sleep to Replace Anesthetics

— Jie Quan

The New York World's Fair once demonstrated the strange event of "frozen sleep": a girl wearing thin underwear lay in a box full of ice cubes, gradually losing consciousness, as if she had frozen to death. After a while, people removed the ice cubes, and the girl slowly woke up.

Dr. G.H. Parker, a professor of animal behavior at Harvard University in the United States, recently published an article in a scientific journal, advocating that surgeons should use the method of frozen sleep instead of anesthetics when performing surgery to make patients lose consciousness. Because, he said, using anesthetics to make patients fall asleep often damages their nerves. As for using the method of frozen sleep, it can not only avoid the above shortcomings, but also be beneficial to the patient.

According to Dr. Parker, the frozen sleep method has long been applied in Harvard laboratories, and he has experimented on various animals. He feels that this method can also be applied to humans. The patient's body is surrounded by ice packs and rubber rings, and ice water circulates in it. The doctor gradually lowers the patient's body temperature until they enter a state of suspended animation, and then performs the incision. When the surgery is over, the patient's body is slowly warmed up.

Dr. Parker also said that frozen sleep also has considerable therapeutic power for malignant tumors, so when cutting out malignant tumors, the frozen sleep method should be used to replace anesthetics. After the patient undergoes frozen sleep, the body will not feel any discomfort at all, and some people have seen improvements in their health after trying frozen sleep for a considerable period of time.

### A Casual Discussion of "Martial Actors" on Shanghai's Stages (1)

— Sui Jingchun

Recently, the martial actors in Shanghai's theaters are the most complete in terms of talent at the Great Stage and the Co-op Stage, followed by the New Tianchan Theater and the Carlton Theater. Golden stage only has one martial actress, Yan Shishan, who is extremely popular. Xiao San Mazi specializes in playing Guan Yu plays, and although there are one or two martial actors, they are all second or third rate, without much reputation. However, martial actors are divided into long-robe and short-fighting types. People like He Yueshan and Li Chunlai in the past were all good at short-fighting plays; they were certainly capable of long-robe plays, but in order to show the special characteristics of short-fighting, they were often unwilling to perform them, so as not to lose their reputation. Today's Gai Jiaotian is also second to none among short-fighting martial actors. His performance of "Evil Tiger Village" can be called unparalleled. Only Bai Yukun in previous years could still compete with Gai in this play. Now that Gai is old at the age of four, he is unable to perform due to illness, and Yukun is drifting and down and out, even more different than before. As for those who are good at long-robe martial actors, we should recommend Yang Xiaolou, Shang Heyu and others. Today's Li Wanchun, Li Xiaochun, (it is said that after Xiao Chunqiu cools down, he will join Tianchan) and Yang Ruiting, Bai Yukun, etc. are all outstanding talents. (Now Bai and Yang are both old and not as spectacular as before). Today, in the martial actor industry, many specialize in short-fighting, but all martial actors, if they do not have special skills, will not be respected. Otherwise, it is difficult to have a place. Now I will write about the martial actors who have a reputation on the current stages in this city one by one, which I think is what the average drama lover would like to hear! However, omissions are inevitable. In addition, the Shanghai Drama School has many young children, only ten years old, who specialize in martial actor plays, short-fighting and armed, and are proficient in everything. Their skills are very impressive and they are promising talents. I will omit their names because I cannot remember them, but it is also worth introducing them to the readers. I will add a note here.

Wang Yingwu He came to Shanghai with Gao Qingkui and performed at Tianchan, hanging up the second plaque. His popularity was so strong that he overwhelmed Gao, which can also be said to be Wang's most popular period. Later, because he was often enthusiastic with the opposite sex, his skills regressed without progress, and he fell into a slump. Although he is now a basic actor at Carlton, looking back at the past, I believe he is not without feeling. However, his skills are indeed not ambiguous and can be watched, compared with Carlton's newly hired female performers Dong Xia and Dong Ming as pillars, his plays are not performed every night due to the repertoire.

Li Zhonglin Li Zhonglin, formerly known as Xiao Xiao Gui Yuan, took over the role of Sun Wukong in "Journey to the West" at the Great Stage after Zhang Yipeng stopped performing, and continued to perform "The Legend of the Immortal Swordsman" until now. His reputation has not diminished. According to Li's skills, he has a lot of hard work, and he has also stayed in Harbin, Liaoning and other ports for several years, which has made his progress more apparent. Now it is even more magical. Although his appearance is not very flattering, his height is outstanding, like a jade tree facing the wind, so he is convenient and lively in all actions in martial dramas. This is a major reason for his advantage, and it is also something that other martial actors cannot match. Plays such as "Purple Bamboo Forest", "Killing Four Gates", and "Lin Chong's Night Flight" are indeed worth watching many times, but if he plays long-robe plays, his appearance is unsightly, so I dare not compliment him.

Chapter 12 As Helpless as Ning Wuzi

Zhou Yuji heard that Zhang Lie's words were not unreasonable, so he gathered his troops, still having one thousand several hundred people. Because there were no bandits at the east gate, he opened the east gate and charged out from the east gate. In the middle of the night, he could not distinguish the terrain, but only retreated to a deserted place. Looking back at the city of Daizhou, the white smoke and firelight reflected in the sky were all red, and the fire was raging. Thinking of the tragic slaughter of bandits there, Zhou Yuji felt a pang of sadness in his heart on his horse, and with a "wow", he opened his mouth and spit out two drops of fresh blood, almost falling from the saddle. Xu Jing supported him from the side. After running for several miles, the ambush soldiers in the forest suddenly attacked, dividing Zhou Yuji's troops into two halves. It was Full Sky Star Jia Yang. Zhou Yuji, Xu Jing, and Zhang Lie fought desperately, breaking through the siege. However, Fan City was already submerged in the chaotic army and could not go together. He was hit by three knives, but he still waved the knife in his hand and fought the bandit soldiers to the death. He killed several more bandit soldiers in a row. Jia Yang caught up, and Fan Cheng's strength was exhausted. The horse he was sitting on was stabbed by Jia Yang, so he had to dismount and fight hard. Knowing that he could not escape, he was unwilling to be humiliated by the bandits, so he drew his knife and committed suicide. Zhou Yuji and others fled for their lives all night before arriving at Ningwu Pass. ××× There was a guerrilla Wang Weiguo leading a thousand soldiers stationed there. He had long heard of the police report from Daizhou and repeatedly wanted to go to rescue, but he did not dare to leave his post far away because the pass was empty. He often looked forward to it in his heart. Hearing that Daizhou had been lost and General Zhou Yuji had retreated here in defeat, he hurriedly led his troops out of the pass to meet Zhou Yuji and enter the city. Wang Weiguo had a dark complexion, a tall body, and great strength. He was in his prime and was known for his bravery. He was someone that Zhou Yuji had promoted. When they met, they were both distressed. Zhou Yuji immediately ordered Xu Jing, Zhang Lie, and Wang Weiguo to guard the pass to prevent the bandits from taking advantage of the victory to attack. He took a few servants and ran to his private residence, dismounted and took off his armor, and went to visit his old mother. Zhou Yuji's mother was already over seventy years old, with white hair all over her head, tooth decay, and a hunched back. That day, she was sitting in the middle hall with her daughter-in-law, Liu, and her grandson, thinking of her son. The old lady also knew that the bandits were rampant and would come to invade sooner or later, so her son was stationed in Daizhou and had no time to return to greet her and see her meals, but she did not know that Daizhou had been besieged by the bandits. Although Zhou Yuji's wife, Liu, knew about it, Zhou Yuji's family letter also entrusted her to comfort the old mother, but she was afraid that her mother-in-law would be frightened, so she temporarily concealed the news. Unexpectedly, Zhou Yuji returned in defeat, and this matter could not be concealed sooner or later.

### British Embassy Hosts Benefit Song and Dance Performance

The British Embassy plans to hold a song and dance gala in the near future, including the British song and dance troupe that previously performed at the Lyceum and foreign celebrities from this city. The purpose of this event is to raise funds to help Shanghai's refugee children. The embassy believes that the theater is too small to accommodate a large number of audiences, so it plans to hold the event at Zhangyuan Yuhuayuan on Jing'an Temple Road.
