The Ministry of Education, Health, and Social Welfare have also been combined into one department. The Minister of Justice will be concurrently held by the President of the Supreme Court.

Shintomi was the commander of a certain cruiser and was appointed commander of the Japanese fleet in South China in October of this year.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - Sir Young, Governor of Hong Kong and Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Hong Kong, has gone to Kowloon and will meet with the Japanese authorities at the Peninsula Hotel to discuss the terms of surrender and other issues related to the surrender.

All radio stations stopped broadcasting regular programs to announce the Japanese army's victory and broadcast military songs.

Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - Among the Japanese soldiers participating in the battle of Hong Kong, there was a "specially trained swimming force" that braved British artillery fire and swam across Lei Yue Mun, which is 1,000 meters wide and has underwater mines. The Japanese army used rifles to shoot at the underwater mines to cause them to explode before landing in Hong Kong.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - Kawabata, a spokesman for the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters Army, delivered a broadcast speech the day before yesterday, explaining the importance of Hong Kong's surrender.

The defending soldiers and volunteers totaled 22,000.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - On the 18th day after the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Japanese army occupied Hong Kong. The fall of the island not only meant that Britain lost its last base on Chinese territory but also lost the empire's most important trading center. After the "Opium War" in January 1841, China ceded Hong Kong to Britain, which was confirmed by the Treaty of Nanjing in August 1842. After the Second Opium War, the Kowloon Peninsula was again forced to be ceded to Britain. In 1898, Britain obtained a 99-year lease on the area north of the Shenzhen River and the surrounding islands of Hong Kong. Hong Kong currently has a population of about one million and is heavily fortified, forming a triangular defense center with Singapore and Darwin. Hong Kong is the main base for the British fleet in China. Hong Kong is not only an important military location and a first-class naval port but also a world trade center. In 1937, trade reached 50 million pounds. The island is located at the mouth of the Pearl River and controls all of Southern China's commerce.

### De Gaulle's Forces Occupy Two Islands South of Newfoundland; Vichy Lodges Strong Protest with the US

Havas News Agency, New York, 25th - It is learned that four warships belonging to the French De Gaulle faction have occupied the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.

The capital is the city of Saint Pierre, which has submarine cables connecting to both Europe and America.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 26th - According to a London dispatch, the "Free French Committee" in London announced yesterday that De Gaulle's forces have occupied the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon south of Newfoundland.

He landed De Gaulle's forces on the ships, which occupied the island's administrative organs. These two islands have been occupied by France since 1635. There are no troops stationed on the island. The southern island has an area of approximately 341 square kilometers. After occupying the island, the De Gaulle faction will hold a referendum so that the 5,000 residents of the island can freely decide their inclinations.

Havas News Agency, Washington, 25th - The French Ambassador to the United States, Henry-Haye, learned that the French De Gaulle faction had occupied the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon and lodged a strong protest with the US government.

Neither the British nor Americans Agreed

Reuters News Agency, Washington, 25th (Relayed by Chongqing) - The Free French forces occupied Saint Pierre and Miquelon Islands without obtaining the consent of the US government beforehand. The US State Department issued a statement today stating that the actions of the so-called three Free French warships at Saint Pierre and Miquelon were arbitrary actions that violated agreements made by all relevant parties, and were not notified to the US government or obtained any consent from the US government beforehand. The State Department also received a telegram from Ottawa stating that the Canadian government was also unaware of the Free French's actions beforehand. The government is now preparing to restore the original state of the two islands.

Reuters News Agency, London, 25th (Relayed by Chongqing) - The negative repercussions of the Free French occupation of Saint Pierre and Miquelon Islands have become the focus of discussion among London political figures. What the British find most strange is that the actions of the Free French naval commander Muselier were not approved by the US government or notified to the US government. According to reliable sources, the British government is also surprised by Muselier's actions. This complicated situation seems to require considerable time to clarify. The fleet led by Muselier did not sail from British ports.

### Lavish Christmas Banquets in Vichy Have Disappeared; The Entire Nation is Concerned About French Prisoners

Havas News Agency, Vichy, 25th - Today marks the second Christmas since the armistice between France and Germany. The general situation here is quite serious, without extravagance, and full of hope. The issue that the entire nation is most concerned about is the issue of French prisoners. Although some seriously wounded and those with many children have been released and returned home, the majority of prisoners are still detained in German concentration camps. Marshal Pétain specifically mentioned this matter in his Christmas address, which is sufficient to reflect the mood of the French people. At the same time, hundreds of French prisoners were also sent back from Italy last week as a result of the recent meeting between Assistant Darlan and the Italian Foreign Minister in Turin. The 233 sailors of the French ship "Saint Dieudonne," who were detained in Turkey when the ship sank, also returned home on Christmas Eve. The son of Colonial Minister Boisson was among them. After Marshal Pétain's speech yesterday, the hope that French prisoners will continue to be sent back home has emerged. The lavish banquets of Christmas in previous years have disappeared due to the lack of food sources. Only a few toys are seen on the market, but their production is still relatively clever. The raw materials for toy manufacturing, such as cloth, metal products, and rubber, are no longer available, so toy makers have had to use their ingenuity to invent substitutes. Restaurants and cafes closed at midnight yesterday as usual but did not prepare Christmas dinners. At 8:00 p.m., crowds went to various churches to hold midnight Mass. The Saint-Véran Church in the Alps also broadcast Mass via wireless, as the church is famous for being located at the highest point in Europe. On Christmas Day, approximately 1,000 children aged 12 to 15 came to Vichy from various parts of the occupied zone and the free zone, representing students from all over the country, to pay their respects to Marshal Pétain.

Havas News Agency, Washington, 26th -

French Ambassador to the United States, Henry-Haye, hosted the children of embassy staff and American children sympathetic to France on Christmas Eve. During the event, the Ambassador asked all the children to think of the distressed children in France and to unanimously respect Marshal Pétain, saying that Marshal Pétain is the embodiment of French unity.

### Scenes of Rangoon

Rangoon is a large city in Burma, 30 miles from the sea. Ocean-going ships can freely enter and exit, and it has always been the commercial center of Burma. The Yunnan-Burma Highway, China's international transportation line, starts from Kunming and ends in Lashio. From Lashio, the railway that runs straight through Burma reaches Rangoon, and all goods enter and exit through it. Therefore, the port of Rangoon is undoubtedly China's entrepot port. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Rangoon intensified its defenses due to military needs and has entered a wartime state. Burma is also known as the Land of Pagodas. Many pagodas have been built throughout the territory, and the Shwe Dagon Pagoda in Rangoon is particularly famous in the world. Those who travel there consider it fortunate to visit. (See the image above) Rangoon has clean streets and neat houses, with the appearance of a modern city. (See the image below)

### Year-End Summary: Monetary Conditions Easing, Foreign Banks' Deposits Transferred, Not Affecting Native Banks

To stabilize Shanghai's financial market and maintain stability, various Chinese banks and native banks ("Chuang") have organized a temporary committee of the Banking and Native Banking Association. After issuing temporary regulations for the operation of banks and native banks, they have also reached an agreement with Yokohama Specie Bank regarding funds deposited in foreign banks such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Chase Bank. The funds deposited by various banks and native banks in foreign banks will be transferred through Yokohama Specie Bank. Each bank and native bank will open a new account with Yokohama Specie Bank, allowing them to withdraw funds at any time to adjust the market. This has been arranged and is ready for implementation, so the original collateral of the banks and native banks will not be affected in any way. The overall Shanghai financial situation is stabilizing. The temporary operating measures (i.e., deposit and withdrawal methods) will be lifted as soon as monetary conditions ease.

Regulations Set for Opening Reserve Accounts: Native Banks Prepare to Open Fixed Accounts. Each native bank will open a new cash account with the Native Bank Reserve, starting from the 21st of December and will be required to use cash account checkbooks. From the 8th of this month, foreign bank drafts and cash deposited into the Native Bank Reserve will be transferred from the original clearing account to the cash account. Native banks depositing foreign bank drafts and cash into the Native Bank Reserve should stamp the deposit slip with the "Cash Account" seal. Native banks exchanging foreign bank drafts for Native Bank Reserve checks and withdrawing cash should issue a cash account check with the "Cash Account" seal. When foreign banks collect drafts from native banks and exchange them for Native Bank Reserve checks, they should pay with Native Bank Reserve cash checks. The amount of Native Bank Reserve cash account checks issued by native banks is limited to the previous day's balance. Foreign bank drafts paid by native banks cannot be offset on the same day.

Banks and Native Banks Handling Year-End Closing: As the end of the Gregorian year 1941 approaches, banks, native banks, companies, firms, and factories have begun to handle year-end closing. The settlement of interest on commercial reserves, current account balances, and outstanding debts was completed the day before yesterday. Starting yesterday, they have extended their internal office hours to expedite the year-end closing, which will continue until the 31st of this month. From January 1st next year, they will have a four-day holiday including Sunday and New Year's Day. Business will resume on the 5th. Although monetary conditions in the market have decreased slightly compared to before, all industries will be able to safely navigate this year-end closing period.

Period for Year-End Closing Determined: The date for the year-end closing for all industries has been determined and announced by the Native Banking Association as Saturday, February 14th next year (i.e., Lunar New Year's Eve). The procedures for handling business before and after the year-end closing period will be decided upon in a meeting soon. February 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th will be the period for year-end closing, and there will be holidays as usual. Business will resume on February 19th. It is reported that credit loans issued by native banks previously, except for those with contractual stipulations, must be fully repaid before the year-end closing period. After the year-end closing period, new accounts can be opened for business.

### Puji Soup Kitchen to Open Soon

The Puji Soup Kitchen, organized by the Board of Directors of Puji Hospital, previously sold plain rice at 1037 Chengdu Road from the 21st day of the twelfth lunar month to the 20th day of the first month of the lunar new year. Rice was sold twice a day, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, with a limit of 1,000 people each time. Each person was limited to purchasing two catties, at a price of 10 cents per catty. Although it only lasted for one month, it was a practical endeavor and well-received by the common people. It is now reported that the kitchen, recognizing that the livelihood problems of the common people are even more difficult this year than last year, plans to open early on January 1st of the Gregorian calendar at the original location. All times and quantities will follow the same methods as last year. However, the selling price will be 25 cents per catty, as the price of Saigon rice has increased more than double compared to last year, and fuel has increased by four to eight times. The total cost is estimated to be 55 cents per catty. The kitchen has already sent a letter to the General Manager of the Public Works Department, Mr. Felippe, and Mr. He Dequi for review. If approved and if police officers are dispatched to maintain order, the kitchen can open on schedule.

### Public Venues' Business Hours to End at 10 PM Starting Next Year, Electric Signs Prohibited

### Public Works Department Plans to Establish Foreigners' Cafeteria

There are currently thousands of foreigners in the city who, due to business stagnation, will likely face poverty in two or three months. The Public Works Department is studying plans to provide relief to these foreigners. According to responsible individuals, it is now necessary to establish a cafeteria to sell meals at low prices. This measure is urgently needed for foreigners of all nationalities. Public Works Department personnel also urge foreign associations of various countries to proceed in this direction, stating that the department will fully cooperate. However, if the associations organize such cafeterias themselves, the department's task can be greatly reduced. The department's large-scale food distribution program is already very busy, and it is now preparing to provide large-scale relief to both Chinese and foreign poor people. The establishment of low-cost cafeterias or other similar plans should be carried out as soon as possible, as they are of great importance.

### Public Buses to Operate All Day Only on Holidays, Three-Shift System to Continue on Weekdays

Public buses in the Public Concession began operating all day for the past two days, from 7:30 AM to 6:30 PM. It is reported that they will continue to operate all day today and tomorrow as well. It is understood that this change in schedule is due to the Christmas holidays. The bus company authorities, recognizing that traffic is quite busy during the holidays due to public visits to friends and outings, temporarily extended the bus operating hours to facilitate the public, canceling the three-shift system of morning, noon, and evening. The past two days were Christmas holidays. Although today is not a holiday, all-day service is also provided because tomorrow is Sunday. As for the future bus schedule, except for Sundays when all-day service will continue, the three-shift system of morning, noon, and evening will continue to be followed from Monday to Saturday. The morning shift is from 7:30 AM to 9:15 AM, the noon shift is from 12:15 PM to 2:15 PM, and the evening shift is from 4:15 PM to 6:15 PM. It is currently unknown whether public buses will operate all day during the New Year's holiday next year.

### Swiss Consulate to Represent Interests of the United States and the Netherlands, Nationals of Both Countries Can Seek Protection from the Swiss Consulate in Shanghai in Urgent Situations

As Japan is at war with the United States and the Netherlands, Mr. von der Mühll, the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, has been entrusted to represent the interests of the United States and the Netherlands in Shanghai and in all areas occupied by the Japanese army in China. The office for handling the above-mentioned interests of the United States and the Netherlands will take some time to establish. However, all nationals of the United States and the Netherlands can directly apply to the Swiss Consulate General in Shanghai for protection in urgent situations.

### Public Concession's Expenses for Next Year May Reach 100 Million Yuan, Balanced Budget Possible if Expenditures are Reduced

The budget for the Public Concession next year will increase significantly compared to 1941. Although it will not necessarily follow the example of the French Concession's 16-fold increase in expenses for 1942, it is generally believed that the Public Concession's expenses for 1942 will increase by 20 million yuan, estimating that total expenses will reach an unprecedented record high of 100 million yuan. This is calculated based on the municipal expenses of the past few years. Expenses may continue to increase as a result of the current emergency situation, which has not yet been taken into account. The Public Concession's expenses for this year are estimated at 81,052,910 yuan, but actual expenses have reached about 83 million yuan. If expenses continue at the same level as before the Pacific War, the Public Concession's annual expenses would now be about 96 million yuan. As a result of the war, the Public Works Department's income has decreased. If expenditures are also reduced, the two can at least temporarily be expected to offset each other. Therefore, the Public Concession must drastically reduce its expenses (which seems unlikely) or raise taxes or issue new municipal bonds to compensate. It is reported that the Public Works Department has begun to discuss this issue. According to customary practice, the municipal budget for 1942 must be preliminarily completed by mid-February next year. Therefore, the Public Works Department must decide whether to reduce expenses or increase taxes, and then submit the final budget proposal to the Consular Body for a decision.

### Transportation of Coal Exceeding Limit Still Requires a Permit

Stored oil that is not reported will be confiscated without further notice and without compensation.

### French Concession Replaces Iron Wire Fences Along Borders

In order to ensure security within the French Concession, maintain public safety, strengthen winter defenses, and prevent petty criminals from committing crimes, the French Police Department, in addition to dispatching detectives to patrol separately, conducting searches of individuals, and strictly enforcing curfews, is now blocking non-essential roads along the border, leaving only a gap for pedestrians to pass through. For example, along the border of Avenue Edward VII, roads such as Route Grosseille and Route Bayle are being blocked with iron wire fences, leaving a gap of more than a foot wide to allow passage.

### Artificial Butter Factory Resumes Production

In recent months, margarine (artificial butter) has become quite popular in Shanghai, and the number of consumers is increasing daily. The raw materials for margarine are vegetable oil and fats, which are produced in large quantities in China. Even if the large amount of margarine raw materials currently stored in Shanghai is used up, there will still be ample supplies of oils and fats transported to replenish it. This is because the Public Works Department's Oils and Fats Committee has been working very hard for the past two weeks and has obtained the cooperation of the Japanese authorities, and the supply situation of oils and fats has indeed improved. After being temporarily closed, the Huachang Cold Storage Factory on North Bund, Ward Road, reopened on Christmas Eve and resumed manufacturing margarine for distribution in South Bund. It is reported that other margarine factories will also resume work soon.

### Buying or Pledging Bicycles Requires Verification of "Paper Permit," Increasing Number of Bicycle Thefts, Severe Punishment for Receiving Stolen Goods

Due to the increasing number of bicycle thefts in the French Concession recently, the French Police Department has issued another notice to bicycle merchants, pawnshop managers, and used goods dealers that the purchase or pledge of bicycles without a valid guarantee shall not be deemed legal.

If it is found to be stolen goods for sale, it should be reported to the police as soon as possible. In other words, without a bicycle "paper permit," the vehicle shall not be purchased or pledged. If someone is selling or pledging a bicycle and cannot produce a "paper permit," the nearest police station should be notified immediately, and the person should be detained pending the arrival of police personnel. If a bicycle without a "paper permit" is purchased or pledged and is proven to be stolen, the bicycle will be returned to the owner without compensation, and the buyer or pawnshop manager will be prosecuted for the crime of receiving stolen goods under Article 349 of the Criminal Code.

Bicycle Parking Areas Are Being Hastily Arranged

The French Concession is currently rushing to build a number of bicycle parking areas, which will be located at the following locations: Intersection of Rue du Cardinal Mercier and Avenue Dubail (gas station), intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour and Avenue Dubail (gas station), 1852 Avenue Dubail (gas station), Avenue Albert (in front of the Jai Alai stadium), Avenue du Marechal Foch (opposite the Cathay Theatre), French Lawn Tennis Association, 77 Avenue Dubail (gas station), southwest corner of Avenue Dubail and Rue Massenet, northeast corner of Avenue Dubail and Route Pére Robert, Route Vallon (in front of the French Club), French Concession Bund (south of the Observatory). Each of the above parking stations will be guarded by a police officer. To avoid errors or exchanges, those who park their bicycles should observe the following regulations: Bicycles should be equipped with locks, chains, etc. to ensure safety. Before retrieving the bicycle, the "paper permit" should be presented to the guard police officer. After verifying that the number on the "paper permit" matches the number on the hard porcelain license plate on the bicycle, the vehicle can be returned. This method will be managed by private enterprises when possible.

### Wang Ruilong Invents Mini Soccer

Inviting Four Teams for Public Trial Tomorrow

One-Third Smaller Than Mini Soccer: Mr. Wang Ruilong, president of the Ruilong Sports Association, recognizing the difficulty of finding island soccer fields in the future and the lack of interest in small rubber balls, has invented a kind of mini soccer. The ball's diameter is one-third smaller than a mini soccer ball, making it easier to run around on small fields. The rubber bladder and leather shell are the same construction as a soccer ball. The East China Sports Equipment Company has been commissioned to customize this new type of mini soccer. However, at the beginning, it is still necessary to test and select the ball's style, size, suitability, and weight. For the sake of public discussion, Mr. Wang has invited Yiguang, Shisheng, Hongxing, and Ruilong to hold a maiden trial of mini soccer at the Guangxia Middle School field tomorrow (Sunday) at 2:00 PM. Guangxia has not been a small soccer field and is not suitable for mini soccer, but at present, Guangxia has become the only remaining field. This new invention will not only be suitable for the Guangxia field but will also create a groundbreaking record for Guangxia. The trial schedule is as follows:

Ruilong vs. Hongxing 2:00 PM
Yiguang vs. Shisheng 3:00 PM

### Business News

After Continuous Sharp Declines, the Yarn Market Suddenly Turns Upward. It is Rumored that Shuangma and Futures Will Be Settled at Prices, and the Exchange is Expected to Resume Operations Soon

The cotton yarn market has turned upward. This is because of the sharp declines in recent days, coupled with good news and the rebound in gold prices. Buyers have become eager, and the bulls are stable. As a result, prices have risen by 120 yuan, and transactions have shown improvement. The initial price for 20-count Shuangma factory yarn was 1,570 yuan. As buyers continued to come, the market gradually advanced to 1,690 yuan, an increase of 130-140 yuan compared to the previous day. Some profit-takers sold in the middle, and the price eased back to 1,680 yuan. Finally, it rebounded to 1,690 yuan at the close. Transactions were lively. The trading volume of Shuangma factory yarn alone was about 250 bales or more. The price of 20-count Tiannv factory yarn was 1,700 yuan. The spot price on the floor was 2,400 yuan, a difference of 700 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Yueqin was 1,800 yuan, up to 1,800 yuan. The factory yarn was 1,820 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix was 2,300 yuan, and the factory yarn for 42-count Phoenix was 3,500 yuan, with a spot price of 3,650 yuan.

Regarding the method for settling the Shuangma factory yarn contracts on the Exchange, a certain party has studied a practical closing method, which is still to adopt settlement at prices, the same step as the Exchange. It is likely to be based on the closing price of 2,190 yuan on the 6th, and the longs and shorts will settle at that price.

The situation of the Jin Shuangma futures has been dull for many days. Although there were rumors of settlement at prices, it has not been implemented. Now that Blue Phoenix and Caiqiu are about to be settled at prices, and there are rumors of settlement at prices for factory yarn, the Jin Shuangma trend may follow. However, there is no definite news on how to do it and it is said to be still under discussion.

The issue of the Exchange resuming operations is expected to be before January 10 next year. There may be changes in the operating guidelines. Currently, the unit of yarn and cloth is 25 bales. It is said that in order to achieve wider adoption, it may be changed to 10 bales as a unit. However, it must be reviewed and approved before a decision can be made.

### Cloth Market Still Lacks a Firm Basis, Spot Eastern Cloth is Being Absorbed

There were few transactions in the factory cloth market yesterday. Prices of various cloths still lack a firm basis. White goods, 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth, was 98-99 yuan. There were few transactions in other grades of coarse and fine cloth, and the asking prices were very chaotic. The price difference between the factory price and the spot price of bleached and dyed cloth was also nearly 10 yuan. 70-80 pieces were traded on this street.

Yesterday, the market for Eastern cloth rose after falling due to foreign firms buying spot goods. The market atmosphere gradually stabilized. The spot price of Longtou fine cloth was sold at 71 yuan, and the factory price was 70 yuan. Other fine cloth brands such as Caiqiu, Feiyu, and Yanghe were all traded at 65 yuan. The price of Labatong Wufu was 64 yuan. Firms absorbed 200-300 bales. The price of Sijunzi serge stacker board fell to a minimum of 2.3 yuan the day before yesterday. Yesterday, it rebounded to 2.4 yuan due to purchases from the northern gang. The asking price for spot serge was 2.44 yuan. Over one hundred cases were also traded on this street, and the situation turned bullish.

### Miscellaneous Grains Trading Still Brisk

Transactions of miscellaneous grains were scattered yesterday. However, local demand on this street was still good, so the market trend was generally slightly bullish. The prices are as follows: Qingdao raw oil was 370 yuan, Dalian soybean oil was 367.5-368.5 yuan, Dayou factory clear oil was 237-235 yuan, rapeseed oil was 253-255 yuan, Tianjin new Jinyuan was 92-94 yuan, old Jinyuan was 88-90 yuan, green beans were 81.5 yuan, tea beans were 71 yuan, Chongming sand silkworm was 50 yuan, sand red was 78 yuan, Jiading white silkworm was 72.5 yuan, Benniu red beans were 75 yuan, Saigon new corn was 43.5-46 yuan, Peidong stack was 42 yuan, and Yinghua Szuhai spot was 78 yuan.

### Rice Prices Gradually Decrease

The source of domestic rice, ever since the market stopped, suddenly saw a large surplus, no less than four hundred stones, so people's hearts were stable, and market prices gradually fell. Kunshan white japonica rice sold for 235 yuan, thin rice for 225 yuan to 218 yuan, early rice with bags for 230 yuan, without bags for 224 yuan, and Danyang white rice for 225 yuan. If, according to this situation, the source of domestic rice continues to arrive, the selling price may return to around 200 yuan in the short term, which would also be a blessing for the people's food supply. As for imported rice, before free trade is restored, although the authorities are trying to make public sales of rice widespread, the limited purchase quantity is too small, and families with larger populations often feel they cannot eat their fill. Therefore, the crowding in front of stores has not subsided to this day. It is hoped that the authorities will quickly improve the rice purchase method so that people's food supply can be stabilized as soon as possible. The cheap rice sales in Nantao have also been interrupted for several days. Although there is talk of continued arrivals and sales tomorrow, ordinary people without overnight grain have felt extremely distressed, and it is deeply hoped that remedies will be quickly implemented so that the people's food supply is not interrupted intermittently, so that residents can feel at ease and without worry.

Small quantities of imported rice have not been traded because the counter-offer from buyers was too low, and the sellers were unwilling to sell at a loss due to the large difference in cost. It was previously rumored that orders for Vietnamese rice and Wu xiang rice were underway in different directions. However, in the Shanghai West area, public sales have begun as Wu xiang cargo continues to arrive. Since Hong Kong was occupied by the Japanese army, there is no problem with the source of Annam Siam rice. As long as there is a way to transport it, the panic over food in Shanghai can be eliminated.

### Cash Returns to the 10,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the second day of the winter solstice holiday for Chinese and foreign banks in this city, Chinese commercial banks and money shops were open as usual. Under the initiative of a bank affiliated with a certain two money shops, cash transactions were quite active. The initial price was 9,800 yuan per bar (ten taels). After absorption by a certain bank and cash houses, the price immediately rose, reaching a high of 10,500 yuan. Soon after, the money shops helped to sell, falling back to 10,100 to 10,200 yuan. At 11:15, it rose again to 10,400 yuan. At noon, there was more selling, and it immediately fell, with the final price at 10,000 yuan, which was 500 yuan higher than the final transaction price of the previous day (the 24th). The exchange price of gold ornaments per tael rose 50 yuan at 11:00 at Da Xin and other peers, to 1,150 yuan. At noon, it fell back, still at 1,100 yuan (purchase reduced by 200 yuan). Standard silver was still listed at 16 yuan, and the black market was around 10 yuan.

### Public Bond Market Slightly More Liquidations, People's Hearts Are Not Easily Peaceful

Over-the-counter trading of public bonds yesterday still involved mutual liquidations of buying and selling. This was because brokers were urging the closure of account transactions for various clients, and they had no choice but to liquidate. Brokers also had to seek payment from their clients because banks were urging the redemption of pledges. Therefore, the liquidation prices were inconsistent and quite chaotic, with selling being cheap and buying being expensive. Class C bonds once traded at a low of 52 yuan, while another party traded at 53 or 54 yuan. Considering the overall market, the highest price was roughly 55 yuan and 10 cents, and the lowest was 51 yuan. Class A bonds traded at a low of 57 yuan, and the high price also reached 58 yuan and a half. Class B bonds traded at 56 yuan, Class E bonds at 54 yuan, and Class D bonds at 51 to 50 yuan. Except for Class D bonds, which fell significantly, most other types were similar to the official market prices on the 23rd. People's hearts are still uneasy, and those holding goods are worried. There is no definite date for the market to recover.

### Vermicelli and Noodles Fall Back

Recently, the sale of vermicelli and noodles has been relatively rare, and peers are competing to sell, dumping their inventory, resulting in a drop of more than 30 yuan. Yesterday, Longkou noodles sold for 300 yuan, followed by Qingdao noodles for 270 yuan. The market may continue to loosen.

### Nantang Gorgon Fruit Slightly Looser

Nantang gorgon fruit is one of the best tonic supplements and is highly favored by people. Due to the disruption of shipping routes, it cannot be transported, and the area has seen unprecedented high prices. However, this product is usually sold through the stomach and the market is soft. It is currently selling for 480 yuan, which is lower than before.

### A Match

— Qin Ren

These are two things I saw on the tram: a young man in a suit took a very beautiful cigarette case with a lighter from his pocket, but after putting the cigarette to his lips, he struck the lighter three or four times, and only saw a tiny spark (truly just a spark). It turned out it was empty! He looked around, but there was no one smoking, so he resentfully put the cigarette back into the case.

A middle-aged man who looked like a businessman had just lit a cigarette with a match when a passenger next to him hurriedly put on a smiling face and said to him, "Excuse me, can I have a match?" The middle-aged man glared at him and reluctantly handed over the cigarette in his hand (whether it was because he thought it was bad luck, heaven knows!), and stuffed the matchbox into his pocket.

The young man in the suit probably rarely has the opportunity to use matches. If he usually goes out in a car, using a gallon of gasoline to deal with that beautiful cigarette case with a lighter, he would never have a day when he couldn't light a cigarette in his life. Chinese businessmen use offering cigarettes and lighting them as a way to connect in business. Some businesses even have apprentices specifically for offering cigarettes and lighting them for customers. Even if a stranger asks for a match on the street or in a car, it is common, easy, and certain to be met with a smiling face and extreme humility. But now, he was glared at!

Changes in the environment can shift customs, but having already abandoned the car for the tram, why is he still unwilling to part with a lighter cigarette case? Having already been stingy with a match, why light a cigarette first? My meaning is naturally not limited to cigarettes, but this is a good example.

### Broken Rice Vendor

— Dong Guo

"Broken rice for sale!"

In the gloomy sky, in the short alley, waves of mournful cries of broken rice vendors.

In the gloomy sky, on the main street, lines of people crowding to buy imported rice.

This contradictory world, this deformed society; this suffocating air, this depressing time!

A family of three committed suicide due to lack of food; the corner of the street is filled with the stench of rotting corpses of starvation victims; at the entrance of the alley, women and children are crying, "We're starving to death!"

"Broken rice for sale!"

The broken rice vendor, like a snail, bent over by a bag of imported rice, crawls, crawls, passes through the crowded lines, steps over the rotting corpses, shouting on every street and in every alley.

The beggar casts an envious glance at the rice vendor:

"Please, give me a little rice!"

The rice vendor sits down on the stone steps of a foreign house, puts down the rice bag, rubs his tired legs, stares at the light smoke coming out of the pot at the food stall, and swallows his saliva.

After walking all day, shouting all day, not a drop of water has entered his mouth, not a grain of rice has gone into his stomach.

When the sky is slightly bright, the broken rice vendor hurries out of the thatched shed, crosses the warning line, and rushes to the place to sell broken rice - Xujiahui, Caohejing, like a prisoner escaping from prison, focusing all their visual and auditory senses, listening for whether they will be allowed to cross safely ahead. They pray in their hearts for the god of destiny to grant the most pitiful luck.

Why? For the sake of food for the whole family, for the most basic life, enduring hardship, risking danger, using broken rice at 18 yuan per dou to exchange for a harvest of 24 yuan per dou, and still having to go hungry to the streets and alleys to sell it.

The broken rice vendor who doesn't even have broken rice to eat!

This contradictory world, this deformed society; this suffocating air, this depressing time!

In the gloomy sky, on the main street, lines of people crowding to buy imported rice.

In the gloomy sky, in the short alley, waves of mournful cries of broken rice vendors.

"Broken rice for sale!"

### Legal Restrictions on Electricity Use by Merchants

— Mu Ne

The French Concession Electricity Company's method of restricting the use of electricity has been decided and will be implemented from the tenth of this month. (Editor's Note: The Municipal Council approved another restriction on electricity distribution two days ago.) The content of this method is roughly that from this day on, the electricity consumption of each household should be reduced to 80% of the "average reference electricity consumption" (i.e., the average electricity consumption of the four months with the highest electricity consumption in the past twelve months). If this amount is exceeded, a penalty of 25 times the fee will be charged.

In today's extreme fuel shortage, we naturally strongly agree with this method of the French Concession authorities, but we believe that the percentage of reduction is still debatable, because the extent to which each household can reduce electricity consumption is different. For example, some people play mahjong and poker all night, and the objective utility of electricity to them is small, and the possibility of saving electricity is high, so the percentage of reduction should be increased. Some people already go to bed early and get up early, saving as much as possible. If they have to reduce their electricity consumption, it simply hinders their legitimate right to enjoy public utilities. Therefore, a better method is to determine the maximum amount of electricity consumption based on the size of each household and the number of people, as a restriction. We wonder what the French Concession authorities think of this?

Furthermore, the buildings in the concession are small and the population is large, and many families often live in one building and share one electricity meter. Therefore, if the electricity consumption exceeds the limit and a fine is imposed, the apportionment of this fine becomes a problem. On the surface, it seems that a mutually agreed apportionment ratio can solve the problem, but in fact, it is not so. In today's Shanghai, where second landlords are rampant, second landlords often only use electric fans, electric stoves, electric irons, and radios, while third tenants are not allowed to use anything. Some landlady only knows to scold the third tenant for using too many lights day and night, but allows the maidservants and elder sisters to keep the lights on all night while sleeping. In this situation, can the apportionment ratio be fairly determined? In order to remedy this problem, the author advocates that all residents should jointly negotiate an agreement stipulating the electrical appliances that can be used and the time to turn off the lights. If there is a violation, increase the apportionment ratio (excluding those with special reasons). At the same time, it is hoped that the concession authorities will organize arbitration bodies to handle such matters.

In addition, we also hope that second landlords will return the electricity bills saved by saving electricity to third tenants, so that the rent is fair and those who save electricity are encouraged.

### 15. Dad, Let's Go Busking!

It was the little fat guy with the visible nape of his neck who was actually only a third drunk, far from being completely drunk. When he heard Qiu Haitang scold him, he revealed a very cunning look, smiled coldly, and stood up from his seat.

"I bet you're just a few paupers, why are you scolding people first?"

"Sir, it's not that we want to scold people, it's just that you're saying things that are too unpleasant!" Mr. Han first handed the erhu in his hand to his daughter, hurriedly turned around, blocked the little Li who had already rushed forward, intending to help him and send him back to his original seat.

Unexpectedly, the little fat guy with the visible nape of his neck was really a bad egg.

"Okay, you still want to hit people?" He suddenly jumped up, forcefully grabbed Mr. Han's chest, and at the same time shouted loudly to Little Li, "Charlie, don't let them go, go attack that old bastard!" (290)

### Remembering Ouyang from All Corners of the World

— Su Bai

Among the national drama artists who are proficient in Peking opera and also search for performers, there are very few, but Ouyang Yuqian can be regarded as the only remaining one, which is undoubtedly the case. Ouyang is good at Qingyi, his expression is delicate, his appearance is graceful, and he once stood shoulder to shoulder with Mei Lanfang in fame in the north and south, hence the title "Southern Ouyang Northern Mei".

In the early Republic of China, Ouyang was hired by the Nantong Linggong School to perform at the Gengsu Theater, in collaboration with Zhang Yueting, Zhao Tongshan, Cha Tianying and others. Zhao Tongshan's singing and acting were extremely profound, and his performance on the same stage as Ouyang can be called the icing on the cake. Ouyang's plays should be the most refined in "The Palace of Eternal Life - Steamed Bun Nunnery", "The Peach Blossom on the Human Face" and "King Goujian of Yue". Without the work of grinding and polishing the above-mentioned plays, no one would dare to perform them easily. Looking at the current Lingjie, no one performs them anymore!

The Tongdi opera fans have many confidants. The Lingjie's every move is well-known to every household and used as a topic of conversation. And the admiration for Ouyang's art is to the best of praise. A certain lyricist and opera fan once wrote poems and lyrics praising the role and published them in newspapers. The first rhyme was quite smooth and amusing. The poem says: "Idle and idle, I go out of the South Gate, I often go to the Gengsu Theater, Two actors are really outstanding, Ouyang Yuqian and Zhao Tongshan." At that time, Ouyang was hired to preside over the Nantong Linggong School (Yan Wan, Zhou Fengwen, and Huang Ren also served as teachers at the Linggong School), but after a short time, the school was discontinued due to some reason.

Ouyang has a deep understanding of dramatic literature, and is especially fascinated by the study of new literature. Later, he directed film dramas and started the cause of Peking opera improvement: he formed the "China Art Troupe" and performed in the renewal. He successively compiled "The Fisherman's Hate", "The Peach Blossom Fan" and "A New Yutang Spring" and other dramas, eliminating the dross and retaining the essence, and fully utilized stage skills, which is no less than laying a foundation for improving Peking opera. The "Good Sisters," "Wen Sucheng," and "Consort Xiang's Hate" and other dramas before not long ago were all deeply rendered.

After the war, I heard that he wandered in the southwest and occasionally stayed in Hong Kong Island. He never relaxed in his pursuit of drama research, but the sound of incense and daughter for the cause of Peking opera improvement!

### A Record of First Attempts at Acting

— Feng Ge Zhu

I am fond of songs, especially addicted to Kunqu opera. I always think I'm clumsy, so I haven't thought about dressing up on stage. One day, Li Jun Jiali of the Jin She Amateur Troupe, at the strong invitation of a friend, suddenly appeared to perform the Guizhi in "A Strange Double Meeting". Because the preparation was not proper beforehand, there was nothing good at the scene. What's more, it was the first time to try the stage, and there were concerns about looking after one thing and losing another. The stage was extremely narrow that day, so there was a lot of work to be done in terms of stage steps, and it was also more convenient to respond to the scene. When I first came out, I looked around and saw everyone's eyes focused on me, and I felt timid. The introduction was so low that I could barely hear it. Chuan Yingjun immediately told me to raise my voice, so I sang boldly. Fortunately, I usually practice my throat diligently, so I can get by. In terms of movements, it is necessary to be in line with the singing and recitation, and the hands and eyes must also be fully focused. I know that the so-called experience of "no self on stage" is not entirely true. Opera emphasizes form. If you transform yourself into the character in the play, in terms of expression, there should be no self, but in terms of action, it is impossible to have no self. The plot of "A Strange Double Meeting" has many inconsistencies, but it is vivid and able to integrate the audience. If the performers are proper, it is worth seeing. (Thank You Gift)

Chapter 20. Lighting Candles to Welcome Us on the Battlefield

Yuan Yuan said, "Isn't that so? There is a number in between, and it is appropriate that the humble concubine's fate palace should suffer some tribulations, and even to this point. Otherwise, if I had gone with the general, wouldn't that be good"? San Gui said, "This is all the fault of that old man. If he hadn't stopped me at that time, I would have taken you with me. So why would I have allowed you to suffer such hardships in the besieged city? It is his own fault that he died in Li Chuang's hands, and I am not sad at all. I only hope that you can briefly describe to me the situation after we parted." Yuan Yuan said sadly, "These things make me sad and ashamed when I mention them," so she told the story of how she fell into the hands of the despicable, and how she persuaded Li Chuang to leave her behind, in a rough way. When Wu Sangui heard Yuan Yuan skillfully coaxing Li Chuang and Li Chuang falling for the trick, he couldn't help but patted Yuan Yuan's fragrant shoulder and said, "You are wiser than others. How could that fool not fall into your trap? You are wise and have bright teeth. If you were a man, wouldn't you be a descendant of Liang Ping"? When Yuan Yuan heard San Gui's words, she couldn't help but smile through her tears, resting her pretty head on San Gui's shoulder, her fragrant cheeks gently touching San Gui's lower jaw. The sound of the carriage rumbled, and the sound of horses' hooves echoed. After walking together, they had reached the jade tent. Hearing the sound of drums and music in his ears, Yuan Yuan peeked out of the carriage, only to see flags and banners all around, brocaded flowers and clusters. Such a grand welcome really made her feel extremely grateful. The car arrived at the treasure tent. Slowly stopping the reins, San Gui helped Yuan Yuan get out of the car. At this time, Yuan Yuan was both shy and surprised, her face full of tears, printing out residual red. San Gui looked at her and loved her even more. In the center of the treasure tent, two arm-thick crimson candles were lit, the candlelight swayed red, and the joy was full. San Gui asked with a smile, "Look at these red candles burning high. Today, I and you are reunited in a jade tent on the battlefield in a good night. A supplementary wedding ceremony is being held. It can be said that it is unprecedented. Are you happy or not"? Yuan Yuan said softly, "This is all thanks to the general. The humble concubine survived the tiger's mouth, and I dare not take this honor." San Gui said, "Don't mention the past. It is no accident that the broken mirror is reunited. It is not enough to express my love for you." (250)
