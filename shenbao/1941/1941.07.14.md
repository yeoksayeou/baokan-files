### Soviet Ambassador Visits Roosevelt, Meeting Lasts One Hour

TASS, Washington, 13th - Yesterday, Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Oumansky, met with President Roosevelt and Mr. Welles at the White House. The meeting lasted for one hour. Afterwards, Mr. Oumansky told reporters, "I, on behalf of my government, express my gratitude for the position taken by President Roosevelt and the American government this time. President Roosevelt's friendly attitude and far-sightedness have deeply impressed me. As for the types of goods the Soviet Union is purchasing from the United States, I have already informed the American government."

### Common Goal of Resisting Nazism: Britain and the Soviet Union Establish Mutual Assistance Agreement. Both Sides Guarantee Not to Make Peace Separately, and to Provide Each Other with Maximum Assistance During the War.

Reuters, London, 13th - The British Foreign Office issued a formal statement saying that the British and Soviet governments have concluded a joint action agreement, the content of which is as follows: (1) Both governments undertake to provide each other with all kinds of assistance and support in the current war against Germany under Hitler's rule. (2) Both sides undertake that during the war, they shall not separately negotiate or conclude ceasefire agreements and peace treaties without mutual consent. The statement also said that both parties have agreed that this agreement will take effect from the time of signing and does not require ratification procedures. This agreement was concluded on the evening of July 12 and signed by British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on behalf of the two governments. The agreement is written in both English and Russian.

Reuters, London, 13th - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that according to sources here, the British government consulted with the governments of all autonomous territories at every stage of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations and kept the American government informed at all times. The conclusion of this joint agreement has formally transformed the already existing state of common belligerency between the two governments into a sacred and inviolable nature. This agreement does not contain any new legal significance of an alliance treaty, but in fact, the two governments have bound each other to provide various assistance and agree not to separately negotiate or conclude ceasefire agreements and peace treaties without mutual consent. The first point mentioned above will facilitate the negotiations currently being conducted in London between British authorities and the Soviet military delegation led by Soviet Deputy Chief of Staff General Golikov. The second point will make the Germans realize that their actions have provoked a united front to deal with them. At present, the respective autonomous territories have jointly declared unanimous agreement. To understand the meaning of this agreement, refer to British Prime Minister Churchill's speech on June 22, which included a passage stating, "Anyone who opposes Nazism will receive our great assistance. Anyone who sides with Hitler is our enemy. Therefore, we will provide the Soviet Union and its people with maximum assistance."

### Germany Claims to Have Broken Through the Stalin Line; Fierce Fighting Continues in Central and Northern Europe.

Reuters, London, 13th - After the German army launched a blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union along the 2,000-mile front from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, the German High Command soon issued a communiqué stating: (1) The German army launched fierce and valiant attacks at various important points and achieved great victories, having broken through the Stalin Line. (2) German and Romanian troops attacking from Moldavia have pushed back the Soviet army across the Dniester River on a broad front (this river is the boundary between Ukraine and Bessarabia). (3) German troops, together with Slovak and Hungarian troops, launched an attack from Galicia and are now pursuing the retreating Soviet army. (4) The German army is currently advancing towards Kyiv northeast of the Dniester River, and the strongly defended outpost along the Dnieper River north of the Pripet Marshes has been captured by the German army. Therefore, the main force of the German offensive has now advanced more than 250 miles east of Minsk. (5) Vitebsk (80 miles northeast of Smolensk, an important transportation center on the Minsk-Moscow highway) has been under German control since July 11. (6) East of Lake Peipus on the Soviet-Estonian border, several divisions of German armored vehicles are now advancing towards Leningrad. The German communiqué also stated that after the German air force destroyed the enemy's railway network, it has now made it impossible for the enemy to launch counter-offensives on a larger scale. The supply stations necessary for German armored vehicle operations have now moved closer to the Stalin Line. The German army launched this offensive after its rapid advance force penetrated 355 miles in 16 days.

Reuters, London, 13th - After a brief pause in the fighting on the Soviet-German front in recent days, fierce fighting has broken out again at three main locations. Although the German army claims victory, including a breakthrough of the Stalin Line, the communiqué issued by Moscow today stated that there was no significant military activity last night. The three main battlefields are as follows: (1) Near Pskov in the northern region, the German army claims to have made great progress in its offensive towards Leningrad. (2) A major battle is currently taking place near Vitebsk in the central region. (3) In the Novgorod-Volynsk region, Berlin claims that the German-Romanian joint forces have attacked Ukraine from the Moldavian region and pushed back the Soviet army to the other side of the Dniester River. The above-mentioned victories claimed by the German side have not been confirmed in today's Soviet communiqué, which stated that the Soviet army completely annihilated a German mechanized unit in the southwest region. The Soviet communiqué also stated that the Soviet air force continued to attack German airfields and military targets, and the oil wells in Ploiesti, Romania, were also heavily bombed by Soviet aircraft.

Reuters, London, 13th - Switzerland recently received a Nazi report commenting on the situation in which German tank units and infantry were driven out of Rogachev, southwest of Smolensk, at the confluence of the Dnieper and Trut rivers, stating that Rogachev is 25 miles west of Bobruisk. Last week, the German army launched the southern offensive of the pincer attack on Smolensk in that area. However, the German army failed to cross the Dnieper River because the Soviet army not only destroyed the bridges in time but also resisted fiercely. After the German army entered Rogachev, it was eventually forced to withdraw under heavy Soviet artillery fire.

### The War Situation is Serious

United Press, London, 13th - If the amazing progress claimed by the German official report yesterday is true, it will be the most devastating breakthrough war in world history, far surpassing the great achievements of Genghis Khan's cavalry breaking through the Great Wall of China in the past. This move is not only a breakthrough of a well-defended and stubbornly resisted front, but also will achieve countless breakthrough depths, and in all aspects threaten the large cities related to the survival of the Soviet Union. Leningrad and Kyiv are threatened more than Moscow. Although Moscow is the largest and most important city in the Soviet Union, it is still far from the German vanguard. However, if the German army advances to the east of Lake Peipus, they have obviously crushed the resistance in the Ostrov area, and the Soviet side once claimed that it was very successful in blocking the German army in that area. The German army's resolute advance will cut off the Soviet army in Estonia and pose a serious threat to the Soviet army, and will surround Kronstadt and the Soviet Baltic Fleet. The German army claims to be advancing towards Kyiv in Ukraine. If it is threatened in the southwest, the Soviet army will have to be forced to withdraw from the triangular position of Ternopil, Novgorod-Volynsk, and Mogilev, and the Soviet army also claimed to have curbed the German advance with counter-offensives in that area. After the German army attacked Vitebsk, it has obtained an important auxiliary railway junction, further threatening Smolensk, the largest hub transportation center in the western Soviet Union, from the north. After the German army forcibly crossed the Dnieper River and broke into 120 miles east of Minsk, another German column was only 50 miles west of Smolensk.

Haitong News Agency, 13th, German Führer Headquarters - The German military report this afternoon stated that all important strongholds of the Stalin Line have been breached by the German army and a special communiqué will be issued on this. The German, Hungarian, and Slovak joint forces are pursuing the Zhao army from Galicia. The German-Romanian joint forces attacking from Moldavia have approached Kyiv. A strong fortress north of the Pripet Marshes has been occupied by the German army. The center of our army's front is now 200 kilometers east of Minsk. The German armored vehicle unit east of Lake Peipus is attacking Leningrad. After the enemy's railway was destroyed by German aircraft, it is impossible for the enemy army to launch a large-scale counter-offensive.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 13th - After the German Command announced the occupation of Vitebsk last night, the most important stronghold of the so-called "Stalin Line" has now fallen into the hands of the German army. Vitebsk has a population of 100,000, half of whom are Jewish. It is located at the confluence of the Vitba and Daugava rivers, 450 kilometers from the German border, halfway between the German border and Moscow.

### Leningrad Suffers Fierce Air Raids; German Army Continues to Advance East on the Northern Route.

International News Agency, Stockholm, 13th - According to news arriving in Sweden today, Leningrad has been set ablaze by German air raids. It is reported that the industrial area of the city has been particularly badly damaged. It is also reported that Finnish heavy artillery is actively bombarding the Soviet fortress of Hanko, and the situation of the Red Army there is "critical". According to news from Helsinki, the Tallinn radio station is still in Soviet hands, so its broadcasting programs are all about the "heroism of Estonian guerrillas".

International News Agency, Stockholm, 13th - According to news arriving here today, the German army on the northern front has advanced to Narva, Estonia, on the Tallinn-Leningrad railway. Narva is 100 miles from Leningrad, and it is reported that fierce fighting is taking place in the marshland area 100 miles from Leningrad.

### Launching Our Newspaper's Readers' Scholarship Fund

In this turbulent and competitive society, there is a heartwarming phenomenon: many generous and enthusiastic people are helping the orphaned and impoverished, and relieving the poor. They roll up their sleeves to do public welfare, fearing to lag behind; they offer a helping hand to assist with donations, only worried about giving too little. This can be verified by our newspaper's past appeals for charitable organizations and the poor seeking assistance. To grant the requests for assistance with books, accommodation, and other expenses for the two disaster-stricken children, Ni and Bao, readers are willing to provide financial assistance and help them graduate, which is also based on Confucius's idea of "loving all people and being close to the benevolent." This action by the readers has silenced those who criticize society for being unsympathetic and human relations for being cold; and it can also move the followers of Yang Zhu, who only know themselves and not others, with the readers' compassion, and discover their loving hearts, which will be of even greater benefit.

In the past, studying involved the Four Books and Five Classics, reading books under dim lights, and studying independently, which was enough for learning. Nowadays, the subjects are complicated, and human affairs are complex. Without guidance, one cannot succeed. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve deep learning without attending school. However, today's school system is still a capitalist education. The expenses are very high. Education above the secondary level is only available to those above the middle class. Many ambitious young students with potential are unable to continue their studies due to financial difficulties, which is a great loss not only for the individual but also for the country, society, and the community. "To establish oneself, one must help others to establish themselves; to achieve oneself, one must help others to achieve themselves," is the intention of the benevolent. It is not regrettable if good material rots itself due to self-indulgence. However, it is the responsibility of the country, society, and the community to help those who are unable to display their talents, complete their studies, and fulfill their potential due to insufficient financial resources. How to reform the education system so that children from rich and poor families can have equal opportunities to study and develop their talents is still a matter for the future. Moreover, the evolution of the community is continuous, and after this great war, even the children who lived in luxury during peacetime have fallen into the ranks of disaster-stricken children and refugees. There is no lack of excellent and virtuous children who want to extricate themselves and seek self-improvement, which is even more difficult. This is not only the case for the disaster-stricken people; the current high cost of living, the high cost of food, books, and other expenses will also force children who were able to study in peacetime to be unable to afford these expenses and unable to continue their studies. Think about who has no children, who has no offspring. If you put yourself in their shoes, what would be their sadness and pain? Then you will see that those who have a compassionate heart and are happy to help others will be pleased to help children who cannot complete their studies to complete their studies, so that no talent is wasted.

I believe that the greatest purpose of a scholarship fund is to help those who have the potential but lack the financial means to achieve their academic goals. This is not limited to students in primary, secondary, or higher education. It is necessary to thoroughly investigate their academic performance, family financial situation, personal character, physical strength, and special talents, and then seek sympathy and assistance from people in the community to help them achieve their academic aspirations. This is only in terms of ordinary academics.

What society urgently needs today are specialized skills and talents with expertise, in other words, talents who understand science and can apply science. What China lacks is not only scientific talents trained in schools, but also scientific talents who study on their own in their spare time, have a strong interest in science, are rich in scientific research, and have scientific products. It is difficult to cultivate scientific talents, and it is not possible to exhaust the mysteries and uses of science by learning a few science books. Even without scientific common sense and norms, their actions, creations, and manufactures coincide with the spirit of science. This is countless in China's old-style industry and commerce. Therefore, it is believed that not only should we assist students in school, but we should also assist those outside of school who are diligent, specialized in science, and lack the expenses for experimental equipment, preparation, and consumption. This has not been considered by scholarships and loan programs in the past. If it is handled properly, the effectiveness will be far greater than funding ordinary academics. It embodies the promotion of science and encourages those with scientific foundations to continue to conduct scientific research after leaving school; and it provides the possibility for those who are interested in science but lack the resources to do further work to practice. This should also be the meaning of a scholarship fund.

The launch of our newspaper's readers' scholarship fund is based on the large number of students who are out of school and the deep trust that readers have in our newspaper. Every time we appeal for the public, we are always met with sympathy and generous support. Our newspaper dares not be more diligent, so as not to disappoint the enthusiasm of readers. Therefore, we are willing to serve readers and have a scholarship fund. We will do our best to ensure that every penny donated by readers is not wasted, and we will conduct investigations on the ground to benefit the scholars, promote academics, benefit the community, improve society, and think that social figures will be happy to share the responsibility.

### Guerrillas Active Behind German Lines, Destroying Transportation and Burning Villages

TASS, Moscow, 13th - The guerrillas in the rear of the invaders are very active. They are working hard to destroy the enemy's transportation lines, military vehicles, and fascist troops. A few days ago, seventy guerrillas attacked the enemy occupying the school. The enemy was panicked and suffered many casualties.

Havas, Bern, 13th

The "Journal de Genève" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that the German troops fighting in the Salla area of Finland are suffering from mosquitoes. All soldiers must wear a mask to protect their faces. In addition, in June and July every year, it dawns at 3:00 AM in Finland, the nights are short, and the Red Army lurks in the forests and launches attacks from time to time, which makes it difficult for the German army to cope. Moreover, before retreating, the Red Army often sends some daredevils to lurk in the forests, and when the German army pursues, they set fires in the forests. In addition, the transportation in the area is difficult and transportation has become a problem.

### Syrian Armistice Agreement: French Representative Signs First Word; Negotiations Held at Smith's Barracks; Five Weeks of War Concluded

Reuters, London, 13th: A Reuters war correspondent, reporting from near a British camp in Acre, stated that the Vichy delegation arrived in Acre after 11:00 AM yesterday. Its leader was General Vandirak, former commander of Damascus, accompanied by General Dentz's representatives, including several officers. The representatives departed from Beirut by car, passing through the war-torn coastal highway. The cars flew the French flag, and were escorted by six Australian cavalrymen. The Allied delegation, consisting of British Commander-in-Chief General Wilson, Australian Divisional Commander Lieutenant General Lavarack, Free French Commander Jadot, British Air Force Commander Blanc, and British officer Millen, greeted them. Vandirak stepped out of the car with a smile. The first to welcome him was Australian Divisional Commander Van, who shook hands with everyone, still smiling. They then entered the historically significant Smith's Barracks and convened a meeting in the officers' mess. The mess was guarded by soldiers. The barracks are named after General Smith, the British general who defeated Napoleon in the Near East campaign a century ago. Except for a few war correspondents and photographers, no one was allowed near the camp. This was the first armistice conference between Britain and France since the Battle of Waterloo. Discussions on the terms of the armistice were conducted in extreme secrecy.

In the entire world's anti-aggression struggle, our country is not only the earliest to start, but also the longest. Comparing the progress and current situation of battles everywhere, our country's situation today is also the best. The foundation of victory has long been laid. This is due to the efforts and struggles of the military and civilians across the country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, as well as the sympathy and assistance of friendly nations. Under this best situation, we should work harder to promote the arrival of victory. However, we should recognize that this decisive battle is the only opportunity for our national rejuvenation, and it is a crucial moment. After victory, we must continue to work hard in nation-building, building a splendid new Republic of China to benefit future generations. This is the responsibility that the people of the whole country should shoulder. We must abandon all short-sighted and selfish ideas, uphold the spirit of public service, stand in our own positions, and work hard to move forward. I firmly believe that not only can victory be achieved, but nation-building will also be completed in a short period of time. I hope my compatriots will step up their efforts. As for the friendly relations between China and France, they have been very long-standing. This difficult period is a good opportunity to build the foundation of friendship, and I will dedicate myself to this path.

### Current Situation of Chongqing Air Raid Shelters: People Use Them to Escape the Heat; Agency Staff Work Inside; Newspapers Relocate to Shelters for Publication

George Eyser, United Press Correspondent, Chongqing:

The world-famous air raid shelters are popular among the people during Japanese air raids, and during the extremely hot periods of the past few weeks, people have flocked to them even more. Chinese civilians have used these long tunnels or private air raid shelters as places to take afternoon naps, read books, drink tea, eat melon seeds, chat, and talk with friends. Employees of the Ministry of Communications also work in the air raid shelters to increase their efficiency. I visited an air raid shelter, and the people inside asked me if another air raid alarm had been issued. I told them that the Japanese troops might still be enjoying themselves in the air-conditioned bars of Hankou. The people in the shelter then continued to talk. Most of the people in the shelter were asleep, while cigarette vendors were selling to those who were not asleep, and business was booming. One mother was carefully reading the drawings of a new house to be built, while others were discussing rent increases. Reporters were invited to visit a radio communications group of a certain department, which is now working entirely in the shelter. Mechanical equipment and drivers are located at the end of the tunnel, while female secretaries and others work in places specially set up for them near the entrance to the tunnel. Officials claim that the work of these employees is more efficient because the shelter is cooler and their work is not disturbed by the arrival of Japanese bombers. In addition, the department has also installed an air defense telephone communication system to report the movements of Japanese aircraft day and night. All newspapers in Chongqing have relocated to air raid shelters, allowing them to protect valuable typefaces and printing equipment. Although the offices of the Ta Kung Pao and Sao Dang Bao were burned to the ground, the two newspapers are still printed and published in the shelters every day (13th dispatch).

### Hu Chuntai Fights Bravely; Fu Orders Commendation

Changsha: When Yueyang fell in the 27th year of the Republic, Hu Chuntai, a retired military officer, formed a guerrilla force that repeatedly defeated the Japanese. The Japanese feared him. In the spring of the 28th year, they captured and imprisoned his elder brother Chuntang, sister-in-law Xu, and more than ten relatives, coercing Hu Chuntang to surrender. Chuntang sent a letter to his brother, saying (Brother can die for national justice, brother cannot bend for the private feelings of flesh and blood, endure today, and repay in the afterlife), and burned his private house to show his determination. After receiving the letter, Hu Chuntang and his wife calmly died. Subsequently, Chuntai was appointed as the brigade commander of a certain unit in the Xiang-Gan-E Border Region, and achieved numerous merits. The Japanese even called him a tiger. The Yueyang County Party and government, in view of the loyalty of Hu's family, specially requested the Party and government branch of this war zone to grant generous compensation. The committee recently received a reply from Chairman Chiang, commending Hu Chuntai for his brave fighting, and Hu Chuntang and his wife for their martyrdom for their brother, which is worthy of emulation, and has been submitted to the Fuxu Committee for review and compensation (12th dispatch).

### U.S. President Calls Meeting to Discuss Amending the Draft Law; Marshall Pleads for Maintaining Maximum Military Strength to Be Readily Deployable Beyond the Western Hemisphere

(United Press International, Washington, 13th) It was learned here yesterday that Roosevelt convened a meeting of the House and Senate Military Affairs Committees to discuss a bill to retain existing troops for service beyond the regular conscription period and to remove geographical restrictions. Representative May, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, stated that Army Chief of Staff General Marshall had explained the necessity of this, and that he would submit the proposal next week. He also stated that the country needs "every soldier of military value" and that the War Department "will be authorized to deal with any possible eventuality."

(United Press International, Washington, 13th) Reliable sources stated yesterday that Chief of Staff General Marshall would advise congressional leaders that the tension in the world situation necessitates the United States maintaining maximum military strength, and that it should be capable of serving outside the Western Hemisphere at any time. However, it is said that he would tell the House of Representatives that the government has no current intention of sending an expeditionary force to Europe. General Marshall stated that if the U.S. military does not maintain a near-permanent foundation, it would greatly hinder the stationing of troops in Iceland and the Philippines. Meanwhile, the Senate Naval Affairs Committee is drafting a statement regarding the U.S. Navy's patrol activities in the Atlantic, based on testimony from Navy Secretary Knox, especially regarding any actions taken by U.S. ships against Nazi and other countries' vessels. It is understood that General Marshall expressed particular concern about the situation in the Pacific. He told congressional leaders that current restrictions would make the defense of the Philippines "difficult." This statement led congressional figures to believe that Japan has not abandoned its southward expansion plans.

(Havas Agency, Washington, 13th) The War Department had previously requested the House and Senate to amend the draft law, authorizing the government to retain soldiers who have completed their service period and to abolish the provision prohibiting the dispatch of regular and National Guard troops to areas outside the Western Hemisphere. The War Department, citing the active involvement of the Axis powers in South American countries and the Western Pacific, which could endanger U.S. security, has now requested the Senate and House to swiftly pass the amendments. Secretary of War Stimson and Chief of Staff General Marshall stated today that given the extremely delicate position of the Philippine Islands and the infiltration of German forces into certain South American countries, it should be regarded as a major danger to U.S. national defense. Therefore, the U.S. government must obtain the authority to send troops to areas outside the Western Hemisphere and to retain soldiers who have completed their service period.

(Havas Agency, Washington, 12th)

Government authorities are currently planning to submit a draft law amendment to the Senate and House of Representatives, advocating for the removal of the provision prohibiting the dispatch of U.S. troops to countries outside the Western Hemisphere and authorizing the government to order soldiers who have completed their service period to remain in the military. It is anticipated that this matter will provoke strong opposition from some senators. According to Senator Hill, a member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, this amendment will be submitted to the Senate for discussion on the 16th of this month. Although he has complied with the War Department's request to submit this amendment to the Senate, he personally does not endorse this measure, at least not in its current form. He voted in favor of the draft law in the past because he firmly believed that U.S. soldiers would not be dispatched to areas outside the Western Hemisphere and that the service period would not exceed one year. Political figures also stated that President Roosevelt went to his Hyde Park private residence today to spend the weekend, and it is expected that he will discuss this amendment when he meets with Senate and House leaders in the coming days.

England Closely Monitors Developments in Vietnam; Eastern Paper Says Japan Determined to Advance Southward

(United Press International, London, 13th) Authoritative sources here declared yesterday that Britain is closely monitoring developments in Vietnam. According to a Japanese newspaper, the pro-Japanese Annamese people there have been subjected to persecution by the authorities. Commenting on this report, authoritative sources said, "This story is a rehash of old news."

(Havas Agency, Tokyo, 13th) Newspapers here are still panicked by the encirclement of Japan's sphere of interest in the South Pacific by Britain and the United States, and they accuse Britain and the United States of encouraging other countries in the South Pacific to participate in the encirclement movement. According to the newspapers, there are two new crises. One is the so-called military alliance between China and Britain. This news was released yesterday by Domei News Agency, and it is being discussed in today's newspaper editorials. The second is the encirclement of Thailand by British forces. According to a Domei News Agency dispatch from the capital of Thailand, Britain is concentrating forces along the border between Burma and Malaya, preparing to take action, and is building 50 to 70 airfields in the two regions, with a total of 600 to 700 aircraft. Domei News Agency also issued a report criticizing the French authorities in Vietnam for failing to uphold the Franco-Japanese agreement. The Yomiuri Shimbun issued a warning, stating that if anti-Japanese movements in Vietnam are not stopped, Japan has the right to take all necessary measures to deal with them.

(United Press International, Tokyo, 13th) The Nichi Nichi Shimbun declared today that Japan will not hesitate to overcome all difficulties from foreign obstruction of Japan's peaceful southward advance. The newspaper also predicted that if the news of a military alliance between China and Britain is true, the United States will also join the alliance. However, even if the combined forces of China, Britain, and the United States encircle Japan, they cannot prevent the realization of Japan's peaceful southward program. The Asahi Shimbun stated that Britain is gradually encircling Japan by means of establishing a military alliance with the Chongqing government, with the aim of bringing Japan to ruin. The Yomiuri Shimbun advised the government to maintain a calm attitude towards the news of the Sino-British military alliance and not to be swayed by the schemes of third countries, and stated that Britain, being in an unfavorable position in the European war, wants to establish a defense line with China and the United States to protect its interests in the Far East.

Vietnamese Governor-General Signs Decree Establishing Consultative Council to Expand Public Sovereignty

(Reuters, Saigon, 13th) The Governor-General of Vietnam today signed a decree establishing a 25-member consultative council to broaden the base of government and give the public a greater voice in Vietnamese affairs. This new organization will act in an advisory capacity, with the Governor-General as chairman, who will convene it from time to time. The councilors will be recommended by the authorities in each province and appointed by the government, and elected by the district officers in conjunction with the tribal chiefs. There will be six members each from the Tonkin and Cochinchina regions, five each from Annam and Cambodia, and three from Laos. Those selected must have experience in public affairs and support Vietnam and France. Heads of government administrative departments may also participate in the work of the consultative council. Newspapers criticized that this new organization does not represent the restoration of a parliamentary system, and its discussions do not need to be made public. This approach is not entirely appropriate but meets the needs of the current period.

British Ambassador to the United States

(Reuters, Washington, 13th) British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, is scheduled to travel to California on the 15th with his wife to inspect aircraft manufacturing plants and British war relief organizations.

### British Naval and Air Force Cooperation Deals a Significant Blow to Germany; British Aircraft Brave Thunderstorms to Attack Northwest Germany; Naples, Italy Bombed Twice

(United Press International, London, 13th) British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander stated yesterday that Britain has recently dealt Germany a particularly significant blow at sea and in the air. Alexander listed three recent achievements. First, as a result of British naval and air force cooperation, the German military's supply lines in Libya have been severely threatened, which is very detrimental to German plans in that area. Second, the Coastal Command's bombers have sunk and damaged a large amount of enemy shipping. Third, our recent experience in destroying submarines has greatly encouraged the Naval Staff. He did not want to say where and when enemy ships were sunk, but only that in the past few weeks we have had special achievements.

(Reuters, London, 13th) It was announced here today that British aircraft heavily bombed northwest Germany last night. The air raid on Wilhelmshaven, an important North Sea port, was particularly intense. According to an Air Ministry communiqué, British aircraft braved severe thunderstorms last night to attack Wilhelmshaven and various targets in northwest Germany, dropping numerous high-explosive and incendiary bombs on industrial areas and Wilhelmshaven shipyards, causing large fires. Two British aircraft are missing. The communiqué also stated that enemy aircraft activity over Britain last night was very limited, mostly confined to coastal areas. Bombs were dropped in a few locations in South Wales and eastern England, but there are currently no reports of damage or casualties.

(Reuters, London, 13th) In the clear moonlight this morning, German long-range artillery positions on the French coast fired across the Dover Strait. Residents along the Kent coast were awakened from their sleep by the loud sound of the guns. The Germans fired several shells, one every minute. The shells all landed in the sea. Dover did not issue an air raid warning. It is believed that the German target was a convoy.

(United Press International, Cairo, 13th) It was stated here yesterday that on Thursday night, British aircraft launched a second consecutive night raid on Naples, Italy. Railway stations, warehouses, oil depots, and ships were bombed. It was also said that the fires caused by the bomb explosions could be seen eighty miles away.

(United Press International, Cairo, 13th) Officials here announced yesterday that as a result of British air force attacks on the port of Naples on Wednesday and Thursday, 47 people were killed, including 10 who have not been identified. 99 people were injured.

(United Press International, Cairo, 13th) The Egyptian Ministry of Interior announced that German aircraft attacked the Suez Canal this morning, dropping many bombs, killing six people and injuring fourteen, with considerable material damage.

(Reuters, Nicosia, 13th)

Officials announced that enemy aircraft attacked the port of Famagusta on the eastern end of Cyprus this morning. Bombs landed in the old city, causing slight damage to civilian houses. There are no reports of deaths or injuries.

(Reuters, Malta, 13th) Official reports stated that Malta was bombed on Friday night, with slight material damage and some civilian casualties. There was no damage to military equipment.

### U.S. Offers Assurance to Portugal; Resolves Not to Occupy Portuguese Islands; France Strengthens Land Defenses at Dakar and Other Locations; U.S. Senator Demands Withdrawal of British Troops from Iceland

(Reuters, New York, 13th) The Portuguese Minister to the United States, Bianchi, stated last night that the United States has assured Portugal that the United States will not send troops to the Azores and Cape Verde Islands. We have deep trust in the United States and know that their words match their actions. At the same time, we are taking all kinds of precautions, and any attempt to invade the Azores will be met with Portuguese resistance. We will defeat any invader, but we sincerely hope that this does not happen. When asked if the United States had assured Portugal that it would not occupy the Azores and Cape Verde Islands, the Portuguese Minister replied, "Of course."

(United Press International, Vichy, 13th) While Washington is reviving agitation for a "preventive" occupation of Dakar port, the French government has begun to reinforce its existing land defenses at Dakar, Casablanca, and Mers El Kébir. An official spokesman dismissed reports in London that 4,000 Germans have recently been engaged in installing coastal batteries with the aim of controlling the sea lanes to South America.

(Havas Agency, Washington, 12th)

Following British Prime Minister Churchill's recent speech indicating that British troops should remain stationed in Iceland, U.S. Democratic Senator Bonner, along with some members of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, today demanded the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Iceland to prevent German troops from attacking the island in the future. According to Senator Bonner, "At this point, the United States has already occupied Iceland, and British troops should withdraw immediately. According to the rules of war, as long as British troops do not withdraw, Germany has the right to attack Iceland." However, according to Democratic Senator Pepper, British troops should withdraw as soon as the strength of the U.S. military is sufficient to defend Iceland.

### A Journey to Western Hubei By: Ming Zhi

(Zigui Correspondence) The times have given me the opportunity to travel, fulfilling my long-held wish to travel from Chongqing to Western Hubei. On the morning of June 21st at 6 a.m., I boarded a ship, passed through countless mountains, and set sail eastward, singing the song "The Great River Flows East." How excited I was!

The ship chased the waves and followed the Yangtze River eastward in the dim morning light. The mountains on both sides were lush and verdant, with grotesque rocks, majestic and magnificent. The land on the mountains had been planted with sorghum, corn, and rice. The green paddy fields gently rippled with a layer of emerald waves as the summer breeze caressed them. The farmers nurtured them like nannies, watching them with wide eyes and fervent emotions, hoping they would grow quickly, be harvested soon, and stabilize the food supply.

The Daba Mountains followed the Yangtze River winding eastward. Countless treasures are buried beneath them, but unfortunately, only small-scale, traditional methods of mining are used, and the government does not seem to have paid attention to it. The most we saw were coal mines, where local people still used traditional methods of mining, with a price of 80 cents per 100 catties. If new machinery were used for mining, there would be a large daily production, and the price would certainly be cheaper, which would be a boost amid the coal shortage.

On the morning of the 22nd, the ship sped into the Qutang Gorge and, in the evening, crossed the Wushan Gorge, arriving in Badong County, Hubei Province. This small county, only a dozen li from north to south and a hundred li from east to west, is poor and barren, but in modern times, it has taken on the heavy responsibility of being the transportation hub of western Hubei. We boarded the wharf in the dusky evening.

The cost of living here is at least half that of Chongqing. There is a saying here, "Not three chi of flat land." Therefore, production is mainly corn and miscellaneous grains. But the price of rice is not expensive, either. It costs 3 yuan and 9 jiao per dou of rice (13 catties), which is more than four times lower than the price of rice in Chongqing.

Badong County was built by Kou Lai Gong. With the Yangtze River in front and the high mountains behind, there is only a street three li long. The residents here do not seem to pay attention to hygiene, and the county government does not seem to be responsible, resulting in gold everywhere. Tourists who arrive in Badong for the first time can only shake their heads, cover their noses, and curse "Stinky Badong" without end.

At dawn the next day, we set foot on the Shiba Highway. The Shiba Highway winds around the Yellow Earth Ridge in a "Z" shape. We stepped on the highway, spiraling upwards. Looking down, the Yangtze River wriggled eastward like a snake, and looking up at the top of the mountain, it was still in the clouds, high and unattainable.

Small parks are occasionally discovered beside the mountains, clean and quiet. Although they are only a chi in size, every blade of grass, every tree, every mountain, and every stone are arranged perfectly.

Leaving Badong, we took a small boat and sailed among the mountains and valleys. The waves were rapid and the wind was strong. In an instant, we arrived at Xiangxi, Zigui. This is the hometown of Wang Zhaojun, the concubine of Emperor Yuan of the Han Dynasty. A Tang poem says, "The mountains and valleys rush to Jingmen, Mingfei grew up in one village," referring to this place. Xiangxi flows north, reaching Xingshan. However, due to inconvenient transportation and the impact of education, some women still have bound feet. The beauty of "sinking fish and wild geese" is just a beautiful story.

After leaving the Qutang Gorge, the Yangtze River surges and flows through the mountains. After Xiangxi, it flows into the Baojian Gorge, where it is bundled up, and then into the Niugan and Matizhi Gorges, where it is bundled up again. Thus, the rapid currents and flying waves are blocked again. It reaches Yichang after leaving the Dengying Gorge, and then suddenly opens up, rushing down for thousands of miles. Therefore, today's Xiangxi, although it cannot make poets linger and no longer has romantic events, is still an important place for transportation. (June 28)

### British Shoot Down German Aircraft Near Capital of Iceland

### Rumors of Hong Kong Meeting Results; Decision to Maintain Shanghai's Black Market Exchange Rate; Japanese Funds at Risk of Being Frozen; Devaluation of the U.S. Dollar Imminent

Fox, an American member of the Stabilization Fund Committee, came to Shanghai on the 28th of last month with his assistant, Mr. Taylor, to investigate the Shanghai foreign exchange black market and its relationship with the mainland. After consulting and investigating with Chinese and foreign bankers and economic experts for more than two weeks, he completed his mission and took a boat to Hong Kong on the 10th of this month. Chen Guangfu, director of the Stabilization Fund's investigation in Kunming, as well as committee members Bei Songsun and Rogers, who were sent to Hong Kong to investigate, gathered together to hold an important meeting to discuss strategies for controlling the exchange market. According to highly reliable sources, the meeting has decided to maintain the effective measures of the Shanghai black market.

Rumors of Japanese Funds Being Frozen

According to authoritative sources, Japanese merchants sold a large amount of U.S. dollars last month, causing the exchange rates of the British and U.S. currencies to increase significantly. The reason for this move by the Japanese side is that U.S.-Japan relations are deteriorating, and conflict between the two countries is almost inevitable. Japan is deeply afraid that the United States will freeze Japanese funds. If Japan holds U.S. dollars, they will be useless, so they sold them off early.

U.S. Dollar Devaluation, Legal Tender Increase

According to well-informed financial sources, if the United States freezes Japanese funds, the economic relationship between the United States and the Axis powers will be completely severed. The United States has already frozen the funds of the Axis powers, such as Germany and Italy, as well as other countries, and Japan is the only one that has not yet taken this action. Once the economic relationship between the United States and the Axis powers is completely severed, the United States will devalue the U.S. dollar for the sake of developing its own economic interests and assisting democratic countries. At this time, the value of China's legal tender will undoubtedly increase even more. This move is not far from being realized.

Government Efforts to Balance Work

The role of the Stabilization Fund was originally to stabilize the foreign exchange rate after abandoning the gold standard. If the value of the domestic currency is low and foreign exchange is expensive, the fund will be used to sell foreign exchange and absorb domestic currency. Conversely, if the domestic currency is expensive and foreign exchange is cheap, the fund will purchase foreign exchange and release domestic currency as much as possible, ensuring that the two currencies do not lose their equilibrium level. The Chinese government signed a Stabilization Fund Agreement with Britain in March of the 28th year of the Republic, with the Central Bank of China and the Bank of England each contributing 5 million pounds, which was used to maintain Shanghai's foreign exchange black market. Unfortunately, the results of the implementation were not significant.

Future Market Must Be Stable

Since the United States announced a loan of 50 million U.S. dollars to China last November, followed by Britain's loan of 5 million pounds, and the Chinese government continued to allocate 20 million U.S. dollars, the total amount of funds reached 100 million U.S. dollars after the establishment of the Sino-British-American Stabilization Fund Committee in April this year. The strength is strong, which is not comparable to the situation when handling the stabilization work last time. Therefore, it is expected that the exchange market will inevitably tend to stabilize in the future, and the legal tender will have a consolidated position and credit, its value will increase day by day, and prices will inevitably fall as a result.

### English Electric Ticket Prices from Today; Minimum of One Dime; Monthly and Quarterly Tickets Increase in Price Next Month by an Average of 50%

The English-owned China General Omnibus Company and the English-owned Tramway Company have been approved by the Public Works Department to increase prices at the same time starting today. The two companies have issued separate announcements, and all new price lists have been posted in the trams and buses. It is said that the original minimum tram ticket price of six or seven cents will be at least one dime starting today. At the same time, the company will also increase the price of monthly and quarterly tickets starting on August 1. It is estimated that those that are common to the International Settlement will be 44 yuan for three months of consecutive use, 32 yuan per month for first-class adult monthly tickets, and 16 yuan per ticket for children under 16. Those that are common to the English and French Concessions will be 48 yuan per ticket for first-class adults and 24 yuan per ticket for children under 16 (an average increase of about 50% compared to the current system). However, those who have already purchased monthly or quarterly tickets for two consecutive months in July will still be allowed to use them until the end of August.

### The News of the Acquisition of the Shenxin Factories Has Caused Astonishment in Society; The Two Factories Are Currently Operated by British and American Merchants; Acquisition May Cause Diplomatic Disputes

Yesterday, it was rumored that the New Textile Factories No. 2 and No. 9 in this port would be taken over starting on August 1. All sectors that have financial transactions, stored yarn that has not been collected, or other disputes with the two factories are limited to settling them with the factories before July 25. Otherwise, unsettled matters will not be accepted. All sectors are very shocked by this.

The Two Factories Were Reorganized Long Ago

Of the Shenxin Textile Company's factories No. 1 to No. 9, No. 5, No. 6, and No. 7 in the Hankou area, No. 1 and No. 8 in Zhoujiaqiao, Huxi, and No. 3 in Wuxi were all destroyed by artillery fire or taken over due to the war. The only ones that can operate normally are No. 2 at 96 Yichang Road and No. 9 at 140 Macao Road. They were previously operated by Rong Zongjing, but now they have been reorganized. Factory No. 2 is operated by the American China Corporation, and Factory No. 9 is operated by the British-owned Jardine Matheson.

Transferred to Foreign Merchants after Reorganization

Yesterday, inquiries to the China New Textile Company revealed that Shenxin Factory No. 9 was reorganized into the British-owned Jardine Matheson before the August 13th Incident, and Factory No. 2 was transferred to the American-owned China Enterprises Corporation. But there has been no Chinese government stock in either the past or the present. They are all joint-stock company organizations. As for the rumors of the August 1st acquisition, they have only seen it reported in the newspapers and did not receive any prior notification. They do not want to express any opinions. This matter should be handled by the operating British and American merchants.

Acquisition Will Inevitably Cause Disputes

Shenxin Factories No. 2 and No. 9 continued to operate and weave yesterday. Factory No. 2 has 56,744 yarn spindles and 7,980 thread spindles. Factory No. 9 has 137,224 yarn spindles, 15,060 thread spindles, and 766 looms. If they are taken over, it is feared that diplomatic disputes will occur. The operating British and American merchants are determined. However, the American Enterprises Corporation and Jardine Matheson also do not want to express any opinions on this.

### Guangdong Ship Has Not Moved; Still Being Monitored; Machinery Has Not Been Unloaded Either

The British-owned Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship sailed from Shanghai South at noon on the 10th of this month. It was detained by the Japanese Navy at the Wusongkou for carrying machinery from the British-owned Arnhold & Co. It has been monitored at the Junpu Bureau wharf in Pudong for more than four days. The various situations were first recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the ship is still being monitored, and there is no sign of the machinery being unloaded. Negotiations between Britain and Japan are ongoing, and it is expected to be resolved within days. However, the company's losses due to the detention of the Guangdong ship are already considerable.

### Understanding the Reason for Helmick's Hasty Return to the United States: Attending Niece's Wedding

According to an official announcement from the U.S. Consulate General in China, Commissioner Helmick's return to the United States yesterday (the 12th) on the President Pierce was to attend his niece's wedding. Mr. Helmick originally intended to postpone his departure, but because the President Pierce delayed its departure, Mr. Helmick left early to try to board the ship.

### Today is France's Democratic Memorial Day; Simplified Ceremony; Foreign Guests Cease to Be Entertained; French Nationals Increase Feelings

Today is France's Democratic Memorial Day. Because the local French authorities are at a critical time, they will not celebrate extravagantly. In addition to the suspension of flags by various organizations and groups and a day off, no ceremonies will be held. This morning at 9:00 a.m., French Ambassador Cosme led the staff of various agencies to present flowers to the martyrs at the French Cemetery in Baxianqiao to commemorate their great achievements. At 9:30 a.m., the French Consulate General held a flag-raising ceremony. It is also heard that the French Consulate General and the French Police Department's usual practice of hosting guests from various countries will be temporarily suspended. The local French nationals seemed to have increased emotions on this National Day.

### U.S. Warship Transfers

According to sources within the U.S. Navy in this city, the U.S.S. Wake, a river gunboat of the U.S. Yangtze River Patrol Fleet currently stationed in the Huangpu River, has been ordered by Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet, and under the command of Captain A.E. Harris, to immediately leave Shanghai and sail to Hankou. The gunboat U.S.S. Oahu, currently stationed in Hankou, will return to Shanghai after the Wake arrives in Hankou as its replacement. It is understood that the U.S. Yangtze River Patrol Fleet currently has four gunboats. In addition to the two mentioned above, the flagship Luzon is currently stationed in Shanghai, where Rear Admiral Glassford is based. The other ship, the Tutuila, is blocked in Chongqing due to the blockade of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and cannot sail out. According to investigations by our reporter, in addition to the aforementioned U.S.S. Luzon, the foreign warships currently stationed in the Huangpu River include the French gunboats La Grandière and D'Iberville, the Italian gunboats Carlotto and Lepanto, the British gunboat Petrel, and nine other Japanese transport ships and miscellaneous vessels, totaling fifteen ships.

### Rumor of Telephone Workers' Strike Today - Insisting on Higher Pay - No Interruption Expected in Telephone Service in Various Districts

According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the telephone and gas departments of the Metropolitan Telephone Company employ over 1,700 female workers. Since the separation, the company has proposed conditions requesting the reinstatement of dismissed employees, the provision of rice subsidies, and a general wage increase starting in May. However, the company insists on the principle of layoffs, leading to a stalemate that has not been resolved satisfactorily.

Workers' Resolution

Approximately 700 workers in the company's electrical department have been negotiating with the company since the implementation of a work slowdown in the middle of last month. It is learned that the workers held meetings all day yesterday and resolved that approximately 1,000 workers in the telephone department will begin a work slowdown starting at 8:00 a.m. today to prompt the company to realize the situation. Representatives will also be sent to petition various sectors of society.

Normal Telephone Service

The company's headquarters and branches are divided into five departments: Detmold Road, Hai Ning Road, Huibuyou Road, Fujian Road, Baliqiao Road, Bixun Road, Lusheng Road, internal connection lines, business department, accounting department, engineering department, and administrative department. According to the workers' side, only Chinese workers will be participating in the slowdown today, while foreign workers will continue to work as usual. Therefore, no interruption is expected in telephone service in various districts.

### Accelerated Delivery of Letters Between Shanghai and Zhejiang

Light postal deliveries to various counties, cities, and towns in eastern Zhejiang, such as ordinary registered express mail and postcards, have been actively expedited by the postal administrations of Shanghai and Zhejiang. According to a senior postal official at the Shanghai Postal Administration, light mail sent from Shanghai to Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Keqiao, and other places in eastern Zhejiang now only takes one day per letter. Mail sent to Zhuji, Jinhua, Dongyang, Shengxian, Yiwu, and other places takes about ten days per letter. As for Ningbo, Cixi, Zhenhai, and other places, it takes about one week to arrive.

### Shanghai-Chongqing Route Through Guangzhou Bay - Restrictions to be Placed on Import and Export Goods

Since the interruption of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the route to Chongqing via Shaoguan has been disrupted. The routes for travelers to Chongqing, other than by plane, are limited to Rangoon and Guangzhou Bay. Previously, the Burma Road was open, but due to the complicated passport application procedures and the long detour, travel expenses were high. Therefore, this route is rarely used by ordinary travelers except for cargo transport. Those traveling from Shanghai to Chongqing can take a steamer to Hong Kong, then transfer to a steamer to Guangzhou Bay and then proceed inland. The sea route from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay and the accommodation situation in Guangzhou Bay are recorded below.

Steamer Passengers

The steamers from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay, namely the "Great Gem," "Great Harmony," and "Beneficial Achievement," can all arrive within eighteen hours. Upon arrival in Guangzhou Bay, all steamers berth in the waters of Xiying. Passengers can stay in Xiying or Chikan. Chikan is located at the border between Lianjiang and Suixi counties in Guangdong. Passengers who need to return to China quickly should stay in Chikan to save time and travel expenses. After disembarking, to go to Chikan, you can take a car provided by the hotel, along with your luggage. The car ride takes two thousand minutes to reach Chikan, and the car fare is 6.3 silver dollars. The largest hotels in Chikan include Nanhua and Dazhong, which are well-equipped. Each single room costs more than 6 silver dollars, which is about 20 national currency.

Cargo Transport Restrictions

The number of merchants trading between Hong Kong and Guangzhou Bay is increasing, but the situation of cargo transport is quite obscure. It is learned that the Commissioner-General of Guangzhou Bay has issued an announcement that the quantity of import and export goods will be restricted from August 1, 1941, to January 31, 1942. Each merchant applying for an import and export goods permit must pay 450 Hong Kong dollars per permit. It is said that many merchants are preparing to apply for more than ten or even dozens of permits, at least three or four. However, those who apply for permits before 6:00 p.m. on July 30 this year will still need to obtain the first issued permit. The value of this transport permit depends on the value of the goods and has no fixed standard.

Entry Permit to Hong Kong

For those traveling from Shanghai to Guangzhou Bay, Hong Kong is a must-pass place. The six-month entry permit issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Department in January this year will expire after July 15. If the permit holder does not need to travel elsewhere in the short term, there is no need to apply for a new permit and can continue to reside in Hong Kong. However, once the entry permit expires, it will be considered invalid, and the permit holder cannot enter or exit with it. As for the procedure for applying for a new permit, it is still handled according to the procedure at the time of the initial application, and an application form must first be filled out, a guarantee provided, and two photos submitted to the department for review and approval. It is inevitable that the qualifications possessed by the permit applicant six months ago have been lost.

### Shanghai Daycare Center

For the benefit of workers' children, the Shanghai YWCA has established the Shanghai Daycare Center in Tongren Hospital in Xuhui. It currently houses 30 children of workers aged one to four. The facilities, diet, nursing, and other aspects are very perfect and meticulous. The monthly expenses of about 2,000 yuan are all donated by enthusiastic people in social undertakings, and some children are also sponsored by enthusiastic people. This emerging social undertaking is indeed worthy of enthusiastic support from all walks of life and should be promoted. The photos below show the clean bedroom and the children's entertainment. Details were published in yesterday's newspaper. (Taken by Dahua)

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund - Enthusiastic Promotion from All Walks of Life - Over 800 Yuan Raised in One Day Yesterday - Eagerly Awaiting Continued Donations and Guidance from Readers

Since the news of the establishment of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund was published in yesterday's newspaper, in addition to expressing deep sympathy and donating generously, many people have also sent letters encouraging and expressing their willingness to assist in every way. Encouraged and urged by all sectors of society, this newspaper should be even more diligent and self-motivated, hoping not to disappoint the good intentions of all donors. However, at the beginning of the fundraising, in order to be serious about the awards, detailed investigations should be conducted on the students to be funded. This newspaper is mindful that this initiative is subject to the supervision and entrustment of people from all walks of life. If the funds are used properly and no social donations are wasted, this newspaper can avoid adding to its sins. It is still hoped that all sectors of society will continue to donate so that the fund can be successful. The following is a record of the scholarship funds received from all sectors yesterday.

Enthusiastic Donations from All Sectors

The reader scholarship fund received 500 yuan from Wang Shude, 30 yuan from Wang Jingen and Wang Qingdi, 20 yuan from Mr. Cai Wenhuan, 10 yuan from Mr. Ying Yongyu, 1 yuan from Mr. Zhou Jingao, 1.5 yuan from Mr. Li Qisheng, 1 yuan from Mr. Shi Zhifa, 1 yuan from Mr. Wang Defang, 1 yuan from Mr. Wang Juxian, 0.5 yuan from Mr. Hua Jinkang, and 200 yuan from Mr. Geng Geng. Mr. Zhang Shutong of this newspaper, who is famous in the art world for his calligraphy and painting, recently participated in the Xingxia Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition. Although only a dozen or so pieces were exhibited, they were sold out within three to five days, and pre-orders continued to arrive. Mr. Shutong is seventy years old and has devoted his life to education. Recently, he has been studying Buddhist scriptures. In view of the establishment of the reader scholarship fund, he specially allocated a portion of the proceeds from the sale of his calligraphy and paintings and donated 100 yuan to show his advocacy. His enthusiasm is admirable. Therefore, the actual amount received yesterday was 867 yuan, which, together with the previous 340 yuan, totaled 1,207 yuan.

Drafting Rules and Regulations for Thoroughness

This newspaper is currently drafting the organizational rules and regulations of the reader scholarship fund and the application review procedures to ensure thoroughness. It is expected that it will be announced in the near future for correction from society. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will generously donate to fulfill the great ambition of saving money for education and saving young people who have no means to study. In the future, the success of the reader scholarship fund will be a gift from people from all walks of life. It is hoped that all sectors will appreciate the sincere efforts of this newspaper to serve the public and actively promote it. In addition, yesterday, a letter was received from Mr. Ying Yongyu, hoping to expand the fund to include other loans. This newspaper is deeply grateful for Mr. Ying's concern. However, this newspaper believes that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step and will adhere to the principle of being down-to-earth to take one step and move forward one step. The expansion proposal should be considered in the future. In addition, a certain gentleman (who does not wish to announce his name) wrote to this newspaper that he is willing to do his best to help two students, Ni Zhaoqi and Bao Jia Zeng, to study. There are also those who ask us to send someone to collect the scholarship funds. We are deeply grateful and would like to thank the students applying for the scholarship on their behalf.

### Idle Chat About Amateur Opera Performers

— Ruoqi

Shanghai is a city where people from all over the country live, and you can hear dialects from all over the country. Therefore, local entertainment from all over the country can also be seen here. Peking opera, which was most popular during the late Qing Dynasty, is also particularly developed in Shanghai. The most famous performers from the north, such as Wang Guifen, Tan Xinpei, Yang Xiaolou, Long Yunfu, Qiu Guixian, Liu Hongsheng, and Wang Changlin, all had many audiences in Shanghai. From this, it is clear that there are indeed many people in Shanghai who understand opera. The general public has developed a strong interest in Peking opera, and in their spare time, they gather like-minded people, hire teachers to study, and after learning to a considerable extent, they also put on makeup and take the stage. This is called "amateur opera performer".

The so-called amateur opera performers existed long before the Republic of China, and there were also amateur opera clubs at that time. However, the amateur opera performers at that time could only sing operas with simple movements, such as "Cinnabar Mole", "Ascending to Heaven", and "Hanging the Golden Turtle". As far as I know, the earliest amateur opera club in Shanghai was the Yage Collection, followed by the Jiuji Opera Club. Both of these clubs were well-equipped and had small stages. In the mid-1920s, there was a Lüh Opera Club, which had a momentum of overtaking the others. These three are now nowhere to be found. Around the January 28th Incident, it could be said that there were the most amateur opera clubs, but recently they have gradually decreased again. Such as the Fanwangdu Club, Zhengyi Society, etc., also have Peking opera groups. Recently, there are very few independently established amateur opera clubs, but there are many Peking opera groups attached to them, such as customs, post offices, major banks, etc., all of which regard singing opera as a very legitimate form of entertainment.

From the Republic of China to the present, there have been no fewer than two hundred small amateur opera clubs that have appeared and disappeared like ephemeral flowers. Some are just borrowing half a room, and there is only one qin player to provide tuning for the voice. However, usually there is a teacher, a qin player, and a drummer. Of course, there are also many larger scales.

Since the rise of broadcast radio stations in Shanghai, amateur opera performers have had another opportunity to perform Qingchang. Some amateur opera performers can even only sing a few sentences learned from the radio, but they are still surprisingly popular, which is a small number. But there are those who are popular but may not be able to go on stage, which is very common. When it comes to persuading people to donate to disaster relief, the broadcasting of amateur opera performers certainly has great power. Recently, the broadcasting at the epidemic hospital for two days raised as much as eighty or ninety thousand yuan in donations, regardless of how the singing was.

In the amateur opera club, you can have the right to learn opera, tune your voice, and practice, which is of course. But there are also differences in learning, because there is less porridge than monks, and often some people hire so-called private teachers and qin players to study at home, but this is not something that the proletariat can enjoy.

Amateur opera clubs have regular rehearsals as a practical exercise. All expenses are paid by the performers to cover the expenses. The more elaborate the performance, the greater the cost. The Ningbo Fellow Association, the Pudong Fellow Association, and the Lake Society halls are the best places for amateur opera performers to "show their faces".

Shanghai produces the most amateur opera talents in Qingyi and Laosheng; Wusheng is second; Hualian, Laodan, and Xiaochou are the least; and those who learn the main roles are more, and those who learn the supporting roles are less. In terms of the scene, there are the most huqin and erhu; there are very few drummers; and there are almost none who play the suona and sanxian. )

Shanghai's amateur opera performers are best at singing, and there are also many who have good body movements, but it is most difficult to see good recitations. The biggest reason is that the teachers hired by the amateur opera clubs must be able to play Qingyi, Laosheng, teach civil opera, and teach martial opera. Therefore, it is difficult to have good results. (Large amateur opera clubs are different) As for singing, records are the only teacher. There are always fewer recitations than singing on records, and it is not very easy for southerners to learn recitations. Although it is also the Zhongzhou rhyme, the achievements of amateurs are only like that.

The purpose of the amateur opera club is probably to connect friendships and promote high-class entertainment. Except for a few famous amateur opera performers who have real skills, most people do not have artistic style, only the psychology of worshiping famous actors. Therefore, there was a time when there was a trend of praising actors, forming societies and parties, and praising the objects they praised to the skies, while verbally criticizing and attacking other actors. In addition to writing publicity, the praise actors also had to send flower baskets, plaques, and silk banners to the praised. When they took the stage, they shouted loudly in the audience, which was called "praising the stage." Later, this trend was also discovered in the amateur opera world itself. When a slightly famous amateur opera performer takes the stage, it is as lively as a popular actor.

Since most people admire famous actors, amateur opera performers also have so-called schools, so there are various strange names: such as "Mei Lanfang outside the city", "Cheng Yanqiu in the city"; "Ningbo Lao Tan", "Hangzhou Yu Shuyan", etc. The former refers to the place where they live, and the latter refers to their place of origin. This situation can also be said to be a special style of the amateur opera world.

In addition to Peking opera, only a few amateur opera performers in Shanghai learn Kunqu Opera. Occasionally, there are also those who learn to tell stories, sing open chapters, and Shaoxing's Dudu, but that range is even smaller.

Since the popularity of amateur opera clubs, the number of amateur opera performers has also increased, and the number of performances has also increased. The scenes, bands, costumes, and clothing boxes that are specially for amateur opera performers have also emerged. When we look at the front and back stages during amateur opera performances, we know that there are so many people who depend on amateur opera performers for their survival.

At each performance, each amateur opera performer has to pay money, but there are also those who do not spend money, because no one is willing to sing the opening song, but they are willing to sacrifice; or this amateur opera performer's art is superb, then their expenses will be paid by others. As for the amateur opera performers who spend money, the amount also varies, and the largest I know is more than 5,000 yuan for one opera. (Including tickets and all expenses) In the current situation, the minimum expense is about 30 yuan.

Actors make a living by performing, and amateur opera performers spend money to entertain. Although they both sing opera, their purposes are different. And it is also common for amateur opera performers to become famous and become professional actors, such as Qiu Xian who sings Hualian, Yan Jupeng who is a bearded Sheng, and Yu Zhenfei who is a Xiaosheng. This is called the amateur opera performer "going to sea".

### Abnormal Weather Affects Health

The weather has suddenly changed in recent days, the atmospheric pressure has dropped, there are occasional showers, and the nights are even cooler. According to hot weather agriculturalists, there will be thunder and heavy rain on the day of the Minor Heat in the lunar calendar. There is an old saying that "a thunder in Minor Heat reverses the yellow plum season", so the weather has been uncertain recently and has turned into the yellow plum season, and it is difficult to expect sunny weather for a while. However, there has been a lot of rain recently, which is quite beneficial to agriculture, because the hot season this year has been very long, and a large amount of rain is needed to replenish the fields. However, the weather is not normal, which has a great impact on the health of the citizens. If the daily life is not well adjusted and the diet is not careful, it is easy to breed diseases, and recently, diseases such as dysentery have emerged one after another.

Also, after the heavy rain in this city the day before yesterday, yesterday was still controlled by the plum rain climate, and the rain continued intermittently. According to the report of the Observatory, there are clouds or rain in the Yangtze River area, so this city has not been able to find a sunny image. The accumulated water on the roads has not been completely drained, so the average temperature in this city yesterday was still around 70 degrees. As for the new hurricane that originated in the Pacific Ocean, it is still slowly moving north-northwest, and the wind force is unknown.

### Car Robbed on Jing'an Temple Road Last Night - Another Car Refused Inspection - And Fled Without a Trace

At 12:00 last night, a black-plated car with license plate number 145 was suddenly stopped and robbed by several armed bandits on Jing'an Temple Road, and its whereabouts are unknown. After the police received the report, they immediately notified all police stations to pay attention to the car with this number. Later, when patrol officers were checking cars coming and going on Jing'an Temple Road Chengdu Road, a black-plated car with license plate number 8787 passed by. The patrol officers immediately ordered it to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, the driver of the car ignored it and drove away at full speed without a trace. The police authorities are strictly investigating cars with the license plate numbers 145 and 8787.

### Improvement of China's Wartime Financial and Economic Policies

— Xia Yande

This article is the original manuscript of a speech delivered by Mr. Xia Yande, Professor of Jinan University and concurrently Director of the Economics Department of Great China University, at the invitation of the Eight Immortals Bridge Book Club on July 3rd. We are deeply grateful to Mr. Xia for agreeing to have it published in this journal, and we believe that readers, whether or not they have already attended the lecture, will find this a chance to organize or supplement their knowledge. (Editor)

Foreword

I am very excited to be here today at the kind invitation of the chairman to meet with you all for discussion. All of you gentlemen are leaders in the business world and must have a great deal of practical experience. The opinions that I have developed through my academic pursuits can find an opportunity for correction here.

The chairman asked me to speak on some public finance issues, a topic that is very timely at the moment. Those of you who pay attention to national affairs will know that in recent months, the party and government authorities have held several meetings to discuss the improvement of national finance and economy. In early April, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Kuomintang passed the "Wartime Three-Year Construction Plan," which defined various political, economic, social, and cultural guidelines, with special emphasis on national defense economic construction under the principle of "three parts military affairs, seven parts economy." However, what was decided were several major policy guidelines, and the detailed specifics require further deliberation by experts. Therefore, at the end of June, the Ministry of Finance convened the Third National Finance Conference, bringing together financial officials and economists from various regions to further discuss the guidelines of the Eighth Central Committee Plenary Session. Many resolutions were passed, including policies on food and land in addition to financial policies. In particular, there were more concrete decisions in the financial area.

The decisions of these two conferences are of considerable importance. I believe that this is an important adjustment to China's wartime finance and economy after four years of war, and that the trends of postwar reconstruction can be roughly discerned from them, which is worthy of our close attention. Now, I might as well use this as the topic, use its important resolutions as the basis for discussion, and then incorporate some recent government measures to provide a general description and analysis, and offer some personal opinions for your guidance!

Financial Policy

China's peacetime finances were gradually getting on track. The annual expenditure was approximately 900 million to 1 billion yuan, with most of the income coming from taxes. Revenue and expenditure could barely be balanced, and the amount of borrowing was minimal. After the outbreak of the war, expenses soared, with annual expenditures totaling between 2 and 3 billion yuan, while income shrank sharply to around 160 million yuan, resulting in a ratio of expenditure to income of 18 to 1. The government's measures to increase revenue included: First, imposing new taxes, such as inheritance tax and excess profits tax; and reorganizing old taxes, such as expanding the scope of transit tax, extending the unified tax to border provinces, and doubling stamp duty. Second, issuing public bonds, including the National Salvation Bonds, National Defense Bonds, Gold Bonds, Grain Relief Bonds, Construction Bonds, and Military Bonds, a total of eight issues amounting to 4.7 billion yuan in national currency, and engaging in barter trade and credit with friendly countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, as well as currency system and railway loans. In addition, donations and contributions were also considerable. It can be seen that China's wartime finance has consistently followed the established policy of parallel tax revenue and public bonds.

The government's approach was initially dictated by the circumstances. Tax revenues from the coastal economic zones were almost completely lost, while inland tax revenues were limited and could not meet immediate needs. It was necessary to issue public bonds to meet urgent and large expenditures. Now that the war is entering its fifth year, the situation is very different from before: prices have soared everywhere, and the success of raising public bonds is not as good as before; if they cannot be absorbed after issuance, the result will be the same as inflation. On the other hand, the industrial base in the free areas is gradually solidifying, and businesses are making substantial profits, making tax sources increasingly abundant. At this time, I believe that raising funds can be mainly based on taxes, supplemented by loans from friendly countries, abandoning the orthodox fiscal policy of the past. The government authorities seem to have recognized this point as well, and the recent Eighth Central Committee Plenary Session and the Finance Conference resolved to enrich and improve the tax system and protect the legal tender, but did not mention raising debts.

(1) Promoting the direct tax system: China's tax system has always been dominated by indirect taxes, with direct taxes accounting for less than a fraction. In the budget for the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the three major central tax revenues from customs, unified tax, and tobacco and alcohol tax accounted for more than 92% of the total revenue, meaning that all direct taxes combined accounted for less than 5%. These indirect taxes are mostly consumption taxes, which can be passed on and are ultimately borne by ordinary consumers, violating the principle of fairness and being out of step with global trends. This system should have been reformed long ago. Public opinion has advocated it for a long time, and the government has also intended to do so, but it has been postponed. Now that major cities have fallen one after another, these tax revenues can no longer be obtained. The central government can only maintain its inherent tax revenue by thinking about direct taxes. The irrational tax system of many years has finally found an excellent opportunity for reform. The current national direct taxes include stamp duty, mining tax, transaction tax, income tax, inheritance tax, bank tax, and excess profits tax. Among them, income tax is a globally recognized good tax. It has been collected since October of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), and the results have been good. In the 28th year of the Republic (1939), it collected approximately 105 million yuan. In the future, as national income increases, the scope of taxation expands, and the collection methods are tightened, the tax amount is expected to continue to increase. The collection of inheritance tax can not only increase national revenue but also improve the social system. It was implemented on New Year's Day of the 29th year of the Republic (1940). The excess profits tax is levied on those who have made windfall profits during the war, which is especially fair. It has been collected since New Year's Day of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). In the first year, it collected approximately 1 million yuan. In the future, if there is a need, such as wartime property tax and capital levy, they can also be collected one after another.

The three-year plan also decided to "expand existing indirect taxes and select major daily necessities for travel monopoly system, so as to achieve a win-win for both national economy and people's livelihood." The implementation measures are: (1) Establishing a new unified wartime consumption tax to replace the existing transit tax-like levies; (2) Implementing a monopoly system for salt, tobacco, alcohol, tea, etc.; (3) Increasing the tax rate on consumables and changing it to ad valorem taxation. This should be seen as part of the entire tax increase plan. While the absolute number of indirect taxes increases, the relative tax revenue must focus on direct taxes. Otherwise, it will inevitably contradict the previous provisions. This reform, in addition to increasing wartime financial revenue and facilitating postwar financial reorganization, has an even more important significance: laying the foundation for a sound tax system in China in the future.

(2) Returning land tax to central management: In the era of the Beijing government, land tax was originally a national tax. However, land tax is a common property tax, and Chinese local tax revenue is too small, so it should logically belong to the local government. Therefore, since the establishment of the National Government, it has been changed to a local tax. Now it is decided that "the land tax of various provinces will be temporarily returned to the central government for unified planning and reorganization." Isn't this like taking the old road again? However, there is a reason for returning land tax to the central government at this time: in extraordinary times, the state needs funds urgently, and land profits are increasing day by day. If reorganization is implemented effectively, it will definitely increase tax revenue. In the past, the central government urged provinces to handle land reporting, which had considerable results; however, since the outbreak of the war, many have stopped planting, and even the tax rules are inconsistent, with various additional levies, causing an imbalance. In the future, temporarily returning it to central management can lead to unified planning and reorganization, completing land reporting, and implementing land value tax, so that tax revenue increases and distribution is rational. In the future, when land registration is clear and peace is restored, it is still possible to return it to the local government.

After this, land tax and surcharges will be changed to in-kind payment, that is, grain, not in currency. Moreover, in the Qing Dynasty, paying taxes was called "returning grain," that is, the so-called "in kind." This is an old-fashioned method from the era of in-kind economy. Today, we have entered the era of monetary economy, and taxes are calculated uniformly in legal tender. Only a few border provinces still collect land tax in kind. Now, turning back to collecting in kind, isn't this a regressive move? Moreover, collecting in-kind taxes has other drawbacks: grain prices vary in different places, making it difficult to ensure fair burden.

### Gold Market News and Knowledge

— Lecture by Mr. Zhang Yifan, Notes by Pan Zhiyun

Textbook for the "Southern Industry News" of the Southern College of Shanghai University

Market: The market was opened by the Gold Exchange before the war. After the war broke out, the exchange was ordered to close. After the National Army withdrew from Shanghai, silver shops initially quoted prices based on the conversion of foreign gold prices. Later, the four major firms rented an office at 29 Renji Road as a place for price discussion. The number of participants increased, and the volume of transactions increased day by day, eventually forming an illegal open market. As of today, it has become one of the major speculative markets in the city.

Goods: The trading goods before the war were called "Biao Jin" (standard gold), with a purity of 978. They were assessed by the Public Appraisal Bureau. They were more than two inches long and five fen thick, in the shape of bricks, with the shop number and seal. Sales were made in units of one ping (70 taels). The black market during the war traded "Sha Chi" (smelted red gold), which was produced by silver smelters. Nominally, it was pure gold, so it was also called "Zu Chi" (full purity). In reality, the purity was not over 998, and some were only around 980. Initially, transactions were calculated based on 998 purity and were limited to spot goods. Later, speculation increased, and spot transactions also included buying long and selling short. After the squeeze in the winter of last year, futures trading was openly carried out, with spot trading as the axis. It was stipulated that the standard purity was 993. Spot Sha Chi (also called "Ben Pai Jin" or original brand gold) is five inches long and two fen thick, in the shape of a bar, hence the name "Tiao Zi" (bar). Whether it is futures or spot, the trading unit starts from one bar. However, the current spot price must be two to three hundred yuan higher than the futures price.

Gold Price: The gold prices reported before the war can be divided into two categories: one is the legal price, and the other is the market price. The former is quoted by the Central Bank, divided into the standard gold price and the pure gold purchase price, both of which are converted from the London pure gold price at the legal exchange rate. The standard gold price is 1366.2 yuan, and the pure gold purchase price is 1371.8 yuan, which remains unchanged to this day.

The formula for the standard gold price quoted by the Central Bank:

The formula for the pure gold purchase price quoted by the Central Bank is the same as above. However, the purity of pure gold is 999, and the exchange rate is calculated based on the selling price of one shilling and three and three-quarter pence (i.e., 14.75 pence). Therefore, it is about five yuan more expensive. These two legal prices exist in name only, and there is no market for them in reality. The gold price that truly affects the general price level is the market price of Sha Chi.

The market price of gold currently includes three types: Sha Chi futures price, Sha Chi spot price (also called Ben Pai Jin price), and silver shop jewelry gold price, with the Sha Chi futures price as the center, and the rest fluctuate with it. The first two are calculated per bar of ten market taels, and jewelry gold is calculated per market tael. And each has buying and selling prices. The difference between the buying and selling prices of the first two is about five yuan per bar. The difference between the redemption and receipt of jewelry gold is about forty yuan per tael.

The market price of Sha Chi theoretically depends on the US exchange rate and the New York gold price. The New York pure gold price is fixed at US$35 per ounce, so it actually only depends on the Shanghai-US black market exchange rate. It is often formed by speculators stirring up the market, and even reflects its impact on foreign exchange, causing the exchange rate to fluctuate with it. However, in general, the gold price is dominated by the exchange rate more often. However, the so-called exchange rate is fundamentally a product of speculation. Therefore, neither does the gold price dominate the exchange rate, nor does the exchange rate dominate the gold price. In a word, it is only the long and short forces of speculation that dominate the exchange rate and the gold price, and they are mutually cause and effect.

As for the formula for its theoretical parity with the New York pure gold price, there is no fixed conclusion at first because the purity of Sha Chi itself is inconsistent. I have calculated its fixed number based on the foot color to be 35.1649. If multiplied by the Shanghai-US indicative price of the number of legal tender coins per yuan of leaf gold, the US dollar price of Sha Chi on that day can be obtained after deducting a 2.5/1000 handling fee. The purity of Sha Chi in this city has been set at 993 since the so-called futures appeared, so its fixed number should be 34.6645548. The formula is

Dividing this fixed number by the Shanghai-US exchange rate of 100 legal tender coins, or multiplying it by the Shanghai-US exchange price of one US dollar, will give the theoretical parity price of Sha Chi at that time.

However, the fixed number currently used in the market is 34.825, and it is unknown how it is calculated. Because it is larger than what I calculated, the theoretical parity price obtained is also more substantial than what I calculated.

Fallacy: The current general price level almost depends on the gold price. The reliance argument is nothing more than one and two, two and one, of the total price and the indicative price. Therefore, changes in the total price and the exchange price are regarded as the progress and regression of the purchasing power of legal tender. This theory is actually falsely true, because the purchasing power of legal tender is theoretically nothing more than a product of the legal system, and has nothing to do with gold exchange at all. It only presents an abnormal connection due to the impact of the balance of payments. Therefore, stabilizing prices seems to start with stabilizing gold prices and indicative prices. However, the current price level is fundamentally a product of speculation. If the relationship between the gold price and the exchange price is relatively deep, but when the exchange price continues to collapse and the futures Sha Chi falls with it, the high premium of the spot Sha Chi price actually expands on a regular basis. Because the spot Sha Chi price is not small, it often holds back the falling futures gold price, thereby also restraining the lengthening of the exchange price. According to wartime laws, not only is the Sha Chi market not allowed to exist, but the private transaction of gold coins is also generally prohibited. At this time, Shanghai Lici has no way to extinguish the world, and now we can only temporarily discuss it separately.

### My Opinion on the Method of Exchange of Notes in the Money Industry (Continued)

— Jack

According to the four suggestions made by each village, half advocate improvement and half advocate reform, and those who do not approve of the past method of consolidating public lists seek to improve it, and their views are generally consistent. Therefore, the main purpose of the opinions in items (2) and (4) is not that the public list system still exists, but that the regulations on exchange time are extended. The crux of the current problem is that some member villages believe that the procedures are cumbersome, and that the numbers on the note exchange public list report form cannot be dyed. The so-called cumbersome procedures are that the money houses have always been familiar with the note collection and delivery, the receipt and payment of public lists, and the consolidation of differences based on public lists. The filling in of the "Note Exchange Public List Report Form" is a new task. Among the money industry exchange members, there are those who are accustomed to the convenience of writing commercial codes, and they feel that they are not proficient in the new method of recording, so they feel that the procedures are more cumbersome, or there is a feeling of unhappiness due to errors in numbers and difficulty in aligning.

Therefore, the current reform of the method of exchanging notes in the money industry does not lie in whether the public list system is restored, and the simplicity of the procedures does not lie in the existence or abolition of the "Note Exchange Public List Report Form". The key is how to reform it further to make it the same as the exchange method of the note exchange. Then the shortcomings that are currently considered will definitely be swept away. The exchange method of the note exchange is not only the use of an "Exchange Difference Calculation Table". The bank submitting the notes must fill out and send a "Note Submission Notice", stating the type, number and amount of the notes, and the other bank must also sign a "Yangzhou Note Receipt" to the bank submitting the notes after checking that the notes to be paid are correct. Therefore, in my humble opinion, the method of money industry exchange is not as good as adopting this method, abolishing the public list, and having the money house submitting the notes fill out and send a "Note Submission Notice", and the other money house to give a "Note Submission Receipt". What Yizhuang receives is what Yizhuang pays. When Yizhuang receives the "Note Submission Notice" from Yizhuang, it must be verified to be correct before signing the "Note Submission Receipt". At this time, Yizhuang can immediately fill in the payment of the Guobi Jianmen Jia Zhuang in the "Note Exchange Public List Report Form" based on the amount of Jia Zhuang's "Note Submission Notice". If Yizhuang receives other villagers' "Note Submission Notice", handle it in the same way. (As for the receipt of the Guobi counter in the "Note Exchange Public List Report Form", it should be filled in based on the "Note Submission Notice" made before the exchange, and checked against the "Note Submission Receipt" received during the exchange). In this way, there is no need to print public lists and fill in forms during the exchange. Only the work of filling in receipts and reports and calculating the difference will not lead to errors in writing or seeing.

This reform does not require difficult work for the exchange members of the money house. Since the implementation of the daily report form on June 1, each exchange member has more experience, and today's method can further increase their experience. In short, the opinion on the reform of the exchange method is nothing more than the above, as to how to stipulate the time and number of exchanges of notes, it is up to the members of the board to discuss.

### The Economic Standpoint of Summer Food Yaming

At the moment, the sale of anything is very expensive. However, housewives' design of meals is worth dealing with in a smart way, because the expenditure on diet is not comparable to clothing. If you can save a few cents every day, it is very considerable to calculate it in a month, and the following points are more worthy of attention. Expensive food is not necessarily the best food. At present, due to transportation and other reasons, the cost of many foods is very high, but in terms of nutritional value, it may not have full effect, so when buying, you cannot estimate the value of food based on the selling price. Disposal of leftover food. Sometimes there is inevitably leftover food. If the food is still in a clean state, it can be used and combined with other foods to cook another dish, so that the expenditure of money can be reduced invisibly.

Prices are worth comparing. The selling prices of vegetables and other foods are not uniform. If the freshness and beauty are uniform, the prices are worth comparing.

Cleanliness should be the prerequisite when purchasing. All foods should pay attention to its cleanliness. Many stores have considerable measures for this, preventing flies, insects, and unnecessary human contact. To buy food, you can go to this store. If it is meat food, it is best for the housewife to choose it herself, which is much more reliable.

### Summer Children's Dietary Hygiene Jing

1. When children eat, they should be taught to eat slowly. 2. When eating, they should eat less water, but after meals, they should drink more water.

3. Teach him to eat what he is given, and do not develop the habit of choosing food himself.

4. Do not give him fried food, tea, and coffee.

5. Do not give him snacks after meals. 6. He can be taught to brush his teeth after meals. 7. If you give him a drink, you should choose a sterilized and reliable one.

8. Give him cod liver oil often. The beautiful habit of eating is worth developing. If children want to choose food on their own initiative, it is very important for their health. Never let children be attracted by other things and not eat at ease. Sometimes, in order to do what they love to do, they try their best to gobble up things, which is very harmful to their digestive organs.

### Talking About Cold Drinks Bu Yun

Summer has arrived, and the heat wave has invaded the world. Heat is what everyone has a headache for. A friend said: Fortunately, there are cold drinks in summer, and I feel that there is still fun; otherwise, I would rather commit suicide! In this way, cold drinks are welcomed by people in summer, as you can imagine.

Ice cream occupies the most important position in cold drinks; but many of them are unhygienic when they are made and sold in the market by themselves. Not to mention the popsicles that cost a few cents each.

The most expensive ice brick costs two yuan and four corners. The cheapest popsicle only costs five cents. A pot of tea in a teahouse costs thirty cents; a bowl of herbal tea by the roadside costs two cents. The standard of living differs by more than ten times!

The taste of iced milk is hundreds of times better than hot milk, and the effect of cooling off is also better than ice cream.

China's jelly and mung bean soup are both hygienic and can cool off, which is indeed the best of cold drinks! If you can make it yourself, it is more delicious than other cold drinks.

Iced watermelon is also a good product for relieving the heat; unfortunately, the price of watermelon is horribly expensive this year, and our poor scholars are not blessed to enjoy it.

Many companies and businesses use sand-filtered water as a beverage. But when the weather is hot, cups of sand-filtered water go down the throat, breaking the stomach, but still cannot quench thirst, and the mouth is tasteless! Someone invented to use sand-filtered water to brew grass seeds and dew to drink, which has a unique flavor.

When running into an ice drinking room, I want to eat ice cream. After eating well and walking out of the ice drinking room, I still want to eat it. People who like cold drinks have this kind of psychological phenomenon.

### Summer Food Preservation

Cooking: Once food is boiled, all the attached bacteria are completely killed, especially meat, because after boiling, the protein coagulates and is not suitable for bacterial nutrition.

Refrigeration: Bacteria do not easily multiply at low temperatures. Therefore, putting food in a cold place and storing it properly can keep it from spoiling for a long time and maintain its original taste.

Pickling: Salt has bactericidal properties, and if food is placed in salt juice, or salt is sprinkled around, it can avoid spoilage.

Drying: The reproduction of bacteria depends on moisture, so if food is dried in the sun or smoked with fire, so that the moisture is completely lost, bacteria will not easily multiply.

Oil immersion: Food immersed in oil can also prevent spoilage, because food immersed in oil can isolate the air and prevent its oxidation.

Sugar pickling: Sugar also has a bactericidal function, so sprinkling sugar granules around the food, or immersing the food in sugar liquid, can also prevent spoilage. (Yun)

### Proposing the Western Way of Eating Chinese Food by Yongren

I often have a feeling when dining with my family, which is that the way Chinese dishes are eaten is extremely unsanitary. Imagine a table of seven or eight people, using seven or eight pairs of chopsticks and seven or eight spoons, taking turns stirring in each bowl of dishes. The saliva of seven or eight people will inevitably mix with each other, unknowingly eating each other's saliva. If all seven or eight people are family members, then although it is unsanitary, there will be no other consequences. As for public places or celebratory banquets, imagine everyone stirring in the dishes dozens of times each. How serious would the unsanitary situation be! Especially in summer, the spread of disease is even more unavoidable. However, the general public does not pay attention to the great harm of this traditional eating method. Thinking carefully about it is frightening!

I recall that there is no such drawback in the Western way of eating. Each person has their own knife, fork, plate, and spoon, so even if there is disease, there is no worry of transmission. However, there are also difficulties in applying the Western way of eating. First, Chinese people are used to using chopsticks, and are not able to use knives and forks freely. Secondly, individual servings require more utensils, and the amount of food may be more wasteful due to too many separate bowls. These two difficulties are easily avoided. First, everyone can still use chopsticks, bowls, and spoons. Second, having more utensils is unavoidable. The amount of food must be saved a little, or the amount can be determined according to individual preferences. If you eat in this way, there is no change to Chinese eating habits, and the danger of unknowingly harming hygiene and spreading disease every day can be completely avoided.

In fact, the term "Western way of eating Chinese food" has been mentioned before. Some places have also implemented it. What I think should be especially promoted here are all public places, restaurants, tea rooms, and large factories and stores. This small improvement may also help public health! As for individual families, if there are too many people, it is still best to use the Western way of eating. It takes a little more effort and more utensils, which does not cost much, and indirectly benefits the whole family, which is not insignificant.

Some people think that individual servings are inconvenient because the amount of food is different for each person. However, according to my experience, individual servings are more economical than shared eating. After individual servings, the quality of the vegetables is very even, and the amount of vegetables can be greatly reduced without competition (referring to competing to pick vegetables). Taking children as an example, several people eating together will inevitably lead to empty bowls and calls for more, but after individual servings, everyone may still have leftover soup. This alone shows the benefits of the Western way of eating. What's more, in this year of expensive dishes, the implementation of the Western way of eating Chinese food may also be a restraint on the "Vegetable General!"

### A Freezer Older Than 10,000 Years

Ten thousand years ago, many mammoths retreated from Europe and Asia to the ice caves of northwestern Siberia, and were frozen to death as a result. Now, they are often discovered, not only with their bodies and hair undamaged, but even the food in their stomachs is not decayed at all. This freezer, which is over 10,000 years old, can be said to be the oldest refrigerator in the world. (Hundred)

You only need to buy half a winter melon, dig out the seeds and pith, put in diced chicken, diced duck, diced ham, dried scallops, fresh lotus seeds, dried mushrooms, Jinhua ham tips, salt flowers, etc., seal the top with mulberry paper, and steam it in a pot over water. If you use a fresh lotus leaf to seal the opening, then it will have a clear fragrance when eaten, which is better than mulberry paper. This winter melon soup is aristocratic. Although it is delicious, it is also quite expensive. As for being more economical, you can just use chicken giblets, diced meat, dried scallops, shiitake mushrooms, edamame, etc., and the taste will not be bad either.

### A Record of Applying for a Private Tutor Position

— Fenxun

Since the summer vacation began, I have been paying attention to the "Hiring" ads in the newspaper almost every day. Today, in the corner of the newspaper, I saw such a small advertisement:

"Now hiring a private tutor to teach two elementary school students and one middle school student.

Three hours a day, monthly salary of thirty yuan. Those who wish to take this position, please come to ×× Road ×× Lane × number for an interview."

I thought, I can definitely be competent for this position. Although thirty yuan is a small amount, it can always supplement my income. It was drizzling, and because I wanted to get there first, I left the house at half past eight.

This is a delicate living room, and the furnishings are very exquisite. A middle-aged woman in her thirties was sitting on the sofa, staring thoughtfully at the calligraphy and paintings on the wall. The maid told me:

"Please sit here for a while, our master will be down soon." I sat down on a chair. The woman looked at me with surprise, but immediately withdrew her gaze and focused on the calligraphy and paintings on the wall. I thought:

"She must be here to apply too! She's even earlier than me."

In less than ten minutes, two more people came in, one was a middle-aged man, and the other was a young man.

The sound of leather shoes "De Tuk De Tuk" came, and the master was coming downstairs. My heart was pounding.

This was a young gentleman, in his thirties, wearing a suit, neatly dressed, and his leather shoes were shiny. The first thing he said when he came in was:

"I'm very sorry to have kept you all waiting."

So he began to ask one by one:

"What is your name?"

"What school did you graduate from?"

"Where are you currently employed?"

As a result of the questions, according to what I heard, the woman had graduated from middle school eight years ago and was now teaching at ×× Elementary School; the middle-aged man had graduated from × University and was now teaching at ×× Middle School; the other young man was a third-year student at ××× University; as for me, my qualifications were the worst, having only studied at a university for one year. However, I thought that these four people could be qualified for this position; I was worried for the master: how would he deal with these four strangers?

The master considered for a moment and then spoke. I knew that I would definitely fail, but I didn't want to run away before the master announced that I had been eliminated.

The master first said to the woman:

"I'm really sorry, but because there is a middle school student here, otherwise, I would definitely give this position to you."

The woman's face turned red. She was embarrassed to argue with the master that she could teach middle school students, so she gave up the position and left quickly. The master sent her out the door, apologizing all the way.

Because I knew I would definitely fail, my heart didn't pound as much as when I first arrived.

After the master sent the woman away, he turned to me and the young ××× student and said:

"I'm very sorry, we need a teacher with experience, and you two are still in school."

I really wanted to say that I had worked as a private tutor for two months last summer vacation, but I didn't have the courage.

Undoubtedly, the × University graduate was victorious.

The master sent us two out the door, and at the door, we met another woman. This woman asked the master:

"Are you hiring a private tutor here?"

The master replied lightly:

"I'm sorry, we've already hired one." Can't this ladder be knocked down a bit? Green as Pine and Crane

### Flower Language

— Pine and Crane

Master: I often read about "carjacking cases" in the newspaper these days, and I feel very dangerous riding in a car! What can I do to avoid this disaster?

Driver: These days, please "walk as a good plan" and let me "rest for a few days."

10 The Heart of a Compassionate Father

Unexpectedly, when this sentence was spoken, it was like throwing a bomb on his own face.

"Papa!" Caught off guard, Mei Bao struggled to break free from his arm, and slipped to the ground like a loach.

When he lowered his head to look, a thick layer of frost had unexpectedly piled up on the face of this twelve-year-old girl; a surge of emotion that was both painful and indignant shot out from her two eyes, and penetrated straight into Qiuhaitang's heart, startling him so much that he almost dropped his umbrella.

Half of Mei Bao's body was still under the shelter of the umbrella, and half was already soaked in the rain.

"What's wrong? Child, your shoes will be unwearable tomorrow!" Qiuhaitang still wanted to bend down and pick her up.

"Papa, wait a bit!" Mei Bao was as stubborn as a little ox. "Xiao Gouzi isn't here, you have to listen to me! It won't be too late to go back after we've finished talking!"

No matter how clever Qiuhaitang was, he couldn't figure out what his daughter wanted to negotiate with him. Of course, the biggest reason was because he thought she was too young, or to put it more accurately, he was too negligent of her extraordinary talent, otherwise he should have been prepared for such a day long ago.

"..." Now he could only stare at her blankly.

"Papa, don't think I'm still a child, I actually understand everything, I remember everything." She raised her small face and said without any discouragement, even more experienced than when she performed on stage at the art fair she opened at school last year. (157)

### On Children's Reading Materials

— Xu Daming

The Shanghai Children's Library has finally opened. And the preparation time for this event cannot be considered short. I remember that on "Children's Day," they once held a "Children's Book Exhibition," inviting various bookstores to participate in the display, and inviting "book collectors" to join the "exhibition."

But here, I believe that children's reading materials still need greater progress in quality and quantity. Today, writers of children's reading materials are indeed very scarce, and the original writers must also move forward with the times.

Our requirements are not too high—it would be best to be progressive and correct, but at least they should write with a correct viewpoint that does not contain toxins.

Indeed, the field of children's reading materials is by no means limited to just "fairy tales." Other things like "children's plays," "nursery rhymes," and even "comic strips," are all areas for children's reading material writers. As for how to increase the number of writers, we believe that primary school teachers should be the most numerous, because they are closest to children and have a relatively deep understanding of children's likes and personalities. We believe that the selection of this talent cannot be ignored.

As for the issue of "comic strips," it is only a change in content; the format is not a problem. We hope that general social organizations can put more effort into this. If they can improve these "comic strips" that attract a large number of children, that would be the greatest merit!

Finally, it must be pointed out that children's libraries should be updated daily and become a real treasure trove of spiritual food for children.

Please, gentlemen, save the children! The lineup of children's reading materials must be broader and more solid today. We must not neglect children!

Landlord: "What have you been 'doing' this month?" The utility bills are more than double what they were last month. Please save some! Otherwise, we'll have to "shut the whole place down!"

Tenant: "Then please install 'fluorescent lights'; it can save 'half the electricity bill'."

### Small Statistics

Five households agreed to the rent with cooking and other conditions.
