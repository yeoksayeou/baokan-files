### The Pacific Crisis Intensifies: Thai-Vietnamese Negotiations Approach Final Stage. Japanese Mediation Proposals Contain a "Veiled Ultimatum." Deadline Passed Last Midnight Without French Response

Tokyo - According to responsible sources, the French government may not respond to Japan's proposed mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute tonight. As of 6:00 PM today, the French side has not sent any official note to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, nor has there been any indication of a future agreement. Overseas reports that Japan issued an ultimatum expiring at midnight today are not true. Reliable sources indicate that the Japanese government hopes to receive a concrete response from the French side tomorrow. (Reuters, 28th)

London - According to sources here, the timing of Japan's withdrawal of its residents from Vietnam and the serious crisis in the Tokyo mediation conference coincide, indicating that Japan is preparing to gain freedom of action. Japan's intervention clearly demands a substantial price. It is now rumored that a major obstacle has arisen, and the public is paying close attention to whether the Vietnam issue will lead to a Pacific war. (28th)

London - The attitude of the Vichy government towards Japan's latest proposal for resolving the Thai-Vietnamese dispute remains unclear. This afternoon, a cabinet meeting was held under the chairmanship of Marshal Pétain to discuss the situation. Deputy Premier and Navy Minister Darlan has reportedly postponed his trip to Paris to attend the meeting. The outcome is currently unknown. Last night, a government spokesman said that the Vichy government has set the maximum limit of concessions. (Reuters, 28th)

Tokyo - According to responsible sources, the peace proposal put forward by Japan in its capacity as mediator in the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute is considered by Japan to be the final condition for mediation. The only options for both Thailand and Vietnam are to accept this plan or reject it completely. "Nichinichi Shimbun" summarized dispatches from Vichy and Vietnam, believing that the French authorities are inclined to reject the Japanese proposal, and that "as a result of a threatening attitude from a third party, it has requested assistance from elements within Vietnam who support de Gaulle." Although the Vietnamese authorities agree to some points of the Japanese proposal, they generally hold very different views. At the same time, only eighteen hours remain until the deadline for Thailand and Vietnam to accept the Japanese mediation proposal. Tokyo newspapers prominently report that the French side has not yet formally notified Japan of its attitude, but it is heard that Thailand has notified Japan that it can accept the proposal put forward by Japan on February 24th. The French side remains silent on the Japanese proposal. Well-informed observers unanimously believe that the Japanese proposal is of a final nature. Although the deadline for accepting the proposal has not been formally stipulated, it is generally understood that the Japanese government expects Vietnam to accept or reject it before midnight today. (Reuters, 28th)

Saigon - Authoritative sources today confirmed that Vietnam had received a "veiled ultimatum" from Japan and Thailand, with a deadline expiring at midnight today. A Japanese official here told a United Press reporter that a large number of Japanese naval forces are currently moving south. Authoritative sources also stated that Japanese troops in northern Vietnam are currently being reinforced. In Tokyo (Tokyo of Vietnam), the Japanese air force has been greatly reinforced yesterday. A Japanese official told a United Press reporter that Tokyo has 2,000 Japanese soldiers, Hanoi has a large Japanese air force, and Haiphong and southern Vietnam have Japanese warships, so Vietnam must accept the latest demands of Thailand and Japan. Although all indications here suggest that the final moment is approaching, most well-informed sources believe that some compromise will be reached at the last minute to prevent an outbreak. French sources said today that they believe the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute talks in Tokyo will inevitably fail because the positions of Japan and Thailand are extremely unreasonable. Well-informed sources also said that Vietnam may fight with more than one country, but if Japan goes beyond diplomatically supporting Thailand, Singapore and China are not far away. (United Press, 28th)

Vichy Authorities State: Concessions Have Limits

Vichy - A government spokesman commented on the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire negotiations, saying that the French government has decided on the maximum limit of concessions and cannot concede another inch. The spokesman also said that, according to the Franco-German armistice agreement, France has the right to protect its overseas colonies and must comply with it. According to reports from Shanghai, the claim that Japan's conditions presented to France and rejected by France are Japan's final conditions is now being called an exaggeration here. United Press has learned that French Deputy Premier Darlan notified U.S. Ambassador Leahy on Saturday that France needs war materials to maintain the integrity of Vietnam, and hopes that the United States can sell aircraft, war equipment, etc., and deliver them promptly. It is heard that Washington has not yet responded, but U.S. Secretary of State Hull had previously refused to transport aircraft and war materials to Vietnam. The French Ministry of Propaganda said that Vietnam is effectively under blockade. "We have too few aircraft and troops, and our navy has only one cruiser and several gunboats, but we can still resist the Thai offensive. Our air force has performed better than Thailand, and our navy has also defeated Thai warships. In fact, we have defeated the Thai offensive." The official said that as a result of the recent meeting between Vietnamese Governor Decoux and French military commander in Vietnam Mordant, France is prepared for any eventuality. Each day the current deadlock continues increases the danger. According to France's maximum concessions, Thailand can obtain the entire area west of the Mekong River in Laos province, a narrow strip in northern Cambodia, and the western region, but France cannot cede Pakse and towns east of the Mekong River. France does not intend to propose any new plan, and it should be up to Japan and Thailand to decide what to do. (United Press, 28th)

Vichy - Regarding the negotiations between French and Thai representatives in Tokyo, officials here are keeping silent, insisting that at this stage of the negotiations, all parties concerned should adopt an extremely cautious attitude. Foreign reports that have a different effect are a distortion that erases the facts. It is hoped that the French and foreign press will not be deceived. In short, France's position on the border dispute between Thailand and Vietnam remains unchanged. The current border between Vietnam and Thailand was demarcated by the 1907 treaty, and the Thai government has repeatedly stated that it cannot be changed. The land returned to Vietnam by Thailand under this treaty originally belonged to the Vietnamese Eastern Cambodian state and was only occupied by Thailand in 1867. When Thailand returned this land to Vietnam in 1907, the border demarcated by both sides was quite favorable to Thailand, and the Vietnamese side had given various benefits. Up until June 12, 1940, France and Thailand signed a non-aggression pact based on the 1507 treaty. At this time, although France has accepted Japanese mediation, France's treaty position has not changed as a result. (Havas, 28th)

### Welles Receives Japanese and Soviet Ambassadors Separately

Washington - Undersecretary of State Welles separately received Japanese Ambassador Nomura and Soviet Ambassador Oumansky yesterday afternoon. (Reuters, 28th)

Washington - Undersecretary of State Welles' separate receptions of the Soviet and Japanese ambassadors have aroused considerable speculation in foreign circles, believing that there is a new tension in the Far East. It is reported that Oumansky is quite disappointed that the United States has not been able to resolve the restrictions on the Soviet Union's goods. (United Press, 28th)

Editorial

### Farewell, Dr. Currie

Dr. Currie, the personal representative of U.S. President Roosevelt, and economic expert Dr. Depre, came to China with an investigative mission. After three weeks, he completed his work and flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong the day before yesterday, and will soon return to the United States tomorrow. Based on the earnestness and sincerity expressed by Currie before his departure, it is known that this trip will certainly report the state of China's finances and economy to President Roosevelt. It is expected that American aid to China will sweep away the previous hesitation and become more active and clear, which is truly a blessing for both China and the United States. Only when China and the United States stand on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean can the peace of the Pacific be guaranteed. If there is any imbalance, it will inevitably form a situation of uneven distribution. The Americans have concerns about the West, and both countries will have no peaceful day. Only when they share weal and woe can they help each other in times of difficulty. Understanding this, Dr. Currie's trip was not in vain.

According to international practice, the way to treat envoys from other countries must be commensurate with the meaning of their mission. "I have fine wine, feasting the guests," is praised by poets. If etiquette requires reciprocity, there must be entertainment. Envoys come from afar, and there must be grand gatherings. This is truly a trivial matter, but it is also human nature. Now, although Dr. Currie often said, "I am very grateful for the warm hospitality," in order to avoid directly answering questions about the investigation work, and expressed "If there were not so many banquets, I could have done more research," it is also heard that Dr. Currie completed his complex and complicated work in this very short period of time, and still gained ten pounds of weight before returning. Considering the purpose of entertaining foreign envoys, it is a matter of satisfaction for China, the host, to make them feel comfortable. Moreover, Dr. Currie's mission lies in collecting materials. It is heard that he has collected the materials he wanted to collect, and the fact that this complex material can be completed in a short period of time shows that the Chinese authorities' treatment of guests is not only a trivial matter of entertainment, but also that everything goes smoothly and they can achieve their goals. This cannot be achieved without a sound organization and flexible coordination. Dr. Currie was able to complete his mission because of this, which is also a sign that China's great cause of resistance and construction has been prepared with basic principles and strategies.

"China needs very little, and the United States wants to help a lot." Generally speaking, this seems strange, but it is gratifying. This is because China's inherent virtues are hard work and endurance, poor clothing and simple food. The reason why the war continues to fight repeatedly, the morale is unyielding, and the construction is simple and effective, and the results are doubled, are all based on inherent virtues. We really do not know what items are needed in very small quantities. Some of the things that have been mentioned are, in addition to the economy, new weapons such as aircraft and heavy artillery, which must be urgently needed from the United States. In terms of assistance, the passages of China's coastal ports are controlled by Japanese warships and artillery. Vietnam is also intimidated by the violence of the Japanese side, resulting in the closure of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The only route that can be relied on for assistance is the Burma Road, which is also being destroyed by the Japanese air force. Fortunately, the repair projects trained in China are unusually quick, and the transportation is continuous. However, if Japan advances south at full speed, spies on Malaya, and occupies the Dutch East Indies, the threat to the Burma Road will be even greater. Therefore, American aid to China should pay special attention to the speed and safety of the aid channels. This is one. Whether it is economy, transportation, military affairs, or machinery, they are all products of modern science. Only with skilled technicians can they achieve familiar results. Therefore, although the United States absolutely does not need to send troops to the Chinese front, how to allocate technical talents to China should be a consideration. This is another one. Dr. Currie will not find it difficult to understand the complex situation of China's economy. Looting is common, and the more urgent the changes in the situation, the deeper the economic damage. Therefore, the New York Free Pound was able to be properly handled by the British. However, China still has no proper way to deal with the Shanghai black market. Although the conversion of U.S. dollars into savings deposits has been a preliminary reorganization, the unpredictable conspiracies of the future are watching beside it and chasing after it. The United States has a surplus of gold and should find other ways to use it. Then, how to support China's legal tender to coordinate China's wartime economy is another one. We really do not know how many items China's authorities have suggested to Dr. Currie and others that are needed in addition to these few items. Even with these items, we are also happy to hear Dr. Currie's promise that China will never be disappointed. Moreover, China's assistance from the United States certainly cannot be without compensation. The way of compensation may follow the general commercial way. In China, which has always valued good faith, promises are the most reliable guarantee, and the general material guarantee conditions should be secondary in terms of method, and even unnecessary in nature. What China especially wants to repay the United States is: an unlimited commercial gateway, the long-term stability of the Pacific Ocean, the promotion and development of international justice and human civilization, the corresponding and enthusiastic friendship between the spirits of the Chinese and American peoples, the super-literary alliance of sharing weal and woe and jointly suppressing the strong, and the life-and-death friendship of guarding democracy. Before continuing to give China aid, have Dr. Currie and others felt that they have already received this kind of reward and returned?

Japanese Residents in Vietnam Ordered to Prepare for Evacuation at Any Time

Hanoi - All 400 Japanese residents in Vietnam are now hastily packing up and preparing to leave the country in accordance with the notice issued yesterday by the Japanese Consul-Generals in Hanoi and Saigon, ordering them to prepare for a full evacuation at any time. This is the second action in six months. The first evacuation order was issued on August 22 last year, just before France accepted Japan's request to station troops in Hanoi. According to Japanese sources in Hanoi, the French authorities in Vietnam are now complying with the resolution of the emergency meeting of military and political leaders convened by Vietnamese Governor Decoux on February 26. This resolution unanimously opposed the large-scale partition of Vietnam. Japanese observers said that the French authorities in Vietnam took this stance because they believed that Britain and the United States would prevent Japan from implementing the proposed solution to Thailand and Vietnam by coercive means. Observers all believed that if it were not for orders from Vichy or forced by a large Japanese army, the French authorities would not change this attitude. Observers also said that when Japan attempted to station troops in Vietnam last August, the French authorities used this delaying tactic to deal with it and relied on the power of Britain and the United States to prevent Japan from using force. (Reuters, 28th)

Osaka - According to news from here today, Osaka Shosen Kaisha has instructed all returning ships to prepare to load Japanese residents evacuated from Vietnam. The Bangkok Maru, which came to Japan from Bangkok via various ports in Vietnam today, and the Raplata Maru, which departed from Kobe yesterday and will arrive in Haiphong in eight days, have both been ordered to reserve cabins for Japanese residents evacuated from Vietnam. (Reuters, 28th)

Tokyo - Well-informed Japanese sources claimed that the success or failure of the Japanese mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute conference will directly affect the French-Japanese economic talks on Vietnam, and may eventually affect the relationship between Vichy and Berlin. (Reuters, 28th)

Strengthening Defenses on the Burmese Border; Expansion of Singapore's Minefield

Singapore - People here today regard the situation in Vietnam as extremely serious because of the rumour that Japan has issued a real "veiled ultimatum," saying that if France does not accept it before midnight tonight, it will resort to coercive measures to implement the resolution. In view of France's public declaration yesterday that it will not make any more concessions, it seems difficult to imagine how these two opposing opinions will be reconciled. If a public conflict occurs, then given the delicate state of affairs in the Far East, it is not known what will happen. However, Singapore is confident that it can now cope with any emergency, and the recent acceleration of the deployment of defenses in Burma has also made great progress. Their naval power outside Vietnamese waters is also considerable. (Reuters, 28th)

Singapore - Officials announced today that the entrances to the east of Singapore Port and the anchorage will be mined from March 3, prohibiting navigation. This new measure has expanded the existing minefield area around Singapore. Ships entering will be responsible for their own safety. (Reuters, 28th)

Tokyo - When someone asked the Information Bureau spokesman Ishii today about the rumour that the Japanese women and children in Singapore are now evacuating, whether the authorities had ordered it, Ishii denied it, but said that the Japanese residents are now evacuating voluntarily. (Reuters, 28th)

Japanese Spokesman Ishii Claims No Ultimatum Was Given to Vietnam

Tokyo - Japanese government spokesman Ishii told foreign reporters this morning that the situation of the Japanese mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute is now very tense. "We are not engaged in a war of nerves. We are now making real preparations, but we have not given an ultimatum to the French side, because mediators cannot issue ultimatums." Ishii denied the rumour that nine Japanese warships had gone to Saigon, and did not confirm the news that Thailand had accepted Japan's final proposal, but said that Japan's final proposal could be regarded as an indication that Thailand had accepted it. Ishii admitted that Japan had promised to respect Vietnam's territorial integrity in return for the agreement concluded between Japan and Vietnam last year, allowing Japanese troops to be stationed in northern Vietnam. However, he then added in his reply that Japan suggested that Vietnam return land to Thailand, which is fully in line with the agreement. As for Japan's promise regarding land, it has nothing to do with the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute. Ishii also said that the French ambassador visited Matsuoka at 2:00 PM yesterday and stayed for a long time, but refused to reveal the nature of the conversation. (Reuters, 28th)

Japan is Eager to Establish a Co-Prosperity Sphere and is Dissatisfied with France's Delaying Tactics

Tokyo - "Asahi Shimbun" reported today that the Japanese government is now firmly opposed to Vietnam's attempt to delay accepting Japan's proposed mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, because this prolonged delay will lead to interference by third parties in the East Asian co-prosperity sphere and will make Southeast Asia "Balkanized," refusing Japan's leadership in East Asia. The authorities have now issued an order to evacuate Japanese residents from Vietnam and ordered them to prepare to leave the country at noon on July 7, when the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire expires. It is said that this is a plan to prevent the overall situation from deteriorating. (Reuters, 28th)

Germany is Trying Hard to Win Over Japan; It is Rumored that Matsuoka Will Visit Berlin

New York - The discussions between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima in Berlin, and the news that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will soon go to Berlin, are regarded here as another indication that Germany is trying hard to win over Japan and wants it to join the war in accordance with the Tripartite Pact. Japan is also willing to only have a conflict with Britain when Britain's defeat seems inevitable, so that it can occupy as much of the Earth's area as possible without the need to conflict with the United States. The news from Tokyo yesterday made the United States pay attention to the statement issued by the Japanese spokesman on February 18, "We want to reiterate that the Tripartite Pact aims at peace," but the value of this kind of statement is not accepted by the United States. This can be seen from Bullitt's speech at the New York Foreign Publishing Industry Club last night. Bullitt said, "Love your neighbor as yourself. If you say this to Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists, you will only hear mockery. We cannot expect them to give honor or benevolence in dealing with us or any other country. Germany, Italy, and Japan have openly united against us in accordance with the alliance they concluded in Berlin five months ago." Bullitt did not speak in the capacity of a policy maker or ambassador. The State Department sent his speech to various newspapers, and the meaning can be imagined. Observers here are deeply convinced that the United States, both government and public, regards Japan as being in cahoots with Germany and Italy, and as a country that hates the freedom and democracy on which the United States was founded. Matsuoka's recent demands regarding Oceania, although later information from Tokyo has slightly explained them, have ultimately aroused widespread condemnation here, criticizing them as being arrogant and containing serious meanings, because when Matsuoka mentioned the living space of 800 million people, he was referring not to a few islands in the Pacific, but to a very vast area. The importance of this issue is so great that Matsuoka cannot express his personal opinions, so what he said must be the basis for the formulation of Japanese policy. (Reuters, 28th)

### Japanese Troops are Extremely Active Near Hainan Island and Guangzhou. Naval Base Engineering is Careless; Preparations for a Southern Blitzkrieg are Incomplete.

Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman said that Japanese troops preparing to advance south are extremely active near Hainan Island and Guangzhou. Japan is using Hainan Island as a base for advancing south, so it is strengthening the island, especially the defenses of Yulin Port at the southern end of the island. The Japanese army is also building new military supply depots and bases along the coast of Guangdong, including Dapeng Bay. (Reuters, 28th)

Hong Kong - Chinese sources said that the Japanese naval base on Hainan Island, which is used as a springboard for advancing south, has been completed after twenty months of intensive work. There are three bases: Yulin Port in the south, Qinglan Port in the east, and Yangpu Port in the west. All three bases have airfields, hangars, factories, and oil pools. Some barracks have been modernized to accommodate German technical experts and military advisors. Military experts pointed out that no large naval base can be built within two years, and Japan lacks military materials and copper and iron, and is far from Hainan Island, so the engineering of these three bases must be very careless. The docks are quite large and can accommodate destroyers and light cruisers, and can be used for inspection and minor repairs. As for the Chinese rumour that there are 100,000 Japanese troops on Hainan Island, it is inevitable that it is an exaggeration. According to recent official news, there is one division and one brigade of Japanese troops on Hainan Island, with a total of 30,000 officers and soldiers. These soldiers are being guided by experts and receiving parachute training, and are practicing blitzkrieg, but they currently lack blitzkrieg equipment. It is heard that the necessary weapons are being shipped to the island from Japan. Chinese guerrillas are still active in Wenchang, Danxian, Qiongdong, Ding'an, and Chengmai. The Japanese army loses 200 people every month. Japanese warplanes, marines, and regular troops are still being continuously sent to the island, and new recruits recruited in the Chinese-occupied areas are currently being trained to supplement the Japanese army. (International News Service, 28th)

Tokyo - The South China Japanese Fleet News Department said yesterday that Japanese naval aircraft continued to attack Chinese industrial areas and the Burma Road. A team of Japanese aircraft continued to attack the Gejiu tin smelter, and especially focused on a new factory built northeast of Gejiu, resulting in the destruction of almost the entire city. Another team of Japanese aircraft penetrated deep into the upper reaches of the Nujiang River and caused serious damage to the Zhendong (transliteration) Bridge on the Burma Road. (Reuters, 28th)

### Ma Buqing Donates Funds for Education; Government Order Commends Him

Chongqing. An order from the National Government on the 28th states: The Executive Yuan submitted a report from the Ministry of Education and the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission stating that Ma Buqing of Ningxia County, Gansu Province, had donated over 1.4 million yuan to the private Qingyun School in Wuwei. This was found to be in accordance with the regulations for commending donations to education. In addition to the Ministry of Education awarding a first-class certificate, they requested review and commendation, and the granting of an honorary plaque. Upon investigation, it was found that Ma Buqing had generously donated a large sum to benefit students, demonstrating genuine enthusiasm for education. It was deemed appropriate to issue a public commendation and bestow upon him an honorary plaque inscribed "Cultivating Talent for the Nation" to encourage and serve as an example. This order is hereby issued. (Telegraph from the 28th)

### Various Areas in Sichuan Province Celebrate Receiving Timely Rain

Chongqing. Last winter, Sichuan Province experienced very little rainfall, leading to widespread concerns about a poor harvest this year, which would further exacerbate the food supply problem.

### Lu Yonghuang Travels from Hong Kong to Chongqing

Hong Kong. Lu Yonghuang, the esteemed father of Xuan Nan, the deceased member and secretary-general of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee, was summoned by the central government. He arrived in Hong Kong in the middle of this month and departed for Chongqing by plane yesterday. Before his departure, he gave a brief statement, saying that while saddened by his son Xuan Nan's sacrifice for the country, he also felt immensely honored. Xuan Nan, whose courtesy name was used, was born on the 29th day of the twelfth month in the year of Yiyou, three years before the founding of the Republic (1909). He was martyred on November 19th, 1940, at the age of thirty-two. He graduated from Shanghai College of Law and Politics in the summer of 1933 and worked briefly in a government ministry before going to Japan to study local autonomy at the graduate school of Waseda University. He returned to China in 1936 and served on the Local Autonomy Planning Committee of the Central Party Headquarters. Before the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident), he established the International United Telegraph Agency to gather Japanese intelligence and contribute to the government's efforts. His news was accurate and highly regarded in the journalistic circles of Nanjing. He ceased operations when the National Government moved westward. Subsequently, he left Nanjing for Wuhan, where he and his comrades founded the National Diplomatic Association. After the retreat from Wuhan, he moved westward to Chongqing and continued to operate the National Diplomatic Association. Later, with the approval of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, he participated in the second session of the Party and Government Training Class at the Central Training Corps. After graduating, he was appointed by the central government as an executive member and secretary-general of the Nanjing Municipal Party Committee and as a colonel-level inspector of the Three Principles of the People Youth Corps, as well as an inspector of the Party and Government Committee. He arrived in Shanghai in August 1939, and shortly after went to Nanjing to work. The responsibilities he shouldered were extremely heavy, and he suffered repeated setbacks. Unexpectedly, he was arrested at midnight on August 8th, 1940, and detained for a hundred days. Resisting stubbornly and refusing to yield, he was martyred at Yuhuatai, a suburb of Nanjing, on November 19th at Chenshi (7-9 AM). (Dispatch from the 27th)

### Hog Bristle Prices Increased Separately

Chongqing. The Chongqing Provisional Municipal Council previously passed a resolution at its third general meeting requesting the government to protect industry and commerce and strive for the international market for hog bristle exports. The council has now received instructions from the Executive Yuan stating that the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance has increased hog bristle prices separately according to the situation in various parts of the country. In Chongqing, Chengdu, Wanxian and other places, the price of each dan (approx. 50 kg) of black, cooked bristles (No. 27 grade) in a standard bale was increased to 1,800 yuan, and the price of each dan of white, raw bristles (No. 27 grade) in a standard bale was increased to 1,300 yuan, effective from December 30, 1940. The Trade Commission will purchase according to the announced prices to encourage export trade. (Dispatch from the 28th)

### Silk Production in Sichuan Province Increases

Chongqing. Before the war, 80% of the raw silk produced annually in Sichuan Province was sold to the United States. Currently, 50% of all raw silk exported from Sichuan is purchased by Rangoon, and the rest is sold in New York. In the past two years, the amount of Sichuan silk exported to British Burma has increased significantly. The highest annual production in Sichuan is around 30,000 dan (approx. 1,500 metric tons). Because American merchants require better quality silk, the same amount of silkworm cocoons produces one-third less raw silk when processed for export to the US market compared to when processed for sale in the Burmese market. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

### Four Banks Plan to Offer Special Agricultural Loans

Chongqing. It is reported in newspapers that the joint office of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China plans to offer special agricultural loans to support righteous people, veterans, and families of soldiers engaged in combat to engage in production. The measures are as follows: (1) For righteous people, they will first be organized into agricultural groups before loans are granted. Skilled workers should be granted loans through industrial cooperatives. All loans should be guaranteed by the government or charitable organizations. (2) For veterans, veterans of the second and third classes should be organized into agricultural or industrial production groups based on their abilities, and loans should be provided to assist them. (3) For families of soldiers engaged in combat, loan procedures should be simplified as much as possible, and a cultivation assistance campaign should be promoted. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

### Three Japanese Cargo Ships Built Specifically for Transporting Minerals and Iron from Central China

Tokyo. The Hochi Shimbun reports that the Japanese government has decided to build three special cargo ships specifically for transporting minerals and iron ore from Daye and Wuhu in China to Japan. Due to insufficient transportation capacity, ore from these two places is piled up at mines and docks as high as mountains. The output of iron ore from these two places has increased threefold compared to before the war. The new cargo ships can carry 5,750 tons and are equipped with special cranes for loading and unloading ore. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

### British Forces Capture Nakfa in East African Battle; Rumor that German Mechanized Units Supporting Italy Have Suffered Setbacks in North Africa

Khartoum. British forces have occupied Kirmt, thirty miles north of Corren in Italian Eritrea, without encountering any resistance. Nakfa, fifty miles north of Kirmt, has also been captured by British forces attacking from Cor Cob. British forces captured Karora on February 9th and began the southern offensive on Corren. They have now occupied Kirmt, more than 200 miles from their starting point in Karora. No news has been reported from other fronts in Eritrea and Abyssinia. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

Cairo. An RAF communiqué issued yesterday, describing the air force's assistance to the army's advance on the northeastern Italian lines, stated that RAF bombing of enemy concentrations and supply depots in the Corren area had been quite effective. The motor vehicle depot at Asabemada was bombed, and ammunition dumps and other targets near Massawa were attacked. RAF planes also bombed a railway bridge near Addis Ababa, scoring a direct hit and damaging the bridge and tracks. In the past few hours, RAF planes have bombed four enemy concentrations and supply depots, all with considerable success. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

London. Recent reports from Cairo indicate that the British occupation of Mogadishu, the capital of Italian Somaliland, has severely demoralized Italian troops. Thousands of Italian prisoners have already been taken, and more continue to arrive. South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts has telegraphed congratulations to Major General Cunningham, commander of the British forces in Italian Somaliland, saying that he was delighted to hear that the officers and soldiers under his command had captured the capital of Somaliland, achieving a glorious victory. He added that the terrain in Somaliland was rugged and transportation was difficult, but the rapid progress of the British forces and their great achievements were a source of pride for all. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

Cairo. The Nile Army has repelled German mechanized units that were attempting to prevent the British advance and have advanced further from Benghazi. Italian Somaliland and Eritrea were almost entirely in British hands last night. The outcome of the initial clash between British and German forces in Africa is highly secretive and has not yet been revealed. However, it is claimed here that the British were completely victorious last night. The German mechanized units, which had repeatedly defeated Allied forces in Europe at the beginning of the war, were defeated by the long-serving Central Army. According to British officers, the British army is "eager to capture the German army alive." British forces in Eritrea recently occupied Kirmt and Nakfa, so their northern force is now less than fifty miles from the besieged railway center of Corren. People in Cairo believe that General Graziani, the Italian commander-in-chief in Africa, will be traveling from Tripoli to Tunis. His luggage has already arrived in Tunis, so it is believed that Graziani will return there. (International News Service dispatch from the 28th)

Washington. The International News Service learned last night that the US government firmly believes that control over Italy has fallen into German hands. According to private sources received by the US government, although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is still the leader of the Italian government, actual control has fallen into the hands of the German secret police and the German army. Senior officials in Washington believe that this development is one of the most significant events in the war because it is sufficient to hinder the victorious advance of the British Nile Army in Libya. It is believed here that one of the main purposes of the German takeover of Italy is to prevent a revolution. It has been reported that demonstrations often occur in Italian cities, but these have now stopped, indicating that a powerful authority has suppressed all traitors. News has spread that British and German forces have come into contact in North Africa, which is of great interest here. It is generally believed that this clash, since the landing of the large German army and the demotion of the Italian High Command to a dependency, is a prelude to the increased warfare between the British and German forces. (International News Service dispatch from the 28th)

Rome. The Roman "Regime Fascista" newspaper reported yesterday that the appearance of German forces in North Africa demonstrates two points: first, that Britain does not control the Mediterranean because the German forces came via the Mediterranean, and second, that there is complete unity of the Axis powers. The newspaper said: "The appearance of well-organized German forces in Africa shows that the British claim to control the Mediterranean is entirely fabricated." The newspaper is owned by Foreign Minister Ciano. The newspaper went on to say: "The transport of a fully equipped German force shows that maritime transport is very smooth. The news of German forces in Africa also destroys rumors that Germany only wants to take care of its own interests and achieve its own victory, and that Germany would only pay attention to Africa when it was occupied by a large number of British forces. The two leaders of the Axis powers have said that they have only one front, one war, and a common victory, and this is indeed the truth." (Associated Press dispatch from the 28th)

London. A Reuters war correspondent reports that South African and Dominion troops have crushed an entire Italian division on the Juba River. Three Italian brigade commanders were captured, two of whom had been decorated in World War I. Most of the prisoners taken were South African natives, numbering three thousand. A unit from Natal captured more enemy troops at Chilieba than their own numbers. Another unit from Transvaal captured 300 enemy troops. The dense jungle on both sides of the Juba River is full of dead Italian soldiers. The number of prisoners taken at Chilieba is currently difficult to count. These prisoners are grateful for the good treatment they are receiving, but they do not believe the news that Tobruk, Benghazi, and Mijiga have fallen. It is reported that the Italian side transferred two elite regiments from Harar, Abyssinia, to fight at Juba, but they were also annihilated. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

### Rumor that British-Turkish Consultations Have Led to Agreement; Adopting a Policy of Mutual Assistance to Cope with Contingencies; Military Experts Continue to Discuss Technical Issues

Istanbul. It was stated here last night that if Germany were to pass through Bulgaria and threaten the Dardanelles or other important British-Turkish interests, Britain and Turkey have already united to provide mutual assistance and cooperate diplomatically. It is believed that Britain and Turkey have adopted a unified policy to cope with any eventuality, which was achieved during the repeated meetings between British Foreign Secretary Eden, British Chief of Staff Dill, and Turkish representatives here. It is rumored that the agreement contains precise provisions on areas where Turkey will not tolerate foreign activity. We can recall that on Monday, the Turkish Foreign Minister stated that "Turkey cannot turn a blind eye to foreign activities in certain areas," but the Foreign Minister did not clarify these areas. It is believed that the boundaries set by Eden, Dill, and the Turkish government also include Thessaloniki. After the conclusion of these talks, it is believed that Eden and Dill will meet with the military attaché of Yugoslavia stationed in Turkey, with the aim of enabling Turkey and Yugoslavia to take unified action against Axis aggression in the Balkans. Eden was welcomed wherever he appeared in public. (International News Service dispatch from the 28th)

Ankara. It is said that the talks between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Turkish officials were extremely satisfactory. Were it not for the precise wording of the communiqué issued after the two sides decided to hold meetings and consultations, there would be no need for continued talks. Eden is scheduled to meet with Turkish President Inonu tonight. Eden departs from Adana Airport tonight, and British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Cripps had a general conversation with Eden this morning. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

Istanbul. The Turkish "Ulus" newspaper published an article warmly welcoming British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Imperial Chief of General Staff General Dill. It is reported that the Turkish people respectfully salute these two outstanding representatives of Britain. The welcome given to Eden and Dill in Istanbul is an expression of the friendship of Turkey's goodwill and trust in Britain. Britain is a very influential factor in Turkey's destiny. Eden is a politician who will play an important role in British imperial history, and he is known to have always advocated British-Turkish friendship. The Turkish people sincerely hope that the arrival of the two honored guests will not only feel joyful but will also yield positive results that benefit both Britain and Turkey. (Reuters dispatch from the 28th)

Madrid. The "Arriba" newspaper here commented on British Foreign Secretary Eden's activities in Istanbul, saying that although Eden was received by important members of the Turkish government, one thing that cannot be ignored is that before Eden arrived in Turkey, German Ambassador von Papen hosted a banquet for the Turkish Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and other cabinet members and showed the film "Victory on the Western Front." Between the diplomatic secrets in Eden's briefcase and the German film, the future of the Near East will be decided. But no matter whether the new front organized by Britain in the Balkans is successful, it can never change the fate of the war. It can be asserted that in the history of all countries, geographical factors occupy an extremely important position, and this is also the case this time. But no matter how the situation in the Mediterranean develops, it is the Western Front, not the Eastern Front, that will determine the fate of the war. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 28th)

### British Minister to Bulgaria Warns Bulgaria that if it Allows German Forces to Infiltrate, Britain Will Immediately Prepare to Attack

Sofia. According to unconfirmed reports, German tank units crossed the Danube River from Romania early this morning. Before this news had spread, British Minister to Bulgaria Rendel issued a stern warning to Bulgaria, indicating that British diplomatic relations with Bulgaria were close to breaking down. It is reported that the German troops who are said to have infiltrated Bulgaria are "not just a few thousand, but hundreds." The British military is also preparing to attack immediately. Officials here have neither confirmed the rumor of German troops entering Bulgaria nor commented on the British Minister's warning. The British Minister's remarks have increased belief that Britain may launch an offensive in Bulgarian airspace or on Bulgarian land immediately to prevent Germany from advancing towards Greece. At the same time, it is heard that heavy snow at the Bulgarian-Romanian border may hinder the expected German advance. Rendel has stated that Britain will not hesitate to declare war and has hinted that Britain can defeat Germany. It has been pointed out that Germany is adopting a strategy of gradual infiltration rather than a large-scale invasion in order to prevent Britain from having a pretext for war and to stand by and watch Germany tighten its control over Bulgaria, but Britain cannot tolerate this. Rendel said that German newspapers, transportation, the army, and the police are all virtually under Nazi control. He added, "When British officials leave Bulgaria, that will be the beginning of the tragedy." (International News Service dispatch from the 28th)

Capital of Switzerland. Regarding the claim that German troops have entered Bulgaria, although it is being widely circulated in London, Berlin has repeatedly and emphatically denied it. Observers here generally believe that, given the firmness of the German denial, it is credible that German troops will not take action against Bulgaria for at least several weeks. German diplomatic activities in the Balkans are extremely active, so they can use methods other than military action to promote their current policies without resorting to force immediately. Moreover, a large number of German troops are currently gathered in Romania. If the German command believes it is necessary, they can order these troops to move south and attack Greece at any time. However, it is difficult to grasp what intentions the German military authorities currently have, so when predicting their future actions, people should not stick to preconceived notions based on the above denials. For example, the "Lausanne Gazette's" correspondent in Berlin cabled, "It is not entirely impossible that German troops will suddenly attack Greece via Yugoslavia to outflank the British Near East forces." (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

London. The British Broadcasting Corporation announced tonight that the British Minister to Bulgaria, Rendel, stated in Sofia that the number of German "technicians" infiltrating Bulgaria is increasing daily. The diplomatic relations between Britain and Bulgaria are on the verge of breaking down. If British diplomatic personnel withdraw, Bulgaria will become a war zone, which would be extremely detrimental to the country. It is hoped that the country will not follow in the footsteps of Romania. (Havas dispatch from the 27th)

### Exchange of Ratifications Between Hungary and Yugoslavia

Budapest: Following the arrival of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković in the Hungarian capital, he proceeded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today to exchange ratification documents concerning the Treaty of Friendship between the two nations, which was concluded last December, with Foreign Minister Bárdossy. Regent Prince Paul was also present at the event. Additionally, Foreign Minister Bárdossy hosted a banquet last night in honor of Marković, during which both ministers delivered congratulatory speeches. Bárdossy stated that the relations between the two nations have been based on friendship and cooperation, which is highly beneficial to the maintenance of peace in Southeastern Europe. This spirit of cooperation is reaffirmed by the Treaty of Friendship concluded between the two parties, which creates a favorable atmosphere that is not only indispensable for building a new European order but also contributes to the current policies of the friendly nations of Germany and Italy. In response, Minister Marković stated that as Bárdossy had said, the Treaty of Friendship concluded between the two nations is highly beneficial to the maintenance of peace in Southeastern Europe. Under the cooperation of the two major neighboring nations of Germany and Italy, the commitment to peace is a blessing for both nations and even the entire Southeastern Europe. (Havas, 27th)

Budapest: Following the exchange of ratification documents for the Treaty of Friendship between Hungary and Yugoslavia, observers here have commented that regardless of future developments in the Balkan Peninsula, the two nations seem to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool. According to this treaty, both parties can benefit economically, as they can both strengthen their national defenses and increase production and trade. As Hungary has no direct access to the sea, its goods will be exported through the ports along the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia, in turn, can trade with the Soviet Union through Hungary. (Havas, 27th)

### Dutch Residents in Japan Voluntarily Evacuate

Batavia: According to official wireless communications, the tension in the Pacific has prompted some Dutch women and children to return from Japan. However, it is solemnly stated that this is not an official evacuation, as the Dutch East Indies government has not issued any advice or orders regarding evacuation. This is entirely voluntary. (Reuters, 28th)

### Lull in Fighting in Albania

Athens: The Greek Information Department states that the atmosphere on the Albanian front remains harsh, hindering large-scale military operations. However, Greek artillery continues to bombard enemy positions with success, and shells have exploded in Italian trenches, causing heavy damage. An Italian column in a certain area was hit, suffering severe casualties. The Greek air force continues to bomb military targets, depots, enemy columns en route, and concentrated motor transport.

### Clues to Japanese Southern Advance Obtained from Admiral Oikawa's Documents; The Resulting Tensions in the Pacific; Alcott Elucidates the Cause and Effect

The well-known news reporter Alcott published an article in the Continental Daily yesterday, entitled "Admiral Oikawa's Documents," analyzing the relationship between the Oikawa plane crash and the recent changes in the Far East situation in the past two or three weeks. His words reveal much that others have not. Now, his original text will be translated as follows: The arrival of the British ambassador to Shanghai reminds people of the various problems, opinions, coincidences, and the resulting tensions in the Far East in the past two or three weeks. My observations may be incorrect, but after reviewing the results, I believe that all the alarming events in the past two or three weeks, such as the reissuance of evacuation advisories by the United Kingdom and the United States, the arrival of Australian troops in Singapore, and the deaths of important Japanese figures such as Admiral Oikawa and Rear Admiral Suga in the Japanese plane crash in Guangdong earlier this month, are all related. To date, what happened at the time of the Japanese plane crash is still being debated. The Chinese side still insists that the plane was shot down by guerrillas, while the Japanese side claims that the plane crashed on its own. It is not important who obtained the bodies.

Chinese Side Obtains Oikawa's Documents

What is noteworthy is that the Chinese side claimed to have obtained documents from Oikawa's remains. According to reports from Chongqing, after examining these documents, it was discovered that Oikawa was flying south with his subordinates to participate in work related to the Japanese advance to the South. After the Chinese side released this news, no further extremely important news was transmitted. However, within the shortest time after the Japanese plane crash and Oikawa's death, several important events occurred. A few days after Oikawa's death, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Fadden made his shocking statement, claiming that the situation in the Pacific was serious. Also, the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, canceled his trip to Hong Kong, and Shanghai received reports of considerable diplomatic activity in Chongqing. The Japanese plane crashed on February 5, but the news was not released until February 9. We know that the plane crashed in an area controlled by Chinese guerrillas. Other than that, it cannot be verified which side's view is correct. However, according to reliable foreign sources, the Chinese side did see the documents carried by Admiral Oikawa.

Important Measures Develop One After Another

The question that arises is whether the changes that have occurred in the past week have been triggered by the information in those documents. Several important figures believe this to be the case. For example, Fadden said that he had just received a report, which made him feel that the situation in the Pacific was serious. Fadden made this statement only three or four days after the news of Admiral Oikawa's death was released. Holland, for some declared reason, recalled the Dutch ships sailing in the sea to Manila. The Chizukawa Maru, not far from Manila Bay, also turned back halfway upon receiving a signal from the Corregidor US fortress. On February 14, the US State Department in Washington reiterated its evacuation advisory, ordering American expatriates in Shanghai and other Far East ports to evacuate. Subsequently, news came that mines had been placed in the Singapore Strait. According to the information I have obtained, the British started to lay mines in the strait after the news of Admiral Oikawa's death was released. Soon after Singapore buried mines, the Queen Mary and several other British ships suddenly arrived there, carrying about one division of Australian troops. Qualified observers believe that these Australian troops were originally destined for Egypt but suddenly landed in Singapore after receiving alarming news. A few hours later, the British authorities reiterated their previous order, advising British expatriates in Shanghai to evacuate.

Tokyo is Extremely Uneasy

Since the occurrence of the above-mentioned events, Tokyo has been shrouded in an atmosphere of distress and anxiety. In fact, senior officials in the Japanese capital have shown signs of panic, which makes people believe that something bad must have happened, that is, the plan that they originally thought the world was unaware of was suddenly exposed. Later, they put forward some foolish suggestions for mediating the war, officially claiming to be "mediators for disputes in various parts of the world." Then they went back on their word, denying that they had made mediation proposals, and ultimately failed. Japan's implementation of its southern advance plan is no longer as rampant and clamorous as in the past because the United Kingdom and the United States have prepared. It is not known whether the war in the Pacific will be avoided because of this. The current fact is that the United Kingdom and the United States deeply feel that all the information they have is very important and cannot be taken lightly. Therefore, Senator George of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that he expects various developments in the Far East, and Fadden has repeatedly stated that although the current situation is not as alarming as in the past, it is still serious. I believe that when the truth behind the Far East tension in the past three weeks is finally revealed, it will be known that the Oikawa document incident has a considerable relationship with the tension in the situation.

### Extension of Shanghai West Special Police Establishment Period; Said to be Changed to the 15th of This Month

After the "Police Authority Agreement" in Shanghai West was signed on the 1st of last month, Chen Gongbo "appointed" Pan Zhijie as the "Director-General of the Shanghai West Special Police Headquarters," and at the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council recommended Christopher as the "Deputy Director-General." The two parties negotiated on organizational issues. The "Headquarters" was originally scheduled to be established today. It is now learned that due to budget issues, it has not been resolved so far, and personnel issues have not been completely decided, so it is difficult to achieve it as scheduled. According to the Japanese-language Continental New Daily yesterday, Pan Zhijie has flown to Nanjing on the 25th to make contact with Nanjing, and Chen Gongbo also left Shanghai on the 28th, so the Shanghai West "Special Police Headquarters" may not be established for a while.

According to news from foreign sources, the "Special Police," which was originally scheduled to be established today, will be changed to March 15 because the meeting between "Director-General" Pan Zhijie and "Deputy Director-General" Christopher has not ended as scheduled. It is heard that the list of more than 60 candidates for the last batch of "Special Police" recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department has been submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday for approval, and then handed over to Chen Gongbo for "appointment." If there are no problems with the proposed candidates from both sides, the main problems in the negotiations between Pan Zhijie and Christopher will also be resolved, and the "Special Police" can be expected in mid-March.

### Sino-American Daily Held Economic Symposium Yesterday to Discuss US-Japan War and the Future of Shanghai

The situation in South Asia is becoming increasingly urgent. Shanghai is the main international market in the Far East, and its situation is particularly bad. In the event of a US-Japan war, what impact will the future of the Shanghai market have? What preparations should China's industrial, commercial, and financial circles make in advance? These are all issues that are currently of great concern to all sectors. In order to gather ideas and broaden their horizons, the local Sino-American Daily invited 18 well-known international affairs experts and economic affairs experts to hold a symposium at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss the theme of "US-Japan War and the Future of the Shanghai Market." After the experts shared their insights, they had a thorough and precise analysis of the situation, and a sharp and accurate observation of the future. They also had important suggestions on the preparations that the industrial and commercial circles should make and the countermeasures that the government should take. The discussion lasted for four hours before everyone dispersed happily.

### Welsh National Day

The Welsh British expatriates in this port will present flowers in front of the Goddess of Peace on the Bund at 8:30 this morning. At 6:30 in the evening, there will be a dinner at the auditorium at 1623 Avenue Road to celebrate the National Day together. Tomorrow, there will also be a service at the Suzhou Road Union Church, which is scheduled to start at 10:45 am. Sir George, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, will also attend the flower presentation ceremony.

### Batch of Japanese Expatriates Retreating from Manila Passes Through Shanghai; It is Said that US-Japan Relations are Deteriorating; It is Still Difficult to Predict Whether a Conflict Will Occur

Amid the urgent situation in the South Pacific, the Ryuta Maru, which was returning to Japan from Manila, arrived at the Huishan Wharf at 7:30 am yesterday due to fog en route. The ship carried a total of 100 passengers, 14 of whom disembarked in Shanghai. Among the passengers were Eijiro Kondo, an advisor to the East Asia Shipping Company who was going to inspect the South Seas, as well as Kiyotaro Kanegae, who had lived in Manila for 35 years. Toyoki Ishikawa, Deputy Minister of the Mitsubishi Mining and Metals Department. Shintaro Kumagai, Deputy President of the Koyo Industrial Company. And Toshisaburo Suzuki, a civil servant of the Asia Development Board. Kiyotaro Kanegae has resided in Manila for 25 years and is the Deputy Chairman of the Japanese Resident Group in the area. It is said that the Pacific issue surrounding the United States and Japan has recently become urgent. Japanese people in the area usually return to their country every year, and now most of them are preparing to evacuate. There are about 25,000 Japanese people in the area. The U.S. fleet currently in Manila is gathering many ships, starting with the flagship. The local U.S. authorities are interfering with Japanese expatriates, and Overseas Chinese are taking the opportunity to expand anti-Japanese propaganda to increase friction between the United States and Japan. Therefore, the U.S.-Japan relations there have reached the worst possible situation. Recently, the situation has become increasingly worse. It is difficult to predict whether there will be a direct conflict between the United States and Japan in the future. According to Eijiro Kondo, after the Japanese power penetrated into the South Pacific, the United Kingdom is now paying attention to Hong Kong and Singapore and is actively strengthening the defense of Hong Kong. At the same time, the U.S.-Japan relations have become increasingly tense.

### Total Number of Passengers on Buses and Trolley Cars Last Year Reached Over 230 Million

The Shanghai Municipal Council's annual report on the general situation of various public utilities mentions the general situation of buses and trolley cars, which is described as follows:

Bus Company

Fares

The bus fares were increased twice last year. The first increase was implemented on April 15, with a general increase of 45%. The second increase was implemented on December 17, with an increase of 25%. The reason for the fare increase was the continued devaluation of the national currency and the contraction of foreign exchange, which led to a sharp increase in operating costs. If the fares were not increased, it would be difficult for the company to maintain operations.

Routes

Route 17, which operated from Jing'an Temple to Xiaoshadu Road from June of the previous year, was intended to promote Jiaozhou Park. After it was put into operation, the fare revenue was not enough to offset the expenses, and it was finally announced to stop on October 31 of the past year. The section from the Bund to Weihaiwei Road, which originally belonged to Route 14, was changed to Route 4 from July 17. The table below shows the comparison of bus mileage and passenger numbers between last year and the previous year:

Mileage

1939: 6,656,299 miles

1940: 7,014,672 miles

Passengers

86,060,656 people

86,984,190 people

Shanghai Electric Trolley Car Company

Last year, the Shanghai Electric Trolley Car Company, in view of the contraction of foreign exchange and the depreciation of the national currency, which led to a sharp increase in expenses, immediately presented to the Bureau for approval to increase the first-class fare from an average of 3.71 cents per mile to 5.02 cents and the third-class fare from 2.54 cents to 3.43 cents from June 17. According to the company, when it requested a price increase in November of the previous year, the exchange rate was about 5.5 pence. The exchange rate continued to fall and prices continued to rise in the first half of last year, so it had to apply for a price increase to make up the shortfall. The northeast and two districts of the trolley car were still unable to operate last year. The west district was sealed off twice in October and December. During the seal-off period, the company's trolley cars could not return to the area.

The table below shows the comparison of trolley car mileage and passenger numbers between 1936 and last year:

Mileage

1936: 10,730,602 miles

1940: 10,605,470 miles

Passengers

112,085,248 people

149,264,657 people

In summary, the number of passengers on buses and trolley cars last year was 236,248,847.

### US Expatriates' Old Passports Required to be Submitted by Deadline

The rumor that the local US consular authorities in this port took away the old passports of US expatriates and did not issue new passports has been proven to be untrue by facts, as some expatriates have received new passports. The reason why US expatriates who submitted their old passports were unable to obtain new passports immediately is that the procedures for applying for new passports are very complicated, and it takes some time to complete them. At the same time, the US consular authorities here recently stated that the current passports will not be valid after April 10, and US expatriates are required to submit their old passports before that date.

### Donations in Lieu of Birthday Celebrations Used for Charitable Purposes; Divided Among Various Charitable Organizations

### Labor Strike at Hongxing Printing House; Appeal to All Sectors Yesterday; Typesetting Workers in Re-edition Department Go on Strike

The workers of the Hongxing Printing House at 20 Lane 406, Shanhaiguan Road, demanded improved treatment last month. After mediation, the Lead Printing Industry Association had negotiated a wage standard with the capitalists at the end of last year to maintain their livelihood. Although Hongxing was not a member of the association, it also participated. The agreement reached by both parties was originally scheduled to be implemented on February 13, but Hongxing Printing House has not complied. The workers also expressed their firm determination. A few workers were suddenly arrested a few days ago, arousing public outrage, so they went on strike. The machines and other items of the printing house were destroyed the day before yesterday, and Wu Shixin was shot on the spot by Chinese police. Workers Li Xikui and Zheng Qixiang were also arrested and interrogated by the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday, and the hearing was postponed to March 6. Currently, the Lead Printing Industry Association is appealing to all sectors to show their sympathy, and all the workers in more than 50 printing houses in Shanghai that specialize in typesetting and re-edition went on strike yesterday to show their support and demand that the authorities handle the case impartially and resolve it reasonably.

### Electricity Supply Currently Has No Problems

The Shanghai Power Company said that its coal reserves are only enough for three months. Vice President Ferris of the company said that if it is unable to obtain a continuous supply of coal in the short term, the company will not be able to continue to supply all electricity after three months. It is said that the company had previously ordered a large amount of coal from North China and India, but both places were unable to ship it to Shanghai due to a lack of ships. This issue is quite serious. According to Western newspapers, the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors convened a meeting once on the 25th of last month. At that time, they listened to the entire report of the Power Company's representatives and decided to continue the meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the problem of reducing the electricity supply to the Public Concession, which will be caused by the Power Company's inability to obtain coal. According to the Japanese-language Continental New Daily, the Power Company has requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to approve a reduction of 60% in the electricity supply. However, this statement has not been confirmed. According to Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, the reporter of the Dazhong News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors did not formally discuss this issue, so the statement that the meeting was held yesterday is not accurate, but there were indeed informal contacts between the directors. They are currently asking British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to arrange for ships.

### US Banks Will Charge Handling Fees for Foreign Currency Savings; Effective from April 1 After Notification; US Dollar Check Accounts to be Canceled Today

In view of the tense situation in the Far East and in order to curb US dollar speculation, the three US banks in this city, Citibank, Chase, and American Express, have decided to cancel US dollar check accounts from today. Citibank also stopped paying interest on foreign exchange savings from the 21st of last month. According to news obtained yesterday, the three banks suddenly took another measure and will charge handling fees for US dollar or other foreign currency savings accounts from April 1. According to a Chase Bank employee, the bank's plan is to charge one yuan per hundred yuan per year. A Citibank employee said that within a thousand yuan, one yuan will be charged per month. The detailed plan has not yet been decided. An American Express employee said that there is no news of taking this measure so far, but it may be possible in the future. It is said that the above-mentioned banks will issue a formal announcement as soon as the specific plan is decided. However, this fee will not be charged to National Currency savings accounts. As for the purpose of taking this measure, the banks said that it is to compensate the banks for the expenses incurred in maintaining deposits for customers. However, people familiar with finance said that this move is to limit foreign currency savings. Since it is difficult for the banks to obtain favorable investments for the stored foreign currencies, they must try to properly preserve them. At a time when the situation is difficult to change, it is not appropriate for both bank operations and security to maintain a large amount of foreign currency, so this decision was made.

### Last Month's Cost of Living Index Rose Again - Food Index Slightly Lower - National Currency Purchasing Power Drops to Just Over Sixteen Cents

Slight Drop in Price of No. 2 Rice

The decrease in the food category index was due to a slight recovery in rice prices this month. In the January report, it was mentioned that the rice market showed slight improvement at the end of the lunar year, but remained quiet afterward. By mid-February, prices rose again, exceeding the price limit. However, the average price per stone of No. 2粳 rice this month was slightly lower by 1.19% compared to the previous month, and No. 2 Saigon rice was also lower by 3.24%. The retail prices of other items mostly increased compared to the previous month. Tofu, dried tofu, fried tofu, and hundred-layer tofu are daily foods for Chinese people, and their prices increased significantly at the end of the month. Beef and fresh fish also increased significantly. In the middle of the month, the prices of general vegetables rose sharply due to rain and snow, but fortunately decreased after the weather cleared up. Salted snow cabbage, green vegetables, and radishes fell by 19.71%, 16.67%, and 24.24% respectively. Flour prices continued to rise, and salt and soy sauce also rose by 9.79% and 28.28% respectively. Although foreign exchange rates rose this month, except for a slight decrease in cotton, all other clothing items increased by 2.68% to 17.91%. Since October of last year, coal balls saw their first recovery, decreasing by 1.33%. In the miscellaneous category, yellow wine increased by 19.41% due to a shortage of raw materials and a large decrease in production. Sorghum also increased by 11.81%. Soap, grass paper, and matches, which are daily necessities, are becoming increasingly expensive.

### Lin Xiongji Departs Shanghai on the Tatsuta Maru for Nagasaki - Trial Not Expected to Begin Until Mid-March - Lawyer Yasui First Advocates for His Return to Japan

Lin Xiongji, the former chairman of the Japanese Residents Association in Shanghai, who shot and wounded the Chairman of the Municipal Council and the Japanese Director, among others, at the Special General Meeting of Taxpayers in the Public Concession five weeks ago, was escorted onto the Japanese ship Tatsuta Maru yesterday (the 28th) to depart Shanghai and return to Japan after a preliminary hearing by the Japanese Consular Court in Shanghai. He was granted permission to visit his ancestral graves in Osaka before facing a formal trial in Nagasaki. It is anticipated that the Nagasaki court will not commence the trial until mid-March, and the trial may be closed to the public.

Motive for Shooting is of Utmost Importance

It is reported that the Nagasaki court must determine whether Lin Xiongji intended to kill the three Municipal Council members or merely to injure them in order to determine the appropriate punishment. According to Japanese law, if Lin Xiongji only intended to injure the three individuals, he will be sentenced to imprisonment for up to three years. However, if he intended to kill them, he will face a more severe punishment. Mr. Yasui, a Japanese lawyer in Shanghai, will serve as one of Lin Xiongji's defense attorneys during the trial in Japan. It is reported that Yasui has already returned to Japan to lobby officials in connection with this case.

Arson Suspects Remain in Custody

Furthermore, regarding the case of two Japanese individuals accused of arson in Shanghai, attempting to burn down the reed shed at the Special General Meeting of Taxpayers within the racecourse, detailed information was not obtained from the Japanese authorities yesterday. According to reports, the two Japanese individuals hijacked a Tailai taxi two days before the Taxpayers' Meeting, drove into the racecourse, and threw flammable liquid onto the reed shed, causing a small fire. Fortunately, it was extinguished by Russian police officers from the Police Department. The two Japanese individuals also set fire to the rented taxi, but were unsuccessful and remain in custody.

### Adulterous Woman Sentenced to Death in Murder of Her Husband

Zhang Erguniang, an adulterous woman, 22 years old, colluded with her lover, Pang Kaibao, on the night of February 21st of the 28th year of the Republic of China. While her husband, Bao Youqing, was sound asleep, she used a sharp axe to kill Bao. They moved the body to a pond 30 yards behind their residence in a grass shed on Hangzhou Road and fled together to live illicitly in Yaoshui Lane. Later, Bao's mother-in-law, Zhang Zhou (i.e., Zhang Erguniang's biological mother), discovered the crime and reported it to the police. Pang Kaibao was apprehended and transferred to the First Special Court, where he was prosecuted for murder. After a trial, Pang was sentenced to death. His appeal to the High Court was also rejected. As for Zhang Erguniang, the court issued an arrest warrant, but Zhang cohabitated with a fellow villager, surnamed Wu, renting a house in Yaoshui Lane. On January 16th of this year, she was arrested by the Gordon Road police, transferred to the First Special Court, and detained. During the remand, Zhang gave birth to a son in the detention center, which made it inconvenient to interrogate her. The case was heard by Judge Jiang the other day. The police prosecuted her for joint murder. The defendant vehemently denied murdering her husband. Although the death row inmate Pang Kaibao was brought in to confront her, Zhang continued to be evasive. However, because the evidence was conclusive, the court announced the conclusion of the trial. Yesterday morning, she was brought to the Third Criminal Court, where Zhang Erguniang was sentenced to death for joint murder and deprived of her civil rights for life.

### Purchased Radio - Request for Return

Customer Brings Lawsuit - Yesterday's Verdict Dismissed

Shi Yingchi, a domestic radio expert, obtained a license from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and opened the Liangyou Wireless Radio Manufacturing Factory Unlimited Company on Beijing Road, producing shortwave radios that could receive broadcasts from Hong Kong and Chongqing. On July 18th of last year, a customer named Zhang Xiaotong (resident of No. 11 Chunhui Lane, Ai'erjin Road) purchased a five-tube radio from the company for 185 yuan, choosing it himself and considering it satisfactory. Two weeks later, Zhang suddenly brought the radio to the company, claiming that it could not receive Chongqing broadcasts and demanding an exchange or a refund. This led to a dispute. Zhang recently hired Chen Yanling as an agent to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting a judgment approving the return of the radio and ordering Shi Yingchi to return the payment. Based on the statement, Judge Dong Qi summoned both parties several times. The defendant hired lawyer Wu Xiangxian to attend, bringing the original radio as evidence, and firmly asserted that it could receive broadcasts from Chongqing. Judge Dong earnestly advised both parties to reconcile, but was unsuccessful. He then announced the conclusion of the debate. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Dong took the bench in the Third Civil Court and announced the verdict, the main text of which stated, "The plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed. The plaintiff shall bear the litigation costs." At the time of the verdict, the defendant Shi Yingchi's agent, lawyer Chen Xiangxian, was present to hear the verdict. It is claimed that the plaintiff's lawsuit for return of goods had other purposes. Therefore, Shi Yingchi has filed a separate lawsuit in the Criminal Court accusing Zhang Xiaotong of harming his reputation.

### Sun Wenjiang's Case - Appeal Verdict of Not Guilty

This aroused Geng Zhen's dissatisfaction, and he sued Sun in the First Special Court for embezzlement and other crimes, and Sun was sentenced to six months in prison, with a two-year suspended sentence. Sun refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyer Qian Zheng to file an appeal. After repeated reviews by the High Court, the High Court announced its verdict yesterday (the 28th) at 2:00 PM, the main text of which stated, "The portion of the original verdict regarding Sun Wenjiang's crime and sentence is revoked.

Commercial News

### Finance - Chinese Merchants Sell Foreign Exchange - Lack of Buyers

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in the HSBC listing. The black market for British and American currencies was filled with bearish sentiment, and the signing of agreements between China and the United States was enough to sway the attitudes of operators. Speculators and Japanese banks continued to sell off American dollars, but because the transactions were not large, the price easing was limited. However, foreign banks had good appetite, causing the market to soften slightly. In the afternoon session, American spot was quoted at 5.656, and March futures were quoted at 5.59375. American dollars were quoted at 5.625 and could be settled. The forward rate was relatively stable, resulting in a firmness of .05625. The current and forward rates were both quoted at 3 pence 421875. American dollars eased .125, and spot was quoted at 5.625.

Positions Were Quite Full

In the morning, banks opened with a spot selling price of 3 pence 43875 for British gold and 5.59375 yuan for American dollars, which was the same for American dollars and 0.015625 higher for British pounds compared to the previous evening's close. After the opening, banks sold shillings, and Japanese banks, including Zhengjin, absorbed spot at a price of 3 pence 421875. At 9:30 AM, the HSBC listing was announced without any changes. Afterwards, due to the consensus of bearish sentiment, the Sino-US agreement attracted the attention of operators. Chinese banks sold spot American dollars from time to time, but there was a lack of buyers, and positions were full. The price eased to 5.6525. Chinese speculators also sold March American dollars, all at 5.65625. It was not until noon that the market began to soften. The closing price for spot American dollars was still quoted at 5.625, and British pounds were quoted at 3 pence 421875.

Both British and American Currencies Saw Increased Gains

Although speculators and Japanese merchant banks continued to sell in the afternoon, prices did not continue to ease because foreign banks had a relatively strong appetite. Japanese banks offered American dollars at 5.625, and speculators also sold March American dollars at 5.625. There were no changes after that. The evening closing price for spot American dollars was 5.625, and next month was quoted at 5.59375.

### Gold Prices Hover - Spot Gold Firm and Unchanged

Yesterday, the spot gold black market prices hovered between 6,100 and 200 yuan. The news of the Sino-US agreement had penetrated the hearts of operators, and there was a reluctance to sell. However, general old speculators still temporarily bought, so the price was pulled up after falling, resulting in a hovering pattern. The lowest price in the afternoon session reached 6,120 yuan, due to higher foreign exchange rates and the sale of stock by Gonghe, Dafeng, and Defu. The afternoon close was only 6,145 yuan. The market continued to decline after opening in the afternoon, falling to as low as 6,105 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange market rebounded slightly, and Hengji, Defu, Dafeng, and securities firms absorbed the supply, pushing the price up to 6,180 yuan. Therefore, the evening close was stable at 6,169 yuan, only one yuan lower than the previous day. Spot gold continued to rise. Zhongxing sold 50 taels each to Xianghe and Defu. Chengji sold 200 taels to Xianghe, 630 yuan higher than the forward price. Tianyuan, Lianxing, Fukang, and Yonggong sold a total of 60 taels at a price 635 yuan higher, which was re-entered by Zhongxing. In the afternoon, Hesheng sold 50 taels to Xianghe, 625 yuan higher. The remaining 6,940 taels of February's outstanding balance were mostly offset by the long and short sides according to the HSBC Bank's imported American dollar rate of 5.5625 yuan, totaling 6,260.7 yuan. Overall trading was active, with over 12,000 taels traded. Jewelry gold prices remained unchanged, and customs duties were level.

In the early morning, people were watching and waiting, and there was a lack of transactions when the market opened, with no excitement. The price was 2,170 yuan, the same as the previous day's closing price. After opening, the price retreated to 6,160 yuan due to excessive supply, but retail investors continued to buy, returning the price to 6,190 yuan. Unexpectedly, the sentiment of all parties was decadent, and the negative factors remained strong due to the rising American dollar exchange rate, causing the price to be suppressed to 6,130 yuan. Later, Xin Fengyong deliberately bought in, raising the price to 6,190 yuan. Finally, Gonghe, Dafeng, Defu, Hesheng, and others sold as the price increased, so the price hovered down to 6,120 yuan. The price then recovered to 6,175 yuan. This was because Xinyuan suddenly had a buying intention, and Deda also bought in a considerable amount. However, Hesheng and others sold vigorously before closing, and the price fell to 6,140 yuan. The thousand-piece close was only 6,145 yuan. The market continued to weaken after opening in the afternoon to 6,130 yuan, and a large supply caused the price to plummet to 6,105 yuan. Later, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was slightly better, and Hengji, Chengji, Dafeng, Defu, and various securities firms successively dragged in, and the trend was upward, reaching 6,180 yuan. There was little change until closing, and the result was 6,169 yuan, one yuan smaller than the previous day's small profit. The selling price of the brand gold of the cash number was more than ten yuan higher than the spot gold (spot), and the purchase price was thirty yuan lower. The current standard gold was fifty to sixty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops has not changed from beginning to end, with large banks quoted at 6,690 yuan, and the price of new counterparts was similar to the above price, with the purchase price being thirty yuan lower.

### American Dollar Notes Backed Exchange Rate Rises

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw fluctuating spot market prices, which eventually stabilized. However, cash was popular, so British and American gold pounds each rose by one yuan. British gold notes remained stable, and market prices remained level. The American dollar notes backed exchange rate tended to rise because foreign banks had a very good appetite, so it rose to 8 jiao 3 fen in the morning. It finally reached 17 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen, an increase of one jiao compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes fell and then recovered to level. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes were in increasing demand, and market prices continued to rise. The former continued to rise to 1 yuan 7 jiao 8.5 fen, and the latter continued to rise to 1 yuan 4 jiao 6 fen.

### Silver Reserve Exchange Rate Interest

February Monthly Interest Rate of Two Li

The Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House Committee has set the interbank clearing deposit interest rate for February at 2 yuan per thousand yuan (i.e., equivalent to a monthly interest rate of two li), the same as in January.

### Grain - Three States of the Rice Market

粳 Rice Weak, Foreign Rice Tight, Glutinous Rice Stable

Yesterday's rice market presented different situations, with粳 rice being weak, foreign rice tight, and glutinous rice stable. Guomi rice had been weak the previous day due to increased sources, but sporadic arrivals were still strong yesterday. Among them, thin early rice accounted for two-thirds. However, local shops still felt the price was expensive, and their intention to buy was not strong, causing the thin early rice to be weaker and unable to hold firm. Cargo owners urgently sought to sell, with an even stronger selling intention, resulting in a large reduction of one yuan. Thin early rice was quoted at 102.5 yuan, then 101.5 yuan. Due to the scarcity of thick粳 rice, the depreciation was not significant, only falling one yuan. Kunshan Yuanbai粳 rice was quoted at 107 yuan, then 105 yuan. After glutinous rice turned weak one day, the price fell. However, most cargo owners, seeing that foreign rice continued to be tight, were unwilling to sell lightly again, and the market suddenly became scarce. However, the transit route remained sluggish, and the market lacked change. Hong Kong special round grains were still 89 yuan, and long grains were 86-7 yuan. The foreign rice held by Bin Chi felt even tighter. The only spot available was Pudong Warehouse No. 1 Saigon at 85 yuan, and Returned No. 1 Siam at 85 yuan. Broken rice and green rice were 73 yuan and 72.5 yuan respectively.

Medium and low-quality rice was the main product, with transactions not exceeding 3,000 bags. However, after the futures price rebounded once, it turned level as the continued settlement was appropriate. The new transaction involved 1,200 tons of He Yi's March broken Saigon rice at a price of 80 yuan and 9 fen, and Shen Ji's 1,500 tons at a price of 80 yuan and 3 jiao. Jianyuan Siam yuan rice 3-month 500 tons, so broken foreign rice has become flat, while foreign yuan fell 2 yuan. The bottom inventory of foreign rice, it is said, totaled 750,740 bags as of yesterday afternoon, but this is only the publicly available stock of each warehouse. The amount stored privately by large hoarders is not easy to investigate.

### Foreign Flour Gradually Easing

Flour continued to decline yesterday. After the Municipal Council distributed cheap flour for two days, the buying interest on this street sharply decreased, and floating households urgently sought to sell. It was heard that a whole batch of foreign flour would arrive at the beginning of this month, and one or two ships of foreign wheat could also arrive, so people's hearts were calm and the market was depressed. A total of more than 1,000 bags of Australian flour from Zhonglou and Huaniao brands, and 500 bags of Lanmai Hua brand were traded, with prices all at 25 yuan and 6 jiao, lower than the previous ones. With goods on the way, they must be sold after arrival, and the market is tired and lacking vitality.

The arrival and sale of wheat remain silent. On the Chinese factory side, they are waiting for the supply of foreign wheat to continue production. Japanese factories are more greedy, but ultimately there is no considerable spot available for collection. It is heard that recent negotiations to sell goods have not been successful, so the market is as silent as ever.

### Securities - Government Bonds Mostly Bought

Yesterday, the spot market for public bonds saw strong buying interest from Xinfu and Xinhua Lianhe and Defu on the 16th, especially in the afternoon. However, as it was nearing the close of the afternoon session, Xieda urgently sought to sell because it was too late, temporarily suppressing the market price, and the vigorous atmosphere was slightly reduced, but the trend was still very stable. There were fewer transactions in the morning session, with Xinfu, Shunchang, Zhihe, and Jiufeng buying, and Delong, Tongkang, XieDa, and Hengfu selling. The afternoon close was slightly firmer by one or two jiao. In the afternoon session, Xinfu had an even stronger appetite, followed by Xinhua, Defu, Yichang, and Lian. Type C opened at 66 yuan, and Runde also had a buying appetite, and the market price gradually increased. Although Delong, Tongkang, Yitai, Tongshun, Lianhe, and others sold, the market price was still fixed at 6.3 yuan. As the close approached, Xieda suddenly had a temporary transaction to sell 100,000 yuan, and Hengfu, Xiexing, Yuanxie, and Kang took advantage of the low price to absorb the supply and broke the 6 yuan price. At present, people's hearts are still inconsistent. Those who are optimistic believe that American and British aid to China is becoming stronger and more effective, and that the economic cooperation between China and the United States is no problem due to the satisfactory return of the Cooley envoy. Those who are pessimistic believe that the Sino-Japanese problem is tense, and the interest payment date is still far away. However, the multiple views are relatively sufficient. Moreover, most of the bulls are now in the financial sector and overseas Chinese, so the future is still optimistic. The market price resulted in a small increase of five fen, one jiao to two jiao. Type B was unchanged, and Type D and 96 have not yet been traded. The transaction volume was approximately 2.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified Type A 73.80 73.40 73.55 Down 0.05

Unified Type B 69.00 68.60 66.70 Flat

Unified Type C 66.35 65.60 65.60 Down 0.15

Unified Type E 64.20 63.80 63.80 Down 0.20

In stock trading, 100 shares of Chinese Electrical Stock were traded, with a price of 7 yuan and 7 jiao.

London, 27th (Thursday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and stocks of various British companies in the Far East remained flat and sluggish, with no increase or decrease in the prices.

### Silk Floss and the Silk Market's Apprehension

Current Cotton Sales Suddenly Cease

The silk market has turned sluggish, and a downward trend has begun again. This is because after the market price increased, the actual demand remains weak, and some profit-takers are selling off. As for certain parties close to the silk factories, they massively bought in on the previous day, and today they are again dumping large quantities. This indicates the uncertainty of people's minds, leading to inconsistent market fluctuations. Considering the current situation, judging by the reduction in electricity, there should naturally be an upward trend. However, there has been little actual progress. Miscellaneous brands of silk are inexpensive, and even Double Horse silk is affected. The high price for 20-count Double Horse silk was 1,391 yuan, and the low price was 1,357 yuan. In the early afternoon, trading started at 1,360 to 1,358 yuan, rising to 1,386 yuan, with a low of 1,380 yuan.

Double Horse (Morning): Continuing the sluggishness from the previous afternoon, the opening price was 1,170 yuan. However, most traders rushed to buy long positions, pushing the price up to 1,391 yuan in a short while. Then, news of stable foreign exchange and falling gold prices caused a continuous decline to 1,357 yuan. The market closed higher at 1,364 yuan. The total daytime trading volume was 7,735 bales. A breakdown of the amount purchased by each group is listed below:

Hong Kong: 175 Ningbo: 10

Traders: 7,450 Total: 7,735

Today (the 1st), 2,020 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The current situation for raw cotton remains as quiet as ever. The factory demand is weak, and the trend is flat. 184 pieces of cotton were shipped to Yantai on the 1st.

The New York cotton market is quite firm. However, due to selling by Southern brokers and profit-taking by a few long positions, the market price suddenly fell. As a result, the closing price was 4-5 points lower than the previous day.

Indian cotton did not fluctuate significantly. Yesterday, including predictions, it fell by one rupee.

Trading of imported cotton in Shanghai is stagnant, with little activity. Although the current silk situation is favorable for purchasing raw cotton, everyone is indifferent and unresponsive.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Oil Cakes Completely Controlled by Speculation

Yesterday, the oil cake market rose overall, driven by bullish sentiment and a hopeful outlook. Futures trading was only active in soybean oil, but existing cakes were absorbed by hoarders, causing the price to rise by two jiao. Although soybean oil supplies were sufficient, they were controlled by speculation, making it difficult for the market to become smaller. Yesterday, the market showed an upward trend of more than one yuan. A total of 100 barrels of spot Dalian soybean oil were traded at 119.25 yuan. 400 barrels for March delivery were ordered at 120 to 118.5 yuan, then rose to 119.5 yuan. 300 barrels for late March delivery were ordered at 119 to 119.5 yuan. 150 barrels for early April delivery were ordered at 147 to 146.5 yuan. 50 barrels of Jiangbei local mill oil were ordered at 140 yuan. 5,000 pieces of Sheng Ji brand soybean cake were offered at 74.85 to 75 yuan. 3 carts of Yuan Long brand cake were offered at 75 to 75.1 yuan. Fei Zi brand cake was offered at 74.85 to 75.1 yuan. 4-5 carts were traded. 1,160 tins of raw oil imported on the 28th arrived from Qingdao. 335 bags of soybeans and 9,330 pieces of soybean cake were all shipped to Hong Kong on March 1st.

### Silk and Tea: Raw Silk "Control" Takes Another Step

Yesterday, overseas silk markets fluctuated. The price of silk in Shanghai remained unchanged. Although foreign firms were interested in buying, trading volume was low due to a lack of inventory. Currently, most transactions, such as those for Golden Arrow, Golden Leaf, and Robison brands, are for products from the one or two remaining silk factories in Shanghai.

Also, starting today, the export licenses for raw silk used by the Shanghai Bureau of Industry and Commerce Inspection, which were previously on yellow paper, will be changed to green paper. Furthermore, all raw silk will be subject to quality inspection. This is another step towards a controlled policy. Today, 268 pieces of tea were shipped to Yantai.

### Piece Goods: Sales are Slow in Both North and South

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend turned weak. Hoarded goods were released, and selling prices generally declined. Fine cloth opened at 43 yuan in the morning, down 2.5 jiao per piece from the previous day. It continued to fall by 5 jiao in the afternoon. Transactions of Ewo coarse cloth fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. Fine twill cloth from various factories fell by 5 to 7.5 jiao per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 5 jiao. The street traded over 500 pieces of various cloths. Ningbo, Shaoxing, and Ningbo merchants traded over 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth. Guangdong and Chenghai merchants traded over 200 pieces of colored cloth and twill. Business was extremely slow for both Nanyang and Northern merchants. 2,334 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on March 1st.

Eastern Cloth: Prices first fell and then rose, but the market remained stable. White cotton Dragon Head fine cloth traded as high as 47.5 yuan, and as low as 46.85 yuan. The final price was 47.35 yuan. Colored Four Gentlemen serge fluctuated around 1.278 yuan. The closing price was 1.2775 yuan per chi.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Production Areas Report Price Increases

The origin of foreign sugar has risen. According to data, it is 10.0825 yuan in the Netherlands. A telegram from Hong Kong states 22.75 yuan. According to the guild's assessment, Taikoo Cube White rose 5 jiao to 79 yuan. B mark is 79 yuan, HX mark is 76.5 yuan. Spot Two Four Coarse White from foreign warehouses is 79 yuan. Futures rose 5 jiao. Shipments by the 10th of next month are 79.2 to 79.5 jiao. Shipments by the 20th are 79.6 to 80 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Items: Cigarettes Are Being Bought Up Again

Yesterday, the demand for cigarettes was tight, due to strong buying from hoarders, leading to another price increase. British American Tobacco cigarettes opened at 1,302 yuan, Old Knife cigarettes at 964 yuan, Five Flowers cigarettes at 686 yuan, Little Fairy cigarettes at 677 yuan, Middle box of Golden Mouse cigarettes at 465 yuan, Middle box of Beauty cigarettes at 710 yuan. There are not enough Fu Xin Pyramid cigarettes allocated by the factory to meet market demand, so prices are tight, trading at 700 yuan.

### Seafood: Western Dried Goods Inventory Dwindling

Western dried mussels are not being replenished, leading to a dwindling market inventory and continuous price increases. Yesterday, dried mussels were offered at 160 yuan, large dried mussels at 140 yuan, medium dried mussels at 225 yuan, and small dried mussels at 110 yuan. The market outlook is stable.

### Medicinal Materials: Supply of Zhaoyun is Scarce

The supply of Zhaoyun from Shantou is scarce, and the factory no longer has any stock. However, traders still have goods on hand, so the trend is very popular. It was found that the first market price was 108 yuan, and the current market price continues to rise.

### Standard of Living and Cost of Living

— Mune

What is the "Standard of Living"? What is the "Cost of Living"? The standard of living is "the totality of the quality and quantity of necessities, comforts, and conveniences habitually used by an economic entity in a certain time and space." Simply put, the standard of living is "the level of daily use of goods and services by a person or group." For example, if A, B, and C each drink one pint of milk, half a pint of milk, and half a pint of soy milk every day, respectively, then because milk is of higher quality than soy milk, and one pint is more than half a pint, their standards of living are ranked in descending order as A, B, and C. As for the cost of living, it can be said to be a concretization or monetary cost of the standard of living. Its determination is based on the monetary value of daily consumables. In other words, the cost of living is "the sum of the monetary value of the necessities, comforts, and conveniences habitually used by an economic entity in a certain time and space." Using the previous example, assuming the price of milk is one yuan per pint and the price of soy milk is five jiao per pint, then the daily living expenses of A, B, and C are one yuan, five jiao, and two jiao and five fen, respectively. Therefore, A has the highest cost of living, followed by B, and then C.

Under the same time and space, because the price of goods increases or decreases in direct proportion to the quality of goods, the amount of living expenses can also be consistent with the level of the standard of living. The only difference between them is that the standard of living is an abstract noun based on utility, while the cost of living is a concrete noun based on monetary value. However, prices vary with time and place, so the standard of living and cost of living also differ in different times and spaces. To give a simple example:

Year Total Purchase Price of Annual Rice Consumption

Republic of China Year 25 3 shi of national rice 30 yuan

Republic of China Year 29 2.5 shi of foreign rice 200 yuan

Due to the sharp rise in rice prices, the salaryman A's rice consumption changed from national rice to temporary rice, and from two rice meals and one congee meal a day to two congee meals and one rice meal. Therefore, whether in terms of the quality or quantity of rice consumed, the situation in the Republic of China year 29 was much lower than in the Republic of China year 25. In other words, A's standard of living has declined significantly compared to before. However, A's annual rice expenditure has soared from 30 yuan to 200 yuan. In other words, A's cost of living has increased by nearly six times compared to before. From the above example, we can clearly see that the cost of living not only does not necessarily keep pace with the standard of living in different times, but sometimes even goes in the opposite direction. As for different spaces, because the prices of goods of the same quality and quantity are not necessarily the same, the cost of living and the standard of living cannot be proportionally adjusted, which is even more obvious. There is no need to elaborate here.

In short, because prices and currency values are not fixed, an increase in the cost of living in different times and spaces does not necessarily indicate a higher standard of living. Under the current circumstances, although the cost of living for the general population has increased sharply compared to before the war, prices have risen even more, so the standard of living of the masses has not only not increased, but is in a dire state. Therefore, shouting about a high standard of living today is a misuse of the term, because in fact the lives of the general population after the war are much more difficult than before the war!

### China Statistics Society Holds 10th Annual Meeting: Remarkable Achievements in the Past Ten Years

(Chongqing Airmail) The 10th Annual Meeting of the China Statistics Society was held at 9:00 AM on February 15 at Qiujing Middle School. Attendees included Zhu Jiahua, President of the Academia Sinica, Chen Qicai, Comptroller-General of the National Government, and more than 100 members including He Lian, Zhu Junyi, Zhang Xiaomei, Wang Zhongwu, Guan Yifei, Huang Zhong, Fang Xianting, Li Deyin, and Huang Houduan. Zheng Yaozi, Chairman of the Annual Meeting Preparatory Committee, presided over the meeting and reported on the preparations for the annual meeting. Then, Vice President Zhu Junyi reported on the achievements of the society in the past ten years, which mainly included more than 100 papers from the ten annual meetings, and the published Journal of Statistics and Statistical Series. The theme of this year's discussion was statistics and price control and statistics and food management. Next, President Zhu gave a speech, raising two points of thought: (1) In the past ten years, China's statistical undertakings have become increasingly developed and institutions have expanded. However, due to the poor national foundation and the low level of the people, it is quite difficult to manage. In the future, our statistical work should not be too high, and we should start with the basic conditions first. (2) The topic of this annual meeting is the most important issue at present. I hope that everyone will focus on the institutions, improve efficiency, and study the methods that are most suitable for the times. Next, Comptroller-General Chen gave a speech, pointing out that it is not easy to promote statistical administration in our country because administrative officials at all levels have not fully recognized the importance of statistics, so that China still does not have accurate statistics on population and land. This is not the fault of academic researchers. In the future, I hope that leaders at all levels, both centrally and locally, will attach importance to statistics and raise public awareness. At the same time, cultivate statistical talents. I admire the gentlemen of your society for engaging in statistical academic research. The National Comptroller Conference will open on February 20, and I hope that you will be able to contribute your research findings to the conference for reference. Finally, Chairman Zheng gave a reply. The thematic discussion and official reading of papers began at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, presided over by Wang Zhongwu, Chairman of the Paper Committee. The papers included Fang Xianting's "Agricultural Information Reporting and Food Management," Zhang Xiaomei's "General Review of Price Control in Our Country," Luo Ru's "Economic Construction and Price Hikes," Chen Zhengmo's "Statistics and Price Control," Chu Yifei's "Wartime Price Issues," Zou Yiren's "Application of Once Delayed Analysis to the Study of Price Changes," Yu Shourong's "Preliminary Proposal for Compiling a Wartime National Wholesale Price Index," Zheng Yaozi's "The Three-Link System of Statistics and Administration," Li Fan's "Promoting Statistical Undertakings and Statistical Legislation in Our Country," and Wang Zhongwu's "Review and Countermeasures of Wartime Price Issues in Our Country." After the papers were read, the members raised opinions and discussed them in detail. The meeting did not end until 6:00 PM. The discussion continued from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 16th, and a social affairs meeting was held in the afternoon.

### Profession: Meeting an Old Friend in a Strange Land

— Luoying

One sunny Sunday afternoon, I was walking alone on the street, trying to dispel the worries in my chest. The breeze blowing on my body did bring a hint of spring. I felt excited and had an inexplicable feeling on my face.

Suddenly, a young man I seemed to recognize came towards me. When my eyes flashed across his face, he suddenly showed a look of fear, trying to avoid me. But I wasn't afraid to be presumptuous, so I walked over, patted him on the shoulder, and said very politely,

"Brother Huimin! It's been a long time!"

"Ah...ah...Brother ××! How are you?" He said, nodding his head, but seemed very embarrassed.

Since we were meeting an old friend in a strange land, I had to ask where he was now.

"Sigh!" He sighed softly: "To tell you the truth, brother, I am now unemployed, and I have been unemployed for more than a year. Although I have asked people everywhere to help me, it is still like a stone sinking into the sea. I really..." His head was down, and he seemed to have unspeakable pain.

He was my elementary school classmate, and it had been many years since we last saw each other. He had a long, thin face and loved to talk. After we parted ways, I heard that he had gone to Shanghai to learn business, and that he had entered a silk shop. We had never corresponded once since then, and I had almost forgotten him. Today's chance encounter was something I never dreamed of.

We turned a corner, and a warm wind blew in. I asked him about his address with concern.

"I'm temporarily staying at a distant relative's house, but they are also very poor. I'm too embarrassed to just sit and eat at their house, so..." He paused and finally plucked up the courage to continue: "I have now become an apprentice to a master, and I will have to brazenly bum a meal from him tonight. I..."

"A master? Who?" Before he finished speaking, I quickly asked him. But he laughed. Finally, he said to me seriously: "I'll tell you, it's the fortuneteller on ×× Road."

"Oh!" I began to be surprised, but my sympathy finally outweighed my suspicion. "Huichi! You seem to be..."

"I don't want to fall, but I really have no choice. I will definitely find another way in the future. Now I have to grit my teeth and work hard." He defended himself anxiously as he spoke.

Everyone was silent for a while. He asked me for a mailing address and said: "Come over and talk to me when you have time."

At the crossroads, we parted ways. I said to him with concern: "I wish you all the best and hope you can find a more suitable position soon." His tears were about to fall, and he choked out three words: "Thank you!"

I watched him walk away with heavy steps. The warm wind lifted the corners of his clothes.

Psychology

### The Advantages of Being Left-Handed

— Lan Yu

I recall reading several articles about left-handed people in magazines before, from which I gained much practical knowledge. For example, if I have a son in the future and discover that he prefers using his left hand to eat sweets or play with toys after the age of two or three, I will never force him to learn to use his right hand like most people, which could dull his vision or hearing, or even cause him to stutter.

Recently, while flipping through old magazines at home, I came across another short article about left-handed people that was quite interesting. I and a left-handed person conducted an experiment at the Zhejiang University sports field, using a football to kick at a pole, and we found that the statements made in the article were indeed true. Now, I will translate it as follows:

"If you are left-handed, you have no reason to say that this is a disadvantage. On the contrary, you actually have an advantage over most right-handed people. According to recent scientific research, left-handed people are the only ones who can walk in a straight line. It has now been discovered that no right-handed person can walk five hundred yards straight towards a prominent target without needing any markings. Right-handed people tend to veer to the left severely, and their path forms an arc with the apex on the left side.

If there are no stars or other landmarks, and you tell a right-handed person to 'walk straight ahead' in the desert, after a full twenty-four hours, they will definitely return to their starting point. This is why people who get lost in the desert often suddenly find themselves back in places they had already been to several days before. Science has not yet been able to explain this fact, which may be due to a characteristic of our nervous system that has not yet been considered. Only one type of person can walk straight, and that is a left-handed person.

An infantry commander said that when marching in unfamiliar places at night, if there were left-handed people, he would always have them walk on the left side of the column, so that he could be confident that the direction was straight and unbiased.

Now that England and Italy are fighting fiercely in East Africa, I remember that among the British soldiers stationed in Shanghai before, there was one nicknamed 'Yellow Hair' who was very good at playing football, especially good at kicking with his left foot. I wonder if his hand is also more skillful with the left than the right? If so, if he goes to the African desert, he should always walk on the left side of the column!"

### Occupational Diseases

— Zhi Hui

Dr. Sha Xia Si, a medical doctor at the University of Oregon in the United States, published an interesting report. According to his investigation of two hundred male patients suffering from a rare form of breast cancer (in 1938, a total of 14,315 women in the United States died from breast cancer, compared to only 145 men), he found that many of them were carpenters and shoemakers. This is because they often hold tools or other workpieces tightly against their chests while working. In addition, postal workers are also prone to this disease because their chests are often compressed by the bags they carry.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(4) An Unexpected Encounter

Qiu Haitang kept wringing her hands, her mind in such a turmoil that she couldn't think straight.

"I also heard from the people in the accounting room that Shen Mazi has connections with the police局. Even if his injury can be healed, Zhao Lao Er will have to face several years of legal trouble..." Zhao Si said with his copper-bell eyes wide open.

When people are in distress, the first savior they can think of is always the person they respect or trust the most. Therefore, Qiu Haitang immediately thought of Yuan Shaowen.

"I wonder if Seventh Master has returned yet?"

Zhao Si didn't answer immediately. He looked up with his fat face and pondered for three or four minutes. Suddenly, he slapped his hand on his right thigh, and a hint of a smile appeared on his weary face.

"Seventh Master may not have returned to Beijing yet, but Third Master might be on his way!"

"What? Third Master?" Qiu Haitang asked blankly.

"That's right, Yuan the Garrison Commander!" Zhao Si said, as if very proud. "You probably don't know about this yet! Let me tell you! Third Master also has a residence in Tianjin."

Qiu Haitang would not be surprised even if Zhao Si said that Yuan the Garrison Commander, such a extravagant and lecherous warlord, had residences in every major city in China.

"But if he is really on his way, why haven't we seen him once in the past ten days or so?" This was what Qiu Haitang couldn't understand.

But Zhao Si couldn't answer either, only replying vaguely:

"That's why I said he might be!"

"Then what's the use?"

"But we might as well work separately," Zhao Si said, looking very capable. "You go ahead and send a telegram to find Seventh Master, and I'll go back and inquire about Second Master's residence. If we get lucky and happen to find him, wouldn't we have a savior?"

Hearing him say this, Qiu Haitang felt slightly relieved.

"Looks like we won't be able to sleep tonight!" Zhao Si stood up, looked at the sunlight just peeking through the window, and yawned. (43)

New Film Introduction

### "Tin Pan Alley"

— Cheng Bingnu

The so-called "Tin Pan Alley" is the birthplace of American musicians in New York, although many of them died old and unrecognized. This film tells the story of the romance between two sheet music publishers, Han Pan En and Jake O'Kay, and a pair of singers, Alice Faye and Betty Grable. Although the story itself is nothing more than a romance between men and women, this romance is quite touching, and young audiences cannot help but be moved by it. Alice Faye, angry that Han valued songs more than his love for her, leaves for London. Han loses Alice Faye, and no one asks about his songs. Destitute, he enlists as a soldier with Jack when World War I breaks out. Later, they arrive in London and meet Alice Faye, but she already has a fiancé. Han has no choice but to leave dejectedly. However, Alice Faye cannot let go of her old feelings and tries her best to rush to the pier to see him off. The two are reluctant to part, and Alice Faye finally says to him: "I'll wait for you," until John returns triumphantly, and Alice Faye welcomes him by singing his song. This "Tin Pan Alley" ends in a melodious sound.

This story is naturally more moving than the similar "The Dolly Sisters." The inserts in "The Dolly Sisters" can also be found here. For example, the "Arabian Nights" performed by Alice Faye and Betty Grable in a London theater is as gorgeous and luxurious as possible. The tap-dancing duo in "The Dolly Sisters" also shows off their skills here, dancing with novelty and vigor. Naturally, these are exciting and stimulating, especially when Alice Faye and Betty Grable appear half-naked, singing and dancing, they are even more beautiful.

But in my opinion, the most wonderful part of the whole film is the farewell scene at the pier. Alice Faye and Han meet again after a long separation, and the two cannot help but embrace each other warmly. Then, they look into each other's eyes, and the thoughts in their hearts are conveyed through their eyes. Alice Faye and Han's inner performances are both profound, and their expressions of wanting to speak but hesitating, and being reluctant to part, are really too touching.

Although Betty Grable does not have many scenes, she gives the audience a deep impression. When she appears on stage with Alice Faye, she is more moving than Alice Faye in the dance. John Payne's acting is very steady; Jack Oakie is very brilliant and is the best supporting actor in the whole film. Although the director does not have any particularly outstanding points, the tone of the whole film is light, brisk, and concise, without a moment of slackness or dullness.

### Silver Screen Beauty Famine

— Tu Tu

Many authoritative producers in Hollywood Studios feel that the lack of pure and beautiful actresses has become a very troubling problem. Although various film companies have searched for many beautiful and moving women, making Hollywood a concentration of beauties, it is still difficult to find those who emphasize pure beauty, causing great panic.

When MGM's beauty recruiters were looking for forty-four pure and beautiful women to fill the "Ziegfeld Girl" standard, they also felt that pure beauty was hard to find. More than five hundred enthusiastic female applicants requested a review, but only forty-five were selected. However, these selected ones were only preliminarily qualified to be filmed, and most of them will have to be eliminated in the final selection. From this, it can be seen the strictness and prudence of the Hollywood producers in selecting materials.

The female standards jointly set by producer Pandro Berman and famous director Robert Leonard are: a height of five feet and seven inches, and those who are too tall or too short are excluded. Just the height alone has such harsh regulations, and other conditions are even stricter. Crowds of young women want to enter the embrace of Hollywood, but are rejected outside the silver door. Hollywood has its own compelling reasons.

The "China" cartoon "Wang Laowu Goes to War" has already been completed, and a new cartoon, "Little Hunter," is currently being produced. The content depicts a child disguising himself as a hunter to conduct reconnaissance and guerrilla work, and is both serious and humorous in nature, with profound significance.

Preface

When talking about the historical traces of governance, chaos, rise, and fall, there are often one or two women embellishing them, such as Xi Shi by the Gusu Terrace and Yang Guifei in the Huaqing Palace. Therefore, the general Confucian scholars' rigid theories often severely criticize beauties as the source of disaster, as if female beauty is enough to destroy a country; even regarding beautiful women with red makeup and green eyebrows as floods and scorpions. Isn't this a great misfortune for the women's world? In fact, in the past era of male dominance, the key to the survival, peace, and danger of the country was in the hands of men. With the emperor's supreme status and under the autocratic and licentious power, what could he not obtain? However, he happened to encounter a romantic prince who loved beauty more than the country, indulged in sensual pleasures, forgot his position, and neglected the affairs of the court, which allowed foreign enemies and internal troubles to rise. Except for Xi Shi, who was presented by the King of Yue, it should be discussed separately. Others, whose own fate was also held in the hands of others, how could they know anything about the rise and fall of the country? Moreover, there are women who are deeply concerned and care about national affairs, but unfortunately, their words carry little weight and are of no help to the times. For example, the poem by Lady Huarui of the Shu Kingdom, "The king raises the flag of surrender on the city wall, how can a concubine in the deep palace know? One hundred and forty thousand people lay down their armor, not a single one is a man." How poignant are these words! Alas! It is unfortunate for beauties to be born in troubled times and encounter extraordinary events. What is performed is often something they cannot know or want, but people lightly shift the blame for the destruction of the country onto women. Frankly speaking, who can be without feelings when faced with the faces of hibiscus-like beauties and the dances of willow-like slender beauties? Kings love beauty, scholars love beauty, and those who hold imperial pens and command troops also love beauty. But if one can be like Mencius said, "If the king loves beauty, share it with the people, what is there to object to?" And in the two hundred poems of the Book of Songs, Guan Ju sings of the graceful lady, who can be sought day and night. This is not the author defending women. On the contrary, there are many examples in history that can be pointed to, such as Nie Yinniang and Hong Qian, Liang Yu and Yun Ying. The city of women is impregnable, and the women's army is invincible. Moreover, there are some unnamed heroines. When the Central Plains were in turmoil and foreign enemies invaded, many scholars often cowered under the blade, losing their masculine spirit, losing their integrity in the face of difficulty, and shamelessly serving the enemy. How can fathers blame their daughters? And the tragedy of leading wolves into the house was staged because of the military commanders' foolishness and selfishness. How could this disaster be what the lady herself wished for? Moreover, the lotus seed is bitter, with hidden intentions. The infatuation and fervor in their hearts are no less than those of the heroes who sacrificed their lives for righteousness. By Shanhaiguan, only stains remain; by Kunming Lake, there are still traces of beauty. However, within these stains of humiliation and traces of beauty, there are many chaste and ardent jewels, struggling and running in the light of swords and the rain of blood, trying to bloom brilliantly with the flowers of revival. If things do not succeed, it is fate. Heroes cannot be judged by success or failure, how can the writer remain silent? To render and connect them, to write them out one by one, for modern people to read quickly, I am afraid it is not only for entertainment during wine parties and tea breaks.
