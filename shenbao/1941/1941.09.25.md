### Uneven Living Conditions of Civil Servants, Executive Yuan Plans Adjustments, Unequal Treatment Promotes Personnel Turnover, Committee Will Be Established to Plan Adjustment Measures

Chongqing – During wartime, the living conditions of civil servants vary greatly. For example, government agencies mostly provide only a small subsidy in addition to subsidized rice, bringing the total to 100 yuan. However, some state-owned enterprises provide several times this amount, causing resentment in some quarters and promoting personnel turnover. The Executive Yuan therefore plans to establish a Wartime Civil Servant Living Improvement Committee to make adjustments. Whether subsidized rice should be abolished and replaced with a rice subsidy in order to simplify procedures and reduce corruption will also be decided. In the Supreme National Defense Council, there is another proposal to abolish subsidized rice and small subsidies, and to provide all civil servants, regardless of their nature, with a wartime subsidy of 250 yuan, but this has not yet been submitted for discussion.

If collection is unsuccessful, a portion of the land will be auctioned off. According to authorities' estimates, there will be good harvests in all areas this year, and the tax amount averages less than one-tenth of the harvest, so grain households can pay enthusiastically. The problems that need to be solved at present are storage and transportation. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

### No Clues in Search for Mrs. Clark

Beiping – Since the Japanese wife of British Intelligence Counselor Clark went missing on Saturday, there have been no clues today.

Editorial

### Sino-Japanese Situation and the Battle of Northern Hunan

Since the end of the Battle of Wuhan, Japan seems to have lost faith in using force as the only solution to the Sino-Japanese problem. The battles on the battlefield rarely have decisive advances or retreats, so in the minds of some people, their attention to the war has invisibly faded with the passage of time, and problems such as the progress and retreat of the European War and the relationship between the United States and Japan have replaced this position. In today's China, it is true that the close connection and influence between various factors cannot be denied, not to mention that the Sino-Japanese problem is an important part of it; however, changes in the international community can affect the future of events in the Far East. China's progress and retreat are also sufficient to influence world trends; this is the most valuable harvest of the past four years. Today's situation absolutely cannot be measured with the old perspective of the past. The war between China and Japan is a matter of life and death for both countries, but it is also a matter of safety and security for the international situation. China's combat has been praised and assisted by the world, and President Roosevelt even praised it as the great national defense of the United States. In addition to the recognition based on justice, it should be understood from this connection.

Because Japan is short of strength in the Sino-Japanese problem, it has always emphasized methods other than military ones in the past three or four years. Its year-round talk of southward advance is certainly to satisfy its desire for expansion, but on the other hand, it is also a step in "solving the Sino-Japanese incident." In the minds of some Japanese people, they seem to have never deeply realized the internal national power of China, and always regard China's combat as the credit of friendly assistance, so they have the view that if the relationship between Britain and the United States can be resolved, the war against China will naturally be resolved. From the anti-British movement in the previous year to the recent negotiations with the United States, many of them started from this understanding. However, no friendly country will force China to succumb, and China's firm position cannot be shaken by any international fluctuations; in the past few years, there has been the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in Tokyo, and there has been the blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Yunnan-Burma Railway. Those difficult adversities have failed to shake China's firm will in the slightest. This situation may be seen more clearly by third countries than by Japan. Therefore, if Japan's main intention in conducting US-Japan negotiations is to hope that the "Sino-Japanese Incident" can be resolved through the mediation of the United States, then it is not surprising that these negotiations have no result. The Tokyo military department's brazen statement that "it is determined to carry out the war against China to the end no matter what the opposition" is a revelation of the inner workings of the Japanese authorities and a vent of frustration after the failure of diplomatic use with the United States. The call for southward advance was once used to help the poverty of the war against China, and after hitting a wall in the southward advance. They will inevitably try again for military adventures in China, even if that may not really reap any results. At least it can be used to show off to the international community, indicating that Japan still has the strength to threaten China. If they can fortunately succeed, that will naturally be a major harvest in the years of stalemate. This is probably the reason for its large-scale invasion in northern Hunan this time.

According to the custom of the past four years, every time the autumn wind is strong, Japan often takes action in northern Hunan: After the fall of Wuhan in the 27th year, the Japanese army once advanced to the vicinity of Changsha. Relying on the effective combat of the Chinese army, the situation was turned from danger to safety. In the autumn of the 28th year, the Japanese gathered nearly 200,000 main troops and violently attacked from northern Hunan in multiple routes, but the result was a great victory for the Chinese army. Only last year, because Japan was intent on advancing south and disturbing China's southeastern coast, there was no large-scale invasion in northern Hunan, but small contacts occurred constantly, and the Chinese and Japanese armies have always been separated by the Xinqiang River for three years. Judging from the terrain of northern Hunan, the terrain on both sides of the railway and highway from Yuezhou to Changsha is flat and there is no danger to defend. On the other hand, the waterway of the Xiangjiang River and Dongting Lake has formed the most convenient route for the Japanese army to act from Yuezhou to Changsha. This easy-to-attack and difficult-to-defend terrain is suitable for Japan's current standard of avoiding the important and taking the light. If Changsha is not defended, then Hengyang will also be in danger, and thus the hub of north-south traffic in southern China will also be seriously threatened. This certainly has no decisive significance in resolving the Sino-Japanese war, but Japan may achieve many gains at a lower cost. This battle was launched on the 7th of this month at Dayun Mountain between Linxiang and Yuezhou, and turned into a frontal contact south of the Xinqiang River on the 18th. After the 20th, the Japanese army was blocked on both sides of the Miluo River. In the tragic fighting, the Chinese army won a major victory, but the Japanese army once again used the old strategy of extending the wings and encircling. On one side, hundreds of ships invaded Yingtan Xiangyin on the south bank of Dongting Lake, and on the other side, they advanced east along the Miluo River, attempting to attack Pingjiang. The troops mobilized by the Japanese army this time are only half of those in the northern Hunan battle of the previous year, and they were still drawn from various battlefields. Strategically, there is no novel use or deployment, then with the sharp and expanding Chinese army, it should be able to achieve the effect of ease, but this battle has great significance for all parties inside and outside, and the Chinese army's interception and response should not be negligent in the slightest.

Although Japan no longer has the strength and determination to solve the Sino-Japanese incident by force, military victory is still the only way for China to complete its combat goals. Only in this way can it give full play to China's great contribution to international justice and future peace, and it is also what all anti-aggression countries and people expect from China. In the international community, even if there is still some haze, China's major achievements in the military will surely be enough to eliminate it invisibly.

### President Roosevelt Announces US Prepares to Arm Merchant Ships; Will Request Congress to Amend Neutrality Act; Attaches Great Importance to the Pink Star Incident

United Press International, Washington, 24th - President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the United States may move towards arming merchant ships. The President also mentioned that the Panamanian-registered American ship "Pink Star," which recently sank near Iceland, was equipped with a self-defense gun. However, the President declined to say how many Panamanian-registered ships were so equipped. The President has clearly indicated that he will ask Congress to amend or even repeal the Neutrality Act so that American ships flying the American flag can be armed. He stated that a decision would be made next week, and that the United States may arm American merchant ships on one hand, and arm ships of other American republics on the other. He also said that the United States would do its best to protect these captains. The "Pink Star" incident is just another clear proof of illegal warfare, and that the world is currently facing an unprecedented disaster in history, with some groups attempting to rule the world. The President also stated that the "Pink Star" sank at 11:25 PM on Friday. The ship was being protected by a Canadian convoy when it was attacked by a submarine 275 miles northeast of Cape Race. President Roosevelt recalled that in 1917, the Senate obstructed the arming of merchant ships, but President Wilson at the time believed he had the power to do so and proceeded accordingly. President Roosevelt stated that he has virtually completed investigating the details of the American ship's attack on the high seas, and that the main goal now is to defend the New World and defeat the countries that are trying to rule the world.

United Press International, Washington, 24th - President Roosevelt's remarks about the United States moving towards arming American merchant ships were met with opposition from "isolationists" in Congress yesterday. Democratic Senator Clark of Illinois said, "If President Roosevelt attempts to advance this matter through legislative procedures, he will encounter the most difficult debate in Congress." Republican Senator Tobey of New Hampshire said, "Arming merchant ships is another step into war." The Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee stated that he was prepared to assist President Roosevelt in implementing this through legislative procedures after learning the details.

United Press International, Washington, 24th - Reliable sources revealed today that many of the 125 American merchant ships flying the Panamanian flag are already equipped with weapons, and the United States plans to install cannons on the remaining ships. This can be done without changing the Neutrality Act. Forty-five of these ships are owned by the US government. It is understood that the Army Department's special rapid-firing five-inch dual-purpose guns are intended to make air defense one of the most sophisticated aspects of national defense. The structure of this dual-purpose gun can be used to deal with pirate ships and bombers. During the last World War, American armed merchant ships only used three-inch guns.

United Press International, Washington, 24th - Secretary of State Hull, when discussing the sinking of the "Pink Star" at a press conference yesterday, expressed confidence in the ability of the US Navy to deal with Axis pirate ships. Hull stated that he would prefer the Navy Department itself to discuss the actions taken in response to this particular incident. Hull stated that the State Department is currently collecting all possible information about the sinking of the ship.

United Press International, Washington, 24th - The State Department stated yesterday that 23 survivors from the American freighter "Pink Star," which sank near Iceland on Friday, have arrived in Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. The State Department stated that details about the other 11 sailors have not yet been received.

The Public Opinion of Thirty-Seven US States Urges the Government to Declare War on Germany

Reuters, New York, 24th - The "New York Times" has been strenuously demanding the repeal of the Neutrality Act since the sinking of the American ship "Pink Star," stating that if the Nazi government claims that the ship was sunk by a German submarine, it is in accordance with the laws of war. If the United States acquiesces to this, it will succumb to Germany's control of the sea. We believe we have every right to protect our commerce at sea. Germany's blockade has no basis in international law. To make our policy effective, we should arm our merchant ships. This will require the repeal of the Neutrality Act. This step should have been taken long ago. It should be known that Americans are currently not neutral in this war and have never known it. Today, the "New York Times" featured a full-page advertisement urging the United States to immediately declare war on Germany. The cost of this advertisement was borne by the American people of thirty-seven states.

Germany Openly Provokes the US; Maritime War Is Difficult to Avoid

Reuters, Washington, 24th - After the US President issued a statement that submarines would be shot on sight, the American ship "Pink Star" was sunk by a submarine in Icelandic waters. Is this an open provocation, or is it due to negligence? Observers cannot say for sure at this time. The lack of details has led to much speculation. Some members of Congress previously believed that Axis pirate ships had received instructions to stay away from the American defense line to avoid conflict with American warships, which could lead to an explosive situation. Therefore, there was no news of incidents within the maritime defense line. But the sinking of the "Pink Star" has now broken this theory. Will the unlimited war within the maritime defense line begin with this?

International News Service, Washington, 24th - Since the sinking of the American freighter "Pink Star," the US Atlantic Fleet has cleared its decks and prepared for battle. It is widely believed that these ships are currently in the North Atlantic, searching for submarines. President Roosevelt recently declared that any Axis submarine or surface pirate ship found in the US maritime defense zone would be attacked. Officials believe that the recent sinking of the "Pink Star" is a direct challenge to President Roosevelt's recent announcement. It is believed here that Germany not only does not want to withdraw its warships from the US maritime defense zone, but also wants to risk conflict with the US Navy in order to prove that attacking ships in the blockade zone announced by Berlin is a legitimate act.

Berlin Remains Silent; Italian Media Warns the US

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 24th - A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said last night that they have not yet received news from the German side about the sinking of the "Pink Star," which was flying the Panamanian flag.

International News Service, Berlin, 24th - Today, the German side refused to acknowledge or deny responsibility for the sinking of the "Red Star," but insisted that this action was "in accordance with international war regulations." They also added that the US is "fully aware of our blockade zone."

International News Service, Rome, 24th - Mussolini's spokesman, Gayda, wrote in the "Italian Daily" today, warning that Axis ships would not hesitate to attack American ships attempting to reach England. Gayda declared that if American ships enter the blockade zone announced by the Axis powers, Italian torpedo boats will not hesitate to attack them. These are the same torpedo boats that were used to sink ships in the inner harbor of Gibraltar.

### US Navy Secretary Knox Strongly Advocates Repealing the Neutrality Act; Another Giant New Battleship Is Launched

Reuters, Quincy, Massachusetts, 24th - The US 35,000-ton new battleship "Massachusetts" (note: this is the fourth of the six new battleships with which the United States is strengthening its two-ocean navy) was launched yesterday morning, attracting tens of thousands of spectators. Navy Secretary Knox came to attend the ceremony and delivered a speech, stating that the Neutrality Act hinders the efforts of the United States and should be repealed immediately. Those who are dedicated to keeping the war away from the American coast should not be hindered in any way. We must repeal this act in a timely manner. If American security is to be maintained, the United States must rely on maintaining naval power for many years to come. Transporting the necessary aid anytime, anywhere is a necessity. Our work is to keep the war away from the Americas. Let us not tie the hands of President Roosevelt. The battleship that has just been launched may have to participate in the Second World War for human freedom. The "Massachusetts" and other warships that have recently been launched and are still under construction will be equipped with the largest heavy guns and participate in the navy's task of clearing the sea lanes between the United Kingdom and the United States. Knox also stated that recent events on the Soviet front have slightly dimmed the prospects for victory. The number of casualties on the Soviet battlefield is greater than in any battle in history. The war on the Soviet front is directly related to our own situation. After the "Massachusetts" was launched, the new destroyer "Firestone" was placed on the keel where the "Massachusetts" had been in order to begin construction.

### On the Ukrainian Front, German Forces Continue to Advance Eastward; Red Army Counterattack in the Central Sector Is Victorious; German Aircraft Raid on Moscow Fails

TASS, Moscow, 24th - The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report for the night of the 23rd, stating that during the day, our army continued to fight the enemy along the entire front. On the 21st, 53 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 28 of which were shot down in aerial combat and 25 of which were destroyed at the airfield. We lost 16 aircraft.

TASS, Moscow, 24th - The Red Army in the central sector achieved another victory yesterday. After four days of fighting, the Red Army led by Maslennikov inflicted a major blow on the enemy's 102nd Division, 233rd, and 235th Regiments, and forced the enemy to retreat to the opposite bank of the Dvina River. The enemy left behind 2,500 bodies. Our army also seized many spoils of war.

International News Service, Berlin, 24th - The official German news agency here announced today that the German Air Force has achieved a major victory, sinking a Soviet battleship in the Baltic Sea, and launching a fierce attack on the industrial center of Kharkov in Ukraine. At the same time, it also stated that since the German army occupied Kiev after the final battle, 750,000 Soviet troops have been eliminated by the German army in the pocket-shaped area east of Kiev. German forces are still continuing to advance towards Kharkov and Rostov. The Nazi bulletin acknowledged for the first time today that Soviet forces have launched counterattacks on the southern and central fronts, but claimed that each Red Army counterattack has been repulsed and suffered heavy losses.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th - The city of Kharkov in Ukraine is currently the target of the German offensive. The city is comparable in size to Kiev, with a population of 840,000. Kharkov is an important transportation hub. Railways from various ports on the Black Sea pass through the city to Moscow. The city is also an important industrial center.

Reuters, London, 24th - A Soviet news agency reported that in a certain area of the Leningrad front, Soviet troops broke through the fire net of heavy artillery, mortars, and automatic weapons, and launched a bayonet attack on a bridge. German troops could not resist and retreated seven miles. Yesterday, a semi-official German statement acknowledged that the Soviet offensive in the central sector was very fierce, but claimed that it would be a major mistake to say that the Soviet offensive had succeeded. The Soviet offensive east of Smolensk had been broken by German artillery fire. The losses of Soviet soldiers and equipment were exceptionally heavy. Many Soviet units lost more than two-thirds of their strength in front of the German lines, and those who followed and charged into the German artillery fire over corpses were also repulsed.

Reuters, London, 24th - An Air Ministry spokesman said that British fighter planes have been fighting the German Air Force in Soviet territory.

Reuters, Moscow, 24th - Last night, a group of German aircraft attempted to raid Moscow, but were dispersed by anti-aircraft fire and fighter planes. Only two managed to penetrate the city's airspace, dropping a small number of high-explosive bombs and incendiaries, causing minor damage.

German Forces Prepare for Winter Trench Warfare Along a Vast Front

Reuters, Central Front, Soviet Union, 24th - The representative of the Soviet Army Headquarters on the Central Front, Major General Sokolovsky, recently told reporters that German forces are clearly digging trenches along a front stretching from over a hundred miles to over a thousand miles, adopting a defensive posture. Winter is coming, and when the ground is muddy, there will be trench warfare. The German reserves have not yet been exhausted, but they are close to exhaustion. In winter warfare, German forces will greatly lose their mobility. The German army has now begun to use horses instead of motor vehicles. Roads everywhere are becoming difficult to travel, and the German army is undoubtedly suffering from a severe oil shortage. The severe cold of winter will become a new problem for the German army. The Soviet army has sheepskin coats and snow boots for warmth. As demonstrated in the Finnish War, Soviet soldiers can stay outdoors day and night at fifty degrees below freezing when necessary, while German soldiers cannot withstand this cold.

The Nazi Army Suffered Heavy Losses in the Failed Attempt to Invade Moscow

The Major General described the reasons for the failure of the German army's attempt to break through the Smolensk area and invade Moscow, stating that since the German army began its invasion of Smolensk, it has lost 1,950 aircraft in this area alone. As a result of the Soviet counteroffensive starting in early September, a large area of land stretching 60 miles in length and 6 miles to 30 miles in depth has been reclaimed along the front line. Ten German divisions were completely destroyed or partially annihilated. The enemy has recently had to redeploy ten divisions to reinforce them. These troops were transferred from other parts of the front line, but there is no evidence that they were transferred from the Leningrad area. The Soviet army is currently about 25 miles from Smolensk. He then emphasized that the Soviet artillery is far superior in quality. When the Soviet artillery controls the battlefield, the chaos and inaccuracy of the German artillery fire are surprising. Tens of thousands of German vehicles have been lost in this area, mostly due to the artillery. At present, the Soviet Air Force also maintains superiority on this front, and enemy aircraft have avoided engaging Soviet aircraft. A major factor in the failure of the German army on the Smolensk front is that its rear areas have been weakened by the activities of guerrillas and the hostility of the local population, as it has had to transfer a large number of troops from the front to take care of the rear. Currently, only the main roads from Minsk to Smolensk are under German control. German soldiers dare not venture off the roads unless they form large groups. Guerrillas constantly attack German convoys and transport teams. The failure of the German army's invasion of Moscow has forced Hitler to transfer his central army to Leningrad and Ukraine. According to the information received, the German army will encounter the same difficulties in Leningrad and Ukraine and ultimately fail, as it did in Smolensk.

In the Battle of the Lake Ilmen Area, German Casualties Reached 50,000

United Press International, Moscow, 24th - The Red Star reported yesterday that three teams of the Red Army in the Lake Ilmen area launched a counterattack in a certain area, which is the opposite of what the Germans claimed about being surrounded. The Red Star claimed that the German army suffered 50,000 casualties in the Battle of Lake Ilmen. It also claimed that the German 56th Regiment and eight tank teams were destroyed. The Red Star also acknowledged that the Soviet army suffered a total of 30,000 casualties.

United Press International, Moscow, 24th - Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky stated that the number of casualties on both sides in the Battle of Leningrad was extremely alarming. Lozovsky mocked the German statistics on the number of officer and soldier casualties. He estimated that the German losses were about 2.3 million, based on estimates from various sources and the testimony of prisoners. He also stated that fierce fighting continues in Leningrad. He stated, "Although the German army likes to exaggerate, they have not claimed any progress in the Leningrad area."

German Offensives in the Leningrad and Odessa Areas Were Repulsed

International News Service, Moscow, 24th - Soviet troops engaged in bayonet fighting during a fierce offensive in the Leningrad and Odessa areas yesterday. It is said that German troops have been forced to retreat. The official communique stated that the Red Army, under the cover of artillery fire, launched a resolute attack, finally forcing German troops on the Leningrad front to retreat seven miles. German troops in the Odessa area were also forced to retreat several miles. Moscow Radio announced last night that since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the casualties of the Romanian army have accounted for half of the country's army.

United Press International, Moscow, 24th - News from Odessa reports that the Romanian army launched a hundred attacks in the first month and has now been stopped after advancing one kilometer. The Red Star claimed that Odessa has been surrounded for the 49th day, and fierce fighting is still ongoing near the southwest of the city. The German and Romanian troops suffered thousands of casualties in the Battle of Odessa, and armored vehicles and firearms were destroyed. It also stated that in the battle on the northern front, the German 3rd Division was also defeated. The Red Army attacked from the side, forcing the German army to retreat in disorder.

Havas, Moscow, 23rd - Reports say that most of the Soviet "Daredevil Teams" are composed of young Communist Party members and have now joined the defense of Leningrad and the port of Osa.

### Germany Actively Conducting Military Activities in Bulgaria; Britain Will Send Troops to the Caucasus to Help the Soviet Union Defend Oil Fields

United Press International, Ankara, 24th - Reliable sources here said yesterday that Bulgarian troops are currently moving north along the Danube River, causing traffic jams. It is believed here that a Soviet-Bulgarian war is inevitable.

United Press International, London, 24th - Moscow Radio broadcasted yesterday that Bulgaria has mobilized 400,000 troops, and German engineers are currently building roads. The radio station stated, "The Germans continue to prepare Bulgaria and train Bulgarian troops for war against the Soviet Union and Turkey."

Reuters, Ankara, 24th - According to travelers, Bulgaria continues to conduct military preparations very actively. The Germans have taken over the Bulgarian railways for their own use. Foreigners in Bulgaria are under close police surveillance. Soviet embassy and consulate staff are followed by secret agents every time they go out. There are currently only four Soviet women residing in Bulgaria. Opinions differ in diplomatic circles here regarding German activities in Bulgaria. Some say that the German goal is to facilitate its maritime attack on the Caucasus, while others say that the Germans will put pressure on Turkey after reaching the Caucasus. Some also say that the Germans want to force Turkey to allow their warships to pass through the Dardanelles Strait and transport troops through Turkey. Still others say that the Germans want to seize full power in Bulgaria so that they can use Bulgaria as a base for war against the Soviet Union or Turkey. However, Turkish authorities do not believe that the current developments in Bulgaria have reached a point of endangering Turkey.

United Press International, Ankara, 24th - Several newspapers here yesterday published rumors that Britain may send troops to the Caucasus to cooperate with the Soviet Union in combat. The "Tasviri Daily" said that the number of troops would be about 225,000 and that Germany may demand facilities from Istanbul to facilitate its war against the Soviet Union. However, well-informed circles believe that this request is impossible. Recent German victories have left a bad impression on the Turkish press. Turkish newspapers ridiculed the possibility of effective British and American aid to the Soviet Union.

### German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, Returns to His Post, Carrying a Letter from Hitler

### Allied Representatives' Conference Opens in London Yesterday; Resolution Passed Supporting the Atlantic Charter; Soviet Representative Urges Increased Unity

Reuters, London, 24th - The Allied Conference, chaired by Foreign Secretary Eden, held its second conference here today. Representatives of all countries fighting for freedom unanimously passed a resolution declaring support for the principles of the "Atlantic Charter" agreed upon by Roosevelt and Churchill. Czech representative Masaryk issued a joint declaration on behalf of the Czech and Polish governments, stating that the intention of both governments is to believe that there must be safeguards to prevent a third German-initiated war. Any weapons that Germany may use to continue its aggression must be completely destroyed. The Soviet Union attended the conference for the first time. Its representatives were Ambassador Maisky and Bogomolov. In addition, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Belgium, Free France, Greece, Yugoslavia, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg also sent representatives to attend. In addition to Eden, the UK representatives included Minister without Portfolio, Mr. GreenWood, Dominions Secretary, Viscount Cranborne, Indian Secretary, Mr. Amery, and Colonial Secretary, Lord Moyne.

Eden's Speech

United Press International, London, 24th - Foreign Secretary Eden said in his opening speech that since the previous meeting, great progress has been made on new plans for cooperation. He also stated that not long after the last meeting, Hitler followed his old tricks and suddenly attacked the Soviet Union. Since then, the Soviet government and people have defended themselves with their courage, determination, and talent, and have earned the admiration of the world. Today, the Soviet ambassador is attending the meeting here for the first time on behalf of his government, and I dare say that all representatives present sincerely welcome him. Eden then extended a welcome to the Greek representative before presenting the eight-point program agreed upon at the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, which was unanimously approved by everyone. The meeting was held at the famous St. James's Palace.

Reuters, London, 24th - Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky addressed the Allied Conference on behalf of the Soviet government, stating that the convening of this meeting is timely, as Hitler's Germany, after trampling and enslaving several European countries, continues to wage war against the Soviet Union with force and unprecedented brutality. Since the Nazi invasion, it has been one month. During this period, the Soviet army, navy, and air force have fought heroically, shouldering the great responsibility of fighting aggressors who threaten freedom-loving countries and endanger civilization and culture. The fate of Europe and mankind for centuries to come will be decided in this war of Hitler and Fascism against democratic countries. The first task for those forced to fight Hitler's Germany and its allies is to resolutely defeat the aggressor. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to unite as one and go all out with all our strength and resources. Therefore, all governments sending representatives to this meeting must unite with each other and lay the foundation for postwar international relations so that they will no longer be poisoned by Nazism. The Soviet Union firmly believes that this goal will be achieved smoothly, and the complete and final victory will lay the cornerstone of international cooperation and goodwill, in line with the wishes and concepts of freedom-loving people. The Soviet Union supports the rights of all countries to independence and territorial integrity, and their right to choose their own social and governmental forms, and always condemns acts of aggression that violate the sovereignty of others. The Soviet government has announced its acceptance of the declaration of British Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt, and is willing to provide all possible assistance to the peoples who have been invaded and are fighting for independence. It also advocates for general disarmament.

### Soviet Union Opposes Nazi Philosophy, Vows to Fight to the End; Maisky Explains the Stalin Constitution, Religious Freedom is Absolute in the Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 24th - Soviet Ambassador Maisky stated in a speech in London yesterday that the Soviet people would fight against "Nazi philosophy" to their last drop of blood. He stated that the so-called philosophy of the Nazis is a direct challenge to the principles we believe in and uphold. The Soviet Union advocates that all people should treat each other as brothers and sisters and live in friendship, and that all nations should have self-determination. The Constitution established by Stalin in 1936 guarantees that many ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union have complete freedom of ethnic development. The Soviet Union also recognizes that the internal order of each Soviet country is its own concern. The Soviet Union considers religion a private matter for every citizen. Although many outsiders have misconceptions, religion has not been destroyed in the Soviet Union. Every citizen has the right to believe or not believe according to their own views. One clause of the Stalin Constitution states, "In order to protect citizens' freedom of belief, churches and state schools are completely separated within the Soviet Union, and it is recognized that all citizens have the freedom of religious worship and anti-religious propaganda." In 1940, there were more than 8,000 independent religious churches of various kinds within the Soviet Union, with approximately 6,000 clergy. Believers were free to practice their faith, go to church for worship, marry in church, baptize and name children, hold religious ceremonies, celebrate religious festivals, and freely elect their leaders. The Soviet government does not assist any particular religion, but exempts buildings used for religious ceremonies from taxes. Soviet courts punish those who violate the rights of believers. Orthodox believers are the most numerous and are currently divided into two major factions: the "New Church" and the "Old Church." The Old Church is expanding its influence to other countries, especially the United States. Other denominations include the Evangelical Church and the Adventist Church, among many others. Generally speaking, there are many kinds of religions in the Soviet Union, and their activities are not hindered, it is said.

### Leader of the Free French Forces Announces the Organization of a National Committee to Exercise Power for the Liberation of the French Nation Until a Legitimate Government is Established

Reuters, London, 24th - General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French Forces, announced yesterday the organization of the Free French National Committee as the trustee of France, until a representative government in accordance with the constitution is established. De Gaulle... the United States and other countries will now decide whether to recognize this committee in place of the Vichy government. The list of members of the new committee will be announced today, totaling eight or nine people, who are representatives of the free French authorities around the world who can freely represent the views of French people and are qualified. De Gaulle will continue to serve as the leader of the Free French Forces, and the Defense Council of the Free French Forces will not be replaced by the committee, but will continue to work in special areas of France such as Africa, the Far East, and the Pacific. De Gaulle also stated that the committee will share the responsibility of exercising power with him. The committee has only one policy, which is to seek the liberation of French territory. The committee will recognize itself as a temporary trustee to represent the French people who cannot express their wishes except through Free France, and will... the backbone of organizations that can exercise national sovereignty in the future. De Gaulle, referring to the Free French Defense Council under the new National Committee, stated that the war has shown the necessity of decentralization in various regions. The Defense Council has addressed this need in the most appropriate way. The British government's dispatch of Duff Cooper and Lyttelton to Singapore and the East is also an acknowledgment of the necessity of local decentralization. I wish to clarify our position on the legal status of the laws of the French Republic. This constitution and laws were destroyed by the invaders, and subsequently... gradually destroyed by the Vichy government colluding with the invaders. The Free French will never recognize these destructive acts. From now on, the Free French must exercise powers equivalent to those of a body representing national interests, and will return this power to the national representative body as soon as possible.

The Free French Forces Have Strong Strength

Reuters, London, 24th - An officer of the Free French Forces stated yesterday that the Free French Forces currently have 100,000 fully equipped soldiers and 1,000 trained or training pilots, and a large number of Free French are helping to protect shipping in the Atlantic. The number of French people escaping from France and prisoner-of-war camps in occupied territories and managing to reach the coast to join Free France is increasing daily. The spirit of France is not dead. According to the letters received, 95% of the French people are waiting for an opportunity to assist Britain in winning the war.

### London Observers: Japan Seeks Opportunity to Attack the Soviet Union; Japanese Spokesman Discusses Soviet-Japanese Relations; Protest Against Floating Mines Has Received Reply

United Press, London, 24th - Foreign ambassadors, when interviewed by the United Press today, predicted that if the German army occupies Rostov and seizes the Donets River basin in the former Soviet Union, and penetrates further into the Caucasus, then... the German alliance will begin to operate in the coming... if the German army achieves these goals in the spring, then Japan will attack the eastern border of the Soviet Union. They declared that Japan will wait until the Soviet Union has definitely lost half of its war and industry before providing assistance. German diplomats pointed out that the Soviet Union's loss of its raw material and military equipment center in Ukraine, and the potential fall of Leningrad as a manufacturing factory for Moscow, would cause the Soviet Union's western army to rely on factories in the Urals and east of the Urals. This situation would further weaken the Soviet Union's Far East army and encourage Japan to begin its offensive, it is said.

Havas, Rome, 23rd - Mussolini's newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" published an editorial today urging Japan to act in a timely manner, stating briefly that Japan is now in an extremely advantageous position and should adopt a resolute attitude to implement its Asian plan.

Reuters, Tokyo, 24th - Government spokesman Ishii, when meeting with news reporters today and answering questions, said that the Soviet Union still has a great possibility of transporting war materials to Chongqing, but the Japanese government has not obtained definite information and he cannot say whether this action violates the neutrality agreement between the two countries. However, he believes that this action is indeed an unfriendly attitude of the Soviet government towards Japan. The spokesman also ridiculed the rumor spread by Chongqing that conflicts had occurred on the Manchurian-Soviet border, saying that everything is peaceful in that area. He then said that the Japanese government has not yet received a response from Moscow regarding its protest against Soviet mines reaching the Japanese sea. Although this is not a major event, the Soviet Union is very willing to discuss this issue with Japan. Ishii also answered questions, saying that although the United States and the Dutch East Indies no longer transport oil to Japan, Mexican oil is still flowing in. When asked whether the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" report that there is anti-Japanese sentiment in Bangkok political circles is credible, Ishii replied that this is the newspaper's observation, and he believes that some of it must be credible. He did not mention that the recent loan from Thailand to Japan has been used up and that negotiations are currently underway for a larger new loan. The original loan was not large, it is said.

Reuters, Tokyo, 24th - Government spokesman Ishii stated that the Japanese side has received a reply from the Soviet Union regarding the protest against the discovery of Soviet floating mines in the Sea of Japan near Korea. The reply does not indicate that the matter has been resolved, and talks between the two sides are still continuing.

### Factory Management Law During Air Raids

Chongqing - The Ministries of Social Affairs and Economic Affairs recently jointly drafted temporary measures for factory shutdowns, resumption of work, and wage allocation during air raids, which were announced and implemented on September 3. The original text is as follows: Article 1. Each factory should build air raid shelters or other air defense facilities and should pay attention to the strength of the project and sanitary facilities to ensure the safety of workers. Article 2. Work should be suspended immediately after an air raid alarm is issued, but factories with air raid shelter facilities that can be reached within five minutes may suspend work when an emergency alarm is issued. Article 3. Before leaving the factory after work, workers should properly handle the important tools, items, etc. of their assigned work and should not abandon them. Article 4. If the alarm is lifted one hour before the end of work, work should be resumed immediately. Article 5. If the alarm is lifted before 10:00 p.m., work should proceed as usual the next day. Article 6. If the alarm is lifted after 10:00 p.m., the start time for work the next morning should be postponed accordingly, based on the time from 10:00 p.m. to the lifting of the alarm, but the end time for work should still be as usual. Article 7. During air raid time, wages should be paid as usual, except for workers who do not resume work in accordance with the prescribed time. The wages of piece-rate workers during air raid time should be calculated and paid according to the standard of the number of pieces worked during the same time on the previous day. Article 8. If the air raid continues without being lifted, or if the factory has suffered damage due to the air raid and cannot resume work, wages may be allocated at one-third or one-half of the wages, depending on the economic situation of the factory and the amount of wages earned by the workers. The same applies to workers whose contracts have not yet expired and other temporary workers. Article 9. If the factory has suffered excessive losses and cannot resume work, workers may be laid off, but severance pay should be paid. Article 10. These measures will be implemented from the date of joint announcement by the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Social Affairs. (Electric Dispatch on the 21st)

A Discussion of the European War (83)

### A Comparison of Stalin and Hitler

Stalin achieved dictatorship due to his tenacious nature, complete ruthlessness, skill in using divisive tactics, and especially his ability to seize opportunities. He took Lenin as his own model, a guiding star, but Lenin knew Stalin's weaknesses very well. According to Stalin himself, Lenin once mentioned him, "This person is crude in nature and has great desires, he may therefore cause the party to split." Later, Stalin did as predicted, but he did not split the party, but completely purged the opposition within the party, so that three-quarters of the members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the Presidium of the Congress, the leaders of the army and navy, diplomatic personnel, government members, and heads of various departments, as well as factory managers and leaders in various parts of national life, disappeared, or resigned for their own and the country's interests.

There is a French proverb that says that everyone has their own character flaws. Stalin at least has character in his flaws. He is a strong, stubborn, suspicious, and self-confident person. He never ignored the two basic factors in the Soviet Union's international relations for a moment. He was always wary of external attacks and racked his brains, regardless of difficulties, to rectify the internal affairs of Soviet Russia and to meet the needs of modern warfare in terms of economy and industry.

Whether these flaws offset his character is difficult to say. Americans are amazed to see the methods Asians often use to make people loyal and unified. Timur died in his bed, and he conquered more territory than Alexander, but he was also a violent and arbitrary person. Therefore, those who believe that human beings have generosity and compassion and that life is sacred cannot help but feel lost.

Hitler is also a person who disregards everything, but he has been successful so far. In this respect, he and Stalin can certainly be compared.

However, I think that in the eyes of the world, the actions of the two may be very different. Hitler sometimes does not hesitate to bet everything, while Stalin is accustomed to taking advantage of opportunities. I dare not believe this statement to be true. Hitler only took one big risk, like Napoleon at the Battle of Lodi. In fact, famous people in ancient times did not really take risks. Napoleon, before winning a great victory at the Battle of Austerlitz, made it clear to his subordinates that they would hear that the commander-in-chief was stationed in the rear during the battle, engaging in dispatch, and not personally braving arrows. He said this in the orders he issued, and the glorious victory achieved in this battle was also unique in European history.

Hitler took a lucky risk in Munich in 1923, when he and a small team of henchmen, totaling no more than twenty people, were cut off by dense bullets. Hitler's escape was truly a narrow escape. Since then, he has acted after careful planning and no longer takes arbitrary risks. He does not act arbitrarily. The key to his success is meticulous preparation beforehand.

Hitler is Germany, he represents the soul of the German people. I am sure this is true, and the secret of Hitler's being seen as a god incarnate lies here. Russian fairy tales describe a giant, invincible, because his life is not in his body, but entrusted elsewhere. The enemy searches in vain, so they cannot kill him. Until the last day, the hero in the myth finds where his life is and is able to put him to death. It is said that the giant's life is hidden in a duck egg, and the little child called the hero crushes the egg and overthrows the giant. Hitler's life is also hidden in an egg, but this egg is in the body of the German eagle. What I mean is that his life is the life of the German people, he is not an ordinary person like us, but the concrete plan of Germanic... a symbol.

Is Stalin a representative of Russia? I think we still need to consider it if we want to deny it. The tenacity of the Russian people is even greater than what can be imagined from reading Dostoevsky and Chekhov's novels. If you want to understand Russia, you should read Pushkin's works or Tolstoy's "War and Peace." As far as the people of the entire Soviet Union are concerned, they are clever and cunning, and hidden behind a facade of wealth, they are not reliable for friends, but they will never forget enemies. Stalin's personality is also like this, but if we want to estimate his relationship with Russia, we must bring up the old question again and ask whether Russia is European or Asian. The answer is that it is both. I can now say that Stalin represents the Asian side of Russia, not the only element of Russia, as Hitler is the only element of Germany. (End)

### The Ministry of Education Has Already Promulgated Guidelines for the Tutor System in Secondary and Higher Education to Avoid Education Becoming Commercialized

(Chongqing Airmail) In order to correct the shortcomings of the current education, the Ministry of Education has referred to the old system of teacher training and guidance in our country and formulated guidelines for the tutor system in secondary and higher education, and has instructed all schools to follow them. The guidelines are recorded as follows:

(1) In order to correct the current educational bias towards knowledge transmission and neglect of moral education and to avoid the increasingly distant relationship between teachers and students and the gradual trend towards commercialization, this Ministry has referred to the old system of teacher training and guidance in our country and the methods of Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the United Kingdom to formulate the tutor system and ordered secondary and higher education schools to comply with it. (2) Each school should divide the students of each grade into several groups, with each group having five to fifteen people. Each group should have one tutor, who should be a full-time teacher designated by the principal. The principal should also designate one head tutor or training director to manage the student training affairs of the entire school. (3) Tutors should observe the students' thoughts, behavior, academic performance, and physical and mental health, provide strict guidance based on their individual personalities, and promote their normal development in order to cultivate sound personalities (training guidelines will be formulated separately). (4) The training method is not limited to one type. In addition to individual training, tutors should make full use of after-school and holiday time to gather students in their groups to hold talks, discussions, field trips, etc. for group life training. (5) Tutors should record in detail the students' personality, thoughts, academic performance, and physical condition in accordance with the format and report to the school and students' parents once a month. The reports submitted to the school may be consulted by the competent educational administrative authority at any time. (6) Tutors of each group should hold a training meeting once a month to report on the implementation of training in each group and to study common problems related to training. The training meeting should be chaired by the principal. If the principal cannot attend due to circumstances, the head tutor or training director may attend on his behalf. (7) Tutors of each group should be responsible for the students' thoughts and behavior. If the students make special contributions in academics or careers after graduating from school or leaving the school, the honor should also be given to the original tutor. If the students' behavior is improper or their thoughts are incorrect due to the original tutor's ineffective training, the original tutor should also be held jointly responsible. The examination method will be formulated separately. (8) If the tutor believes that a student is not suitable for training, he may request the principal to approve his removal from training. The student removed from training may choose one of the tutors in the school to receive his training. If he is removed from training again, he will be expelled from the school. (9) When students graduate, the tutor should issue a training certificate, adding comments on the students' thoughts, behavior, and academic performance. This certificate may be consulted by the relevant parties at any time when students go on to further studies or seek employment. (10) This Ministry will designate inspectors to inspect the implementation of the tutor system in each school at any time and report to the Ministry on a special project. The educational departments of each province and city should send inspectors to inspect and guide at any time. (11) Each specialized school and university may formulate detailed rules for the implementation of the tutor system based on these guidelines. The detailed rules for the implementation of the tutor system in secondary schools may be formulated by the educational departments of each province in accordance with the three guidelines. (12) These guidelines will be implemented after being submitted to the Executive Yuan for record.

### British University Dormitories are Insufficient; Colleges are Separately Relocated

Students from Afar Pay Rice in National Currency

(Lishui Dispatch) The Zhejiang Provincial Yingshi University has recently added new students. The existing dormitories are not sufficient to accommodate them. It has been decided to relocate the colleges separately to suitable locations. The College of Agriculture will be located in Songyang, and the College of Engineering and the College of Medicine will be located in Longshui. All students of the second year and above in each college will start classes at the aforementioned new locations. Also, because the houses in the three places still need to be repaired and constructed, and cannot be completed at the same time, it has been decided that the College of Agriculture and the College of Medicine and the agricultural training courses will start school on September 20 and start classes on the 25th. The College of Engineering will start school on October 1 and start classes on the 6th. The school has notified all old students separately. As for the freshmen of each college and the cooperative training courses, they will still have classes at the original site of the university in Lishui, and will all start school on September 15 and start classes on the 22nd. Freshmen must first receive freshman training when they enter the school. As for the rice needed by new and old students, the school previously notified all students to bring dried grains for payment when registering for school. Recently, in view of the difficulty of transportation, students in Lishui, Songyang, and counties with convenient transportation still need to pay grain, while students from other remote areas will temporarily pay 150 yuan in national currency (profit or loss will be compensated based on future grain price fluctuations). Students have also been notified uniformly.

### This Year's Western Union Football Tournament, Registration Closes Today

Chinese League Likely to Fail

Registration for this year's Western Union Football Tournament was originally scheduled to close on the 5th of this month, but was postponed due to reasons. It will now close this afternoon. Those who wish to participate can complete the procedures at the association's office at No. 4, Room B, No. 119 Nanjing Road today. This year, due to the prohibition of matches between Chinese and Westerners by the police authorities of the two concessions, the association has changed the competition method and set up Chinese and Western championships respectively for competition. Among the Chinese teams that had previously registered, there were originally five or six teams, including Youyou, Park League, Yousheng, Hualian, and China Tobacco. Later, in view of the separate championships for Chinese and Western teams, lacking competitive interest, Youyou, Yousheng, Hualian, and China Tobacco Company and other teams have declared their withdrawal from the Western Union. Therefore, after the registration closes today, it is feared that the Chinese championship group will be announced to fail. It is reported that the Western participants in Group A include Western Police, French Merchants, St. Francis, North Western, Portugal, Racks, and the Jewish Association. The French Army, the champion of Group B last year, may be promoted to Group A. In addition, the Executive Committee of the Association is scheduled to hold a meeting this afternoon to review and approve the participating teams.

### How to Study Today's Chinese Geography (3)

— Tan Lian

It is said that the section of the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway (ie the Xukun Road) in Yunnan will be completed between summer and autumn. Some say it has been opened from Kunming to Xuanwei, and some say it has been opened to Qujing. I don't know which is correct. The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway has been opened from Liujiang to Desheng. The Longhai Railway continues to be opened from Baoji to Tianshui. After sorting out, the Qianjiang River in the waterway has been opened between Sichuan and Guizhou. The Minjiang River has been actively repaired. Nine dams have been completed between Shaxi, Yong'an, and Ninghua, and the waterway is smooth. This is what should be studied in terms of transportation.

After the war, the Huai River Guidance Committee moved west to Sichuan to assist in improving water conservancy construction in the southwest, and cooperated with the Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan water conservancy agencies and the provincial government to conduct surveys and designs as much as possible for the irrigated area. As a result, 2,165,000 mu of barren land have been turned into fertile fields. It is estimated that after one or two years, the canal construction will be completed in order, and 2.7 million mu of fertile fields can be added. Other Meihui canals in Shaanxi irrigate more than 13,000 mu of farmland, and the Weaver Girl Canal irrigates more than 10,000 mu of farmland. (The Jinghui Canal and Weihui Canal irrigate the widest fields, but they were not completed after the war, so they are not counted). The Tao Hui Canal in Gansu irrigates more than 30,000 mu of farmland. This is what should be studied in terms of water conservancy.

The entire operation depends on economic strength and productivity to support it. The increase in fertile fields after the implementation of irrigation in the free zone in agricultural production can be seen in the water conservancy section, and the increase in agricultural output can be seen. However, there are no accurate statistics on the output of rice and wheat for comparison. Guangxi Province produces less cotton. In the Republic of China, there were only 87,000 dan in 1937, 105,000 dan in 1939, and increased to 552,700 dan in 1940. Open spaces and barren fields have been turned into cotton fields. The provinces of Sichuan and Hunan produced about 1 million dan of cotton in 1937, which was equivalent in 1940. The minerals that have always been famous are tungsten in Jiangxi, antimony in Hunan, tin and copper in Yunnan, and mercury in Guizhou. After the war, the output of tungsten ore was under control and increased from 12,000 tons to 20,000 tons.

### Yarn and Flowers, Many Rumors of Profit and Loss, Double Horses Create a Chaotic Situation, Speculation If Not Careful... Money in Your Pocket Flies Away

The yarn market has returned to a chaotic state, fluctuating up and down, changing four times a day. This kind of scene is rare in recent times. It is conceivable that the speculators are distracted. In fact, the chips have increased, and the air is broadcast. Buying at any time, and financing at any time. In this way, the speculators' desire to make money is even stronger. There are people who make profits, but most of them are empty. The money in the pocket flew away. Initially, the Hong Kong gang has been delayed for a long time recently. The procurement activities in the past two days have made the bulls excited, and everyone is optimistic. Afterwards, rumors suddenly arose, saying that there was another ban on exports. The shorts were very active. The bulls, seeing the bad head, took the opportunity to slip away. The market was originally high-end, as long as bad words are said, the reaction will rise, and the market will go down. A child's double horse's high price is 1,775 yuan, and the low price is 1,753 yuan. The afternoon opening was mediocre, and the price was 1,743 yuan. Then it gradually rose, saying that the prohibition of exports conflicted with the interests of the Japanese businessmen and would not be realized. If it only refers to the free zone, the way out is limited, and it does not matter whether it is prohibited or not. Therefore, the buying sentiment was revived and rose to 1,768 yuan. However, the price was high, which aroused the praises. Before the close, it suddenly fell from 50 yuan to 40 yuan, straight down to 1,736 yuan. The situation was chaotic for a while. On the table, only hands stretched out, but some people came back to buy cheap goods and collected hundreds of packages, returning to 1,743 yuan to close the market. But after the close, the market rebounded and made to 1,747 yuan. Finally, it returned to 1,742-3 yuan. The exchange heard of this situation, and the cotton yarn had closed. The cotton cloth closed suddenly fell five-hole angles. In short, the price is already high, and the range of changes will naturally expand. However, the panic before the close is inevitable. This is because the floating accounts are fleeing for their lives.

The opening of Shuangma in the morning continued the strong momentum of the afternoon of the previous day. The first round jumped to 1,766 yuan. As soon as this price opened, everyone was shouting to enter. After a while, it rose to 1,775 yuan. However, a certain big player took advantage of the situation to spit out, and the table was loosened. It was said that the Guanggang trading was not as enthusiastic as the previous day, but it still handled more than 400 packages, so the popularity was still maintained. At 1,772 yuan, it was once seen to turn around. After 11 o'clock, the exchange closed suddenly fell by seven or eight yuan to more than ten yuan. The popularity was sluggish, and it was said that cotton yarn was prohibited from exporting. The selling momentum was strong, and it fell to 1,753 yuan to close the market. But after the close, the selling sound suddenly vibrated, and it went straight down to 1,738 yuan. The capital was not available. According to the half-day turnover statistics, 10,415 packages were made. The amount of each gang purchased is listed as follows:

Colleagues 10.000 Hong Kong 415

Statistics 10.415

The futures market situation of Jinshuangma, the rabbit rises and falls, and the trend is extremely chaotic. It is based on frequent rumors and anxieties. It is impossible to grasp whether it rises or falls. When the morning opened, initially, the US cotton continued to rise slightly, and the old factory orders still absorbed as always, so it rose first, and the short positions on period yarn were uneasy. Then, the hedging and buyers were extremely enthusiastic. Especially the exchange was also high, which further fueled the momentum of buyers. Therefore, October opened at 1,671 yuan, and it rose immediately. The long-term followed suit, and November reached a high price of 1,688 yuan. December was also 1,720 yuan, close to the peak. The near-term also rose to 1,675 yuan. After entering, suddenly the rumors were raging, and the factory orders saw a sharp drop first. The multi-party front seemed to be shaking. For a time, the rumors were spreading, and the yarn sellers were full. The near-term fell to 1,660 yuan, November fell to 1,677 yuan, and December suddenly fell sharply to 1,700 yuan in the afternoon. The afternoon closed down 4.5 yuan to 8.5 yuan. The afternoon still rose first and then fell. The feet of the land were affected by rumors, and it seemed that the rising trend had cracked. If the rumors can be confirmed, there may be a possibility of continued decline. As a result, October was 1,668 yuan, the closing price fell 1.5 yuan, November was 1,683 yuan, because it had closed, it was still good for one yuan, and December was 1,710 yuan, only 7.5 yuan. Here is a list of the market prices that have been touched.

### The Impact of the Cheap Sale of US Loan Cotton Will Lower the Entire Cotton Market

The order transaction of foreign cotton foreign companies in this port has been affected by the US government's cheap sale of loan public cotton. The entire cotton market has a tendency to continue to decline. Although the current order transaction is quite difficult due to the required procedures, and there is little hope, but with the cheap selling price, the demand for goods from all parties is undoubtedly very eager, which is a good opportunity to try to purchase in large quantities. As for the current cotton situation, because there are not many sources, and all parties are interested in purchasing, at the same time, some factories have no way to directly order foreign cotton, and turn to purchase current cotton. Therefore, although the market situation is slightly soft due to the decline in foreign cotton markets, there is no sign of a sharp decline.

The New York cotton market rose in the early morning due to speculative buying of counter-action theory and absorption by the industry, and then fell due to the large number of bulls taking profits. As a result, the closing price was slightly higher than the previous day, ranging from five to six pounds.

The Indian cotton market rose first due to brokers' replenishment and purchases by European exporters, and then fell back due to floating profits. Yesterday's closing price fell by two to eight robies each. It is also predicted that the opening market today will be bearish (0.2.5 robies).

Another message, the current cotton market continued to be firm in the morning. The price of Indian cotton has reached a new peak. The public sees that the sea stock is not thick, and the orders are very difficult, so they try to absorb it. However, the cotton market changed suddenly in the afternoon, and people's minds were slightly hit. The transaction market is still tight with coarse cotton, and the future is unpredictable.

### Finance, Chao Gang Absorbs, Cash Rise is Strong

Yesterday, the market was squeezed. Affected by the suspension of the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate for the offset of legal currency in Hong Kong, the October period was only one yuan high or low. The final squeeze was only one yuan. About 100 taels of the transaction were concluded, and the price was 6,892-3 yuan. Re-seeing the stagnation, the cash rise gradually became stronger. The Jin Hao Xianghe resumed its advance, and the Chaozhou gang of the silver building industry also absorbed it. Since the first transaction was seen at 9:50 in the morning, Yongfengyu first sold 40 taels to Tianyuan, and the price was 9,050 yuan, which was 30 yuan higher. The Russian saw Dafeng 10 yuan lower and sold 20 taels to Chengdada for 9,040 yuan. Tianyuan returned 10 taels to Wanfeng, and the price was reduced to 9,030 yuan. The silver building gang and the Jin Hao suddenly came to compete, and they immediately raised 30 yuan. Xianghe entered Taikangrun 20 taels, and Xintianda each entered Dafeng 50 yuan, and Xiangxingyong entered Tianyuan 10 taels, all for 9,060 yuan. Yangqing and entered Taikangrun 10 taels for 9,070 yuan. Xiangxingyong re-entered Xinyuan 10 taels, and the price rose to 9,075 yuan at noon. No transaction was seen later, and the price was squeezed up 55 yuan compared to the last price of the previous day. The same day was 45 yuan high or low, and the transaction was two hundred and several taels. The market price of Jinmen brand gold was 9,100 yuan, and the purchase was reduced by 200 yuan. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday, and the jewelry gold was also listed at 10 yuan higher, totaling 930 yuan.

The future has become a dead market

Ha Chi October period per piece (ten taels), opened at 9:15, first by Tianyuan selling 20 taels to Jufengyong for 6,893 yuan, which was 2 yuan higher. Then Yu and Yong exited Hongqingyong 30 taels for 6,892 yuan. Later, it tended to be stagnant and settled. Until noon, the above price closed, and the difference was only one yuan compared to the previous day.

Ornamental gold is listed at 10 yuan

The price of gold ornaments per tael in the silver building, Datonghang and Xintonghang, were both listed at 10 yuan higher at 10:30, which was 930 yuan, and the purchase was reduced by 50 yuan.

### Black Exchange Rate Bulls and Bears, Engaged in Mutual Settlement

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC listings were flat, the HSBC small counter sandalwood price was stagnant, the British and American exchange black market was tight. However, the French Banque de l'Indochine still had selling positions, and the price was 4.625 yuan. There were many Chinese speculators who squeezed each other, and the price was initially 4.8125 and 75 yuan. The Chinese bulls were squeezed. The Chinese banks and the fourteen British and American commercial banks have a unified method, squeezing and selling to foreign banks at 4.875 yuan, and selling to Chinese banks at 4.9375 yuan. The underground activity of importers who are not allowed to apply has weakened, so the US dollar was received at 4.6875, long 0625, and there was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Hong Kong, 24th (Wednesday) Electric, the exchange market opened smoothly this morning, and there was no prosperity in each exchange rate. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Tianjin, 24th (Wednesday) Electric, the exchange market opened flat this morning, and the London telegraphic transfer was tight at 0625, which was two pence 875. The New York telegraphic transfer was unchanged and still stood at 4.875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 50 cents to 86 yuan. The "United Banknote" dark market was 75 cents higher at 47.75 yuan.

### Rumors that the Listing will Lengthen, the US Dollar's Decline Intensifies

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, the British, American, and gold pounds and British gold tickets were quite stable, and the market price was stable. The US gold ticket continued to trend downward, and once Hong was 21.5 yuan, and the final price was 21.7 yuan, which was still 35 cents lower than the previous day. It is said that the HSBC bank listing may be lengthened. The Hong Kong summary is in need, and the market price has risen slightly by 5 cents. The Japanese gold ticket and the Korean ticket have both trended slightly higher. The former has risen to 2.37 yuan, and the latter has risen to 2.07 yuan.

### Food, Rice Merchants' Psychology is Different, Hoping for Something to Happen in Southeast Asia

A few foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Yihua Foreign Company Yisheng Wheel arrived in port yesterday morning and carried 500 packages of foreign rice from Hong Kong. It was berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is reported that the Detada Wheel of Hualun Foreign Company carried a large amount of foreign rice from Yangon to Shanghai, which is expected to arrive at the end of the month. (Ancestor)

The rice market continues to see a rising trend. Because the Far East is tense, the rice merchants are all excited. The buying sentiment was strong in the early morning. The football business took the opportunity to take advantage of it, throwing it back and forth. There are also real sales activities in this street and villages. The two advances together, stimulating the shouts, and the market feels firmer. When the bank opened the small twisted 113 yuan, the outer stack 112 and a half yuan, which was more than 2 yuan higher than the previous closing price. Other high-quality Siamese, etc., also opened at 113 and a half yuan, 113 yuan, ordinary 110 yuan, high-quality Saigon No. 1 opened at 125 yuan, No. 2 opened at 114-5 yuan, Zhongguan Yuan Bai Mindang opened at 115-6 yuan, crushed tip opened at 85-6 yuan, eggplant Buddha rice opened at 120 yuan, and second opened at 115 yuan. After this leap, there were profitable floating accounts that took advantage of the high to come out of the cage, resulting in a soft return in a moment. If the bank stack small twisted once depreciated and sold for 111 and a half yuan, 111 yuan, and the outer stack second goods for 110 yuan, but the market changes are unpredictable. It is impossible to predict that after a fall, it will lead to a resurgence of off-market customers to absorb. For a time, the situation turned tight again, and the prices recovered to the early market again, but although there were many changes to this point, it was difficult to produce new prices. Later, it only wandered all the way, and often entered and exited around the early market until the market closed. However, that was all. Yinghua Company 135 yuan to 138 yuan, second 132 yuan, 工部局小絞 224 pounds is 142 yuan 75 cents,成交 一萬七千包,又一千多噸,

Although the arrival of thick japonica rice has become scarce again, most of the lodgers have turned their eyes and paid attention to foreign rice, resulting in a desolate transaction and forming a situation of no honor and no shame. The opening price is similar to the previous one, with Nangang Zao Po still selling for 149 yuan to 147 yuan, Wuxi special thick broken japonica selling for 155 yuan, and Pudong new japonica selling for 153 and a half yuan to 153 yuan.

Although wholesale glutinous rice sales have decreased, the scattered sales are still wide. It is worth the good stop of foreign rice, and there are also scarce goods. The market is very good and continues to show, and the price has increased by 1-2 yuan. Hong Kong high yuan opened at 136 yuan, the big market opened at 133 yuan, the second opened at 130 yuan, and the glutinous opened at 119 and a half yuan, 119 yuan.

### Active hoarding of flour

Foreign flour was transferred from Hong Kong. Yesterday, there were 33,032 bags, loaded and transported by the Yisheng Wheel. The flour was transported from Australia to Hong Kong, and then transferred to Shanghai. (Ancestor)

Yesterday, the actual sales of foreign flour were not weak, and speculators hoarding were even more active. Moreover, there were fixed-price follow-up compensation, and the selling prices of each brand saw a continued rise. In particular, American flour has fixed-price hoarding inquiries, or because the international situation has evolved to hinder the transportation of American flour, it is favored by speculative football, and the situation is more beautiful than Kan flour. However, some profitable bulls returned, and the market price fluctuated. As a result, it rose by another 2.3 and 5.6 corners compared with the previous day. The fort early market was 33.3-4 yuan, 33.5 yuan to 33.8 yuan in the afternoon, and 33.6-7 yuan at the close. Jinlong West stack was 31.5 yuan to 31.4 yuan in the morning, 31.5 and a half yuan to 31.7 and a half yuan in the afternoon, and 32.2 yuan to the East stack at 32.2 yuan at the close.

### Piece Goods, Rumors of Cotton Cloth Embargo, East Piece Goods Turn to Sell to Southeast Asia

The factory cloth market was tight yesterday, and the closing price suddenly fell. It was because the price of goods had been hovering and rising for several days, and the factory's high-priced futures, the industry's intention to enter was strong, so the spot cloth was also raised. However, the market suddenly spread news that the customs had banned exports, and people's minds were turbulent, and the signs of a soft return were seen. As a result, a part of the white goods still rose by half a corner per piece, and the bleaching and dyeing cloth was flat. 500 pieces of various cloths were transacted on this street, and 600 pieces of blue cloth twill bleached cloth were transacted by the Cantonese, Hong Kong and Southeast Asian gangs, and 40-50 pieces of coarse cloth were transacted by the Zhoudong Dinghai gang.

### Silk and Tea: Japanese Tea Dumped in Shanghai

The price of Dai-dai Flowers is unusually high.

Since the UK and US froze Sino-Japanese funds, tea trade between Japan and the US has completely stopped. In recent weeks, a number of Japanese mainland and Taiwanese teas, no less than 20,000 boxes, have been continuously shipped to Shanghai for dumping. However, due to sluggish sales in foreign firms, there is no major outlet. Currently, the only tea transactions in the market are from the Tianjin merchants, who still show interest in items such as "Xiumei" tea tips. Yesterday, over 230 dan were traded, with "Xiumei" selling for 175-176 yuan and tea tips for 150 yuan. Today, 383 pieces of tea are being shipped to Hong Kong. As the route for Japanese tea to the US has been blocked, Chinese merchants are mixing Japanese tea for sale to the US, and sales from shops and firms are quite strong. Therefore, with supply exceeding demand, tea prices are gradually decreasing. Only the "Dai-dai Flower," usually a garnish for tea, is extraordinarily expensive this year. Tea shops are selling it for 1.4 yuan per tael, equivalent to 2,600 yuan per dan, a truly unprecedented price. Fortunately, those who use "Dai-dai Flower" to flavor tea are typically wealthy and leisure, so the high price is of little concern.

### Settlement and Reporting for Export Goods: Approval to Obtain Exchange Rate Difference; Exemption from Export and Transit Taxes; Government to Bear Exchange Settlement Fees; Foreign Exchange for Twelve Major Categories of Native Goods to be Given at Designated Banks

Previously, the reason why the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai was so rampant was, on the one hand, the activities of certain banks and importers, but on the other hand, the freedom for exporters to throw the foreign exchange they obtained into the black market, ensuring a constant supply, was the real reason. However, the authorities had stipulated that when goods were transported for export from other ports, foreign exchange should first be settled at the original port of entry, but due to various reasons, this was not thoroughly implemented. Furthermore, the Central Bank and Bank of Communications in Shanghai were unable to undertake export settlement matters due to environmental constraints. Now, the Ministry of Finance has promulgated the "Measures for Settlement and Reporting of Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement," showing a determination to remedy the situation. The measures are extremely stringent, with a total of twenty articles, designating twelve major categories of native goods for which foreign exchange should be legally given to designated banks, allowing exporters to receive the difference between the legal exchange rate and the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank and Bank of Communications, and exempting export taxes and transit taxes. The fees for handling the settlement of foreign exchange are borne by the government. The full text is recorded below:

Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement

Measures for Settlement and Reporting of Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement, Article 1: The types of export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are designated as twelve categories: egg products, feathers, sausage casings, leather, fur, dyes, medicinal materials, oils and waxes, nuts, timber, silk cocoons, and hemp. The detailed product names are specified separately in the "Detailed List of Types of Export Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement." Article 2: If export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are exported and sold, whether transported and sold by government trade organizations or traded independently by commercial firms, they must sell and settle foreign exchange to the China or Bank of Communications (or the banks entrusted by these two banks) at the legal exchange rate and obtain a purchase of foreign exchange certificate for reporting. Those farmers and vendors who carry goods on their shoulders to the foreign markets along the land and sea borders and whose total weight is less than 30 kilograms and value does not exceed 50 yuan in national currency are allowed to export without foreign exchange settlement. Article 3: The types of foreign exchange settlement for export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are first calculated by the Trade Commission or its designated agency based on foreign market prices. Foreign market prices are based on local market prices, plus all transportation and sales costs and a profit margin of 11%, and are estimated in foreign currency converted at the rates quoted by the China and Bank of Communications. The sale of goods shall be calculated according to the prices stated in the contract for the sale of goods. Then, the China or Bank of Communications, according to the estimated amount in the preceding paragraph and after completing the foreign exchange settlement guarantee procedures with the merchants, shall issue a purchase of foreign exchange certificate.

Measures for Reporting Various Goods for Settlement

Article 4: When export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are reported for shipment, the customs post (or cargo inspection office) at the place of departure (or the first customs post (or cargo inspection office) along the transport route) shall verify the purchase of foreign exchange certificate before releasing the goods, and affix a seal on the purchase of foreign exchange certificate, indicating the date of reporting and the customs declaration number, and affix a seal on the customs declaration, indicating the purchase of foreign exchange certificate number and the name of the issuing bank. The aforementioned purchase of foreign exchange certificate shall be registered in detail by the customs (or cargo inspection office) with its number, the name, grade, weight, and number of pieces of the goods issued by the bank, as well as the reported weight, number of pieces, date of reporting, etc., and then returned to the merchant. If there are any unreported goods in the certificate, when continuing to report for shipment later, the previous registration situation should be compared, and the reported quantity should be checked before release, and the customs declaration should be stamped and annotated according to the regulations. Article 5: After the export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are shipped, the customs posts (or cargo inspection offices) along the way shall check the purchase of foreign exchange certificate or the number of the purchase of foreign exchange certificate annotated on the customs declaration before releasing the goods. When the goods reach the last customs post (or cargo inspection office) within the national border, the purchase of foreign exchange certificate must be checked before export is allowed.

Eighty Percent of Retail Exchange Amount Settled

Article 6: If export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are mailed abroad, the post office shall verify the purchase of foreign exchange certificate before accepting the mailing. If the weight of the goods is less than 3 kilograms and the value does not exceed 50 yuan in national currency, it shall be treated as a sample, and the purchase of foreign exchange certificate shall be exempted from inspection for acceptance. However, for postal delivery by the Hong Kong Fuhua Trading Company, the transfer fee shall be borne by the Trade Commission, and to prevent evasion of foreign exchange settlement, all postal packages must be inspected by the post office for the type of goods, and then sealed and posted by the sender in person. The post office shall refuse to accept packages that have been sealed without inspection. Article 7: Within ten days of the sale of export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement, the person must submit the transaction documents and request the Trade Commission or its designated agency to verify the actual amount of the sale proceeds and issue a certificate of actual sale price, based on which foreign exchange shall be settled with the bank that issued the purchase of foreign exchange certificate or its foreign correspondent bank. Article 8: The amount of foreign exchange to be settled for settlement goods shall be calculated according to 80% of the retail exchange amount stated in the certificate of retail price. The remaining 20% shall be allowed for the merchant to deduct for foreign currency expenses such as insurance, storage, and transportation required for foreign sales operations. If the goods are transported from the southwestern provinces and must pass through foreign ports, and the required foreign currency expenses are particularly high, a request may be made when applying for the certificate of retail price, and the supporting documents shall be submitted to the Trade Commission or its designated agency for transfer to the Ministry of Finance for appropriate reduction of the exchange settlement percentage, but limited to a reduction to 70% of the retail exchange amount.

Obtaining the Difference and Exempting Taxes

Article 9: After the merchant settles the foreign exchange with the China or Bank of Communications at the legal exchange rate, the legal currency that should be obtained shall be paid by the bank at the designated inland location with the consent of the person settling the foreign exchange. Article 10: The merchant shall receive the difference between the legal exchange rate and the exchange rate quoted by the bank from the settlement bank based on the foreign exchange settlement documents, and the legal currency shall be paid at the designated inland location by the original settlement bank with the consent of the person settling the foreign exchange. Article 11: The fees that the bank should receive for handling the settlement procedures for merchants shall be borne by the government and need not be paid by the merchant. Article 12: All goods exported with foreign exchange settlement shall be exempt from export tax. The measures for paying taxes on transit within the country before export shall still be handled in accordance with the current customs regulations. Article 13: Export goods that have been settled for foreign exchange shall not be restricted for transit and sale in the interior. However, if the sales location is in a land area close to the coastline, such as a national border or a war zone, within a hundred li, the merchant shall obtain a license application form for domestic sales from the construction department or trade commission agency of the province of sale and submit it to the department or agency for thorough verification and transfer to the Trade Commission for application to the Ministry of Finance for the issuance of a domestic sales license, based on which the goods shall be reported for transport or mailing. The interpretation of the aforementioned war zone shall be in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations on Blocking Traffic in War Zones formulated by the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan.

Entry into Shanghai Must be Reviewed

Article 14: If export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are transited and sold within the restricted area in the preceding article, a certificate issued by the county government or quality trade commission agency of the county of sale shall be used as the basis for reporting transport or mailing. Article 15: If export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are transited for domestic sale, and the transportation route is by sea or must cross the land border and enter the interior for sale, foreign exchange shall first be settled according to the regulations, and a purchase of foreign exchange certificate shall be obtained for reporting. After arrival at the destination, a domestic sales certificate shall be allowed for inspection, and an application shall be made to the Trade Commission to request the Ministry of Finance to cancel the foreign exchange settlement. Article 16: Those who mail export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement with a special domestic sales certificate shall follow Articles 13 and 14 and shall not be subject to the restrictions of Article 15. Article 17: Export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement that are prohibited items shall absolutely not be transported to the prohibited area, except for transport to the Shanghai concession area, which shall be handled in accordance with the revised measures for reviewing the transport of prohibited items to Shanghai. The interpretation of the aforementioned prohibited area shall be in accordance with the provisions of the various items of Article 2 of the Regulations on Prohibited Items.

Confiscation and Punishment for Violators

Article 18: If export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement are found to have failed to comply with the provisions of these measures and lack the necessary documents, but there is no intent to smuggle, they shall be ordered to submit the supplementary documents for verification and release. If there is indeed an intent to smuggle, they shall be treated as smuggled goods, and the customs (or cargo inspection office) shall impose penalties in accordance with the provisions of Article 21 of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations and may confiscate the goods. If the aforementioned smuggled goods are found by the designated cargo inspection agency, they shall be immediately transferred to the nearby customs or cargo inspection office for handling in accordance with the regulations. Article 19: The goods punished in accordance with the law in the preceding article shall be awarded a bonus according to the following percentages, and the balance shall be reported and remitted in accordance with the regulations: (A) If the goods are found by the customs or cargo inspection office: (1) 20% to 30% to the customs personnel who found the goods, (2) 10% to the personnel of the assisting agency; (B) If the goods are seized by the customs or cargo inspection office based on eyewitness reports: (1) 50% to the eyewitness bonus, (2) 10% to 20% to the personnel of the seizing agency, (3) 10% to the personnel of the assisting agency; (C) If the goods are found by the designated cargo inspection agency and transferred to the customs or cargo inspection office for handling, a bonus of 50% shall be awarded regardless of whether there is an eyewitness, and the inspection agency shall distribute it on its own.

### Fifty People Arrested in Hangzhou and Sent to Shanghai

According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," based on information from the Japanese side, the Japanese military police in Hangzhou arrested fifty secret agents in the city yesterday (the 23rd) suspected of planning activities and seized a large amount of explosives, firearms, and ammunition. These fifty people have now been handed over to the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai for detention and interrogation.

### Sudden Erection of Iron Netting Alert in Front of the Japanese Military Police in Nanshi

###谋福常德等轮被扣谋福、常德等轮被扣、各领再提交涉

### It is rumored that Chinese, British, and American textile factories will receive legal foreign exchange, which will greatly facilitate the arrival of foreign cotton in Shanghai.

According to the "Continental Daily," it was reported yesterday (the 23rd) that the Stabilization Fund will supply foreign exchange to textile manufacturing factories in Shanghai at the official exchange rate, with the exception of Japanese-owned textile factories.

Not Yet Confirmed

However, this statement has not yet been officially confirmed. According to several bankers interviewed by the reporter, recent documents stated that cotton was one of the imported goods for which Shanghai importers could apply for foreign exchange from the Stabilization Fund in September. If the rumors are true, it will greatly benefit Chinese, British, and American textile merchants here.

Japanese Merchants Excluded

Excluding Japanese merchants should not be considered discrimination, as the Japanese authorities have effectively monopolized all raw cotton production in the occupied areas. As a result of the monopoly, Chinese, British, and American textile merchants in Shanghai have had great difficulty in obtaining the necessary raw materials for many months. The rumored new regulations will greatly facilitate the arrival of foreign cotton in Shanghai.

Problems with Film Rental Fees

According to reliable sources, Shanghai cinemas are in imminent danger of being completely forced to close because the Stabilization Fund is not allowing the supply of foreign exchange to pay for foreign film rental fees, and cinemas will be unable to obtain new films. According to a major film merchant, if foreign exchange cannot be obtained, the source of new films will be completely cut off. If cinemas are forced to close, the losses suffered by the Shanghai Municipal Council will be a shortfall of one million yuan in annual revenue, and at the same time, it will exacerbate the unemployment problem. Moreover, since the outbreak of the war four years ago, films have been the only means of relieving the mental suffering of the people, and the loss of this legitimate entertainment is a great tragedy. Film merchants are currently convening meetings to discuss solutions.

Yesterday, an advertisement was found in the North-China Daily News, stating that from September 25th, all export goods from Shanghai are prohibited from being shipped to any ports or cities in non-occupied areas. However, the advertisement did not specify which areas were considered non-occupied. It is said that the purpose is to prohibit all goods from Shanghai from being transported to the Chinese free zone. However, this announcement was not issued by the Jianghai Customs. Yesterday morning, the customs still claimed to be unaware of the matter. It was not until 2:00 PM that they received documents related to this matter. It is understood that the customs will implement it from today due to environmental pressures, but goods shipped to Hong Kong are temporarily not prohibited from export, only their taxes will be increased. After the United States and Britain announced the freezing of Sino-Japanese funds on July 26th, the Japanese tax official of the customs stipulated that more than a dozen types of goods were prohibited from export to foreign countries (excluding Japan) and the Chinese free zone as a retaliatory measure. This time, the prohibition of goods from being transported to the free zone will only cause another type of obstacle and restriction to Shanghai's normal trade. Yesterday, the market price of cotton yarn plummeted amid soaring prices, probably also due to this impact.

### Renji Hospital Chinese Donations

Renji Hospital's August report shows 20,123 outpatient visits. The hospital's work is of concern to society, and therefore it has seen increased progress. This can be seen from the following donations to the bed fund: Victor Victor donated 7,000 yuan, Li Shuxiong donated a million yuan, and the Yang Meinan Memorial Fund donated 16,000 yuan. This donated fund is used for the minimum free hospitalization and treatment of poor patients. Since the last report, general donations to the hospital from the Chinese community have also been very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, the total amount of donations from the Chinese community has reached 42,000 yuan, accounting for about 45% of the total donations, setting a new record in the hospital's history.

### Ticket Sellers Don't Skim

— Wu Dai

In the past few days, who in Shanghai hasn't been talking about the streetcar ticket seller skimming and shoving a passenger to their death? It so happened that a friend who had returned from studying in the United States was present that day. I jokingly said to him, "Do ticket sellers in the United States skim?" Unexpectedly, he replied, "Ticket sellers on public transportation in the United States never skim!" I was taken aback, thinking that this friend had also joined the "foreign moon is brighter" group, and was about to criticize him when he continued, "Because they can't skim."

It turns out that in major American cities like New York or Boston, subway entrances at stations are equipped with automatic turnstiles. Each passenger must first insert the fare into a machine before entering. Because the fare is uniform, you can ride to your destination after entering. After you leave the station, you have to pay the fare again to re-enter. In this type of vehicle, there is no need for a ticket seller at all. Without a ticket seller, how can skimming exist?

But what's strange is that on buses with ticket sellers, their ticket sellers also don't skim. Because there are few types of fares (usually only two: short distance and long distance), selling tickets is also convenient. Their method is that passengers directly insert the fare into a money box, without it passing through the ticket seller's hands. The ticket seller's responsibility is only to punch the ticket and give change.

So ticket sellers not skimming is not an empty ideal, but something that can be done. Of course, we don't want the company to immediately switch to machine payment to eradicate skimming, causing the majority of ticket sellers to lose their jobs. But we believe that after stabilizing the ticket sellers' lives, implementing appropriate education, and changing the ticket selling procedure, ticket seller skimming may become a historical relic.

### Chemical Pencil for Identifying Counterfeit Coins

— Ke Zhong

When silver coins are circulating in the market, identifying counterfeit coins is a major problem. American police authorities have put a lot of effort into educating the public on how to identify counterfeit banknotes, even opening special classes to conduct widespread publicity and teaching. Recently, scientists have invented a chemical pencil that is very helpful for identifying silver coins. The method is to first scrape the surface of the "silver" coin to be identified with a knife, then moisten the tip of the chemical pencil and dab it on the coin's surface. If the coin is counterfeit, a black spot will immediately appear on the coin's surface. If it is a genuine coin, there will be no black spot.

### News Reporter's Blindfold Method

— Si Zhong

When Hitler's blitzkrieg unfolded in the Netherlands, the Dutch authorities kept their mouths shut, strictly censoring the news, and not allowing any reporters to disclose news of the war. However, the New York Tribune's Amsterdam reporter, Kangqi, sent a cleverly worded telegram, conveying the real news to the newspaper. His telegram read: "Everything is peaceful in the Netherlands, the same as the situation around New Orleans, Louisiana around June 1st." Based on this telegram, the New York Tribune published the shocking news that "German troops invaded the Netherlands and the Dutch breached the dikes," making other newspapers pale in comparison. The Dutch news censors couldn't see through the mystery in that report, but the astute newspaper editors were able to find the truth between the lines. It turned out that the so-called "situation around New Orleans, Louisiana around June 1st" meant that the Mississippi River had breached its dikes, and the surrounding area had become a swamp. The Netherlands had become a swamp, so it must have been caused by breaching the dikes, and then the German invasion was self-evident.

When Lenin was critically ill, the news reporters from various countries stationed in Moscow encountered a difficult problem. If Lenin died, the Soviet Russian government would not allow any reporters to publish the news abroad before announcing it to the people of their own country. The Soviet Russian government might temporarily keep the death a secret to avoid domestic changes.

London Hausted's reporter Levin was returning home at that time. He and the newspaper agreed that if Lenin died, he would send a telegram asking the newspaper to remit 150 pounds. After Lenin died, the news censors indeed intercepted all telegrams reporting this event, so Levin followed the original agreement and requested a remittance. Unfortunately, the newspaper authorities forgot the secret agreement and replied, "Overdraft already high, unable to comply," thus missing a great opportunity to cause a worldwide sensation.

During the war between the United States and Spain, American soldiers stationed on Guantanamo Island suddenly contracted an epidemic of yellow fever, causing morale to plummet. The US government immediately censored the news and did not allow the news to be transmitted off the island. The New York Sun's chief reporter reported the actions of colleagues at his station, and the content of the telegram was unremarkable. He said: "All colleagues at this station are safe. Anderson is going to Kingston. Lloyd is here. Jack Ochre is with the army on Guantanamo Island. Li Quexun is in the camp." The mystery in this telegram lies entirely in the words Jack Ochre, because the English nickname for yellow fever is "Yellow Jack." "Ochre" means "red clay" or "gold coin." A few minutes later, the American newspaper published shocking news with the headline "Yellow fever is raging on Guam, affecting countless soldiers."

### Marching Speed

— Xin Liang

According to recent German claims, their army can march at a rate of twelve miles a day for sixteen days. This is truly an extremely high speed.

The American army considers marching fourteen miles a day to be good, and marching sixteen miles is an exception. But historically, there have indeed been several glorious records of marching speed. When besieging the place of Chugevia, Caesar's troops marched fifty miles in one day; fought a battle, and then turned back the next day. In 1806, when Napoleon attacked Prussia, his best soldiers marched at a rate of thirty-three miles a day for thirteen consecutive days. The world's highest marching record, however, still belongs to Alexander the Great, who, after the Battle of Arbela in 331 BC, ordered his army to strive forward, marching at a rate of thirty-six and a half miles a day for eleven consecutive days.

Similar to Hitler's current marching situation in attacking Russia, we can compare it to the American Civil War. At that time, when General Sherman marched through Georgia, he also brought a large number of military equipment and food. Sherman's troops could only march twelve miles a day, which is ten miles less than Hitler.

12 Unexpected Turbulence

At about half past nine, they suddenly heard the sound of someone banging on the door across the street, followed by unclear voices. Gradually, the sound grew louder, and it seemed that several people were arguing. Before long, the two sides began to fight. Qiu Haitang and Old Master Zhang could clearly hear the sounds of Old Shopkeeper Meng and two or three other people being thrown to the ground. Later, there was a burst of extremely rapid running sounds, from south to north, as fast as horses, and there were more than just one or two people's footsteps.

"Ah! It's bad! They've snatched Lin Sheng away...!" Immediately, they heard Old Shopkeeper Meng howling like a pig being slaughtered on the street, and it sounded like two people chasing after them one after the other.

The street suddenly became lively: first, Young Shopkeeper Meng of the Meng family was crying and scolding, followed by the neighbors on the left and right coming out to inquire. Old Shopkeeper Meng was still complaining that his employees were not trying hard enough, and everyone's voices became a clamor.

"This is terrible! Second Young Master is really going to cause trouble!" With someone as clever as Qiu Haitang, he already understood five or six tenths of what was happening after listening to this scene next door; he just couldn't figure out why Yu Kun wanted to gather people together to kidnap the Meng family's young shopkeeper.

But this point became completely clear the next morning.

"Brother Wu, I'm really sorry to disturb you so early!" At about seven o'clock in the morning, the Meng family came over in a rush, standing in front of Qiu Haitang's kang in a state of panic. Old Shopkeeper Meng was the first to clasp his hands and said to him in a pitiful voice: "It's really because some strangers came last night, it seems that there was some trouble with Lin Sheng, and as soon as they opened the door, they started arguing with us.

### A Few Words After Listening to Ge Nenniang's Opening Piece

— Guo Yi

I am fond of ballad singing, but I rarely know people in this field. I am quite close with Xu Xuexing, and we have become increasingly familiar over time. I like his integrity and straightforwardness, which is different from the accumulated habits of the Jianghu. Xuexing brought his female disciples Xuelou, Xuehua, Xuemei, Xuefang, and his son Xuemen, to Shanghai to sing ballads, and more than a year has passed. Xuelou's eloquence is quick, and she is good at describing the characters in the book; Xuehua's singing voice is melodious and pleasant, and her reputation is very famous, and it has not declined for a long time. And the beauty of the opening pieces is especially well-known to the public. Most of Xuexing's opening pieces are written by our clan member, Master Zhi'an. The lyrics are elegant, with the meaning of poetry, and mixed with dialogue, making them even more subtle and vivid, with twists and turns, so that listeners do not find them long and only fear that they will end quickly. Zhi'an is proficient in Kunqu Opera, and his compilation of opening pieces has a legendary atmosphere. It is indeed so outstanding, but Xuexing does not easily give it to him. Xuexing's opening pieces are therefore uniquely superior. Yesterday, I happened to go to the Nanjing bookstore, and Xuexing specially ordered Xuelou and others to sing Ge Nenniang's opening piece to entertain me, which is Zhi'an's recent work. Zhi'an has been compiling this opening piece for them to sing for several months, but I still heard it for the first time. — In this opening piece, in addition to Xuelou and Xuehua, Xuemei, Xuefang, and Xuemen also appear on stage, with a colorful and lively atmosphere. Xuelou plays Sun Wugong, Xuehua plays Ge Nenniang, Xuemen plays Bolo, and Xuemei and Xuefang play the female soldiers. Each sings with their own expressions and spirits. Xuemei, Xuefang, and Xuemen are only thirteen or fourteen years old, but they are already very skilled, which is truly rare. The whole piece is filled with words of loyalty, righteousness, and martyrdom, and it is very inspiring and encouraging. Zhi'an has a deep heart, and even when playing with writing, he is not just doing it casually. I especially like the female soldiers' dialogue: "The place where we live today is still the territory of the Ming Dynasty, so how can you say that the country is dead? How unambitious!" Those who climb the New Pavilion and lament the difficulties of the country, will they know to strive after hearing this? According to Ge Nenniang's deeds, only three or four hundred words are recorded in the Banhiao Miscellany. Other notes do not seem to mention her. How many women in ancient and modern times have the same integrity as Ge Nenniang? And Ge Nenniang is praised by a drama, so her virtue is as clear as the sun and the moon. Now Zhi'an is also working hard to write and spread it like this, how lucky is Ge Nenniang to have this? However, to promote education and uphold morality, and to use this to inspire people all over the world, this kind of writing is essential, so why be afraid of Ge Nenniang's spread and exaggeration?

Zhang Yunhua and Juewen, etc., are cousins, and among the three brothers, he gets along best with Juemin. However, Juehui's love interest is a servant girl from a different class, whose name is Mingfeng, who has been serving everyone in the Gao family since she was a child. In terms of status, they already have the secret that they cannot be together, but Juehui believes that the so-called boundaries between master and servant can be broken. As for Juewen, although he is already married on the surface, and is very affectionate with his wife Li Ruijue, there is a hidden pain buried in his heart, because before he got married, he was in love with his cousin — Mei. They originally had an agreement with each other, but later, due to family discord, Mei was married off by her parents, and Juewen was also engaged to Miss Li by his grandfather. Since he had no power to resist, he had to obey. But his life became even more depressed. He also knew that this big family was bound to collapse sooner or later. So when the old grandfather Gao gave them a lesson, the three brothers had their own thoughts and were not very convinced.

Zhang Cangqiu then invited Bai Shier to drink at an inn, introducing Xu Jing and Liu Yinying to him. He told Bai Shier that these two were from Shanxi, and the one surnamed Xu was his sworn brother, who had fought several bloody battles against the insurgents under Zhou Yuji. After General Zhou died for his country, he came here to join the army. Tomorrow, he would be leading them to see General Wu, requesting to be employed. Bai Shier, knowing they were Zhang Cangqiu's friends, naturally nodded in agreement. He then told them about Sangui's acceptance of the imperial mandate, and said that now was a time when men of talent were needed, and that the two of them would surely be employed. Cangqiu also asked if General Wu had any anecdotes in the capital that could be used for conversation. Bai Shier then told him the scandalous story of Sangui visiting Tian Hongyu and obtaining Chen Yuanyuan, the number one beauty of Jiangnan, as a concubine, who was residing in Wu Xiang's mansion. Zhang Cangqiu, upon hearing this, laughed loudly and said, "General Wu, amidst his busy military life, actually has such leisure and elegance? This is truly no different from Hongfu eloping with Li Jing." Xu Jing smiled and said, "Since ancient times, famous generals have been romantic figures, and I suppose Commander Wu could not avoid this either." Liu Yinying, however, coldly said, "It is certainly not surprising that a general is fond of women, but one hopes that he can value national affairs as much as he values beauty, and do his best to be loyal and intelligent, and serve the country well." Xu Jing nodded and said, "Indeed." Bai Shier gave Liu Yinying a close look, and then said nothing, raising his glass to drink. Everyone drank heartily before dispersing. The next day, Zhang Cangqiu went to see Wu Sangui. He had already asked Ziying to sing his praises to Sangui, so when he mentioned Xu and Liu to Sangui, Sangui immediately agreed. He also told Zhang Cangqiu that he had been ordered to lead a large army into the pass to suppress the insurgents, and that anyone with a skill would be employed. He then instructed Zhang Cangqiu to bring the two men in to see him. Zhang Cangqiu then brought the two men to the yamen to pay their respects. (177)
