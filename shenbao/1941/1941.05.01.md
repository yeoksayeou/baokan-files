With the assistance of both Britain and the United States, the prospects for its future are very good.

Washington - Quo Tai-chi, after meeting with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull yesterday, announced that he was very excited about the prospects for Sino-American cooperation. American support for the construction of the new Yunnan-Burma Railway will be an indication of Sino-American cooperation.

Washington - Chinese Foreign Minister Quo Tai-chi declared that the American aid to China plan will build a railway line to connect southwest China, so that desperately needed supplies for China can be transported to their destinations. The American government has also acknowledged this plan, stating that the majority of the railway will be invested in by the United States, and will be built by Chinese workers under the joint supervision of China and the United States. Those who support this plan all believe that China is fighting for America in the East, just as Britain is fighting for America in the West. They are urging the government to do its best to assist China, and stating that this will allow China to break away from the Soviet Union, as China currently cannot obtain most of its necessities without relying on the Soviet Union. (30th International News Service Dispatch)

Washington - Quo Tai-chi, after meeting with Secretary of State Hull yesterday, stated that Chinese morale has never been as strong as it is today. As soon as aircraft are received, an offensive will be launched against Japan. The most important things at the moment are aircraft and more aircraft. Military manufacturing plants have already been established in the Chinese interior, and if raw materials are sufficient, they can all be fully operational. Speaking of the Soviet Union, Quo said that the Soviet-Japanese treaty is no longer as disturbing as it was when it was first signed, because the Soviet Union has now given assurances regarding the existing methods of dealing with China. Quo said that he was deeply impressed with Hull, considering him one of the great figures of the world today who maintains his principles unchanged from beginning to end. After meeting with the American President for some time, he met with newspaper reporters again, saying that China is very grateful for the British and American currency loans. President Roosevelt has a global vision and understands that aiding China is as necessary as aiding Britain, and that Britain is currently very strong. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing has recognized the importance of this matter and has expressed a warm welcome to it. Japan seems likely to criticize it, but this is unavoidable. However, the British and American governments are unlikely to be swayed by Japanese criticism. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

### President Roosevelt Announces Will Send Ships into War Zone; Planning to Coordinate Appropriate Fleet to Extend American Patrol Range to 2,000 Miles Off Coast for Defense of Western Hemisphere

Washington - President Roosevelt told newspaper reporters yesterday that American warships, for the sake of defending the Western Hemisphere, may enter war zones if necessary. The statement about sending ships into war zones arose from discussions of comments made on Tuesday by the US and Japanese Naval Chiefs of Staff Stark regarding neutral patrols. The President stated that last week he said that a year and a half ago, American ships had patrolled up to 1,000 miles off the east coast of Telawei. When asked by reporters if the patrol range had been expanded since then, the President replied that this was purely a strategic matter, and he could not tell them. For the sake of defending the Western Hemisphere, warship patrols can penetrate the high seas as deeply as necessary, and can even enter war zones if necessary. The war zone designated by Germany around the British Isles is irrelevant to American warships. If it is necessary for the defense of the Western Hemisphere, American warships may enter it, but this is not to be interpreted as American ships currently entering the war zone. The President also stated that he is now appointing the director of the Financial Rehabilitation Agency, Skelang, as the deputy director of the Production Administration to handle priority distribution matters. When reporters asked if the President advocated transferring part of the coastal patrol ships to the Navy, the President replied that an announcement about this matter would be made soon. He did not know of the possibility of transferring American warships to Britain again in the near future. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

Washington - President Roosevelt stated yesterday that under the Neutrality Act, US naval vessels can legally sail into war zones, but solemnly declared that what he said did not mean that the US Navy would sail around England, and stated that the US neutral patrol will expand its scope as much as possible to protect the shipping of the Western Hemisphere, and implied that in the near future, he would order the Coast Guard Commander's ships to patrol in the naval jurisdiction, but refused to make any further explicit explanations on this. (30th United Press Dispatch)

Washington - News yesterday stated that President Roosevelt's words that the activities of American warships are not limited to outside the war zone are intended to correct the misunderstanding that the patrol range of American ships is restricted by law or declaration. The President, based on the Neutrality Act announced on November 4, 1939, announced that a state of war existed between Germany, France, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the various countries of the British Empire. Subsequently, the declaration issued to amend the war zone point in the law also used the same language. Therefore, the President explained today that the phrase "any American ship, whether a surface ship or an aircraft" mentioned in the law does not apply to American warships. A reporter immediately asked the President whether the patrol of the American fleet could be extended to the German combat area around England. The President only replied that he did not know. Observers said that what the President said was a reaffirmation of his previous claim that in order to protect the Western Hemisphere, American patrols are not subject to geographical restrictions. As for the actual actions, from the public's perspective, they will remain a mystery. (30th United Press Dispatch)

Washington - US Naval Chief of Staff Stark recently announced to newspaper reporters the fact that the American neutral patrol has now reached some 2,000 miles off the American coast. It is said that, generally speaking, American warships are currently patrolling in the Atlantic Ocean from high latitudes to halfway to Antarctica. When asked by reporters to explain further, Stark said that compared to a few weeks ago, the current patrol line in the Atlantic Ocean has moved eastward. The greater our efficiency, the more ships we should be able to allocate. Stark told the US Chamber of Commerce yesterday that a large part of the US Navy's expansion program is now proceeding faster than planned. The United States can allocate its resources to the extent that it does not hinder its own security. This statement has aroused speculation as to whether the United States will soon transfer another batch of warships to Britain. Stark also said that we are now planning a fleet that is appropriately matched with battleships, cruisers, aircraft carriers, submarines, light ships, auxiliary ships, and underwater defenses. Our aircraft carrier program alone is enough to give us a highly mobile and extremely powerful naval air force. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

Boston - Former US Minister to Canada, Ken Lamwell, said yesterday, "The sooner the United States joins the war, the lower the price the United States will pay." He arrived here by plane yesterday to discuss the issue of national raw materials with Harvard University professors. He is a well-known economic expert and has long advocated that the United States implement convoys for England. He said, "If international law is not ignored, then we can now be considered to be at war." (30th United Press Dispatch)

### US Air Force Officers Transferred to Serve in the Philippines and Hawaii

Washington - The Department of the Army ordered the transfer of 109 Air Force officers to serve in Hawaii and the Philippines, 69 to the Philippines and 40 to Hawaii. Those going to the Philippines will depart from San Francisco on a transport ship on June 12, and those going to Hawaii will depart on June 15. (10th United Press Dispatch)

### Britain, America, Australia, Holland, and India Establish Gentlemen's Agreement; Rumor that American Ships Arrive in Singapore; Britain Actively Improves Malayan Defenses

Washington - According to reliable sources yesterday, if the territories of Britain, America, Australia, and Holland are attacked by Japan, the above four countries have established a "gentlemen's agreement" to allow each other to use land and naval bases in the Pacific Ocean. (30th International News Service Dispatch)

London - The Daily Mirror reported in its morning edition a Moscow wireless message stating that two US battleships, four cruisers, and other units of the US Navy have arrived in Singapore to assist the British Navy. The newspaper also reported that the Soviet Union said that the US fleet would be used to defend Singapore and Borneo. (30th International News Service Dispatch)

Singapore - Sir Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East, made a statement to newspaper reporters today, saying that we should not stop improving the defenses of Malaya. He will not be drowsy, nor will he allow others to be drowsy. Even with the defenses that have already been established today, we can have a very good performance in any aspect. Brooke-Popham also pointed to a map hanging on the wall, explaining that Malaya, Sumatra, Borneo, and Australia must be considered as a military unit, and said that the threat to Malaya has not worsened recently, but the situation may change within 24 hours. Unless the Suez Canal is occupied, the situation in the Balkans and the Mediterranean will not have much impact on Malaya. Brooke-Popham expressed satisfaction with the Dutch East Indies' willingness to resist any aggressor and not to be tempted by the Axis powers' sweet words, and especially praised the Dutch East Indies Air Force, saying that the excellence of its fighter and bomber squadrons is comparable to the British Air Force. When asked whether he believed that the enemy might attack eastern Australia, Brooke-Popham replied that, from a military point of view, he believed that this was practically impossible, because the attacking forces would encounter resistance on a sea voyage of thousands of miles. Brooke-Popham concluded by saying that his recent meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Cleefens in Manila was purely coincidental. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

### Peace in the Pacific Not Entirely Hopeless; Zeng Gang's Visit to America Suggested, But Washington Unwelcoming

Washington - Well-informed sources recently acknowledged that stabilizing the situation in the Pacific is not entirely hopeless, but they feel that there are endless difficulties in it. These people, in view of the telegrams from Tokyo, are speculating a lot on whether possible steps will be taken to stabilize the situation in the Pacific. The telegrams from Tokyo appear to be an attempt to ascertain the attitude of the United States towards the proposed Japanese-American diplomatic negotiations. At present, the speculation of these people is mostly focused on whether the United States can invite Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka to visit America. Official responsible persons are all silent on the telegrams from Tokyo, because since the telegrams were broadcast, this question has not received an official report from Japan. Researchers of the Far Eastern situation do not believe that the silence of US officials is sufficient to prevent Matsuoka's visit to America from happening. The previous statements of Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary of State Welles have made the attitude of the United States clear, and it seems that any negotiations must be based on various basic principles, but the United States does not believe that peace in the Pacific is impossible. If Matsuoka's visit to the United States can become a reality, it must be the result of the efforts of Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura. (30th United Press)

London - A commentary in the Menzies Dester Guidance newspaper states that Japan is now engaged in southward expansion, and wants to open up the Western Pacific. The extent to which it seeks to expand its power has not been formally stated. What is known is that French Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies must be within its scope. Non-official opinions supporting the promotion of this policy are now becoming more and more blatant. Everything depends on what the Japanese government thinks of the current obstacles. First is the Soviet Union, second is the war with China, and third is the United States. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

### Colonel Lindbergh's Resignation Approved; Isolationist Theories Long Lost National Faith

Washington - The US Department of the Army has accepted Colonel Beiba’s letter of resignation from his position in the Air Force Reserve. Lindbergh submitted his resignation after the President criticized his isolationist views. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

Washington - After Colonel Lindbergh resigned from his position as an Air Force Reserve officer, public opinion did not cause a serious reaction, which was not what most people expected. Colonel Lindbergh became a national aviation hero after flying across the Atlantic Ocean, but his isolationist and defeatist theories had long lost the faith of the American people.

Editorial

### International Labor Day Commemoration

Today, May 1st, International Labor Day, is a memorial day for the common struggle of labor activists around the world to protect their own interests. The staff of this newspaper will also take a day off as usual to celebrate. However, at this moment, China is in an extraordinary period of resistance and construction, and the entire world is enveloped in the atmosphere of gunpowder. Some countries' labor activists, due to national interests, sacrifice their own interests to fulfill their duties in promoting national defense production, or because their countries feel threatened by aggression, they have no choice but to leave their production tools and confront enemy countries on the battlefield. Their interest in this holiday is not only very different from peacetime, but also varies greatly depending on the national situation. The international significance of past Labor Days has faded, and there is no denying it.

Tracing the origin of Labor Day, it was originally to fight for the realization of the eight-hour work system. After more than 50 years of struggle, its development in various countries has always been uneven. Some countries' demands today are much more advanced than the eight-hour system, while others are still stagnating in the slavery and darkness of the pre-capitalist era, depending on the prosperity or decline of the country's economic development. However, in recent years, aggression has been rampant and war has spread. The protection of workers' lives depends not only on their own struggles, but more on whether their nation can maintain independence and freedom. In the past two years, no less than a dozen large and small countries in Europe have unfortunately been reduced to slavery, and their workers have often suffered more than other people. Under the strict rule of fascist dictatorships, workers were already absolutely forbidden to say anything about improving their lives, and struggles were even more strictly prohibited. In the occupied areas, it was even worse. France's past labor-capital disputes were irreconcilable, eventually leading to backward national defense and a war that did not start, which was a very painful lesson and should be a profound warning. Therefore, all countries in the world are emphasizing internal unity to resist external threats. US President Roosevelt's speech not long ago spoke of this with particular emotion. Even in the Soviet Union, which was founded on the proletariat, its recent efforts to build national defense, encourage production competitions, and thereby fulfill its mission to protect the motherland, are almost more than those of the capitalist countries in the world. It can be seen that in this extraordinary era, workers can no longer take improving their lives as the only important thing, and protecting the motherland and enhancing production to stop aggression are important prerequisites for workers to improve their lives. Workers must at all times put national interests first, firmly adhere to their posts, and work hand in hand with other members of society to do their utmost to fulfill their indispensable mission in this great era.

However, it is certainly not just demanding that workers serve the public on an empty stomach. At this time, the price index is rising day by day as the war continues, and the threat it poses to the general public is extremely serious. At this time, it is certainly too extravagant to demand fine clothes and delicious food, but the minimum standard of living must be guaranteed to be warm and well-fed. Wartime economic phenomena change most drastically. Those who sit on assets and trade in goods often reap huge profits in a blink of an eye, not to mention those who manipulate and hoard goods. The income of those who receive salaries often cannot be adjusted to adapt to changes in prices, whether they are mental or physical workers. In China's current situation, the suffering of mental workers may even be greater. The newly rich are extravagant and wasteful, while the producers do not have enough to eat or wear. According to the principles of justice, how can this be considered fair? And where there is resentment, instigation often follows, fueling the flames, disputes arise everywhere, and eventually people's minds become restless and social morality is lost. All kinds of crimes are born from this, causing the entire society to suffer its ills. Looking back at the collapse of ancient Greek and Roman societies, one cannot help but be afraid. At this time, everyone should reflect deeply and find ways to overcome the crisis together. If we can be sincere with each other, help and understand each other, reasonably adjust our lives and work, and take the interests of the nation as the highest guide, then not only can social stability be guaranteed, but also the benefits to the country during wartime will also be very significant.

At this time, the international war against aggression and defending justice directly relies on strong armor and sharp weapons and the efforts of soldiers, and indirectly relies on economic strength and the labor of producers. Today's International Labor Day, the meaning of which is different from the past, lies in the fact that workers, in addition to improving their own lives, must also seriously review and carry out the great mission they bear in promoting the bright future of the world and the nation.

Chongqing: According to sources here, the Soviet Union's new order prohibiting the transportation of military materials through Soviet territory is unlikely to affect assistance to China. Although China had previously received some assistance from European countries such as Sweden via the Soviet Union, the amount was limited and insufficient to meet most of China's needs. Of the two routes to China, the northwest and southwest routes, the latter (i.e., the Burma Road) is now China's main supply route after the Japanese occupation of northern Vietnam. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing: Chinese officials today, when discussing newspaper reports that the Soviet Union had ordered a ban on the passage of military supplies through the Soviet Union, pointed out that the military supplies China obtained from the Soviet Union came from the Soviet Union, so they did not expect it to be affected by the ban, as the order was intended to prohibit goods from being transported from foreign countries to foreign countries via the Soviet Union. It is believed here in China today that this ban may be very beneficial to China, as it prohibits German military supplies from being transported to Japan via the Soviet Union. It has recently been rumored here that an important batch of aircraft will be transported from Germany to Japan, and once these aircraft arrive, there may be important changes in the military situation in the Pacific. According to the few unofficial sources available here, observers believe that the Soviet Union's ban is similar to the United States' export licensing system, with the aim of giving the Soviet Union an important position in diplomacy. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Two Interpretations of the Soviet Ban

London: Yesterday, important diplomatic experts here expressed doubts about the Soviet Union's order prohibiting the transit of military supplies. They said that this ban could have two apparently contradictory explanations. One is that the order is a gesture by the Soviet Union to appease Germany, as the order could prevent Swedish arms from being transported to Turkey via the Soviet Union. Reliable sources reported last week that the Soviet Union had already allowed this transportation. If this transportation is now prohibited, it will harm Turkey's resistance against Germany. Although the diplomatic community believes that Swedish arms are not planned to be transported to Turkey on a large scale, the Soviet Union's ban clearly harms Turkey. This means that the Soviet Union has reversed its previous policy of encouraging Turkey to resist and indicates that the Soviet Union and Germany have reached an understanding regarding the fate of Turkey, but there is currently no evidence of such an understanding. Experts unanimously believe that the Soviet Union's ban may be more important in preventing the transport of arms between Germany and Japan, which are almost entirely transported to Japan. If the ban is implemented in this way, it will inevitably hinder Japan's war against China without betraying the Soviet Union's interests, but it will also deprive Japan of military supplies that may be used against Britain and the United States. The Soviet Union is not concerned about the safety of Britain and the United States. Another impression is that because the ban is unfavorable to Turkey, its essential nature is anti-Axis, but it may also be pleasing to Germany. Iran and Afghanistan will also be affected by the ban, as it prevents these two countries from obtaining large quantities of military supplies from Germany, Japan, and Sweden. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Tokyo Authorities Are Quite Surprised

Tokyo: Although no official news has been received here regarding the Soviet Union's order prohibiting the passage of military materials through Soviet territory, qualified authorities seem somewhat surprised. Although economic negotiations between the Japanese and Soviet governments are continuing, it is believed that they are unrelated to military materials. It is claimed that the Soviet Union's order mentions some exceptions for special permits or trade agreements, and Japan is unlikely to be affected. All the evening newspapers here carried this Moscow dispatch without comment. In addition, a London dispatch was published, stating that some observers said that the Soviet Union's move may be retaliation for Germany's seizure of the Balkans. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

### American Organizations Form Associations to Support Democratic Countries' Actions, President Niebuhr Issues Declaration, Advocating Defeating Aggression by Any Means

New York: American educators, writers, liberals, Democrats, Socialists, radicals, and labor leaders organized the Action Association for Supporting Democratic Countries, with Professor Niebuhr of Christian Ethics as president. A declaration was issued, stating that "Britain gives us hope for progress, while Germany gives us terror, so Britain's victory is absolutely necessary. It would be very foolish to say that it makes no difference whether Germany or Britain wins. We want to make America move towards peace in Europe, but there must be no more Treaty of Versailles." The association advocates that any political, economic, and military means that can defeat the aggressor countries are needed. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

New York: The American magazine Fortune conducted a survey among important figures in the national business community regarding their opinions on the European war situation. The results showed that 84.1% supported preventing Germany's victory at any cost, while only 13.9% believed that Germany's victory could make the world safe, or at least allow the United States to live economically safely without the need for large-scale armaments. Even fewer people, only 8.5%, believed that Germany could establish a new order in Europe that would allow the United States to restore its pre-war trade relations. Half of the respondents supported the development of a national defense program that was unfavorable to trade. 55.4% expressed dissatisfaction with the isolationist stance of aviator Lindbergh and Senator Wheeler.

### German, Italian, and Japanese Representatives Hold Meeting in Rome to Discuss the Expansion of Patrols by the United States

Rome: It was officially announced yesterday that representatives from Germany, Italy, and Japan have met repeatedly to discuss the expansion of neutral patrols in the Atlantic by the United States. Previously, German and Italian newspapers had issued fierce arguments, warning the United States not to expand the scope of naval patrols to aid Britain, and declaring that Japan was prepared to cooperate with Germany and Italy to take action against American ships aiding Britain. The Berlin 大衆報 (Das Volk) said that American warships escorting munitions ships to Britain would cause the sinking of American ships, "The only effect of this matter is the fastest sinking of American ships. There are German blockade weapons waiting on all routes between the United States and Britain." The Rome 人民報 (Il Popolo di Roma) said that Japan is prepared to cooperate with the Axis powers to sink any national ships carrying aid to Britain. (30th International News Agency Dispatch)

### German Troop Transports Concentrated and Ready to Go, Preparing for Large-Scale Offensive, Apparently Aiming to Seize the Suez Canal, Invading Troops Encountered Resistance East of Sollum

London: Newspapers here recently quoted news from Cairo, saying that one hundred German Tekel-type troop transport aircraft are now stationed in Benghazi, and it is expected that there are still many more at Axis-occupied airfields in Cyrenaica. These aircraft must be preparing for a large-scale attack, using paratroopers to attack British troops defending the Suez Canal and Alexandria. The newspapers also said that these troop transports are believed to have flown to Cyrenaica from Sicily. The newspapers also pointed out that at the end of the war last summer, Hitler estimated that Germany would have 1,000 troop transport aircraft, including some Fokker-Wulf aircraft that could carry more troops than the Tekel aircraft. The newspapers also said that Germany must have greatly increased its aircraft numbers in these six months. Military commentators here were very surprised by the strength of Germany's troop transport aircraft force and said that each aircraft could carry 25 soldiers, some field guns, or some armored vehicles, and fly to the Nile Valley three times a day. These commentators also recalled that the Germans had used giant aircraft to transport troops to key points in the rear of the Allied forces in southern Greece. These commentators also said that these aircraft, Palestine, has become a threat. If the Axis powers can occupy the strong base of Cyprus, these aircraft can fly to Palestine twice a day. However, the British Air Force will attack them before they take off. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)

London: Officials said regarding the Axis forces' advance in Egypt that it was "extremely cautious." The small German-Italian force that invaded Egypt six days ago is now meeting at the "Hellfire Pass" in front of Sollum and has only advanced five or six miles in three days. As of yesterday, there was no progress, apparently due to strong obstruction by the British mobile force. The invading troops seem to be mostly Italian troops. Because Sollum has no military value and is extremely difficult to defend, the Italian troops did not encounter resistance when they attacked. It was also said that the Australian troops defending Tobruk have been harassing the Axis forces from there, causing them considerable pain. The land encirclement of Tobruk is not tight. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)

Cairo: A military spokesman stated last night that the fighting in Greece is still continuing, and he could not add anything to what was already reported in the communiques. The Italian-German forces on the Egyptian border, advancing to a point five miles east of Sollum, have been stopped there. Whether this is due to harassment by British patrol teams or air force bombing, or due to supply problems or being hindered by the great sandstorm, is difficult to determine. All four of these factors may have contributed to hindering the enemy's advance. The enemy forces are now scattered along the long line from Tripoli to Sollum, and there are also small enemy forces around Bardia and Tobruk. The vanguard of their attack is divided into three routes, one on the coastal road and the other two on the higher slopes. All three routes of enemy troops have been blocked near Sollum. What is even worse is that the German troops are now encountering difficulties in desert warfare, namely, lack of drinking water, difficulty in transportation, and flying sand and unbearable hot winds. The situation in Cairo regarding Libya is generally calm and optimistic. On the Abyssinian front, after British troops captured Taixi, they have been pursuing the Italian troops from all directions, and local patriotic Abyssinians are now rising up in resistance, increasing the difficulties for the Italian troops. If the Italian troops retreat towards Italian Somaliland, they must pass through a depression lower than sea level, which is extremely hot and difficult. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

### 12,000 German Troops Reportedly Land in Finland, Carrying Tanks and Heavy Artillery Equipment, London Has Not Received Confirmation

The Moscow radio station also pointed out the various difficulties Germany is encountering in the Eastern Mediterranean, saying, "Although Britain has lost its position in Greece, its situation in the Eastern Mediterranean remains quite stable. British supplies and reinforcements can be continuously transported from the Red Sea, so attacks from the Western Desert are still extremely difficult." (30th International News Agency)

### Random Notes on the European War (49): The Joys and Sorrows of Desert Warfare

Among the many problems of desert warfare, the supply of drinking water is the most important. In the Western Desert, beyond the British Army's forward base of Mersa Matruh, all the way to the border of Italian Libya, there is almost no drinking water except for a very small number of dirty wells. There are no railways in this area to transport water, and even Mersa Matruh itself lacks sufficient drinking water to meet the minimum needs of the army. The amount of water needed by each British soldier per day is more than that of the Italian soldiers.

The minimum amount of water needed by a British soldier per day is a closely guarded secret, but it must be around half a gallon. Multiplying this number by the number of people, plus the consumption of vehicles, becomes an astronomically large number. Of course, installing condensers on cars used in the desert can greatly reduce water consumption, but in this desert climate, invisible losses are still very large.

This major supply problem clearly shows the main difference between desert warfare and ordinary warfare. In ordinary warfare, the army can easily obtain supplies locally thanks to the abundance of natural resources, but in the desert, everything one passes is barren land, and both sides of the army are struggling there. Only those who have personally experienced the cruelty of the desert and suffered its poison understand it. Breaking a finger in the desert is even more dangerous than a serious injury elsewhere. The dust in the desert seems to be poisonous. Unless treated immediately, ulceration is almost inevitable. Medical supplies in the army rarely include ointments because ointments only have the effect of attracting flying dust. Sunlight and flies are also terrible enemies, and inhaling too much sand can easily cause stomach problems.

In the early stages of the war, medical teams worked hard, mainly focusing on prevention rather than treatment. After several months, the number of patients per day decreased. Hard training has made people accustomed to this strange new environment, and their physical fitness has gradually adapted to the new pressures in the desert. It can be said that they have become as strong as copper and iron. In areas with better climates, work that usually exhausts people is considered easy by those who have been trained in the desert. For example, the army in Mersa Matruh has created many miracles of digging sand.

Most of their work is very hard. Work in the desert has been like this since ancient times. They have to set up tank traps or dig trenches in the hot morning. At night, a strong wind suddenly rises, blowing back the sand and completely erasing the results of a day's hard work. Even fences made of steel cannot cope with this invisible and extremely fast ground movement.

The movement of sand is very peculiar, sometimes blowing with the wind and sometimes moving against the wind. How it is regulated is still unknown. The world's leading expert in researching the properties of sand (whose name cannot be published) is currently attached to General Wavell's staff because the success or failure of military operations sometimes depends entirely on knowing what changes will occur at a certain time and place.

It is now known that the growth of the large sand dunes in the southern Libyan desert is quite similar to that of mammals. Two large sand dunes attract each other and merge into one, and then separate again after a while. Later, one of them gradually expands and finally separates a small sand dune, which increases in size year by year.

The above are all the environments that are placed in front of those preparing to attack. They bury the supplies needed for the offensive underground under the cover of night, and before dawn, nature helps them cover up their work.

The British army, with only a map and nothing else, surprised and attacked the enemy in this way. Although they are based on the fortress of Mersa Matruh, bound by the overall plan, and must abide by the timing, they are naturally an independent team, and if they encounter enemy soldiers, they can freely engage in individual battles to some extent.

Although the desert cannot hide the army, it is easy to deceive the enemy, which is an incredible thing in desert warfare. If you move the army in a certain direction during the day, raising a cloud of dust that can be seen from dozens of miles away, it is easy to obscure the enemy and mislead him about your true intentions. This is a difficult thing to do on a battlefield that is easy to hide. Because the Western Desert is almost an ideal area for high-powered motorcycles, large armies can move long distances overnight.

The attack on Sidi Barrani on December 9th last year was successful because of this tactic. On the day before the attack began, British infantry marched west along the fortress, as if preparing to attack the Italian military camp of Sofi, 25 miles from the coast. Until night fell, the infantry vehicles suddenly turned north, reached the concentration point, joined the tank team, and launched a surprise attack at dawn. This was the starting point of the Italian army's defeat.

The Western Desert itself is not like the low-lying land of the southeast corner of England, but like it has been scorched by fire, so that not a single blade of grass grows. Of course, after a rain, moss can be found on the ground, but it will wither in an instant, leaving only some remnants. Further south is the desert that the war does not reach. On its northern edge, Siwa is fertile land in the desert, with springs gushing out from the ground to a height of three feet, fresh and unparalleled. In addition, it is the desolate world of the Great Arctic Snow Desert, with only great rivers and glaciers interspersed between them. But the liquid flowing on the sand is not water but sand.

This world seems to violate the phenomena of nature everywhere, often without a drop of water for decades. Although its external structure is based on the same principle as the more civilized and densely populated areas of the earth, travelers often feel its barrenness. The mountains are like burnt paper, with ashes covering everywhere, but that is all. But for those who love the desert, what he can tell you is more than that. The desert also has mountains and water, which can be fascinating, and there are also wonders that humans cannot imagine. This is what people who ignore obstacles and dangers can see in the desert.

### The British Government Officially Announces: The Withdrawal of British Troops from Greece Was Agreed Upon by the Greek Government, Four-fifths of the Troops Have Arrived Safely, German Mechanized Forces Enter Southern Greek Ports

London - This afternoon, responsible parties here announced that at least 45,000 of the 60,000 British troops fighting in Greece have safely withdrawn. Foreign Secretary Eden made the first official statement on the matter in the House of Commons today, saying that the decision to withdraw British troops had been fully agreed upon by the Greek government. He intended that the House of Commons should know before holding debates that the Greek Prime Minister had belatedly delivered a note to the British Ambassador to Athens on April 21, stating that although the Greek government expressed gratitude for the assistance of the British government and the Imperial Army, it had to declare that the Greek army had been fighting a superior enemy for more than six months and had now reached a state of exhaustion, losing some necessary resources for combat, such as munitions, vehicles, and aircraft. This situation made it impossible for Greece to continue fighting successfully, and even more so to assist its heroic allies. At the same time, due to the limited availability of aviation facilities for British troops and the vastness of the lines defended by the Imperial Army, assistance to the Greek army was absolutely necessary. Without it, it would not be possible to prolong its resistance for a few more days. In the above circumstances, how to continue the struggle would not produce any beneficial results and would only lead to the collapse of the Greek army and the useless bloodshed of the Allied forces. Therefore, the Greek government had no choice but to declare that the continued sacrifice of British troops would be wasteful and should be withdrawn in a timely manner as needed. Eden concluded his reply by saying that the House of Commons could see from this note that the decision to withdraw British troops from Greece had been fully agreed upon by the Greek government. (30th Reuters)

London - A communiqué from the German High Command officially stated that German motorized units of the Greek Front Army had reached the southern ports of the Peloponnese and were preventing the continued evacuation of British troops by sea.

### A Puppet Regime Established in Greece, Openly Violating Public Opinion, Royal Subjects Flatter

Berlin - It was revealed this morning that the new Greek government has been organized by General Tsolakoglou and established in Athens. General Tsolakoglou was the commander-in-chief of the Epirus Army, and after being forced to surrender, he served in Albania for five months. (30th Reuters)

London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reported that General Tsolakoglou, who is being persuaded by the Germans to organize a Quisling government in Athens, is less of a soldier. His promotion in the military was entirely due to the Greek royal family. This fact makes his acceptance of this position and attack on the Greek royal family despicable. Tsolakoglou has very few relatives, and the Germans' attempt to induce him to organize the government shows that it is difficult to find first-class figures. From this, it can be seen that the Greek people continue to resist. The US Minister to Greece, Mr. Baralit, has safely arrived in Crete and is in contact with the legitimate Greek government. Tsolakoglou said in his declaration that the purpose of organizing the government is to save the unfortunate people and the country from fire and water. (30th Reuters)

Madrid - According to Karl Vo, a correspondent for the ACE News Agency in London, the British newspapers believe that the British army has not yet fought a decisive battle with the German army. The war between Britain and Germany is like a fight between an elephant and a whale, never touching each other. This is the reason for the British army's retreat. But there is still an eagle about to participate. The eagle's intervention has the power to decide the outcome. (30th Hai Tong)

### Plymouth Suffers Terrible Bombing, Residents Begin to Evacuate, The City Center Turns into a Pile of Rubble, The Old, Weak, Women, and Children are Evacuated to Rural Areas

Plymouth - After being heavily bombed by German planes for days, the most densely populated area of the city has been almost completely destroyed. (30th United Press)

London - Plymouth has recently become the main target of concentrated bombing, and has been attacked four times at night. Therefore, most of the city will be declared an evacuation zone. 10,000 students will be evacuated to the rural areas of Devon and Cornwall. Women with children or who are pregnant, and elderly people receiving pensions, who want to prepare to evacuate on their own, will be assisted by the authorities. This decisive battle was decided at a meeting last night between the city's emergency committee and representatives of the Ministry of Health. According to the latest news, Plymouth suffered great damage in the attack on Monday night, especially in the areas previously bombed. There are fears of many deaths, but the casualties are not as great as in the previous attack. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that four German planes attacking Plymouth on Monday were shot down, three of which were shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Yesterday, there was slight enemy aircraft activity on the east coast, but no bombs were dropped. (30th Reuters)

### The British Parliament Scheduled to Debate the War Situation

London - Yesterday, at noon, the House of Commons discussed the possibility of reorganizing the cabinet and the early debate of the general war situation in Parliament. Prime Minister Churchill stated that a complex, dangerous, and tense war is currently being carried out successfully by our army, and I am sure that no one wants to receive news of the war situation that could increase the danger to our army at this time. The Prime Minister then announced that Parliament could hold a debate on the first day of its meeting after this week, and indicated that Foreign Secretary Eden would be a key figure in the debate. The Prime Minister then read out the motive for holding the debate, saying, "This House approves the government's policy of assisting Greece..." The crowd cheered again. The Prime Minister continued, announcing that he firmly believed that the government would do its best to continue fighting in the Middle East and other battlefields. A member suggested considering the establishment of a Supreme War Inner Cabinet, with members consisting of ministers not responsible for various departments and talented politicians from Australia. This suggestion was rejected by the Prime Minister. (30th Reuters)

### Shen Junru and Others Write to the Soviet Ambassador, Questioning the Soviet-Japanese Agreement, Hoping to Obtain a Supplementary Explanation

Chongqing - Shen Junru and others, who are known for being pro-Soviet, recently wrote to the Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin regarding the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, raising some questions. The signatories, in addition to Zheng , who is in Hong Kong and therefore not listed, also include several professors. They stated, "To the Soviet Ambassador Mr. Pan Youxin, and please forward to your country's leader, Mr. Stalin. From the standpoint of Chinese citizens, we address you with the most sincere enthusiasm. Your country's policy of assisting oppressed peoples' liberation movements and the fact that you actively assist our Chinese war effort have caused the Chinese people to have the highest admiration and unlimited hope for your country. Now, your country has concluded a neutrality pact with Japan on April 13 and issued a declaration mutually respecting the territorial integrity and inviolability of the so-called Manchuria and the Mongolian People's Republic. Although this harms the integrity of our Chinese territory and administration, we cannot help but express great regret. Therefore, we absolutely support the solemn statement of our government announcing its invalidity, and we firmly believe that this is the public opinion of our 450 million compatriots. We earnestly hope that you can provide a supplementary explanation of this agreement on the following points in a timely manner and in an appropriate manner to dispel the doubts of our people and the oppressed peoples of the world: Whether respecting the so-called Manchuria and the so-called Mongolian People's Republic conflicts with the provision in the Sino-Soviet Agreement that the Soviet government recognizes Outer Mongolia as a completely independent part of the Republic of China and respects China's sovereignty within that territory; Whether it will have any impact on the active assistance to our country's war against Japanese imperialism."

### Ministries of Education and Agriculture and Forestry Deploy Students from Agricultural Schools at All Levels, Instructing Provincial Departments of Education to Guide Implementation

(Chongqing Aviation News) The Ministry of Education believes that increasing food production is the most important task at present and has specially decided in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to formulate methods for deploying students from agricultural schools at all levels to engage in food production work, as a basis for the government to deploy students from agricultural schools at all levels to engage in food production work, and has issued orders to the provincial departments of education to guide implementation. The methods are recorded below: (1) Central and provincial governments shall follow the provisions of these methods when deploying students from agricultural schools at all levels to engage in food production work.

### Reading and Tools

— Zhou Liangsheng

No matter what we do, we must have tools. Confucius said, "If a workman wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools." (See the Analects) The so-called "tools" are instruments. Mencius said, "Even with the clarity of Li Lou's vision and the skill of Gongshu Ban, without compasses and squares, they cannot create perfect squares and circles; even with the keenness of the music master's hearing, without the six pitch-pipes, they cannot rectify the five tones; even with the way of Shun, without benevolent governance, he could not effectively govern the world." (See Mencius, "Li Lou" Chapter, Part 1) It can be seen that no matter what we do, needing tools and needing a purpose are equally important. Reading, of course, requires appropriate tools. What are the tools for reading? The most important and fundamental ones are the textbooks in primary and secondary schools, such as Chinese, English, arithmetic, natural history, physics, chemistry, geography, history, etc.

The subjects studied in primary and secondary schools, such as Chinese, English, arithmetic, physics, chemistry, etc., although they are all individual books, can only be regarded as various tools for reading. Why? Take Chinese, which we study for salary. We study Chinese to prepare ourselves to be able to read a variety of Chinese books in the future, understand the methods of Chinese writing, so that we can use it with ease. Take English, which we study. We study English to prepare ourselves to be able to speak when interacting with foreigners in the future and to be able to read English books. Similarly, studying arithmetic, physics, chemistry, etc., is only preparing us to be able to read advanced books on arithmetic, physics, chemistry, etc., in the future. For the sake of life, we must seek knowledge. In the process of seeking knowledge, the act of reading requires many tools. If we are now in secondary school, we must learn those subjects, such as Chinese, English, mathematics, science, etc., diligently and without relaxation, to strengthen our tools for reading. Like building a house, we must first lay the foundation and then begin construction. The foundation of learning is undoubtedly the knowledge of writing and various common subjects. Assuming that the level equivalent to graduating from junior high school is the preparation, on this foundation, we can begin the construction of learning. In other words, we can begin systematic and disciplined research. This means that studying writing and various common subjects in primary and secondary schools is our tool for reading. We must first study the tools well, and then we can talk about reading. Some people say that young people today, and even the general public, often think that students who go to ordinary middle schools or primary schools, if someone asks them what they go to school for, their answer must be to read. Even the person asking the question thinks that they are indeed going to read. In fact, this is wrong. We do not go to school to truly read, but to learn the tools and methods of reading. At the same time, we also receive some preliminary training in practical social life. This is a fact. Needless to say, some students seem to regard textbooks as unimportant, even expressing a feeling of disgust. They are unwilling to study textbooks seriously. The origin of this mistake is a lack of understanding that all subjects in school are for learning the tools and methods of reading. Xia Mianzun said a few words that are very insightful. He said, "Among middle school students, not many are able to read textbooks well. Some middle school students like to read novels, casually look at magazines, and throw textbooks aside. Some middle school students are happy to read Chinese or literature, but get a headache when they see books on science or mathematics." This is obviously a biased and bad phenomenon. Although ordinary students do not have this kind of bias, they also seem unable to make full use of textbooks. Textbooks are specifically compiled for learning and are not particularly remarkable works, but they are still valuable tools for learning. If we have never formally attended school, or have attended school but still feel that the tools for reading are not yet sound, we must quickly acquire the necessary tool knowledge so that we can read with convenience. As for things like paper, ink, brushes, inkstones, dictionaries, etc., those things are just tools of tools. (The End)

### Grain and Rice Prices Soar Like a Pagoda, Making Sustenance Difficult and Fearful; Speculators Dump and Hoard Like a Bouncing Ball, Creating Chaos in the Market; No. 1 Foreign Rice Still Hovers Around the 150 Yuan Mark

Surrounded by a speculative atmosphere, the market price of foreign rice rises and falls unpredictably. Price hikes and price cuts are used to the fullest extent of manipulation. However, the end result is a gradual upward trend. It rises today and rises again tomorrow, making everyone fear that sustenance will be difficult, worry about hunger, and face the threat of being forced to go without food. Yesterday, the agricultural market opened with a continuation of the afternoon's fatigued momentum. Everyone's spirits were low. General marketers believed that since the previous surge had been so intense, any setback would be difficult to reverse and would likely cause a drastic reaction. Therefore, they dared not take action and were all watching from the sidelines, waiting for an opportunity. However, speculators, whose only goal is speculation, dumped their holdings like a bouncing ball. Seeing that the environment was unfavorable and the market looked bad, they rushed to the market to take the lead. You sold cheap and I sold cheaper, with frequent competitive sales. Even wholesalers threw out large quantities of existing goods. At that time, the overall market situation was difficult to maintain. Prices fell like leaves swept away by the wind. By midday, before the closing price, the price of rice had suddenly dropped by three or four yuan. For example, No. 1 Saigon was only selling for 146 yuan, Xiaojiao for 137 yuan, and Suijian for 114 yuan. Who knew that the market was so changeable and the situation was so difficult to predict? Just as the situation was starting to change, new large speculators, with their abundant financial resources, exerted their broad influence, seizing the opportunity to absorb the goods on a large scale. As a result, the marketing forces also followed suit and started buying. Small speculators turned to playing a game of bouncing the ball, making small gains, creating a surge of momentum, and the market recovered. The sound of shouting high prices filled the market, and the prices of all kinds of foreign rice rose like climbing a pagoda, rising step by step. The market closed tight. The closing prices were: No. 1 Saigon 149 yuan, No. 2 143 yuan, No. 1 148 yuan, Huojiao 147 yuan 7 jiao, Min Dang 143 yuan, Haiphong Jian 144 yuan, Xiaojiao 141 yuan, Dongjian 133 yuan 5 jiao, Suijian 116 yuan Hujian 137-8 yuan. Looking at the above prices, they rose and fell alternately, coinciding with the recovery of the market, which can be described as a tight situation in the air. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, speculators both inside and outside the industry began to absorb and release prices, and No. 1 Saigon saw the highest price of 150 yuan again. Other types of rice also followed suit and increased by one or two yuan. Although the evening closing was not slightly lax, the people were still uneasy. Ying Company's No. 1 Saigon for early May delivery rose from 164 yuan to 166 yuan, then fell slightly to 164 yuan at noon, and rose again to 166 yuan in the afternoon, now 167-8 yuan. Xiaojiao was 164 yuan to 165.5 yuan, with futures at 161-2 yuan. Broken rice was currently 135-6 yuan, with futures at 133 yuan to 124.5 yuan, all with one or two yuan of increase and decrease. The daily transaction volume of existing rice was no less than 25,000 bags, and original bags were more than 15,000 bags.

The arrival of thick and thin japonica and glutinous rice is not abundant, and their sales channels are not as broad as those of foreign rice. Therefore, the market is often stagnant and does not change as flexibly and diversely as foreign rice. Yesterday, it remained in this state. From morning till evening, supply and demand were always equal. The prices were maintained and similar to the previous day. Xi Geng was still priced at 148 yuan, Su Geng was priced from 146 yuan to 143-4 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice was priced at 142-3 yuan, and the best glutinous rice was priced at 135 yuan, with ordinary glutinous rice at 133 yuan to 131 yuan. Ordinary glutinous rice was priced at 122-3 yuan.

A large quantity of Thai rice will arrive today. The Thai shipping company's Xishengtong ship is loaded with rice, approximately 30,000 bags, which is expected to arrive today and will be unloaded at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong. (Lease)

### Bargain-Priced Flour Increase Causes Customers and Speculators to Compete

The market situation for flour is similar to that of foreign rice, with prices rising steadily. After the sharp rise in white rice prices, customers became very interested in buying. Local marketers also took the opportunity to buy up foreign flour at low prices, sparing no effort, as bargain-priced flour had to be increased by three or four yuan. With customers and speculators competing to buy, the market gradually increased endlessly. The Gold Dragon brand and Kan flour were the most active, with market prices rising to 31.7-8 yuan and approaching the 32 yuan mark. Holders of the goods were unwilling to sell. Although the Flower Bird brand Australian flour was not as active as the Gold Dragon brand, the price was also raised to 32.1-2 yuan, and American brands were also priced at 32 yuan. Other miscellaneous brands followed suit and increased. According to discussions in the market, the cost of foreign goods is currently high, and newly arrived miscellaneous brands and Kan flour have mostly been re-exported, indicating optimism. However, the livelihoods of ordinary people will be affected, which is regrettable. There was little supply or demand for wheat, and there was no official market.

### Financial Foreign Exchange Short Covering Tightens, Then Returns to Level

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed exchange rates remained stable, and the British exchange rate was stable. The US dollar first tightened and then returned to level.

After 10 o'clock, the tightening stopped and returned to level. Chinese banks also had considerable selling interest. In the end, the closing prices of British and American exchange rates were the same as the previous day, and trading was dull. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

HSBC's listed exchange rates did not change, and the silver equilibrium tax was still 4.5%. Afterward, imported foreign firms bought May US dollars at 5.125 yuan from a certain bank, which was the tightest. Later, it was learned that HSBC was still supplying at 5.15625 yuan, and Chinese banks also released the dollars one after another. Speculative buying subsided, and the trend stabilized. In the end, both spot and May futures of British exchange rate were 0.371875, and US dollar were 5.15625, unchanged from the closing price of the previous day.

At the same time, it is also heard that American insurance companies will no longer be concerned about Japanese ships, which has little impact. All parties are enthusiastically purchasing. The yarn market has also been rising sharply in recent days, so in addition to factories promptly replenishing raw cotton, general traders and speculators are even more enthusiastic and purchasing in large quantities in order to compete. Therefore, there is no doubt that the future cotton market will see a lively development.

The New York cotton market is firm and rising due to the stability of Wall Street and the impact of the National Government possibly agreeing to a 75% loan. The market prices rose sharply due to active trading by speculators. As a result, the closing price was about 15 points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to slight replenishment by factories, but then fell due to the weakness of stocks and other market conditions, with all parties successively selling and understanding. The closing prices fell by varying amounts of 3-4 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market will be bullish by half a rupee.

### Piece Goods Speculation and Trading in Fabrics Becoming More Lively

Yesterday's market for factory-made cloth continued to rise, with fancy goods rising more. Greige cloth and fine twill rose by 5 to 7.5 jiao. Shenxin Factory's quoted price for Fugui fine cloth was 47.5 yuan, and Fuyu fine twill was 42.5 yuan. These were factory prices, and no orders were made publicly. Fine twill opened at 41 yuan on the market in the morning and rose to 41.75 yuan in the afternoon. Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Tongyi coarse cloth rose by 5 to 7.5 jiao per bolt. Over 1,000 pieces of various fabrics were traded on this street. The Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled over 300 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The Zhejiang and Fujian merchants handled over 100 pieces of colored cloth and coarse and fine cloth from the occupied areas of Xiamen and Dinghai. 815 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong in one day.

The Dongbu market is rising. However, sales of fine white cloth are still flat, and the price increase is not significant. The highest morning price at Longtou Xinzhan and others was 51.85 yuan, and the closing price was 51.75 yuan. Si Qun's serge continued to rise, and demand was exceptionally strong. The morning price was 1.61175 yuan, returning to 1.600875 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the soaring yarn prices, speculators pushed the price up again to 1.611 yuan.

### Woolen Goods Sales Turning Quiet

Sales of woolen goods have turned quiet recently. This is because it is between seasons. Summer and autumn goods have already been taken care of, and winter purchases are still early. In addition, since the Ningbo Incident and the outbreak of war, transportation by inland merchants has been suspended. In the occupied areas, it is difficult to obtain permits for people to transport goods, resulting in blocked roads. Therefore, most of the woolen goods merchants still rely on this street for the bulk of their business.

### Sugar Market Sugar Prices Rising Again

Yesterday's market was trending upwards. It was initially stable, but prices gradually rose due to special rumors. The association's quoted price for coarse white foreign warehouse spot goods rose 0.2 yuan to a public, unconcealed price of 104.2 to 104.5 yuan. For deliveries on the 10th of next month, the opening price was 104.8, 104.7, 104.6, and 104.5 yuan, then gradually rose to 104.8, 104.9, 105, 105.1, 104.95, 105.2, 105.3, 105.4, 105.8, and then to 106.5 yuan, an increase of 2.2 yuan. Taikoo's granulated white sugar B, western warehouse, was 108.5 yuan, and the eastern warehouse was 107.8 yuan, an increase of 3.7 yuan. D West Mark, western warehouse, was 101 yuan, HYX Mark warehouse, 98.8 yuan, eastern warehouse, 98.3 to 99.7 yuan, Dutch red sugar, 78 yuan.

### Coal Market Increase in Coal Dust Prices Intensifying

The prices of various grades of coal dust continue to rise, and the increase is becoming sharper and more intense. It is not affected by the tightness of funds at the end of the month. The market sentiment is rampant, and people expect higher prices. Yesterday, the trade association's price for Kaiping No. 2 dust was already quoted at 335 yuan, while the price for Jingshan dust was quoted at 320 yuan, and the price for coal dust was 315 yuan. When shipping from warehouses, traders are outside the line, and local merchants add a little extra margin.

### Seafood New Mushrooms Arriving, Pepper Prices Rise with Production

Old stocks of domestic mushrooms have long been exhausted. Although new goods from various places have appeared on the market, transportation is blocked, making it difficult for them to arrive. Recently, a small number have arrived by private ships. The price for Chuzhou goods is 1,050 yuan. The price for winter mushrooms from Dong goods is even higher, reaching 1,630 yuan. The market is very firm.

Pepper prices have risen due to increased production costs, making it difficult to set exchange rates.

Therefore, although shipments are small, market prices have also tightened. Yesterday, No. 1 pepper sold for 130 yuan, and black pepper for 128 yuan.

### The Fate of the Diamond Industry in Wartime Europe

— Nong

(4) Measures by the British Government

Diamonds are so valuable in the jewelry industry and so widely used in industry that the British government realized that unlimited diamond outflows were very detrimental to the country. Therefore, it initiated several measures to strictly prohibit the export of diamonds, whether for decorative or industrial purposes. This move was quite reasonable. A large reserve of diamonds in London would greatly help the national treasury during wartime. It knew that after a long war, the economic conditions of countries in the New World would definitely be far superior to those in Europe, so diamonds would be the most powerful tool for exchanging goods with the United States or any country! Large quantities of diamonds could be exchanged for food, gasoline, airplanes, cannons, or any kind of goods that the country lacked or needed!

### The City's Labor Community Warmly Celebrates Labor Day Today. Workers Enthusiastically Support National Policy. Concession Authorities Begin May Joint Defense.

Today is International Labor Day. The city's labor community is celebrating the holiday as usual and sending a telegram to Chairman Chiang to express their respect and to慰问 the soldiers on the front lines. The City Party Headquarters also issued a public announcement. The concession authorities in both concessions have begun a month of emergency preparedness starting today due to the numerous revolutionary anniversaries in May. The details are as follows:

City Workers Take Holiday to Celebrate

Today is International Labor Day, which is also the anniversary of the laboring workers' struggle for freedom and liberation and the completion of the "three-eight system" under the heavy oppression of capitalists. Therefore, workers all over the world warmly support this great holiday to show that they have not forgotten it. Although Chinese workers have not fully achieved the "three-eight system," they have gradually moved towards the path of liberation because of "May Day." On this day in 1888, the workers in Chicago, unable to bear the exploitation of capitalism, united and fought, and after great sacrifices, achieved a glorious victory. At a time when China's War of Resistance is reaching the eve of victory, it is also when the Chinese people are striving for independence, freedom, and liberation. The situation is similar to the Chicago workers' struggle for freedom, but its significance is thousands of times greater than the "three-eight system." Therefore, the entire city's people are enthusiastic and eager to unite the spirit of the military and industrial workers of the generations, be loyal to the Party and the country, and strive for victory. The city's workers feel the greatness of their heavy mission and are taking a day off as usual to celebrate this anniversary.

Telegram to Chairman Chiang to Express Respect

In order to celebrate "May Day," Labor Day, workers from all industries in the city jointly sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission yesterday, expressing their respect. The original text roughly stated: "To Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission in Chongqing. Time flies, and International Labor Day has arrived again. At this time, with frequent good news and the excitement of the country's victory, we are even more determined to strive for final victory. The workers of Shanghai have always supported your leadership, diligently followed the national policy, and will continue to uphold the 'May Day' spirit without the slightest懈怠. We send this telegram without delay, respectfully wishing you good health. The Preparatory Committee of Shanghai Workers from All Industries Celebrating International Labor Day, with official seal."

### Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign Concludes Yesterday

The city's Second Anti-Tuberculosis Campaign, which began on the 16th of last month, was jointly organized by major hospitals in Shanghai. It included free X-ray examinations and free sputum tests, as well as major pharmacies providing medicines to patients at low prices, which greatly benefited the citizens. The campaign lasted for two weeks and was declared closed yesterday according to the predetermined schedule. It is reported that due to the free nature of the examination, the hospitals were overcrowded, and a large number of people were turned away each day due to the limit being reached. The citizens' urgent need can be seen from this. At the same time, it also proves that although as many as 20 hospitals participated in the examination, the manpower and resources were still far from sufficient. It is deeply felt that there is still a need to expand relief efforts in the future.

### Mai Bian & Co. Shipping Coal to Shanghai. 50,000 Tons Shipped from North China, But No Impact on the Power Company.

According to the English "China Press", Mai Bian & Co. has agreed with the Japanese authorities to ship 50,000 tons of coal from North China to Shanghai, which is expected to alleviate the city's extremely critical coal shortage.

Anthracite Coal Only for Household Use

However, the Shanghai Electric Power Company is not affected by this, as it is all anthracite coal, while the power company uses bituminous coal. It is understood that Shanghai consumes approximately 170,000 tons of coal per month, with bituminous coal accounting for approximately 80% and anthracite coal accounting for the remainder. Therefore, Mai Bian & Co.'s shipment of anthracite coal to Shanghai will benefit apartment owners who can use it for household purposes. Shanghai's factories are rarely equipped to burn anthracite coal.

Hoping for Continued Coal Shipments

An employee of Mai Bian & Co. stated that they hope to agree with the Japanese side and continue to ship coal in the future. When the Shanghai Exploration & Development Company, which manages Mentougou coal, opened this morning (30th), the share price of Mentougou coal rose to 25.5 yuan after the news that the company had signed a new contract to ship Mentougou coal to Shanghai. It is understood that the face value of the company's shares is 2.5 taels, and the market price was only 19 yuan two weeks ago, rising sharply to 21.25 yuan last week.

### New Loans at the End of April

Of the loans that expired at the end of April this year, 70-80% of the old customers rolled over their loans. The factories that completed transactions accounted for approximately 6-7 million yuan, with interest rates ranging from 0.9% to 1.1%. The silk and cotton textile industry accounted for over 2 million yuan, the sugar and northern goods industry accounted for approximately 1 million yuan, and the department store and other industries accounted for approximately 3 million yuan. The highest interest rate for reverse repos was 1.2%, and the specific rate was determined based on the situation of each industry.

### The Provisional Board of Directors of the Municipal Council Will Hold Its Inaugural Meeting Today and Will Elect the Briton Li De'er as Chairman.

Danish Consul-General and Senior Consul Hill stated yesterday that the organization of the Provisional Board of Directors of the Municipal Council must obtain the consent of the National Government in Chongqing in accordance with the Yangjingbang Charter. However, in response to the request of the Consular Body and taxpayers, it will begin work immediately and hold its first meeting at 4:10 PM today. It is expected that British Director Li De'er will be elected as Chairman at that time, and Japanese Director Koji Moto will be the Deputy Chairman. When the reporter inquired about the opinions of Fei Hezaopu, the Chief of the Municipal Council, he said that he was one of the employees of the Municipal Council and could not express any opinion on this matter.

### Mrs. Xie Telegrams the Lone Army Barracks Requesting to Keep Memorial Relics. Several Thousand People Still Went to Offer Condolences Yesterday. Zhang Zhizhong and Niu Yongjian Teleographed to Comfort the Lone Army.

Since the remains of Xie Jinyuan, the commander of the Lone Army, were entombed in a tragic ceremony the day before yesterday, people from all walks of life continued to offer condolences and send wreaths and elegiac couplets yesterday to commemorate and admire Xie's glorious history during his lifetime. This shows the deep impression Xie made on the people of the isolated island. The memorial service is scheduled to be held on the 3rd of this month, and the preparations for various matters are largely complete. Mrs. Xie Ling Weicheng had a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, requesting to retain relics. Zhang Zhizhong, Niu Yongjian, and others have sent telegrams to express their condolences to Xie's family and to comfort all the soldiers in the Lone Army Barracks. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:

Various Circles Continue to Offer Condolences and Donations

Yesterday, from morning to night, people from all walks of life continued to go to the Lone Army to offer condolences and send wreaths, elegiac couplets, elegiac plaques, and mirror frames in an endless stream. In total, no less than four or five thousand pieces of wreaths, elegiac couplets, etc. were piled up in the camp. The condolences and designated donations for the construction of bronze statues from all walks of life in the past few days amounted to 6,296.25 yuan. In addition to those designated for the construction of bronze statues, the rest of the donations will be used for funeral expenses. If there is any surplus, a commemorative fund will be established separately. Yesterday afternoon, some students organized a "Loyal Service Team" and went to慰问 the Lone Army soldiers with white flags.

Preparations for the Memorial Service Completed

The preparations for the memorial service on the 3rd of this month have been largely completed. Regarding the matter of various groups receiving admission tickets, due to the notice from the Jing'an Police Department of the Municipal Council, it was decided that the Service Office would print 2,500 copies and hand them over to the Lone Army Barracks for distribution. Therefore, the following two points should be noted: (1) Various agencies, groups, and schools that have already received the mimeographed admission tickets from the Lone Army Barracks can go to the barracks from 1:00 PM today to exchange them for the admission tickets issued by the Civil Police Department. (2) Those who have not yet received them can send a letter to pick them up from 1:00 PM today. Each group representative is still limited to four people. One is willing to donate a white archway, and it has been decided that Li Kanghong, the nephew of Mr. Li from Hongcheng Equipment Store at No. 30, Lane 727, 700, North Tian Tong Road, will supervise the construction. Regarding how to build Xie's 坟墓, it is said that the camp is requesting instructions.

Mrs. Xie Requests to Retain Relics

Mrs. Xie Ling Weicheng sent a telegram from Jiaoling, Guangdong, stating to Senior Regiment Adjutant Shangguan of the Lone Army: "Duojian, Weicheng, please check and send back the relics of my husband, Jinyuan, for memorial purposes. I sincerely hope so. Ling Weicheng of Jiaoling County, Guangdong, respectfully叩陷". Also yesterday, the Lone Army Barracks received 慰问 telegrams from Zhang Zhizhong, Niu Yongjian, Wang Zhaohuai, etc., which will not be fully recorded.

The Four Murderers Will Be Prosecuted Today

According to the English "China Press," the four murderers who assassinated Xie Jinyuan, the commander of the Lone Army, on April 24th, will be formally prosecuted by the First Special Court tomorrow (1st). Today (30th), it was learned from the police that during the investigation, the four murderers remained tight-lipped about their motives for assassinating Commander Xie. When Xie's remains were entombed yesterday, Regiment Adjutant Shangguan Zhibiao, who was also stabbed and injured at the same time as Commander Xie, rushed to participate. In addition to the funeral, a memorial service will be held on May 3rd. Various related public groups in this city will be invited to participate.

### Japanese Troops in Zhoushan Transferred Elsewhere

According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to Shanghai-based groups from Zhejiang Province, (1) Regarding the battle on the Yuyao front, after the Chinese army recaptured Mazhu, the Japanese army retreated and gathered in the city, appearing to be withdrawing to Shushan. (2) The Chinese army crossing the river from Shangyu has recovered Dongguan Town. (3) The Ningbo Chinese army has now retreated to a certain place in the countryside to wait for an opportunity to strike. (4) Before landing on the coast of eastern Zhejiang, the Japanese army concentrated more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers in Zhoushan, who have now all been transferred elsewhere. (5) The Chinese army counterattacking on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has captured Fengqiao.

### After Persuasion from the French Concession Authorities, Cleaning Workers Resumed Work. The Method for Improving Treatment Will Be Decided Today. Business Owners Refuse Mediation, and the Situation Deteriorates.

More than 800 cleaning workers in the French Concession area went on strike on the 27th of this month due to the increasing cost of living in the city and their unsuccessful request for wage increases. As of yesterday, the strike had lasted for three days. It is learned that the labor unrest ended yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, after repeated persuasion from the Health Department of the French Municipal Council. However, there may be problems with the resumption of work for over 100 workers.

Treatment Issues for Cleaning Workers

The issue of improving treatment is now scheduled to be decided today by the Health Department of the French Concession. The White Russian workers hired after the strike were only paid 60+ yuan per month, so all workers hope to improve their treatment to maintain their livelihood. The 40+ workers arrested in Nanshi have also been released. It is also heard that someone mediated the labor unrest and agreed to a uniform wage increase of 30%. All the workers were satisfied and declared a resumption of work yesterday. Whether this is true remains to be seen with the facts of today.

According to the English "China Press," approximately 350 street sweepers in the Health Department of the Public Concession went on strike at one point yesterday afternoon (29th), and all of them have resumed work this morning (30th).

The Commercial Press Labor Unrest Deteriorates

At 2:00 PM yesterday, Lu Gaoyi reported the progress of negotiations with the management to the representatives of the union and the representatives of the distribution branch of the Commercial Press. The management had insisted on rejecting mediation. Lu also said that he had expressed to the management in his capacity as mediator that the environment was becoming increasingly difficult, and that both labor and management should make concessions to overcome the difficulties together. However, the management did not express an opinion. In addition to expressing gratitude to Lu, the labor representatives also said that during the mediation period, their colleagues had absolutely maintained order and had not taken any excessive actions. Regarding the various proposals made by the management, they were all based on the minimum living rate for workers issued by the Municipal Council. Employees have served the company for decades, and the request to obtain the treatment of a small worker seems to be reasonable. The labor side has always maintained a mild and sincere attitude, hoping that the company will consider their suffering and make a reasonable solution. From this, it can be seen that the labor side's sincerity is purely for life. The management's self-suspension of business and closure of factories, the authorities' evasion, and the rejection of mediation have left thousands of colleagues on the verge of destitution. It is heard that the representatives have convened an emergency meeting and are preparing steps, not hesitating to sacrifice tasks, to survive. If the situation expands and misfortune occurs, the responsibility lies entirely with the company. It is heard that Ms. Xing and Mr. Lu cannot bear to see the cultural institutions' labor and management turn into a fierce dispute and will make a final appeal in order to break the deadlock and find a way to continue mediation.

Mediators Will Make a Final Appeal

Tailai Employees Laid Off Yesterday Afternoon

More than 100 employees of Tailai Automobile Company were refused by the company authorities for their request to increase salaries by 30% to 50%, to calculate subsidies at 100% of the salary, and to cancel the rice subsidy, with the company distributing 6.5斗 of rice to each person or calculating cash subsidies accordingly. As a result, all employees of the company went on strike at 11:55 AM yesterday and resumed work at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. It is heard that during this short strike time, all of the company's cars were not dispatched, and the company was virtually paralyzed.

### Rumors Spreading That a South Ship Was Sold to Italy. British Deny the Matter. The Ship Has Hoisted the Italian Flag and the Garrison Has Withdrawn. However, There Are Many Disputes That Are Difficult to Resolve for a While.

Regarding the transfer of sovereignty and sale of the South 断拉夫 freighter Tomislav to the Italian Post Ship Company, responsible parties in this city called it an "obvious fabrication." Yesterday, it was rumored that the British might take action on this matter. At the same time, a Japanese official in this city stated that the Japanese side had not yet received formal notice of this new development and could not comment. However, according to Japanese sources, the reason for the previous protest by the Japanese naval authorities was the act of 水兵 boarding the ship by force. If the South government and the Italian government have a peaceful and legal agreement, then the Japanese authorities may consider this matter to have come to an end. According to the Italian Post Ship Company, this agreement was concluded between the Italian government and the newly established "Croat government." When reporters asked the Daxiang 洋行, the Shanghai agent of the ship, about the transfer, they replied that they had not received this report.

Rumored to Have Been Sold to the Italian Post Ship Company

According to the English "China Press," it was rumored that the South freighter Tomislav was "sold" to the Italian Post Ship Company yesterday (29th). Japanese naval authorities in this city now believe that the Italian side's seizure of the ship has come to an end. The Italian authorities also stated that after the Italian soldiers and 水巡捕房 policemen stationed on the ship withdrew, the matter was over. It is heard that the Italian soldiers withdrew after the Tomislav hoisted the Italian flag. Regarding this matter, the Italian authorities notified the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai yesterday. As for whether the transfer of the ship to the Italian side will be invalidated by other parties, it is currently unclear, but it is generally believed that the relevant parties will continue to negotiate with the port authorities.

Changing to the Italian Flag, Soldiers Retreat

The Shanghai Times reported that the South freighter Tomislav (5,300 tons) hoisted the Italian flag yesterday (29th) morning, and the Italian marines and 水卜捕房 policemen who had been armed "protecting" the ship for a week have all withdrawn, because the Consul-General stationed in Shanghai传 that the ship has been sold to the Italian Post Ship Company. This development has been confirmed by the port and the British consulate authorities, but the whole incident has not been resolved, and negotiations are in progress.

Complex Circumstances, Difficult to Resolve

Sources familiar with the matter speculate that the transfer of the Tomislav to the Italian side may be rejected by the relevant parties and deemed invalid. However, as the matter becomes more complicated, the possibility of the ship staying in the Huangpu River during the European war is also greater. Yesterday, all parties were silent about the new developments of the Tomislav. However, it is generally believed that the fault for the failure to resolve the matter lies with the Italian side, with the Italian flag in blue, white, and red已高高 hoisted on the ship's main mast. Today, the Italian side is firmly unwilling to give in, and is expected to realize its hope of having the ship idle in Shanghai Port and not allowing the British to lease it for business. It is heard that the details of the transfer of the Tomislav are being unilaterally negotiated in Europe, and the Italian Consulate-General has notified the port authorities of the ship's registration under the Italian flag.

### Parcels to Tianjin Must Fill in Detailed Forms

Yesterday, the Parcel Business Section of the Postal Administration issued a notice stating that from May 1st, the acceptance of large parcels to Guangzhou will be temporarily suspended. In order to facilitate the delivery of parcels to the receiving bureau, from now on, for all large parcels sent to Tianjin, the contents must be of the same type. If there are more than two types of items inside, a detailed form must be filled out separately and submitted to the bureau for posting. Merchants are advised to pay attention.

### Rice Weevils Cannot be Educated: Drastic Sanctions Should be Adopted; Black Market Wildly Raises Rice Prices; Rice Weevils' Crimes are Unforgivable

According to news from the Rice Industry Association, the French Concession authorities recently received a report that the market belonging to the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association at 15 Avenue Edouard VII is still secretly buying and selling rice beyond the limited amount. Recently, it has become even more rampant, wildly raising rice prices for no reason, so that the formal transaction of the rice market the next day is based on the market price, and the rice prices of each stall are getting higher and higher. Now, in order to eliminate the illegal transactions, the French Concession authorities have dispatched detectives to station in the market to monitor rice merchants' trading. Once it is discovered that anyone does not comply with the association's resolutions and privately engages in rice transactions in the afternoon every day, they will be arrested and prosecuted according to law.

Refusing to Sell

Hong Kong Rice

Widespread Indignation

The Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) decided to order 25,000 tons of rice from Hong Kong every month, which is 250,000 bags, to be shipped to Shanghai to stabilize rice prices. The council will be fully responsible for raising funds and renting ships. Since Shanghai needs 8,000 bags of rice per day, the total monthly amount is 240,000 bags. Now Hong Kong is willing to supply 250,000 bags per month, which is more than enough, and if Hong Kong has a shortage, it can increase the supply. It is estimated that the cost per dan (担) required, plus a 10% profit, will result in a selling price of 108 yuan, which can reduce the burden on civilians by 30 to 40 yuan compared to the current market price. The council originally intended to entrust the rice industry to retail at this price, but the rice industry refused outright and would not sell on consignment, because if sold at this price, their stockpiled rice would not be able to be hoarded for speculative purposes. The council then contacted rice shops, intending to directly entrust them to sell, but it is known that the rice industry is obstructing this, making this plan impossible to implement. After this news came out, all sectors were very indignant.

The Reasons for the

Two Associations' Refusal to Sell

Yesterday, we received a letter from the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association and the Bean and Rice Industry Association, which stated: "Dear Sirs, recently, regarding the matter of the Hong Kong government's representative consulting with the Shanghai Municipal Council on the purchase of Hong Kong rice, we were entrusted to purchase from the Hong Kong government representative group, and the Shanghai Municipal Council contacted the ships to facilitate loading. Our colleagues handling this purchase will have considerable profits to gain, which is beneficial to both the public and private sectors, and we would be happy to do so. However, since the current rice price is already very expensive, if the sale of Hong Kong rice is transferred through merchants, adding another layer of profit, it will only increase the cost. It would be better for rice shops to directly purchase and sell, so that poor households can receive more benefits. This is the result of our two associations' final consideration. Looking back at our original intention, we have no other intentions. We reported this to the authorities, hoping to be adopted, but reading the newspaper, there are misunderstandings. Now we record the resolutions of our two associations below to clarify the truth. The resolutions of that day were: 'This matter is originally strongly supported, but the current rice price is already very high. If more layers of profit are added, it will inevitably indirectly increase the burden on food households. It would be better for rice shops to directly purchase and sell, which is more appropriate. The representatives of this association should report this intention to the authorities.' We hope you will understand and grant us permission to publish this."

Foreign Newspaper's Comments on Drastic Sanctions

The local "North China Daily News" published an editorial attacking the crimes of Shanghai rice weevils, titled "Direct Action Should Be Taken on the Rice Market." The full text roughly stated that because of the excessive increase in rice prices in Shanghai, many shops feel overwhelmed, forming a serious threat to the law and order of the International Settlement, and it is regrettable that the Shanghai Municipal Council has been slow to take practical action against the bad rice merchants. The position of the Shanghai Municipal Council is very difficult, but today's situation is very different from the past. Today, the rice industry refuses to cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Council in promoting the sale of Hong Kong rice. These rice weevils have huge amounts of money, manipulating the Shanghai rice market, and do not care about public welfare. In the future, it is difficult to guarantee that the Shanghai Municipal Council's various plans will not be obstructed by these people. The Shanghai Municipal Council should adopt drastic sanctions. It is time to take action. These rice weevils cannot be educated and should not be tolerated. Their names should be announced to the public so that the evil merchants who have caused the high cost of living in Shanghai will be warned.

### Rumor of an Arrest in the Shooting of a Japanese Soldier Case; The Opening of the New Zha Gate Bridge and Wuzhen Road Bridge

According to the English "China Press," the Chinese suspect, Mr. A, who shot and wounded a Japanese sentry near the New Zha Gate Bridge on the night of April 27, was hiding in an uninhabited house in the Japanese military defense zone for about two days. This morning (April 30) at nearly 8 o'clock, he was discovered and arrested by the Japanese Marine Corps. Afterwards, the Japanese side re-opened the New Zha Gate Bridge and Wuzhen Road Bridge, allowing normal traffic. This morning, the Japanese authorities refused to disclose details of the captured suspect, only stating that they are still continuing their investigation.

### Manager of the China Press, Zhu Zuotong, Assassinated; Both Bullets Hit Vital Points and He Died Immediately

Zhu Zuotong, the manager of the "China Press," was 41 years old, from Wukang, Zhejiang. His family lived at 60 Rue Ferguson in the French Concession. Several years ago, Zhu took Liu Feifei as his concubine (formerly a dancer at the Grand Shanghai Ballroom) and rented a house at 5 Hongxing Lane, the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Beijing Road, living together in the rear room on the second floor. Last night, Zhu finished dinner at Liu Feifei's place and went out with Liu Feifei and her younger sister (however, according to another source, it was his legal wife). At that time, his car, number 6166, was parked at the entrance of Hongxing Lane waiting. As Zhu stepped out of the alley and was about to get into the car, a man suddenly flashed out from the roadside and opened fire with a pistol. One shot hit his head, the bullet entering from the back of the head and exiting from the front temple. Another bullet hit his left shoulder, penetrating his chest. He was seriously injured, falling into a pool of blood and dying on the spot. The shooter, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, fled into the crowd without a trace. Nearby Chinese constables arrived at the scene and reported to the police station in charge, which dispatched detectives to investigate. An ambulance was called to take Zhu Zuotong to Renji Hospital. After examination by doctors, it was determined that he could not be saved, and the body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination. At the time of the attack, Zhu was wearing a gray serge jacket and black satin shoes.

### Dinghai Zhenwu Association Distributes Relief Rice; 100 Bags Per Township

The Dinghai Fellow Villagers Association Zhenwu Committee raised a large sum of money in Shanghai at the beginning of the month and purchased a large quantity of miscellaneous grains, which were transported to Dinghai for sale and distribution at low prices. It is heard that the total amount of donations planned by the association is 170,000 yuan, and 130,000 yuan has now been raised. Therefore, it plans to continue fundraising in Shanghai. The second batch of relief supplies will also begin to be purchased soon, including three types: Xiaojiao rice, red sorghum, and corn. In addition to Xiaojiao rice being sold at low prices, red sorghum and corn are completely distributed as relief to save the poor. It is heard that the association has allocated 50 bags of Xiaojiao rice, 25 bags of red sorghum, and 25 bags of corn to each township.

### Returning from the Congee Kitchen (3)

— Liu

Most of the people eating congee are dressed in dirty clothes, but there are also many who are still neatly dressed. Among them are displaced vagrants; also many refugees who have fled and run out of money; and even more unemployed or working men and women who cannot get enough to eat in a day; plus those families who could have made a living, but now have a large number of mouths to feed and are suffering from the oppression of price manipulation and hoarding, so they have to show their faces and stand ashamed in the crowd waiting for food. According to the results of my random survey, some people came from Xujiahui Road, taking more than an hour to walk, and some came from Caojiadu, Zhabei, and Nanshi, getting up before dawn to catch this meal of congee. If you see them eating congee, they really don't waste a single grain of rice or a drop of congee soup. Sometimes, if the person distributing congee accidentally drips congee on the edge of the container, they will immediately scrape it off with their fingers and swallow it into their mouths with relish. The ladle for serving congee is made of copper (the old kitchen water ladle). Regardless of size, each person gets one ladle, and children in arms get half a ladle each. Therefore, even infants who cannot eat congee are willing to come, as they can get an extra half ladle of congee. Small children who can walk must be made to walk on the ground, so they can get an extra half ladle of congee (i.e., one ladle). This is exactly the opposite of the situation when buying train tickets. When buying train tickets, as long as you say the age is small, you can buy a half-price ticket. But now, to eat congee, as long as they can walk, they can eat a full serving of congee.

The weight of one ladle of congee is two catties and twelve taels by the city scale. Roughly, cooking rice into congee is in a ratio of one to eight, that is, one catty of rice can cook eight catties of congee. According to the current Cilian Association's congee distribution, 50 catties of broken rice are used every day, divided into three and a half large pots for cooking. Each pot uses about twelve dan of water. In the past, congee was cooked in separate pots using firewood. Now, it has been improved. A water-filled pot boiler is installed, with pipes connecting the hot air to the pots. Two pots can boil water at the same time in about 40 minutes. Then, the rice and wheat are mixed evenly and poured into the pots to cook for another 20 minutes to make congee. The thickness of the congee is such that a chopstick can be inserted without falling over. This is the proper way. The pot for cooking congee is a large round bucket made of fir wood planks, with a faucet installed underneath. The cooked congee is poured from the faucet into wooden buckets. Roughly, 250 catties of coal are used to cook congee every day. About 110 catties of dried radish are distributed. Congee distribution time is from 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM. The Chunshen Congee Kitchen, which was run by the Chinese Jisheng at the Vulcan Temple in Datongmen, Pushi, had roughly the same method and situation. There were also 5,000 people waiting for relief every day. However, due to funding, it is difficult to continue. It is said that an additional 500 yuan per day in subsidies would be enough to maintain it year-round. I said it is not difficult. There are countless wealthy people in Shanghai. As long as they skip one banquet or one social event, a 500 yuan donation is a very easy thing. However, although there are many wealthy people in Shanghai, they really don't know that there are such "unwise acts of kindness" in Shanghai, and they don't know that there are people who brave wind and rain, running twenty or thirty li to eat one bowl of congee. If they knew, unless they were numb, they would be moved, and a sense of benevolence would arise spontaneously. Perhaps it would be like "plucking a hair from a bull" to give the poor a few days of satiety. I went to visit the day before yesterday, and it turned out that a philanthropist, Mr. Gu, donated 500 yuan to distribute congee for one day to pray for his deceased daughter. This kind of prayer is much more meaningful than hiring monks and Taoists to chant scriptures and perform rituals. It is also unnecessary to make a big show and extravagant display on one's birthday. Doing good deeds requires one to put in the effort oneself, without relying on others. If everyone puts in such effort, the congee distribution in both Shanghai can not only be maintained, but also expanded in scope, and it would not be difficult to save the people currently in the sea of suffering. Therefore, I only hope that everyone will have a good heart. When spending money, think about it, that is the direct route from this shore to the other shore. The savior of the poor people in Shanghai has arrived! (The End)

### Merger of Boiled Water Associations

The more than 500 "tiger stoves" (老虎灶 - traditional Chinese water boilers) in this city originally had two trade association organizations, the Hot Water Shop Association and the Hot Water Industry Association. They are now merged from today, and Ji Jianming, Zhang Delong, Mao Yongtang, Ye Hanjun, and Yu Jingyu have been publicly elected as standing committee members to be fully responsible for association affairs. A copy of the merger announcement of the two associations is transcribed below: "In order to seek the welfare of colleagues, this association has resolved through a joint meeting to merge the two associations from today, named the Shanghai Hot Water Shop Industry Association, in order to comply with the law and benefit association affairs. Colleagues in the city are hereby informed and requested to take note."

### Increase in Noodles Price

Fuxin Flour Mill in this city, in order to regulate the flour market, has continued to supply low-priced flour since March 8, with 5.873 bags per day, at a factory price of 25 yuan per bag, until 250,000 bags are sold out. It is now learned that the above-mentioned amount allowed for sale has been reached. In total, from March 10 (Monday) to April 29 (Tuesday), 307.766 bags of low-priced flour were issued. In addition to the 250,000 bags supplied by the Fuxin Factory, the additional 57.766 bags were made up by taking 10% of the imported foreign flour and issuing it in equal amounts. From March 8 to April 30, a total of 85.932 bags of foreign flour were received. After deducting the above-mentioned offset amount, there are currently 28.170 bags remaining, which are planned to be transferred to this month for issuance to make up for the shortfall in the amount of flour in this street. As for the accounts of the Low-Priced Flour Committee, they will be announced after being audited by a comptroller.

Low-Priced Flour

29 Yuan Per Bag

It is also learned that as a result of negotiations between the Fuxin Factory and the Shanghai Municipal Council, it has agreed to continue to supply 5873 bags of low-priced flour per day (excluding Sundays) from today, until 300,000 bags are sold out. However, due to the increased cost of foreign wheat and the increased cost of flour, the price of the above-mentioned flour is planned to be increased to 29 yuan per bag, plus a handling fee of 5 jiao per bag for the flour shops. However, judging from the current market price, it is still low. From May 1, users can collect flour at the original flour shops according to the amount they should receive (a total of 8.28 bags per day) on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, paying a price of 29 yuan and 5 jiao per bag. As for the flour shop handling fee, it was originally 3 jiao, but due to increased transportation costs and other expenses, the above-mentioned handling fee has to be appropriately increased to supplement the cost.

Sliced Noodles

6 Jiao 4 Fen Per Jin (斤 - unit of weight)

A reporter from "New Voice News" learned from the Machine-Made Sliced Noodle Industry Association that the association sent representatives Xue Lugen, Hai Donghai, Wang Fuxin, Zhu Zhen, and others to visit Deputy Chief Inspector Hoadley of the Shanghai Municipal Council this morning at 10:00 AM. At that time, Hoadley had not yet arrived at the office, so Secretaries May and Hsu received them on his behalf. Xue and others put forward the following two points: (1) Please request the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills to continue to sell low-priced flour. (2) Due to increased costs, it is planned to increase the price of sliced noodles by 9 fen per jin from today. Secretaries May and Hsu accepted this and agreed to increase the price of sliced noodles by 9 fen per jin, and promised that low-priced flour could continue to be sold tomorrow (today). The representatives then bid farewell and convened a meeting of member representatives yesterday to report on the progress of the visit to the authorities and the quantity of low-priced flour that each association should purchase. Today, the price of sliced noodles has risen to 6 jiao 4 fen per jin.

### Rice Merchant Excessively Indulgent, Body Weakened, Died Suddenly; Took Medication, Returned Home, Died in a Cart; A Passenger on a Public Bus Also Died Suddenly

Zhang Qiutao, a native of Jiading, 36 years old, was a rice merchant. He was already married in his hometown. Four years ago, he met Lu Mingjiao, a "guided woman," through a certain guide, and lived with her at 11, Lane 253, Rue Massenet. Recently, Zhang was excessively indulgent, resulting in

### Inventor

— Xiao Yun

Can you guess how many inventors there are in the United States? Last year alone, there were 42,248 new inventions patented at the U.S. Patent Office.

From 1836 to the end of last year, there were a total of 2,227,417 patents in the United States.

The sheer number may surprise you, but that is indeed the case.

There is only one Edison, and only one Marconi. They are very enviable, and they have already made a name for themselves. Their contributions to mankind are certainly great. But the world as it is today is not entirely the work of a few of them. Besides them, there are thousands upon thousands of anonymous scientists, working diligently in laboratories, using their energy and sweat to help create the world we have today.

(Editor's Note: From today onwards, we will introduce some new overseas inventions in "Free Talk." Please pay attention.)

### Trends and Me

— Bai Lian

A good friend said that I was too out of touch with the times, too conservative. So I asked her, "What does that mean?" She said, "Oh! You don't even understand this? Being out of touch with the times means being outdated! Being outdated means regressing; do you understand?" Then I suddenly understood. She was saying that I was a regressive person. Gradually, everyone became distant; I don't know if it was because she disdained to associate with outdated, regressive, and out-of-touch people, or if she was just too busy with her social life. I really didn't see her easily.

Friendship is like sailing against the current; if you don't advance, you retreat. Many onlookers wondered: "These two were good friends! What happened?"

I didn't know how to answer, but I thought to myself: maybe I am outdated, maybe others are. Behind my back, they also said I barely kept up with trends, but she was a good friend, so she told me directly and frankly.

Because my father and brothers wouldn't allow it financially, I couldn't continue my education. At home, I helped my mother with household chores, and in my spare time, I focused on magazines, newspapers, novels, books, writing, painting, music, various scientific knowledge, and indoor and outdoor activities, all of which I loved. Only mathematics disappointed me, and it was my greatest regret. My good friend sympathized with all of the above. However, I love cooking, and my living environment makes me that way. In my spare time, I also do tailoring for my younger siblings, whether it's knitting woolen yarn, or clothes, or shoes and socks, I learn to do them. These things, however, I didn't easily get her sympathy, and instead made her shake her head at me: "Oh! Another one returning to the kitchen to be a good wife and mother!" Is society unable to use me? Can you blame me for being outdated?

My friend is a complete movie fan. Her time and money allow her to go to the movies, and she always watches first-run or second-run foreign films. She especially admires those dancers who twist and sway their waists, and squeeze their flirtatious eyes, while I only criticize them with four words: "bizarre shapes and strange forms." She didn't say anything for a long time, stunned with anger, but I spoke first: "Don't be angry, I don't understand this at all." That's how we avoided a falling out. But now that I think about it, maybe this is one of the things that makes me out of touch with trends!

She often looked at my bangs and braids, and I didn't know if it was disappointment or pity, or what, but she always said, "It's a little too old-fashioned!" I heard it so many times that sometimes, knowing she was about to say it, I would first stroke my braids and say, "My braids, my bangs; old-fashioned!" After saying that, I couldn't help but laugh. She would immediately reply, "No! It's Eastern beauty!" "But, I only deserve such an old-fashioned look…" "No! Eastern beauty!" So I quickly changed the subject to avoid making everyone uncomfortable. I don't know if my being outdated has anything to do with my braids and bangs, why is she dissatisfied because of this? It's really strange, her permed and curled sideburns are a brand new style, the most popular, which really makes me unable to keep up! I'm definitely regressing, outdated. My hands, needless to say, if anyone saw them, they would say, "So rough!" My mother also sighed at my hands, "Oh! I pity you, your hands have become so rough," and they even have chilblains. So many things have to be done by hand! Is this also worthy of contempt? Of course, they can't compare to her hands that can be used in advertising shots, their skin is so white, so tender, so fine, and so soft, moreover, the ten fingertips are slender, and the nails are painted with bright red nail polish, making them even more white and red, beautiful and moving. And I would never dream of having such lovable hands!

She likes dancing and loves excitement, but I don't like them. I will never force a smile just because others are laughing. Especially joking, I will never force a smile for this kind of meaningless laughter; therefore, she criticizes me for not having any feelings, in fact, I am conserving my feelings. Therefore, I am an unamusing person. Take gambling, for example, I don't like it at all. Because I don't want to win other people's money, and I don't want others to lose money, so in this kind of situation, I am also unamusing, and not joining in the fun, it seems like I don't get along with anyone. I'm only a little over eleven years old, and I'm a bit like an antique, I don't know if I should blame the trend or blame myself.

Once, we talked about love, marriage, and boyfriends.

She advocates that love should not be restricted by anything, but I believe that this will lead to a lot of trouble. She advocates that love doesn't have to be for the sake of marriage. But I object to that. And she also said that she just wants to enjoy herself, so we each go our own way. My path may be lonely, while she is intoxicating others and also letting herself be intoxicated. She weaves herself into poems, making herself the moving protagonist, touching herself and those who applaud her, but gaining my antipathy.

I'm always wondering: what is this trend she's talking about? If the trend is her behavior, then I would rather remain the same and never join the trend.

### ### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(7) A Cross Drawn on the Face

But in less than five minutes, the most terrible thing appeared before his eyes. It was a bloody and mangled human body, stiffly lying flat on a door panel, carried by two people, step by step, out of the moon gate. Despite the bloodstains covering her head and face, Begonia immediately recognized her body and clothing as the mute girl he had parted with less than four hours ago.

"Ah—!" He tried desperately to rush out and ask what happened, but instead, he fainted next to a square table.

When he regained consciousness, he found his body tightly bound to a osmanthus tree in the courtyard. Standing before him was Ji Zhaoxiong, head held high, hands on his hips, his triangular eyes revealing an unspeakable look of triumph. Yuan Baofan sat on a wicker chair next to him, his upper garment open, revealing a large, coarse, and dark patch of fat, constantly cursing, "Damn it," "Bastard," "Son of a bitch"... his anger clearly had not subsided.

Several servants and an old nanny stood scattered behind Yuan Baofan.

"Damn that mute! She died so easily, now there's no one to confront this brat!" Yuan Baofan said through gritted teeth.

"But, Great Marshal," Ji Zhaoxiong immediately turned around, bowing slightly, "Even if that picture and the frame are evidence, just the fact that this kid fainted when he saw the girl's body shows how deeply moved he was. Great Marshal, you can understand what happened!" (95)

### ### Rocket Bomb

— Li Yi

A scientist named Fisher in West Springfield, Massachusetts, USA, has invented a "rocket bomb" that can travel straight up at a high speed of 900 miles per hour, guided by the sound of an airplane, and destroy enemy aircraft in the sky. This "rocket bomb" contains a magnetic controller that can track the sound waves emitted by an aircraft engine and explode with great force. Engineers of the War Department are very interested in this new weapon and are conducting secret tests on a remote and uninhabited island off the coast of New England.

Education

### ### Being a Daughter-in-Law is Hard

— Su Cao

In old-style large families, being a daughter-in-law was the hardest thing. But now, being a teacher in a private elementary school is just as hard as being a daughter-in-law, maybe even harder.

The principal's face is perpetually stern, just like a stereotypical mother-in-law. If there is any negligence in your duties, or anything you do that doesn't meet the mother-in-law's approval, you will be scolded or ridiculed.

The students' parents are like the great-grandparents. The parents' opinions are law, even the principal must obey them. As a granddaughter-in-law, of course you should obey them even more. But, unfortunately, the great-grandparents always have different opinions: "The grandfather says the grandfather has a point, the grandmother says the grandmother has a point." If you obey the grandfather, you will inevitably offend the grandmother; if you obey the grandmother, you might offend the grandfather. It's really hard to know what to do.

The students are like your own children, but unfortunately, they are spoiled by the grandmother. If you discipline them too strictly, the grandmother will come to defend her grandchildren, saying that you shouldn't be so harsh. If you let them be, the mother-in-law will say that you don't know how to discipline them. The great-grandparents are always nagging, too. It's bad to be too strict, and it's bad to be too lenient. "Those who are spoiled are blind," and the great-grandparents are mostly like the "Old Ancestor" Jia Mu in the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber"—unreasonable, which really makes things difficult.

The colleagues at school are like sisters-in-law. Some are good at flattery and win the mother-in-law's favor, so you have to be careful not to offend them. Some have a personal relationship with the principal, and they are like the younger sisters and brothers-in-law. They are the most likely to badmouth their sister-in-law to their mother, trying to make their mother dislike her. You have to guard against them while also flattering them. Otherwise, disaster may strike you from the sky.

In this situation, the only thing you can rely on is to have a powerful husband—the introducer. If your husband has passed away, or if your husband has no power or influence, and is weak and useless, then you will surely be bullied by everyone.

A daughter-in-law who is not good at dealing with people, and who has a mediocre husband, will find it hard to survive in such a large family, even if she works diligently and single-mindedly.

### ### Introducing Factory Cinemas

— Xin Ying

Today is Labor Day, and I want to talk about factory cinemas. In European and American countries, all factories of considerable size have movie theaters inside the factory. On Sundays or holidays, they show movies, and all factory workers and their families can enter for free.

There are, of course, reasons why major factories want to set up cinemas. The main goal is to enable all workers in the factory to see movies without spending money, to recover from work fatigue, and to obtain proper entertainment. Otherwise, going to the movies would cost money, and not everyone would go, and some would even seek out improper entertainment. As for using movies to instill worker education, to improve worker efficiency, and to increase worker's general knowledge, these are the original intentions behind the establishment of factory cinemas.

Because they contain the meaning of educating workers, the movies shown in factory cinemas are different from those in ordinary cinemas. In terms of subject matter, in addition to some entertainment films, they focus on the use of new machines, fire prevention, first aid methods, etc. In other words, they emphasize films that increase work efficiency and reduce worker danger.

These films are regularly shown in factory cinemas, giving every worker the opportunity to watch them. On the surface, it is to increase worker benefits, but in reality, it is still to increase worker productivity. Therefore, the biggest beneficiaries are still the factories. According to large factories in Europe and the United States, since the establishment of factory cinemas, they have achieved very good results. It's a pity that in Chinese factories, there are very few of these facilities.

### ### Notes on Watching "Leaving the Box"

— Ni Qiuping

Yesterday, I went with a friend to the Golden Theater to see Liu Dahong perform "Beating the Staff and Leaving the Box." His singing style is generally based on that of Shu Yan, and the recitative is also similar. I was more than ten rows away, but I could still hear clearly, which shows that skill is more important than talent. Even if his natural voice is not good, with skill, he can still be heard from afar. His entrance as a woodcutter, the beard, the water sleeves, the hand, body, and footwork are all very skillful. Ai Shiju is also not weak. When he was causing trouble in the government office, he did not kick his shoes accurately, but the "hanging hair" (吊毛) was very good. His crazed and foolish expression was quite good. His posture was not messy, and he had the temperament of a scholar. The slow tune in the study was too fast, probably because he didn't have enough breath. When he left the box, the constables played by Liu Binkun and Ai Shiju were perfectly matched. Binkun's skill is naturally top-notch, and he did it effortlessly, with the ease of lifting heavy weights. This play is a civil play sung with a military style, which is a difficult task for male roles. Now that Mr. Liu performs it, it is orderly and well-organized, showing great skill. Overall, his posture and expression were the best, followed by his singing. In the encore was the "Spring Ritual" by the host of the Songling Pavilion, which was purely of the Mei style. It is said that she is a strong amateur qingyi. "Pavilion Host" is her pseudonym. Now that Mr. Mei and Mr. Yu have announced their retirement, I was able to hear the remnants of the two schools in one night. The drawing of the cake is not enough to satisfy hunger, but looking at the plums can still quench thirst.

### ### New Entertainment News

— Xin Juan

### ### Ten Archetypes on the Hollywood Screen

— Hui Lin

The acting skills of Hollywood male actors on the screen can become different archetypes. Let's roughly divide these archetypes into ten types:

(1) The rugged type: Wallace Beery, Akim Tamiroff, Victor McLaglen, and Guinn Williams, etc.

(2) The delicate type: represented by Lionel Barrymore, Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, and Robert Donat, etc.

(3) The heroic type: Errol Flynn, Johnny Weissmuller, Jon Hall, and James Cagney are the most suitable.

(4) The sincere type: Fredric March, Leslie Howard, Paul O'Brien, and James Stewart.

(5) The dignified type: Donald Crisp, Edward Arnold, C. Aubrey Smith, and Claude Rains are the representatives.

(6) The profound type: Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, Raymond Massey, Paul Muni.

(7) The gloomy type: Basil Rathbone, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre, Karloff, and Lugosi are the most suitable.

(8) The strong and gentle type: represented by Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, George Brent, and Franchot Tone.

(10) The affectionate type: Ronald Colman, Melvyn Douglas, Nelson Eddy, and Charles Boyer, Cary Grant, Ray Milland, Don Ameche, etc. are all included.

Although some of the above ten types of acting can be combined or cannot be divided too strictly, the general situation is very clear. However, in fact, there are more than ten types, at least two more types can be added: the comedic and the riotous, but we understand how all-encompassing and diverse Hollywood's film art is.

Chapter 7: How Confused is the Attack on the City and the Killing of Generals?

The Tong siblings were originally demon kings who killed without blinking an eye, but after being influenced by Li Xin, their temperament also changed a lot. Hearing about foreign insults and invasions, there were always people with loyalty and ambition. Li Xin also made two large red flags for Red Maid, each embroidered with very large gold characters, "Red Maid." He also compiled a small team of rattan shield soldiers, all wearing red uniforms, about twenty people, all of whom were selected strong women, called the Maid Army. Li Xin and others deployed everything on the mountain, and the provincial capital received the news that Qixian had been captured. The high officials thought that the bandits were so rampant that they could no longer pretend to be deaf and dumb, so they sent a participating general named Wu to lead a thousand soldiers to attack Green Stone Mountain. Li Xin and the Tong siblings heard of it and prepared for it day and night, guarding the two passes strictly. When the government troops came, Li Xin and Red Maid went down the mountain to meet the enemy. The Green Stone Mountain men all fought to the death, and Red Maid was extremely brave, and Li Xin's command was effective, and they killed the government troops and defeated them. Red Maid raised the big red flag and led the Maid Army to pursue the defeated soldiers, and wherever they went, they were invincible. The government troops were afraid when they saw her figure, and they fled when they saw the red flag. After this battle, Red Maid's fame became even greater. The high officials in the provincial capital saw that few of the thousand government soldiers had survived, and Participating General Wu had been seriously injured and committed suicide out of fear of punishment. They knew that the bandits on Green Stone Mountain were not to be trifled with, and they did not dare to underestimate them, so they had to sit back and watch them grow stronger. Although Li Xin and Red Maid occupied the mountains and forests, and were heroes in one place, and they had a deep love for each other, and lived in happiness every day, they often thought of the three sworn brothers Xu Jing, Zhang Cangqiu, and Chen Fei. Zhang and Chen were both outside the pass, had they made achievements? And Xu Jing had gone to Daizhou, probably with the help of his uncle Wang Yongtai, he had already joined General Zhou Yuji's command. It was a pity that they were floating and wandering, living in different places, and they could not know the details of each other. They probably didn't know that he had become a green forest hero on Green Stone Mountain. (52)

### ### Summary of the Philosophy of Striving

— Zong Yu

People must recognize the purpose of life. The first is to be a thorough and authentic person, the second is to promote the spirit of serving society, and the third is to realize the ideal life. Only when all three can be achieved can one be said to have recognized the purpose of life.

### ### An Attempt at National Pronunciation Storytelling

— Du Liang

Storytelling is a mixture of "Suzhou dialect" and "Central Plains accent," the former is used for "narration" and "interjections," or the dialogue of comedic characters. The latter is used for the dialogue of general characters, and "storytelling." Since Ma Rufei monopolized the field, storytelling has had an independent position. To put it higher, it can be compared to "narrative poetry," and to put it lower, it is not inferior to "drum lyrics."

Using storytelling in movies, this time Golden Star's "Fig" is the pioneer. At that time, Bai Hong, the lead actress in the storytelling, expressed doubts, thinking that singing in movies must use the national pronunciation in order to be widely understood, and whether storytelling could use the national pronunciation was a problem. Later, after many people's discussion, it was believed that the "Central Plains accent" was originally very close to the national pronunciation, and this attempt would not fail. So Bai Hong spent a lot of effort studying it, singing "Hua Mulan," "Burying Jade," and "Remembering Lyrics" in "Fig." On the one hand, she relied on her God-given voice, and on the other hand, she relied on her intelligence. That kind of "lingering interest" was more than that of ordinary female storytellers.

If national pronunciation storytelling can be promoted smoothly, it may not be an improvement of local songs, or it may be possible to expand its field even more.

### ### "Hong Xuanjiao" to be Restaged This Month

— Xing

The China Travel Troupe's performance of "Hong Xuanjiao" at the Lyceum Theatre for nine days, a total of ten performances, earned more than 20,000 yuan. Although it was not profitable, the reputation and business were both good, and the actors' morale was unprecedentedly high. However, due to the contract, it was impossible to continue. Now it is heard that the China Travel Troupe authorities have negotiated a contract for next month with the Lyceum Theatre. If they can give up a period of more than a week, then "Hong Xuanjiao" will definitely be restaged in the same place starting this month. Otherwise, they may negotiate with the Carlton Theatre, because Zhou Xinfang is in urgent need of recuperation, and it seems that there is a possibility of renting it out.

### ### Small Records of Liyuan Figures

— Zhang Woping Zhang, a person from the North and South

Preface

"Peking Opera" is the quintessence of Chinese art and has always been supported by most people. The popularity of "Yue Opera," "Shanghai Opera," and other miscellaneous arts is temporary (the decline of the "Bangbang Opera" is an example), but the "popularity" of "Peking Opera" can "last for hundreds of years without decline." It is so now, and it will definitely be so in the future.

In recent years, many drama schools have been established in the north and south, and there are many talents in the Liyuan industry. This "Small Records of Liyuan Figures" is to select forty of them who are "models" to make small biographies. Those who have "passed away are not discussed."

The full text has a total of forty articles, published every Wednesday and Saturday, twice a week, and the entire series will be published in twenty weeks. As for the order of narration, it is nothing more than random, and there is no intention of "ranking before and after Lu."

The recorded figures are limited to male actors. Female artists will be left for another article in the future, not because of any discrimination. We do not want to "seriously" write biographies for Liyuan figures. There are countless talented people in the opera world, and omissions are unavoidable.
