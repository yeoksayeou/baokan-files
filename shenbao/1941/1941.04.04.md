### Butler Informs Shigemitsu: Close Anglo-American Cooperation to Aid China; Roosevelt to Announce Implementation of Lend-Lease; No Possibility of Reconciliation with Japan Regarding British Actions

Stockholm: British Foreign Under-Secretary Butler stated yesterday in the House of Commons that Britain and America have closely cooperated to aid China and have notified Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu of this matter. (Reuters, 3rd)

Washington: President Roosevelt's promise of further aid to China at the White House press dinner has yet to show signs of implementation. However, it is expected that an announcement will be made soon, and there is no doubt that China will receive American aid early to cope with its military difficulties. As the European situation may cause the United States to pay more attention to China, economic aid will be given priority. The reports in various newspapers here, with much attention, regarding Chairman Chiang's report at the opening of the Eighth Plenary Session, stating that 70% of China's difficulties are economic and 30% are military, evidently matches the views held by the authorities here. It is said that Mr. Currie, the President's most trusted economic advisor, who recently inspected the free areas of China and wrote a report, is currently under active consideration by the authorities.

London: British Foreign Under-Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons tonight that the British government has been watching the Japanese government's attitude towards the rights and interests of foreigners in China and the impact on British trade for some time. Recently, he took this opportunity to call the attention of the Japanese Ambassador to the current situation. The British government feels that this situation is inconsistent with the Japanese government's statements regarding upholding the Open Door policy. Conservative Party member Milner asked whether it is correct to determine that Japan has now violated all its promises regarding the rights and interests of enemies. Butler replied, "On the one hand, we have the statements of the Japanese government, and on the other hand, we have the situation currently developing. The Japanese side claims that its policy has not changed, but the more we pay attention to this situation, the more unsatisfactory it becomes. This is the reason why we took this opportunity to call it to the attention of the Japanese government." (Reuters, 3rd)

London: British Foreign Under-Secretary Butler stated yesterday in the House of Commons that Japan's Open Door policy in China is becoming increasingly unfavorable. He recently called the attention of Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu to this situation, saying, "The British government feels that there is no possibility of reconciliation with Japan's previous protests regarding the Open Door policy in China." Someone asked Butler whether it could be assumed that Japan would once again abide by the various treaties regarding the interests of European countries in China. Butler replied, "Japan issues declarations on the one hand, but on the other hand, there is the evolution of the current situation. Japan's declarations claim that its policy has not changed, but the more one examines the situation, the more one finds it deteriorating. Therefore, it is necessary to urge the Japanese government to pay attention." Someone also asked whether this was being done in cooperation with the United States. He said, "The government is handling matters appropriately." (Associated Press, 3rd)

### Anglo-American Far East Military Leaders Held Meeting in Philippines Yesterday

Formal Naval and Army Conference to be Held in Cavite. Unofficial Navy Designation, Marshal Brooke-Popham is an Expert in the Air Force, They Believe

Manila: British and American naval and army authorities will continue to hold meetings here today as the most practical action for strengthening British and American defenses in the Far East. British Far East Forces Commander Marshal Brooke-Popham, American Army Philippine Department Commander Major General Grunert, and American High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre will meet this morning. The conversation of Marshal Brooke-Popham after the meeting will be extremely important because of the recent strengthening of the American naval, army, and air forces in Manila and the accelerated construction of air force bases in the Pacific. This meeting is the first real contact between the leaders of the British and American defense forces in the Pacific. Observers predict that British and American authorities will discuss the possibility of the United States using Singapore. Once Japan implements its southward advance and the United States is drawn into wartime, there will be a joint policy of the British, American, and Dutch navies. It is not yet known whether Marshal Brooke-Popham will attend the meeting in Cavite. (Associated Press, 3rd)

Manila: When the British and American Far East naval and army leaders met here this morning, 27 elite American Army fighter planes flew in formation over Manila. (Associated Press, 3rd)

Manila: Tonight, officials here will discuss at a banquet hosted by senior officials in the Philippines the implementation methods for naval and air force cooperation in the event of war in the Pacific. Washington and London have both agreed. The guests invited by American official Sayre in the Philippines are only British Far East Forces Commander Brooke-Popham, American Asiatic Fleet Commander Hart, and American Army Commander in the Philippines Lieutenant General Grunert. Brooke-Popham refused to comment on what he and the Americans had discussed, and American naval and army officials also remained silent. It is said that Brooke-Popham will go to Hong Kong tomorrow and this morning visited Fort McKinley with Lieutenant General Grunert. (Associated Press, 3rd)

Washington: Well-informed sources believe that British Far East Commander Brooke-Popham's visit to Manila is part of a general plan for cooperation in the Pacific. It is believed that Brooke-Popham's visit to the Dutch East Indies further demonstrates British and American attention to the Pacific region. Some observers believe that Brooke-Popham's visit to Manila, coinciding with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Berlin and Rome, is a sign of increased British and American strength to cope with the increasingly intensified cooperation of the Axis powers.

When passing near Lingsi Village, they were ambushed by Chinese troops and retreated. (2nd)

Changde: A certain unit of the Chinese army on the north bank set up an ambush near Tailor Shop on the 29th of last month, intercepting the Japanese soldiers and Japanese trucks advancing from Shilipu. After fighting for four hours, nine Japanese trucks were destroyed and many Japanese officers and soldiers were killed. They also seized a Japanese light machine gun, dozens of rifles, multiple pistols, and many documents. (3rd)

Chongqing: Military news: (1) After the Chinese army retook Gao'an, the war situation in northern Jiangxi has returned to the situation before the 15th. (2) The Japanese army in northern Jiangxi abandoned many guns and weapons in the rivers. The Chinese army is trying to salvage them.

### Jiangxi Chinese Army Wins a Great Victory

Chongqing: A spokesman for the Chinese army announced today that the Chinese army has won the biggest victory in recent months on the battlefield southwest of Nanchang. 56,000 Japanese troops participating in the offensive in northern Jiangxi were not strongly resisted by the Chinese army, allowing the Japanese troops to penetrate deeply, and then cutting off the two wings of the Japanese army and repelling their columns. At the same time, the main column of the Japanese army was surrounded. The Japanese army advanced westward in three routes. Although the two wings of the Japanese army were defeated, the central route continued to advance vigorously. Usually, the Japanese army would not take risks. This time, it was obviously imitating the German blitzkrieg offensive, advancing regardless of everything, and relying on airplanes and motorized units to maintain supply. However, when the Japanese army reached Shanggao, the Chinese army intensified the encirclement. (Associated Press, 3rd)

### Belgian Ambassador Arrives in Chongqing from Hong Kong; Foreign Ministry Personnel Welcome at the Airport, to Visit Central Leaders Soon

Since the outbreak of the war, he came to Chongqing in the winter of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939) and stayed for more than a month. Last spring, he originally planned to come to Chongqing from Peiping again. Because the European situation was tense and the situation on the Western Front took a sharp turn for the worse, he had to postpone his plan to come to Chongqing. After arriving in Chongqing today, Ambassador Ryckman felt the vibrant spirit of the wartime capital and its rapid progress, and expressed his admiration. It is said that he will soon visit Foreign Minister Wang, Vice Minister Xu, and other officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as government officials, and plans to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang.

Editorial

### Children Are Innocent

Today is Children's Day, a modern holiday, Chinese, and transcending national boundaries to be international.

The international community of the future will inevitably be that of modern children, and the China of the future will inevitably be that of modern Chinese children; in short, everything of the future, whether responsibility, enjoyment, tears or laughter, love and hatred, the historical and cultural traditions and heritage, the possible new discoveries in the universe, and the possible new inventions in science, all belong to modern children. But in the modern era, it is still the modern era of adults; even everything related to children is still tied to modern adults, and must still be said to modern adults. Even on today's Children's Day, saying something about children is no exception.

Every adult who has tasted the sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness of life, whether satisfied with some kind of happy circumstance at present, or yearning for some kind of wonderful realm to come, feels that the children playing in front of them are little angels, the masters of the next generation. Or recalling the warm embrace and loving light of their own parents, they feel that their own childhood was their golden age. Such a "feeling," regardless of whether it is very accurate, has unconsciously maintained the intergenerational transmission of the past thousands of generations, and will continue to maintain the future generations of sons and grandsons because generations feel this way. However, the problem lies in the modern era. After all, do modern adults also give modern children a golden age? Under modern circumstances, although everyone expects children to be the masters of the next generation, there are too many, too strong, and too cruel trends that are trapping their own children as congenital little slaves and oppressing the children of other races as their own little slaves. Of course, there are children who have all the conditions to be little angels in all spiritual and material aspects, but they are only one in ten thousand in the world! On this Children's Day, who would not be happy to bless children, but this year and this festival are precisely when the vast majority of children are encountering extremely unfortunate times. Candies, toys, and the like can of course amuse the innocent smiles of children who do not know that they are encountering misfortune, decorate the festival, and are better than nothing, and the more the better, but how can they relieve misfortune.

The misfortune of children at this day and this time is the misfortune of the world, the misfortune of the vast majority of children; but we cannot imagine that there is anything worse than the misfortune of children in Shanghai and the occupied areas of China. Elsewhere in the world, the little lives sacrificed in bombings and stray bullets are most pitiful, and we give them the highest sympathy; children in Shanghai and the occupied areas are not being sacrificed in this way now, but it is more than that. Take Shanghai as an example: dozens or even hundreds of abandoned children's corpses are collected by charitable organizations every day; it is not possible to bury them after death and they have to be abandoned, which shows how these little lives struggle with the god of death every day while they are alive! Dozens or hundreds a day is certainly shocking, and there are those who have not been collected by charitable organizations, and those who struggle with the god of death every day but have not died, which are of course not included in these dozens or hundreds, which must be a huge number. Those who are already dead or about to die are indeed a huge number, and those who barely survive without dying must be even more numerous. They live on mother's milk, they live on leftovers, they live on occasional donations from others; they learn to be petty thieves, they learn to be robbers on the road, and the things they steal and rob are only a cake or a cookie, but fortunately the stolen, robbed, and police officers have pity and forgive them so that they can live; such children can be seen everywhere, but it is difficult to imagine seeing them outside of Shanghai. Far away from reality, leisurely singing about the little angels in front of us, the masters of the future, we only feel extremely heartbroken, and we can no longer muster any courage to join in this fun.

Some may think that this is the most tragic corner of society, although it is not representative of the general society, but at least it is the corner that the general society should most urgently give relief to. As for the children of the general society in Shanghai, if measured by the general so-called children's problems of modern times, it is also enough to take one's breath away. For example, let us put aside the so-called eugenics problems and eugenics policies, population problems and birth incentive policies, which are related to children's problems. The issues that are directly related to children, such as the active education issue, the nutrition issue, etc., are all extremely ordinary and important, but in today's Shanghai, talking about them is still too extravagant. There are those that are valued by various countries, and their theoretical research and practical investigations and measures have all reached a high level, and are especially necessary for Shanghai society, such as the issue of juvenile delinquency; in Shanghai, one only sees Shanghai as a huge and unparalleled open-air school that teaches children to commit crimes.

All children's problems are adults' problems; the particularly serious children's problems in Shanghai are problems that the general Shanghai people should be particularly responsible for; under the current situation, we certainly do not expect or talk extravagantly about all the problems of Shanghai's children; how to urgently seek answers should be done, but every adult has the most opportunities to contact children, and this is only to hope that every adult will do their best for what they come into contact with. If it is said that the Shanghai of the future will be the Shanghai of modern Shanghai children, then modern Shanghai people must at least know that sitting idly by and entrusting the future of Shanghai to a criminal open-air school is not a good plan! Children are innocent, the guilt lies with adults.

### Chongqing Newspapers Unanimously Congratulate the Eighth Plenary Session Declaration; Hope for the Earnest Implementation of Resolutions; General Chiang and His Wife Feted Central Committee Members

Chongqing: The declaration and various resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session have been unanimously congratulated by the newspapers of the wartime capital.

After the closing of the plenary session, the responsibility of the rear is heavier than that of the front, and the responsibility of party members is heavier than that of the people." The National Daily News said, "We earnestly hope that the compatriots of the whole country will use all their strength to assist the government and earnestly implement the various resolutions of the plenary session. We also hope that the government will resolutely implement them, even if there is thunderous opposition." The Shishi Xinbao also hopes that the various resolutions can be earnestly implemented.

### Summary of Resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee: Implement Economic Control to Ensure Victory in the War of Resistance and National Construction; Strengthen Unity Among Domestic Ethnic Groups and Religious Organizations

Chongqing: The following is a summary of the important resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee:

(1) On the proposal to mobilize financial resources, expand production, and implement controlled economy to ensure victory in the War of Resistance and National Construction. Resolved and passed, to be earnestly implemented by the government. Key points of the proposal:

Reason: The war has now lasted four years, and future warfare should be primarily economic warfare. The goals are, firstly, to strive for final victory, and secondly, to seek permanent national defense security. Therefore, all wartime measures should not only be implemented during the war but must be extended to the post-war period until the goal of absolute national defense security is achieved. All economic measures should follow this principle, making fundamental plans and construction, and promoting the coordination of various departments and the simultaneous development of various undertakings. The foundation of economic warfare lies in the supply of materials. To ensure an adequate supply of materials, expanding production is essential. Expanding production requires abundant financial resources and stable prices as preconditions. China's resources are inherently abundant, and the problem is not the lack of resources but the failure to actively develop them; not the lack of production but the failure to rationally use financial and human resources; not the lack of supply but the government's failure to统筹掌握 control and manage it. Therefore, on the one hand, government revenue is insufficient, and construction funds are stretched, while on the other hand, there is an abundance of idle capital in society. Even the previously desolate rural areas now show signs of active capital. On the one hand, there is a sense of labor shortage, while on the other hand, there is a waste of manpower. Those who seek shortcuts, speculate, manipulate the market, and do not engage in legitimate work are everywhere. This contradictory situation is due to the redistribution of social wealth during the war, which is the evil result of rising prices. If allowed to develop, it will make government finances increasingly strained, social idle capital more abundant, wages increasingly higher, and manpower waste more significant. Once a vicious economic cycle is formed, how can production be expanded? The scarcity of materials will surely cause poverty, and runaway prices will have no end. Without decisive measures, it is not enough to talk about economic warfare and ensure the final victory. Under these circumstances, the government authorities, learning from past mistakes, must make a decision, take responsibility, and set policies to concentrate all political forces, transform the economic situation, and enrich its content and essence. Based on the current urgent needs, several measures are proposed for discussion and resolution.

Measures: (A) Mobilizing Financial Resources: (1) Expand the direct tax system and strictly collect excessive profits tax. (2) Consumption taxes should uniformly adopt an ad valorem taxation system. (3) Implement a national monopoly system on a trial basis. (4) Strengthen the solicitation of public bonds and issue in-kind treasury bills for land tax. (B) Expanding Production: (1) Expand loans for industry and mining. (2) Stipulate phased production increase measures and limit the minimum production amount. (3) Expand the scope of military insurance and reduce insurance costs. (4) Increase working hours and improve work efficiency. (5) Mobilize national technical experts and enforce compulsory service. (6) Restrict workers from changing occupations and utilize female workers. (C) Stabilizing Prices: (1) Actively facilitate transportation. (2) Strictly prohibit provinces from levying excessive transit taxes. (3) Enforce warehouse management. (4) Strictly inspect finance. (5) Publicly discuss prices. (6) Conserve living expenses.

(2) On the Essentials of Governance to Strengthen the Permanent Harmonious Unity Among Domestic Ethnic Groups and Religions to Achieve the Goals of Victory in War and Success in National Construction (Proposed by the Presidium). Resolved and passed.

Original Proposal: Since our Founding Father created the Republic of China, the fundamental principle of national construction has been that all people in the country, regardless of race, religion, or class, are equal. This is recorded in the law and upheld by the whole country. The First National Congress of our Party reiterated that externally, we seek national independence and freedom; internally, we seek equality for all ethnic groups. Now, when the whole country is united and working together to resist the war, it is even more appropriate to strengthen the unity among domestic ethnic groups and the harmony among religions to implement the Three Principles of the People. Now, the essential measures for previous Congresses were summarized and the administrative guidelines regarding border areas were compiled as follows. (A) Regarding General Principles: (1) All measures for ethnic minorities in border areas should cultivate their ability to self-govern, improve their lives, and support their culture to ensure the foundation of their autonomy. (2) All measures for ethnic minorities in border areas should prioritize the interests of the local indigenous people. (3) Respect the religious beliefs and good social customs of all ethnic groups, and coordinate the emotions of all ethnic groups to establish a unified national culture. (B) Regarding Politics: (1) Local governments in border and near-border provinces should focus on revitalizing education and improving people's lives. The budget for this should be gradually increased. (2) Local governments in all border areas and border administration agencies at all levels should adapt to environmental conditions and, as much as possible, employ local people of all ethnic groups. Those who are excellent should be specially selected to participate in the central party and government to gather ideas and benefit widely. (C) Regarding Economy: (1) Quickly open up major highways and railways in border areas. (2) Gradually increase the number of financial institutions, professions, and cooperative organizations in various border areas to support the development of economic undertakings. (3) The government should provide as much capital and technical assistance as possible for the original production undertakings of the people in border areas. (D) Regarding Education: (1) Improve and expand existing border education institutions to cultivate talent in border areas. (2) Set up necessary vocational schools of all levels at appropriate locations, and set up normal schools of all levels to train various talents in border areas to meet the needs of construction. (3) Establish special translation agencies for border area languages to compile and print books and school textbooks in various ethnic languages.

He was drafted into the army during the First World War and served as an officer. In 1920, he served as the Cabinet Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, and soon retired.

### European War Anecdotes (43): Inside Germany During the War

Hitler owns the most exquisitely constructed air raid shelter in Berlin. According to experts, he would never be bombed to death there under any circumstances. This air raid shelter is very deep underground, constructed entirely of reinforced steel and concrete, and equipped with automatic ventilators and generators, a private movie screening room, and a surgical operating room for medical use. Even if British bombs leveled the Chancellery to the ground, and all the routes from the underground shelter to the outside were seemingly cut off, Hitler and his aides could still escape from the air raid shelter through an underground passage, run several hundred yards away, and safely ascend to the surface from underground. Hitler's air raid shelter is equipped with spacious bedrooms, which is a crucial design (it's a pity they didn't pay attention to this in other air raid shelters), because the losses suffered by Germans from insomnia are greater than those from the bombing by the British air force.

During a period last autumn, several minor European politicians gathered in Berlin, some to receive final instructions, others to "pick up some scraps," hoping to get some benefits from Hitler's leftovers. Some of them, when returning to their respective capitals, were convinced that Berlin would never be bombed (Goering boasted of this), which was actually deceptive. Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer, General Franco's brother-in-law, a humble and approachable man, was on a grand tour of Berlin at this time, and when he returned to his country, he almost took such a report with him. In the end, he didn't do so, which was due to the correspondents of American newspapers.

The reason was that American journalists sitting in the Adlon Hotel saw that Mr. Suñer was about to return to Madrid and would inevitably tell Franco that in his ten long nights in Berlin, not a single British aircraft had ever been detected over the capital, the British were simply finished, and now was the best opportunity for Spain to join the Axis camp. Some journalists had already hinted at this meaning in their telegrams as much as they could. Finally, on the night before Suñer left Berlin, the British Air Force visited Berlin. Goebbels and several high-ranking Nazi Party officials were hosting a banquet for the Spanish dignitary at the Adlon Hotel that evening. Before the dessert was served, the grand feast ended hastily, and all the guests and attendants rushed to the spacious underground shelter of the Adlon Hotel next to the barber shop, hiding there until they "emerged" from the ground at about four o'clock in the morning.

Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also spent a night in the underground shelter next to the barber shop. Afterwards, British aircraft paid special attention to the diplomatic comings and goings in Berlin, although they didn't necessarily choose an auspicious day. On the night Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov arrived in Berlin, many people thought that British aircraft would definitely not let go of this opportunity. That night, Ribbentrop treated him as a state guest, with a grand banquet. Almost all the leaders of the Nazi Party, except Hitler, and senior officers of the army, navy, and air force were present. I still remember the unease of some officials in the Chancellery that evening. They were deeply afraid that such a solemn banquet, if it had to be moved to the underground shelter under the threat of bombs, wouldn't it become a great laughing stock? That night, British aircraft did not appear. The next night, when German officials attended a banquet at the Soviet Embassy, they came in force without any courtesy. Goering had previously ordered his subordinates that as soon as they received a report of British aircraft flying into German territory, they must immediately notify the Berlin authorities so that all the guests could slip away half an hour early before the air raid alarm was issued in the city. According to those present, Molotov was unwilling to step into the underground shelter when the air raid occurred, but looked up at the fireworks and shooting stars in the sky from a dark window. That night, British aircraft carefully did not drop bombs in the city center, so no major mishaps occurred.

The damage Berlin suffered from British air raids was relatively small. Tourists who came to Berlin for the first time could wander in the commercial and residential areas for several hours without seeing a bombed-out house. The number of bombed houses was probably less than five hundred, and most of the attacked houses were repaired within a month, and the residents moved back in. The places bombed by British aircraft were mostly factories in the suburbs. The Siemens electrical factory in the northwest suburb of Berlin, and the areas where the Heinkel and Henschel aircraft factories were located, were the most important bombing targets in the Berlin area, and the British Air Force had repeatedly determined to bomb them to their satisfaction. On several nights, they were indeed bombed, with a machine workshop here and a storage area there damaged. But what is questionable is that on the day of the bombing, the reduction in the quantity of military equipment produced in these factories was probably less than five percent of the total. Recently, I drove through the area and heard the large machines in the factories running as usual, and from the outside, there was no sign of damage. Since the British concentrated their bombing on the Krupp artillery factory in Essen since mid-November last winter, I have not been there myself. But an American journalist I deeply trust had gone to observe afterwards, and he expressed surprise at the small amount of air raid damage there.

This matter is truly puzzling to observers in Germany, because a large smelting furnace of the Krupp artillery factory is built in the open air. In theory, it should be easily spotted by airmen at night.

To the best of my knowledge, British aircraft have never carried out a terrible bombing of residential or commercial areas in Berlin. It is true that British aircraft have affected nearby cemeteries and even hospitals because they could not hit the railroads or stations. Although the large harbor and shipyards of Hamburg were bombed, it was not very severe. When I visited the area last autumn, I deeply felt that the heart of this second German city was virtually undamaged. The city center that was most severely bombed was probably Munich. Most of the destruction was caused in one night on the evening of November 8. Hitler was giving a speech in the Löwenbräukeller beer cellar in commemoration of the 1923 putsch that night, and as soon as he finished speaking, a major bombing occurred. However, on this occasion, the British Air Force did not look for the beer hall, but only dropped bombs on the central train station and the electrical vehicle control yard, etc. Several houses in the vicinity also suffered as collateral damage.

### Matsuoka Pays Homage to the Pope, Discusses World Politics, Finishes Talks with Italian Authorities, Returns to Berlin to Continue Discussions with Germany

Vatican City – Reliable sources claim that Pope Pius XII and Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka yesterday discussed the relationship between the Soviet Union, Japan, and China, issues of Vatican missionary work, and peace procedures before the Axis spring offensive. It is understood that Matsuoka expressed regret over the Holy See's policy of supporting General Chiang Kai-shek, stating that Japan's policy mainly opposes the Communist Party and therefore does not oppose the Vatican's principles of attacking atheism. Reliable sources believe that Matsuoka suggested the Holy See withdraw its aid to China, as such aid benefits the Soviet Union's position in China, and communism inherently includes atheists. He further emphasized that Japan's interest is not religion, and therefore Japan will always allow Catholicism to preach in the occupied areas of China. The Pope received Matsuoka in his private chamber for approximately sixty-five minutes of talks in Italian. Vatican authoritative circles said that after Pope Pius XII met with Matsuoka, he remarked, "I am extremely pleased; Mr. Matsuoka is a great politician." It is rumored that during the secret talks, the Pope expressed his pleasure at Matsuoka's recent statement that Japan has always believed in peace. The Pope then presented the key points of peace and hoped that peace would be possible before the spring offensive. It is rumored that Matsuoka reiterated Japan's intention for peace and emphasized the importance of Japan's military obligations in the Tripartite Pact. The Japanese Foreign Minister expressed his willingness to cooperate in any efforts to prevent the European war from extending to the United States and Yugoslavia. After paying homage to the Pope, Matsuoka met with Prime Minister Mussolini and had lunch together. The Japanese Ambassador to Rome, Horiguchi, the German Ambassador to Italy, and representatives from the Italian government, military, and Fascist Party also attended the banquet. Horiguchi also hosted a dinner that evening to welcome Matsuoka, it is said. (United Press, 3rd)

Rome – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka gave a speech to German, Italian, and Japanese journalists at Villa Madama yesterday, guaranteeing that the people of the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan will always cooperate loyally. He stated that Italy and Japan should fight side by side to the end until their goals are achieved. The alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan is an alliance of a special nature, emphasizing the common interests of the three countries, while the individual interests of each country are secondary. The three countries share weal and woe, so this alliance will inevitably last for thousands of years. Matsuoka continued, saying that his conversations with Italy were sincere and inspiring. He was deeply impressed by his talks with the Italian Prime Minister. He also exchanged views with Foreign Minister Ciano. Matsuoka added that his visit to the Pope in Rome would be one of the most memorable events of his life. He was pleased to have spoken with the Pope and the Secretary of State of the Vatican and felt the trip was worthwhile. Matsuoka ended by saying that he would like to travel in Germany and Italy and would stay in Berlin for a few more days, but only on a non-official basis. He deeply hoped to visit the Western battlefield but had to pack his bags and return home early due to his duties. He might stay in Moscow for one day en route to make contact with key officials of the Soviet Union, but it would also be on a personal basis, it is said. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)

London – Diplomatic circles here said yesterday that Matsuoka had been summoned to return to Tokyo and was avoiding further restrictions from the Axis powers. It is rumored that Matsuoka had full authority to unite Japan with the Axis militarily, but because of the coup in Yugoslavia, the British's great victory in East Africa in the Mediterranean, and the United States' sudden hardening of its attitude by seizing Axis ships, the Japanese government changed its mind at the last minute. It is rumored that Matsuoka will return to Tokyo before the end of this month, and his long-planned trip to the capitals of European Axis countries has been cancelled. (International News Agency, 3rd)

Berlin – German foreign affairs officials said yesterday that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka may return to Berlin from Rome to continue discussions with authorities, it is said. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)

Rome – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka, after a sixty-three-hour visit to Rome, took a train at 10:00 this morning to Berlin for his return journey to Japan. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and the Yugoslav Ambassador, Chiritich, saw him off at St. Paul's Station. When Matsuoka departed, thousands of Romans lined the streets in the heavy rain to see him off. From Villa Madama to the station, the streets were crowded with people. They waved the flags of Germany, Italy, and Japan and cheered as Matsuoka and Ciano passed by in the same car. According to Matsuoka's statement in the press yesterday, he will stay in Berlin for one day after returning before heading to Moscow. He will also stay in Moscow for several days. Before his departure, Matsuoka told the press that he regretted that the time was too short to visit the current war battlefields. (United Press, 3rd)

### American Newspapers Comment on Ogura's Cabinet Appointment

Washington – Prime Minister Konoe's invitation to Masatsune Ogura, a major entrepreneur and director of the Sumitomo Company, to join the cabinet has aroused considerable interest here. Those familiar with Far Eastern affairs are now making various speculations, believing that this appointment may indicate the serious situation of the Japanese economy due to prolonged warfare with little success. Some also say that the Japanese military, which dominates policy, now realizes that the handling of war and the national economy cannot be solely undertaken by the military, so Ogura's policies after taking office will be closely watched. The Washington Star commented on the matter, calling Konoe an alert opportunist, and that his recruitment of Ogura into the cabinet shows that he has not yet subjected Japan to final restrictions in all aspects. The coup in Yugoslavia, the defeat of the Italian army, and the strong attitude of the United States, which has seized Axis ships, have certainly increased Konoe's caution, it is said. (Reuters, 3rd)

Tokyo – Masatsune Ogura, director of the Sumitomo Company, was sworn in yesterday as a minister without portfolio. It is generally expected that Ogura's business experience will help the government establish closer ties with the economic and industrial sectors, it is said. (Reuters, 3rd)

When the United States replies to the German and Italian protest notes, the State Department may propose to the German and Italian embassies the issue of publishing the correspondence, it is said. It is rumored that Germany has now sent a second protest note to the United States regarding the seizure of ships. (Reuters, 3rd)

Washington – Yesterday, the U.S. State Department announced that it had received two protest notes from Germany and Italy regarding the U.S. seizure of their ships and the detention of sailors.

(Haitong News Agency, 3rd)

Mexico City – According to information obtained last night, before Mexico confiscated German and Italian ships, Mexican Foreign Minister Padilla received a note from U.S. Ambassador Daniels stating that the U.S. would soon confiscate Axis ships and hoped Mexico would take the same action.

Danish Capital – The Danish Foreign Ministry issued an official statement last night regarding the confiscation of Danish ships by South American countries. The original text is as follows: "After the Chilean government confiscated three ships of the Danish Lauritzen shipping company, the Danish Minister to Argentina and Chile, Sang, flew to the Chilean capital to protest to the Chilean Foreign Ministry and demand that the detained ships be returned to the Danish shipping company, it is said.

### American Labor Unrest Surges, Large-Scale Bloody Incident Occurs, Thirty Injured at Ford Factory, Four Miners Killed in Harlan

Dearborn, Michigan – The world's largest industrial organization has become the focus of American labor disputes. Workers inside provoked the supervisors, leading to a fight. The Governor of Michigan has ordered all police to the factory to suppress the unrest, and Police Chief Block has dispatched an additional 250 officers to assist the 130 police officers already sent. Federal mediator Dewey flew here yesterday, attempting to get the union and the factory to reach a peace agreement. Strike leader Wichman telegraphed Nathan, the production management supervisor, and Hillman, the labor representative of the National Defense Committee, requesting that they send personnel to escort workers through the strike supervisors to enter the factory in order to maintain national defense work. According to the union, there are as many as 95,000 strikers. All factory gates are blocked by cars, with as many as fifteen cars arranged in a line to block each gate. The union said that the strike was caused by demands for increased wages, recognition of the union, and reinstatement of dismissed workers. It is rumored that a man named Caruso is in critical condition due to his injuries. Bernard, the factory's personnel director, said that Ford has stated twice that the eight Industrial Organizations Committee members whose dismissal sparked the strike will never be allowed to work at the Ford Motor Company again. Bernard also said that the company has proven that the leaders of the Industrial Organizations Committee are communists, and these party members hope to bring national industrial life to a complete standstill in order to create a revolutionary situation and realize the dictatorship of the proletariat. But Bernard added that all the members of the Industrial Organizations Congress are patriotic, it is said. (United Press, 3rd)

### Food: Foreign Rice Pours In, Market Prices Slightly Weaker

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taigu Company's Taiyuan Wheel arrived yesterday morning from Hong Kong with 7,201 bags of foreign rice and 1,000 bags of corn, berthing at the company's wharf in the French Concession for unloading. Also, the Zhejiang Wheel also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 2,766 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthing at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. Yongzhen Wheel, managed by Xia Laochen Foreign Firm, was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday from Yangon, Myanmar, but had not yet entered the port as of late at night. According to the company, due to special circumstances, the ship is traveling slower and should arrive one or two days later. The exact date cannot be specified because the ship has not reported it. (祖)

The inventory of foreign rice is gradually increasing, and the supply is endless. It is difficult for general speculators to rely on Japanese yen loans and false fixed orders and ships to raise prices, and the excess of supply over demand is enough to prove that the market price is not easy to rise. Therefore, new customers are watching and not advancing, and profit-taking bulls are eager to close out. The opening market has a strong selling atmosphere, and the market is unable to support it and is falling. The small Jiao Yinghua Si original package opened at 129 yuan, but yesterday it had already fallen to 115 or 6 yuan, and the road goods were only 124 yuan, both 3 to 4 yuan lower than the previous market. The afternoon business was even more sluggish, and the market price was called down by nearly one yuan, but there were no buyers. Although spot transactions were active, under the competition of many sellers, the high-end prices were gradually declining. No. 1 Siam opened at 110 yuan, settling at 108.8 yuan to 108 yuan. Also, No. 2 was from 107 yuan to 105.5 yuan, 火絞 (Huojiao) at 107 yuan, and 小絞 (Xiaojiao) at 104.5 yuan. These were all 2 to 3 yuan lower than the previous market. The afternoon was weak and lacking in transactions, and the after-market may have to weaken again. The total transaction volume for the day was 10,000 bags of spot rice and 400 to 500 tons of original packages. Observing the above prices, the difference in quality is negligible, that is, taking No. 1 Siam and 小絞 (Xiaojiao) as examples, the distance is only about 2 yuan, which is truly unimaginable.

Due to the recent repeated downstream prices of thick and thin粳 (Jing) and other domestic rice, transporters have suffered losses and have mostly stopped. The owners, in order to protect themselves, are unwilling to lightly sell, and hold on with all their might. Therefore, although local stores are not selling well, the market has not changed and is in a stable situation. The prices quoted are all similar to before, with little rise or fall.

糯 (Nuo) rice is constrained by foreign rice and finds it difficult to stand firm, depreciating by one or two yuan. Hong Kong special yuan opened at 140 yuan, settling at 100 yuan. 糯茶 (Nuocha) high opened at 96 or 7 yuan, settling to broken rice at 90 yuan.

### The Flour Market Has Very Little Fluctuation

Flour: The current spot market for foreign flour is dull due to the flat sales of customer gangs for several days. Since the local street has a daily supply of flat-priced flour, the demand is even more sluggish. Moreover, the miscellaneous grains market has been calm recently, and speculative groups are all in a wait-and-see state. Therefore, flour prices fluctuate very little. Hua Wu and Zhonglou brand Australian flour opened at 29.12 yuan to 29 yuan. Jinlong brand Kan flour ended up with both inventories and deliveries, rising and falling quickly, priced at 28.8 yuan back to 28.65 yuan, with less than 10,000 bags traded. The market is still brewing.

Wheat: The market was as sluggish as usual yesterday. There is currently a long-term lack of spot goods, generally said to be a market with no goods. Except for the occasional sporadic arrivals from nearby from Japanese factories, and retail purchases, there are no whole transactions. The selling price is still 45 or 6 yuan, also in the brewing stage.

Beans: Arrived in Shanghai, with 1,350 bags shipped from Qingdao yesterday.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Short Selling Increases Sharply

Foreign exchange: The market condition yesterday, HSBC's listing remained flat. In the dark market for British and American exchanges, the potential was slightly relaxed. At around 10 o'clock, the market suddenly rumored that the Emperor of Japan had recalled Matsuoka, and the speculators' intention to sell suddenly emerged, squeezing out about 7 to 800,000 US dollars of May-term US exchange, resulting in a settlement of 5.3125 yuan for the May-term US exchange at one point. However, HSBC's profits and other external firms were healthy, and Chinese firms were also absorbing, so as a result, although the spot and this month were slightly loose, the May-term futures were flat. The closing price for spot and this month was 3 and 25 cents and 5.3125 yuan, and the May-term was 3 and 234375 cents and 5.28125 yuan.

Speculation Pushes Out Term US Exchange

In the early morning, due to the flat London big strips, and the stable dollar price and London raw surplus, various exchanges such as British and American exchanges were unchanged. The central listing of various exchanges was as before. The banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, British gold 3 and 234375 cents, US exchange 5.28125 yuan, both flat compared to the previous close. After opening, foreign firms did a little bit of business, and the market was dull and flat. It is estimated that Maijiali sold 4-month US exchange at 5.28125 yuan to HSBC. HSBC's listing was unchanged. The silver balance tax was also flat. After that, Japanese banks吐出 (tutoo, unsure of the exact meaning here), and profits were also sold, but foreign banks, including HSBC, still had absorption, and Chinese banks frequently came to absorb, so the term market situation was still stable. It is estimated that HSBC absorbed spot US exchange from Japanese banks and British banks' profits at 5.3125 yuan, amounting to more than 200,000 dollars. Later, a sudden negative rumor arose, and speculators forcefully squeezed 4- and 5-month term US exchange for 500,000 yuan. At that time, HSBC's absorption turned dull, and the market situation relaxed accordingly. It is estimated that 4-month US exchange was sold to Chinese banks at 5.3125 yuan, and 4-month US exchange was sold to foreign banks at 5.34375 yuan, and 5-month US exchange was sold at 5.3125 yuan. As a result, the closing price for British gold was 3 and 25 cents, and US exchange was 5.3125 yuan.

The Market Situation Relaxed Accordingly

In the aftermarket, speculators continued to short sell, and foreign merchants grabbed customers and also squeezed. However, HSBC and other's absorption recovered well, and the term futures market actually tightened. It is estimated that 5-month US exchange was opened at 5.3125 yuan. At that time, to close the 進 (jin) position, it already required 5.28125 yuan. Later, trading gradually decreased, and the situation was flat. As a result, the closing price was British gold 3 and 25 cents, US exchange 5.3125 yuan, 5-month British gold 3 and 234375 cents, and 5-month US exchange 5.28125 yuan, compared to the previous day's spot and April, British long 015625, US hard 03125, and 5-month were not distinguished in glory or disgrace.

Hong Kong Shen Exchange Drops Uniquely

Hong Kong, 3rd (Thursday) Electric: The exchange market opened flat this morning, and various exchanges were unchanged. At 11:30, it was reported as flat, and the spot Shen exchange dropped uniquely by one yuan, to 463 yuan. The rest were unchanged.

Tianjin British and American Shrink Together

Tianjin, 3rd (Thursday) Electric: The exchange market opened flat this morning, London Telegraphic Transfer, 03125, to 3 便士 (pennies) 34375 (the telegraphic code may be incorrect, pending verification), New York Telegraphic Transfer also shrank 03125, to 5 and a half yuan, Shen exchange rose by 9 cents, to 95.75 yuan, and the "Joint Notes" dark plate rose by 25 cents, to 63.75 yuan.

### Gold Market Sentiment Unsettled, Price Reverses from Rise to Fall

Yesterday, the Shanghai gold market, after a period of subdued trading, saw a slight change. Initially, the price rose, but then suddenly and sharply fell, once dropping to the vicinity of 6,500 yuan. Eventually, it recovered slightly. The upward sentiment that prevailed among various parties was dashed by rumors seen as detrimental. It was widely rumored that the Japanese Emperor had recalled Matsuoka, the foreign minister active in Germany and Italy, triggering nervous rumors that Japan was withdrawing from the Axis powers and hastily returning home to embrace the Anglo-American camp. As a result, the U.S. dollar exchange rate relaxed, and the central gold price eased. The price, initially supported by securities firms, reached 6,586 yuan before gradually falling to 6,505 yuan, after gold shops resumed selling. Eventually, as the rumors were deemed too far-fetched, news of a slight softening in the U.S. dollar exchange rate and buying activity in Shanghai's western districts led the price to recover to around 6,540 yuan. The closing price was down 31 yuan. The total daily trading volume was approximately 15,000 to 16,000 taels. Cash transactions were increasingly prevalent. First, Shihe sold 100 taels to Xianghe, with the price 150 yuan higher than the futures price. Wanfeng sold 50 taels to Xianghe, 155 yuan higher. Later, Yongcheng sold 70 taels to Decheng, Chengji sold 50 taels to Xianghe, and Wanfeng sold 100 taels to Xiangxingyong, while Litai sold a total of 270 taels to Xiangxingyong and Xianghe, all at 160 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Defu purchased 100 taels from Yifeng, 170 yuan higher. Finally, there were buyers at 180 yuan higher. This was for settling previous positions. Jewelry gold initially fell and then recovered to flat, remaining at 690 yuan. Customs gold and other gold prices were flat. The swap date for this month (April turning into May), the 10th, coincides with the Tomb Sweeping Festival holiday (four days of holiday including Sunday, from the 11th to the 14th), so it will be held in advance from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM on the 10th.

 Shanghai Gold Plunge Nears Noon

In the early morning, the opening price for each bar (ten taels) was 6,565 yuan, one yuan higher than the previous day's high. Subsequently, buying interest intensified, with Defu, Yifeng, Tongkangyong, Dafeng, and others actively bidding up the price. It soon reached 6,586 yuan. However, Xin Fengyong, a foreign exchange firm, frequently sold, and Chengji, Hengji, and Decheng also sold, causing the price to fall slightly to 6,570 yuan. At that time, Decheng reversed to buy, and Xiangxingyong also came in to buy. The market situation was once stable. Around 10:30 AM, selling pressure suddenly emerged, with Renchengyong, Hesheng, and Xianghe selling heavily. Coupled with a strengthening of the foreign exchange market and rumors of negative news, the price fell to 6,532 yuan. Later, Xianghe and Daji reversed to buy, pulling the price up by 15 yuan. However, with sentiment weak and selling pressure re-emerging, Tongkangyong, Defu, and Chengji sold heavily, pushing the price down again to 6,505 yuan. At noon, Gonghe and Hengji still had buying interest, but by the close, the price had recovered to 6,522 yuan. The afternoon opening was down 12 yuan, at 6,510 yuan. However, after the opening, major players came in to buy. Although Chengji and Hengji sold, the market gradually rose, soon recovering 28 yuan, reaching the 6,530 yuan level. At this time, the foreign exchange futures market softened slightly, so Dafeng and Deda bought to cover short positions, continuing the recovery to 6,542 yuan. In the evening, Hengji continued to sell, and the number of buyers decreased. The closing price was 6,532 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 21 yuan compared to the previous day. Based on the closing price of the U.S. dollar at 5.3125 yuan in April, the closing price was 6,555.3 yuan, a decrease of 23.3 yuan. After the market closed, the price rose to 6,538 yuan. The daily fluctuation was 81 yuan. The selling price of cash gold from major gold shops was 200 yuan higher than the Shanghai gold futures price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot gold.

 Jewelry Gold Initially Falls Slightly, Then Rises Significantly

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at Datongxing and Xintongxing was lowered by 10 yuan at 11:00 AM, to 680 yuan. At 3:00 PM, it increased by 10 yuan, leveling at 690 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 10 yuan.

### Foreign Currency Decline Not Significant

Yesterday, in the foreign currency market, after rising, the Shanghai gold market price turned downward, and British and American gold pounds each fell by one yuan. British gold bills remained stable, and the market price was flat. U.S. dollar bills initially rose to 18.70 yuan, then gradually declined to 18.051 yuan. In the afternoon, they rose again to 18.54 yuan, still down 0.12 yuan from the previous day. Hong Kong dollar bills rose and then returned to flat. Japanese gold bills showed a slight upward trend, rising to 1.98 yuan in the evening session. Korean dollar bills had balanced supply and demand, and the market price was flat, remaining at 1.64 yuan in the evening session.

### Securities: Domestic Bond Market Strengthens

The over-the-counter market for public bonds strengthened yesterday, and the positions of buyers and sellers also changed. Tongkang's buying interest was strong, and Xinfu's buying interest was also not weak, changing the market trend. The short positions of general retail investors and those who follow the trend gradually wavered. As for the rumor that Japan was withdrawing from the Axis powers, it was still far from being confirmed and had no immediate impact on the market price. The positive outlook for the market price was solely due to the fact that buyers were only buying and not selling. Yesterday's trading saw Tongkang, Jiafu, Defu, and Jiucheng buying in the morning, while Yu Xingzhong sold significant amounts of categories A, B, and C, reducing the market price slightly. Midway through the session, Tongkang's buying interest was very strong, and the buying side gradually gained the upper hand, raising the price by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The closing price at noon was higher than the previous day. In the afternoon, Tongkang and Xinfu continued their strong buying interest, and a certain financial figure representing Shengda also bought very strongly. Qianyi also showed interest in buying. Yuxing sold another 200,000 to 300,000 yuan of category E. Renfeng and Yitai Zhongyi both sold. As a result, the price continued to rise by 0.051 yuan to 0.25 yuan. The total transaction volume was 1.5-1.6 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Stock Transactions: 100 shares of China National Underwear Company were traded at a price of 10.025 yuan.

Also, the 50 shares of Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory that were traded the day before at a price of 22.25 yuan were mistakenly reported as 20.025 yuan. This is now corrected.

London, 2nd (Wednesday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British companies' stocks remained flat. Only bank stocks showed some improvement, continuing to rise. Mercantile Bank shares continued to rise by 1 shilling and 3 pence, to £8 16s 3d. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares each rose by £1, with shares registered in London at £76 and shares registered in Hong Kong at £77. There were prices but no market. There were no other changes.

### Cotton Yarn and Cotton Flower Market Are Only Used for Speculation; Actual Sales Are Seized, All Replaced by Miscellaneous Brands

The yarn market remains weak, and the trend is still hovering. This is because sales have not fully developed. Although Hong Kong merchants are interested in buying, they still specify a few brands: 23 strands of Golden Rooster, Dafat 20 strands, Special Jincheng, Shepherd, and the remaining 32 strands of single yarn. They purchase only a few bales each day, and do not ask about anything else. Therefore, the single yarns of the Shuangma factory are all traded like a football being kicked around. When the chips on the market are loose, the price will fall; when they are tight, the price will rise. The public is holding a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for a change to come before deciding the outcome. The overall situation is still depressing. The high price for 20 strands of Shuangma was 1,401 yuan, and the low price was 1,386 yuan. The opening price in the early afternoon was 1,390.5 yuan, rising to 1,394.5 yuan. The final price was 1,393 yuan. The over-the-counter situation in the afternoon was that there were many shouting prices, but few transactions.

Shuangma: The opening was slightly stable, with the opening price at 1,393 yuan. After that, buying was strong, and the situation became more active. Some people said that if buyers of the Shenxin Factory failed to clear their purchases after April 15th, they would have to pay an additional 15 yuan in warehouse rent per piece. After many parties requested the factory to reduce the warehouse rent or proceed with negotiations, the sentiment of the buying parties was boosted, and the market once rose to 1,401 yuan. However, the bid price was mediocre, and the foreign exchange market was quiet and saw a slight decrease, returning to 1,393.5 yuan. By the close, rumors suddenly arose in the market that the bid price had plummeted, and selling pressure increased, falling to 1,386 yuan. The closing price recovered to 1,389 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics totaled 5,515 bales. The amount purchased by each merchant group is listed below:

Hong Kong: 460; Fuzhou: 15; Nanyang: 30

Colleagues: 5,000; Total: 5,515

### Factory Demand Increases Daily; Cotton Market Active

The current cotton situation is slightly weaker, but the price of 42 strands of raw materials is still high due to the strength of American cotton. Factories are also interested in buying, but not as aggressively as cotton firms. As for foreign factories, most ship directly, leaving no room for cotton merchants to intervene, so they cannot be very enthusiastic. However, industry colleagues uniformly hope for higher prices. As a result, the long-stagnant cotton market has shown a glimmer of hope. Today, affected by the weakness of the yarn market, the market price fell slightly by 1-2 yuan, but sentiment and transactions were very active. The total number of transactions between factories and cotton firms throughout the day was 4,686 pieces. The transactions for each type of cotton are recorded below:

Dazhongjimujia: 290.0; Xinyu: 200 pieces

Dazhongjijiebao: 287.0; Xinyu: 300 pieces

Meipengjiapo: 305.0; Shanghai: 500 pieces

Meijiapo: 300.0; Donghua: 300 pieces

Meizhongjiebao: 280.0; Shenxin: 221 pieces

Mitelin: 371.0; Shenxin: 80 pieces

Mitelin: 22.0; Shenxin: 200 pieces

Xinte: 188.25; Shenxin: 225 pieces

Bailuoqu: 245.0; Haojia: 200 pieces

Dazhongjijiebao: 287.0; Colleagues: 300 pieces

Dazhongjimujia: 295.0; Colleagues: 105 pieces

Brazil: 381.5; Wanchang: 114 pieces

Xirongcaobao: 263.0; Kaitai: 150 pieces

NT: 310.0; Colleagues: 200 pieces

According to another report, foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai were more active than the previous day, and yarn factories also showed some improvement in inventory. There have been many transactions in recent days, and the buying sentiment among colleagues is still strong. The market situation is also trending towards being firmer, with an increase of 2-3 yuan.

The New York cotton market was quiet and firm in the early morning, but suddenly rallied later due to large-scale buying and news from Washington that American cotton would receive 75% loan support. As a result, the closing price rose by 6-10 points.

Indian cotton was quite flat, initially falling due to the sale of cotton contracts and profit-taking by long positions, but then recovering due to buyer support. Yesterday's closing price for Bailuoqu fell by 5 rupees, while the rest fell by 2-4 rupees. It is predicted that the opening price today will rise slightly by 1.5 rupees.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Factory Plates Are Very Tight

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend was firm and rising, and transactions were frequent. This was because the plates of each cloth factory were very tight. The current market for fine cloth twill from local factories is still cheaper than Dong Pi. Demand from dyeing factories is gradually increasing. Distant customers such as Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants continue to purchase dark-colored cotton cloth. The selling price of fine cloth twill has increased by 0.25 yuan. Light-weight coarse cloth and colored cloth have increased by 0.25-0.5 yuan. Over 600 pieces of gray cloth and bleached cloth were traded in Muji Street. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchased over 300 pieces of blue cloth, serge, and flannel. Purchases by Zhejiang and Fujian merchants were relatively sparse. Over 4,000 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth were purchased by foreign countries such as Singapore and Siam.

Heavy Leather Takes Off, Sales Have Started

The heavy leather market yesterday was quite firm and rising. Whether it was plain, striped, checkered, or dotted, the trend was unusually brisk. This was because inventory was lacking, and heavy leather is completely woven from raw hair and is considered valuable only if it has elasticity. Therefore, no goods from local factories have been woven and released, making the market goods even scarcer. In terms of sales, it is essential for the summer season, so clothing stores for major customers must have it in stock. In recent days, actual sales have been increasing in the market, and customers have been inquiring and placing orders one after another. Tailors of Western clothing have all been buying. Yesterday, 14,000 pieces of plain and striped heavy leather from Futai were sold at a wholesale price of 26.5 yuan per yard. It is said that a total of over 500 yards were sold.

### Sugar Market: Large Quantities of Coarse White Sugar Released

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight decline because Taikoo released a large quantity of coarse white sugar, causing sentiment to soften. Taikoo released thousands of bags of June shipment of Dutch coarse white sugar, with the price at USD 3.60, according to the C.I.F. standard. It also released 8,000 bags of B-mark military white sugar at HKD 14.20, 8,000 bags of DY-mark at HKD 13.90, and 4,000 bags of HX-mark at HKD 13.80. The guild's quoted prices for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar were 89.5 yuan for the local warehouse, 89 yuan for the foreign warehouse, 88.5 yuan, 88 yuan, and 88.3 yuan. The futures price for the 10th of the current month was 89.5 yuan, 89 yuan, 88.8 yuan, 88.5 yuan, 88.3 yuan, and 88.7 yuan, all slightly lower than Yuan Xu. The futures price for the 20th of the current month was 90.07 yuan, 90 yuan, 89.5 yuan, 85 yuan, 89.5 yuan, 89.7 yuan, slightly lower than 0.9 yuan. The Dutch red sugar initially tightened and then softened, reaching 69.5 yuan, then falling to 69 yuan and 68.8 yuan, without any changes. The price of Taikoo's coarse white sugar B-mark in the West warehouse was 89.5 yuan, slightly lower than 1 yuan. The price of DY-mark was 84.4 yuan, and the price of HX-mark was 83.4 yuan. The price of this No. 1 ice sugar was 114 yuan, and the price of Jingming ice sugar was 115 yuan. Also, 6,425 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Sugar Stocks Increase Continuously

The amount of sugar in this city continues to increase due to successive arrivals. Among them, only the amount of Dutch red raw sugar bowls is reduced compared to before, and the rest have increased. The detailed amounts of each type of sugar are listed below:

Type of Sugar: Stock Amount

Coarse White: 137,405

Dutch Red: 16,784

Raw Sugar: 6,717

Sugar Bowls: 1,125

Taikoo Coarse White B: 15,120

CX: 180

DY: 5,130

HX: 13,809

HM: 1,625

Taikoo Coarse Red H: 7,187

Local Sugar: 2,500

### Changes to the Number of Members on the Municipal Council Require Approval from the Chinese Government; Consuls of the Three Countries Are Still Consulting on a Solution; Chinese People Express Regret Over the New Distribution

Reliable sources reported yesterday morning (the 3rd) that the Consuls General of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan stationed in Shanghai are currently consulting and preparing to draft a resolution to change the number of members on the Municipal Council. This proposal will be presented at a special meeting of taxpayers on April 17th. Sources familiar with the matter stated that the details of the resolution will not be disclosed until the resolution is passed by the taxpayers' meeting. It is heard that if this proposal is approved by the taxpayers, it will be submitted to the countries that have treaties with China and the Chinese government for approval. It was not possible to confirm yesterday morning what steps the Consuls General of the three countries would take to obtain the approval of the Chinese government for the change in the number of members on the Municipal Council, as all treaty countries except Japan recognize the Chongqing government as the legitimate government of China.

### Clearly Conflicts with the Land Regulations

The China Mail reported that the Chinese taxpayers in the Public Concession, although fully aware of the difficulties they and the Municipal Council are currently encountering, opposed the new ratio of the distribution of the number of members on the Municipal Council among the expatriates of various countries. It is claimed that the new method announced by Mr. Philip Felling, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, is in conflict with the provisions of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations. It is anticipated that the Chinese government will protest against this, as the actions of the Municipal Council must be based on the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, which were originally approved by the Chinese government.

Legitimate Chinese Directors Should Be Maintained

Due to the changes in the situation, they and the Municipal Council have many difficulties that must be overcome, but it is hoped that the Municipal Council will do its best to maintain the status of the legitimate Chinese directors who have been re-elected. As for the three Chinese directors who remain in Shanghai, it is not yet known how they will act in response to the current changing situation. It is found that two of the five Chinese directors on the Municipal Council have left Shanghai, and the new ratio of the Municipal Council allows Chinese directors to occupy four seats. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association will push for the election of another new Chinese director. Responsible parties refuse to disclose information. It is heard that important documents and files of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession on Hong Kong Road have been removed. Chinese taxpayers are now afraid that someone may use the reason that the current Chinese directors were illegally re-elected to try to appoint other Chinese directors. However, the orthodox Chinese Taxpayers' Association insists that the Chinese directors were all re-elected in accordance with the law.

May Encounter Considerable Difficulties

However, since Japanese expatriates have a significant stake in the change in the number of members on the Municipal Council, and the Land Regulations stipulate that such matters must be discussed with the Chinese government and approved by them, it is expected that the change in the number of members on the Municipal Council may encounter difficulties. It is heard that the Consuls General of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan will discuss this matter during the current consultations and obtain a satisfactory solution.

Portuguese Community Believes They Should Have a Seat

The Consul General of Portugal in Shanghai, Mr. Melo, told reporters yesterday morning that if there are any changes to the number of members on the Municipal Council, he will do his best to obtain a seat on the board for Portuguese candidates. He shares the same attitude towards the election of the Municipal Council as most other Consuls General, hoping that a solution can be found that is satisfactory to all parties. At the same time, the Portuguese community in Shanghai is increasingly concerned about the election of the Municipal Council and hopes that Portuguese representatives can occupy a seat on the board. It is heard that there are 6,000 Portuguese in Shanghai, one of the oldest expatriate communities in Shanghai. Many Portuguese reside in Shanghai for life. The Portuguese community believes that there are several people who may be nominated as candidates, including Mr. De Weili, a lawyer (De Weili Law Firm), Mr. Lu Li (Lu Li Company), and Mr. Su Chai (Jardine Matheson).

Evolution of the Allocation of Positions on the Municipal Council

According to records, the Municipal Council has had one German director since 1873. In 1911, Mr. F. Fitger, the manager of the German-Chinese Bank, served as a German director and was re-elected until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Mr. Jecierski, the manager of the Russo-Asiatic Bank, succeeded Fitger as a director until the end of 1918, when the German director position was abolished. It was then stipulated that there would be seven British directors, and one director each for the United States and Japan. The following year, the number of US directors was increased to two. In 1927, the number of Japanese directors was also increased to two, and the number of British directors was reduced to five, which has been maintained to this day. The Japanese community first decided to nominate a director to the Municipal Council in 1916, with six British directors, and one director each for the United States, Japan, and Russia.

### Western Newspapers Express Anxiety About the Situation in Shanghai; Shanghai Is Likely to Become Japan's Property

Yesterday's editorial in the English-language "China Press" discussed the agreement on the change in the number of members on the current Municipal Council, entitled "The Municipal Council Agreement." The article stated: "The Consuls General of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan have proposed that the current Municipal Council should have three seats each for the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, one seat for Germans, and two seats for other nationalities. From this, it is obvious that future disputes will be between the six votes of the British and American groups and the four votes of the German-Japanese Axis group. The German community in this city is overjoyed at the German obtaining this seat, and even Hitler could not have dreamed of it. Therefore, the German director will naturally follow Berlin's instructions for future motions of the Municipal Council, as he is currently in collusion with Japan. As for the four Chinese directors, all kinds of intimidation and threats they will encounter in the future are to be expected, depending on the courage of the individual. In the past, their position was very good, but the future is unpredictable. The other two nationalities seem to hold the voting power of a motion. If the votes of both sides are the same, the chairman will vote. The problem is that the other two nationalities, if they are countries that are on the Allied side, such as Norway or the Netherlands, will naturally take the same attitude as the United Kingdom and the United States when Japan proposes a radical motion. Although in some cases, Hitler may make his country turn around, and the attitude of the people here will also change, which will ultimately help Japan. The people of European countries that are called neutral countries today may become refugees tomorrow. Even the people of countries such as Switzerland, Portugal, or Sweden may join the British and American groups now, but in a few days, they may be forced to be ordered by the Japanese directors. In short, if Japan wants to control the overall situation, the United Kingdom and the United States must pay attention to the selection of these 'other two nationalities' so that they can obtain a majority of votes after joining the chairman's voting rights. We do not know whether the United Kingdom and the United States have made this plan, but the people of this city are already afraid that Shanghai will become Japan's property. We also sympathize with the fact that Japan should have fair representation and a reasonable voice in the Municipal Council. If Japan achieves its goal and jointly abides by the new status quo, then the angry and unfair words from Hamakita will not be heard in the future. If Japan continues to imitate Hitler's behavior, hoping to get another share after having eaten its fill, then we are unwilling to make any more concessions while these matters have not been resolved. Japan should know that there is nowhere to find a willing sacrifice."

### French Concession Reduces Electricity Consumption; Three Fundamental Principles; Electricity for Public Utilities Such as Trolleys Is Not Reduced; Special Important Factories Have Lighter Electricity Reduction

Since the French Water and Electricity Company issued a notice on the 15th of last month, advising commercial and industrial users in the concession to earnestly implement electricity reduction measures. As diesel fuel is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in the future, they should automatically save electricity and reduce consumption. Electricity consumption for road signs, neon lights, and other similar types should be saved, and the company has decided to stop supplying electricity for such city signs. It also stipulates that commercial and industrial households should reduce electricity consumption by 30% of their consumption in the same month last year within a possible range, for users who use more than 500 degrees. This is a temporary measure to save electricity.

Fundamental Measures

The fundamental measures for electricity reduction on the company side are being studied by the Electricity Saving Committee established by the French Municipal Council and the company authorities. First, efforts will be made to eliminate electric heating. Second, non-essential electricity consumption for commerce and industry will also be eliminated after detailed investigation. Third, the company will take practical measures to reduce the overall electricity supply in the concession by 30% compared to the same month last year. These three items are the fundamental principles of electricity saving. The method for dividing paper will be discussed and determined at a meeting within days.

Amount of Electricity Reduction

The largest electricity consumers in the concession recently are larger factories, such as cotton mills, silk mills, rubber factories, egg processing factories, cold storage factories, flour mills, and bakeries. Although it has been decided to reduce electricity consumption in the concession by 30% in the future, the electricity reduction for flour mills, bakeries, and cold storage factories will be lighter, while the electricity reduction for other factories that are not particularly important will be heavier. Commercial and industrial stores will be divided according to their electricity consumption. Households that consume electricity sparingly are also expected to reduce it as much as possible. Public utilities such as trolleys will continue to use the original amount of electricity and will not be reduced.

Advising on Savings

The company has now limited the use of electricity by the largest consumers in the concession. However, because the procedures for household electricity consumption are cumbersome and investigations are time-consuming, there are no measures in place yet. The company hopes that users will understand the company's difficulties in maintaining operations and will save electricity automatically and reduce consumption as much as possible so that the company can overcome the difficult period. Electricity reduction measures are for the benefit of the citizens and are a matter for the entire society. If the source of diesel fuel is cut off in the future and the company cannot maintain operations, the citizens will suffer even more. Therefore, it is hoped that the citizens of the concession will enthusiastically support it.

Diesel Inventory

The company currently consumes more than 1,000 tons of diesel fuel per month, all of which is purchased from foreign countries through foreign merchants. The quantity has decreased compared to before the electricity reduction. As for the diesel inventory, it is sufficient for several months of use. Therefore, the electricity reduction is indeed very necessary. At present, there are 500 user households in the city, among which the largest consumers are Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, Maochang Air Conditioning Company, Jingxin Dyeing Factory, and cotton and silk factories. When reporters inquired about the fact that the French Concession's electricity supply was not sufficient and a few users had to purchase from the Shanghai Power Company of the Public Concession, it was stated that this had been the case for ten years.

### Stabilizing Civilian Food Supply: Addressing Both Root Causes and Symptoms

Yesterday, according to responsible authorities, the two administrations have now categorized and discussed methods, deciding to address both the root causes and symptoms, to clear domestic and foreign rice and grain sources. In addition, the buying and selling between rice merchants and firms will also be reorganized, and may be announced soon.

Allocation of Ordered Rice

The Shanghai Food Grain Cooperative Association is actively seeking ways to clear and transport and allocate all rice orders that have been completed to various subscribers. The fourth batch of ordered rice has already arrived at the port in separate shipments. The first batch of 485 bags arrived here on March 18th, and the second batch of 488 bags arrived here on March 28th. 464 bags have now been allocated. As for those who have registered, a total of 2,108 households have registered a total of 11,570 bags; the deal has not been completed.

Public Warehouse Payment Demand

The Public Warehouse Management Committee is authorized to store 200,000 bags of rice, of which 80,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice have already been transacted. The rice may be shipped to Shanghai by ship in early May for storage. The committee is making every effort to urge those who have already confirmed the amount but have not paid. It is known that (1) the money exchange industry has not paid for 10,000 bags; (2) the cotton industry has not replied to the letter urging payment for 2,000 bags; (3) Hua Cheng has not fully paid for 2,000 bags; (4) Nanyang has been asked to subscribe to 2,000 bags, but no reply has been received; (5) the paper industry was previously asked to subscribe to 4,000 bags, accounting for half of 170,000 yuan, but no reply has been received; (6) although the machinery and textile industry has confirmed the amount, it has not fully paid, and the committee will send another letter to urge payment.

Decline in Foreign Rice Prices

Since the authorities of the two concessions have taken active measures to stabilize the overall food supply in the city, general goods holders are alarmed, fearing that foreign rice sources will flood in and rice prices will turn to a sharp decline. At that time, they will inevitably suffer unexpected losses, and the so-called assessment has been virtually cancelled, which obviously has no constraints. Therefore, they have successively put stockpiled goods on the market, and the spot market for foreign rice has increased. After the rice market opened yesterday, people's hearts were extremely stable, and the market situation has improved compared with the previous market. As a result, domestic and foreign rice and grain diverge: (1) foreign rice has fallen by about two yuan compared with the previous market; (2) domestic rice has risen by one yuan compared with the previous market.

### Guo Shun in Shanghai, Rumored to Still Go to Hong Kong

The Municipal Council Chinese Director Guo Shun was rumored to have left Shanghai for Hong Kong. However, according to the Datong News Agency reporter, Guo is still in Shanghai, but may indeed leave Shanghai soon. The Datong News Agency reporter also visited Guo's residence at 1400 Jing'an Temple Road yesterday morning, and the security was very strict. There were many detectives stationed outside the house. Guo's family members said that Guo had not left Shanghai, but refused to see any guests. According to another source, Guo will indeed leave Shanghai for Hong Kong soon.

### Former French Consul General O'Ren Transferred to Turkey

The Continental News reported that the former French Consul General in Shanghai, O'Ren, has been appointed as the French Consul General in Istanbul, Turkey. O'Ren left Shanghai half a year ago, and his successor is Major Mattel.

### Municipal Council Approves the Issuance of Hotel and Restaurant Licenses

The Municipal Council Police Committee held its annual license meeting on the 21st of last month to review 42 applications for the issuance of annual hotel, tavern, restaurant (兼售酒類 - which also sell alcohol), and beer sales licenses, of which 13 were related to Chinese people. After review, it was considered that the applications were generally in compliance and should be approved or recognized, but the licensees must comply with the regulations of various departments of the Municipal Council before they can proceed. The list is as follows: (1) Hotel category: Applicant name: Zhang Gongda, Address: 678 Hankou Road; (2) Tavern category: Zheng Wei Xian, 447 Yu Qiaqing Road; Zhou Yongwei, 988 Fuxu Road; Wu Ji, 577 Jing'an Temple Road; Feng Meiting, 1193 Jing'an Temple Road; (3) Restaurant category: Zhong Junzhun, 691 Nanjing Road; Li Ze, 720 Nanjing Road; Cui Guichen, 748 Nanjing Road; Zhang Shankun, 280-600 Jing'an Temple Road; (4) Beer sales category: Dou Gansheng, 150 Guangdong Road; Yin Shichang, 858-860 Guangxi Road; Da Sanyuan, 679 Nanjing Road; Yu Guoying, 858-860 Fuxu Road. In addition, the renewal of the said licenses should also be approved together. The case was approved at the regular meeting of the Municipal Council Board of Directors on the 2nd of this month.

### Soviet Merchant Ships Travel Frequently: The Folkov Enters the Port

The Soviet merchant ship Folkov arrived at the port from Vladivostok at 3:00 pm yesterday. After entering the port, it berthed at floating pontoon numbers 22 and 23. After berthing in Shanghai for two days, it will leave the port. The destination has not been determined. Soviet merchant ships have been traveling frequently recently, which is unprecedented after the Shanghai war.

### American Economic Expert Comments on Japan's Wartime Economy: Unable to Solve Internal and External Difficulties, Lower Standard of Living Makes Further Squeezing Impossible

American renowned economic expert, Roepke, recently published an article in Newsweek analyzing Japan's economic situation. His conclusion is that the end result will be that Japan will ultimately fail.

Modern Warfare Based on Economy

According to Roepke, among the world powers participating in the war, Japan's wartime economic problems best demonstrate that economic problems in modern warfare are indeed decisive. The lessons learned by Japan can be used as a warning to other countries.

England and Germany Solved Difficulties

The main economic problems of the current war are how to increase the country's production for Germany, and how to purchase goods from abroad for England. Japan must solve both internal and external difficulties at the same time. Germany and England, the former has solved the production problem by relying on its strict management, and the latter has no difficulty in purchasing the goods it needs by relying on its wealth, so the difficulties have also been solved.

Japan Still at a Loss

Japan is still at a loss. First, let's talk about Japan's domestic production problem. Japan also adopted control methods, but its main equipment is not good, and it is impossible to improve it. Compared with German skilled workers, its labor force is far behind, and its standard of living is very low, and it cannot be further squeezed for military use. Therefore, although Japan has tried to imitate the example of Germany to increase domestic production, I am afraid that it will not be very effective.

Failed to Obtain Foreign Loans

Speaking of purchasing goods from abroad, Japan cannot be compared with England. Japan has neither a large amount of gold and foreign wine reserves, nor can it obtain credit loans from foreign countries. Under such circumstances, it is not difficult for discerning people to imagine what kind of results Japan will encounter. (From the upcoming Millard's Review)

### Traffic Police Added Near the Rising Sun Building

In order to improve the traffic situation on various roads in the Public Concession and for safety reasons, the Municipal Council Police Department has actively strengthened traffic management on various important roads. Recently, eight patrolmen with the "Traffic" badge were sent to Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road (near the Rising Sun Building) to assist in directing traffic and instructing vehicles and pedestrians. Vehicles or pedestrians on intersecting roads are not allowed to cross when the green light is on. This strengthened management method has achieved remarkable results in increasing vehicle speed and strengthening pedestrian safety. Therefore, it will be promoted separately on various important roads.

### Salvation Army Leader Brigadier Beraie Morris Scheduled to Leave Shanghai, All Circles Give Farewell Banquets, Morris to Broadcast Tonight

Brigadier Beraie Morris, the leader of the Shanghai Salvation Army, has been in office for six years and has been ordered to be transferred to Canada for service. He is scheduled to leave with his wife on the Democratic Radio Station (call sign XMCH) at 9:00 pm today (the 4th) to bid farewell to Shanghai friends. Morris will lead his wife and son Wesley on the President Cleveland liner to Kobe on the morning of the 8th, and then go to Seattle. The location of his service in Canada is not yet known. All circles in this city have a lot of friendship with Morris and have given farewell banquets for him.

Relief for Refugees Faces Difficulties

Morris attended the Rotary Club and gave a speech, expressing his deep gratitude to all circles in the city for helping the Salvation Army to relieve refugees. Morris said that in the 70 years since the Salvation Army was established, the social work it has worked on has never been as difficult as dealing with the refugee problem after the Shanghai war. After the war, no less than 68,000 refugees moved to Shanghai. Thanks to the hard work of various groups, the problem was solved. This move has made a great contribution to Shanghai. He said that he was reluctant to leave Shanghai, but he firmly believed that various groups in Shanghai could continue to work hard to solve the beggar problem, and asked the public not to give alms to street beggars. Morris said that he will leave Shanghai on the President Cleveland liner next Tuesday (the 8th), and his successor, Walker, will come to Shanghai from Tianjin after Easter.

### Tailoring Workers Resumed Work Yesterday, Moving Companies Resumed Business, Garment Industry Strikes Again

The workers of the Western clothing stores on Sichuan Road North Road in the Public Concession and Xiafei Road in the French Concession have implemented strikes because of improving treatment and demanding that employers increase wages. Now it is known that the labor and management parties are gradually approaching. Starting yesterday morning, the labor party has officially resumed work first, and then discuss the conditions. Therefore, the three Western clothing stores on Sichuan Road, Hubei Road, and Xiafei Road all opened as usual yesterday.

The labor unrest of Shanghai Moving Company was also resolved last night, so it has also resumed work.

The Shanghai and Su-Guang garment makers have recently announced to the work supervisors and stewards that they will increase wages by 50% and a meal allowance of one yuan per person per day because the cost of living has been increasing day by day and wages are not enough to cover expenses. The work supervisors and stewards did not accept it, so some workers have started to strike, and forced other workers who have not stopped working to participate.

### Conte Verde Fuel Replenishment Completed, Rumors of Sneaking Out Yesterday, But the Italian Postal Shipping Company Denied It

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that although the Italian Postal Shipping Company in this city has denied that its Conte Verde ship will be transferred, it is rumored today (the 3rd) that the ship will indeed sneak out tomorrow (the 4th) or at the end of this week. It is verified that the Conte Verde is a giant ship that burns oil. Since Italy's participation in the war in June last year, it has been trapped in Shanghai. It is believed that the ship has gradually prepared the fuel necessary for exporting. According to the beginning of the European War in 1939, the Ramses ship of the German Henmei Shipping Company, which was trapped in Shanghai, secretly left Shanghai last Saturday, and it is not known where it went.

Italian Post Office Company Denied Yesterday

The Continental News reported that the staff of the Italian Postal Shipping Company in this city denied yesterday morning that the company's Conte Verde would follow in the footsteps of the German ship Rheimsass and leave Shanghai. Although it is rumored that the ship will leave Shanghai for Kobe, the ship was still berthed near Yangshupu Lan Road as of last night. The ship remained in Shanghai after Italy's participation in the war. According to the company's staff, the ship will continue to stay in Shanghai and leave after the end of the European War. When the reporter asked whether the Axis powers are now ordering Italian ships to leave the ports of South America, and whether this order will be extended to Shanghai, the staff replied that it is technically difficult to implement this method in Shanghai.

### Children's Day and Common Sense of Child Rearing

The Children's Day of the thirtieth year is launched again in a warm mood. Although the ways of celebration are different every year, the meaning of celebration is not consistent. People in society have been progressing year by year in their understanding of this kind of movement; and those who participate in child care work are also increasing day by day. The long-term plan of cultivating people for a hundred years is truly a phenomenon of social progress and a sign of the revival of our national country. The author often likes to repeatedly state the common sense of child rearing for parents. At this festival, I hope that all children in the country have healthy bodies. I will contribute one or two to the parents of the world as far as my humble opinions are concerned.

(1) To avoid the spread of diseases, children's body tissues are delicate and their resistance to germs is weak, so they are easily infected with diseases. Therefore, first, do not allow them to approach anyone who is sick, and do not go to crowded places. Nannies and caregivers of children must choose healthy people. If the mother or nanny occasionally has a cold and cough, she should use a towel or mouth cover to cover her mouth when breastfeeding. Never use your mouth to face the child's mouth or kiss the child. Do not give the child food that has been chewed in your mouth, that is even more unhygienic. The pacifiers and toys used by children daily must be washed and cleaned before they can be put into the mouth. If parents have lung disease after the child is born, they should be immediately isolated. When a person coughs or sneezes, they must cover their mouth with a towel or palm. Do not spit sputum everywhere. Injecting 5% carbolic acid water into the spittoon can kill tuberculosis bacteria and prevent infection of others. Patients must have disease morality. The so-called "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Extra attention should be paid to a young and weak infant.

(2) Take more fresh air and sunlight. In the weather of gentle breeze and bright sunshine, even a child who is only one month old can be taken to the public garden to live outdoors for two hours every day. It is often seen that people are often afraid of children being exposed to the wind. Because of the fear of the wind, even the air in the bedroom is not allowed to circulate. Half of the diseases are even more tightly closed windows and heavy curtains. In fact, as long as we wear a hat on our head and wear warm clothes on our body, even if cold air blows in and enters the lungs through the nasal cavity and trachea, the cold air has become warm from cold, and it does not make people catch cold, nor does it cause a cold because of this. The reason for catching a cold is definitely not here. When the author was in Germany before, I saw a child with measles (commonly known as getting the rash) who also suffered from pneumonia. They wrapped the child's head and body warmly and placed him in the corridor or garden. Because there was sufficient fresh air, the pneumonia healed in a few days, and the measles was of course no problem. Under such air, measles lung tuberculosis (commonly known as rash tuberculosis) will certainly not be there. When Chinese people hear this situation, they may think I am talking in my sleep, but this is obviously a fact. Some people say that Europeans are different from Chinese people in physique, but based on the actual situation, given the high mortality rate of measles in Chinese children, we should also improve and improve, and try to get some fresh air as much as possible! In 1934, there were two twins in a pediatric hospital in Vienna who had whooping cough at the same time. The doctor took one child without any medication and placed him in the open air, while the other child was locked in the house and only used medication. As a result, the one who was in the open air all day recovered quickly. Furthermore, from the statistics of hundreds of children, when they arrived in the countryside, in the embrace of nature, their weight increased day by day. When they arrived in the city, even if they ate tonics every day, their weight still decreased. These all give us clear proof that air and sunlight are indispensable to us humans, just like fish to water.

(3) What is nutrition? Sufficient nutrition can make oneself generate resistance and reduce diseases, but in this year of soaring prices, we should also take into account the economic aspect, so meat is too expensive, you can eat spinach tofu instead, milk is too expensive, you can eat soy milk instead, fruit is too expensive, you can use Su Ying soup instead. Do not only care about what you like to eat, but forget the original quality of nutrition. If a child who is one year old or almost two years old is still only eating breast milk, this is not the way to truly love the child. That kind of one-sided nutrition can make the child fall into a very weak place, and therefore diseases arise. A child who is one month old can be given orange juice every day in addition to breast milk (tomato juice and vegetable soup can also be used instead) and boiled water. A child who is two or three months old can be given cod liver oil (for four to six weeks). After five or six months, add a paste-like food every day, such as porridge, yam, spinach, pig liver, etc., which can be made into a paste and fed. Then, after ten months, they will naturally be weaned. When a person is sick, they should also pay attention to nutrition during illness. Most families usually only care about eating indiscriminately. Once they have a fever or get sick, they stop eating everything. In fact, when people have a fever, the consumption of vitamins and various nutrients is very high, and it is necessary to have a corresponding supplement in order to resist diseases. Folk customs are very strict in restricting the food of children with measles, and they also say that they must eat forty days of pure vegetarian food, so that nutrition is lacking, and diseases such as tuberculosis take advantage of the deficiency. Therefore, when you are sick, you should also listen to the doctor's instructions and pay attention to nutrition. Generally speaking, all light, fluid, fresh, nutritious and easily digestible foods can still be eaten. Children's food not only provides for their lives, but also develops their bodies, which is more important than adults.

Love my love and the love of others, young my young and the young of others. I hope that those in the world whose children are well and have enough food and clothing will do what I can to help children who are without clothes or food and who are sick. Although Children's Day is only one day a year, the days we need to work hard are always endless. What do you think of the virtuous parents? (Su Zengxiang)

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

I recently read a news item in your paper regarding the arrest of a retired military officer, which mentioned a Mr. Zhou residing at No. 120 Ladu Road. Upon investigation, the above address is where I reside, and no one named Zhou has ever lived in this house. I am concerned that this may lead to misinformation. Therefore, I am writing this letter to clarify the situation and respectfully request that you make a correction.

Sincerely,
Chen Gengchu

### Children's Education

— Jue Hui

Children's Day—a day for children; however, "adults" should also be given a mention.

As the saying goes, "It is the father's fault if children are not educated." If education is absurd, it is even "more of a fault" than "not educating" at all!

Often, children do not even know who the national leader is or why there is a war; however, they know exactly what a hula dance is or the one hundred and several dozen tiles in mahjong. If this continues, alas!

It's fine if they are not educated and don't understand; but if they are educated absurdly, although they understand, they understand the wrong path, not the right path.

Not understanding is just not understanding; understanding the wrong path means the child's life is over!

Furthermore: "If the teacher is not strict, he is lazy." There are many primary school teachers who are "serving the public on an empty stomach" these days... (Those who are "adults" will naturally know the rest.)

Children are innocent and unformed, and they will learn whatever they are taught. If taught well, they will achieve great things; if taught poorly, it will be dangerous!

Especially the "wealthy adults," I hope they will think this over again and again!

### Sending Children to Nursery School

— Ping Niang

She is a teacher and a writer, but she has three children under school age at home. What can this allow her to do? After teaching, she comes home to find either a big child with a broken head or a little one with a stomachache. Although each child has a nanny or wet nurse, they lack both hygiene and education, and they are bound to be lazy and negligent, or even abuse them, behind the mistress's back. Her husband often teases her, saying, "She sacrifices her own field to cultivate others' fields," and sometimes even laughs at her for "being fond of being a teacher." In this environment, she had no choice but to give up her beloved students and sacrifice her career for her children.

So she stayed at home, thinking she could at least engage in writing. But look at her writing career: as soon as she picked up her pen, the two-year-old child who loved to follow his mother cried, "Mommy, Mommy." He took the pen and climbed onto the desk, asking Mom for paper to write on. Just when she gave him paper and ordered him to write at his small table (actually scribbling), the wet nurse brought the crying little one, who insisted on being close to Mom. Just when she got rid of them, the big child brought picture books and asked Mom to tell him stories. Thus, the three children kept coming to her one after another, and how could she write a single word? She remembered what her friend told her: Du Jun worked hard at writing, and her book on women's issues was written with three or four children surrounding her, and she was financially strapped, without a nanny to take care of the children. I didn't have any children around me at that time, so I didn't find it strange. Now that I think about it, it was a miracle! Maybe my friend made up that story to encourage me to write. Otherwise, unless those children were so oppressed that they were like wooden chickens.

She was unwilling to have her life ruined by her children. Although some people would try to comfort her with the words, "Household matters are as important as social affairs," and "Educating your children is the same as engaging in education in society, and the achievements are not small," she felt that those were just self-deprecating words!

She sent her eldest child to kindergarten—a kindergarten that emphasizes play and does not focus on rote learning. The three-year-old was treated as a four-year-old. The person who took care of him was only responsible for picking him up and dropping him off. Economically, it only increased expenses, and it did not reduce the need for a servant, but the mother felt that she had relieved some of the entanglement. This went on for a year.

Now the biggest problem is the second one. He can move freely and wants to turn everything over, whether it's Dad's or Mom's. Because he spilled tea, he broke the teacup; because he wanted to dress up after washing his face, he spilled all the snow cream and talcum powder on the floor; because he wanted a haircut, he smeared Vaseline all over his head, face, and palms; because he wanted to put the nickel into the piggy bank, his mother's purse was constantly being robbed; because he fought with his older brother and younger brother, he cried and shouted; because he was raised by his grandmother to eat candy and snacks, he was constantly clamoring for something to eat; because he was raised by his father to not listen unless beaten, he was not easily persuaded by kind words. Everyone says he is the naughtiest, but his mother is quite sympathetic to him, understands him, and spends more time dealing with him. Therefore, sending one away did not help the mother.

Coincidentally, the YWCA founded a "childcare center for working women." She felt that although she could not be considered a working woman, it was precisely because the child problem was not resolved that she was stuck at home. She was not willing to have her life ruined by her children, but the children were too young and there was nowhere to send them. Now that there was a childcare center, she could solve the problem of the child who was the most troublesome. So, she signed up first.

He entered the center at the age of two years and four months, just the right age, and his health was quite good. On March 1st, he left early and returned late, just like a primary school student. (He doesn't understand what a childcare center is, he only knows that he's going to school.) The mother really felt liberated when she sent the two children out every day. She could look at picture books, write regularly, and occasionally hug and play with the youngest one, which could serve as an adjustment to her busy life.

She sometimes felt sorry: perhaps this child's troubles were now on the heads of the childcare center teachers. But after a week, two weeks, three weeks, it was said that this child did not require them to spend too much effort at the childcare center. They liked him very much, and he was happy to go. This mother truly felt relieved of a worry.

### Warning

— Ling Tong

According to astronomical measurements: not only is the rainy season starting early this year, but the flooding is especially severe, the most in decades. This humid air contains a substance that easily damages everything, and the color often turns black, making it impossible to clean. Liquids, solids, and gases cannot resist it, and it is not advisable to store anything. For rice and other grains containing water, chemical reactions will cause other changes to occur. (See this paper's March 28th issue, fully copied, hereby declared.)

### The Responsibility of Being Parents: Thoughts on Children's Day

— Xu Daming

There is no parent who does not love their children. However, the methods of showing love are obviously different. Some focus on providing expensive food, clothing, and taking children to play everywhere as a way of showing love; others add spiritual love—education—to the above two kinds of material love. Of course, the two are practically inseparable, because enjoying play is another kind of "education" that is easier for children to remember, and this kind of "education" often has good results, especially when parents treat their children as "treasures" and "darlings," and children are receptive to it. Moreover, most parents almost completely ignore the importance of family education, and often push all the responsibility of education onto the school. It seems that children only receive instruction from teachers at school, and parents bear no responsibility at all. Therefore, children do whatever they want at home, and the connection between school and home is lost. This phenomenon must be overcome today, because it is a loss for children!

Secondly, the family must not only establish contact with the school so that their children can make real progress, but also play another role in the middle—supervising the teachers so that they cannot be careless about children's education, because parents' inquiries will force teachers to pay attention to everything about the children, and the effect is also to help the children. Furthermore, if parents have a clearer understanding, they can use this opportunity to become familiar with whether a teacher's thinking is correct, whether the teaching methods need to be improved, etc.; if a teacher's thinking is problematic, parents can jointly propose an impeachment. This is a way to promote the spirit of democracy, and parents must take this responsibility for the future of their children.

Thirdly, I once saw an illustration in this paper depicting the "family education" that children receive at home: the method of teaching mathematics is "mahjong" (the characters for one to nine of ten thousands, circles, etc.), and the teaching aids for English lessons are "playing cards" (A.K.Q.J., etc.). So adults gamble, and children watch by the side, and some parents even teach their children what this is and what that is.

We must protest against such parents. This is definitely not a way to make children learn well. On the contrary, it is ruining your children's future. Such parents should bear the name of "criminals against children." Then, if teachers hear about this situation from children, the school authorities can also write letters to advise them to respect children's studies as the most important thing.

In short, both schools and parents should have this correct understanding—children belong to the country, to the nation, and they are definitely not your or my own private property. Therefore, if children are good, the whole nation is good, not just your own "money tree." Our education of children is also to fulfill our responsibility to the nation and the country, and this most important premise must be clearly recognized.

As for children who are too poor to go to school, we cannot ignore their education either. Perhaps there are children with very good talents here who are being buried.

Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to speak out for disadvantaged children, hoping that people in society will also consider the education of disadvantaged children as their own business and provide practical assistance—opening more street children's schools, etc., would probably be more useful than spending hundreds of thousands of funds to build a children's library! Moreover, the significance of this kind of thing today far exceeds that of a children's library. I hope that we can quickly extend a hand of sympathy, because this is not only a great gift to children, but also another responsibility of parents!

### Chinese Flowering Crabapple

— Qin Shou'ou

(6) Product of Love

"Husband, but who is my husband? Yuan Baofan, he is only the enemy who killed my mother, how can he be considered my husband! It is true that wealthy people can marry three wives and four concubines, and in our China, it is a matter of course. I cannot forbid him; but if he wants to marry a mistress, he should find her from among those prostitutes and other women of suitable status, and should not defile a maiden from a clean family. Moreover, it is not a matter of mutual consent at all, but he used extremely vile and shameless means to set up a scam, causing my whole family to fall into this trap. Therefore, I feel that I am not only not his wife, but also not his mistress, but a prisoner imprisoned by him! Based on these reasons, late last night, I told...—"

"Ah!" Chinese Flowering Crabapple almost cried out in shock.

"...the spirit of my mother. I lit incense and prayed sincerely before her spirit tablet for dozens of minutes. Now my heart is completely at peace, and I believe that my mother in the underworld must also feel very comforted...!"

Chinese Flowering Crabapple's heart also calmed down, and he couldn't help but breathe a deep sigh of relief: a triumphant smile immediately appeared on his face.

"...! From now on, I hope that you can always treat me like a member of your family. I myself am determined to always love you; as long as there is an opportunity, I will definitely find a way to jump out of the Yuan family's cage...!"

He couldn't help but hug those pages of letters to his chest, cherishing them like a person, before putting them down after a long time to continue reading.

"...Your occupation and environment are different from others, so you must be extra careful in your actions in the future. A person like him will never treat murder as a thing..."

Xiangqi's few words of advice were really not an overestimation. Chinese Flowering Crabapple himself had also heard Yuan Shaowen say that once, one of Yuan Zhenshou's subordinates who handled documents had an affair with a maid in his family, and on the day of discovery, he was shot dead by Yuan Baofan himself with a pistol. Speaking of this person's father, he was still a sworn brother who served as a small soldier with the old Yuan in Baoding! (72)

New Film Introduction

### The Peacock Flies Southeast

— Meng Gongwei

The "historical drama" trend has passed, and I heard that several historical dramas that have been completed or are about to be completed cannot be sold. The adaptation of "The Peacock Flies Southeast" into a modern drama is ahead of the trend.

"The Peacock Flies Southeast" performed in modern dress is very different from the ancient poem "The Peacock Flies Southeast, Turning Back Every Five Li." The difference lies not only in the costumes, but also in the addition and deletion of characters and changes in the plot. The same is only the names of the male and female protagonists and the outline of the story.

The addition and deletion of characters is related to the change in the plot. The little sister-in-law in the original poem is not here, but the uncle Lu Shun and the farmhand A Niu are added. This is for the development of the plot. In my opinion, it doesn't matter to add or delete characters to strengthen the atmosphere or facilitate the development of the plot. The problem lies in whether the spirit of the original work is damaged by adding or deleting characters.

In the case of "The Peacock Flies Southeast," the original poem and the film have two different sentiments: the gentle and sad mood of the original poem is not in the film, but the film expands the field of vision and enhances the social significance. Let's not talk about whether this adaptation method is meritorious or sinful (in my personal opinion, I agree with being faithful to the times rather than being faithful to the original), at least to a limited extent, in the current trend of movies, it has broken away from the false resurrection of putting modern clothes on living corpses. And this so-called modern film of the "false resurrection" type is very likely to become a new trend after "historical dramas."

The original poem of "The Peacock Flies Southeast" is a lament of the weak under the heavy pressure of feudal society. Because of the author's era, it exposes the tragedy advocated by the feudal system and contains anger at the feudal system, but it is only a lament and a call. As for the film "The Peacock Flies Southeast," it has been adapted, and the background of the era has become the present. This is the greatest cleverness and greatest benefit of the adapter. Of course, the current view of the relationship between men and women may have to be revised in a few years, or even it is impossible and there will be no more things like Jiao Zhongqing and Lan Zhi, but comparing the original poem and the film, the viewpoint is much more advanced, and this is also an example that the times are always moving forward.

From the perspective of script writing and directing techniques, "The Peacock Flies Southeast" can also be ranked among the best in recent domestic films. "The Peacock Flies Southeast" was originally a very touching story. With good writing and directing, and with Hu Die, who has been out of the spotlight for a long time, playing the lead role, the box office revenue should be guaranteed.

Hu Die's acting skills in this film are very great. We haven't seen actors with internal performances in domestic films for a long time, but Hu Die has it in this film; we have also felt for a long time that the actor's temperament and the temperament of the character in the play cannot be matched, but Hu Die in this film unifies them.

As for other actors, Wang Wulung is too old and his movements are too exaggerated. Wang Naidong's movements are okay, but his Mandarin is not pure. Gu Wenzong's movements, language, and makeup are too exaggerated. At first glance, it is almost suspected that he is an actor who has been performing Cantonese opera for a long time. It is worth mentioning that Li Jingbo's A Niu and Bai Yin's Cai Lian performed very well.

### The Ideal Cast of Peking Opera Actors Performing the Play "Home"

— Hai

Many Peking opera actors are very interested in plays. The year before last, the actors and cultural figures jointly performed "Thunderstorm" at the Carlton Theatre, which further increased their interest. Originally, they planned to form a "Lonely Devil Troupe" and stipulated that the script for the first performance would be "Parasitic Grass," but it did not materialize, which is a pity.

Ma Jin's "Home" was performed at the Lafayette Theatre, creating a record of 127 full houses. Many actors went to see it and praised the play very much. I think if they could jointly perform "Home," it would definitely cause a sensation, and I have also drafted an ideal cast for them. Yesterday, at the welcome banquet and celebration banquet for the Xun Hui Troupe at the Actors' Union Property Association, I mentioned this matter. Zhou Xinfang, Gao Baisui, Zhao Ruquan, and Li Ruchun all agreed very much and were eager to try.

I will write down the ideal cast of "Home" below as a reference for assigning actors in the future.

### Blood Rain in the Qiong Garden

Chapter 5: Red Skirt Jealousy - Kills Pomegranate Flowers

When Zhou Qiyu, the governor of Yansui, was ordered to suppress the bandits, he was the governor of the five provinces, holding great power, and the momentum of the bandits was also expanding, from Shaanxi to Shanxi, Henan, Huguang, Sichuan and other provinces, attacking and occupying dozens of states and counties, and even the ancient Kuizhou, known as a natural danger, was lost. Zhou Qiyu then went to Junzhou and ordered the four governors of Shaanxi, Henan, etc. to block the bandits on all sides. They won more than a dozen battles, and many bandits died, and their momentum was slightly frustrated. So Zhang Xianzhong fled to Shangluo, and Li Zicheng and others fled into the Chexiang Gorge in Xing'an. Unexpectedly, the Chexiang Gorge was surrounded by steep mountains on all sides, and the middle spanned forty miles. Once inside, it was like being in a box, easy to enter but difficult to exit. When the residents of the mountains learned the news that the bandits had mistakenly entered, they were overjoyed. Some threw down large stones, some threw down torches, and they blocked the entrance of the gorge with stones, so that the bandits' way of life in the gorge was cut off and they were in danger of starvation. In addition, God sent down twenty days of heavy rain, and the bandits' bows and arrows were all taken off, and the horses lacked fodder, and many people died. If they could not get out again, they would starve to death in the gorge. Li Zicheng used the plan of his subordinate strategist and sent someone to risk going out of the gorge to pretend to surrender to Zhou Qiyu's camp. Zhou Qiyu made many great achievements and inevitably became arrogant, and in order to settle the matter as soon as possible, he rashly agreed, so more than 36,000 bandits were able to survive. Zhou Qiyu was about to compile and send them back to farming, but how did he know that as soon as the bandits left the gorge, they suddenly rioted and killed all the officials who had come to appease them, and they rekindled the flames and rebelled again. This was the first time. At another time, when Zhang Xianzhong's troops secretly attacked Nanyang, they happened to meet Zuo Liangyu, and the two sides fought fiercely. Xianzhong could not defeat them and led his troops to escape, but he was chased by Zuo Liangyu. The two horses were not far apart. Zuo Liangyu drew his bow and shot an arrow, which hit Zhang Xianzhong's eyebrow, and another arrow hit his middle finger. Xianzhong had no choice but to turn his horse to resist, but Zuo Liangyu slashed him in the face with a knife, and blood flowed to his shoulder, and he almost fell off his horse. At that time, Sun Kewang, a subordinate of Xianzhong, stepped forward to block him and rescued Xianzhong. Liangyu pursued him to Gucheng, and Xianzhong then asked Supervisor Xiong Wencan to surrender. Liangyu knew that the bandits were deceitful, so he offered Xiong Wencan a plan to lure all the bandits to kill them and prevent future troubles. Who knew that Xiong Wencan was bound by the theory of benevolence and righteousness and believed that killing surrendering people was unlucky, so he refused to listen to Liangyu's words. Later, as expected, Zhang Xianzhong supported his troops and did not obey the dispatch, and rebelled again in Gucheng. This was the second time he missed the opportunity. It shows that the governor's troops were mediocre and incompetent, and the main appeasement was in debt. (29)

### The Philosophy of a Life of Struggle

— Zong Yu

Struggle requires sacrifice, that is inevitable; but sacrifice must be necessary, sacrifice must have returns. When there is no need to sacrifice, never sacrifice lightly; sacrifice is waste. It is best to sacrifice one part and reap ten parts; at the very least, the sacrifice should be equal to the harvest.
