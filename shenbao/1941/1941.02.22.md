### U.S. Acknowledges Situation Increasingly Grave, Decides to Strengthen Far East Air Force Strength; Britain Suggests to U.S. Striking at Japanese Economic Institutions, Expanding Embargo to Cut Off Japanese Military Raw Material Sources

Washington - The strengthening of American air power in the Pacific is the subject of much discussion today, reportedly due to General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army, making a statement yesterday at the Senate Military Committee. According to reports, General Marshall told the committee that the Army Department would transfer some rapid descent bombers and other aircraft to the Navy, enabling the Navy Department's Pacific Fleet aircraft carriers to reach wartime strength. General Marshall argued that the situation in the Far East prompted this action and said, "The United States should be prepared to deal with any eventuality." He said that the number of aircraft transferred would be less than one hundred. It is reported that he did not mention the Philippine issue. He expressed optimism about the possibility of British victory and satisfaction with the progress of the U.S. defense program. (International News Service, 21st)

Washington - It was learned here yesterday that U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall reported in a closed session of the Senate Military Committee that the United States and Britain are rushing to dispatch aircraft to strengthen the Pacific air defenses. As to where the U.S. aircraft will be sent, General Marshall refused to announce. It is widely believed that Singapore is the destination. Reports also suggest that some aircraft will be sent to defend Hong Kong, the most advanced British outpost in the Far East. It is asserted that the Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong (transliteration) is highly usable. After the closed session, it was reported that the plan is being given careful consideration through "full cooperation" between British and American military leaders. (International News Service, 21st)

Washington - Well-informed sources said last night that a large batch of U.S. patrol bombers, ordered by the British from the United States, will be rushed across the Pacific to strengthen Singapore's air defenses. It is rumored that Australian pilots will secretly transport these forty-ton engine patrol bombers, via Honolulu, Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam. The British Purchasing Commission declined to comment on this matter. (International News Service, 21st)

Washington - Today, the British Embassy announced that aircraft would fly from the west coast of the United States to the Far East, thus confirming the rumors that aircraft are crossing the Pacific to the Far East. The Embassy declined to release details. (Reuters, 21st)

London - Reliable sources report that Britain has proposed several methods to prevent Japan from stockpiling large quantities of materials to prepare for war against democratic countries. This plan has been delivered to Hopkins, President Roosevelt's personal representative, for his consideration and is currently under review in the White House. Britain has specifically emphasized its unwillingness to provoke Japan. The outline is as follows: (1) The United States, the Philippines, the British Empire, and Allied colonies should strictly limit exports to Japan to the amount of peacetime needs or less. (2) The United States should impose an indirect restriction on Japanese imports, i.e., the American shipping available to Japan, especially oil tankers, must be reduced to peacetime levels or less. (3) The United States should purchase large quantities of important raw materials from South American countries, which would strike at Japanese purchasing in that region. (4) The United States should allow Britain to establish contraband inspection stations in the Caribbean Sea, which would allow Britain to further control important raw materials shipped from South America through the Panama Canal to the Far East. It is reported that the British government pointed out to Hopkins that the United States has already completely prohibited the shipment of a small number of items, such as aviation gasoline, to Japan, but various other oils and cotton, lead, minerals, etc., are not subject to the embargo. At the same time, Britain has restricted a very wide range of items to Japan, only allowing exports to the extent of Japan's peacetime needs. Therefore, Britain suggests that British policy should echo that of the United States, and that the United States and the Philippines should also limit exports to Japan to peacetime levels. The significance of this is that the United States would expand its export licensing system and extend it to the Philippines. It is also reported that the British government told Hopkins that if U.S. oil tankers and U.S.-controlled oil tankers, such as Panamanian ships, ceased oil shipments to Japan, Japan's import capacity would be greatly reduced.

Dutch East Indies Strengthens Defenses, Prepares for Scorched-Earth Warfare

Manila - The Dutch East Indies is today closely watching Japanese activities in southern French Indochina, believing that Japan's establishment of naval and air bases near Saigon is a sufficient threat to the security of the Dutch East Indies, as it is very convenient to attack the rich oil well region of Borneo from Saigon. Authorities have taken various measures that, should the enemy land, the authorities will destroy the oil wells in the area, turning what the enemy gains into a desolate forest. There are currently twelve American instructors in the Soerabaja area teaching the Dutch how to operate new seaplanes. The authorities have also increased taxes to strengthen the war machine. Companies in Java must pay a tax of 40%, while the people pay 25%. The Dutch still hope that the U.S. Navy will assist in the defense of the islands should the enemy invade, but officials solemnly declare that they do not completely rely on outside forces. In fact, foreign aid is not included in the authorities' defense plans. Every able-bodied man in the area is assigned to a military unit for several hours of training each week, and some faint under the hot sun. The Batavia government is also trying to purchase American military equipment to bolster its defenses. As for negotiations with Japan, both sides are currently waiting for the right moment. The previous exchange was merely an exchange of memorandums, and both sides are waiting for the other to take new action. (United Press, 21st)

### Japan's Nerve War Against Britain and the United States: Soviet Newspaper Exposes Its Weaknesses

Moscow - The Soviet Red Star newspaper commented on the weaknesses of Japan's nerve war against Britain and the United States, and compared Japan's military preparations with its southern advance plans. It stated that the vulnerability in these preparations has recently been pointed out by Mr. Hirao, Chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations. Mr. Hirao published a warning, explaining the extent to which Japanese war equipment depends on overseas supplies. From Hirao's article, it can be seen that the purpose of the statements made by Japanese diplomats in their special nerve war against Britain and the United States is solely to compare these statements with the reported activities of Japanese militarists. Foreign observers feel that the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the military are acting independently of each other. (Reuters, 20th)

Britain Concentrates Forces to Defend Far East Fortress

New York - International News Service reporter Kipling recently made the following statement: "I recently learned the secret of Singapore, and know that Britain will resolutely use its remaining strength from the European war to fully defend Singapore. I also know that British officials attach great importance to the security of the area. If the British had to choose between losing Singapore and Gibraltar, the British would rather give up Gibraltar. I have had the opportunity to learn about the defense projects of this British Far East fortress. This defense has recently been greatly strengthened by the arrival of Australian troops. From what I have seen, it is sufficient to prove that the British will concentrate their forces in one area, guarding the key area of Singapore to deal with all eventualities." (International News Service, 21st)

Washington - Naval military experts here said yesterday that Japan may be able to capture Singapore, but the cost would outweigh the benefits. Navy personnel said that any Japanese attempt to seize the British naval base in the Far East, even if there were no British ships nearby, would cost the Japanese a great price. Even if Japan were to succeed in its attempt to occupy it, it would be unable to develop it. However, experts believe that if Britain does not send a powerful navy to protect Singapore, the Japanese navy would have the ability to blockade the island. For the Japanese, the best strategy would be to plunge the island into famine and force it to surrender. If the Japanese are willing to pay a heavy price, they can also capture it by force. (United Press, 21st)

Manila - Yesterday, another 500 American soldiers arrived here on the "Grant," followed by 142 American officers arriving in the Philippines. It has not been disclosed whether they are here for troop rotation or reinforcement. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)

Rumor of Japanese Ultimatum to Thailand and Vietnam, Southern Advance Becomes More Blatant

London - The London "Daily Express" reported yesterday that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has issued "ultimatums" to French Indochina and Thailand, demanding "unrestricted facilities" for Japanese land, sea, and air forces in Thai and Vietnamese territory. According to the "Daily Express," these demands were made after a special meeting of the Japanese wartime cabinet. The newspaper said that Tokyo claims that Britain's reinforcement of Singapore and the Malay Peninsula is intended to prepare for an attack on Thailand. This statement from Tokyo is adopting the style of Hitler before his aggression. (News from Tokyo states that a government spokesman believes that the landing of Australian troops in Singapore is "another proof" that the British know the Far East situation is very critical. Also, according to the London Daily Express, more than half of the Japanese air force on the Asian continent has been concentrated on Hainan Island, Vietnam, and Guangdong Province. Japanese landing troops are also moving south, preparing to take action in Vietnam and Thailand. (International News Service, 20th)

Bangkok - The Thai Foreign Ministry has denied rumors that Japan has requested various military facilities from Thailand. Authoritative sources said that Thailand will reject any request of a military nature from any party. (United Press, 21st)

New York - Dow Jones News Service received a telegram from Shanghai stating that, according to confirmed news, Japanese troops are being transported from Taiwan and mainland Japan to the south, either to Hainan or northern Vietnam. (Reuters, 21st)

Bangkok - Reliable sources report that Japan will station fifteen Japanese warships near the French naval port of Kompong Som in Thailand and Vietnam during the armistice negotiations, which is half of the Japanese South Seas Fleet. The other half is patrolling offshore Saigon. (United Press, 21st)

Tokyo - A Japanese dispatch from Bangkok states that French Vietnamese troops bombarded Thai troops near the Salankiel and Sophie areas on the eastern border of Vietnam yesterday morning. Japanese sources said that the French forces were encouraged to attack the Thai army after receiving aircraft from Britain, thus violating the French-Thai armistice conditions. (United Press, 21st)

Editorial

### National Grain Management

The idea of establishing a central government agency to manage the nation's grain supply, overseeing production, consumption, and adjusting surpluses and deficits, has been around for more than a decade. However, due to constant changes and discrepancies in the designation of positions, responsibilities, and powers, a formal system has never been established. With the invasion of foreign enemies and the displacement of the population, the demand for food has concentrated in areas with backward agriculture, and prices have soared due to the imbalance between supply and demand. As a result, the National Grain Administration was established, first at the central level and then in various provinces, with some success. Recently, a National Grain Conference was convened, which opened in Chongqing on the 20th of this month, marking a significant and crucial initiative. Food is a matter of great importance to the people and the foundation of governance. After thousands of years of laissez-faire policies, and during this protracted period of resistance and national reconstruction, the challenges and difficulties are unprecedented. How can we expect that establishing an administration and holding a conference will easily solve all the problems? Therefore, the nation should not have overly high expectations for this conference. The goal is for the conference to develop a sound plan, and for farmers, traders, distributors, and consumers to sincerely cooperate with the government, so that tangible results can be seen.

The government's main objective in managing grain is to ensure that the entire population has enough to eat. The necessary conditions for management are to avoid harming farmers and businesses while ensuring that grain prices are reasonable. If the focus is solely on the convenience of consumers and only on lowering grain prices, then both farmers and businesses will suffer. If the focus is solely on the interests of producers and traders, allowing them to manipulate and hoard, then the people's food supply will be severely affected. Since the situation is conflicting and contradictory, both sides must be taken into consideration, and the key is to address their opposition and promote their cooperation. We must ensure that farmers benefit from farming and enjoy farming, that traders benefit from trading and enjoy trading, and that consumers do not struggle to get enough to eat. The principle is simple: fairness and accuracy. Fairness means that the scale is balanced and there is no bias, and accuracy means that the line is straight and there is no deviation. However, it is easier said than done. Grain management, from production to transportation to storage, requires step-by-step management and comprehensive management. The complexity and difficulty are almost indescribable. However, this is only one aspect of management. The population is usually static, but in the extraordinary period of resistance and national reconstruction, it is rapidly changing. Grain follows the population, so those who manage it cannot simply close their doors and come up with solutions, nor can they expect that an unchanging method will be sufficient to adapt to change. The difficulty is unimaginable. However, this is only one aspect of management. If we can fully understand the abundance or scarcity of production, the distance and accessibility of transportation, the careful planning of storage, and the dynamic changes in the population in different regions, we must also separately review general living conditions and, based on the conditions of minimizing harm to farmers, businesses, and the people, formulate reasonable prices and carefully prevent all possible abuses related to distribution in the buying and selling system. This is another extremely important aspect of grain management. Therefore, it is said that it is easier said than done.

Let's not even talk about the ideal modern management system. The fundamental problem of China's current food supply is the lack of production. This is most clearly demonstrated by the fact that we must import rice every year. However, since the country has never had a management system in place, can we be sure that there is absolutely no hoarding of grain in various regions? Therefore, the total amount of imports each year may not necessarily be the difference between the nation's annual production and consumption. How much must be imported each year, and how must it be imported to reduce the damage to the national economy? This is one of the management's objectives. Throughout history, local governments, chambers of commerce, and other public organizations have often governed grain in their respective regions, acting impulsively, prioritizing small personal gains, and acting blindly. This is not what is meant by grain management. Because their perspective is limited to one area, they seem to believe that a shortage will immediately lead to widespread starvation and unanswered calls for help. This is understandable, but the fact that calls for help go unanswered is precisely because the nation's grain supply has not been managed. If there is no shortage, and they strive to have a surplus, believing that this is a sign of wealth and stability for the area, they block its outflow and suppress prices, claiming to be benefiting the people's livelihood, they do not realize that low grain prices harm farmers and are a major cause of rural bankruptcy, and they do not realize that withholding their surplus without using it to supplement the shortages in other areas is unethical and uneconomical. How can we eliminate this type of feudalistic behavior? How can we break down narrow-mindedness about regional self-interest? This is another management objective. Today's food situation is simply described as famine and high prices, which seems to make it impossible to talk about storage. However, in a broad sense, storage is not just about building granaries and preparing for famine. The reality of the grain market and the seasonal weighing of the crop are related to storage. Whenever there is a so-called grain problem, the market is chaotic, people are panicked, and profiteers take advantage of the situation to make huge profits. Then, there are measures such as selling grain at a flat price and setting price limits, which seem to be effective ways to provide relief and manage the situation. However, what is the actual effect? There are many doubts. Furthermore, there are those who use hypocrisy to cover up their great evils and those who manipulate the law to seek their own interests. Their crimes are unforgivable and their deceit is difficult to eliminate. However, if we ask the simple question: how much storage does the market actually have? The answer is often extremely difficult to obtain in the midst of panic. As a result, it is impossible for outsiders to know whether the panic is justified. How can this phenomenon be remedied? Thus, investigating storage is a prerequisite for storage and the initial step in management. This is yet another management objective. Grain management is a major national issue. Can this conference bring some order to this chaotic situation?

### Soviet-Japanese Economic Cooperation Agreement Reached in Principle, Reportedly Signed in Moscow

Singapore - According to a Saigon radio broadcast tonight, the Soviet Union and Japan have signed an economic cooperation agreement in principle in Moscow. (Reuters, 21st)

Tokyo - An article in the "Asahi Shimbun" stated that as trade talks between Japan and the Soviet Union are about to begin, attention should be paid to the political relationship of economic cooperation between the two countries. The resumption of trade negotiations is enough to show that the two countries are willing to maintain friendly relations. It is hoped that the success of the negotiations will contribute to the establishment of general peace and order in the Far East. The results of Japanese-Soviet cooperation can be relied upon by the geographical conditions of the Soviet Union, and will make the Axis powers more closely connected. The negotiation can be optimistic, for the following reasons: (1) The spread of the European War and the development of the overall situation in the Far East not only make the mutual suspicion between Japan and the Soviet Union in the Far East meaningless, but also create economic and political reasons to make economic cooperation between the two countries beneficial. (2) The war has caused the Soviet Union to turn to Japan, and then to other countries in East Asia, to obtain the supply of machinery, ships, rubber, and non-ferrous metals. (3) Japan is forced to abandon its reliance on the United Kingdom and the United States due to the unwarranted economic pressure imposed by the United Kingdom and the United States, and now needs the assistance of the Soviet Union.

They once entered areas such as Zifusi Laoyangjiachang. The Chinese army then lured the Japanese to the Zhaojiaqiao Dashanyuan area and launched a fierce attack on the morning of the 19th. The Japanese army then retreated towards Dongshi Pandouqiao, and Zifusi was recaptured by the Chinese army. At the same time, another unit of the Chinese army also captured Laoyangjiachang. There are currently no traces of the Japanese army south of Cenhekou. In this battle, more than 500 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the commander of the Japanese Hayasaka Cavalry Regiment was seriously injured. (4) On the morning of the 17th, the Japanese army attacking Zhaogao from Zhongchao County engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. By noon, the Japanese army had suffered heavy casualties and added more artillery pieces, gathering more than 1,000 mercenary soldiers to launch a fierce attack on the Chinese army. The Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army from multiple directions, and the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties from both sides. In this battle, the Chinese army killed more than 600 Japanese soldiers and captured two artillery pieces and more than 100 rifles. The Chinese army is currently intensifying its efforts to encircle and annihilate the remaining Japanese soldiers in the southwest area of Zhaogao. (5) On the morning of the 18th, more than 4,000 Japanese soldiers from northern Jiangsu split off from Sanlangmiao west of Xinghua and Hekou southwest of Xinghua to attack Xinghua, and used aircraft to provide cover for the operation. The Chinese army responded calmly and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army from multiple directions. By the morning of the 19th, the Chinese army had killed and wounded a large number of Japanese soldiers and sunk five Japanese motorboats. The Chinese army has now circled behind the Japanese army and is engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. (Telegram, 21st)

Luoyang - The Chinese army's attacks in southern Shanxi have yielded results in recent days. A unit of the Chinese army attacked along the Zhangmao Avenue on the night of the 13th, destroying multiple sections of the highway in the Dashan Village area and seizing more than a hundred kilograms of electric wire. (Telegram, 20th)

### Regarding Relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the Soviet Union Did Not Make Demands, Wang Chonghui Refutes Japanese Rumors

Chongqing - Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Chonghui today strongly denied Japanese reports that Moscow had requested the Chinese government to clarify its attitude towards the Chinese Communist Party. Foreign Minister Wang told a United Press reporter, "I can assure you that the Soviet government has never made demands or protests regarding the relationship between the Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party." Foreign Minister Wang added that the various claims made by the Japanese side are unfounded. He stated that the Soviet government believes that the relationship between the Chinese government and the Communist Party is purely a domestic matter. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Soviet Union's attitude on this point has been very clear. The claims made by the Japanese side are of course based on speculation about the dissolution of the New Fourth Army, but China has made detailed explanations to Moscow and other governments about this matter. When asked by reporters whether there was a phenomenon of reduced Soviet aid, Foreign Minister Wang replied that he believed that the various items transported to China via Turkestan were still being transported in sufficient quantities. As for the quantity of goods transported, only military authorities know the specifics. When discussing Japanese-Soviet negotiations, Foreign Minister Wang said that the Japanese side hopes to conclude a fisheries and commerce treaty with the Soviet Union, as well as a non-aggression treaty, but there has been little progress in the former two negotiations. In the near future, it seems unlikely that a non-aggression treaty will be concluded, as the Soviet Union clearly wants to maintain its current inherent advantages. (United Press, 21st)

### Report of Chinese Army Arriving at Thai-Burmese Border

Bangkok - Reports from northwestern Thailand say that 2,000 Chinese troops, with 21 tanks, have arrived at the Thai-Burmese border. It is said that the Chinese army is under the command of the Chongqing government to assist the British army in defending the Burmese highway along the border between the two countries.

### Decline of Commerce in Guangzhou, Activities of Chinese Guerrillas, Bombings Have Occurred Five Times, Japanese Aircraft Fly Overhead from Time to Time

Hong Kong - According to travelers from Guangzhou, house-to-house searches are conducted at any time, and pedestrians are checked at every street corner. Several guerrilla bases have been uncovered in the western suburbs of Guangzhou. Bombings have occurred five times, the last time near the Xinhua Theater in the city center, killing several Japanese soldiers. Since the repeated bombings, commerce in Guangzhou, including that run by the Japanese, has declined sharply. Searches were intensified on Chinese New Year's Eve, and more than 200 Chinese were arrested on suspicion of being terrorists. Military police sometimes search civilian homes between 1:00 AM and 3:00 AM to see if residents are all at home. Although commerce in Guangzhou is not developed, goods are still transported from Whampoa. The development plan for Whampoa has actually been completed. Large Japanese cargo ships sail to Whampoa to unload goods, which are then transferred to Guangzhou by rail. This railway was originally built by the Chinese, but has now been completed by the Japanese. Another route runs from Zhongshan to Shiqi, and then by highway to Macau. There are more than 100 Japanese aircraft in Guangzhou. On one occasion, 30 took off and circled over Guangzhou. (International Telegram, 21st)

### British Foreign Secretary and Chief of the General Staff Inspect the Middle East War Situation in Egypt. The Two Gentlemen Will Confer with Local Military Leaders. It is Rumored that Britain is Determined to Take Offensive Action in the Balkans.

Cairo - British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and British Imperial General Staff Chief General Dill arrived in Cairo yesterday. A spokesman for the British Embassy told a Reuters reporter that after the glorious victory of the British Army stationed in the Nile River, the time for a comprehensive review of the political and military situation in the Middle East and Africa has matured. The War Cabinet dispatched the Foreign Secretary and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff as its military advisor, which demonstrates the importance it attaches to this review. The two gentlemen will hold detailed discussions with Middle East military leaders and other authorities. It is very beneficial to the War Cabinet to have one of its members obtain direct intelligence regarding the Middle Eastern battlefield. Eden, who previously served as Secretary of War, once toured the Middle East and is familiar with the issues and figures in this part of the world. Therefore, it is only natural that the Cabinet chose Eden to undertake this mission. It is reported that Eden and General Dill left London a few days ago and flew to Egypt. This is Eden's third visit to Egypt since the start of the war. A year ago, when Eden was Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, he came to Egypt to welcome the first batch of Dominion troops. These troops participated in the Libyan campaign and achieved successive victories. Last November, when Eden was Secretary of War, he came to Egypt again to discuss everything with General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in the Middle East, and to inspect the war situation in North Africa and East Africa. Therefore, he is particularly familiar with the military and political issues concerning the Middle East, which is unmatched by any young politician. It is rumored that Eden may take some time to visit the Italian territories recently occupied by the British army. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

Rebellion in Abyssinia, Difficult for Italy to Cope

Khartoum - A Reuters special correspondent stationed on the Abyssinian-Eritrean border stated that the newly formed Abyssinian regular army, led by South African officers, will first participate in the attack on the Italian army's positions in Ganjela. Colonel Deliri, commander of the Italian army in the Gojjam region, once made a boast, saying that he would quell the rebellion of patriotic elements in Abyssinia and eradicate the British delegation remaining in Abyssinia. However, as a result, the chaos in the area has become unmanageable. Deliri has already been forced to retreat. When a large detachment of Abyssinian regular army, patriotic elements disguised as civilians, and Sudanese border guards began to attack, half of the Italian garrison had already withdrawn. Before the land attack began, the British Air Force bombed the Italian army barracks, destroying barbed wire and other defenses, so that the Abyssinian army could quickly reach its destination. Before the regular army entered the battlefield, the Abyssinian King held a ceremonial review. Junior officers and soldiers all swore allegiance, and the Abyssinian King presented flags. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

New York - For the past few days, national newspapers have placed the Balkan situation in a prominent position, but now it has been replaced by the situation in Japan and the Far East. However, the opinions of various newspapers and wireless transmissions have not yet shown any signs of attaching great importance to the Japanese threat. It seems that they all regard it as a kind of psychological warfare. If Japan really has this intention, then as far as the United States is concerned, it can be said to have failed, because the firmness of the United States and Britain in dealing with the situation has made general commentators somewhat optimistic about the current situation, and they believe that Japan will soften its stance. However, it is also acknowledged that the development may lead to a critical situation. The newspapers have expressed a more hopeful attitude towards the Balkan situation, believing that the arrival of British Secretary of War Eden and British Imperial General Staff Chief General Dill in Cairo is clear evidence of Britain's determination to take offensive military action in the Balkans. It is now believed that Greece will continue to resist, and British aid will not be interrupted. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

Istanbul - Yesterday, the Greek diplomatic office here strongly denied any peace negotiations with Italy. They said, "No matter what, we cannot abandon Britain." However, it is rumored that the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, is still constantly requesting the Turkish government to mediate the Greek-Italian war. According to sources from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bulgaria will abandon the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression declaration in order to allow Germany to use Bulgaria as a base for invading Greece. Also, according to British sources, if [Germany] attacks Greece, Turkey will immediately declare war on Germany, but will take a defensive stance strategically, which is most suitable for Turkey and can allow British warships to pass through the Dardanelles Strait to attack Romanian transport lines. At the same time, the British army can also use Turkey as a base of operations. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

### British Planes Reconnoiter Romanian Oil Fields

Budapest - According to news received here today, British warplanes conducted reconnaissance flights over the Romanian Ploiesti oil fields, which are under German protection, yesterday. At the same time, it is claimed that Bulgaria has mobilized some reserve forces and has taken precautionary measures. According to diplomatic circles in the capital of South [Yugoslavia], the final demands made by Germany to Greece regarding the Italian-Greek armistice will be presented in the next two days. The Turkish Vakit newspaper claimed this morning that although the Turkish-Bulgarian agreement has been signed, Turkey will not be able to maintain neutrality if foreign troops enter Bulgaria. Therefore, the Balkan situation is tense again today. Furthermore, according to diplomatic sources, if Greece does not accept Germany's mediation proposal, the date for German troops to advance to Thessaloniki, Greece, has been set for next Tuesday. (International News Agency dispatch, 21st)

### German Troops Enter Western Border. Germany Proposed Cooperation with Spain to Cope with the Current Emergency.

Madrid - German troops entered Spain today. Prior to this, Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer accepted the proposal made by the German Ambassador to cooperate with the Spanish government in dealing with the tense situation. The German troops entering the Spanish border are five teams of technical and ambulance units from the German occupation forces in France. These German troops will assist in the construction of Santander, which was recently damaged by a fire caused by wind and rain. The fire occurred when a broken power line touched an oil pool, destroying one-third of the city and leaving 65,000 people homeless. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

Vichy - US Embassy Counselor Murphy flew to Tangier today to inspect the international zone there. Since last November, Spanish Prime Minister Franco has hoped to bring the area completely under Spanish control and abolish the international condominium. The United States is also one of the signatories to the international condominium in the area and has not recognized Franco's occupation of the area. Britain has also protested Franco's occupation of the area. The matter was also discussed during the recent Franco-Spanish talks. It is said that Britain is currently conducting negotiations with the Spanish government to establish an agreement to protect British industries and investments in the area. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

### Greece Needs Airplanes, Asks the United States for Aid. Italian Army in Abyssinia Suffers Heavy Losses.

New York - According to news from Washington, Greece has continued to ask the United States for aid, emphasizing that airplanes are even more needed. As a result, officials have begun to check the items that can be supplied at present. According to people here, Greece has a good chance of persuading the British and American armies and navies to waive their priority rights for some military aircraft that are nearing completion. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

London - The Athens radio station announced that the Italian army in Albania launched three counterattacks yesterday, all of which were defeated by the Greek army without much effort, and the enemy army suffered heavy losses. The Italian army's left wing suffered heavy casualties. The bad weather in recent days has prevented Greek aircraft from operating effectively in the skies over the highlands occupied by the Italian army. Greek aircraft shot down five enemy aircraft in aerial combat. According to the latest Greek military bulletin, the Greek army captured a strong enemy position yesterday, captured 200 enemies, and seized a lot of automatic weapons and war materials. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### Bulgarian Situation Remains Tense After the Signing of the Turkish-Bulgarian Pact. It is Rumored that Germany is Building a Pontoon Bridge on the Danube River. Part of the Bulgarian Army has been Mobilized.

Sofia - The tension here continues to increase today. Well-informed sources insist that German troops have built a pontoon bridge on the Danube River, and there is also clear evidence that part of the Bulgarian army has been mobilized. Although the government has formally denied that a pontoon bridge has been built on the Danube River near Raschuk on the Bulgarian border, news of the construction of this pontoon bridge continues to arrive here. A government spokesperson also admitted that there were such rumors but said that they were not true. A certain bulletin openly declared, "It is a public fact that reservists have been called into the army to defend the country." Another rumor is that Bulgaria, the Soviet Union, and Germany are currently negotiating a mutual assistance pact, but this news cannot be verified in any way. Some believe that the Soviet Union will protect Bulgaria, but others openly admit that there is no way to prevent German troops from passing through Bulgaria. The general Bulgarian public has expressed unease due to the mobilization movement, the receipt of bread shops, and rumors of Germany building a pontoon bridge on the Danube River. (Associated Press dispatch, 20th)

Sofia - Yesterday, the government officially denied that there was a pontoon bridge built between Romania and Bulgaria on the Danube River, but a government spokesman believed that such rumors of bridging were also a normal phenomenon, but this matter was not true. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

Zurich - Yesterday, according to reliable sources here, Germany is building a pontoon bridge on the Danube River between Romania and Bulgaria. German engineers are currently working on the Bulgarian border. A week ago, a pontoon bridge 50 miles long was built on the Danube River between Romania and Bulgaria, and a large number of troops passed through, but it was dismantled when the troops returned to Romania.

### British-Turkish Relations Remain Unchanged. Comments from Turkish Newspapers.

London - Ankara Radio announced yesterday that the Turkish newspaper Akşam commented on the Turkish-Bulgarian declaration, saying that Turkey takes the British-Turkish alliance as its eternal national policy. If outsiders think that Turkey can take actions contrary to its alliance with Britain, they are greatly mistaken. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

Istanbul - The Turkish newspaper Vakit refuted the Bulgarian government's claim that according to the agreement with Turkey, it can allow German troops to pass through, saying, "Now someone thinks that the signing of the Turkish-Bulgarian declaration means that Bulgaria has obtained Turkey's neutrality and can allow German troops to pass through. Turkey can resolutely tell them no. Bulgaria's signing of this declaration has given unreserved recognition to the friendship and alliance between Britain and Turkey and between Turkey and Greece. The evidence is there and cannot be disputed." Turkish Congressman Yarçin revealed in an article in the Yeni Sabah newspaper that the British-Turkish alliance is unchangeable. The psychological warfare waged by the Axis powers in the Balkans will eventually collapse before the fortress of Turkish strength. The constant contact between Britain and Turkey during the difficult period has created a deep-rooted friendship and mutual respect and trust between the two countries. The Turkish people today are still acting in the same way as Britain in the past, and are always close friends and allies with the same interests who share joys and sorrows. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### Germany Will Launch a Submarine Offensive

Berlin - Last night, the highest authorities of the German government revealed to reporters that the plan for a large-scale submarine offensive against Britain in the spring is to force Britain to either "surrender or perish." It is said that dozens of German submarines will search around the British Isles, seize and sink any ships they see. Their only goal is the surrender of Britain. The British will not be able to continue fighting, because the merchant fleet, which is the lifeline of the British Empire, has been greatly damaged by the continuous and fierce attacks of submarines. It is pointed out that the last war was almost won by German submarines. This fact has not only been recognized by neutral historians but also by British historians. Today, the Third Reich's submarine warfare is far more perfect than what was dreamed of in 1917. Although the German goals in the spring have been clearly stated, people still expect other surprising actions to occur on the battlefield. This is because the Führer Hitler will, as in the past, deliberately conceal his every action. What the German government has revealed may be just another military operation. Observers here say that the only thing that can be determined is that a powerful German submarine fleet will soon surround Britain. It is revealed that these new submarines can travel 60 miles per hour and launch torpedoes very quickly and accurately. (International News Agency dispatch, 21st)

### The Status of Governments Moving to Britain Increases. The British House of Commons Passes a Bill to Grant Them Diplomatic Status.

London - The Diplomatic Privileges Bill passed its second reading in the House of Commons on Thursday and will soon be submitted for its third and final reading. When Undersecretary of State Butler moved the second reading of the bill, he said that London has become a small Europe, so he hopes to adjust British laws to adapt to the international nature of London. The bill proposes that members of the governments of Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and Belgium, the provisional government of Czechoslovakia, and leaders and key members of the Free French movement all receive the same status as diplomats. The British government will agree with other governments on a list of the names of the people concerned, which will be published in the London Gazette. The protection given by the British government to diplomatic envoys stationed in Britain should apply to the diplomatic representatives of the Allied governments stationed in Britain. London is the center of Free Europe's resistance. The above-mentioned bill will make Britain a truly free home for representatives of countries determined to resist. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

The livestock in various collective farms has also increased as follows: large horned livestock increased by 12 percent, pigs increased by 15 percent, sheep increased by 25 percent, and goats increased by 34 percent. The material and cultural standards of the Soviet people have improved. The total wage amount in 1937 was only 82,200,000,000 rubles, which increased to 116,500,000,000 rubles in 1939, and further increased to 123,700,000,000 rubles in 1904. The income of collective farms and individual collective farmers has increased. Investments used to establish new enterprises reached nearly 38,000,000,000 rubles in 1940, and 108,000,000,000 rubles in the three years of the Third Five-Year Plan. In the past three years, thousands of new factories and power plants have been established one after another, with coal production increasing by 51,000,000 tons, power plant capacity increasing by 2,400,000 kilowatts, and blast furnace production of pig iron increasing by 2.9 million tons. The textile industry has increased its spindles by 1 million.

### Australian Prime Minister Arrives in Britain to Confer on the Far East Situation. Australia Has a Special Responsibility to Help Britain Defend Singapore.

London - The Australian Prime Minister arrived here by plane from Lisbon yesterday. He will confer with Prime Minister Churchill and other senior officials on the Far East situation. Because Australian troops have now landed in Singapore to defend it, this trip by Menzies is considered extremely important by all parties. Menzies will discuss all parts of the British military plan. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)

London - Australian Prime Minister Menzies arrived here today to discuss matters with the British government. He told visiting reporters, "We have accepted a special responsibility for the defense of Singapore. We do not adopt any aggressive policies, but will implement self-defense. Australia has never forgotten all the good neighborly acts of our allied countries during the last great war. However, Japan is no longer our ally and has joined the alliance of the Axis powers and has certain obligations to our enemies." Australia has a clear purpose for the Pacific, which is to maintain peace. This purpose is suitable for Australia, and it is believed to be suitable for the interests of every other Pacific country. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

London - Australian Prime Minister Menzies, who was invited by the British government to come to Britain to discuss all matters concerning the war situation, flew to Britain yesterday afternoon. According to Menzies, he was very pleased to come to Britain and could tell the British people on behalf of the Australian people that Australians are now fighting shoulder to shoulder with the British people. As long as there are Australians on the ground, they will never let Britain fail. Menzies mentioned his tour of the Middle East and said that he flew 3,500 miles in the Middle East, from Jerusalem to Benghazi. This distance also shows how rapid the Australian army's actions are. He saw that the morale of the Australian army was high. They regarded the war against Italy as a slow preliminary action. What they hoped for was to fight against the German army. Menzies also praised the British people for enduring the bombing and said that he brought with him from Australia the belief that victory is certain, and the definite guarantee that as long as Australia has a shred of strength, it will never let Britain fight alone. He hoped to personally witness the current situation in Britain, so that when he returned to Australia, he could give Australians a clear impression of the real situation in Britain. He is convinced that the clearer Australians understand the truth, the greater Australia's war efforts will be. Britain will undoubtedly win, but it cannot achieve complete victory without exerting its greatest efforts. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### Matsuoka Suddenly Denies Suggesting Mediation of the European War; Letter to Eden Only Expressed Personal Views; British Undersecretary Meets with Soviet Ambassador

Tokyo - Yesterday evening, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka denied the reports from London that he had suggested mediation to British Foreign Secretary Eden. It is said that his telegram to Eden was in response to an inquiry regarding the mediation of the Thai-Indochina dispute, but the telegram expressed his views on establishing world peace. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

Tokyo - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told foreign visitors today that reports of Foreign Minister Matsuoka making mediation suggestions to a certain country were untrue. Matsuoka's communication to British Foreign Secretary Eden expressed his personal views on the Far Eastern crisis and the construction of a new world order. Matsuoka's communication was delivered to Eden by the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, because Eden had previously expressed his views on Japan's mediation of the Thai-Indochina dispute and the overall situation in the Far East to the Japanese ambassador. Therefore, he took the opportunity to state his personal views to Eden. Matsuoka's communication should not be regarded as an offer of mediation. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

Tokyo - This morning, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii, while receiving news reporters, responded to a question about a Washington report stating that the British Admiralty had warned Japan that if Singapore were attacked, the United States would retaliate. He said that the British Navy would not and should not make such a warning. When asked about statements by U.S. congressmen that if Japan attacked Singapore, the United States would attack Japan, Ishii retorted, "Who can predict that Japan will attack Singapore?" He also said that his sincere statement on February 10th that rumors of tension in the East Asian situation were unfounded had had some effect, and the reaction it caused was greater than he initially expected. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

London - Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky met with Foreign Office official Butler at the Foreign Office yesterday to discuss Japanese actions and the letter from Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka to Foreign Secretary Eden. Well-informed British sources said that Matsuoka's letter mentioned that Japan would mediate in any war in the world, but the location of the war was vaguely worded. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

Practicing Cunning Tricks; Japan's Plans Will Ultimately Fail

Bombay - Indian newspapers believe that Japan's mediation efforts are merely a diplomatic move to divert attention from Japan's contradictory behavior. The "Bombay Sentinel" stated that Britain does not need Japan's mediation, and Britain is stepping up preparations in the Far East, while Japan's attitude is becoming more friendly. "Sind Observer" stated that a country that has been at war with China for a decade is now suggesting it is willing to work for peace, which is hypocritical. It is difficult for the world to believe that Japan's move stems from genuine hopes for peace, because if Japan has such sincerity, it must set a precedent and end its aggressive actions against China. "Free Press Journal" stated that while Hitler is currently conducting a war of nerves against the enemy, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is conducting a war of cleverness. The former's actions are ferocious and terrifying, while the latter's actions are cunning and treacherous. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

Motives for Japan's Actions: Observations from Chongqing

Chongqing - Until now, the general public has not paid much attention to the Japanese proposal to mediate the European war. It was not until the British revealed it in the House of Commons that people were surprised. Observers commented on the motives behind this unexpected move by Japan, believing that there must be several reasons: first, Germany's repeated proposals for peace have failed, so this decision was changed to have Japan come forward; if it succeeds, the Sino-Japanese war may also be resolved at the same time; second, the U.S. Senate is currently discussing the Lend-Lease Act, and Japan wants to influence it with this move; third, knowing that this kind of mediation is difficult to accept, but before Germany launches an offensive against mainland Britain and Japan echoes it in the Far East, they want to place the responsibility for the war on Britain and the United States. In short, Japan has already concluded an alliance with the Axis powers, and it seems that it had consulted the opinions of these countries before suggesting mediation. However, it still made this suggestion at this time, not caring about temporary failure, which is something that most people cannot understand. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

Rome Expresses: Determined to Fight to the End

Swiss Capital - Regarding the Japanese proposal to mediate the current European war, the Roman newspapers all refused to express any opinions. Italian political figures want to wait until Japan publishes the content of the mediation before expressing their opinions, saying only that the meaning of Japan's move is not as great as the foreign newspapers have reported. They speculate that its intention is to counter the strategy of Britain and the Australian Federation jointly spreading alarming news in the Pacific region, prompting the United States to take a stronger attitude towards Japan, because Japan can take the opportunity to propose mediating the current European war to reiterate its desire for peace. However, as far as Italy is concerned, it has firmly decided not to lay down its arms until the Axis powers achieve complete victory. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### A Batch of American Bombers Shipped to China

New York - The New York Herald Tribune reported that 70 American-made bombers have set sail for the Far East and are said to be handed over to the Chongqing government's air force personnel. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 21st)

### Chongqing Circles Focus on the Development of the Situation

Chongqing - After Britain and the United States adopted a tough stance in the Pacific, what actions Japan will take to deal with it is still being closely watched by all circles in China. Some say that Japan must wait until Germany's blitzkrieg in Europe resumes before deciding whether to launch an attack in the Pacific. Others say that if Japan's southward advance is blocked, it will turn its attention to China. Chinese circles believe that if Japan launches a war in the South Pacific, its main force will attack Singapore by land, and its navy will attack the Dutch East Indies. However, the Japanese army and navy concentrated in the South China Sea are not yet sufficient to launch an immediate attack. It is rumored that Japanese troops have been arriving in Hankou for days, but the number of newly arrived Japanese troops is not large, and it is not known whether they are reinforcements or replacements. Well-informed Chinese sources say that Germany is currently trying to reach a compromise between the Soviet Union and Japan, so it is urging Japan to return South Sakhalin Island to the Soviet Union as a reward for concluding a non-aggression pact. It is heard that Moscow is now advocating that Japan should withdraw its fleet stationed in the North Pacific to eliminate the threat to Vladivostok. There are currently 200,000 Japanese troops stationed in "Manchukuo," while there are as many as 600,000 Soviet troops on the border of "Manchukuo." (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

### Seventh Anniversary of the New Life Movement: Chairman Chiang's Broadcast Speech

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) The third is to promote thrift and savings. Thrift is the prerequisite for integrity and should be implemented in clothing, food, housing, transportation, and all aspects of daily life. At this time of war, how can everyone forget the bloody battles of the soldiers at the front and not know how to strengthen hardship? The closer we get to victory, the more arduous the resistance and construction work will inevitably be, and the sources of military supplies and people's livelihood will inevitably be more difficult. For public and private reasons, we should not only be thrifty but also strive to save. We must eradicate old habits, maintain our lives, relieve our compatriots, and revive our country, so we must be thrifty. It must be known that thrift can make the most of things and make the family not poor.

Only when the country has surplus wealth can it meet the moral standards of wartime. The meaning of savings should also be extended. Not only should we save money, but we should also cherish things. In modern civilized countries, children's education mostly regards collecting waste as a patriotic virtue and using waste as a common sense of patriotism. Whether it is scrap copper, rotten iron, accumulated and used well, it can improve machinery. Even rags, scraps of paper, every grass, and every tree are all useful raw materials. We must not only cherish public property but also encourage our compatriots to collect waste and guide our compatriots to use waste. This is a broader sense of thrift and savings. It must be known that only by vigorously implementing thrift and savings can we cultivate a simple style. In this way, we can directly

Cure the roots of our nation's diseases of "extravagance" and "greed," and indirectly eliminate the bad customs of "theft" and "prostitution," and create a style of integrity and shame. Fourth is to promote health and sports. In general, people see the decline of our country in the past 100 years and the aggression of the Japanese against our country in the past 40 years, and they believe that we Chinese are a weak nation, believing that weakness is an inherent disease of our nation. I will never admit that our Chinese nation is a weak nation, but what I worry and shame about is only the weakness of the physique of our individual citizens. Generally speaking, it is only weak in physique, but in spirit, everyone sees many examples in our country's history of men dying for righteousness and women sacrificing themselves for the country. Even in this war, there are even more facts of generosity and martyrdom. For example, the recent martyrdom of Jin Huating, the editor of the Shanghai Shen Bao, is a heroic fact. For more than three years, our compatriots from all over the country, regardless of

Men, women, old and young, only rely on our patriotic enthusiasm and flesh and blood, can not avoid hardships and dangers, in the bombing, burning, shelling, bayonets, fire, and blood everywhere, year after year, day and night, continuous, very tragic life, swear to the death to resist and fight, but also can calmly and firmly as usual work. This kind of knife-saw punishment that is as sweet as sugar, moving the heavens and weeping ghosts, is enough to prove that our Chinese nation, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, has the most loyal, most tenacious kind of national character in the world. Where is it weak? Where is it cowardly? If the physique of our compatriots across the country can be stronger and more solid, then our nation will inevitably exert its more intense and courageous spirit. It goes without saying that it is a pity that today's general public has those who are sick without working and those who are still young and prematurely old. The "disease" and "weakness" of each citizen is indeed the most regrettable shame of our nation. Tracing its reasons, mostly due to

Not knowing hygiene and not valuing sports, the New Life Movement originally took hygiene as an important principle in all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The popularization of national sports has been one of the important tasks over the years. In the future, not only should schools at all levels pay special attention to sports, but also all agencies, shops, factories, and rural areas, regardless of old or young, male or female, from private to public places, should popularize the habit of hygiene and cleanliness. Moreover, every compatriot should know that he must have a suitable fitness exercise to improve his personal physique and promote the health of the nation. Only in this way can we wash away the shame of the titles of "Sick Man of East Asia" and "Old China," and create a prosperous, strong, and happy modern country. Moreover, only by improving the national physique can we cure the roots of our nation's diseases of "laziness" and "cowardice," cultivate our spirit of cleanliness, speed, and accuracy, and establish a style of etiquette, justice, and shame in the country and society.

### International Anecdotes (6): Impressions of the Four Giants of Europe and America

Dorothy Thompson, a renowned American writer, has been stationed in Europe for many years, serving as a correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune. Due to the nature of her work, she frequently interacts with prominent figures in various countries' governments and societies. With her keen observations, she produces light and fluent reportage literature. Her writings are widely circulated and admired, making her an outstanding figure among female journalists. This article is a silhouette of the four giants of the current European and American stage—Churchill, Hitler, Stalin, and Roosevelt—penned by Ms. Thompson. It is insightful and poignant, and I have translated it as follows:

The most important figures in the world are Roosevelt, Churchill, Hitler, and Stalin. What kind of people are they really? My knowledge of them, in the case of three, comes from my personal experience. I have never met Stalin. But I have met and talked with Roosevelt, Churchill, and Hitler. Perhaps the impressions I have gained can add something to the existing writings about them. Moreover, I have a very well-informed friend who has had close interactions with Stalin, so perhaps I can also contribute something to understanding the misunderstood personality of Stalin.

Churchill is a man of brightness and warmth, most aligned with the Doctrine of the Mean. Although he comes from Irish and American blood (Churchill's mother was American), he is thoroughly English. In every aspect, Churchill and Hitler are at opposite ends. Hitler came from humble beginnings; Churchill, on the other hand, is an "aristocrat of the royal family" of England. Hitler had a very difficult youth. Churchill, on the other hand, lived a life of luxury and ease from a young age.

Churchill is a bohemian aristocrat. Because of his extraordinary talent, unconventionality, and freedom from class consciousness. He is unmoved by fame and fortune; what he always keeps in mind is civilization. What distinguishes him from ordinary aristocrats is that he has no timidity towards the general public. If things get to a desperate point, he would rather see England become communist than be enslaved.

Churchill is a man under the Sagittarius constellation. Benevolent, chivalrous, and wholeheartedly devoted to his country, he can be said to be unprecedented. He took on a heavy responsibility during the most dangerous stage in British history, knowing it was impossible to succeed but doing it anyway, and he is still striving to do so. I don't believe that for a minute did he ever think that England would be defeated. If he had thought so, then England would have been utterly defeated after the collapse of France last June. But he never shirked his responsibilities. He trusts in the infinite human resources of England; he trusts in the English character, which cannot be measured by ordinary logic; he trusts in England, to which he entrusts his utter sincerity. Churchill possesses a spirit that transcends time, like his uniquely styled prose and speeches, which resemble ancient texts from hundreds of years ago. No one is as good as Churchill at evoking the great spirit of his ancestors—Shakespeare, Shelley, Nelson, Drake—to inspire popular morale and patriotic fervor.

Hitler, on the other hand, has a great appeal to the general public, which is his special talent. Where this power to influence others comes from is extremely difficult to understand. This power is like hypnosis, or more appropriately, it can be called magic. He has the power to drive the masses, allowing a vast multitude to follow him as if possessed. For example, many German women believe he is a handsome man.

I met with Hitler for half an hour. During these thirty minutes, I carefully examined him, hoping to gain a deep and unforgettable impression. He is five feet ten inches tall, but because his body is not very well proportioned, he always looks shorter. His upper body is longer than his lower body. His chest is slightly collapsed, and his shoulders are slightly rounded. He has a bad posture when standing, with a protruding abdomen and slightly bent legs, so his toes also point outward slightly. His hands are quite vulgar and often tremble slightly.

Hitler's skin is very thin, slightly yellowish, and his face, from his jaw to his cheeks, does not look very symmetrical. His forehead is narrow and recedes backward. His hair grows very well, fine and soft, and dark brown. His beard is also like this. This is what is called "hair-colored hair." If, as recently reported, Hitler's hair is now reddish-brown, then it must have been bleached after I saw him. His mouth is the ugliest part of his appearance. His lips are almost invisible, and his teeth tilt slightly inward.

Hitler's eyes are the most moving. At first sight, they are unforgettable. His eyes are not light blue, as those who worship him say, but rather blue-gray. During the half hour I met with Hitler, I sat opposite him at a long, narrow table. I never stared into his eyes. His eyes were always looking far away. It is very difficult to talk to someone whose eyes are not looking at you. Hitler's eyes, however, possess this quality: even though his eyes are not looking at you, you are forced to look at him. After his spirit is aroused, he speaks as if possessed by a ghost. When he speaks, it is as if there is no audience in front of him. His target seems to be an imaginary audience—or perhaps himself. He is simply entranced by hearing himself speak. When he speaks, his entire face changes abruptly; waves of color will change. In the midst of ordinary changes, he exhibits a confusing and obsequious feeling. He is not worshipped by himself, but simply worshipped.

Hitler's influence on all sorts of people is quite worth recording. I know that several highly talented and insightful people will "follow him." Some people feel uneasy when they see him, and some people detest him. I myself feel uncomfortable about him. I seem to have seen an exhibition of secrets that are not suitable for public display. But his influence on the masses is undeniably miraculous.

I have heard him speak several times, and the result is always a feeling of coldness and aversion, as if I have seen something not very wonderful. And those scenes are indeed not very clever. When he speaks to the masses, he always produces a kind of magic possessed by feline animals. He is not good at rhetoric. Hitler is definitely no match for Goering in cold and sarcastic, confusing language. As far as lecturing is concerned, Weissford can certainly be a teacher without shame. Hitler's speeches are both scattered and circuitous. The words he uses are often unclear in meaning, disregarding grammar, and mixed with the vulgar language of northern Austria. I have to admit that if it weren't for listening to his words to hear what he meant to say, I would really feel annoyed. As for himself, he does not want to be annoying, because the trance-like conversations of a medium are not annoying.

In the crowd, Hitler becomes a temperamental, fanciful, and most painful person, like a shadow among them, creating an exaggerated, terrible, tense, and ghostly atmosphere. People are afraid of him and terrified of the masses he controls. Hitler is cruel, but he does not lose his love for animals and young children because of this. He is vindictive, like a woman. He never forgives or forgets hatred. Even a tiny gap, after a few years, he will still retaliate—the purge in 1934 is one example. I suspect that Hitler has never had a normal relationship with anyone.

I do not believe that Hitler will tend to peace. The reason for this has nothing to do with logic. Apart from war, he does not use logic at all. He is obsessed, relying on his illusory, cunning means, venting his anger and fearing that the world will not be in chaos. He is simply beyond reason. I firmly believe that if he ever started to reason, he would lose his "genius."

### Grain Prices: Rumors of Subsidized Rice Prices Return, Speculation in Rice Weevils Grows Daily, Anticipating Successive Shipments of Rice

Recently, the market price of foreign rice has repeatedly soared, reaching its limit. Yesterday, a telegram from Hong Kong further reported a significant increase, coupled with rumors of a shortage of tonnage. As a result, rice weevil hoarders have become increasingly ambitious, with hardly any goods being displayed, and the overall situation is nearing a state of deliberate withholding. However, buyers are in a particularly difficult situation, feeling that there are no goods to purchase. Apart from some recycled goods slightly easing the emergency, only the Zhongguan No. 1 Siamese rice is relatively abundant in the market and is slightly available for sale, but the price is high and is approaching the limit. As for the small refined and No. 2 Saigon rice in the middle segment, they are almost non-existent. According to market estimates, recycled No. 1 Saigon rice is priced at 85 yuan, No. 2 at 80 yuan, Zhongguan No. 1 Siamese rice at 84.5 yuan to 84 yuan, especially with no market. Fire-refined medium at 84 yuan, old at 82.5 yuan, Mindang at 86 yuan, Zhongguan Burmese rice at 84 yuan, small refined at 76 yuan, medium rice Lu at 73 yuan to 72 yuan, broken tips at 67 yuan, No. 3 broken at 65 yuan. Depending on the type of goods, a hidden increase of over one yuan is added. If the hoarding rice merchants manipulate the situation, the previous situation of lacking goods to meet the market demand will definitely be repeated. Rumors of subsidized prices outside the market are still rampant. The Nanyang issue is indeed the only propaganda tool for these people. Although the orders are being processed, they claim that there are insufficient ships and dangerous shipping, leading to a resurgence of active hoarding. Futures prices have been raised by several jiao to one yuan. The prices are as follows: No. 1 Saigon rice for February delivery at 97.7 yuan, en route goods at 100 yuan, No. 2 spot at 94 yuan, small refined spot at 91.35 yuan to 92 yuan, 16-piece packaging at 91 yuan, February-March delivery at 89 yuan, February delivery at 89.5 yuan to 88.5 yuan, and Haiphong rice spot at 91.5 yuan. Over 1,000 tons were traded, and there are also 14,000 bags of spot rice. However, in new transactions, He Yi has already released 2,000 tons of small refined rice for February-March delivery, with the price still at 88 yuan. In addition, negotiations are still in progress via telegram.

Foreign rice shipments have been arriving continuously in recent days. The production prices of new transactions are low. Chinese and foreign merchants are still actively selling. In addition to Japanese merchants selling in the market, they are also directly arranging shipments to Shanghai. The Japanese merchant Yamashita's ship has already unloaded over 70,000 bags, and it is rumored that one or two more entire batches will arrive soon. Yesterday, the EldsrAdo ship, managed by the Baolong Foreign Firm, arrived from Saigon with 2,400 tons, totaling over 24,000 bags, and docked at the Pudong Longmao warehouse pier for unloading. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan ship arrived in Shanghai the night before last, carrying 738 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's pier in the French Concession. (Zu)

Due to the continuous soaring prices of foreign rice, the owners of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice have strengthened their resolve and are also trying to raise prices. However, the sales market is not as broad as that of foreign rice, making it difficult to achieve their wishes. Therefore, although the prices of various types have also improved, they have only increased by about half a yuan. The prices are as follows: Kunshan original japonica at 108 yuan, bulk at 104 yuan, second-grade at 101-2 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice bulk at 100 yuan, 99.5 yuan, second-grade at 99 yuan, original package at 106 yuan.

Large households continue to absorb glutinous rice, and the situation is also tight. However, it is not easy to fully raise the selling price, and it is still only slightly raised by half a yuan. The prices are as follows: Hong Kong special grade at 84 yuan, ordinary at 82-3 yuan, glutinous rice Lu at 76 yuan.

### Foreign Vermicelli Orders Arriving Continuously - Spot Vermicelli Held Back, Prices Continue to Rise

The foreign vermicelli market still looks promising. In terms of supply, entire batches of orders are arriving continuously. However, the rumor that British ships will suspend operations in the Pacific and the news that ships carrying vermicelli from Australia have been blocked in Hong Kong have made people optimistic. As a result, spot vermicelli in the market is being held back, and the supply is insufficient. It is difficult to predict when goods en route will arrive, so importers are not greedy. Clock Tower brand Australian vermicelli and Golden Dragon brand Kan vermicelli are being actively sought after by retailers and hoarders, so market prices are increasing. Clock Tower brand is priced at 25.85 yuan, Golden Dragon brand at 24.6 yuan, and Beautiful brand has jumped to over 26 yuan, all rising by 2-3 jiao compared to the previous day. Futures prices are quoted at 25 yuan, but there are no formal transactions.

The wheat market remains firm and quiet. The supply from both domestic and foreign sources is scarce. The stock of wheat in Shanghai is dwindling day by day. Although the market price has reached 40 yuan, no entire batches of spot goods have been sold. The price limits set by Japanese factories are still not relaxed. The price of high-grade Du wheat is 33 yuan, and lower-grade goods still require additional payments, so there are also no goods to be collected at the retail level. The market remains in a state of being withheld.

### Oil Cakes: Under Organized Monopoly, Soybean Cakes Inevitably Rise

Yesterday, the soybean cake market did not lose its luster due to the mediocrity of soybeans. It rose and fell consecutively, but the results were still able to support it, which aroused the desire of the bullish companies. The market is under an organized monopoly, rising rapidly, and soaring by 4 jiao compared to the previous day. The transaction for Yuanlong cakes for February delivery was 5 cars, priced at 14.5 yuan to 6 jiao, and 2 cars for March delivery, priced at 14.75 yuan. The transaction for Shengji cakes for February delivery was 4,000 pieces, priced at 14.5 yuan to 6 jiao, 5,000 pieces for March upper delivery, priced at 14.75 yuan to 15 yuan, over 10,000 pieces for March lower delivery, priced at 14.85 yuan to 15.12 yuan, and over 40,000 pieces for April upper delivery, priced at 14.85 yuan to 15.22 yuan.

On the 22nd, miscellaneous grains were exported, including 1,500 bags of corn and 300 bags of peanuts, all transported to Hong Kong. 250 bags of beans were transported to Singapore, and over 2,240 pieces of soybean cakes were transported to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Fluctuates

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC exchange rate. The trend in the black market for British and American exchange rates was wavering. There were no significant developments in the international situation, and people's minds were calm. Speculators were both entering and exiting the market today, so the market softened and then relaxed. Although there were rumors that the Japanese were increasing troops on Hainan Island in preparation for further advances, the price remained tight. The US exchange rate was 5.65625 yuan, and it was difficult to settle at noon. The market was flat afterward, and buyers were lacking. At the close of the evening, the spot US exchange rate was 5.65625 yuan, and the British exchange rate was 3 shillings 4.453125 pence, decreasing by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively compared to the previous day.

The exchange rates for British against US and Shanghai were flat, the US against British was unchanged, and the US against Shanghai was also flat. The central exchange rates were the same as before. The banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3 shillings 4.46875 pence for British gold and 5.6875 yuan for the US exchange rate, the same as the closing prices of the previous evening. After opening, speculators first stuffed US exchange rates for March delivery, with the Bank of England having favorable intentions to buy. The market showed no changes in the balance of supply and demand. Speculators offered favorable US exchange rates for March delivery at 5.65625 yuan. The announcement of the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged, and there were no changes in the silver balance tax. Afterwards, due to a shift in people's confidence, speculators suddenly had the intention to accept and entered the same month's US exchange rate at 5.625 yuan from a certain US bank and foreign banks. By noon, with relatively strong demand, the market was promising. The spot US exchange rate closed at 5.65625 yuan, and it was difficult to settle, retreating to 5.625 yuan. The US exchange rate was 3 shillings 14.453125 pence.

Buyers Decreased Again in the Afternoon Market

The situation in the afternoon market was slightly firm. Speculators stopped scalping and some shillings were stuffed out. China Bank absorbed this month's price at 3 shillings 4.453125 pence, while a foreign bank did this month's US exchange rate at 5.65625 yuan. The evening closing price for spot and this month's US exchange rate was 5.65625 yuan, shillings at 3 shillings 4.453125 pence, next month's US exchange rate at 5.625 yuan, and US exchange rate at 3 shillings 14.4375 pence, a decrease of 0.03125 yuan and 0.015625 yuan for the US exchange rate compared to the previous day.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Fluctuates

### Increased Interest in the Gold Market from Buyers

Yesterday's gold market saw a fluctuating black market price that reversed and increased again. The price hovered around the 6,100 yuan mark. People's confidence was wavering but firm, indicating that the Japanese were unable to advance south and their attitude had softened, which became more obvious. Therefore, although there were rumors that the Japanese army continued to land on Hainan Island, it was generally considered unfounded. The foreign exchange market also tightened, leading to a high opening in the morning, which instantly jumped to over 6,100 yuan. The silver banks briefly sold small amounts to 6,070 yuan. The exchange market reported softening, and the gold shops Chengji, Rencheng Yong, and securities firms continuously absorbed, leading to a gradual increase. In the afternoon, it rose to 6,160 yuan. However, as the US dollar rebounded, Chengji (representing Western merchants) and bill merchants forcefully sold, causing it to fall back to within 100 yuan, ultimately closing at 6,125 yuan, an increase of 90 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was over 20,000 taels. Swapping February to March delivery saw a buyer's premium of 40 yuan. There were no sellers offering premiums afterward. For spot gold, Deji released 50 taels from Zhongxing, with the forward price 380 yuan higher. Later, the price decreased. Zhongxing then released 10 taels from Fukang Yong, with a premium of only 330 yuan. The price rebounded at noon, and there were buyers in the afternoon at a premium of 360 yuan. The prices for ornaments and official gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Good for 90 Yuan

In the early morning, people were extremely excited, and there was no shortage of buyers. Therefore, the opening price soared to 6,090 yuan, an increase of 55 yuan compared to the previous day's high. After opening, it further increased by over 100 yuan in a heated atmosphere, reaching 6,120 yuan. Soon, Hengji and Dafeng had intentions to sell and successively sold out, leading to a decline. The lowest point was 6,070 yuan. However, because the exchange market was flat with a tendency to soften, there were still many inclined to buy. Rencheng Yong and Chengji and others searched and gradually increased, rising to 6,130 yuan. However, Dafeng and Xinlanyong wanted to sell at high prices, and it was suppressed to 6,085 yuan. At this time, another buyer suddenly emerged, and Shunyuan, Chengji, Tongkang Yong and others vigorously purchased, and the trend became stronger, once rising to 6,148 yuan. However, Xinfeng Yong sold again, so it fell back to 6,115 yuan at noon. The result was a stable close at 6,130 yuan. The market opened flat and weak in the afternoon, at 6,120 yuan. The gold shops helped each other to stir up the buying trend, raising it to a high point of 6,160 yuan. Later, Chengji, Xinfeng Yong, and Rencheng Yong seized the opportunity to quickly sell, so it spiraled downwards, closing at 6,090 yuan. Before the close, Xiangxing and Yong and others made fragmented purchases, slowly returning to high, and as a result, it reached 6,125 yuan at the close, an increase of 90 yuan compared to the previous day. The closing price of 6,191 yuan based on the US dollar exchange rate of 5.625, and the actual price of 66 yuan. The total fluctuation for the day was 90 yuan. The selling price of the current gold sold by the spot gold shop was more than 10 yuan higher than the spot gold (spot), and the purchase was 30 yuan lower than the sale.

Ornamental Gold Alone Did Not Increase

The exchange price of gold jewelry in silver shops has never changed. Datonghang hangs 660 yuan, and the new Tonghang is similar to the previous price, and the purchase is 40 yuan lower.

### US Dollar Fluctuates

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold prices suddenly turn up again. The prices of British and American gold pounds also increased by one yuan each. The price of British gold bills remained unchanged, and the market situation stabilized. The price of US gold bills fluctuated, initially increasing slightly by 4.8 jiao, then gradually rising to 5.4 jiao, but then retreating to 4.4 jiao. In the afternoon, it recovered to 5.8 jiao, and finally settled at 17.45 yuan, an increase of 1 jiao compared to the previous day. The supply and demand for Hong Kong bills were balanced, and the market price stabilized. The price of Japanese gold notes gradually became stable, and the evening market remained at the original price of 1.74 yuan. There was a slight demand for Korean notes, and the market price increased, with the evening market slightly at 1.365 yuan.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Slightly Rebounded, Public Bonds Showed Mixed Ups and Downs

Although multiple parties were still trying to push up the black market price of public bonds yesterday, their strength had weakened. In the quiet and peaceful buying and selling, the market price slowly weakened. In the early morning, Xinfu first bought, raising the opening price to 6.5 yuan. Although it continued to pull up after entering, its strength was insufficient. After reaching 6.5 yuan for the second time, it gradually weakened. Although Xiekang, Dingkang, Hongda and others bought in, there were no large numbers. Lianhe, Tongshun, Xinhua, Runde and others successively sold out, and the noon closing price was 6.05 yuan. In the afternoon, Xinfu continued to buy in, but the number was limited. The opening price broke the 6 yuan mark. Xiexing, Yuanrun, and Runde slightly bought in, while Xinhua was still selling out. Tongshun and Xieda also cut their positions. The afternoon market fell by another 3-4 jiao, and as a result, except for Grade B, which was slightly better by 1 jiao, the rest fell by 2.5 to 7 jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 50 shares of Wing On Company were traded at a price of 20 yuan.

The opening of the public stock market was strong, and the shares that were settled with profits were generally absorbed in large quantities. At the close, the buying sentiment was very strong. Jardine Matheson and Wheelock Marden and Jardine Engineering continued to account for the largest number of transactions. The stock prices of various trust companies also made considerable progress. Among rubber stocks, the stocks of Dutch Indian companies were the most outstanding, and the price increased quite vigorously.

A letter from Mr. Wang Gongxian stated, "When I read a certain evening newspaper the day before yesterday, I saw the statistical valuation of a certain trust company and a certain bank company, and I couldn't help but feel emotional. Because the above statistics are usually published on Sundays, why were they published on Thursdays in advance? Because of the tragic decline and crazy rise of gold stocks, the ones who suffered the most were still our Chinese people. Because outsiders cannot know the situation inside the stocks. If manipulators want to sell at high prices, they pretend to buy themselves, and at the same time issue dividends and bonus shares, but in fact they have secretly entrusted others to sell. Such as a certain bank company, it rose from 32 yuan to 49.5 yuan, and the manipulator sold out. Chinese people thought that the profit was great and there were also bonus shares, so they bought in. In three weeks, the price tragically fell to 15.5 yuan, and many victims among readers and friends. This time, unexpectedly, the situation suddenly became tight, and the stock suddenly fell, so that the manipulators could not sell out. From the current point of view, the situation is getting worse and worse, and the manipulators of stocks will have to find a way to sell out and escape. They will definitely think of tempting methods, raise stock prices, and trap the stock on the heads of blindly following compatriots, so that the manipulators themselves can escape. I myself am an experienced person and have suffered a lot. Seeing that the manipulators are using their old tricks again, I am here to advise you not to be fooled again."

The board of directors of Pumatay Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by De Kang Foreign Company, has approved the surplus for the year ending October 1940, totaling over 127,000 national currency yuan. In addition to the interim dividend that has been distributed, 8 cents per share of national currency, it is proposed to continue to distribute the final dividend, 2 jiao per share of national currency, a total of 2 jiao and 8 fen of national currency. The annual general meeting of shareholders will be held on March 19th.

London, 20th (Thursday) telegram: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts and Far East British merchant companies' stocks remained stagnant today. Only the shares of HSBC Bank reported fluctuations. The British registered shares rose by 2 pounds, with a price of 74 pounds, and the Hong Kong registered shares fell by 1 pound, with a price of 76 pounds. There was trading without a market, and the rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Industry's Thinking is Stable, the Yarn Market Slightly Increases, Double Horse Nears the 1,300 Yuan Mark

The yarn market is stable, but the trend is slightly upward. At the same time, although there is no significant development in actual transactions, sporadic purchases continue unabated. Therefore, the industry's thinking is relatively stable, and the market price has slightly increased. What the future holds depends on whether the actual sales are booming or not. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,296 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,270 yuan. The afternoon started at 1,295 yuan, fell to 1,287 yuan, and the final price was 1,290 yuan. Today, 400 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong.

The Double Horse market opened in the morning, and because the sentiment improved in the afternoon of the previous day, and most people were optimistic about the next step, even if the prices were weak, some people still bought in. The floor was not as alarming as the day before, but rather stable. The first pan price was 1,270 yuan, and buyers followed one after another. The market shouted for purchases again, and gradually rose to 1,296 yuan. It was then heard that the exchange rate and gold prices were both flat. In addition, the current sales were not very prosperous, and those who made profits came to sell out again, falling to 1,280 yuan. At this time, there were quite a few buyers. There were four or five rounds back and forth between 1,281 yuan and 1,285-6 yuan. Until the closing time, because the gold price was firm and rising, the market was revitalized, and the closing price was 1,289 yuan. It was found that the statistics of transactions in half a day were 6,593 packages. The amount of the quantity purchased by each gangkou is listed on the left,

Hong Kong 410 Ningbo Total 33, the same country 6, 150 Total 6, 593

### Cotton Transactions Rely Only on Peers

The current cotton situation is slightly stable, but the factory's needs still show little signs of improvement. However, the mutual buying and selling among peers is more active, so the market is rising. Today, 30 packages of cotton were transported to Hong Kong.

The New York cotton market, because the spot transaction is good and the Wall Street stock is strong, so the purchase intentions of all parties are frequently increased, and the market situation has entered a strong and active state. As a result, the closing price was 4 to 13 pound sounds higher than the previous day.

There was no major change in Indian cotton. Yesterday's forecast was slightly higher by about one rupee.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, yesterday's yarn market had no major changes, and the situation in various aspects was still favorable for the purchase of raw cotton. Therefore, there were still several cases of mutual buying and selling among peers. As for the factory, it has not yet started large-scale procurement.

### Piece Goods: Twill Fine Cloth Alone is Firm

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was slightly firm, and people's minds were rising together. Dyeing factories on this street purchased low-priced grey fabrics, such as fine cloth and twill. The selling prices of goods have turned firm. Fugui fine cloth was sold in the morning for 40 yuan, and the asking price in the afternoon was 40.05 yuan. Fugui twill was sold for 34 yuan, and the market was sold for 34.5 yuan. As a result, the price of each piece of fine cloth and twill from various stalls increased by 2.5 jiao to 7.5 jiao. Coarse cloth and bleached and dyed cloth were stable. Dyeing factories on this street purchased over 300 pieces of grey fabric. Wholesale retail shops sold over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, poplin, bleached and dyed goods in scattered quantities. The inventory of the Guangdong-Hong Kong gang continued to be loaded out, and new additions were still scarce, with close to 100 pieces being transacted. The Zhejiang-Fujian gang transacted 50-60 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth.

Eastern Cloth: The market atmosphere turned firm, and the goods tended to rise. The closing price of white goods, Longtou fine cloth, was 44.5 yuan per piece, a rebound of 7.5 jiao. Because dyeing factories on this street searched for middle-grade fine cloths of various brands, each piece soared by about 1 yuan. The price of colored goods, Four Gentlemen Serge, 1.235 yuan, was also raised by about 2 cents per yard.

Exports: Today (22nd), 367 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 100 pieces were shipped to Yantai, and another 350 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Rises by Several Jiao

Yesterday's sugar market trend was flat. The association's declared price for 24 coarse white spot goods was 81.7 yuan at the company's warehouse, up 2 jiao, and 81.1 yuan at the outside warehouse. The February end order was 81.2 yuan. Taikoo Chebai B Mark's price was 80.08 yuan at the East warehouse and 81.5 yuan at the West warehouse, up 1 jiao. DY Mark's price was 80 yuan at the West warehouse, up 5 fen. HHX Mark's price was 79.5 yuan at the West warehouse. The spot price for Dutch red was 62 yuan, and 62.4 yuan at the company's warehouse. On the 21st, 3,200 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong.

### North and South Goods: Golden Needles Weakened and Then Strengthened

Although the recent sales of golden needle vegetables have been dull, the ground is still firm. As the declared prices of production in Datong and Xuzhou are still difficult to calculate, the prices cannot be loosened. It was found that the lowest price for Datong vegetables was 118 yuan, but it soon rose again, opening at 128 yuan. In terms of the actual situation, it is difficult to loosen the prices for the time being.

### Coal: Coking Coal Prices Abnormally High

The spot price of coking coal has increased recently due to the sporadic arrival of goods and the rising production costs. In addition, a certain iron smelting plant in this city has searched for large quantities, resulting in the depletion of old stocks, and the prices have soared. The black market price of Zhongxing coking coal has been quoted at 480 yuan, which is shocking. Kaiping coke is 320 yuan, Taiwan coke is 260 yuan, and additional transportation costs are added for delivery from the warehouse.

### Japan's Hesitant Advance to the South: Comments from Shanghai-Based Japanese Military Claim the U.S. and Britain are Disrupting the Pacific Status Quo, Likening Japan to a Dove Forced to Incubate a Snake

Since Japan's ambition to advance southward became increasingly blatant, the United States and Britain have resolved to halt Japan's continued aggression, even if it means resorting to military action. Consequently, both countries reiterated their advisories to withdraw their overseas citizens from the Far East, while simultaneously establishing defenses in Singapore and Guam. This proactive approach has caused considerable alarm in Japan, which has, on the one hand, feigned composure and, on the other, revealed intentions for peace. However, the United States and Britain prioritize actions over empty words, and their firm stance appears unshakeable. In its frustration, Japan has resorted to blaming the United States and Britain. This is evidenced by the statements of Japanese military spokesman Akiyama, and there is no reason to doubt their veracity.

Severe Criticism of Others, No Self-Reflection

Yesterday, at a reception for Western reporters, Japanese military spokesman Akiyama shockingly condemned the United States and Britain for being the first to disrupt the Pacific status quo, claiming that "Britain was the one who cancelled the Anglo-Japanese alliance, and the United States was the one who ruined Japanese-American trade. Therefore, Japan is constantly sacrificed by the United States and Britain." The spokesman used the analogy of a dove incubating an egg, saying, "The dove is a symbol of peace, but the egg is actually a snake. The dove is Japan, and the United States and Britain establishing defenses in Singapore and Guam, and sending Australian troops in a steady stream to Malaya, what is this behavior if not that of a snake? Japan is now like a dove forced to incubate a snake." He continued, "On one side of the Pacific, one shore is clamoring for war, and that is America. The other shore is singing the praises of peace, and that is Japan, on the other side of the Pacific." The spokesman also mentioned the words of automobile magnate Ford, "Let Britain and Germany fight it out," claiming that "President Roosevelt's foreign policy is imbued with this kind of thinking."

The Entire United States is Moving Towards Unity

An editorial in the English-language "China Press" stated that with each passing day, the sound of Japan's cries diminishes, while the voice of the United States grows stronger. A few weeks ago, Japan was filled with militant calls, while the United States remained silent. Now, Japan presents itself as a misunderstood peacemaker, while the United States has suddenly roused itself, issuing the voice of 130 million people united in purpose. A month ago, Japanese newspapers were filled with claims that seizing the Dutch East Indies would be as easy as turning one's hand, and that the United States would regret it if it dared to challenge them. And their spokesmen were loudly proclaiming that Japan would use force against anyone who dared to hinder their "unshakable policy."

America's Attitude: The Sword is Drawn

But the United States has suddenly drawn its sword, making it impossible to ignore. At this moment, Japan's belligerent attitude has suddenly cooled. Some may see this as a coincidence, but we believe otherwise. Previously, Tokyo's rhetoric was nothing but threats of war, but now it has all changed to talk of peace. Previously, the United States remained silent, but now the House of Representatives is discussing the Guam defense bill, and the atmosphere in the chamber is filled with a determination to confront Japan. Only one congressman opposes the bill. In light of Japan's words and actions since joining the Axis powers on September 27th of last year, no one will accuse the United States of provocative behavior. America is merely preparing to resist external aggression against it. Japan is simply getting what it asked for.

Japan's Misjudgment of America

The Guam defense is the first step in America's direct response to Japan in the Pacific. When this bill passed the House of Representatives, there was only one dissenting vote, which can be considered unanimous passage. The shift in national public opinion in the United States is evident, as this bill had been presented to Congress for a year but failed to pass. Japan has made misjudgments more than once, but the reckless behavior of the past four months is a record high. With its perverse intentions, it has aroused America's unwavering determination and spurred America's defense preparations. Japan has now transformed itself again, switching to a pleasant and harmonious tone. Unfortunately, America's nature is different, and it cannot sing a duet with them.

### Rumors of Yu Qiaqing's Assassination are Pure Fabrication

For days, some parties have been spreading rumors that Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese councilor of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was attacked and injured by thugs on the 14th of this month in front of the Hang-chow Club on Guangdong Road and has been admitted to a certain hospital for treatment. This has aroused the attention of various parties for a time. However, on the evening of the 18th of this month, when Municipal Council Secretary-General Philip Fellinger held a farewell banquet for Japanese Deputy Secretary-General Isabuchi Hidehiko at the Shanghai Club, Mr. Yu was invited to accompany him, which proves that the rumor that Mr. Yu was assassinated is completely untrue. Moreover, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, a reporter from the Ta Chung News Agency had a telephone conversation with Mr. Yu, who answered the call himself, which further proves that Mr. Yu is in good health.

### "Special Police Headquarters" Rumored to be Established: Gambling Ban Ordered Yesterday

It is said that the various small gambling dens in the Shanghai West area (commonly known as "yellow cattle sheds") have ceased operations on their own accord in the past two days.

The English-language "China Press" reported that the "Municipal Police Bureau" today issued an order requiring all gambling dens in Shanghai West to close down completely before the "Special Police" is established on March 1st. According to the "Continental Times," the Shanghai West "Special Police Headquarters" will be established soon.

It is understood that such positive measures by the "Police Bureau" are aimed at achieving a "guarantee of safety" in the security of all areas under the jurisdiction of the "Municipal Government."

Military Parade Temporarily Suspended This Year; Defense is Important, No Time for Exercises

According to an announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Board has approved the recommendation of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commandant to decide not to hold the annual Shanghai Volunteer Corps Grand Review this year and to replace it with individual inspections of each unit. The reason is that most of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps members have been assigned to Zone B for defense duties since August of last year and are still stationed there. Each Shanghai Volunteer Corps Grand Review requires considerable preparation and exercises. As for individual unit inspections, if they are held before the end of the training period, they do not require special preparation. For this reason, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Grand Review has been suspended for the time being, but this does not mean that this review will not be held again in the coming year.

### French Municipal Council Studies Administrative Expenses: Economic Committee

Since the French Concession "tax on Chinese" society donated to the Municipal Council in July of last year, the parent has added donations twice in the past six months starting in January of this year. "The ratio of donations: on July 1, 1940, the principal tax and surtax on housing donations increased from 17% to 22%, an increase of 5%." This time, the renewed donation increased from 22% to 30%, an increase of 8%. Other donations, such as land donations, meeting fees, and other miscellaneous taxes, have also increased significantly. Some of the increased amounts have reached more than double, which is not something that the average taxpayer can afford. After negotiations with the French Consul General and the French Municipal Council, it was stated that it was difficult to cancel the original proposal due to the Council's expenses. The food asked the Chinese councilors to continue negotiations in the board of directors. Now it is known that the French Municipal Council has established an economic committee to respect taxpayers' opinions, which is responsible for studying whether there is room for frugality in the Council's various administrative expenses, with the aim of reducing taxpayers' burden by reducing expenditures.

### Ongoing Donations to the New P'u Yu T'ang: Donations, No Matter How Big or Small, Are Appreciated by Those Who Receive Them

Since this newspaper reported on the donation situation of the New P'u Yu T'ang, the various collection points have received a large number of donations, which have been published successively. However, the hall receives no less than 1,000 orphans, the old, the weak, and the disabled. The expenses are huge, requiring at least 16,000 yuan or more per month. Calculating on an annual basis, it already requires 200,000 yuan. Now the hall's funds are exhausted, and it is about to run out of food. It is hoped that readers will continue to contribute enthusiastically or solicit donations from relatives and friends. Donations, no matter how big or small, are appreciated by those who receive them. The donations received yesterday are recorded below: Yuan Yuan Lien Yi Society 1,000 yuan, Jiang Zhou Sheng Xin. Ming Ji 300 yuan each, Yuan Ji Leather Number. Zai Yuqing. Lin Boduolu each 100 yuan, Ge Jingde 50 yuan, Zhu Ji. Zhou Dehu each 20 yuan, Anonymous. Chen Ping. Zhang Junhao. Qian Changhe. Huang Guohua. Miss Shen each 10 yuan, Tao Fuzheng 5 yuan. The addresses of the donation collection points and this newspaper's local news are all published.

High Tide Overtops Roads; Heavy Fog Yesterday Morning

Shanghai was almost shrouded in smoke and fog yesterday morning, the heaviest seen this spring, which greatly hindered traffic. From dawn onwards, it was difficult to distinguish people even at close range. To avoid collisions, trams leaving the factory early in the morning all drove with their lights on, as did other vehicles. The Whangpoo River was covered in fog, with the water and sky blending into one. All kinds of sails were temporarily suspended, and ships stopped entering and leaving the port. The heavy fog dissipated after 9 am, and normal conditions were restored.

Since yesterday, there has been a sudden high tide in the Huangpu River. The tide reached more than ten feet above the high tide mark from 1 p.m., causing tidal water to overflow onto the roads of the Bund, Nissho Building, and Alabaster Road, with an accumulation of water of an inch or so. The tide gradually receded after about an hour.

### Municipal Council Commends Deserving Chinese Constables

Chinese Constable No. 3140 of the Public Concession apprehended a bandit on Amoy Road and seized a pistol. Chinese Constable No. 2911 apprehended an armed criminal near New Zau Road. Chinese Constable No. 1536 apprehended a robber on Shanhai Pass Road and seized a pistol. Chinese Constable No. 553 fought with a bandit on Avenue Edward VII on November 22nd of last year, resulting in the倒 (toppling) of the bandit, but the constable's foot was also injured. The Police Department's Rewards Committee deemed the constables to be loyal, brave, resourceful, and exceptionally effective, and they were presented to the Council for approval to each receive a second-class medal for special meritorious service to encourage them.

### Proposal to Improve the Current Situation of the Public Concession (2)

— Nash

Reform Plan

During the five years from 1925 to 1930, the lenient concessions made by Britain and the United States to the expression of Chinese nationalism had produced revolutions in the social life, economic life, and municipal life of the Public Concession. For example, Chinese women could be seen in foreign dance halls, which was previously unimaginable. And because Chinese women are beautiful in figure, they make foreign women appear small. In other important undertakings, it can also be seen that Chinese people have a later-comer advantage over foreigners. Young Chinese can now trade directly with foreign countries without relying on Westerners for introductions. In municipal life, the theory of Chinese people also has an amazing organization. In 1928, Chinese people were also included in municipal organs that were previously monopolized by foreigners, but Chinese people still felt that the concessions made by foreigners were too slow, so the Feetham Reform Plan was produced, but the Chinese still felt that it was not enough. In fact, China at that time was only able to ask Britain and the United States for and obtain the rights that it should have had the ability to do. Even the unequal consular jurisdiction could be abolished. But the reason why the goal was not achieved at that time was not due to the intransigence of foreigners, but because China itself was not yet capable and because of the obstacles from Japan.

Gradual Method

During the brilliant period of China's political recovery, it demanded that its unlimited sovereignty be expressed in the Chinese Public Concession. Britain and the United States, based on the investigation by Judge Feetham, advocated a gradual approach, starting with a "transitional era" before discussing the "return of the Concession." Japan, on the other hand, advocated the immediate abolition of the Concession. As a result, the reconciliation between the Chinese concept of sovereignty and the existence of the British and French concessions was interrupted.

Serious Challenge

China's national and political development in the Far East was stalemated by Japan's obstruction, resulting in rapid degeneration. The same situation existed in the Shanghai Public Concession. The municipal evolution contributed by the 1931 Feetham Reform Plan was stalled by major political events. The Sino-Japanese Shanghai War broke out five years after 1932, and the full-scale Sino-Japanese War began in 1937. Thus, the two main protagonists in the Public Concession, namely Britain and the United States on the one hand and Japan on the other, had to redefine their policies to cope with the new situation. After a short but heroic resistance in the Shanghai area, the Chinese army moved westward, and the political organs also went with them. As a result, the triangular politics of Sino-foreign relations (namely China, Britain, and the United States) changed into a confrontation between Britain and the United States and Japan. As for the "Chinese organs" in the city, they are only a passive role. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, it has entered its fourth year. The fundamental tradition of international cooperation by which the Shanghai Public Concession is maintained has encountered a serious challenge. The outbreak of the European War has made this challenge even more tense.

Need for Cooperation

If there is one lesson we can learn from this, it is that if other driving forces such as "nationalism" and "sovereignty issues" extend into the Shanghai area during this period, there will be no peace in the city, and the chaos of order and the state of anarchy will continue to prevail. Because before the military has ended, there is little hope of integrating the different policies of England, the United States, Japan, and China. In this extreme situation, unless a miracle happens, all of Shanghai will sooner or later be swept into the vortex of chaos. However, we would rather not let this melee be delayed any longer, or there may be hope for a miracle. In any case, we, as citizens of Shanghai, should at least fulfill one obligation, that is, we should each exercise restraint and not cause a full-scale war in the Far East, even if war is inevitable, do not let our respective national goals, behaviors, or policies cause it.

### Japanese Abduction of Laborers in the Northern District Becomes Increasingly Serious; Even Employees Hired by the Police Force are Not Exempt; Hundreds of Chinese Forced to Work

The English-language "China Press" reported today (the 21st) that it has learned from responsible sources that the Japanese Army "Labor Corps" has been engaged in large-scale activities in the Northern District of the Public Concession, forcing large numbers of Chinese to perform labor for the Japanese Army. Japanese officials have denied that such activities are taking place in the area north of the Suzhou Creek occupied by the Japanese and have reportedly notified Japanese newspapers in the city to "take steps to curb such malicious news."

Forced by Force, Unable to Resist

However, according to reliable sources, those abducted in the past few days included an employee hired by the Yangtzepoo Police Force. It is said that the responsible personnel of the Northern District Branch of the Municipal Council's Health Department have also taken steps to ensure that their Chinese employees are not exposed to any danger and have issued armbands to the Chinese employees of the Branch for identification purposes. It is also said that hundreds of Chinese in the Northern District have been forced to work for the Japanese Army. Most of them are forcibly pushed onto trucks and driven away, unable to resist. Therefore, the Chinese in the Northern District are all panicked. It has been investigated that the Japanese army engaged in similar behavior in the northern part of the Public Concession in the second half of last year.

### Gaussmüller to Travel North Today

French Ambassador to China, Gaussmüller, will leave Shanghai for Tianjin by ship today, as he is in urgent need of presiding over the affairs of the embassy in North China. The ambassador's wife and Secretary Defran will accompany him on the ship. They will stay in the north for several weeks and return to Shanghai in early March. They also plan to go to Chongqing to maintain close contact with the National Government.

### New Japanese Deputy General Manager Takes Office Next Week

According to a report from the Public Works Bureau, Teramoto Hiroshi has been appointed as the Japanese Deputy General Manager to succeed Ibusuki Hidehiko, and is scheduled to take office next Monday (the 24th). Teramoto was born in Japan in August 1907. He passed the Japanese Foreign Service Examination in 1932 and graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University the following year. In March of that year, he began serving in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was subsequently dispatched to the Japanese Embassy in London as a counselor, and in 1934, he was transferred to the position of counselor. In 1935, he was assigned to the Japanese Embassy in Rome. In 1937, he was assigned to the Japanese Embassy in Berlin. In February 1938, he was appointed as Secretary of the European and American Affairs Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In July of the same year, he was appointed as Consul at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai.

During a reception for local Japanese newspaper reporters the day before yesterday, Teramoto stated that he would thoroughly study the affairs of the Public Works Bureau and that it would take a year to complete the study. Therefore, it would be unrealistic to expect him to achieve results quickly.

### Postal Workers Demand Director Zha Goes to Chongqing to Plead for Subsidies

The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union had drafted articles, and at the beginning of this month, they presented a request to Zha Peilin, the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, demanding an increase in relief subsidies of 100 yuan per person per month. They also requested that this amount serve as the base, and that for every 100% increase in the cost of living index, an additional 30 yuan be added, using the cost of living index published by the Public Works Bureau of the International Settlement as the standard. Yesterday, representatives were appointed to request that the request be forwarded to the Kunming General Administration for review as soon as possible. Director Zha agreed to send a telegram by express mail next Monday or Tuesday. The representatives also requested that Director Zha personally go to Chongqing to plead their case, or directly report everything to the highest authorities.

### Extortion from Barbers Leads to Arrest by Japanese Military Police; Road Workers Strike Again Yesterday

The "Continental Daily" reported that workers at the American United Industries Corporation on Pinlang Road had made demands for improved treatment at the beginning of last week. The management refused to start negotiations, citing the demands as "unreasonable." The workers then went on strike. Mediation by a third party was ineffective.

American United Industries Strike: Management's Attitude

It is heard that the outcome of this strike depends entirely on the attitude of the management. However, the management has not yet expressed a willingness to accept the workers' demands and has notified the workers that negotiations cannot proceed unless they first return to work. According to Japanese sources, on Wednesday, extortionists were apprehended inside a private residence in a certain alley on Yidingpan Road.

Extortionist Zeng Taken to Special Court No. 1

It was also reported that ten individuals claiming to be "union" members were extorting money from several barbers. They were arrested by the Japanese military police. It was found that on Tuesday, individuals impersonating "union" members were arrested for extortion and taken to Special Court No. 1 for questioning. It is not yet confirmed whether the extortionists arrested by the Japanese military police on Wednesday will also be taken to Special Court No. 1 for questioning.

Road Workers Demand Wage Increase

Temporary workers hired by the Public Works Department of the Public Works Bureau are only working two days a week. Today (the 21st), they gathered at the Suzhou Road storage yard of the Engineering Department, demanding more work. When their demand was rejected, they left the storage yard and went on strike. Furthermore, the strike at the Wuhe Weaving Factory on Kang Nao Road is said to have been resolved this morning. The management agreed to increase each worker's pay by ten yuan, and those who do not take a single day off each month will receive an additional four days' wages. The workers then returned to work. Furthermore, the strike by leather goods workers is being mediated by the Police Department of the Public Works Bureau and is expected to be resolved soon.

### Modern Man and Woman Commit Suicide in the New New Hotel; Man Dead, Woman in Critical Condition; Reasons for Suicide Awaiting Investigation

At around 2 PM the day before yesterday, a fashionable man and woman, dressed in luxurious clothing, went to the New New Hotel, owned by the New New Company on Nanjing Road. They chose Room 404 on the fourth floor to stay in. After paying the rent, they walked out hand in hand. They did not return until around 11 PM that night, and then they closed the door and went to bed. The night shift tea boy initially paid no attention to the fashionable couple. They had already decided to die together inside the room. It was not until around 12 PM yesterday that the morning shift tea boy intended to enter the room to clean it. He discovered that the door was tightly locked and sensed something was wrong. He then managed to climb in through the window. He saw the male and female guests lying on the bed, both wearing underwear, barely breathing. He also found two medicine bottles and a letter on the dressing table. He knew that they had taken poison. He immediately reported the situation to the front desk, who in turn reported it to the police station. An ambulance was called to take them to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, upon arrival at the hospital, the man had already died due to severe poisoning and could not be saved. Although the woman received emergency treatment, her life was also in danger. It was later learned that the deceased man was named Gu Ke-ren, around 30 years old, and the woman was named Tang Gen-mei, 25 years old. However, whether these are their real names is currently being investigated by the police station, who have taken the suicide note back to investigate the cause of death.

### Detective Opens Fire on Robbers, Wounding One Fatally

Hua Detective Du, badge number 72, of the French Police, hired a rickshaw to go home from the Great World at 11:20 PM on the 19th. While passing in front of number 389 on the west end of Poplar Road, Belle Road, two robbers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. They pressed down on the rickshaw poles on both sides of the rickshaw that the detective was riding in, ordered the rickshaw puller to stop, and ordered Detective Du to get out of the rickshaw to rob him. The two robbers reached into their pockets, pretending to be reaching for guns. Detective Du knew that he was being robbed, so he got out of the rickshaw and drew his gun, opening fire. One robber was shot in the back of the neck and fell to the ground, dying instantly. The other robber fled to number 94 on Gero Road, where he was shot in the buttocks, the bullet piercing his lower abdomen. He fell to the ground and was captured, taken back to the police station, and reported to the head detective. It was learned that the wounded robber's name was Yan Zhao-chang (25 years old, from Pudong, residing in room number 7 of the Yiding Small Inn on Yidingpan Road). He was ordered to be sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. As for the deceased robber, his name was found to be Chen A-san, about 30 years old, with no occupation or address. He had a long history of committing robbery and theft, and had been punished by the courts of both concessions. As no family members were found, the body was handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for encoffining and burial. The details of these events have already been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the wounded robber, Yan Zhao-chang, died at 2 PM yesterday afternoon in Guangci Hospital due to the severity of his injuries. The hospital notified the police station, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for encoffining and burial.

### Purchasing a Radio and Attempting to Return It Unsuccessfully Leads to Lawsuit; Both Sides Hold to Their Arguments and Await Further Review

The Liangyou Wireless Radio Manufacturing Factory Unlimited Company on Beijing Road, which was approved to operate by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and has obtained a license, has a wide sales network for its products. On July 18th of last year, a man named Zhang Xiao-tong (residing at number 11 of Chunhui Lane, Aerjin Road) purchased a five-tube radio from the company for 185 yuan. Several days later, Zhang took the radio to the company and requested to exchange it or get a refund. His reason was that the radio could not receive broadcasts from Chongqing and other places. Therefore, a dispute arose between the two parties. Zhang Xiao-tong recently filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of Special Court No. 1, suing Liangyou Wireless Radio Company and requesting a judgment ordering the return of the purchase price. Based on the complaint, the court, yesterday, ordered a hearing in the Civil Division 3 by Judge Dong. The defendant, Shi Ying-chi, appointed lawyer Wu Xiang-xian to appear in court. The plaintiff also appointed a representative to appear in court. Both sides held to their own arguments. Witnesses Lu Zhong-mei and Lian Yun were present to testify. The disputed radio had previously been sent to the plaintiff's residence for testing. The results showed that it could receive Chongqing broadcasts, but because the broadcaster spoke Cantonese, it could not be understood. The court reviewed the arguments and ordered that another three-day test be conducted, starting today, to see if the Mandarin language could be heard clearly. The case was adjourned to the 24th of this month for further hearing.

### Central Police Apprehends Over Twenty Suspected Thieves; Detained Pending Investigation and Further Questioning

After questioning by Judge Xiao, the motion for detention was granted, and the case was adjourned for further hearing.

### Elderly Man Zhang Gui-tang Dies Suddenly from Heart Attack

Zhang Gui-tang, a local resident of number 213 Jiangyin Street in the South City, 54 years old, visited his friend Li Han-min in room 514 on the fifth floor of the Zhonghui Building on Laobeimen Street in the French Concession at 10 AM yesterday. At 12 PM, Li asked Zhang to stay for lunch. While they were chatting and laughing, Zhang suddenly collapsed from his seat due to heart failure. Li immediately helped him up and sent him to Renji Hospital. Emergency treatment was ineffective, and he died shortly after.

### The Root of Superstition

— Editor

"Now it's already the 20th century, why are there still so many superstitious thoughts?" a young friend asked me with emotion.

This is a strange thing that is not strange.

In this big world, there are countless small worlds. Everyone has their own small world. His environment, his education, his experience, his thoughts, the books he reads, the people he interacts with, and the places his footsteps reach, are the boundaries of his world.

Therefore, in this 20th-century society, there are many people who still live in the small world of medieval society and thought; in this seemingly prosperous Shanghai, there are many hungry and cold people; in this enlightened and scientific world, there are also many pitiful people who are imprisoned in the traps of ignorance, foolishness, and superstition. The truth of society is originally like this.

Speaking of breaking superstition, one cannot help but think of the movement of destroying idols and demolishing temples done by a group of vigorous youths. Their motives are undoubtedly pure, but their methods often only arouse greater aversion to new ideas. Our work is not that simple. We must instill them with scientific and enlightened thinking, we must rescue them from the deep well of superstition, and make them understand the narrowness of their past horizons and the errors of their thinking.

Eliminating superstition should be done thoroughly. What is the root of superstition? Ignorance. Ignorance is the root of superstition!

### Women Born in the Year of the Sheep

— Shan Li

After reading that article on the Free Talk a few days ago, "It's Difficult to Be a Woman," who wouldn't sigh and express sympathy for those unfortunate women? But the difficulties for women are not limited to this. As far as I personally know, once women are born in the year of the sheep, their lives will be more painful than any other women.

"A woman born in the year of the sheep often carries seven parts of bitterness; if she doesn't ruin her husband's family, she will ruin her own family." This is an unreasonable old saying that has been circulating for a long time. Unfortunately, women born in the year of the sheep are destined for this fate. If their family's situation deteriorates greatly after they are born, then they will unfortunately be regarded as the great enemy by their own parents, and few will not be sent to a nunnery! Once they reach adulthood, they will encounter pain everywhere. Sometimes, when she and a man are happily living a life of love, if he or his parents suddenly discover that she was born in the year of the sheep, then their love will be torn to pieces by the giant hand of a demon. Therefore, it is very difficult for a young woman born in the year of the sheep to find a spouse. Even if she finds one, she will mostly not be favored by her husband and in-laws.

I have a cousin who fell in love with a woman born in the year of the sheep, but their love was later destroyed by this old saying. It is said that his parents were even Christians! But what's the use of that? Believing in religion is one thing, believing in old sayings is another. In China, there is no sense of contradiction.

I am a man born in the year of the sheep. According to my parents, they had already decided two months before I was born that if I were a girl, then they would immediately send me to a nunnery without any doubt. Fortunately, I am not a girl.

I often find it strange that in such a civilized society, why are there still so many people who believe in long-standing and rotten, unreasonable old sayings? Are people not progressing? But why do these deceptive old sayings still follow us? I will never understand, I am strange. (End)

### Washington's Strict Military Discipline

— Hua Zhi

Today (February 22nd) is the birthday anniversary of George Washington, the father of the United States. The independence of the United States owes much to Washington. Therefore, Washington's military methods are especially worthy of our attention.

Washington's military manual was publicly exhibited in Chicago, attracting many connoisseurs. This booklet was written by Washington when he commanded the Independent Army in 1776 and includes several hand-signed orders, which can give a glimpse of his military discipline.

It is said that a habit of cursing was popular in the American Independent Army. Washington deeply hated this, so he specially signed an order, instructing all officers: "Cursing and swearing are stupid and improper behaviors. Speaking some blasphemous words is nothing more than a vulgar and despicable crime. May the officers set an example and not allow the bad habit of cursing to become popular in the army."

Washington also attached great importance to the morals of soldiers. The manual records his instructions to soldiers who secretly picked fruits from private orchards, condemning them.

Most of Washington's military manual has been lost. Only the portions from July, August, and September of 1776 remain in the New York City Command Headquarters, and were later acquired by the International Art Combination Company. In addition to the manual, the publicly exhibited items also included Washington's measuring instruments, buttons, shoe buckles, and a tortoise shell snuff box.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Mr. Luo looked like he had eaten Coptis chinensis, unable to say anything. On the other hand, Director Ma, who had achieved fame and success, still had a smug smile on his face, as if he was not concerned about the people who were working with him in the hall.

At the same time, Mrs. Luo, who had just moved from a dilapidated house to a magnificent new residence, encountered some boredom in her extreme satisfaction.

"Oh! This is our new son-in-law! Why hasn't he gone over there yet?" She was lying on a soft couch, watching the person in the photo busily greeting people back and forth in the house. It wasn't until the auspicious time had passed that she still didn't see him go to the place where the wedding ceremony was being held, so she quietly asked an old woman who was brought from Beijing by Yuan Zhenshoushi (garrison commander).

"This is our Seventh Master! Old lady, he is the great nephew of the new dignitary." An unexpected answer.

"What... what did you say?" Mrs. Luo, who was hemiplegic, almost wanted to jump up from the soft couch.

"He is the nephew of our garrison commander." The old woman repeated.

Mrs. Luo widened her eyes, unable to think of anything to say. Just then, Yuan Shaowen passed by outside the courtyard.

"Sor...ry...!" Mrs. Luo used all her strength to say to the old woman: "Please ask him to come in... I... have something to... ask... him. …"

The old woman immediately rushed to the door and shouted loudly:

"Seventh Master, please come here for a moment, the old lady of Third Auntie wants to talk to you!"

However, by the time Yuan Shaowen stepped into the room, Mrs. Luo was unable to say anything. (37)

### Owe-Debt Ghost

— Ji Gu

The belly of the short woman living in the back building of the neighboring building grew bigger day by day, like a ripe melon that was about to come off the vine. However, she still often squatted by the tap with her big belly to scoop rice, wash vegetables, and wash clothes. While washing, she muttered to herself that her four daughters were "owe-debt ghosts."

The fat woman living in the kitchen came out and chatted with her:

"Is it tiring to keep squatting like this?"

"How can it not be tiring! It's all for the sake of those few owe-debt ghosts..."

"Okay, in a few days, we can eat red eggs! Be sure to send me a few!"

"Don't count on it, it only counts after they're born." Although she said this, she felt quite optimistic in her heart: "I've already given birth to four daughters in a row, this time it should be a son. If it's another…"

The short woman's seven-year-old daughter was playing at the door. The neighboring grandma asked her:

"Has your mom given birth? Was it a younger brother or a younger sister?"

"It's another younger sister. She's chubby and very cute, and cries with a strange loud sound. But Mom said she wants to throw her away..." Suddenly, the older sister, who was making coal briquettes behind her, pushed her hard. "Who said that? Mom said she was going to send the little sister to someone else to raise, who said throw her away?" She even wanted to hit her, scaring her away.

In the evening, the nosy one-eyed girl in the front building asked the short woman's eldest daughter in a low voice:

"Why is there no crying? Where is your little sister?"

"She was sent to someone else."

This morning, a small corpse, the corpse of a plump newborn baby, was found next to the trash can in the alley.

### Hollywood's Flight Fever

— Toad

Recently, Hollywood male and female movie stars have been learning to fly one after another, and many movie stars own a private plane. Every morning, the residents of Pi Fuli Hill are awakened by the rattling sound. This "flight fever" is as popular as the "car fever" that prevailed in the film city 25 years ago, and is extremely popular for a while.

Among them, the one who learns the most diligently is Laurence Olivier, who vowed that after learning, he would join the Royal Air Force to serve his country.

Robert Cummins' "Spinach" plane has long been famous in the film city, worth 30,000 US dollars, and its flight record in the air has exceeded 1,000 hours.

But the one with the longest qualification is Hua Leisi Piley, who started learning to fly in 1925. So far, his flight record has reached 6,000 hours, and he has replaced nine aircraft. In Hollywood, he is the only one who has obtained special permission from Roosevelt to fly anywhere in the United States.

Although Tyrone Bauer's plane has been in use for ten years, his qualifications are very shallow, with only 75 hours of record.

Li Que Yalun was a member of the Royal Air Force in World War I. He was the protagonist of the famous film "Wing" in 1927. He has been researching aviation techniques and recently opened a school.

Robert Taylor's 145-horsepower aircraft is the most modern in the film city. He is very enthusiastic about flying, although his wife, Bai Peilan Standfei, opposes him practicing.

James Stewart is a strongman in the air, recently teaching Olivia Hafland flight skills at six o'clock in the morning every day.

Hafland's brother-in-law, Baila En Yaheng, is also a flying expert. His plane is worth 9,000 yuan. Recently, he is preparing to donate the plane to the British government.

Lei Milun, Jie Fei Lilin, and Wen Maolisi are all unwilling to lag behind, and are practicing secretly. Kan Luoer Folin's adventurous spirit also makes him double his efforts in his aviation skills.

Previously, only Rose Caidetun and Yidina Mankaober were the only female stars in the film city who could fly a plane. Now, however, the famous female stars Ganer Pandelik, Magelan Shaliven, Kesilin Hepburn, Xiulan Rose, An Su, and even Sarah Hatton, who is more than half a century old, are desperately practicing.

Who is Duanmu Lanxin

After Tang Ruoqing was "sick," the Xuan Palace stopped performing for a few days. Today, "New Mei Luo Xiang" is being re-enacted, but Sun Jinglu cannot perform on stage due to "certain reasons." The role of Mei Luo Xiang is played by the newcomer Duanmu Lanxin; in fact, Duanmu Lanxin is not a "newcomer" but a "new name," that is, "Vera" of the Drama Society.

### Scattered Notes on the Literary Scene

— Shou Wu

I recently heard that someone is planning to open a theater on Yu Qiaqing Road, specializing in dialect plays. Since various theater troupes have tried to perform dialect plays, opinions have been divided. I believe that dialect plays can be performed, but attention must be paid to the limitations of time and space, and the actors must be familiar with the local dialect. Therefore, for dialect theater troupes that are being organized, if they truly have the ambition for long-term performances, the actors and the directing staff must pay attention. Whether the script can avoid causing panic is also something that must be paid attention to.

According to news circulating within the circle, Kodak film stock will be sold until it is depleted, and then orders will be renewed with the United States. This is also a small ripple in the midst of the turbulent Pacific situation.

According to a letter from a friend in Chongqing, a number of folk tales and wooden fish books from Hong Kong and Shanghai have been shipped to Chongqing, numbering as many as forty or fifty. However, it is quite doubtful how many of these forty or fifty films will pass inspection and be publicly screened in Free China.

I have heard that there is talk of reorganizing "China Film News," but the details are unknown.

### Shirley Temple Returns to the Silver Screen - Has Signed a Contract with MGM - "School Life is Too Stupid"

— Hui Lin

Shirley Temple has decided to return to the silver screen. She has signed a contract with MGM, with a weekly salary of $2,500. She will co-star with Mickey Rooney in a large number of serial films. When asked for her opinion, Shirley Temple simply replied, "School life is too stupid."

### "Sister Thirteen"

— Fang Yu

"Sister Thirteen" was originally titled "Daughter Hero Biography," written by Li Yuru for Yu Yuqin of the Fushou Troupe before the year of Gengzi. Li, named Zhongyu, also known as Jianghuai Sanren, worked in the Ministry, and in his spare time, he also wrote signboards. He liked to associate with actors. Seeing that Yuqin could both sing martial roles and also excel in female roles, he arranged for her to perform eight episodes of "Daughter Hero Biography," performing the whole thing over eight days. The role assignments were: Yu Yuqin as Sister Thirteen He Yufeng, Lu Huayun as An Ji, Chi Yunqing as An Xuehai, Chen Ruilin as Zhang Jinfeng, and Qian Baofeng as Deng Jiugong; among them, Deng Jiugong was once sung by Tang Changer, Zhang Jinfeng, Big Dog Gao Sibao (Qingkui's father), and Zhao Xianfang all played Sai Shishi, Jia Honglin once played the old servant, the big monk was Dafantong, and the donkey driver was Tang Yuxi. At that time, it caused a sensation. The structure of the play strongly emphasized He Yufeng's loyalty, righteousness, and filial piety. Yu and Lu both became famous because of this play. After Yuqin, Wang Yaoqing also excelled in this play. Yaoqing did not practice stilt-walking, so he advocated using small boots to replace them. Yaoqing's martial arts skills were far inferior to Yuqin's, but her dialogue and demeanor were better than Yu's. Lu Huayun had a disciple named Rong Diexian (Cheng Yanqiu's teacher), who also searched for stilt-walking skills, but followed Yu and imitated Wang. Descendants such as Xun Huisheng's Furong Cao all had stilts but did not use them, choosing convenience and simplicity, and changing to wear small boots. Later generations such as Zhang Eyun, Mao Shilai, Ma Yanfen, Zhao Xiaolan, Zang Languang, Liang Xiujuan, etc., all only followed Xun, and some did not even know that He Yufeng should tread on stilts.

After Wang Yaoqing's voice collapsed, Xun Huisheng took the play from the point where He's father was harmed by treacherous officials, through "Yue Lai Inn," "Nengren Temple," "Mangniu Mountain," "Hongliu Village," "Qingyun Mountain" to "Bow and Inkstone Romance," and named the entire thing "Sister Thirteen," performing the whole thing in one night; adding Furong Cao's Zhang Jinfeng, Jin Zhongren's An Gongzi, Zhang Chunyan's An Xuehai, Wang Lianpu's Deng Jiugong (now played by Jiang Shaoqing), Sun Futing's Zhang Ma, Ma Fulu's former Sai Shishi and latter Dog Teng, Wang Duoshou's donkey driver, every performance was packed. Shang Xiaoyun also co-arranged and performed it, with Shang Fuxia as An Gongzi, Li Baokui as An Xuehai, Fan Baoting as the big monk, Gao Fuyuan as the donkey driver, Jia Duocai as Sai Shishi, Zha Jinkui as the old servant, and Xu Linfu as Zhang Ma. Xun also changed Shang's famous play "Leifeng Pagoda" to "White Snake" and rushed it to the stage. Xun and Shang became estranged because of this. In all fairness, Huisheng at that time was interested in using solemnity, with beauty but not flamboyance, heroic but not unrestrained, bold but not uncouth, not sticking to trivialities, and not overstepping the bounds, the female hero He Yufeng, and considered himself better than Xiaoyun. The "Qingyun Mountain" guarding filial piety scene can also depict He Yufeng's pure filial piety and nobility to the fullest; after Zhang Jinfeng is brought up, the singing of the meeting with Master Deng is so tragic that one cannot bear to hear it to the end; the rebuke of An Ji in the bridal chamber still does not lose the identity of a virtuous woman. There are many who perform this play now, but none are better than Huisheng. Xun will go south to perform in the Golden, and this play should be on the list of must-perform.

The Golden Gate Theater at the intersection of Foch Road and Albert Road is magnificent in architecture, well-equipped, with clear sound, soft lighting, and comfortable seats, and is recognized by movie fans. Now it is striving to select excellent films, sparing no expense, and from March 15th, it will exclusively screen the second run of MGM and RKO Pictures blockbusters, without increasing ticket prices.
