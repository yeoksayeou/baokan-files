### Sha City Japanese Garrison Commander Leads Troops Southward, Repelled by Chinese Forces; Rumor of Japanese Battalion Commander Hayasaka Heavily Wounded; Japanese Troops Attacking Longgang Suffered Losses and Retreated to Shenzhen

Changde: Since the 17th, the Japanese troops from Sha City, Cenhekou, have repeatedly invaded Laoyangjiajing, Jiapu, Dongshi (gradually amassing machines), Xishi Huangjia Township, and other places, suffering heavy blows from the Chinese army each time. They have not succeeded. On the afternoon of the 18th, Hayasaka (commander of the cavalry regiment of the Japanese 39th Division, currently the commander of the Sha City Garrison) led nearly 3,000 of his remaining troops, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with more than 20 artillery pieces and 12 tanks, under the cover of six Japanese aircraft flying low, from Sha City via Shenwan, and invaded southward towards Panzhang Bridge. By evening, they reached the vicinity of Zifusi Temple and launched a fierce attack on the area, engaging in a fierce battle with a certain Chinese unit. By the morning of the 19th, the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties and set fire to Zifusi Temple. Under the cover of thick smoke, they retreated northward. After the Chinese army recaptured Zifusi Temple, they urgently pursued northward and have now crossed the Panzhang Bridge line, tracking and pursuing. According to reports from Chinese troops ambushing the Japanese army en route, Japanese wounded soldiers were transported north all night in an endless stream, and Hayasaka was also seriously injured. Furthermore, Laoyangjia Township and other places were also recaptured by the Chinese army at 4:00 PM on the 19th. The Japanese at Yaowan retreated to Sha City in disarray. (22nd Dispatch)

### After Passage of Lend-Lease Act, American Warships to Visit Singapore; Rumors of Significant Developments in Far East Situation; US Army and Navy Prepare for Contingencies

New York: It is rumored that pro-British factions in the United States, due to the unstable situation in the Pacific, are currently lobbying to have the American fleet stationed in Singapore. Although it is widely believed that naval personnel in the United States do not support the idea of a fleet 7,000 miles away, it is rumored that the State Department at least agrees to send warships to Malaya as soon as possible to demonstrate goodwill. The expected date of departure for the American warships is after the passage of the Lend-Lease Act. At the same time, Japanese residents in the United States are reportedly very concerned about the situation in the Pacific. (22nd Dispatch from Reuters)

Washington: Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters yesterday that he expects significant developments in the Far East soon. He said, "Based on common sense and reasonable inferences from recent developments, there will be significant developments in the Far East in a matter of days." However, he declined to elaborate on his views. (22nd Dispatch from the Associated Press)

Washington: General Marshall stated to the House Military Affairs Committee yesterday that the Army and Navy Departments have taken special steps to deal with all contingencies. To enhance the strength of the Pacific Air Force, the Army Department has assigned a batch of dive bombers and fighters to naval command. The passenger ship "President Washington" has also been transferred to the Navy for troop transport. In addition, comments are widespread regarding Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman George's indication that serious events will occur within ten days. (21st Dispatch from Havas)

Washington: The most reliable sources stated yesterday that American High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, may be recalled to the United States to serve as an advisor in the State Department. The position was created due to the pressure of war. (22nd Dispatch from the Associated Press)

New York: Local authorities stated that New York City will soon conduct a blackout drill, with lights in various districts being extinguished on a scheduled basis to test air defense effectiveness.

Washington: President Roosevelt criticized the disclosure of the statements made by Army Chief of Staff Marshall at a closed meeting of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, stating that this disclosure raised ethical and patriotic questions regarding the distribution of Marshall's remarks by members of the Military Affairs Committee and newspaper editors, publishers, and radio broadcasters. At this time of global turmoil, certain events regarding the national defense of the United States should be kept secret. The President also stated that Marshall had submitted a detailed report to the White House regarding his remarks to the Military Affairs Committee, and that he found that all the various external leaks were different from the report he received. (22nd Dispatch from Reuters)

Washington: The Senate continued to debate the Lend-Lease Act yesterday, during which three senators criticized the bill.

Australian Troops Begin Work, Fighting for Democracy

Malaya: Australian Commander-in-Chief Bennerd recently praised Malaya for the excellence of its landing and transportation preparations, stating that these preparations had allowed the Australian troops arriving in Malaya to be quickly established. He also said that the Australian troops have now started work and are settled in this new environment where they must engage in special tactical training. He stated that the Australians will soon feel comfortable here, and that in a few weeks, they will be the same as they were when they left Australia. He also said that although the Australian troops are small, they are very pleased to be stationed here, as they recognize that Malaya, which constitutes the Australian outpost, is threatened and must be defended. He also stated, "We are as happy to be here as anywhere, because we are now participating in the work of attacking the Germans, no matter where we are." He also said that the troops under his command are almost entirely volunteers from all walks of life, and that the Australian people have unanimously moved towards the goal of fighting for democracy. Since the beginning of the war and the breaking down of class barriers, this goal has formed a strong Australian front. Due to the enthusiastic enlistment of Australians, age restrictions have become necessary. The purpose of this restriction is not only to limit the number of personnel, but also to make people realize that war is a matter for young people. Many veterans who retired from the European War have re-enlisted, even though the pay they receive is still the same as it was during the European War. Their purpose in enlisting is solely for war. He also said that the current training is completely different from that in Australia, and must include training in woodland and open wilderness operations. He believes that in a few weeks, they will be able to cope with any emergency. He also said that the Australians have prepared all their necessities, sufficient for many months of use, and that Australia can supply everything the army needs, such as light and heavy trucks, various munitions, etc., some of which are currently being shipped to the United Kingdom. (22nd Dispatch from the Associated Press)

New York: War clouds loom over Singapore, with signs of a storm on the horizon. Will Japan seize Singapore by force? If so, will they launch an attack immediately? This serious question worries the whole world. According to military experts here, if Singapore falls, the Malay Federation and the Dutch and British East Indies will likely fall within one or two months, and the gateways to Australia, New Zealand, and India will be wide open. It is doubtful whether Japan has the ability to advance this campaign. Only the highest Japanese warlords know how long Japan's accumulated military supplies can last compared to the aircraft, warships, and manpower concentrated by Britain in the Far East. Britain's dispatch of elite Australian troops to strengthen the defenses of Malaya proves the difficulty of attacking Singapore. Japan is fully aware of this. It is known here that the British and American governments recognize this action as a reconnaissance balloon to test Japan's reaction. If Japan is preparing to advance south, then Britain's actions will give Japan the opportunity to create another "incident." Japan has not done so. Its leaders deliberately avoid mentioning the British reinforcements in Singapore. Observers here believe that this attitude of Japan's, at least, leads people to infer that although the war clouds over Singapore are dense, the storm may not come immediately. (22nd Dispatch from International News Service)

### Japanese Mediation of European War Strategy Arouses German Dissatisfaction

Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's strategy of mediating the European war has aroused Germany's resentment. The German Ambassador to Japan recently sent a note to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. People here believe that Germany must think that Japan's measures have been inappropriate and that Germany must have hoped that Japan would handle the situation properly to achieve results.

Editorial

### Opium and Gambling in the Occupied Areas

If you ask people from the various occupied areas, what is the general social situation like? Opium dens are everywhere, and gambling houses are luxurious. This is the common answer, as it is the case everywhere. This is what Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek recently denounced as the internal enemies of the nation when he broadcast to the nation on the eve of the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement. On New Year's Day this year, when Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek wrote an inscription for the Shen Bao, urging readers to abandon a life of ease and poisonous pleasure, opium and gambling were also the main focus.

There are some common things in general society. Due to the difference in beliefs between those who act and those who criticize, judgments of right and wrong often differ. However, if the objective result shows that the harm is obvious, then this behavior is an unforgivable sin. Opium and gambling are originally sinful behaviors that no one is willing to forgive. It can almost be said that there is little controversy about this both in ancient and modern times, and at home and abroad. There are those who establish a country based on opium and gambling, using financial reasons, historical reasons, or various other reasons as explanations for allowing opium and gambling. However, no one has cited moral viewpoints as defenses for opium and gambling not being sinful. Opium and gambling are strictly prohibited in free China, but are openly rampant in the occupied areas under the protection of evil forces. This cannot be seen as whether or not opium and gambling are sinful, and there are different moral standards in these two worlds. It is sinful in free China, but not sinful in the occupied areas. But it is precisely enough to prove that the laws and regulations of free China and the so-called "laws and regulations" of the occupied areas are absolutely not comparable. One side is where laws and regulations are in harmony with morality, while the other side disregards morality and fundamentally violates morality. Then, are the people in the occupied areas who are addicted to opium and gambling only too happy to flock to it because the power of the Chinese government's laws and regulations is beyond their reach, and do they not know how to restrain themselves? How regrettable and lamentable!

There are also quite a few sins in general society, the motives of which are extremely pitiful. For example, the sin of opium and gambling, those who are addicted to it, have their own common reasons for being addicted to sin. Everyone can know it, everyone can talk about it, there is no need to list them in detail, and they are not worth pitying. However, one occasionally hears of exceptions, which are heartbreaking. There are people trapped in the occupied areas whose hearts ache from the great national disaster, and who witness the rampant actions of wolves and jackals. Everywhere is wrong, and nothing is right. Over the years, they have become decadent. What they yearn for is the restoration of the country and the return of the sun, so that they can be free from their addictions and start anew with everyone. It is believable that there are many people like this. Analyzing the origin of sin, there are those who, due to extremely pitiful stimuli, abandon themselves, compared to those who mislead themselves, harm the country, and act perversely, right and wrong cannot be mentioned on the same day. However, indulging in opium and gambling is still not forgiven for being a sin, regardless of how pitiful the motives and circumstances are. Because, in addition to harming oneself, opium and gambling are both the implementation of a poisoning policy and the implementation of a war-sustaining policy. And the people in the occupied areas who are addicted to opium and gambling, whether due to common sinful reasons or pitiful impulses, since the objective result of opium and gambling is to accept its policies, that is, to help promote its policies' achievements and gains, then is there any room for forgiving the definite sin? Moreover, the so-called "everywhere is wrong, and nothing is right" is often a kind of prejudice. Of course, this is absolutely not to say that patriotism is a prejudice, and loyalty is a prejudice. It is absolutely not to say that it is okay to abandon these kinds of prejudices and go with the flow, doing anything and everything. We deeply believe that those who aspire to be accomplished and have the ability to be accomplished will be able to be accomplished under any circumstances. Struggling against the adversities of circumstances is a noble spirit and a noble duty. Finding ways to overcome adverse circumstances is a capable talent. Those who think of accomplishing something often give up because they feel that they are insufficient in various ways. Generally, what they feel most insufficient is financial resources. In fact, there are many undertakings that do not require much affluent power. For example, social undertakings, serving the society, are often thought to be impossible without financial resources. In reality, is this really the case? One can accomplish something even with bare hands. Why worry about not having the ability, but worry about not having the ambition. Those who are addicted to opium and gambling and feel ashamed of their inability are deceiving themselves. There are too many ways and too many opportunities to contribute to society and the nation for those who do not go with the flow in the occupied areas!

### Sino-American Cultural Association Hosts Currie and Johnson; Currie Will Soon Pass Through Hong Kong to Return to the United States

Chongqing: Dr. Currie, the administrative assistant to Roosevelt who came to China to collect economic data, told an Associated Press reporter today that he will go to Hong Kong in a few days to take the next clipper ship back to the United States. He said that he found the work of studying economic problems here very interesting, but that if there were not so many banquets, he would be able to do more research. When the reporter asked him how many times he had met with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, he replied, "Only a few times." The Sino-American Cultural Association and the Chongqing Harvard University Alumni Association jointly held a Washington's Birthday tea party, hosting Currie and Ambassador Johnson. Dr. Currie praised the morale of the Chinese people, saying, "I feel that the Chinese Air Force is defending the democratic outpost in this global war. I am very clear about the responsibility and mission of the United States in this war. I hope the United States will not disappoint you." At this point, the 300 Chinese officials and Americans present applauded enthusiastically. Ambassador Johnson pointed out that there was a portrait of Washington hanging on the wall, facing a portrait of Confucius, and between the two was a map of the American Pacific and East Asia. The slogan "Peace" was on the Washington portrait. Johnson joked that Confucius and Washington in the portraits both carried weapons, but Washington's sword was smaller. He hoped that the sword could soon become larger. He also hoped that if China and the United States could truly cooperate, it might contribute to world peace, which now seemed to have been abandoned in the Arctic. American Ambassador Johnson, about to leave Chongqing, expressed his extreme regret. Finance Minister Kung immediately stopped him and said, "You must return." Johnson said, "This is what I want. No matter where I go, I will never forget China in my heart." Minister Kung then said, "If there is no peace in the Pacific, then there will be no peace in the Atlantic. The way to lead the Pacific to peace is through close cooperation between China and the United States." Kung also mentioned the progress of Sino-American transportation, saying that Sino-American transportation has evolved from sailing ships to clipper planes. Kung predicted that in the near future, a means of transportation will be invented that will shorten the travel time between Washington and Chongqing to within two days. Mr. Currie, in his extreme praise of China's morale, said that he had enjoyed a lot during this short stay and was determined to bring his family to China on his next visit. This American economic expert also said that Sino-American ideas coincided with each other, which impressed him deeply. He also said that he was equally impressed by the Chinese leaders' application of broad democracy to the Chinese people. Currie also emphasized the importance of judicial equality and civil liberties, saying that China was progressing towards these things in all aspects. (22nd Dispatch from the Associated Press)

The preparatory committee has also established a legal research committee for the Journalists Association to study the results and solicit opinions from colleagues in various places to propose the organization of a national Journalists Association at the inaugural meeting. (22nd Dispatch)

### Commemorating the Seventh Anniversary of the New Life Movement - Chairman Chiang’s Radio Address

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) The four points mentioned above are particularly important tasks in promoting the New Life Movement in the future. In addition, we must adhere to the spirit of labor service advocated in the past, encourage each other to be diligent, and promote production. As far as the most urgent needs are concerned, we must encourage compatriots in various places to work hard in

post station transportation to supplement the inadequacy of mechanical transportation. Recently, the Director of the Women’s Guidance Association is advocating that female compatriots go to the fields to cultivate and increase our agricultural production to supplement rural labor. We must also promote air raid services and strengthen fire protection and relief in this work to train ordinary compatriots in mutual love and assistance, to guard their posts, maintain order, and to develop brave and alert skills and spirit. In short, the rear should exert effort and sweat, and the front should fight bravely. They should be equally tense and equally loyal. The front and rear should cooperate consistently. This can not only create a glorious victory but also cultivate a new atmosphere of striving, vigorousness, and active labor in the battle, laying a good and solid foundation for our arduous nation-building work. This is the urgent task of our New Life Movement at present, and it is also the responsibility that every compatriot should shoulder in the fifth year of the war to the end. Regarding this year's

important points for the promotion of the New Life Movement, I have already explained them in general terms. Now I would like to add a few words. The outline of the New Life Movement originally stipulated that there should be a central organization responsible for its implementation. Since its implementation, some have been implemented according to regulations, but there are also many who only focus on formalities, routine stories, and even falsely report implementation. Now, we must pay attention to the responsible personnel in various places. From now on, they must continue their efforts, seek truth from facts, and be responsible for the implementation of the New Life Movement. It is hoped that teachers and students at all levels of schools will, in the spirit of "enlightening others after being enlightened," take responsibility in the areas near the schools and create systematic and organized long-term plans. For example, each teacher or student should designate several families or Baojia as the target of their service and guidance and earnestly advocate to the people. Now that most universities and middle schools are dispersed in the countryside, it is the best opportunity to be close to the people.

Assisting the people in promoting the New Life Movement is the most meaningful work for teachers and young students to serve society. The New Life Movement is also a kind of social education movement. Finally, I would like to mention to everyone that the Japanese have made many slanders against our country. In the past, they often denounced us as "inferior people," as "disorderly and selfish," as "pervaded by indiscipline," and even ridiculed our people for having no national concept, no national consciousness, and not being a true modern country. Now, thanks to our strong fighting, we have given them a factual rebuttal. However, military success must be matched by the progress of the entire society. We must be vigilant and ashamed of these remarks made by the Japanese who despise us and reflect on ourselves whether there are still remnants of this kind of root cause, and strive to correct them and wash away the shame. We remember that many people have said that the root cause of our country's problems lies in "poverty," "ignorance," "selfishness," and "weakness." In fact, our country is not poor, the people are not ignorant, and we are not born "selfish" or "weak." People should know that

poverty is due to extravagance, ignorance is due to mountains and laziness, selfishness is due to lack of integrity, and weakness is due to lack of self-improvement. If all compatriots in the country can implement the items of the New Life Movement, these four root causes will be difficult to eliminate. The words I mentioned above, "It is easy to remove thieves from the mountains, but difficult to remove thieves from the heart," in fact, "removing thieves from the mountains" is indeed easy, and "removing thieves from the heart" is also easy. As long as I have ambition, determination, and the ability to be self-aware and self-reliant, I can completely transform myself with a single thought. And we must all be able to honestly implement the New Life Movement. I firmly believe that in the shortest possible time, we will be able to transform the entire society and our entire country. We must thoroughly understand the essence of the New Life Movement and strive to practice

the true spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, without hypocrisy, without perfunctoriness, and without giving up halfway. There must be a beginning and an end. In the world, all results of doing things with hypocrisy and pretense will end in failure. If we want to complete the revolution, we must be honest. If we want to implement the New Life Movement, if you are not true and not real, then nothing can be successful and there will be no failure. How can we revive the nation and change society? Know that having fought to this day, our victory is inevitable. The more important task is to reform our society and all the bad habits of individuals, to create a new atmosphere for our nation and people, and to universally create the social conditions for wartime victory and successful nation-building. We can prove from history that the creation of a new era of politics must first have the work of removing bad habits and changing customs. At the same time, we believe that our New Life Movement is actually the work of removing the old and bringing forth the new and changing customs, so we especially hope that intellectuals and leaders from all walks of life will

take the lead and take responsibility to make the New Life Movement a new atmosphere for the whole country. Now we all recognize the importance of meaning, but such simple recognition is not enough. It must be profound and widespread. All our compatriots, regardless of men, women, old, and young, must truly understand the meaning of the New Life Movement and honestly implement the New Life Movement without any pretense or hypocrisy. Only then can the war achieve true victory, and only then can nation-building be truly successful. Only in this way can we use the New Life Movement to promote our great cause of war and promote the realization of a new China of the Three Principles of the People, independence, and freedom. I sincerely hope that compatriots across the country will work hard for the New Life Movement and open up a bright future for our nation. My speech is over. I wish all our compatriots good health and victory in the war! (18th) (End)

### British Military and Diplomacy Go Hand in Hand, European War to Unfold a New Situation, Eden Visits Near East to Review Future Strategy and Seek to Enhance Cooperation between Britain and Turkey

Istanbul Reliable sources say that after British Foreign Secretary Eden finishes his visit to Egypt, he will go to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to discuss matters with the Turkish government. (United Press, 22nd)

Cairo British Foreign Secretary Eden, who arrived here on Thursday with British Imperial General Staff Chief General Dill, has been discussing military affairs with military leaders and has also met with General Catroux, commander of the Free French forces in the Near East. Eden may also visit some areas within British-occupied Cyrenaica before departing elsewhere. (Reuters, 22nd)

Basel A report here quotes a Hungarian dispatch saying that the news of British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Imperial General Staff Chief General Dill's arrival in Egypt has attracted great attention in the Balkans. Everyone clearly remembers the events that occurred after Eden's last visit to Cairo, it said. (Reuters, 22nd)

London "The Times" today commented on British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Imperial General Staff Chief General Dill's current arrival in Cairo, saying that Britain is now using diplomatic weapons as it has applied them to support the army. The British government's foresight is evident here. The nerve center of today's complex overall problem seems to be in the Balkans, and the right path to deal with this problem is actually related to the British military headquarters in Cairo. In numerous talks over the past month, British-Turkish cooperation has been fully maintained. Eden's visit to the Near East will definitely make this cooperation even stronger. The crisis of nerve warfare seems imminent, but firmness can guarantee a safe victory in this crisis. The most urgent task for Britain is to strengthen effective assistance to Greece and make Greek defenses an impregnable fortress. Turkey's cooperation in this regard will definitely increase the certainty of success in assisting Greece and prevent the war from spreading to Turkey's borders. Hitler is indeed a master at crushing those who are ambiguous, but he is unwilling to easily challenge resolute and well-prepared defenses. The victory in Africa has raised administrative issues, which are also closely related to the duties of Foreign Secretary Eden. These issues must be dealt with as a whole. Britain must also make it clear to the world that the temporary administration currently needed in the liberated areas does not hinder their future status, because Britain has absolutely no territorial ambitions. It is only exercising the rights of a conquering country to protect the area and will eventually restore its status in a new order that can improve the happiness of its people and give the people the satisfaction they need. (Reuters, 22nd)

Vichy Diplomatic circles here recently commented on the British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to Egypt, saying that due to the great victory of the British army in Libya and the recent turmoil in the Balkans, a new situation has emerged in the Eastern Mediterranean. Eden's visit is probably to review this recent new situation. Since British and Greek troops launched offensives in Libya and Albania respectively, although both sides have achieved victories, it is necessary to carefully study how to continue and expand these offensives in the future. On the one hand, the timing of Germany's direct attack on the British Isles seems to be approaching day by day. On the other hand, Britain has recently transferred significant forces to the Far East to strengthen its defenses in Singapore, Burma, and Malaya. Therefore, it must carefully assess the situation and re-examine its operational plans in the Eastern Mediterranean. However, British public opinion believes that it is undoubtedly necessary to maintain a stronghold in Southeastern Europe. In summary, Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to Egypt will have a significant impact on Britain's future operational plans in the Near East and the Balkans. (Havas, 22nd)

### Britain Announces Laying Mines in Entire Central Mediterranean Region

London The Admiralty announced that the Italian government had recently declared a large area in the central Mediterranean dangerous for navigation. The British government now also announces that the following Mediterranean areas are quite dangerous for navigating ships, with the following locations: From Cape Santa Maria di Leuca in Italian territory to Benghazi, westward along the African coast to the border between Tunisia and Tripoli, along the French territorial waters to a point three miles north of Cape Bon, then from there to a point thirty miles from Cape Spartivento in Sardinia, then along the Sardinian coast to parallel 41, then east to Cape Planka, and finally south along the Italian coast and east to Cape Santa Maria di Leuca. The previous notices issued to ships navigating within thirty miles of the Italian coast in the Mediterranean, assuming responsibility for their own risks, remain in effect. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Axis Powers Declare Launch of Large-Scale Submarine Warfare Against Britain, Encircling British Isles into a Dead Ring

Rome Yesterday, the Roman "Popolo di Roma" stated that the Axis powers will launch a submarine attack unprecedented in history. Britain has two hundred and seventy-five destroyers to defend itself against the Axis, but Italy has the most submarines in the world and is still constantly producing them. Submarine warfare will be the fiercest battle since spring. Of Britain's two hundred and seventy-five destroyers, seventy must be left in the Mediterranean to protect the British fleet concentrated there. The remaining two hundred and ten or so protect British ships and British territorial waters, so only slightly less than 50% are used to attack submarines in the war. Germany had only fifty submarines when the war began, but since last June, Western European and French ports have been managed by Germany, and Britain is isolated. Italy had one hundred and twenty-one submarines when it joined the war, and has only lost eleven so far. With Italy's massive production, it will soon be able to create the most powerful submarine force in the world. What we want to say now is that the world's fiercest or unimaginable large-scale submarine battle is about to occur, and Britain is the biggest target of the attack. (United Press, 22nd)

Berlin The semi-official "German Gazette" recently published an article explaining the contents of the so-called "Berlin Strategic Plan." The article stated briefly that Germany can force Britain to surrender by using submarines and air force operations. Germany's operational plan can be roughly divided into three major parts: (1) Using submarine warfare combined with the strength of a strong naval air force to encircle the British Isles into a dead ring, making it impossible for Britain to break through. Regarding this matter, it is worth noting that the merchant ships of Britain and its allies lost as much as 195,000 tons in the two weeks from the 1st to the 20th of this month, but only 79,500 tons of them were sunk by submarines, because until now, German submarines have not been fully deployed, and most of the personnel are preparing for a large-scale offensive this spring. (2) Using a large number of aircraft to concentrate on bombing British industrial centers and destroy the convenience of transportation on the British Isles. The continuous bombing of British industrial cities will completely shut down the country's munitions industry. (3) No matter what efforts Britain makes in the future to solve the Mediterranean problem, it will only facilitate Germany's attack on the British mainland. The reason is that if Britain wants to achieve a major victory on the Mediterranean coast, it must send troops to Africa, which will disperse the strength of the defense forces in the mainland. It is not known that if German troops land on the British Isles, this army will be of great importance to the defense of Britain. As far as the landing problem is concerned, since there are many places on the British coast where German troops can land, the defense forces will suffer from not knowing where the main force of the German army is. At that time, if the German army only occupies a fortress in British territory, it will be enough to determine the fate of the war, because every inch of land occupied by the German army can be used as a "bridgehead" for continued advancement.

### Large Numbers of American Military Aircraft Have Indeed Flown to the Far East, Including 200 Bombers, Another 70 Shipped to China

New York The New York Tribune reported yesterday that the US Navy Department and the British Purchasing Mission have confirmed that American military aircraft have been transported to the Far East. Among them, Lockheed and Consolidated aircraft are flying to Singapore, and 70 Curtiss fighter planes are being shipped to China. Also, twelve former US Navy pilots have been sent to the Dutch East Indies to serve as instructors. Among these aircraft are 200 bombers, which were originally intended for British use but are now being transported to the Far East through various channels. (United Press, 22nd)

Washington Recent reports say that many American Consolidated and Lockheed bombers have flown from San Diego, USA, to Singapore, stopping at various American islands along the way. The British Embassy announced today that it is sufficient to confirm this news. However, according to aviation experts, although the Consolidated bomber can fly long distances, it is doubtful that the Lockheed bomber can travel together. (Havas, 21st)

Washington The British government has purchased a large number of aircraft from the United States, which have been transported to the Far East. Most of them are four-engine Boeing bombers with a range of 6,000 miles. (Havas, 21st)

Honolulu Thirty-one P-36 fighter planes were transported here yesterday from the United States by the aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and landed at Wheeler Field Army Air Base. This is the largest increase in the number of aircraft for the Hawaiian Air Force. At dawn, the "Enterprise" sailed to a point fifteen miles outside Pearl Harbor, and then the planes flew directly to Wheeler Field Airfield in teams of three. When flying over Honolulu, no one paid attention because the planes stationed there were always making regular flights. These planes will join the expanding 18th Fighter Squadron. (United Press, 22nd)

### Japan Denies Signing Economic Treaty with Soviet Union

Tokyo Official sources here today denied reports that the Soviet Union and Japan had signed an economic treaty. It is heard that this news was broadcast by a radio station in Saigon. The radio station apparently misunderstood the announcement issued by the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau on Thursday that Soviet-Japanese trade negotiations had reopened. The Information Bureau said that the reopening of the negotiations was in accordance with the agreement established by Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Tatekawa and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. (United Press, 22nd)

### US to Strictly Control Uses of Nickel, Aluminum, and Zinc, Sir Frederick Whyte Suggests Economic Blockade Against Japan

Washington Defense authorities predicted yesterday that the government will soon strictly enforce controls on nickel, aluminum, and zinc, prohibiting their misuse except for defense-related purposes. Defense Committee member Stettinius appealed to people not involved in defense to use other alternatives. (United Press, 22nd)

London Sir Frederick Whyte, former political advisor to the Chinese government and General Secretary of the English-Speaking Union, yesterday called for Britain and the United States to impose an economic blockade against Japan to prevent Japan from joining the war and supporting its Axis allies. Whyte said that President Roosevelt's strong stance and the actions taken by Britain and Australia have somewhat eased the situation in the Far East, but the crisis has not yet passed. Hitler does not care what Japan does or how it does it. He only needs Japan to increase its ambitions in Europe. Japan has been engaged in wars of various scopes for nine and a half years. He does not overestimate the degree of depletion of Japan's resources, but Japan may underestimate the danger of its necessary supplies being cut off. Therefore, an economic blockade can curb Japan without costing a single bullet. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Germany Tries to Promote Italian-Greek Reconciliation, Content of Alleged Peace Terms

Yugoslav Capital Yesterday, well-informed sources reported, but not officially confirmed, that Germany had proposed peace terms to Greece, which Italy agreed to sign. The contents were: (1) Italy withdraws its demand for military bases in Greece; (2) Italy demands an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Greek troops from Albania; (3) The Italian-Greek border is determined according to the draft drawn up in Florence on December 17, 1913. (United Press, 22nd)

### Under Pretense of Assisting in Disaster Relief, Germany Plans to Send Troops to Spain, Aiming to Use Santander Port as Submarine Base for Attacking Britain

Madrid Five hundred German troops, including technicians and soldiers, were originally scheduled to arrive in the city of Santander, recently destroyed by wind and fire, at sunset yesterday to participate in relief work, but as of late last night, no news had been received here that the German troops had arrived in the border town of Irún. News from Santander said that in addition to being willing to clear rubble, the German troops are unwilling to help repair traffic and power lines and set up open-air dining halls to provide hot food to refugees. It is reported that a German liaison officer has arrived in Santander to make preparations. Those who will arrive here include an engineering team and a hospital with full medical personnel and ambulances, as well as a catering department and food supplies, etc. Madrid officials announced last night that the announcement of German troops coming to Spain to help was made too early, which may cause the government to politely decline German assistance. (United Press, 22nd)

London London still has no confirmed news about reports that some German troops have crossed the French border into Spain at the invitation of the Spanish Foreign Minister to assist in disaster relief and medical affairs in Santander. (Reuters, 22nd)

Madrid Official news, German "relief" teams will enter the city of Santander (a good port in northern Spain) in a few hours, which has experienced great wind and fire disasters. This matter was proposed by the German Ambassador to Spain Stohrer and approved by Spanish Interior Minister Suñer. German liaison officers are already arranging for the entry of German troops into Santander. (London considers the fact that Suñer allowed the German "relief troops" to enter Spain to be a dangerous example. Germany is obviously using humanitarian excuses to take the first step in penetrating Spain. Although commentators believe that German troops may not attack Gibraltar from Santander, the port is good and very suitable for the use of submarines). (United Press, 22nd)

### Reports of German Troops Entering Bulgaria from Romania Await Confirmation, Danube Bridge-Building Project Not Easy, Turkey's Attitude Highly Noteworthy

London Rumors of alarming developments in the Balkans persist here, including reports that German troops have crossed the border into Bulgaria from Romania. (Reuters, 22nd)

London Reuters diplomatic sources claim that well-informed sources here have not confirmed reports of German troops entering Bulgaria, but German actions in Bulgaria are showing signs of soon changing from covert to overt, such as the reduction in railway traffic across the Bulgarian border in the past two days, preparations for bridge-building in various parts of the Danube, and the requisitioning of houses in various important locations for the residence of German staff officers. Currently, however, no German troops in uniform have appeared in Bulgaria, and Bulgaria still maintains its nominal independence, so there is no need for the British ambassador to leave. (Reuters, 22nd)

London Although the German side is taking strict precautions to conceal its actions, it is not easy to obtain accurate information. However, reports that the Germans are building bridges or pontoon bridges on the Danube seem unlikely, as the river is piled high with ice floes, and the average width of the Danube River between Romania and Bulgaria is about one mile. It is impossible for the German side to build these bridges in a few hours. (Reuters, 22nd)

Istanbul While rumors are circulating that German troops have quietly entered Bulgaria and cannot be confirmed, knowledgeable sources here indicated last night that even though a Turkish-Bulgarian agreement has been signed, Turkey may take action to prevent Germany from striking Greece. At the same time, it is said that British Foreign Secretary Eden may come to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to discuss with Turkish leaders Nazi military strategy in the Balkans. Qualified sources here said that the British army is now preparing to meet the forward troops of the German army that will attack Thessaloniki via Bulgaria. Regarding this point, because it is rumored that the British army is currently being transported from North Africa to Greece, this rumor cannot be confirmed. Yesterday, rumors were rife here that German troops had secretly concentrated in Bulgaria, but officials could not confirm it. It is rumored that if German military action is taken, it will be used to attack Greece. It is believed that Eden's visit to the Turkish capital is a further step in British-Turkish relations, especially in dealing with Germany's threat in the Balkans. Turkey, with the support of Britain, believes that its borders will be under German control, so it may take action or even fight Germany if Germany attacks Greece. (International News, 22nd)

### Italy's Demands on France to Use North African Ports Rejected by General Pétain

London A message received here said that Italy's request to use ports in French Africa for the escape of the remaining Italian troops in Libya has been rejected by French leader General Pétain. (Reuters, 22nd)

### International Anecdotes (6): Impressions of the Four Greats of Europe and America

In order to portray Stalin, to show the extent to which he is misunderstood, and the position he occupies among the rulers of the world, I consulted a friend who is a diplomat. He is an extremely astute observer, especially when it comes to studying human character, in which he has a very strong interest. He has met and talked with dictators from various countries around the world, and has no particular reason to be fond of any of them. Regarding Stalin, he said:

"Of the three dictators, he is the most humane. He is the only one among the three who laughs heartily. In my several meetings with Hitler and Mussolini, I saw nothing more than a thin smile on their lips. But Stalin can laugh, and laugh heartily. Of the three dictators, Stalin is the senior. I don't mean he is the oldest, although in terms of age, he is certainly the eldest. But he is also the strongest and most robust. What I mean is that in terms of race, he is the oldest, he comes from one of the oldest races, the Asians.

"Stalin is the most sincere and straightforward, with no pretense of being clever or putting on airs. Mussolini, in front of an audience, is like a street performer, often showing off his great strength. Mussolini also has the precision and logic of a Latin. All his actions and plans are logical—but his logic is not without errors.

"On the other hand, Hitler is entirely driven by instinct—like an animal. He is very effeminate, deeply believes in intuition, and it is impossible to discuss any issue with him. If he is willing to listen to you, then he listens leisurely, even putting on a flattering demeanor, a tone that is somewhat obsequious, which, in my opinion, is not moving at all. But at the slightest word of anger, his personality completely changes. His eyes roll back, his hands tremble, and his face turns blue. He argues terribly, like a hysterical woman.

"But Stalin is a person. He is not cruel. This is just a Western perception. He always maintains the Asian mean in the face of suffering. The Chinese are an extremely civilized nation, but they are not alarmed when they see heads stuck on spearheads. Asians have a different view of life than we do. Stalin is also like this, not cruel.

"He doesn't think of himself as a hero, a god, or a savior. He finds it amusing how people display his portraits and shrugs his shoulders when he sees those hero-worshiping gestures. He says, 'Everyone likes it that way, especially in Soviet Russia.' He has a wealth of experience in the ways of his predecessors and is very forward-thinking. He is cautious in his actions and knows that he has the ability to endure. He is fundamentally a pragmatist, not an idealist.

"Among the dictators, he is the most astute. He has a self-awareness like an animal's sense of smell, and a very logical intelligence. His policies always rely on these two in tandem. He is not like Hitler, who portrays himself as a sleepwalker, nor like Mussolini, who is meticulous in his assessment of factors. He thinks while also relying on his premonitions to act.

"Stalin is the most normal of the three, but if measured by Western standards, he is not 'normal.' He is an ordinary person from Central Asia. Westerners cannot understand him. As one of the people, he is the most approachable of all the dictators. He is the only one among them who makes me feel that he has supreme wisdom."

Roosevelt, like Stalin, Churchill, and Hitler, is a lucky man. But Americans, even those who support and are fervently loyal to him, do not know Roosevelt's essence, and the position he occupies in this world of strife. Because Americans do not look at him through the eyes of European sufferers, they do not know Roosevelt's significance. In Hitler's eyes, Roosevelt and Churchill are the two most hateful people in the world. His resentment towards them is not entirely due to political reasons, nor is the reason immediately clear.

He hates them both because they are aristocrats; he hates them because they do not heed his teachings. Churchill, in particular, publicly called him a ridiculous madman; he hates them both because the minorities they represent are the very ones he wants to conquer and control! In terms of pure Nordic race, the British Prime Minister and the American President are the representatives. Students of ethnology know deeply that Hitler has an inexplicable hatred for the Nordic race. Norway and the Netherlands were conquered by the Germans, but they did not succumb. The Dutch navy is still fighting.

Hitler's catchphrase is "superman," and by "superman" he means Germans. But Churchill directly pointed out his delusion. If the world has recently seen supermen, it refers to those who fought at Dunkirk. They are all ordinary Englishmen—sailors, fishermen, and civilians.

The true meaning of Roosevelt is reflected on one hand in the resentment in Hitler's mind, and on the other hand in the praise reflected by ordinary Europeans. British children, kneeling in churches that may be bombed by German planes tomorrow, pray, "God, please bless Mr. Roosevelt." This is the truth.

Millions upon millions of people in Europe deeply believe in their hearts that there is one person in the world who can save them from suffering and lead them to peace and freedom. That person's name is Roosevelt. They see him as a man who laughs kindly and hates all kinds of oppression. Because he has suffered himself, he can understand the suffering of others, and as someone who has been there, he can practice the great ambition of overcoming disaster.

They see Roosevelt as a person who can change the character of a nation that believes in freedom and humanitarianism. They hope that he and his country can perform a miracle in any way possible. They truly hope that America can stop Hitler and the war and obtain a bright future for ordinary people.

Bloodshed and pain cannot obtain mysterious good fortune. Now there is only one magician left—a leader with magical power, and a mysterious island: that is President Roosevelt and the United States. (The End)

### Rice Weevils Control the Rice Market; Neither Opening Up as Required Nor Considering Rice Congestion; Instead, They Are Going After Japonica Rice, Glutinous Rice, and Original Packaging of Foreign Brands Like British-Chinese Company Rice

The rice market is meant to circulate rice and regulate people's food supply. However, today's rice market is doing the opposite, becoming a grand stage for speculators. They either raise rice prices or hoard it and refuse to sell, making it impossible to buy. As a result, people are becoming more panicked. The rice market has been like a dead market for days. Yesterday, it was still in this state. Moreover, because those who own physical goods are wary of strict price limits and unwilling to open up as required, a situation of market with no goods has been created. Only New Saigon of Jinshichang No. 1 and small rice grains of the sub-grade Tokyo and Jianzhongguan, and crushed rice of No. 3, were opened slightly. Otherwise, they were completely absent. If such a bad phenomenon is allowed to continue, what can be said about the future of people's food supply? The rice weevils only know how to seek their own selfish interests and fill their bellies, leaving the Shanghai people to starve. There is no good solution other than cracking down on hoarding and ordering the release of goods. The rice weevils have not stopped their evil deeds. With physical goods already reaching the price limit, speculators have shifted their attention to the original packaging of British-Chinese Company rice. Therefore, yesterday's futures trading was particularly active, with no less than 3,000 tons traded in the morning and afternoon. On the market, No. 1 Saigon for immediate delivery was sold at 99.5 yuan to 99 yuan; crushed rice for February was 80 yuan; crushed rice for February and March was 79 yuan; small rice grains for immediate delivery were 93 yuan, 92 yuan for February, and 89.3 yuan to 90 yuan; small rice grains for March and April were 91.5 yuan, showing a hidden increase of more than 1 yuan compared to the day before. New trading was not concluded due to unsettled ships and the Saturday afternoon holiday. However, pricing has been agreed, and there may be further agreements next week.

Foreign rice is arriving one after another. Jardine Matheson's Risen Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 4,924 bags of foreign rice and 2,710 bags of corn from Hong Kong, and docked at the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. Another 2,694 bags of corn are scheduled to be shipped to Yantai on the same ship tomorrow. Swire's Jiaying Wheel also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 8,300 bags of foreign rice from Siam. It is reported that the Zhazhawayou (transliteration) ship of the Java Mailboat Company arrived yesterday afternoon, also carrying a large batch of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Due to yesterday being a Saturday afternoon holiday, the exact number of foreign rice on the ship is unknown and will be reported tomorrow. (Zu)

Due to inconvenient transportation, not much thick japonica rice and other domestic rice has arrived. Due to the high prices of foreign rice, there are also opportunities to hoard domestic rice. The owners' prices are rising randomly. The prices of both thick and thin japonica rice have soared by 2-3 yuan. Kunshan original white japonica rice has reached 110 yuan, with the price of husked rice at 105 yuan, 104 yuan, and as high as 106 yuan. Qingjiao thin rice husked rice is priced at 102 yuan to 101 yuan, original packaging is especially 107.8 yuan, and the secondary packaging is 106.5 yuan.

Glutinous rice is in a different environment from other goods, and it is an exception to the price limit. General big players have focused their attention on it. As a result, sales are also declining, and prices have generally risen by 1-2 yuan. Hong Kong special yuan rice has opened at 86.5 yuan and 86 yuan, ordinary rice is 84-85 yuan, and glutinous tea is 77-78 yuan.

### A Large Batch of Goods from Other Provinces Will Arrive; Flour Market Declines

Flour: Yesterday, the flour market gradually became softer. A large batch of flour from other provinces and foreign flour will arrive soon. Foreign firms have telegraphed that there are no obstacles for foreign flour ships. Small batches of flour transshipped from Hong Kong have also arrived, such as Blue Mark Battleship and other brands. As a result, the market's buying sentiment has weakened. However, the state of the Huachang's cheap flour has not yet returned to normal. At present, the actual sales of foreign flour are still relatively good. The price of Bell Tower and Flower Bird brand Australian flour has dropped from 25.8 yuan to 7 yuan, and the price of Golden Dragon brand Kanfen flour is 24.6 yuan. Around 10,000 bags were traded, and the market has fallen by 1-2 jiao.

Wheat: Yesterday's market was even more secretly firm, due to frequent increases in domestic production prices. The price of Gao Du wheat (old scale) is 62 yuan per stone. The future source of supply is even scarcer. The foreign wheat ordered by Huachang has also been delayed. Therefore, people are generally optimistic about the price. It is heard that the daily factory price has been raised. Yesterday, there were more than 100 bags of factory goods near Benmai, with a factory price of 33.2 yuan. There is a market with no trading.

### Financial Foreign Exchange Turns Flat

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices without any rise or fall. The unofficial British and American exchange markets showed a flattening trend. There was nothing exciting happening today, and operators adopted a cautious attitude, with very little buying and selling activity, mainly due to the small transaction volume. After opening in the morning, the US dollar briefly rose to 5.6875 yuan due to sales by the Bank of Japan. However, Huahing Bank and the Bank of Communications absorbed the supply, so the rate quickly returned to 5.65625 yuan. At the noon close, the spot US dollar was at 3 453125, and the US dollar was at 5.65625 yuan, showing no gain or loss compared to the closing price of the previous day.

Bank of Japan Makes Initial Sales

Exchange rates for British against US and Shanghai were flat, with US against British up by a half cent, against Shanghai down by a small three cents, and no market for against French francs. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Bank's spot selling prices were 3 453125 for British gold and 5.65625 yuan for US dollars. After the opening, the Bank of Japan initially came in to sell, and the spot US dollar briefly showed slight hardening. It was estimated that Huahing Bank absorbed at 5.6875 yuan. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. There was no rise or fall in the silver equalization tax. Afterwards, the Bank of England and the Bank of Communications first sold this month's forward contracts to foreign banks at 3 453125. Subsequently, speculators sold slightly, but the market remained stable due to the willingness of the Bank of Communications to absorb the supply. The March rate was once made at 5.65625 yuan. The noon close returned to flat, with spot and this month's US dollar at 5.65625 yuan and British exchange at 3 453125. The next month's US dollar was quoted at 5.625 yuan and British exchange at 3 1275, all the same as the closing price of the day before yesterday. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Tianjin British and American All See Tightness

The "Joint Notes" unofficial market was expensive by 87 cents, to 79.75 yuan.

### Cinchona Tree (Continued)

— Gao Jiannong

Speaking of how the bitter bark of the cinchona tree became a universal medicine for saving the masses, it is truly thanks to the Jesuit priests: Because the natives of South America are usually so famously "naturally good at recognizing things," they showed extreme aversion to this bitter bark of the cinchona tree—the large ones were too bitter!—not to mention taking it as a medicine. Only the Jesuit priests, who were very attentive to the climate, products, customs, human relationships, and everything else in their missionary areas, could make the great discovery that "everything is for the greater glory of God"—the motto of their society!

After the Jesuit priests in Peru discovered the ability of the cinchona tree's bitter bark to create a new medicine, we can no longer know who was initially used as the test subject for the new drug. However, after Countess Cinchone, this "Jesuit priest's powder" also received the support of Pope Innocent X (1644-1655), and only then could it exert its power to eradicate addiction in Catholic countries. However, like any successful new invention in the world: this new drug also encountered countless fierce and systematic opposition and resistance, namely the attacks of those crude and stubborn doctors who were then called "kings of the medical world!" In 1679 AD, a politician and man of letters, the Archbishop of Paris, Retz, died at the hands of corrupt and conservative doctors. Originally, the Archbishop was a very famous great man at the time, and when he fell ill, of course, "famous doctors" were sought from all sides. It was these famous doctors who opposed him taking the cinchona medicine of an explorer named Tallbot, even though this medicine had already cured many crowned heads. At that time, the medicine was made by grinding the bark of the cinchona tree into a fine powder and mixing it with wine. Later, the famous French King Louis XIV bought the medicine with money and spread it widely, which shows that his knowledge far exceeded that of those quack doctors. (To be continued)

### Spot Gold Extraordinarily Sought After, 410 Yuan Higher Than Futures

Yesterday's gold market saw fluctuations in the unofficial market, initially falling and then rising. After breaking through the 6,100 yuan mark, it was reported to have rebounded. People from all sides were somewhat nervous. The reasons were: (1) Spot gold rose sharply, requiring a premium of over 400 yuan over futures for delivery; (2) No special international developments, and the atmosphere gradually eased; (3) Short positions that had profited during the week started to cover; (3) The US dollar eased and then returned to flat. Therefore, although gold shops were actively selling, the price once retreated to 6,050 yuan. Later, due to the buying momentum of Xinyuan, Dafeng, Xiangxingyong, Tongkangyong, and Hengji, the price rose strongly at noon, reaching 6,125 yuan. The final squeeze was only ten yuan. Half-day trading volume was over 10,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The swap from February to March futures saw sellers posting 45 yuan to buyers. Spot gold was initially sold by Chengji to Xianghe for 100 taels and to Defu for 100 taels, both at a premium of 360 yuan over the futures price. Later, gold shops continued to actively buy, and the price rose by 50 yuan. Xianghe again bought 40 taels from Yongcheng, at a premium of 410 yuan. Afterwards, there was demand but no supply at the above price, leading to a rise in jewelry gold by ten yuan, reaching 670 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.

Unofficial Market Squeezed Up Ten Yuan Yesterday

Since morning, due to the weak market sentiment and active selling, the price per bar (ten taels) was pressed down by 55 yuan. The market opened at 9:15, already falling to 6,070 yuan. Subsequently, it continued to fall to 6,060 yuan. Floating positions were covered, raising the price to 6,090 yuan. Rencheng and Yongchengji, two gold shops, and securities firms heavily sold, and with the US dollar at 5.6875 yuan for settlement, the price gradually fell to 6,050 yuan. Tongkangyong and Dafeng Xinyuan Bank helped to buy, and the market immediately rose to 6,088 yuan. Again, gold shops helped to sell, retreating to 6,055 yuan. Mingfeng, Shunyuan, and Xiangxingyong bought, and the selling momentum gradually weakened, with the price gradually rising to around 6,080 yuan. At 11:15, bullish news came, and Tongkangyong, Hengji, Xinyuan, etc., again competed to buy, and the rising trend suddenly sharpened, resulting in a jump out of 6,100 yuan, reaching 6,125 yuan. The Hengji Bank helped to sell, and the price dropped again to 6,095 yuan. Soon after, buying momentum rose again, raising it to 6,118 yuan. The closing price was 6,115 yuan, squeezed up by ten yuan. After the close, it retreated to 6,108 yuan. Based on the US dollar's March closing price of 5.625 for settlement, it was 6,191 yuan, a difference of 76 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 75 yuan in the first half of the day. There was no trading outside the market in the afternoon. The spot gold price of cash shops was 430 yuan higher than the unofficial market futures price, and the buying price was 60-70 yuan lower than this selling price. There was no market for spot gold.

Jewelry Gold Alone Rises Ten Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops was initially quoted at 660 yuan by Datongxing and Xinxingtong, and at 12:20, it rose by ten yuan to 670 yuan (buying back was reduced by 40 yuan), it was said.

### Gold Pound Alone Falls One Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a slightly softer unofficial market price. British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan each. British gold notes remained stable as before, and the market price stood flat. American gold notes hovered between 17.37 and 17.45 yuan, with the result similar to the previous day. The evening market remained at 17.45 yuan. Hong Kong notes slightly tended to be firmer. Japanese gold notes remained stable as before, and the evening market still stood at the original price of 1.74 yuan. Korean notes continued to rise, and the evening market was 1.37 yuan.

### Securities and Public Bonds Turn From Bullish to Bearish

Yesterday's public bond market saw a sudden stop in buying by the bullish side, and the bullish side gradually cleared out positions, which led to a decline. Xinhua, Hongda, and Lemao released their bullish positions, and Changchun, Dahua, Dechang, and Renchang followed suit. On the trading floor, only Lianhe, Wuhe, and Xie Kang were still actively buying. Others, such as Xinchang, Houda, Jufeng, and Yichang, had limited numbers. The market was shrouded in selling pressure, struggling to rise, showing a sluggish appearance. The trend was still difficult to establish. There were no significant changes in the environmental news, and although there were rumors, they could not be confirmed. The market price uniformly fell by a small one yuan to 1.8 yuan. There was trading in Class D rice. The total transaction volume was approximately one million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

In stock trading, 100 shares of Huashang Electric Power shares were traded at a price of 7.7 yuan.

London, 21st (Friday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' shares remained flat and sluggish. Bank shares showed slight fluctuations. The Mercantile Bank's shares rose by two shillings and six pence, to seven pounds seventeen shillings and six pence. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's shares registered in England fell by one pound, to seventy-three pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton Sales in Spring Stagnant, Yarn Prices Difficult to Rise, Cotton Mills' Demand Remains Sluggish

The yarn market, after a major drop, is currently in a state of rotation, but the trend is relatively stable. It needs to wait for environmental changes before there can be a major rise or fall. As for Hong Kong merchants, there have been no wholesale transactions during this spring sale, and due to difficult shipping, there is still a lack of development capacity. Therefore, although the bullish side is trying its best to support it, it cannot rise. In addition, the foreign exchange market is also in a state of hesitation, and the yarn market is even more hesitant. However, the foundation is more solid than before. There was no unofficial market in the afternoon due to Saturday. Today, 415 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Double Horse opened flat in the morning, but sellers were unusually enthusiastic. Due to the unfavorable atmosphere, floating positions were dumped. The opening price was 1,292 yuan, dropping directly to 1,271 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that foreign exchange was flat and gold had not changed much. Market prices all hovered between 1,275 yuan and 1,280 yuan, with no major changes. By the closing price, it was 1,281 yuan. The transaction statistics for the half-day totaled 4,350 bales. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 295 Ningbo 40

Colleagues 4,000 Statistics 4,250

The situation with spot cotton is slightly more active, but the trend is still in a state of flatness. In addition, foreign exchange is easing, and foreign firms are softening their prices, so the demand from factories is particularly sluggish. However, mutual buying and selling among colleagues is more active.

New York Cotton Market, initially rose due to buying from colleagues, and later fell back due to the closing of most bullish positions and sales by Southern merchants. As a result, the closing price was lower than the previous day's spot and near-term prices by six to seven pounds, while the distant-term prices rose by five to six pounds. The Indian cotton market was weak due to sales by European exporters. Yesterday, the forecast was lowered by two rupees.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading, the market situation was again firm, but transactions were limited to scattered sales among colleagues. If the current yarn market continues to be good in the coming week, then each factory may purchase as much as possible.

### Yitou Cotton Cloth Sales Progress in Guangdong

Factory Cloth - Yesterday's market trend was firm, due to the recent progress in current sales by Guangdong merchants, and people's sentiments turned upward as a result. White goods, fine cloth, and twill each rose by 50 cents to one yuan, and coarse cloth also rose by 25 cents. Bleached and dyed cloth rose by nearly one yuan. Approximately 600 pieces of various cloths were traded on the street. Merchants from Zhejiang and Fujian purchased more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, coarse and fine cloth, etc. Merchants from Guangdong and Hong Kong purchased more than 500 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, bleached and dyed cloth, poplin, etc. Merchants from Siam and Luzon purchased more than 100 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth. Merchants from the northern route of Yanjin purchased more than 100 pieces of poplin and colored cloth. There will be 320 pieces of cloth shipped to Hong Kong on the 23rd.

Dongbu - Initially fell and then rose, and the situation continued to rise. The morning closing price for white goods and Longtou fine cloth was 44.5 yuan for current warehouse receipts. Subsequently, due to the collection of medium-grade fine cloth by dye factories on the street, it gradually rose. The later market saw a rainbow ball trade at 44.5 yuan, so Longtou's shouting price was already above 45 yuan. Compared with the price of the previous day, each piece of fine cloth was raised by 50 to 70 cents each. Fine twill was stable, with no significant changes.

### Woolen Cloth Spring Sales Prosperous

Woolen fabrics and woolen cloth are currently in a period of strong sales. Business in Chinese and Western-style clothing is frequent. Light woolen fabrics needed for spring sales, light-colored light wool products, are all selling well. Guest merchants on the street have considerable transactions every day. In addition to woolen fabrics, there are also silk yarn woven products such as black carbon inch, French inch, pocket cloth, satin, soft inch, horse tail inch, fancy cloth, silk sleeve lining, sleeve lining silk, electric light satin, silk light feather yarn, and plain light feather yarn, which are also selling quite well. Their selling prices are related to the cost of raw materials, and 80-90% of them have risen to some extent.

### Miscellaneous Grains and Soybeans Pulled Up by Oil Cakes

Recently, the soybean market has been in a state of flatness for a long time. The reason is that the arrivals and sales are uneven, and people's sentiments are weak. Both buying and selling are not exciting. Yesterday's market sales were still very small, but the market price was affected by the rising wind of oil cakes, and the thoughts of cargo owners were inevitably moved, resulting in an increase of about half a yuan. It is estimated that 400 bags of Qingdao beans were sold at a price of 39 yuan, 300 bags of Guide beans were sold at a price of 38 yuan, 200 bags of Wuhu beans were sold at a price of 37.5 yuan, 400 bags of Tianjin beans were sold at a price of 41 yuan, and 250 bags of Tianjin green beans were sold at a price of 36.2 yuan. The destination is the street and a small number of exports.

Also, 200 bags of beans and 1,500 pieces of bean cake, 315 bags of raw peanuts, and 190 cans of tung oil were exported to Hong Kong on the 23rd.

### Sugar Market, Local Rock Candy Falls One Yuan

Yesterday's sugar market continued to decline. The price of coarse granulated sugar was slightly down by two or three cents. The guild's trading price for spot goods was 81.5 yuan for local warehouse receipts of Grade 24 white sugar, slightly two cents, 81.2 yuan for foreign warehouses, one yuan, slightly eight cents, slightly three cents, 81 yuan to 80.6 yuan for delivery orders dated March 10th. The price of Taikoo granulated sugar B mark Western warehouse was 81.2 yuan, down three cents, 80.8 yuan for Eastern warehouse, 80 yuan for DY mark Western warehouse, 79.8 yuan for Eastern warehouse, and 79.4 yuan for HHX mark Western warehouse, all without much fluctuation. The price of local factory number one ice was 102 cents, and Jingming ice was 103 yuan, both down by one yuan.

### Northern and Southern Goods, Black Melon Seeds Sold in Whole Batches

The recent market for black melon seeds has been more active. Therefore, the inventory of the nine or so companies organized by the industry has now released more than 860 bags. It is estimated that the price of Jizhong seeds is 112 yuan, the price of Guzhen seeds is 102 yuan, the price of Shuanggou seeds is 108 yuan, and the price of Tuxiao seeds is 105 yuan, all of which have been successfully opened.

### Seafood Qicai Market Prices Remain Firm

Qicai is now firmly priced due to the thin inventory and lack of arrivals. Yesterday's trading price for rough Qicai was 75 yuan, Xilan Qicai was 68 yuan, Longya Qicai was 59 yuan, and Wujiao Qicai was 58 yuan.

### Coal Shipping Costs Will Increase Again, and the Hemei Coal Market is Flourishing

Hongji white coal has recently entered mid-spring, and the sales market has been slightly inferior, but the external costs are huge. The shipping costs for the next day will increase by another US$1.8 per ton, resulting in a flourishing market and future price increases. Therefore, the daily trading is particularly strong. The price of block coal for industry warehouse receipts is 260 yuan per ton, and the price of coal fines is 168 yuan. The price of door shops on the street is increased by more than 10 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Items, Cigarette Hoarders Rise Again

Cigarette market prices have been soft recently, due to the narrow sales channels and fluctuating market prices. Yesterday's market suddenly boosted people's morale, and general hoarders began to search for purchases, resulting in prosperous prices. The price of Great Britain brand opened at 1,310 yuan, the price of Old Blade brand was 960 yuan, the price of Wuhua brand was 685 yuan, the price of Little Fairy brand was 685 yuan, and the price of ten-piece Great Front Door brand was 360 yuan per 10,000 pieces.

### Hardware, Black Iron Billets Stand Out

The recent black iron billet market has been particularly good. The source of overseas supply has been exhausted, and foreign firms have no fixed orders. Those who supply the market only rely on the inventory in the local area. However, the inventory of shops is limited, and the demand is enthusiastic. Therefore, the current market goods are in short supply. The local water bottle factory, machine factory, mirror factory, can making factory, and iron printing factory all search for goods every day, and those who engage in this business are not willing to easily sell them, and they all have the intention of holding on. Therefore, the standard has soared. The rise in the price of the industry has pushed the heads of various goods. For example, yesterday's shouting price for the old steel plant was 1,750 yuan, and the new steel plant was 1,700 yuan.

### Commemorating Washington's Birthday Enhances Belief in Democracy and Governance Washington's Great Achievements Symbolize China's Resistance and Reconstruction American Nationals in the City Celebrated Enthusiastically Yesterday

Yesterday was the 209th anniversary of the birth of Washington, the first President of the United States. He was the leader of the American Revolution, created the Republic, and his life's achievements were not only outstanding talents of the United States, but also the greatest figures in the world. Therefore, on the occasion of his birthday, American citizens all over the world celebrated uniformly on this day. This year, the American official offices, schools, groups and institutions in the city, in addition to the usual holiday, hung flags to celebrate, or held private banquets, and did not hold grand ceremonies. Mr. Ming Side, President of the American National Association, gave a radio speech to all American citizens in Shanghai at 6:20 pm yesterday at the American China Radio Station, No. 445 Racecourse Road, to commemorate Washington's great achievements during his lifetime, and there were other programs to praise Washington.

Striving for the Creation of a Republic Throughout His Life

Washington, the first President of the United States, was born in the village of Xue Mohelan in Virginia, USA. He was a studious and loyal man. At the age of fourteen, he was introduced to the Navy by Shi. When he was about to leave, he stopped at the persuasion of his mother and returned to school to practice mathematics. In the war between the British and French Canadian colonies, he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the Army for his meritorious service, and then resigned. In 1765, after the passage of the American Stamp Act, the Boston Tea Party was established, brewing the success of Lexington Polytechnic. He was elected as the Commander-in-Chief and declared war on Britain. In 1781, he surrendered to the British general Kang Risi. After two years, he completed the independence of North America, created the Republic, and was elected as the first President of the Republic. He diligently governed and rested with the people during his four-year tenure. The Americans called him the Father of the Country, and the capital Columbia was renamed Washington, where the current American government is located.

Mr. Ming Side's Radio Speech

Mr. Ming Side, President of the American Association, reviewed Washington's life deeds on the radio last night. In describing Washington's guidance of the American Revolutionary War, his determination, the hardships of his struggle, and the current situation of China's top leader are similar. In particular, the collection of people from thirteen states with different ideas and different thoughts under unity, relying only on a small amount of crude equipment, military fire, and finally won the final victory in repeated defeats and wars. This is especially symbolic of the bright future of China's resistance and reconstruction. The general meaning of the original text is as follows: Washington called on the people of the thirteen states under difficult circumstances and rose up in arms. At this time, it was not easy to make people with different ideas and different thoughts rise up together. Washington led a small number of poorly equipped soldiers to fight with soldiers who were several times larger and well-trained. Although he was often frustrated, he still shouted loudly and believed that he would win. As a result, he won the final victory in repeated defeats and battles, and regained the light in the darkness. After winning, ordinary people will have a color of pride. However, Washington said, "We must never slack off because of victory. We should wait until the final victory is achieved before we can rest." His colleagues had the same feeling for the difficulties ahead as Washington. They supported Washington until the great success was achieved. The war lasted for eight years, both before and after. The existence of the United States today is the result of these eight years of struggle. On Washington's birthday, we commemorate his contributions to the country, how can we not express our admiration? Washington's democratic spirit can be seen in his treatment of slaves. He repeatedly announced to the people of the country that the slavery system should be abolished. Marshall, a famous American jurist, said, "Washington is a victorious soldier, a successful ruler, resolute in will, and unyielding." It is not a false statement.

### Coolidge Returns to the Country A Thousand American Nationals Retreat The Crowd is Unprecedented The Ship is Equipped with Berths to Accommodate

It was confirmed yesterday (22nd) that about 1,000 American Nationals will leave Shanghai on the President Coolidge on Wednesday morning and return to the United States. According to a member of the President Steamship Company, several berths have been added to the President Coolidge to accommodate a large number of passengers. It is said that most of the American Nationals who are withdrawing from Shanghai are women and children, and many prominent American Nationals in Shanghai will also set off on the ship. The President Coolidge is crowded with passengers because the American Consulate General here again issued a warning a week ago to American Nationals to leave the Far East if it is "not necessary", and American Nationals rushed to buy tickets.

Prominent American Nationals Return Together

Since the U.S. Department of State first issued a withdrawal order last September, there have been few American Nationals leaving Shanghai, as many as 1,000 people on this Coolidge. The people who are unwilling to live and die who will set off on the ship on Wednesday include Mr. and Mrs. Gould, the editor of the English-language Da Mei Evening News, Bella Ya of the Associated Press, Colonel Xiang Pei, the former commander of the International Business Group, and Nash, the former office manager of the Engineering Bureau.

American Nationals in the Interior are Making Preparations

According to news from relevant American Nationals in the city, after receiving the advice to withdraw from the occupied areas of China, 115 American Nationals in Hankou have packed their bags and are ready to take a ship to Shanghai to return to their country, and more than 130 others have not yet decided. It is said that after the State Department issued the first warning this year, more than 30 American Nationals have left Hankou and returned to their country. It is also said that after 90 American Nationals in Tianjin withdrew last winter in accordance with the order, there are only 300 American Nationals left in Tianjin. Some of them have also decided to return to their country and will take a ship to Shanghai soon.

### Zhong Daohua Temporarily Received Relief Pu Jun Donated Money Ma Jun Sent Four Dou of Rice

### Air Mail to Guangzhou and Shantou Suddenly Increased in Price Yesterday

The Shanghai Postal Administration recently received an urgent telegram from the Guangzhou Postal Administration. Regarding air mail postage in South China, the airmail postage to Guangzhou and Shantou from Shanghai will be increased from 28 cents to 34 cents for every 20 grams or its odd number due to the different financial situation there. The postage for postcards will be 17 cents. The Shanghai Post Office has already followed suit since yesterday. However, the air mail transported by airmail in Central China, such as Nanjing, Hankou, Qingdao, Yantai, Beiping, Tianjin and other places, has not been increased in price, and is still 28 cents. It is said that the increase in fees for airmail in South China is due to the conversion of Japanese military tickets at market prices.

### Central Standing Committee Resolution Preferential Treatment Jin Huating A Letter to the National Government for Praise and Grant of Funeral Expenses The Central Government Specially Granted a Pension of 20,000 Yuan

### Abnormal Rice Prices, Deteriorating Lives of Common People, Price Increase of Tofu, a Common Side Dish, Has Significant Impact on Public Morale

The cost of living in this city has continued to rise this year, despite the increased value of legal tender, due to the manipulation of speculators. The most obvious examples are rice and coal, which have not fallen in price despite abundant stocks and low official prices. Vegetables are also very expensive due to price controls. Recently, tofu, a common side dish for citizens, has also been announced to increase in price due to the high price of raw material soybeans. It is hoped that the authorities can effectively stop speculators from manipulating the necessities of the people and reduce the burden on the citizens.

Rice Prices Exceed Limits

Yesterday, the rice market's buying and selling situation worsened. Not only were high-grade goods monopolized, but mid-grade goods were also being manipulated. The market was only adorned with inferior broken rice. However, off-market deals emerged one after another, reportedly exceeding the limit by two to three yuan. Most rice merchants still tried to cover up, saying that rice prices had not exceeded the limit, only admitting that the market situation was more chaotic than before. Rice brokers have recently relapsed into their old habits, again peddling rice off-market, engaging in illegal transactions, and taking huge commissions. The brokers' association turned a blind eye.

Public Morale

Hoarders holding onto spot goods are simply waiting for prices to rise. However, the authorities stipulated last year that rice merchants can obtain a 5% profit. If sold at the current regulated limit price, the profit is already more than 5%. When the rice price evaluation committee set the limit price, it already included a 5% profit and considered the market situation. Therefore, if rice merchants can sell according to the limit price, they will already obtain a profit. Now, speculators are holding onto spot goods and refusing to sell, causing rice prices to soar. This not only hinders the food supply of this city but also has an impact on the public morale, as rice prices rise despite sufficient reserves and smooth supplies. This should be paid attention to.

Tofu Price Increase

The Shanghai Tofu Trade Association decided to increase prices on the 26th of this month due to the soaring prices of raw materials such as soybeans and firewood for making tofu. The price list is as follows: (1) Extra-large old tofu, retail price at least 10 cents, 3.20 yuan per board; (2) Small old tofu, retail price at least 10 cents, 2.50 yuan per board; (3) Large soft tofu, retail price 5 cents, 2.20 yuan per board; (4) Tofu skin, 1.12 yuan per catty, 3 cents per sheet; (5) Large fragrant dried tofu, 10 cents per piece; (6) Fragrant stinky dried tofu, 5 cents per piece; (7) 20-cent oil tofu, 2.5 cents per piece; (8) Square oil tofu, 2 cents for odd numbers, 1.5 cents per piece; (9) Extra-small square oil tofu, small sliced square dried tofu, wholesale at 35 cents per hundred pieces; (10) Thick and thin fried dough sticks, retail price at least 10 cents, 1.60 yuan per catty; (11) Tofu skin clothing, 20 cents per sheet; (12) Fermented bean curd base, 2.20 yuan per board. Wholesale for the trade, 10% off the marked price, all using market scales.

### French Ambassador to China, Cosme, Travels North by Shuntian Wheel Steamer

The French Ambassador to China, Cosme, along with his wife, boarded the Taikoo Company's Shuntian Wheel steamer from the Jardine Matheson Wharf and departed from Shanghai to the north at 12:00 noon yesterday. The ambassador traveled with a simple entourage, only accompanied by Secretary Dale Lang. It is expected that the journey will take them to Tianjin tomorrow, from where they will travel to Peiping for a short stay to plan and oversee the embassy's relocation from Shanghai back to Peiping. He will then return to Shanghai in early next month, before travelling onwards to Hong Kong and Chongqing, remaining resident in the wartime capital to maintain close contact.

### Japan Is Already in a Difficult Situation, Unwilling to Be Involved in the European War, Also Unwilling to See War in the Pacific, Mediation of the European War Almost a Proven Fact

The English-language "China Press" commented that it has not been proven whether Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka suggested to Britain that he would act as a mediator in the European war. If Matsuoka had truly offered mediation, it is safe to say that Britain would not have accepted it. What is most important now is whether Japan has suggested a ceasefire in the European war. Because if Japan had made such a suggestion, it would be enough to prove that Japan is eager not to be involved in the European war vortex and also does not want to see war in the Pacific. Japan is clearly aware that due to the irresponsible remarks of its leaders and the behavior of its soldiers and people, it has fallen into a very difficult situation. Whether to step into the fire or rein in at the edge of the cliff, the dilemma is entirely created by Japan itself.

Condemning Britain and the United States for Not Reflecting on Themselves

Reading the records in yesterday morning's newspapers in this city, one can know that Japan is eager to solve this problem without exerting effort and without losing its remaining face. The Japanese said, "Japan has expressed its hope to maintain peace, but the United Kingdom and the United States have not put forward suggestions to appease the difficult situation." What we want to ask is, what kind of suggestions will Japan put forward? Why should the United Kingdom and the United States sacrifice their Pacific appeasement policy now?

Hundred Kinds of Harm to the Rights and Interests of Various Countries

The fact is that although Japan started the Sino-Japanese War with the mentality of quick battles and quick decisions, Japan not only failed to win, but also failed to achieve victory. As a result, it fell into the quagmire it had chosen. Another fact is that they have done everything possible to harm the rights of third countries in China and Asia. Although neutral countries have made various reconciliatory gestures to Japan, the result has only been Japan's increasing its degree of aggression.

Estimating the European War Completely Wrong

Japan's assessment of the European war was almost completely wrong, and it joined the "adventure map" with the intention of profiting from it, causing Japan to be on the verge of economic hardship, military weakness, and diplomatic isolation. All that remains is a record of "promising easily and believing little" and "barbaric aggression." Other than that, there is nothing else. In this state, it asks why Britain and the United States are so militaristic, why they ignore Japan's peace remarks in the past few days, and why they do not reward Japan's short-term good behavior as it should be. Our answer is simple: just laugh it off.

### Trial Mail to Shanghai

Postal services between Shanghai and the southwestern regions have gradually resumed smoothly after the Directorate General of Posts established two new routes: one via Hong Kong, Haiphong (Vietnam) and into Yunnan, and the other via Guangzhou to the border of Guangdong and then re-routed. Previously, the Kunming Postal Administration dispatched a batch of mail that was transported via the Yunnan-Burma Road. It has already been shipped from Yangon to Hong Kong and then transferred to Shanghai by long-haul ships. However, due to the many transportation difficulties along the way, this trial shipment took more than two months. It is not currently planned to use this route for transporting mail.

### The Status Quo of the International Settlement: Discussions on Urgent Improvements (III)

— Nash

Besides a miracle, the only hope is to wait calmly. The best policy is for the leaders of various countries in this port not to introduce the various policies of their respective governments into the municipal administration of the Shanghai International Settlement. This kind of policy must be effective only when all countries cooperate. Mere passive non-opposition is useless. The political power of the Shanghai International Settlement is still fundamentally complete and undamaged. Although some areas within the Settlement cannot be completely placed under control due to various pressures and obstacles, the war is still outside our fortress.

Standing Firm

It is truly commendable that the International Settlement has been able to compromise and seek perfection without sacrificing the basic principles of its management system under the pressure of the Asian war policy. In this International Settlement with a history of one hundred years, although it is in an environment of various challenges and dangers, it has been able to stand firm. This is due to the instructions of the philosophers, that is, to sacrifice the rule and monopoly of one country in order to preserve international inclusion and mutual independence. The welfare and prosperity of the Shanghai International Settlement are entirely dependent on its international characteristics. If any country attempts to monopolize this city of Shanghai, all the benefits of Shanghai's special status will disappear. However, while the International Settlement can cope with ease and stand firm in the environment of "war" policies, it seems to be compromising and seeking perfection in the face of today's Japanese demands for greater power in civic and municipal life. This is surprising. The most urgent problem facing the Shanghai International Settlement today is the division between Japanese residents and British and American residents on purely civil matters. To solve this problem, the leaders of the expatriate communities will be subject to the illusion of submission, moderation, tolerance and compromise. The Japanese residents' call for increased management power has reached its peak, dangerous signals have appeared, and we are still indifferent.

Japanese Residents' Demands

What the Japanese residents are asking for, it is said, is that no national expatriate community may have control and dictatorship in municipal affairs. According to the official document issued by the Japanese Ratepayers Association on December 24, 1940, "Accepting the position of British residents is not for the purpose of monopolizing the administrative power of the International Settlement, but for improving this administration and making it internationalized. This point has been explained in the last election meeting and taxpayers' meeting, so that residents of all countries have equal rights to participate in the administration, and enjoy equal benefits in trade and life." Such documents are naturally high-sounding and eloquent, and there is nothing to discuss.

Guilt Inescapable

Then where is the difficulty? The answer is that although the Japanese residents say so on the surface, there is suspicion of planning to achieve their national and sovereign goals in the International Settlement behind the scenes. What the Japanese residents suspect of the British and American residents is exactly what the latter suspect of the former, that is, Japan uses local trifles to achieve its national affairs. Therefore, in order to restore trust with each other, both sides must be open and honest, and must never use the municipal government to achieve their national purposes. In all fairness, the Japanese residents are guilty of creating this fear, and they speculate on others with their own narrow minds. Moreover, the official document issued by the Japanese Ratepayers Association even conflates the municipal goals of the Japanese residents and advocates returning the International Settlement to the Nanjing "regime."

Eradicate Evil

What we hope from the Japanese residents is that they will uphold the original intention of the International Settlement and urgently demand that their national authorities restore the municipal management power of this port, especially in the area north of Suzhou Creek, eliminating the control of national affairs and replacing the management of municipal agencies. In addition, the Japanese residents should do their best to advocate to their authorities that various crimes condoned by the Japanese authorities in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads area must be eliminated before satisfactory improvements can be made.

Reasonable Solution

At the same time, British and American residents should also give good faith consideration to the purpose of the Japanese residents regarding genuine municipal issues in this port. Such mutual understanding, even if there are some "technical" problems of the Yangjingbang Land Charter in the middle, can also create the necessary reforms in municipal management. The territorial sovereignty of the International Settlement belongs to China, which is beyond doubt. However, under the current circumstances, the affairs of this city should be based on the basic policy of local negotiation. It is not the time to request the reduction of the Yangjingbang Land Charter from Chongqing or Nanjing. Our suggestion is that all affairs of the International Settlement are currently dominated by international citizens, and no national government should have real ruling power. In this way, the Yangjingbang Charter can also be unaffected, and the trend of the so-called improvement plan is first to increase the power of Chinese citizens in the municipality, and second, the power of foreigners in the municipality should be distributed in a more accurate proportion. This plan is in line with the goals stated by Judge Fei Tang ten years ago. (End)

### Don't Despair Because of Sickness

When you have a little sickness, please don't despair. You can use the sickness. The author of "Gone with the Wind", Margaret Mitchell, wrote that masterpiece while she was in the hospital. The members of the American human body association have all been injured.

However, we don't have to endure the pain, because sometimes the pain is easy to get rid of. For example, headaches, toothaches, rheumatism, or menstrual cramps, just take one or two tablets of Saridon, because Saridon is very effective for relieving pain. It can be completely stopped in less than ten minutes because it is manufactured by Roche Ltd. in Switzerland, so it is very reliable.

### Japanese Side Admits to Rickshaw Pulling in Hongkou, But Says It Was Done by Hired Foremen

The English-language "China Press" reported that it has recently been rumored that the Japanese Army "rickshaw pulling team" is active in the northern district of the International Settlement. The Japanese military authorities have blamed this on Chinese foremen. According to a Japanese military officer here this morning (22nd), the Japanese side has investigated the rickshaw pulling news and has learned that the Japanese military authorities did not directly hire laborers. The matter was entirely handled by Chinese foremen. The foremen recruited laborers and earned commissions. These laborers often gathered in one place and were transported to the work site by Japanese military trucks. The foremen, in order to obtain more laborers and make huge profits, often forcibly recruited some unemployed Chinese who were not laborers. As a result, after these Chinese were taken to the work site by the Japanese army, some refused to work. Most of the sentries could not speak Chinese. Whenever they saw Chinese refusing to work, they would detain them, but they did not take strict precautions, so many escaped. Those who later made anti-Japanese remarks were actually hired with funds from the Japanese side. The Japanese military authorities did not force Chinese to work. If there was rickshaw pulling, it was done by Chinese foremen.

### Physician Shen Jian'an and His Wife Seriously Injured in Shooting Yesterday, Three People Broke into Clinic and Suddenly Opened Fire, Shen Injured in the Eye, Wife Shot in the Breast

At 10:20 am yesterday, a sniper attack occurred at No. 50, Lane 429, Chongqing Road, International Settlement (i.e., Malishi New Village). The victims were physician Shen Jian'an and his wife, each shot once. They were later sent to Fumin Hospital for treatment. The shooters escaped without a trace after the incident. The details are recorded as follows:

Disguised as Patients

Shen Jian'an, 34 years old, from Yuyao, Zhejiang, has a clinic on the third floor of No. 50, Malishi New Village, Lane 429, Chongqing Road (the lower floor is Liang Ru Preserved Meat Shop). He owns a car. At 10:20 am yesterday, three men in long robes, about 20 years old, suddenly entered the clinic on the second floor, disguising themselves as patients. After the three men saw Shen, one of them took out a pistol from his sleeve and opened fire on Shen.

Husband and Wife Injured

Shen was caught off guard. The skin under his left eye was shot and he fell to the ground in extreme pain. At that time, Shen's wife, Shen Zhuzi, was shocked to hear the murder and bravely rushed towards the murderer and shouted for help. She was also shot once, hitting Zhuzi's right breast. The bullet entered her heart and abdomen. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the three men took their weapons and went downstairs and escaped without a trace. Shen and his wife fell in pools of blood, barely breathing.

Police Investigation

After hearing the news, the Chengdu Road Police Station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate. However, the perpetrators had already disappeared. They took the bullet casings back and summoned an ambulance to send the injured Shen and his wife to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. It was reported that Shen Zhuzi's bullet entered her abdomen and did not come out. She lost a lot of blood and was in critical condition. Shen was shot in the face and his injuries were minor and not life-threatening.

Shen's Life Story

Shen graduated from the last class of the Nanyang Medical University and then studied medicine in Japan. He graduated from the Medical School of the Imperial University of Japan. He married a Japanese woman, who took the Chinese name Shen Zhuzi, and is now 29 years old. He returned to China in 1933 and has been here for eight years. They have two sons, the eldest son is seven years old and the second son is six years old. They live on the third floor of the house. Shen once served as a doctor at Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road. In addition to practicing medicine there, he also opened Lao Qinglong Jinji Silver Shop at No. 208, North Zhejiang Road, and served as manager. His father, Shen Jintang, passed away 20 years ago. His mother, Yu, is 66 years old and now lives in the silver shop. As for the reason for Shen's attack, it is generally speculated that it was a personal vendetta.

Chevrolet Car Exhibition

The 1941 Chevrolet, with its 90-horsepower engine in the most widely sold low-priced car category, is the most powerful. Its "Victory" engine is an overhead valve type, the same as the style that holds global land, sea and air records. It has been shipped to Shanghai by the local dealer, the Lee & Company at 100 Avenue Edward VII, and is on display starting yesterday. Visitors are welcome.

### Falsely Establishing a Yarn Firm to Buy and Sell on Behalf of Customers, Defrauding Over 400,000 Yuan, 15 Yarn Firms Report to the Police to Request Arrest, Zhang Bingtao on the Run, Cao Jingyu Arrested

Yongfengde Yarn Firm at No. 9, Jinyu Lane, No. 456 Avenue Edward VII, is managed by yarn broker Zhang Bingtao. Recently, 15 Shandong Shen Zhuang firms, such as Yusheng Heng and Hengsheng Yi at No. 22, Shenkang Lane, Avenue Edward VII, cannot purchase yarn from the market because they are not yarn brokers. Therefore, they entrusted Yongfengde to buy and sell on their behalf through the introduction of Cao Jingyu. As usual, they had to pay a considerable amount of security deposit. Now, the profits and security deposits of Yusheng Heng and others entrusted to buy and sell have been embezzled by Yongfengde, totaling 400,1745 yuan, including (1) Yusheng Heng 66,750 yuan, (2) Hengsheng Yi 51,000 yuan, (3) Xiefenghao 6,000 yuan, (4) Fukanghao 55,220 yuan, (5) Longshengxianghao 15,700 yuan, (6) Tongshengfu 59,675 yuan, (7) Shengtai Cloth Shop 54,000 yuan, (8) Dingtai Silver Shop 38,000 yuan, (9) Xieyuhao 5,000 yuan, (10) Hengjuhao 5,000 yuan, (11) Si Chenghao 10,500 yuan, (12) Xieshunyu 11,900 yuan, (13) Shunjihhao 10,000 yuan, (14) Xiemaohao 8,000 yuan, (15) Yonghe Gonghao 5,000 yuan. Because they could not get their money back after repeated requests, and Zhang Bingtao avoided meeting them, they reported to the Central Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Sun Shuchun, it was recognized that Cao Jingyu was suspected of collusion, so Cao was arrested and escorted to the Criminal Court No. 4 of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested detention pending investigation and prosecution. After questioning by Judge Pei, the court ordered detention pending rescheduling for another hearing.

### Grand Banquet Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of Heji Educational Supplies Company

Yesterday, the company hosted a high-level banquet at Tongxinglou to entertain Chinese and foreign guests, with more than 500 people attending. The company's manager, Wang Fuqing, and others cordially received the guests. Shen Tongyi, the principal of Nanyang Model School, and Huang Zhongming, the chairman of the Stationery Association, delivered speeches successively, highly praising the company's late manager, Wang Gongxiaotang, for his hard work and turning it into a great business in the stationery industry. Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, and female stars sang, and the guests and hosts dispersed in joy late at night.

### Years of Litigation Over Disputed Rent Has Reached One Million National Currency, Defendant Strenuously Argues for Rent Payment Based on Revised Prices, Court Orders Final Debate and Awaits Judgment Yesterday

The landlord Sui Li Hadong of the property from Yile Tian to Tong Yuchun on Nanjing Road and the tenant Zhu Jieren have repeatedly engaged in rent lawsuits due to the issue of the Chinese-British exchange rate. Recently, Sui Li Hadong, with the last two installments of rent due, totaling £2,200, hired lawyers Ma Shouhua, Xu Runquan, and Cao Shoulin to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting the court to order Zhu Jieren to pay the rent based on the HSBC exchange rate. Based on the lawsuit, the court opened Civil Court No. 2 for interrogation yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 pm by Judge Mo Runhua.

Defendant Quan Jieren hired two lawyers, He Shiming and Wang Jian'e, to appear in court. First, the lawyers representing the plaintiff Sui Li Hadong successively stated the facts and reasons for the lawsuit, stating that the two parties signed a land lease contract in 1916, with an annual rent of £4,400, divided into four installments, each installment being £1,100, calculated based on the London exchange rate on the date of payment of the rent, with a lease term of 25 years, expiring at the end of March of this year. After the two parties signed the contract, the calculation was based on HSBC bank exchange rates for the past 20 years. The defendant had no objections. Until 1938, the defendant suddenly claimed that the calculation should be based on the exchange rate of the Central Bank, resulting in several lawsuits, all of which were ruled against the defendant by the court, but without final judgment. The facts and reasons of this case are the same as the previous cases. Since the litigation has lasted for years, the defendant owes a total of £13,200 in rent, which, according to today's HSBC bank's listing, has reached one million Chinese national currency. Therefore, in addition to requesting the court to rule that the calculation be based on the HSBC bank exchange rate, it is also requested that the court approve the declaration of provisional execution. Then, Lawyer He Wangnan, representing Zhu Jieren, argued that the defendant

Does Not Owe Rent

It is because the two parties have a dispute over the British exchange rate. The two parties did not stipulate in the original contract that the rent should be paid based on the HSBC bank exchange rate. It only stated that the payment of rent should be paid in Chinese currency converted at the London exchange rate on the date of payment. Moreover, the validity period of this contract is 25 years. When the contract was originally signed, the HSBC bank's existence period was approved by the Governor of Hong Kong to August 13, 1929, and its life span was not as long as the term of the lease between the two parties. How can the HSBC bank exchange rate be the standard? The Central Bank is the

National Bank

of the Republic of China. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice have repeatedly ordered that all Chinese nationals should abide by the exchange rate stipulated by the Central Bank. In recent years, the HSBC bank's listing is obviously a black market. The Chinese-British exchange rate should be based on the legal price set by the Central Bank, without any doubt. Although the previous cases were ruled against the defendant by your court, the Supreme Court sent them back for retrial and completely pointed out the errors in the facts and reasons identified by the original trial. Therefore, we ask the court to reject the plaintiff's request. Judge Mo reviewed the statements and ordered the trial to be concluded and await judgment.

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 pm yesterday stated that the weather in Shandong, here, and the East China Sea is clear and colder, with strong northwest to northeast winds. There is rainfall in South China. The weather around northern Japan is bad, with cyclones and snowfall, due to the deep low pressure passing through to the northeast-east. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 pm yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 48.7 degrees and the lowest was 40.8 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 57.2 degrees and the lowest was 31.1 degrees.

Children's Weekly

### Stir Up Interest in Work!

— Xin Liang

Children, I know that as soon as you hear the word "work," you're bound to feel unhappy. "We're still young, of course we can't handle any heavy work!" Some children will say that. And other children will say, "We're still children, we haven't reached the age to work yet!" Undoubtedly, they are wrong.

A "person" is originally a machine. After the machine takes in coal, it must move and work; similarly, anyone who calls himself a "person" must do some work after eating his fill. Do you want to be called a "rice bucket" by others? Are you willing to have others give you the nickname "lazy worm"? I believe you definitely don't like that, so from today onwards, please stir up your interest in work!

Speaking of the ways and types of "work," there's truly no end to the discussion. If you don't have servants at home, you can take twenty minutes after returning from school to tidy up the room for your mom and pick up the trash. On the one hand, you can gain a lot of "experience" in work. On the other hand, Mom will definitely love you very much. Whenever relatives come to visit, she might say to them, "My child is so good, he already knows how to manage the household!" After hearing such praise, you will certainly feel boundless happiness in your heart.

Is there a child next door who can't go to school because of poverty? If so, then your "work" is truly meaningful. You might as well go to his house three or four times a week, bringing the books you used to read at school, and in a friendly way, teach him to recognize a few characters. He and his parents will be extremely grateful to you!

When starting "work" at first, children may feel a bit "bitter" or "uncomfortable," but as long as you have a little patience, I can guarantee that everyone will become very happy, and perhaps even unwilling to stop.

Children, please stir up your interest in "work"! "Work" can allow you to gain a lot of valuable "knowledge" and "experience." This "knowledge" and this "experience" can absolutely not be found in the textbooks at school!

### How to Write a Diary?

— Jin Xianfa

You should record good, novel things you see, strive to avoid prolixity, and use simple, fluent writing so it doesn't become empty; write truthfully, and don't make something out of nothing or fabricate events at will. The most important thing in children's diaries is naturalness, like the flowers and plants of early spring, and even more like the gently flowing water by the green hills and in the small rivers, full of vital power.

Materials are available anytime, anywhere: the weather and seasons, for example, rain, snow, the blue sky and white clouds on a clear day, flying birds, the fields in spring and summer, and active insects; hardly anything you see every day is the same. They are constantly changing. Also, every good or bad circumstance, every story of sorrow and joy, and the dynamics of various figures in society and in the world can also be vividly written in your diary, which shouldn't be as monotonous and commonplace as eating, sleeping, playing, crying, and laughing.

Observe more, imagine more, and boldly write your diary.

Stories heard from other people's mouths, new knowledge seen in books, shouldn't be lightly let go; you should also quickly record them in your diary.

It's best to choose scenes from life and write about them meticulously, and not just write about the rough outline of the entire thing. If you come back from a park visit, instead of laboriously describing the entire scene of the park, it would be more interesting to write about just the "riverside," "beside the flowerbed," "inside the pavilion," or "a corner of the zoo," or "the ducks," and wouldn't make people feel bored; you might even get praise from your teachers!

Don't write sporadically; you must be persistent, or you will never have the interest to continue writing.

Start writing from today, and continue until next year and the year after; after one notebook is filled, change to a new one. This way, when you finish your entire schooling, how much will you have written in your diary? I think that at that time, there will definitely be a very satisfactory harvest; look and see!

Writing a diary is not a difficult thing, but only fear that you are unwilling to write well. Each dear child, quickly work hard to write your diary more in this spring, and make your diary your closest friend.

### The Story of Electricity

— Zhou Xi

Many years ago, someone discovered that rubbing silk fabrics—like silk handkerchiefs—with a glass rod could make the glass rod attract very small pieces of paper. They called this phenomenon electrification. Later, during a thunderstorm, Benjamin Franklin flew a kite with a copper wire string. The electricity in the sky was transmitted down through the copper wire. Thus, everyone knew that the flashing light and rumbling thunder in the sky were also the effects of electricity.

In 1800 AD, Humphry Davy invented the battery and the arc lamp. In 1832, Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction, and as a result, Zénobe Gramme created the generator and the electric motor. In 1879, Thomas Edison invented the electric light. In this way, electricity was widely applied.

The generation of electricity: Electromagnetic induction. A magnet, is a lodestone. Now let's take a horseshoe magnet, and wrap a section of copper wire into a coil and place it between the south and north poles to rotate it. Then, an electric current is generated in this coil. We know that electric current can also generate magnetism, so the current in this coil generates magnetic force. The action of this magnetic force is to resist the rotation of the coil; therefore, if we continue to rotate the coil and connect the two ends of the coil to a light bulb, then a continuous current can be generated, making the light bright. This is the basic principle of modern generators.

### Wax Statues Always Cave In

— Yi Wu

Zhao'er learned how to make wax statues at school, and happily ran home to put his ideas into practice. He first asked his mother for thirty cents, eagerly went to the store, chose the best of many models, conveniently bought a few small candles, and then began to make his wax statue.

He first took a basin of cold water, and then soaked the stubborn old man he had bought in the water; on the other hand, he melted the wax crayons, very vividly combined the model, his hands and feet very nimbly distributing it evenly everywhere, and finally put it in the water; gently revealing the model, but unfortunately, the old stubborn man's head caved in. He failed. He didn't lose heart at all, and kept doing it, doing it! But he still couldn't do it well. If the head didn't cave in, then the chest would. In the end, he couldn't make a wax statue that satisfied him.

Zhao'er's older brother, Lin'er, who was boarding at middle school, came home on Sunday. When Zhao'er saw his brother, he recounted everything about making wax statues, and asked Lin'er why the wax statues always caved in.

After pondering for a moment, Lin'er replied, "Usually when making wax statues, you always stick it to the model. This is because you didn't soak it in water. As for sticking even after soaking in water, that's because the wax is burned too hot. Overly hot wax, when poured into the model, evaporates the many moisture that has been absorbed instantly, which is the same as not soaking it in water, so it sticks firmly. As for the reason for caving, that's because the air pressure inside the wax statue is smaller than outside the wax statue. When the wax in the model is still soft, and because the cohesive force of the wax is strong, the wax shape is pressed in and becomes concave when the external air pressure is greater than its internal pressure. As for your spirit of trying again and again, it's very commendable, but random trials without knowing the method or having a plan will not succeed even after a hundred or a thousand trials." His brother added, "To make the wax statue full, you must dig a small hole next to the plaster model, and use a matchstick to plug the small hole. Before putting it in the water, pull out the matchstick and blow air into the small hole with your mouth, so that the air pressure inside the wax statue is greater than outside. Then it will definitely not cave in and will be printed more clearly." After saying this, Zhao'er excitedly ran out and continued to make the wax statue he had not yet achieved the goal of in his ideal.

Do what you can do yourself. I am a Chinese child.

### Fun Q&A

— Zhi Yu

### Water Chestnut

One water chestnut, four corners,

Outside is the shell, inside is the meat;

Little brother, doesn't know how to peel it,

Faces the water chestnut and cries.

### Seesaw

Seesaw,

Seesaws a few times,

One end falls, one end rises high,

Up and down, the fun is great.

### Discussing the Theatrical Art of Shang Heyu

— Yin Sheng

Before discussing the topic, let me first talk about the strengths and weaknesses of Shang Heyu and Yang Xiaolou.

Shang, a native of Baodi, is a steady person who doesn't easily smile. Therefore, many people call him "Old Dao Shang." Shang has superb skill in the three-character classic "steady," "accurate," and "ruthless," which all martial performers must learn. This is where Xiaolou falls short. However, Xiaolou's voice and appearance are both outstanding, while Shang's aged appearance and hoarse voice inevitably pale in comparison. In plays like "Qilin Pavilion," "Golden Money Leopard," "An Tian Hui," "Battle of Wancheng," and "Lianhuan Tao," Xiaolou is better than old Shang. The good looks of the costume in "Qilin Pavilion," the startling white mouth in "Golden Money Leopard," the agility of the action in "An Tian Hui," the wonderful spirit in "Battle of Wancheng," and the clear dialogue in "Lianhuan Tao" cannot be achieved by old Shang.

But old Shang's "Taking Gao Deng," the grandeur of "Iron Cage Mountain," the spirit of "Si Ping Mountain" and "Cherishing the Orangutan," as well as the fineness of the painted faces in these four plays, Xiaolou himself sighed that he could not match. Xiaolou's old man roles were better than Shang's. Shang's martial Jing roles ("Jia Meng Guan" Zhang Fei and "Battle of Wancheng" Dian Wei are the most famous) were admired by Xiaolou.

Shang's life in recent years has been extraordinarily hard, but this old man can endure poverty. When Xiaolou had just passed away, Shang once revived his banner and performed in Tianjin and Beijing, with great momentum, but soon he was no longer valued, and the attendance was dismal, almost unable to maintain it. But his ambition was not extinguished by lack of followers. My friend, Mr. Chen, once visited Shang backstage when Shang performed at the China Grand Theater in Tianjin, and Shang said, "We singers, if we can sing, we should serve you gentlemen for a few more years, we can't sing when we can't move."

Shang has many disciples. In the south are Yang Ruiting and Lin Shusen (Yang and Lin are also Shang's adopted sons) who are currently performing; in Tianjin are Han Changbao, Zhu Xiaoyi, Zhang Defa, Lou Tingyu, Hou Yongkui, and Ding Bingchun; and in Beiping there is a young martial performer Huang Yuanqing.

Yang Ruiting's late-year momentum does have some similarities with Shang's, but the spirit is too far apart. Lin Shusen doesn't seem to have grasped the essence. Han Changbao is good in everything, especially his footwork, but unfortunately his stage presence is insufficient, and good fortune doesn't appear, long flowing and contaminated with wildness. Zhu Xiaoyi was good in his early years, but he didn't know how to cherish himself and gave up halfway, and his whereabouts are unknown today. Zhang Defa is a martial Jing, and once performed at the Tianchan Stage in this city a few years ago. "Burning Yu Hong" is his masterpiece. He has Shang's courage but lacks Shang's steadiness, and is too rough. Lou Tingyu followed Shang the longest, but unfortunately he is not good material and is not enough to inherit his master's mantle. Hou Yongkui comes from Kunqu opera, and his martial arts skills are good, but unfortunately his eyes are lifeless and his mouth lacks strength. In "Five Heroes" and "Picking the Cart," "Iron Cage Mountain," besides the extra high-pitched flavor of the white mouth (those who sing Kunqu opera have more high-pitched people), there are many similarities with Shang, and his voice is very penetrating, which is better than his master. Ding Bingchun is a martial clown, and a nominal disciple. As for Huang Yuanqing, he is a student of Fu Liancheng, and his martial skills are very good. He specializes in long coats, but unfortunately he has never been seen "rising," and in the future, he will at most become a Han Changbao II. Hou Yongkui is the most promising among Shang's disciples, and then Gao Shenglin and Yang Shengchun.

Yang Xiaolou's "Green Stone Mountain"

### "Hundred Tribulations Hero"

The pioneering hero Rogers led his subordinates and broke through many difficulties with indomitable perseverance. However, his subordinates were sick and injured, and although he had a spirit of universal love, he could not delay the more important pioneering work for the sake of individual illnesses and injuries. However, he also had a condition: he would never abandon his subordinates unless it was absolutely impossible to help them. Just like the picture above, it shows this great hero helping his subordinates step into the boat, preparing to cross the river. After crossing the river, he adopted a scorched-earth determination to inspire his subordinates' spirit of advancement.

### Random Notes from the Art World

— Shou Wu

Minhua has discovered a newcomer. This person's facial features and figure are very good. He is currently studying at ×× University. He has considerable stage experience, so all the conditions are good enough, but whether or not to hire him will depend on testing him in front of the camera. Minhua's production attitude has always been meticulous, and it is putting all its efforts into "World Children." Therefore, it is only natural that it is very strict in selecting newcomers.

It is said that Asia has a new film starring Claudette Colbert, which will be translated into Chinese as "World Children." It is said that the play is based on the current European war and has a fairly correct consciousness, this information is not false and is indeed "overtaking on the corner".

Zhang Cuihong's asking a lawyer to publish a notice in the newspaper was actually her husband's idea, because Xu Heng didn't want Zhang to show her face in films. However, there are still many people who have recently been strongly requesting Zhang to make films, and it has been too much trouble to decline them one by one. Therefore, this advertisement came about.
