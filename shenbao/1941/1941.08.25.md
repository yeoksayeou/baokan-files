### Japanese Envoy Nomura Visits Hull: Frank Discussion of Far Eastern Difficulties, Elaborating on the Positions of Various Countries but Reaching No Conclusion; Nomura Says U.S.-Japan Differences May Be Resolved

United Press International, Washington, 24th. Japanese Ambassador to Washington, Nomura, met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday and afterwards told reporters that he believed the differences between the U.S. and Japan could be remedied. Nomura said, "If this is not the case, its foolishness is beyond description." He declined to disclose the contents of the meeting but hoped that the navigation difficulties could be resolved. He declined to answer questions about whether he planned to raise the issue of the United States handling the transportation of war materials to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok. Nomura told reporters, "Our conversation was not like that of diplomats, but like that of ordinary people. Mr. Hull outlined your government's position, which we already knew. I outlined my government's position, but no conclusion was reached." When referring to remedying the differences between the U.S. and Japan, Nomura said, "I firmly believe that this can be done, but I don't know how to do it yet."

Reuters, Washington, 24th. Japanese Ambassador to the U.S., Nomura, after meeting with Secretary of State Hull, hosted reporters and said that the differences between the U.S. and Japan's Far Eastern policies must be communicated, although he currently does not know how to communicate them, he firmly believes that they can be communicated. During his talks with Hull, he had a frank discussion of general difficulties related to the Pacific, but no agreement was reached. They did not consider each other as diplomats, but as people who wanted to seek a mutually satisfactory solution to the main differences.

Reuters, Tokyo, 24th. The Hochi Shimbun this morning carried remarks by political commentator Shimizu criticizing Prime Minister Konoe, saying that Japan currently needs a firm and unwavering policy, but Konoe is overly influenced by conflicting forces. The Imperial Rule Assistance Association has failed to unify public opinion, now admits its weakness and requests public assistance. Other organizations initiated by Konoe have also failed to achieve anything, because Konoe listens to everyone and does nothing. If the country does not have a more resolute figure, it will be defeated by the enemy.

The Far East Crisis is Not Resolved, It is Difficult for Europe to Obtain Peace

Havas, Chongqing, 23rd. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun published a statement that China sent Cheng Qian to Moscow to participate in the British, American, and Soviet conference. The government spokesperson here refuted it, pointing out that it was completely fabricated. Also, the Japanese side broadcast the news of Yang Jie going to the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources also said that there was absolutely nothing of the sort.

Havas, Chongqing, 23rd. Today's Central Daily News editorial, titled "The Moscow Conference and the Far East," said that under the current situation, long-term war preparation is extremely important, and how to enable the Soviet Union to intensify its resistance against Nazi attacks is particularly urgent. In order to enable the Soviet Union to fully confront the European Nazis, it must first be relieved of its worries in the East. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the Moscow Conference will conduct a close review of the Far Eastern situation. Japan's strategy is eight big characters: "Burying head in preparation, waiting for the opportunity to move." All actions of the aggressor are swift actions at their most advantageous time. The invaded are in an extremely unfavorable position. If we do not change from passive to active in the future, the future will still be difficult to be optimistic. Roosevelt's, Churchill's declarations and the Moscow Conference are active, but still formally active, and still insufficient, and must be substantial and lively. The Moscow Conference discussed the utilization of united resources, and should recognize the entire situation to serve as the standard for distribution. On the eve of the meeting, we specially remind the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain to pay attention that the Far East is more important than Europe, and that without first resolving the Far Eastern crisis, Europe will not obtain peace.

Havas, Manila, 23rd. Japanese residents here withdrew a batch last Monday, totaling about 400 people. Today, another batch of 150 people withdrew to their country.

### Puget Sound Area: U.S. Military Exercises

United Press International, Sand Point, 24th. A large number of defensive forces have gone to the front line yesterday and will launch a massive counter-attack this morning to begin military exercises in the Puget Sound area. It is expected that the offensive of the defense forces will be carried out in the vicinity of Shelton to repel the aggressors of the "Gray Age." The "Red" Navy (the invading army has eight cruisers, twelve destroyers, and multiple aircraft carriers) is stationed at the entrance of the Puget Sound, and Seattle and Bremerton are also feeling the threat of "invasion." According to the defensive headquarters here, troop transports are leading the Red Navy and can land in Anacortes Harbor on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, because the defenders do not have a navy.

Burma Continues to Levy Transit Taxes on Goods Transported to China; U.S. Public Opinion Expresses Dissatisfaction; British Government Orders a 1% Reduction

Reuters, London, 24th. U.S. news agencies have instructed their London correspondents to inquire about information regarding Burma levying transit taxes on goods transported to China under the Lend-Lease Act. This move indicates that U.S. public opinion is dissatisfied with the continued collection of such transit taxes, because it is incompatible with the common purpose of assisting China. Since the United States has sacrificed everything under the Lend-Lease Act, Burma should also make some sacrifices.

United Press International, London, 24th. Authoritative sources here stated yesterday that the British government has sent an urgent official document to the Burmese government, stating that the tariff of 1% of the value should be reduced for all Lend-Lease goods transported to China via Burma. It is believed here that Burma is an autonomous political entity, especially with regard to all internal affairs, such as tariffs, and has complete autonomy, but authoritative sources said that the British government believes that all Lend-Lease goods should be exempt from taxes. The Burmese tax authorities' defense stated that the tax rate had already been reduced since the reopening of the Burma Road last October, and that the Burmese government had paid special expenses for the construction of the Burma Road. It also said that goods transported to China are often piled up in Lashio, which often requires the Burmese government to provide special police and unloading places. The Burmese government has also paid huge expenses for repairing this road.

Reuters, London, 24th. The Ministry of Commerce has just issued an order prohibiting the export of any goods to China, Japanese-controlled Pacific islands, and Australia from Monday, except for those with licenses. However, this prohibition does not apply to those entering mainland China via the Burma Road from Rangoon. If those entering China from Rangoon are goods that require a license to be exported to any location outside the British Empire, they will also require a license in the future. It is heard that the purpose of this order is to intensify the suppression of exports to Japan and cut off the route of trade between the occupied areas of China and Japan. Therefore, this order is like the freezing of Chinese funds, and is not an action detrimental to China, but actually helps China. Its impact can keep the Burma Road open without any restrictions.

United Press International, Washington, 24th. The U.S. Red Cross Headquarters here stated yesterday that its work in China is increasing day by day. Another report said that rice and wheat are transported to Hong Kong and Shanghai by American ships, and large quantities of medicines are transported to Rangoon via the Burma Road, so that they can go directly to the free Chinese area. The report also stated that the Red Cross's war relief expenses, to date, total US$47,087,052, of which the United Kingdom received US$25,340,330, and China received about US$3,000,000.

Overseas Chinese Groups Donate to Help Britain

Reuters, Singapore, 24th. The first week of September will be "Aid Britain Week." At that time, overseas Chinese in Malaya will donate to help Britain to express their gratitude for being able to live in Malaya without disturbance, without being poisoned by the Japanese, and for Britain's aid to China. This move was decided at a meeting of overseas Chinese representatives in Southeast Asia. A representative said that the only way to avoid future suffering is to shorten the war period, and the best way to reduce the war period is to promote Britain's victory. Another representative told others that what the Chinese Foreign Minister said, that the victory of democratic countries will first be seen in the Far East, seems to be realized. Japan is now preparing to show its high-pressure tactics on both the sea and land, which just completes the encirclement it has called upon itself. The front line of democratic countries from north to south is about to be completed, and ABCD will do their best to defeat Japan and the Axis powers.

London, 23rd. Representatives of various overseas Chinese groups here held a League Conference to raise funds for the Chinese Disaster Relief Fund today, and decided to set the first week of September as Aid Britain Week to raise funds to relieve British refugees.

### Burma Can Cope with Any Eventuality at Any Time; French in Saigon Oppose Vichy's Concessions

Reuters, 24th. Burma is a very important place in the entire strategy of the Far East. If the war extends to that place, Britain's finest war equipment and troops can be used. This is known from the endless stream of young British sea and air warriors entering and leaving Rangoon. Although these strong men look young, they are indeed veterans. Many of them wear hard-won medals. Since Japan occupied the airfields of Vietnam, Burma has built an airfield line connecting to Malaya, so it can cope with the actions of other parties at any time.

Reuters, London, 24th. The Free French Command bulletin stated that the French in Saigon publicly expressed their opposition to Vichy's concessions to Japan. A French officer who escaped from Saigon after the Japanese army arrived in Vietnam said that the French in Saigon were extremely indignant about the pro-Japanese attitude of Governor-General Decoux and repeatedly took public actions to express their dissatisfaction.

### US Orders Seizure of Federal Shipyard to Avoid Hindrance to Shipbuilding Program

According to a United Press dispatch from Hyde Park on the 24th, President Roosevelt signed an executive order yesterday to seize the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Kearny, New Jersey. The plant has been on strike for sixteen days. The President ordered the Navy Department to take possession of the plant immediately, as the facility has $493,000,000 in national defense shipbuilding contracts. The shipyard will resume operations on Monday morning, including the construction of six destroyers, three oil tankers, and two cargo ships.

According to a Reuters dispatch from Hyde Park on the 24th, White House sources indicate that a decision on whether the government will purchase, lease, or seek a manager for the Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company will be made after further study.

Editorial

US-Japan Negotiations

In the past month, US-Japan relations have experienced at least three periods of tension: the US and Britain announced the freezing of Japanese assets on July 26th, Japanese planes bombed the American gunboat Tutuila in Chongqing on the 30th, and recently, Japanese officials prevented American citizens from returning home on the Coolidge. All of these events caused significant fluctuations. Furthermore, matters such as US and British concerns over Thailand, the US ban on exporting aviation fuel to Japan, the issuance of the Atlantic Charter, and the US sending oil tankers to Vladivostok to aid the Soviet Union have all been met with repeated opposition from Japanese officials. US-Japan relations have been steadily deteriorating recently. However, the aforementioned periods of tension have not led to the outbreak of a larger conflict. On the contrary, most of them have been defused, quickly returning to calm after a period of clamor. And between Grew and Toyoda, Nomura and Hull, negotiations continue to proceed through diplomatic channels. According to common sense, there is usually a period of considerable calm before a storm. However, the current situation between the US and Japan cannot be explained by this view alone.

The first thing that needs to be clarified is the fundamental position of the US Far East policy. Since the unveiling of the Stimson Doctrine of Non-Recognition to the present day, there have been countless changes and a long period of evolution. The recent activism displayed is probably something that the isolationists would never have dreamed of four years ago when their voices were at their loudest. However, the spirit of anti-aggression has remained consistent throughout, as has the sympathy for China and the vigilance and criticism toward Japan. When Wuhan and Guangzhou fell one after another, at a time when China's war effort was at its most disadvantageous, the US, in conjunction with Britain and France, issued stern notes warning Japan. Therefore, now that Japan's strength has been exhausted and the forces of the anti-aggression front in the Far East are flourishing, it would be unreasonable to say that the US would excessively accommodate the aggressor, or even that it would only be capable of employing a policy of appeasement. What the world still feels disappointed about regarding the US Far East policy is only that its steps are not active enough and its sanctions lack rigor, to the extent that it has not yet fully taken the initiative. The existence of these loopholes, it is believed, is not a momentary oversight on the part of the US authorities, but rather a deliberate arrangement to leave the aggressor some room for reflection and repentance amidst the increasing severity. After the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, there must have been thorough discussions and response decisions regarding the crisis-ridden Far East, and the Far East issue must have been one of the most important tasks of this meeting. In the event of a change in the future, it will be able to command and control effectively. However, at present, the US authorities are clearly not prepared to go any further than the current steps. On the one hand, this is based on the US's consistent stance of valuing the European situation over the Far East. At a time when the ferocity of the Nazis is still rampant, it is even more important to intensify support for Britain and the Soviet Union as the primary task. On the other hand, it is due to the belief that, under the current situation where interests are so clearly intertwined, allowing Japan to choose for itself will surely make Japan restrain itself and stop. At the same time, this is also the reason why the US has not refused to continue negotiations with Japan.

As for Japan, for the past few years, it has consistently taken the easing of relations with the US as the cornerstone of its foreign policy. Its emphasis on this is sometimes even greater than its alignment with the Axis powers. In the later period of the Second Konoe Cabinet, in particular, diplomacy with the US was regarded as the central task. After the establishment of the new Konoe Cabinet, although its actions have angered the US in many ways, its policies have sought to appease the US in many ways. For example, the deliberate display of leniency regarding retaliatory measures for the freezing of funds, the quick apology and compensation to the US for the Tutuila incident, the vigorous explanation regarding the evacuation of nationals dispute, asserting that they were not being detained as hostages, and the public declaration that it did not want any sensational evacuation of nationals to avoid arousing the emotions of the American people, all demonstrate an attempt at compromise. The Japanese Ambassador Nomura in the US has spared no effort in this regard. In addition, although Japan is eager to advance southward, given the failure and inability to end the war of aggression against China, it must cautiously avoid the outbreak of another war unless the timing is very favorable. Japanese Finance Minister Ogura once publicly stated that Japan is not yet in a position to be prepared for any eventuality and to provoke Britain and the US. Therefore, as long as diplomatic channels are not completely blocked, Japan will never easily give up the attempt to obtain practical benefits through negotiations.

However, the only point on which the US and Japan agree is that neither side wants an immediate armed conflict. If actual problems are touched upon, then the US demands that Japan leave the Axis, abandon its policy of aggression, and stop advancing north or south. Japan's hope is that the "New Order" will be recognized, aid to China will be stopped, and the build-up of military forces in the South Seas by democratic countries will be restricted. The two sides are diametrically opposed, like fire and water. Even if we take a step back and say that both sides may be willing to make concessions, they are still far from reaching a compromise. Moreover, the consistent national policies of the two countries have absolutely nothing in common. If a compromise were to be reached, it would certainly be even more fragile than the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact. Wise authorities like the US would never fail to see this.

Apart from subjective reasons, the reason why the US and Japan are still able to engage in negotiations is that the international situation is unfavorable to Japan, and the US is anxious to deal with the European situation. This is why the turbulent Pacific can superficially form a moment of peace. If the overall situation changes slightly—the most important thing being the Soviet-German war—whether it improves or reverses, this temporary balance between the US and Japan will inevitably collapse, and the overall situation in the Far East will have a clearer development.

Amidst the Evacuation of Nationals in Various Parts of the Far East, the Number of American Citizens in Free China is Gradually Increasing, Recognizing China as a Safe Place for American Citizens to Reside, Sufficient Proof that Americans Have Good Feelings Towards China

Chongqing – At a time when the issue of evacuating American citizens from various parts of the Far East is becoming increasingly serious, there are still 800 to 900 American citizens residing in the Free China area, which is frequently bombed, and they are not considering evacuation. In fact, not only do missionaries come to the Free China area, but also American technicians, medical advisors, and other representatives come to assist China's war efforts. The exact number of American citizens currently residing in the Free China area is unknown, but according to the registration of American citizens on January 1, 1941, there were 840 people residing in the Kunming consular district, of which 620 were adults. Approximately 520 were employees of various Chinese government agencies, 12 were American merchants, and more than a dozen were journalists. This number does not include the personnel on the US gunboat Tutuila, which has three officers and approximately sixteen soldiers. Americans traveling in China at that time who did not register with the consulate are also not included in this number. It is estimated that the number of American citizens will increase to around 1,000 by the end of this year, as American medical delegations for the Yunnan-Burma Railway, aircraft mechanics, ground personnel, and pilots of the American Volunteer Group, as well as transportation experts and technicians for the Yunnan-Burma Road, will all come to China. Currently, the routes through which American citizens can freely travel to and from China are the Chongqing-Hong Kong route of China National Aviation Corporation. The planes on this route fly specifically in hazy and cloudy weather, cross the Japanese battle lines at night, fly without lights for guidance, and have very few emergency landing fields. The secondary routes are through Burma, either via the Chongqing-Yangon air route or via the Yunnan-Burma Road. In the future, there may be air routes through northern Burma to India to supplement them. There is also a possible entry and exit route via Xinjiang and the Soviet Union, which has air and land routes, but so far, only a small number of journalists and embassy officials have used this route. Many American citizens have found an informal route, that is, from the Japanese-occupied areas and coastal ports of China, through the battle lines of both the Japanese and Chinese sides. However, only a very few people have come by this route, and no one is known to have left by this route. At the same time, although Chinese cities, especially Chongqing, have been bombed for the longest period of time, American citizens have not suffered any casualties, and they have the greatest confidence to continue living here. Their fears about the future are actually less than those of American citizens in other parts of the Far East. American citizens here feel that even if war breaks out in the Pacific, Free China is still a safe place for American citizens to live and work. The wives of American citizens working in Free China have not expressed opposition to coming to Free China, and if allowed, most of the American citizens residing in Free China would like to bring their wives here. This shows a glimpse of their feelings. (United Press correspondent Fess, 24th)

American Freight Transportation Experts' Suggestions Adopted by the Government, Yunnan-Burma Road to Accelerate Freight Transportation, Excellent Skills of Chinese Drivers

Chongqing – The American freight transportation experts who came to Chongqing a few days ago have departed for their country after inspecting the Yunnan-Burma Road. Before leaving, they made concrete suggestions to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on how to improve freight transportation on the road. It is reported that one of the suggestions is that the Chinese customs at the border between China and Burma should work day and night to accelerate freight transportation. Previously, the customs only inspected goods during regular office hours, which resulted in vehicles and trucks arriving after office hours being delayed. Reuters has learned that the suggestions have been adopted by the Chinese government. After the new rules are implemented, freight transportation through the border will be continuous for 24 hours a day. Mr. Arnstein, the leader of the group of American experts, told his friends here that the saying that the Chinese cannot drive is completely unfounded. Their excellent driving skills are no less than those of any other people in the world. It is also reported that after Mr. Arnstein and his group return to their country, a large number of American transportation experts will come to China to assist in supervising freight transportation on the Burma Road.

### German-Finnish Forces Jointly Attack, Leningrad in Critical Danger, Red Army North of Kyiv Crosses the River and Retreats West, Fierce Fighting in the Odessa Region

International News Agency, Berlin, 24th - Yesterday, German forces intensified their siege of Leningrad and Odessa to commemorate the first anniversary of the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and advanced to cut off Soviet troops heading towards the western coast. It is reported that the German-Finnish allied forces on the northern front are converging on Leningrad from all directions, with their vanguard less than twenty miles from the city. The German News Agency stated yesterday that German forces had defeated a Soviet cavalry unit, achieving a major victory. This cavalry unit initially attempted a counter-attack but was immediately surrounded. It is reported that over four thousand Soviet soldiers were annihilated, and over three thousand one hundred were captured. The agency also stated that the vanguard of the Finnish forces advancing in the Karelian Isthmus had crossed the old Soviet border, attacking the rear of the Soviet base of Vyborg. However, the German side acknowledged that Soviet resistance on that line was particularly strong.

United Press, Moscow, 24th - The Soviet-German war has entered its ninth week. The main Red Army seems to be resisting the fierce German attacks on Leningrad, but Soviet leaders acknowledge that the northern city is in a dangerous situation. Soviet forces continue their strong resistance, countering German forces 75 miles southwest of Leningrad at Kingisepp and 120 miles south at Novgorod. On the Smolensk front, the Soviet offensive on the road to Moscow seems to be making progress, with German forces pushed back considerably. There is no new news regarding the battle of Gomel. The fierce battle in the Odessa area is currently at a stalemate, with Soviet forces heavily damaging the attacking Romanian troops. Neutral military experts say that Odessa is only surrounded by land, and sea routes are still open. The Red Army has ample supplies and materials, enabling it to sustain its fighting in the bend of the Dnieper River. The German claim of crossing the bend of the Dnieper River has not yet been verified here.

Reuters, London, 24th - Moscow Radio broadcasted a Soviet communiqué yesterday at midnight, stating that on August 23rd, fierce fighting continued across the entire front, especially in the Kingisepp, Smolensk, Novgorod, and Odessa areas. In the aerial battles of August 21st, nineteen German aircraft were shot down, with the loss of seventeen Soviet aircraft.

German forces operating in Estonia are pressing towards Tallinn, and Finnish forces continue to advance along the coast of Lake Ladoga.

United Press, London, 24th - News from the eastern front yesterday stated that the Soviet-German war is being conducted on a large scale. Berlin announced that German and Finnish troops have advanced towards Leningrad, preparing for a "destructive offensive," and that German forces are advancing on Odessa, charging Soviet positions with bayonets. However, both Leningrad and Odessa are still in Soviet hands. The fiercest fighting is concentrated on the Dnieper River front, extending approximately 800 miles from the Black Sea to the Gomel area. The German side claims to have breached the Soviet defense line, completing contact with Nazi troops in Ukraine. Soviet troops continue to mount fierce resistance in Ukraine west of the Dnieper River. Neither side has disclosed the exact locations of the fighting.

### Central Red Army Launches Counter-Offensive, Recaptures Nine Towns and Villages in Two Days

Reuters, London, 24th - A Reuters dispatch from Moscow stated that Soviet forces are launching a counter-offensive in the central sector of the front, retaking nine villages in the past twenty-four hours. Although the German side has rushed reinforcements with tanks and artillery, the Soviet forces remain in an offensive position. According to the latest dispatches from the front, the Soviet counter-offensive is still progressing, with fierce fighting continuing. The German 161st Infantry Division has suffered heavy casualties in the past few days. General Konev's troops have captured fourteen artillery pieces, seven light artillery pieces, three tanks, six vehicles, and other light military equipment in forty-eight hours up to Friday. The nine villages retaken by the Soviet forces mostly have fortified positions, but the Soviet forces retook them in less than forty-eight hours, forcing the German forces to retreat westward. Soviet artillery and air forces are actively bombarding German tank forces. On August 21st, Soviet forces used heavy bombs to bomb German vehicles, artillery positions, and infantry units six times, destroying multiple German tanks and six artillery positions. In addition to General Konev's counter-offensive in the central sector, the German rear has also been repeatedly attacked by Soviet cavalry. Reports from all sides confirm that the Soviet troops who are resisting the German advance on Leningrad in the north and fighting in the Gomel area have strong morale.

### Intense Battle for Odessa, Germans Claim to Have Occupied Important Strongholds

Reuters, Berlin, 24th - According to the German official news agency, the battle for Odessa is currently extremely fierce. German infantry surrounding the port have captured very important strongholds. Two railway stations have been captured by German forces in hand-to-hand combat. Aided by Romanian tanks, German forces are advancing on Soviet positions, breaching their defensive line at a certain key point. Two Soviet transport ships west of Crimea were destroyed by German aircraft. The news agency also stated that in the central sector of the front, German forces engaged Soviet cavalry, with 4,000 Soviet soldiers killed and 3,150 captured, while 1,730 Soviet war horses were also seized. German aircraft have repeatedly attacked Murmansk in the north, with many hits on its docks, factories, and warehouses, while Soviet railways in the central sector have also been bombed by German aircraft.

TASS, Moscow, 24th - On the southern front in the Odessa area, the Red Army has inflicted heavy damage on Romanian troops. After fighting, some Romanian divisions only have 20% to 25% of their manpower left. The Romanian army has also suffered heavy material losses. Some divisions have lost 60% to 80% of their machine guns, and their anti-tank guns have been completely destroyed. This is the situation for the Romanian 15th Division. From the 10th to the 17th, our army's repeated counter-offensives were effective. As a result of one week of fighting, the Romanian 15th Division was completely crushed.

### Germany Eager to Make a Show Before Winter, Controls Waterways to Facilitate Prolonged Defense

Reuters, Stockholm, 24th - Local newspapers citing Berlin dispatches state that the German side now claims that its goal in the Soviet war is the long line along the Dvina River and the Volga River from Arkhangelsk to Astrakhan. After reaching this front, it will build barracks for a long-term defense in anticipation of next spring. Once the Soviet side loses this waterway, it will rely solely on the Siberian Railway for transportation. However, it is not something that can be accomplished in a short time for the German army to reach this front, as its offensive on Murmansk has not yet extended beyond the Riga River, and Leningrad and Moscow have not yet been captured. It is also said that General Budyonny's Soviet forces will defend the line east of the Dnieper River. The general opinion is that the purpose of the battle of Gomel is clearly to advance on Moscow. Finnish forces now claim to have occupied Kokkoselkä and controlled the entire bank of the Vuoksi River, 80 kilometers from Leningrad. It is expected that Finnish forces will advance in order to encircle Vyborg. It is reported that German forces are currently trying to resolve the Soviet forces that have retreated to the Prebellochye wetlands, but judging from the current situation, the Soviet forces have crushed this alleged German attempt.

### Second Anniversary of the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact

United Press, New York, 24th - Two years ago yesterday, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a treaty stating that for ten years, the two countries would not engage in armed conflict or mutual aggression, including not joining other countries in aggressive treaties, either individually or collectively. Article 5 of the treaty stated, "If any disagreement arises between the signatory countries, the two countries will adjust their disputes independently and mutually with friendly attitudes or views. If deemed necessary, an arbitration committee may be formed to mediate." German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and thirty-two aides flew to Moscow at the time to sign the treaty, with a major ceremony held, and the Swastika flag and the Red flag were displayed together for the first time. The Nazis in Berlin believed that Britain and France were "willing to be inferior to the Kremlin" and were no longer able to "encircle" Germany. The two countries simultaneously announced the treaty on August 31st. The next day, Germany invaded Poland, and on September 3rd, Britain declared war on Germany. One year ago yesterday, German newspapers stated that "the German-Soviet agreement indicates peace in the East," and another German newspaper stated, "This agreement makes a German-Soviet war impossible." In January of last year, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a friendship treaty, the content of which was based on the facts that occurred after August 23, 1939. On May 1st, a German spokesman stated that German-Soviet friendship remained "unchanged," but on June 22nd, Germany launched an attack on the Soviet Union. The great war between Germany and the Soviet Union has erupted, and as of yesterday, the war has entered its third month.

### Commander-in-Chief of Romania Promoted to General

Reuters, Berlin, 24th - The German official news agency's dispatch from Bucharest states that Romanian Commander-in-Chief Antonescu has been promoted to Romanian General.

### Britain Refuses to Release War Materials, Soviet Union Expresses Dissatisfaction, Orders in the United States Will Be Delivered After Six Months, British Forces' Wait-and-See Attitude Is Particularly Bizarre

United Press, London, 24th - Yesterday, news here stated that the Soviet Union expressed dissatisfaction with Britain's refusal to grant priority to the Soviet Union for the release of American war materials. The Soviet Union is also deeply puzzled by Britain's decision not to send an expeditionary force to launch a pincer attack on Germany from the European continent.

Reuters, New York, 24th - According to news from American newspapers, the Soviet Union is currently ordering war materials in the United States for delivery next spring in preparation for a long-term war. These orders will not be fully delivered until after eight months, indicating the Soviet Union's long-term war plans. There is also one thing that is most interesting, which is the Soviet Union's preparation for transporting tanks by air. The Soviet Union has now announced that all of its transport aircraft are larger than the American Douglas aircraft and can carry tanks weighing up to fifteen tons. The Soviet Union is not only preparing for the war eight months from now but will also adopt an offensive strategy. This further shows that the German claim of annihilating the Soviet army is completely inaccurate.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 24th - According to the Asahi Shimbun last night, a dispatch from Los Angeles stated that multiple American and Soviet oil tankers may be escorted by American destroyers and Soviet warships and aircraft to Vladivostok to prevent attacks from the Axis powers. It is also learned that one Soviet oil tanker in the Black Sea and one American oil tanker in San Pedro loading aircraft fuel may also sail to Vladivostok.

United Press, Washington, 24th - A member of the administrative authorities stated yesterday that the oil industry has been requested to provide another one hundred oil tankers to Britain. He said that a senior British official learned that the United States had directly transferred eighty oil tankers to Britain in the early stages of the war, about half of which had been sunk. However, the Maritime Commission stated that only forty-one oil tankers had been transferred.

### Soviet Union Solemnly Denies Preparing for Chemical Warfare

TASS, Moscow, 24th - The Italian Stefani News Agency and the Hungarian Radio Station, under the instructions of Berlin, falsely claimed that "the Red Army is preparing to conduct large-scale chemical warfare," and said, "This has been confirmed by Soviet prisoners from the Ukrainian front." This is a malicious and provocative fabrication that is completely inconsistent with the facts and absolutely inaccurate.

### Mexico Retaliates, Closes German Consulates

Reuters, Mexico City, 24th - The Mexican government has withdrawn recognition of all German consuls residing in Mexico. According to official announcements, this action is in response to the German order to close all Mexican consulates in France. The Mexican government's official statement strongly emphasizes that Mexico does not recognize the situation currently caused by violence in Europe.

Havas News Agency, Capital of Haiti, 23rd - Officials recently announced that our country has decided to close the German consulate "due to domestic and international reasons." As for our consulates in Germany and its occupied areas, they will be closed automatically.

### Anti-German Sentiment Runs High in Belgium and Norway, Belgian People Suffer Greatly from Abuse, Leopold Refuses to Regain the Throne

Reuters, London, 24th - According to Geneva news transmitted by Moscow Radio, Germany has twice proposed to King Leopold of Belgium to restore him to the throne in order to quell the anti-resistance trend in Belgium, but Leopold has refused.

Reuters, London, 24th - According to Moscow Radio, the Germans in Belgium, unable to recruit Belgian volunteers to go to the eastern front, have become enraged and are conducting large-scale arrests. Young men in Mons and other towns have been listed, and houses have been searched. The Germans have even planted anti-Nazi propaganda in Belgian homes as an excuse for arrests. Many people were arrested while asleep at night and sent to concentration camps. Although the Germans have used threats and violence for days, the number of volunteers is still very small. These few Belgian volunteers have been given uniforms and equipment by the German side and transported to Germany to be transferred to the front. Some people gathered at the station and loudly cursed these volunteers, and several women stepped forward and slapped their faces directly.

Reuters, London, 24th - The Norwegian News Agency here received news from Norway stating that the German authorities in Norway not only find it difficult to manage the Norwegian people but also have trouble dealing with their own soldiers. German soldiers often take the opportunity to desert, as can be seen from the German commander's notice posted by the Kitering local police. It stated that residents must not allow deserting German officers to reside, provide them with food, clothing, or other assistance. If deserters are found, they should be immediately reported to the nearest police station. Those who do not comply will be punished under German military law. According to news from the Swedish border, forty German soldiers abandoned their weapons and fled into Sweden after hearing of the German attack on the Soviet Union.

### Part of the Slovak Army Defects, 30,000 Have Been Sent Back

Reuters, London, 4th - According to foreign official news from Zurich, of the 40,000 Slovak troops that Germany transferred to the front for combat, 30,000 have already been sent back, and the remaining portion is not being used on the front lines. The Commander-in-Chief of the Slovak Army has returned to Bratislava, and his issued communiqués have ceased. Although the newspapers under German control are propagating that Germany was forced to take this step because the Slovak army lacks training in mechanized warfare, the real reason is that a regiment of the Slovak army has defected and surrendered to the Soviet army, and other parts are fleeing whenever they have the chance.

### Beaverbrook Returns to England from the United States

Havas News Agency, London, 23rd - British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook has recently returned here from the United States.

### Soviet Union Proposes Establishing Business Relations with Chile

Havas News Agency, Capital of Chile, 23rd - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced that the Soviet government has recently proposed establishing business relations with Chile. This proposal is currently being carefully studied by the government and a decision will be made soon.

### Mobil Oil Factory Suddenly Explodes

International News Agency, Paulsboro, New Jersey, 24th - The Mobil high-octane gasoline plant here suddenly exploded and was damaged yesterday.

### British and Soviet Troops Increase Border Defenses, Situation in Iran Remains Serious, If Demand to Expel German Nationals Is Firmly Rejected, Britain and the Soviet Union May Take Military Action

International News Agency, London, 24th - London is showing considerable tension over the growing crisis in the Near East. If Iran does not heed the British and Soviet demand to expel the German Fifth Column, senior officials here are even anticipating that military action will be taken soon. The Sunday Express declared that the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, has requested the Turkish government to allow Nazi technical units to pass through Turkey to Iran. Travelers from Iran spoke of about thirty Soviet divisions concentrated on the Iranian border. However, British officials neither confirmed nor denied this.

Havas News Agency, Capital of Turkey, 23rd - Regarding the ultimatum presented by Britain, the Iranian government has submitted a reply. It is rumored that its content is to allow German technical personnel to be reasonably dismissed after their service contracts expire, but it is unwilling to immediately expel all German nationals and risk breaking off relations with Germany. At the same time, the Iranian government has made urgent defensive deployments and summoned 1,072 reserve officers to enlist and serve in the border military districts.

Havas News Agency, Capital of Turkey, 23rd - Britain previously sent a note to the Iranian government, giving it until the end of this month to expel all German people from the country. It is learned that this deadline expired on the 19th of this month. People from all walks of life do not believe that the Iranian government can accept this request, at least not in this way. Currently, the Iranian government is waiting for the British side to respond to the reply. In addition, it is learned that British troops are currently concentrating in the border areas of Iraq and Iran, and a large number of reinforcements are being sent from Syria.

Reuters, Cairo, 24th - The situation in Iran remains serious. It is rumored that the Iranian reply, which is currently under consideration in London, has failed to improve the situation. However, Iran has made a concession to Britain, which is to stop the activities of the Rashid Ali faction, which is actively promoting cooperation with representatives of the Axis powers. It is estimated that there are 3,000 Germans in Iran, but the Iranian government only admits to 690 German nationals. It is likely that the Iranian government is not fully aware of the extent of German penetration, because many Germans bribed officials upon entry without reporting their entry, so there is no way to verify them with the central registry. The secret entry of Germans has increased the Axis powers' threat to Iran. Germany is eager to repeat the internal collapse tactic in Iran that was not successful in Iraq. A look at the map shows the severity of this threat. If Germany occupies Iran, it can endanger the Caucasus, India, Iraq, and the Persian Gulf, and affect the future oil supply to Iran and other places. Egyptian public opinion all leans towards the Allied powers, so they do not sympathize with Iran's support for the Axis powers. Iran is the Shia sect in Islam, while Egypt is the Sunni sect.

Iran's Policy Adheres to Neutrality, People Willing to Back the King

Reuters, London, 24th - The Iranian capital said last night via radio that the whole country of Iran is now supporting the King, willing to obey his will and take any necessary actions for the benefit of the country. Iran's policy has always been strict neutrality. Whether in peacetime or wartime, the King's policy is to improve the domestic social situation and not interfere in foreign disputes. Turkey has an understanding attitude towards Iran, which is greatly appreciated, because Turkish newspapers call Iran's current policy wise. Iran's wishes are concentrated on improving the status of its people.

### Franco-German Cooperation Negotiations Intensify, Vichy Decides to Take Harsh Measures to Wipe Out Domestic Terrorists

Havas, Paris, 23rd - Local newspapers recently carried news from Berlin that the German Foreign Ministry has confirmed that negotiations between France and Germany have been very active in recent days. However, political figures remain silent about the subject of the negotiations, only saying that these negotiations are commonplace and have been held periodically since the signing of the Franco-German armistice agreement, and have never been interrupted.

Havas News Agency, Capital of Switzerland, 23rd - According to a dispatch from the Berlin correspondent of the Journal de Genève, rumors are spreading that a compromise may be reached in the European war, and that there are talks of Germany and France concluding a peace treaty. The German Foreign Ministry has denied these rumors, saying that the Franco-German armistice agreement is the only treaty between the German government and France. As long as Germany is at war with Britain, this treaty will remain in effect. However, contact between Germany and France has been frequent recently, and the Wiesbaden armistice commission signs various measures related to cooperation between the two sides almost daily. In short, what the armistice commission is most concerned about at present is the security of the French Empire and its industry.

Reuters, Vichy, 24th - The Vichy Cabinet held two meetings yesterday, and then the Minister of the Interior hosted French and foreign journalists, discussing various domestic issues. His remarks will be broadcast at 6:00 PM today. According to Lyon Radio, the Minister of the Interior reported to the Cabinet on the plan he had adopted to deal with Communist schemes and sabotage and terrorist acts. The Cabinet decided to draw up specific measures to remedy the social situation caused by economic withering and lack of raw materials.

Havas News Agency, Vichy, 23rd - The French government has decided to severely crack down on the activities of the Communist Party and anarchists in the free zone and occupied zone. "Special courts" have been established in all military and ordinary courts to try such cases. All offenders will be severely punished, and those with serious circumstances will be sentenced to death and executed immediately after sentencing, with no right of appeal.

Haitong News Agency, Paris, 24th - Military authorities issued an order on Saturday stating that anyone who commits unlawful acts against German soldiers will be severely punished. On Thursday, a German soldier was assassinated in Paris. All arrested French people will now be held as hostages. If the same situation occurs again, part of the detained French will be executed.

Haitong News Agency, Paris, 24th - Paris Police Chief Bate issued a declaration yesterday expressing his loyal cooperation with the German defense forces. At the same time, he said that communism in Paris could easily be completely wiped out.

Havas News Agency, Paris, 24th - Late yesterday night, someone strung an iron cable across the street in Pont-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris. A German military vehicle then drove at high speed and crashed into the cable, completely destroying the vehicle. All the people in the vehicle were injured.

### The Mystery of the German Ambassador to Turkey's Whereabouts: Inaccurate Claim of Return to Berlin

Berlin, 23rd (Havas News Agency) – Rumors that the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, had already returned to the country to report on his duties and is now in Berlin have been denied by the Foreign Ministry. However, the ministry did not specify where Ambassador von Papen is currently located.

London, 24th (Reuters) – According to an unconfirmed dispatch from Moscow, the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, refused to accept the order to return to Berlin and demanded guarantees for his personal safety. His counselor, Kroll, has departed to Berlin in his stead. German officials in the Turkish capital attach great importance to Kroll's trip.

### The Duke of Kent of England Arrives in New York and Will Meet with the U.S. President Immediately

New York, 24th (Reuters) – The Duke of Kent, the younger brother of the British King, arrived here yesterday from Canada for a five-day visit. He will visit the U.S. President.

Hyde Park, 24th (International News Service) – President Roosevelt and his family yesterday hosted the Duke of Kent at their private residence. In response to inquiries, the President stated that the Duke's visit was entirely social in nature and had no international significance. However, the joint Anglo-American resistance axis may see further developments as a result.

Hyde Park, 24th (United Press) – The Duke of Kent will return to Washington with President Roosevelt and will be invited to a dinner at the White House on Monday.

### Government Incentivizes the Transfer of Funds Inland: Foreign Exchange Assets Can Be Unfrozen; The Bank of China Purchases Foreign Currency Drafts at Market Prices; Foreign Exchange Still Supplied at Market Prices for Legitimate Uses; American Overseas Chinese in China Can Exchange Funds for Legal Tender at Market Prices

Chongqing – Regarding the freezing of Chinese funds abroad by the British and Americans, how should the overseas deposits of Chinese nationals be unfrozen? How should foreign exchange needed by Chinese merchants be supplied? And how should it be made easier for American expatriates in China who hold foreign bank checks and drafts to exchange them for legal tender? These are all matters of concern to the public. An inquirer has learned from the Ministry of Finance that the spokesperson of the Ministry has issued the following statement: In order to incentivize the transfer of funds inland, the Chinese government will allow the Central Bank to unfreeze the foreign exchange assets of both Chinese and foreign nationals in the country. The measures are as follows: (1) If foreign currency drafts or bank deposit slips are brought to the bank for sale, the bank will purchase them at market prices. The price for U.S. dollars is 5 and 5/16 (i.e., 18.81 yuan of legal tender per U.S. dollar), the price for British pounds is 5 and 3/32 (i.e., 76.04 yuan of legal tender per British pound), the price for rupees is 17 and 1/2 (i.e., 5.71 yuan of legal tender per rupee), and the price for Hong Kong dollars is 21 (i.e., 4.76 yuan of legal tender per yuan). Personal checks must be guaranteed by a bank. (2) Individuals can transfer their foreign exchange to the bank and open a new account in the original currency. When withdrawing, they must apply in accordance with the procedures stipulated by the Ministry of Finance and will be paid in the original currency. As for merchants who need foreign exchange for legitimate purposes, the bank will still supply it at the aforementioned purchase market prices, but they must complete the application procedures and submit them along with the contract invoice, customs import certificate, or tax payment receipt, as well as a document from the relevant authority, to the bank for review. The imported goods must not conflict with the Ministry's regulations on prohibited imports. U.S. deposits held by American expatriates in China are also subject to freezing under U.S. law, unless otherwise stipulated by permit. Currently, American cultural, charitable, and religious undertakings in China, such as schools, hospitals, and churches, as well as Americans permitted to travel in China who hold U.S. dollars or letters of credit from American banks, have a great need for legal tender. In order to facilitate these institutions and individuals, the Ministry has also notified the Central Bank to accept their U.S. dollars or checks and drafts and exchange them for legal tender at market prices for their use so that they will not encounter any difficulties.

### Journey in the Southwest Sky (1) Hong Kong · Chongqing · Kunming · Lashio

The American "Collier's Weekly" recently published an article by Mrs. Hemingway about air travel, detailing her experiences on the way from Hong Kong to Chongqing, then from Chongqing to Kunming, and finally to Lashio. The author's writing is sharp and her observations are accurate. Readers will be able to appreciate it without further explanation.

Flying in Wind and Rain

It is 4:30 in the morning, and the cold wind is biting as passengers cross the sea to the Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon. The four sides of the airport are brightly lit, and you can see the silver Douglas DC-2 aircraft parked in the center, with large black characters painted on its wings. The English letters "CNAO" are on the right wing, and five-foot-square Chinese characters: "China National Aviation Corporation" are on the left. Around the airport are green mountains three thousand feet high, but you can't see anything in the dark. Eight passengers found their seats in the dimly lit cabin and fastened their seatbelts.

The weather forecast said that the pilot would ascend to five hundred feet with a visibility of two hundred miles, and that there would be thunderstorms ahead. This is good flying weather for the China National Aviation Corporation aircraft. American airlines never allow aircraft to fly out of airports surrounded by four mountains in this kind of weather. We started to take off, and the aircraft body slid and swayed in the wind. We will fly over Japanese positions at night, crossing mountains with a height of nine thousand two hundred feet. If we are forced to land due to adverse conditions, there are no plains here for landing. The distance to Chongqing is seven hundred and seventy miles.

The aircraft circled upwards, flying high above the safe area of Hong Kong. The city of Hong Kong gradually became smaller, becoming a crescent-shaped island below us. The mountains surrounding the port were flickering with lights. There were brightly lit ships in the port, and the flickering lights of civilian ships. The DC-2 aircraft gradually ascended, and the light from the city and the water became tilted and jumping. Then Hong Kong disappeared from view, and the aircraft was surrounded by white clouds. The Chinese passengers covered themselves with blankets and sat quietly in their seats, dozing off. You can hear the sound of the aircraft moving forward, and you can hear the howling wind. We have ascended to thirteen thousand feet above Hong Kong. The red and green lights on the wings were now turned off.

Now the aircraft is in the dark high altitude, and the flashing light of the gas emitted from the tail illuminates the drifting clouds around it. The shape of the clouds has changed, they are not sparse and soft; the structure of the clouds is like stone, rising in front of the aircraft like a wall, and the aircraft seems to be flying on the edge of a sandstone. The letters on the wings are blurred and eventually nothing can be seen. The aircraft is flying downwards in absolute darkness.

At five o'clock, we encountered a thunderstorm. Several Chinese people were still asleep. The weather was very cold, and an American military officer who was coming to China for the first time on this aircraft looked at us all with a wry smile, because there was nothing he could do. You naturally believe that nothing will go wrong with the aircraft. Once you are in the aircraft, you are part of it, and you must always trust it.

The DC-2 aircraft was vibrating in the storm, so we fastened our seatbelts again to avoid bumping into the two people in front of us or falling on the floor. Hail hit the wings and fuselage, making a sound like a threshing machine, and lightning flashed dimly in the clouds. You hold the chair with both hands, and support your body with your feet, so that you are sitting firmly on the chair. Thin ice formed on the engine and wings, and the aircraft gradually ascended. It has reached above the clouds. If it cannot reach the top of the clouds at an altitude of sixteen thousand feet, the pilot will have to fly back. There is no de-icing equipment on the aircraft.

An hour later, we had flown out of the storm area, but the surrounding clouds were still as thick as cream. The pilot ran into the cabin to tell the American military officer that the airspeed indicator was frozen in the storm. The American military officer smiled, nodded, and shook hands with him. The pilot said that fortunately, it didn't matter; he pushed the window open an inch and looked at the speed of the wind to measure the speed of the aircraft. He often tried this measurement.

On the Way to Chongqing and Yunnan

The aircraft was circling in the air, preparing to land. Although the ground could not be seen at this time, the visibility in Chongqing was now two hundred and fifty meters. For the convenience of blind landing, the China National Aviation Corporation pilots used German-style direction finding radio. This type of radio wave can automatically adjust the frequency of the transmitter to match the frequency of any long-wave radio station, so that the longitude and latitude are known to what degree. The coil of the direction finder can be rotated in any direction, and the degree on the inspection compass can be known in this direction.

But all the passengers suddenly saw a river and a series of uneven brown mountains in the gaps of the clouds. The pilot slowly rotated the aircraft and descended. The surrounding clouds had disappeared. We were very close to the ground, and we could see clothes drying in the square, the ruins after the bombing, and thousands of Chinese people walking hurriedly on mountain paths or streets. Chongqing looked like there were many scattered rural villages, distributed in a circle of mountain valleys, with the emerald green and brown Yangtze River flowing in the center. We were flying over the roofs of houses, over the Yangtze River, and were about to land at Chongqing Airport. The Chongqing Airport is 1,900 feet long and 100 feet wide and is located on a narrow island in the heart of the river, surrounded by mountains, all above 3,500 feet high. This island is submerged in water sixty feet twice a year, and in the best season it is like a mudflat in the Mississippi River.

In the afternoon, we drank tea at the Chongqing Airport, waiting for the weather report. We were about to set off to Kunming immediately, but the weather was too good. Everyone hated the clear sky and sunlight. In such good weather, Japanese aircraft could fly out of the Yue Liang base and attack Kunming. We still had to arrive at Lashio on the Burmese border tonight. The pilot Roy decided not to mind the Japanese aircraft bombing, and wanted to arrive in Kunming at dusk. Japanese aircraft would not drop bombs at night.

The fields seemed to undulate up and down the mountainside, and the shapes of the fields were different. From the air, we looked like strange flower petals. The crops were illuminated by the sunlight, and the fields were purple, gray, green, and yellow. We flew very low and saw everything. The weather was particularly good, and we could still enjoy the scenery. Roy said, "I picked what I thought was the more promising route." In order to suit the weather conditions, he created a new flight route. In fact, seventeen Japanese aircraft were prepared to fly back before we flew over Kunming.

Roy said, "You have to know that there is actually no place to land on this flight line." Looking down from the aircraft, you can only see crisscrossing paths, high mountains, and narrow riverbeds. Behind us, there is also an endless range of mountains. You can't see these when you are in the dark or passing through the clouds, but the mountains and rivers will always exist.

Looking north, the mountains are rocky and towering to the sky, and snow still remains on the peaks. To the south, there are endless mountains, continuous and a beautiful purple color.

Random Talks on the European War (76)

### Portraits of the Three Leading Figures of the British Cabinet

In addition to Prime Minister Churchill, the British wartime cabinet also includes three leading figures: one is the Minister of Supply, Lord Beaverbrook, who went to the United States this time to negotiate for armaments, one is the Minister of Labour, Bevin, and one is the Home Secretary, Morrison. They are introduced below.

Lord Beaverbrook is squatting at his desk, ready to jump up. After several months of his urging, his desk has become the focus of the world's attention. Most British cabinet members work in drab rooms with old desks and faded pictures on the walls. From the windows, they can only see blank walls of the Victorian era, palatial buildings, or dark squares.

Only the first Minister of Aircraft Production and the current Minister of Supply is different. His office is located in a high place, so he can see far and wide and overlook London. When he roars in a strange voice, "We must quickly get the aircraft into the air!" The solemn posture makes his words particularly vivid and powerful. He has only one posture when he speaks, raising his arms and shaking his hands, as if asking God to rebuke those who are hesitant and cowardly.

His right hand is shaking towards the window, and his left hand is hovering between four telephones, while his eyes are staring at an unexploded time bomb in the center of the desk. What kind of person is this Beaverbrook, who bears the heavy responsibility of building as many aircraft as possible?

He is completely different from what you might have imagined in the past. He has rewarded two cartoonists, Low and Strube, for drawing an old man who always grins grotesquely for many years. From his self-run newspaper, you can see his character, which seems to be crude and quick, having just run over from the Western Hemisphere, unfamiliar with British etiquette, but able to work hard. But millions of people still regard him as a "press eccentric," which is originally a contemptuous tone among the British.

First, he is not a small man. He is majestic in stature, as tall as five feet eight inches. He rarely grins, which damages his elegance, and he has a gentle temperament and is very handsome, so even though his voice is hoarse, it feels gentle and pleasant.

Although he comes from Canada, he is actually Scottish, but he was born in Canada. Even if he opposes this statement, it is a fact. He has not spent many years in Canada in his active life, but mostly in the United Kingdom and the United States. Although he was honored with the title of nobility, he has long regretted accepting it, otherwise he could have said in the House of Commons today, "Didn't I tell you all thirty years ago?" Originally, he had been elected as a Member of Parliament in 1910.

His experience has increased with age. The mischievous Max (Beaverbrook's nickname) has changed into Sir Beaverbrook, but this is not his first time participating in the cabinet. As early as 1918, he had already served as the first Minister of Information. This time, he was called by Prime Minister Churchill to join the cabinet again, after an interval of twenty years.

He has repeatedly tried to break away from the newspaper owner, but has not been able to fulfill his wish. He owns three newspapers, each with a different format. Those three newspapers are the "Daily Express," the "Evening Standard," and the "Sunday Express." Beaverbrook does not make them completely follow his own intentions. He is only a major contributor and leader, not a dictator.

For those who are competent, he does not hesitate to grant full authority in order to make the most of their talents. This policy has not changed to this day. Once, someone criticized him for expressing opinions that were different from the tone of his newspaper, and he replied, "Although I have read these newspapers, the words in them are not entirely written by me!" There was also a period when deliberately opposing his claims was the most reliable way, and the cartoonist Low achieved great success in this way. He satirized everything that Beaverbrook was fond of, even the sacred and inviolable imperial free trade was attacked in the same way. Many people still think that this is Beaverbrook's greatest and most amazing skill in running a newspaper.

From May 14, 1940, he has been sitting at the desk designated by Churchill. With his talent and knowledge, he may be able to determine the victory or defeat of the war. He sits at the desk, sometimes pondering, sometimes roaring. People in the outer corridors and passages talk about this minister in a respectful tone, just like they talked about his father years ago, but suddenly, this leading figure in the wartime cabinet will let out a shout, interrupting their conversation, he shouted: "My friends, I want to tell you what you should do, I want you to do it today, I want you to go to that factory right now, I want you to convey my words to them!"

Where is his secret? What is his job like? Did he succeed? Years ago, the cartoonist Low often painted Max as a "robber baron, wearing a coat, a wide-brimmed hat, with feathers inserted on it, and a short sword hanging from his waist. Beaverbrook liked this satire very much, so he hired Low. Now that he is sitting at the desk of the Minister of Supply, he looks just like a robber baron.

The situation of the British aircraft industry was very precarious at first. British aircraft, British designs, and British technicians and workers are the best in the world. But there is one major shortcoming: the number of aircraft manufactured is insufficient. Because about thirty aircraft companies are each acting independently, without any connection, and all manufacturing according to their own models. They don't seem to know that the whole world is in danger of collapsing, and they are all based on the "balanced production" of peacetime.

When Beaverbrook first arrived at Fleet Street "that is, London's newspaper street," he expressed contempt for "rabbit cage-style" rooms. At that time, newspapers were edited in dozens of small rooms, but Beaverbrook gathered all the editors into one room. When a newcomer comes in, they can't tell who is the editor-in-chief and who is the assistant. This is indeed not very comfortable, but it has great success where speed is needed.

Beaverbrook's first slogan after taking office as Minister of Aircraft Production was: "I don't want balanced production! I want to abolish balance! I want the manufacture of aircraft to be rapid! I don't want balanced production!" So this robber baron placed the aircraft industry on a unified basis. Since the Emergency Defence Act granted him power, he had great power and sent his subordinates to all parts of the country. Depending on the urgency of the need, he transferred aluminum from one factory to another, or took the aircraft frames and parts from one factory and handed them over to another factory that needed them more urgently. He soon applied the methods he used in factories to his subordinates. His methods were sometimes sincere, sometimes stern, and sometimes deliberately cunning, used in a mixed way, making it unpredictable, and even those who suffered the greatest blows had to endure with a smile, unless they flung their sleeves and left, otherwise they could only continue to work patiently.

According to his subordinates, the first slogan he shouted was: "We do not intend to eliminate the red tape in the department. We don't need to do this. We just have to step over this red tape without having to eliminate it." The first determination he showed when he took office was to reject all personal publicity. He told himself that his position was very delicate and he had to be cautious and self-protective (to be continued)

### The Application of Scientific Methods in Education Over the Past Forty Years - Academic Lecture Yesterday's Eighth Public Speech - Chen Xuan Shan, Director of Chinese Education Department, Gave the Lecture

The academic lecture initiated by the eight elders of this city held its ninth public lecture at the Majestic Theatre at 10 am yesterday. The lecturer was Dr. Chen Xuan Shan, and the topic was "The Application of Scientific Methods in Education Over the Past Forty Years." First, Mr. Zhu Xi Xuan delivered a speech on behalf of the chairman of the lecture series, briefly stating that the academic lecture series, at the request of various primary and secondary school teachers during the summer vacation, invited experts to lecture on various issues in education, winning public praise. Today, we are very grateful to Dr. Chen for coming to give a lecture. Dr. Chen is a famous modern philosopher and educator. He studied at Columbia University in the United States in his early years and obtained a doctorate in philosophy. After returning to China, he served as the dean of the Education Department of Great China University and as a professor at various universities. He is currently the director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. He has rich writings and profound knowledge. On this day, the audience who came to listen to his lecture was very crowded. Mr. Chen's explanation was thorough, and the listeners were all attentive. Mr. Chen first explained the meaning of scientific methods.

What is Meant by Scientific Methods

(1) Scientific method respects facts. The handling of any problem must be based on facts and must not be mixed with the slightest personal subjective bias. (2) The scientific method is analytical. It involves first analyzing a problem with complex content and broad scope into several small problems, and then solving them separately. However, this method sometimes falls into errors, because the analyzed items often cannot represent the whole picture. However, this is not entirely the fault of the analytical method itself, but rather whether its application is reasonable. (3) The scientific method tests objective facts to seek results and is not affected by personal interests or prejudices in solving problems. (4) The scientific method applies past experience to establish a hypothesis and uses a lot of data to prove the truth of this hypothesis. (5) Scientific method adopts quantitative methods to organize data. The description of each thing must be limited in degree. In short, the steps of the scientific method are to observe facts, establish a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, identify the problem, collect data, and then conduct subjective and objective considerations, and then collect new data for explanation, and finally find the correct theory.

The History of Application in Education

Next, the history of the application of scientific methods in education is briefly described. From the perspective of educational theories and systems, the application of scientific methods in education began forty years ago, around 1900. Taking children's education as an example, the first person to apply scientific methods to study children's education was an American educator, who published the research results of children's development in 1880. Later, some people studied psychological tests. By 1909, the development of educational tests had achieved great success. In 1898, there were also statistical methods in animal experimental education, which progressed very rapidly. In 1909, a famous educator, Aires, used statistical laws to study the problem of students repeating grades. In short, in the forty years since the scientific method was applied to education, it has made great contributions. Many achievements have been produced by scientific methods, and some traditional misconceptions have been overturned. The traditional concept that the learning ability of adults is not as strong as that of children has been overthrown. According to research and testing results, the learning ability of adults and children is comparable. Although the application of scientific methods to education may fall into the trap of being limited to formal training, it is only in this way that it can be improved. In short, scientific methods have made many good contributions to education over the past forty years, but we cannot be satisfied with this and must continue to seek progress.

Research Methods in Education

Next, it also mentioned "Research on Scientific Methods in Education," saying: (1) Use historical research methods to refer to past facts to improve various facilities in the future. (2) Investigating facts to serve as research data is the most practical need. (3) Paying attention to experimental methods is very ideal in theory, but in practice, because the process of education is extremely complex, and the people who use this method have not been completely rational, so this method has not yet seen any success.

Future Achievements Still Require Effort

It is said that, in summary, in the past forty years, scientific methods have enabled most people engaged in education to develop an objective attitude, so that they will not make hasty judgments on any problem, and what they say must be based on something. However, the research tools still need to be improved, and the scope of research should be expanded. Especially regarding the development of children, such as the stages of development of children's intelligence, there is still no unified conclusion, which is very regrettable. Furthermore, whether education belongs to science or not has not yet been concluded. Some say that education is not science but art. All of these are urgent problems that need to be solved and are quite interesting.

### Children's Library Changes Reading Time

The Shanghai Children's Library has decided to make slight changes to the original opening hours, as the various primary schools in Shanghai have now started one after another, which inevitably conflicts with the original opening hours, so as to ensure that children's extracurricular reading does not interfere with school hours. However, how to change it will be decided next week. In addition, the library's children's patrol reading has not yet been implemented. It is reported that it may be implemented next month.

### Shanghai Children Hold Singing Contest - Extended to September 14th

The Shanghai Children's Singing Contest organized by "Children's News," a high-quality domestic children's newspaper, has received enthusiastic participation since registration began. Many schools have also universally selected outstanding children to participate, in order to increase children's interest in singing. They have requested the newspaper to postpone the date of the event. It has now been decided to change it to the sixth floor of the New Shanghai Company on Nanjing Road on the morning of September 14th (Sunday), and the registration date will be extended to September 5th. Musicians Chen Gexin and others have been hired as judges. In addition, the combined issue of the newspaper, issues 64 and 65, was originally approved to be published today, but has now been postponed due to the city-wide printing strike.

### School News

Fangde Girls' School: The Fangde Girls' Primary and Secondary School at the intersection of Xibu Stone Road and Dumei Road has a long history and strict teaching. There are still vacancies. The secondary school department is scheduled to start on September 1st, and the primary school department is scheduled to start on August 25th.

### New Construction Middle School Benefits the Poor

The final enrollment is scheduled for the 27th of this month.

The New Construction Middle School at No. 310 Sima Road, which has been specially approved by the Ministry of Education, is famous in Shanghai for its perfect equipment and strict management. This semester, due to the addition of the second part at No. 46 Hartung Road, a large number of school equipment and instruments have been added, worth more than 10,000 yuan. Most of the hired teachers are graduates of famous universities in China and have rich teaching experience. Recently, the school has seen that the cost of living in Shanghai is increasing day by day. In order to help poor and studious students, in addition to the special donation of the Shenbao Scholarship at the second part of Hartung Road, a total of seven students from senior and junior high schools can be exempted from paying all tuition fees, which has been published in Shenbao yesterday. In addition, a number of free and half-price places for the poor and scholarships have been added to each grade to provide universal relief and benefit the scholars. The final recruitment has been scheduled for the 27th of this month. In recent days, students have been registering one after another, but the number of places in each grade is limited. Those who are interested in studying at the school should go to register as soon as possible.

### Re-estimating the Exchange Rate on the Foreign Exchange Black Market

— Zhang Liu

On July 26th, the United States ordered the freezing of funds from China and Japan, and Britain and the Netherlands also adopted parallel measures. After this information spread to Shanghai, most writers took it at face value, believing that this was an opportunity to eliminate the black market. The only reason was based on the interpretation of "freezing," believing that once funds were frozen, the buyer would have no way to sell them, and since trading was eliminated, the foreign exchange black market would naturally not exist. This was considered a gratifying thing.

Principles and Facts are Completely Different

However, in fact, transactions on the foreign exchange black market did not change due to the implementation of the freezing measures. At the same time, the foreign exchange market in Shanghai did not show any signs of "freezing." Therefore, almost all articles written based on the principle of freezing were completely wrong. Generally speaking, it is not a surprising thing that facts do not match guesses. However, under the topic of freezing funds, the mismatch between theory and facts is really not an error in the interpreter's understanding, but because there was fundamentally no "freezing" in fact. Since there was no "freezing," how could it affect the actual future development? Some people doubted why the black market continued to exist, and at the same time suspected that there was a reason why the black market could not be eliminated. Their misunderstandings all came from reason.

In this way, although the licenses of certain firms continued to be publicly displayed, the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai, in addition to speculators continuing to trade according to their own predictions, did not have any major changes. On August 18th, the Exchange Equalization Fund officially decided in Hong Kong to provide approved black market foreign exchange at an exchange rate of 5.34375 yuan to the US dollar. At the same time, it announced that to apply for foreign exchange, it was necessary to obtain approval from Hong Kong in accordance with the prescribed procedures. In this way, in the foreign exchange black market, there was a distinction between approved and unapproved foreign exchange. Those who were approved applied to the Exchange Equalization Fund according to the listed price, and those who were not approved went to the black market to purchase it themselves. Although the listed price remained at the original price this week, the actual transaction price in the black market still rose and fell according to supply and demand. In general, its exchange rate was tighter than the listed price. For example, on August 18th, the listed price of the foreign exchange black market was 5.3125 yuan, while the actual transaction price was 5.03125 yuan, a difference of 32.9 cents.

Exchange Equalization Measures Open Up One Side

There is no way to know the method adopted by the Exchange Equalization Fund for the foreign exchange black market, but based on the situation of the foreign exchange market, it can be inferred that the Exchange Equalization Fund's policy, as of now, is:

(1) Divide China's foreign exchange policy into two parts, one part is the rear, and the other part is Shanghai. The rear part is subject to strict foreign exchange control policy adopted by the Ministry of Finance, with an exchange rate of 7.5 yuan to the US dollar. The Shanghai part is responsible for the same approval system by the Exchange Equalization Fund, with an exchange rate of 5.3125 yuan.

(2) Although there is a listed price in the black market, because the United States has not actually frozen the funds, it is still allowed to buy and sell on its own. The market price of this transaction is the actual transaction price of the black market.

(3) The Exchange Equalization Fund still adopts a maintenance system for the transaction price of the foreign exchange black market (this estimate is based on the inexhaustible short position in the black market) and seeks its balance through buying and selling.

Therefore, the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai after the freezing can be said to be a relatively regulated control method. This method may be influenced by the British and American freezing measures, but it is not within the scope of the freezing measures.

In this way, although the foreign exchange black market has undergone certain changes in form, in essence, it has not changed in the slightest as a loophole in China. The reasons are as follows:

First, the so-called foreign exchange market is a concentration camp for capital flight and capital outflow, which is an undisputed fact. To block this loophole, it is necessary to adopt a strict foreign exchange control policy, at least to restrict the past free buying and selling methods; the freezing of funds, in principle, is likely to eliminate the black market, because if the funds can be actually frozen, the free buying and selling rights and movement rights of foreign exchange owners will naturally be subject to considerable restrictions, but now that the foreign exchange black market continues to exist, the foreign exchange loophole also still exists.

Second, the total sum of foreign exchange resources, whether flowing out of the rear or the black market, and whether paid on the Ministry of Finance's account or the Exchange Equalization Fund's account, its income is the entire Chinese foreign capital, and its loss is the entire Chinese foreign debt. The more resources that flow out of the foreign exchange black market, the less foreign exchange reserves can be maintained for the Shanghai black market listed price and the Chongqing commercial listed price. Therefore, the outflow on the black market is the same as the waste on the approval. In other words, the existence of the black market reduces the effectiveness of any control measures.

Third, based on China's foreign trade situation, the international balance of payments is in deficit rather than surplus. If this continues, the foreign exchange fund, no matter how sufficient, will have a day of exhaustion. To strengthen the strength of the foreign exchange fund, on the one hand, efforts should be made to suppress the consumption of foreign exchange, and on the other hand, the resources of foreign exchange should be increased. In terms of trade, in principle, a balance of imports and exports must be sought. In terms of quality, trade products must be classified and treated separately, so that the reduction of imports will not have a serious impact on the general national life. According to the future work and tasks of the Exchange Equalization Fund, there is no reason to listen to the existence of the black market.

The Key Lies in Politics

However, the foreign exchange black market still exists now. Some people think that this is the proper article for ending previous transactions, or that this is the precursor to the elimination of the black market, which are all wrong. The only reason is the phenomenon caused by the fact that the funds have not been frozen.

The general public overemphasizes aid to China in their understanding of the nature of the freezing measures, which makes them even more unable to understand this issue. The United States' freezing measures are essentially a kind of strategy towards the outside world. The main goal is to control Japan, and relatively, it is beneficial to China. Its side effects are to affect the exchange market. The freezing measures are not strict, not because British and American banks do not know the freezing steps, but to illustrate that the relationship between the United States and Japan has not reached a serious and decisive stage. If you think that the freezing was announced for the sake of the legal tender or the legal tender foreign exchange, it will make them even more misunderstood.

Although this is the case in fact, but from China's standpoint, since the United States has already been asked to freeze part of China's funds, in order to strengthen the effectiveness of this measure, it is necessary to request the implementation of freezing steps. Because according to the current method, although it has some impact on foreign exchange speculation, it has very little improvement in foreign exchange policy. As for leaving our intended goals, it is naturally even further away.

### The Aftermath of the Exchange Market

— Wu Shixian

As of now, what effect have the U.S. and British freezing of Chinese funds had? Not a single ideal result has been seen; there have been many unexpected results. The first is to create a black market within the black market of the exchange market. The second is to create an opportunity for further tightening of the already tight original black exchange rate.

Three Major Farces

Although it is said that the U.S. government has entrusted fourteen allied banks in Shanghai and four national banks in China to handle the review and supply, they are difficult to implement at present not only because there are no detailed implementation rules; and because the drafts that have not been reviewed can be bought as usual in Shanghai and can be collected and paid as usual in the U.S.; the emergence and existence of the black market within the black market is extremely natural.

Although it is said that the review system is being actively arranged, and the date of its realization may be imminent. But only doing review and supply, without a withholding freeze, will only cause the Exchange Equalization Fund to lose its funds. The newly generated export drafts that the Exchange Equalization Fund may obtain will instead become a supply resource for the black market within the black market. Even the drafts that the Exchange Equalization Fund supplies through review may inevitably become a supply force for the black market within the black market.

Although it is said that U.S. commercial banks only pay legal tender to foreign exchange depositors at the black price when they come to deposit and withdraw, and refuse to pay foreign exchange. But at present, this method only increases the degree to which demand exceeds supply in the black market within the black market. Moreover, interestingly, U.S. commercial banks still send these settled drafts to the black market in the exchange market for sale. And they must wait until the exchange rate in the black market within the black market is tighter than the price they gave before selling them. Therefore, it further strengthens the disadvantage of the tightening exchange rate in the black market within the black market. Without discussing its impact on the future of Sino-U.S. trade, just looking at this method itself, it seems to be a bit of a "only the state magistrate is allowed to set fires, but the common people are not allowed to light lamps" authoritarianism.

The Lowest Aftermath Method

Letting the black market exist means that the unification and stability of the exchange rate cannot be achieved, and even political goals such as preventing arbitrage become pipe dreams. Freezing and control should be as strict as possible, but now it seems to be increasing the negative impact of the loophole, which is certainly not a fundamental mistake. The problem is only that the farce is too high. Therefore, the first thing to do is to find a way to eliminate this farce, and the second is to pay attention to emphasizing the implementation methods of review and supply. The American and British members of the Foreign Exchange Exchange Equalization Fund Committee have already come to Shanghai one after another; and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has resumed its original activities since last week. We have many reasons to believe that the current farce

### News and Knowledge of the Bond Market (Continued and Completed)

— Notes by Mr. Zhang Yifan and Mr. Chen Jun

——Textbook for "Business News" at the School of Commerce, University of Shanghai——

Formula for Calculating Public Bond Interest:

Purchasing public bonds is an investment for individuals and a contribution to the country. However, the buying and selling of issued public bonds is merely the transfer of creditor's rights among bondholders, and does not contribute to the country's financial income. Therefore, to achieve the dual significance of personal investment and national service, one must purchase newly issued national public bonds.

Since China has had bonds and public bonds, a public bond market has arisen accordingly. During the Northern Expedition, the prices of various bonds were often only 40% of their face value. After the Northern Expedition, the national government sincerely reorganized, and creditworthiness improved daily, with market prices rising accordingly. As market prices rose, the discount on the issuance of new bonds could be increased, and losses to the national treasury could be reduced. Before the August 13th Incident, the Ministry of Finance, seeing the speculation in various public bonds and the soaring prices, had to implement a minimum price limit policy. It stipulated that Grade A bonds should not be lower than 76.0 yuan, Grade B bonds not lower than 73.5 yuan, Grade C bonds not lower than 71.5 yuan, and Grades D and E bonds should not be lower than 70.0 yuan. At that time, the market prices of various bonds were still 3-4 yuan to more than 10 yuan higher than this price limit. After the outbreak of the war, the stock exchange was ordered to close. Subsequently, a black market emerged. Initially, the unofficial trading prices of various bonds were almost halved compared to pre-war levels, but later gradually recovered. As of today, the pre-war situation has been restored.

Public bonds are not only a reliable investment target for the people but also an excellent way for financial institutions to manage their funds. This is because the bond interest rate is much higher than the deposit interest rate and is extremely reliable. If cash is needed urgently, it can be sold at any time, making it extremely convenient for circulating funds. Therefore, public bonds are often an important part of the payment reserves of various banks.

The unified bonds are currently scheduled to pay interest and principal once every January and July. Principal is repaid by lottery. Those who win the lottery receive the full amount of principal. Because various sectors of the city invest heavily in public bonds, each repayment of principal and interest often temporarily increases the amount of currency in circulation in the city. This is certainly not safe in today's speculative frenzy, so it has now been changed to pay the principal and interest in six installments each time. If funds are collected at the Ministry of Finance's location, a one-time payment can be made. In the month before each repayment of principal and interest, the market prices of various bonds tend to rise higher than usual. Once the repayment of principal and interest period has passed, on the first day of February and August, the market price is reduced by the interest due (i.e., three yuan). This is called ex-interest and should not be regarded as a change in the bond price. The method is currently being liquidated.

In reality, to eliminate the ridiculousness of the current freezing measures, there is only one path to take: telegraph the U.S. and British treasuries to immediately announce, "All import and export drafts to the U.S. and Britain that have not been approved for supply, regardless of their purpose or the issuing bank, shall not be cashed in the U.S. or transferred their creditor's rights within the territories of China, the U.S., and Britain. Any private transfer of creditor's rights will not only not be cashed in the U.S. or Britain, but we will also not recognize its legal effect." At the same time, announce, "In the future, all approved U.S. and British drafts should, in addition to the original signature, also bear the seal of the Sino-American-British Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. If there is no seal of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, it will be considered unapproved." If this method is implemented, then the drafts traded on the black market within the black market will all become waste paper. The black market within the black market will also disappear. And China's export drafts, even in the occupied areas where control is lacking, will not be afraid of not being sold to the market controlled by the Stabilization Fund. Therefore, the Stabilization Fund will also avoid repeating the mistake of only supplying without receiving. And the strengthening and effectiveness of the approval supply system will no longer be a problem.

Of the 209,502,167 yuan in agricultural loans outstanding at the end of 1940, the Farmers Bank of China had issued 96,741,000 yuan, accounting for 46.18%; the Bank of China had issued 51,350,000 yuan, accounting for 24.51%; the Agricultural Credit Administration (before its reorganization in October 1940) had issued 37,855,382 yuan, accounting for 18.07%; the Bank of Communications had issued 12,579,785 yuan, accounting for 6%; and the Central Trust Bureau had issued 10,976,000 yuan, accounting for 5.24%.

The total amount of agricultural loans for this year (1941), according to the Joint Administration of the Four Banks, is expected to reach 400,000,000 yuan. Several large agricultural loans have already been contracted, such as 136,000,000 yuan for Sichuan Province and 30,000,000 yuan for Shaanxi Province.

Regarding the issuance of loans in 1941, the allocation among the banks is as follows: the Farmers Bank of China is responsible for 45%; the Bank of China for 25%; and the Bank of Communications and the Central Trust Bureau for 15% each.

This type of agricultural loan can be categorized into agricultural production loans, agricultural supply and marketing loans, agricultural product storage and pledge loans, farmland irrigation loans, rural transportation equipment loans, tenant farmer land purchase loans, rural sideline occupation loans, and agricultural product promotion loans. The Joint Administration of the Four Banks is also handling agricultural loans according to the following guidelines: (1) promote the increase in agricultural production, land reclamation, and irrigation in the Great Rear Area, and promote handicrafts and small industries; (2) directly assist farmers' organizations and promote cooperative enterprises, establishing material-market cooperative finance; (3) strive for balanced loan distribution, simplify procedures, and adapt to agricultural seasons.

Future of Agricultural Commodities

Since the outbreak of the war, the Chinese government's active encouragement of agricultural loans can be proven by the increase in the aforementioned agricultural loan figures. The future progress of agricultural loans will undoubtedly advance along the government's established guidelines and improved pathways, which need not be elaborated upon. However, one point remains to be stated: since the establishment of new-style agricultural financial institutions in China, most have engaged in short-term loans, and few have engaged in medium-term loans. As for long-term loans, most avoid the important and take the light, looking away in disappointment. Examining the opinions of various experts, all believe that the path to China's agricultural development should focus on the government assisting tenant farmers in obtaining cultivated land and assisting small farmers in expanding cultivated land. Therefore, there is an absolute need to conduct long-term land loans.

At the beginning of this year, the Farmers Bank of China established a Land Finance Department, with initial capital of 10 million yuan. According to the person in charge of the department, its business policy is based on Sun Yat-sen's instructions regarding land policy. Its loan types are divided into six categories: (1) land acquisition at assessed value loans; (2) land consolidation loans; (3) land improvement loans; (4) land replotting loans; (5) self-cultivating farmer assistance loans; (6) land registration consolidation loans. From the types of loans, it can be seen that the government is already conducting long-term land loans, but the department's current capital is only 10 million yuan. To conduct the aforementioned types of loans, a large amount of capital is needed, and the amount of 10 million yuan is certainly not sufficient. Moreover, long-term land loans have relatively sluggish capital and even lower interest rates, so long-term, low-interest capital is needed for turnover. Regarding this, the Land Finance Department can issue bonds with land as collateral to obtain capital.

Examining the sources of China's agricultural loan funds, most come from nationwide financial institutions, accounting for 74.65% of the total. Local banks and farmers' banks in various provinces account for 11.59% in total. As for commercial banks, due to the nature of their business, they are certainly not suitable for conducting agricultural loans. However, commercial banks that also conduct savings business must, according to the provisions of the Savings Bank Law, invest one-fifth of their total savings deposits in rural areas. It seems that the savings deposits of various banks have not yet been fully implemented in accordance with the provisions of the law. As of the end of 1939, there were 70 commercial savings banks in China, and together with other banks that concurrently handle savings, there were nearly 100. The amount of savings deposits absorbed must be substantial. Therefore, the government should strictly supervise commercial banks handling savings business and banks concurrently operating savings business, ensuring that their pledge loans to rural cooperatives and loans with agricultural products as collateral, and the purchase of bonds issued by the Land Finance Department or national agricultural financial institutions, shall not be less than one-fifth of the total deposits. This will not only provide agricultural loan funds with a reliable and abundant source but also reduce the speculative business operations of general unsound banks.

If the aforementioned point can be implemented, then China's agricultural loan future will truly have infinite hope, and the development of agriculture will also be unlimited!

(Note) This figure is not the total for the entire year. The amount of loans recovered before the end of last year (1939) is not included in the statistics, nor are the agricultural loans that have been determined but not yet paid out this year (1940).

Commercial News

### Bamboo Joint Steel Bar Sees Rise

The bamboo joint steel bar market, which has been quiet for a long time, has been affected by the unpredictable changes in the financial market since yesterday. In addition, the construction trade on Wood Street has shown some activity. The market atmosphere has become active, and those holding goods feel that the prices are firm. The standard asking price has also risen accordingly. Yesterday, the 3-4 minute pattern was quoted at 3,350 yuan per ton, while the 5-minute to 1-inch goods were quoted at 3,300 yuan per ton, each rising by 50 yuan compared to the previous price.

### New Wire Rod Trading Difficult to Smooth

New wire rod, also known as raw silk, is the main raw material for manufacturing native nails. In addition, screw factories, lead wire factories, and machinery factories also occasionally purchase it, but the number is not as large as that of native nail manufacturers. Recently, the native nail market has been fluctuating, and overseas transactions are difficult to continue. The number of daily transactions is also not large, so the trend of its raw material (wire rod) is also difficult to reach its peak. The standard price is still quoted at around 250-260 yuan.

### Native Nails Hovering at 190 Yuan

Native factory-made nails are still being produced by factories in this city due to the obstruction of overseas transactions. Although users on Wood Street are tirelessly purchasing, there are quite a few holders releasing goods, so the circulation of goods feels more and more congested, and it is difficult to see the standard price rising. The sentiment among the industry is flat, and the market does not seem to be very lively. Therefore, the standard market price is still hovering around 190 yuan, while the price of American wire nails must be around 200 yuan due to the interruption of overseas supply.

### Black Steel Billets Showing Their Edge

2,000-pound black steel billets are being frantically searched for by thermos factories on Wood Street and are also affected by the soaring gold market. The market price is soaring, and the sentiment in the industry is extremely excited. The inventory of this product in Shanghai is not large, and the overseas supply has long been cut off. Those responding to the market are only relying on the spot goods on the market. Therefore, once the trend is good, it shows its edge. The standard selling price is rising rapidly. Yesterday, the market had already risen from 4,400 yuan to 4,600 yuan and is still continuing to rise. It is said that about 50-60 bundles were traded in the city yesterday, most of which were purchased by thermos factories and tin printing factories. It is expected that the market trend will be difficult to loosen in the future.

### American and Indian Cotton Fall Despite Volume

The New York cotton market is loose due to a lack of significant purchases and the liquidation of long positions, as well as short selling in the South. As a result, both futures and spot prices fell by 2 to 9 points or so compared to the previous day.

The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to sales by European exporters, then firmed slightly due to purchases by speculators, but ultimately weakened again due to the liquidation of long positions. As a result, the prices of various brands still rose by 1 rupee 25 to 4 rupees 50 or so compared to the previous day.

Also, the forecast opening price of Indian cotton today is slightly lower by 1 rupee 50 or so.

### Recent Opening Prices of Red and Jade Sea Cucumber

A batch of Western sea cucumber, brand number ..., has been opened. The quantity is small, and the market price of red sea cucumber is relatively high, while jade sea cucumber is still flat. For example, red sea cucumber is as high as 293 yuan, and the lowest is 179 yuan. Jade sea cucumber is as high as 566 yuan and the lowest is 289 yuan. The detailed market prices of each grade are listed below (market price per dan) (unit: yuan):

Commodity

Fat Large Jade 500 Selected Strip Red 293

No. 1 Jade 566 Large No. 1 272

No. 2 Jade 520 Rushed Again 248

No. 3 Jade 452 No. 2 Red 231

No. 4 Jade 379 No. 3 Red 197

No. 5 Jade 289 Medium Red 179

### Cigarette Prices Rising Sharply

Cigarette prices are rising like lightning because the foreign exchange settlement for consumables is prohibited, resulting in an extreme shortage of raw materials. Factories have no scheduled shipments, and the demand in this city and for external sales is very strong. Spot goods on the market are very tight, and the market is advancing frantically. The price of the Great Britain brand has soared to 2,160 yuan per case, Old Knife brand to 1,820 yuan, Five Flowers brand to 1,210 yuan, Little Fairy brand to 1,410 yuan, Fine Sea brand to 1,470 yuan, and the medium case of 10-piece Big Beauty brand to 1,090 yuan, Pyramid brand to 1,020 yuan, all rising by 50 yuan to more than 100 yuan compared to the previous prices.

### Matches and Candles Continue to Rise

The soap market is rising because of a lack of raw materials and no shipments from factories for a long time. Sales on Wood Street are prosperous, and hoarders are also starting to store up, so the purchase price is soaring. Gu Ben soap has risen to 61 yuan per case, Bai Xiang Mao soap to 51 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap to 47 yuan and 50 cents, and Arrow Knife soap to 50 yuan, all rising sharply by more than 3 yuan compared to the previous prices.

The market price of matches is rising even more sharply, mostly because raw materials are gradually becoming scarce, and sales and domestic demand are extremely strong. Those holding goods are supporting prices, and few are selling, so the sentiment is gradually trending upward. The purchase price is soaring. The Beautiful brand has risen to 1,000 yuan per case, and the Phoenix brand to 980 yuan, rising by more than 100 yuan. The market is creating unprecedentedly high prices.

The candle market is brisk because sales orders are stepping up actively, and the buying sentiment is also strong, so the price is rising. The Ship brand is 37 yuan and 70 cents per case.

### After Hall-Patch Arrives in Shanghai, Financial Conference Convened Yesterday, Making Important Decisions on the Management of Shanghai's Exchange Rates, Detailed Implementation Measures to Be Announced Soon

Mr. E. L. Hall-Patch, American member of the Chinese Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee and current British Far East Financial Advisor, arrived in Shanghai on the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s ship Yuesheng at 8:00 PM the night before last. Because the ship temporarily decided to anchor overnight at Woosung, it only entered the Huangpu River yesterday morning. Around 10:00 AM, the ship docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. After a while, Mr. Hall-Patch and his female secretary disembarked from the cabin and slowly walked down the ship, accompanied by those who greeted him, and went to the British Embassy at No. 27 The Bund to rest. He then gathered with the assistant Taylor and key personnel from Chinese and foreign banks at the embassy to discuss issues related to the Shanghai foreign exchange market. The meeting lasted for three hours. However, this was a preliminary review, and more thorough research and consideration will be conducted in the coming days to determine the exchange rate settlement plan.

Arrived in Shanghai the Night Before Last, Landed Yesterday Morning

The news of Mr. Hall-Patch's arrival in Shanghai from Hong Kong was initially revealed to reporters by the Four Banks the morning before last. The Yuesheng, which he was on, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 8:00 PM the night before last, but due to anchoring overnight at Woosung, it was delayed until around 10:00 AM yesterday morning before arriving at the Roosevelt Wharf. Dr. Taylor, the American assistant of the Stabilization Fund stationed in Shanghai, relevant responsible personnel from Chinese and foreign banks, and senior officials from the British Embassy all went to the wharf to greet him. Mr. Hall-Patch's cabin was No. 5 in the first-class cabin. He had one female secretary accompanying him. At 10:15 AM, Mr. Hall-Patch got off the ship with a smile, shook hands with those who greeted him one by one, exchanged brief greetings, and then took the British Embassy car to the British Embassy at No. 27 The Bund to rest. The responsible personnel from the relevant banks and Dr. Taylor all accompanied him.

Maintaining Shanghai's Legitimate Trade

Mr. Hall-Patch has long served as the British Far East Financial Advisor and is extremely familiar with China's economic situation. Since succeeding Sir Otto Niemeyer as the British member of the Stabilization Committee, he has contributed greatly to the decision-making of foreign exchange policies. This time, he was sent to Shanghai to supervise by the decision of the Stabilization Fund Committee's first meeting in Chongqing on August 16. On the one hand, it is to strengthen the connection between the Stabilization Committee and the Shanghai foreign exchange market, and on the other hand, to work with Dr. Taylor to study the most applicable exchange rate settlement method for Shanghai's special situation, in order to maintain legitimate import and export trade and complete the purpose of using the Stabilization Fund. In addition, Mr. Hall-Patch will conduct a specialized investigation into the currency situation in Shanghai and the surrounding occupied areas, in order to formulate a plan to consolidate the foundation of Chinese legal tender for the Stabilization Committee's reference.

Convening Meetings to Discuss Methods

However, the reason why Mr. Hall-Patch rushed to Shanghai within eight days was in response to the urging of Dr. Taylor, the American assistant stationed in Shanghai. The basic principles of exchange rate settlement agreed upon by Dr. Taylor and the relevant banks in Shanghai await Mr. Hall-Patch's participation and further planning. After resting briefly at the British Embassy at 10:30 AM yesterday, Mr. Hall-Patch invited Dr. Taylor and responsible personnel from HSBC, Citibank, Mercantile Bank, Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to discuss the specific plan for exchange rate settlement for essential goods in Shanghai. In addition to each bank reporting on the current situation, they focused on discussing the settlement of essential goods and the termination of settlement for luxury goods based on the established principles. The meeting lasted for three hours and only adjourned at 1:30 PM.

Discussed Content, Revealed Generally

Although the content of yesterday's meeting was kept strictly confidential, according to disclosures from sources close to the banking sector, the meeting's main agenda included five items: 1. How to divide the essential goods that should be supplied with foreign exchange into several categories according to importance. In addition to the important parts being fully supplied, what percentage of the applied amount should be settled for decisive and re-decisive parts? 2. How to assess goods that are not prohibited from import but are of a luxury nature. Under what circumstances should a part be supplied, and under what circumstances should the right to refuse the entire supply be given? 3. In terms of review, how to determine that the trade is in good faith, and how to investigate whether the amount applied for settlement is necessary for legitimate needs? 4. In terms of application procedures, what kind of guarantee is the most reliable and what kind of standard is the most applicable? 5. How to strengthen the control of the China and Bank of Communications over the exchange rate settlement of Shanghai exporters?

Detailed Measures to Be Announced Soon

The above agenda items were all discussed at yesterday's meeting, and a unified opinion was generally reached. As for the detailed implementation measures, they have been handed over to the Joint Office of the Four Banks to be drafted quickly based on the list of prohibited import goods announced by the Customs in July 1939, the list of goods allowed to be imported approved by the Executive Yuan in September 1940, and the resolutions of past meetings between Taylor and the banking sector. This measure will be officially announced in the short term. Because foreign banks have already supplied a portion of the foreign exchange needed for normal needs, but there is no definite method to follow, the announcement of the measure is indeed necessary as soon as possible. After this measure is announced, the Chinese and foreign banks designated by the general notice of the United States will all follow it uniformly.

Foreign Banks Cooperating Fully

According to sources currently in the industry, when Dr. Taylor convened responsible persons from designated Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai to discuss the exchange rate settlement method, there was a fierce debate. The British banks believed that they should replenish from the Stabilization Fund Committee the foreign exchange that had already been settled for non-essential essential goods. The opposite view was that this would have a significant impact on the consumption of the Stabilization Fund and could not replenish the full amount of the settled amount. Finally, after sincere mutual understanding, it was decided that in the future, before supplying applied foreign exchange, the consent of the Stabilization Fund Committee must first be obtained. Otherwise, in order to prevent unlimited consumption of the fund, it cannot be replenished. Foreign banks expressed acceptance and cooperation in this regard, so the foreign exchange management system will become more strict.

### Both the United States and Japan Continue to Take Measures to Evacuate Nationals, but Very Few Are Evacuated

According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the American President Lines will have a President ship arriving in Shanghai at the end of this month, carrying American nationals evacuated from this city, and returning to the United States via San Francisco. In the middle of next month, there will be another two President ships arriving in Shanghai, one of which is the President Harrison, a World-Class liner that left Shanghai on the 15th of this month and returned to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope. Most of the first and second-class cabins of the Dutch Java Line's Tjisarua have already been booked, and it is said that most of them were booked by British and American personnel, because it is more convenient for them to take this ship to the Dutch East Indies, transfer to Australia, and return to their countries. Because the situation in the Far East has not yet reached its most serious stage, the number of Dutch nationals in this city who intend to evacuate and return to their country is very small.

Japanese Nationals Continue to Evacuate from the Philippines

It is reported that another 160 Japanese nationals will evacuate from Manila to Shanghai on the French shipping company's ship Kaiting on the 23rd of this month. Of the 371 Japanese women and children who arrived in Shanghai on the French postal ship General Xiafei from Manila on the 23rd, 200 have decided to return to Japan on the Asama Maru, which will leave Shanghai for Kobe at 10:00 AM today.

Beautiful Writer Prevented from Leaving Japan

According to foreign sources, a group of 26 people, including officials from the American Consulate in Japan and officers from the Marine Corps, will arrive in Shanghai from Japan on the Tatsuta Maru on the 28th of this month. Among them, American travel writer Miss Green, who was also traveling with them, was suddenly refused a passport to leave Japan by the Japanese police authorities, so it is feared that she will not be able to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month. Miss Green has lived in Japan for two years and has written travel newsletters.

### International Council Allocates American Wheat to Relieve Northern Jiangsu

The counties of Northern Jiangsu, Jiangdu, Taixian, Gaoyou, and Xinghua, and the towns and villages under their jurisdiction, have suffered the most from the war. For example, Dinggou Tangtou in Jiangdu, Fanwen Xiaoji in Taixian, Yiergou Sanduo in Gaoyou, and Baiju Liuzhuang and nearby villages in Xinghua. Even the small houses of three or five families have all suffered terribly from the disaster. A total of 50 disaster areas, with a total of 38,000 households and 110,000 people, have not only had their houses and clothes burned to the ground after repeated looting, but also all the farming tools have been burned in the fire. Even the plowing cattle and rice seeds have been looted. Last winter, the government authorities, local charitable organizations, and fellow villagers in Shanghai and Chongqing have repeatedly tried to provide relief. Mr. Han Guojun, a respected elder from Northern Jiangsu, is extremely concerned. Recently, fellow villagers in Shanghai, including Bao Xiangzhong and Xin Zhixin, learned that the International Relief Council has some American wheat available for relief to war victims in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and has entrusted the Red Cross and Red Swastika Society to handle it. They asked to investigate, and if it was true, to provide a detailed account of the counties in Northern Jiangsu that were most severely affected and to request additional relief. It is reported that they have discussed this with Mr. Chen Zhenyan, Chairman of the Red Swastika Society in Chengdu, and Mr. Chen Mingfu, who is in charge of the Red Swastika Society in Qutang Town, Taixian, and have submitted a request for a report. It is now reported that the International Relief Council has agreed and approved the early release and that a transportation permit can be obtained.

### Most of the Printing Industry Workers Have Resumed Work

Since the strike by printing industry typesetting workers on the 12th, the representatives of both sides have been actively mediating for days and have agreed on a solution. The union is advising those employers who have signed and complied to resume work first. For those who have not signed, the trade association must be responsible and make a final effort to urge them. However, the labor side claims that this procedure must be completed within three days.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Will Establish an Advisory Committee for the Collection of New Taxes, Currently Consulting with the Consular Body on the Selection of Candidates, Approximately 16 or 17 Representatives from Various Countries

Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan to levy a business tax, the Finance Committee met on the 18th to review it and decided to amend the original plan. The name will be changed to Business Property Tax Special Surcharge, and it will be levied in two levels: Level A for offices, shops, warehouses, docks, etc., with a property valuation of 3,000 yuan or more, the annual tax rate is 8%; Level B for exchanges, with a property valuation of 3,000 yuan or more, the tax rate is 15%. The proposal will be submitted to the Municipal Council meeting on the 3rd of next month for discussion.

The Council is Consulting with the Consular Body

In addition, Japanese sources have reported that, according to the decision of the special taxpayer meeting in April of this year, when any taxes other than those stipulated in the regulations on the land along the Yangjingbang Canal are levied, the opinion of the Advisory Committee should be sought. In order to make a final decision on this case as soon as possible, the Council is negotiating with the Consular Body, requesting that the Advisory Committee be formed as soon as possible. The consuls general of various countries are currently negotiating the selection of candidates.

Awaiting Fessenden's Return to Shanghai to Discuss

The selection of members will be carried out after Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the Municipal Council, who is staying in the Dutch East Indies on summer vacation, returns to Shanghai.

### Auction of an Old "The Times" Newspaper by Mr. Asse Woods

A Publication from Over a Century Ago, Priced at Over 100,000 Yuan

Mr. Asse Woods, a broker from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, possesses a copy of "The Times" newspaper published in London over 130 years ago. It was auctioned off at the "Moonlight Drama Gathering" held at the Democratic Radio Station the night before last. Because the newspaper was published in 1805 and contains very detailed accounts of the Trafalgar War, it was auctioned publicly in the American style. The result was a bid of 103,150 yuan. Mr. Woods immediately donated the proceeds to the British War Relief Fund. In addition to this auction, another reprinted London "The Times," containing accounts of the Duke of Wellington's Battle of Waterloo, was also up for auction.

The final decision can be made, and the association will be formally established, with a membership of approximately 16 or 17 people, composed of representatives from various countries with authority. Once the association is established, the proposal to levy a special surcharge on business premises will be submitted for discussion.

Mid-September: A Decision Can Be Made

A general decision can be made around mid-September (as reported in yesterday's Japanese "Mainichi Shimbun"). However, when inquiring with a spokesperson of the Public Works Department about the reliability of the above news, it was stated that various committees of the Public Works Department had indeed discussed various plans to develop new sources of tax revenue, but the spokesperson was unwilling to disclose what resolutions had been reached in these discussions, as they had not yet been formally submitted to the Board of Directors. It was implied that various committees are currently studying several parallel plans, but which plan will ultimately be submitted to the Board of Directors for approval is not yet certain.

### Building Flood Defenses Along the Bund

Due to the impact of the high tide in the Huangpu River in recent days, low-lying roads have been flooded. Areas near the Bund, such as Museum Road and Hong Kong Road, have also been inundated by tidal waters, turning them into watery lands, demonstrating the severity of Shanghai's flood problem, which deserves serious attention. According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the Public Works Department is actively carrying out flood control work. Currently, check valves have been installed in sewers at Henan Road and along the Bund to prevent backflow, and concrete flood barriers are being built along the Bund. At Zhejiang Road, Nanjing Road and other locations, backflow prevention valves have been installed in sewers and workers have been assigned to manage them, and the situation is relatively good. Unless there is a high tide of more than eleven feet, or a combination of rainwater, it should not flood the roads.

### Transit Visa Procedures for Burma and Hong Kong: Handwritten Signature Required on Passports for Burma; Two Important Points for Applying for Hong Kong Entry Permits

With Hainan Island occupied, Zhejiang and Fujian blockaded, and Vietnam forcibly garrisoned with troops, the routes from Shanghai to the mainland have been cut off. Fortunately, the Yunnan-Burma Road has reopened, and although the journey is long, there is still one route available. Therefore, the Shanghai-Rangoon air route has recently become a major transportation route. It is also understood that Guangzhou Bay is still accessible to the mainland, but the procedures for entry permits and visas for both places are relatively complicated. The details are recorded below.

Burma Visa: Validity Period Required

(1) Procedures for Burma visas: (A) The passport holder must sign their name in their own handwriting in the "Signature of Bearer" section on the seventh page of the passport; otherwise, they will be refused landing or detained. (B) When applying for a transit visa from the British Consulate, applicants should request the British Consul to specify the length of stay in Burma, such as one or two months. If the validity period is not specified, they must leave Burma within two weeks of arrival. Those who fail to leave within the specified period will be warned and fined two to three hundred rupees. If they still remain, once discovered, they will be subject to three months of detention. (C) According to the China Travel Service's Rangoon communication of July 25, "Travelers coming to Burma, whether for transit or entry, must deposit 200 kyats in Burmese currency as a deposit with the Home Department when applying for a visa. This cash deposit is refundable upon departure from Burma, but the application procedure is more troublesome." (2) The Guangzhou Bay route to the mainland is still open.

Hong Kong Entry Permits: Application Procedures

(3) Two Important Points for Hong Kong Entry Permits: A Hong Kong letter mentions two points to note regarding the procedures for applying for Hong Kong entry permits. They are copied below: (A) If the applicant has an address in Hong Kong, please fill it in detail. If the address in Hong Kong is forwarded by the China Travel Service on behalf of a transit traveler, a six-month entry permit cannot be obtained. Only a special term permit of one or three months will be issued. (B) Under the item "What is the purpose of your trip to Hong Kong," if it is stated that one is employed by a company or organization, it is quite difficult to obtain a permit, as the employer must personally go to the bureau to sign a guarantee before it can be obtained, which often delays the date. In the future, it is advisable to fill in the application form as "transit." Otherwise, the employee must first send a letter to the employer to contact the China Travel Service in Hong Kong.

### Two Labor Disputes Resolved Satisfactorily

Noodle Industry

The labor-management dispute in the machine-made noodle industry has been resolved satisfactorily after fair mediation by various parties, and the following articles have been signed: (1) Wages below ten yuan will be increased by 80%, wages below fifteen yuan will be increased by 70%, and wages of fifteen yuan or more will be increased by 60%. (2) Workers who have worked for one full year will be paid double wages at the end of the year. If a worker has requested leave or been laid off, the worker is responsible for finding a replacement; otherwise, it will be considered absenteeism. (3) If a worker is sick, the employer will handle it as before and provide an appropriate subsidy. (4) Workers will be dismissed on a three-month probationary period. If the employer discovers any negligence in work during this period, the labor union will be notified five days in advance, and the wages will be calculated based on the number of days worked. (5) When the employer hires new workers, they will be introduced by the labor union after the labor union is established. If the labor union has no workers to introduce, the employer is free to hire. (6) Workers' meals will be treated the same as the employer's. (7) After the employer dismisses a worker, the wages of newly hired workers should be based on the wages of the dismissed worker as a standard, but if the work ability is not as good as the dismissed worker, the matter will be discussed with the labor union. (8) These articles will take effect on July 25.

Hengda Factory

The American-owned Hengda Machinery Factory at the intersection of Daxi Road and Dunxin Road was shut down on the 11th. After repeated negotiations, the workers have resolved the issue of dismissals with the employer, and all workers' severance pay will be in accordance with the American factory law (those who have worked for one month will be given five days' severance pay, those who have worked for one year will be given two months' severance pay, and so on). It has been agreed and approved that a mediation record will be signed today, and dismissal payments will be distributed to the workers.

### Xin Puyu Hall Eagerly Awaits Continued Donations

Still Short Over 50,000 Yuan This Year

Xin Puyu Hall in the Nanshi district, a well-known Catholic charitable organization, has been established for nearly thirty years. It is grand in scale and perfectly equipped, with a nursery, orphanage, nursing home, and disability home, accommodating thousands of orphans, the elderly, and the disabled. Under the leadership and education of the sisters of the Charity Society, they are no different from a paradise reborn for the poor, sick, orphaned, and suffering.

Before the war, the hall relied on the economic assistance of the Belgian Catholic Church and fixed donations raised from all parties by the hall directors, and its progress was extremely smooth. The relief work expanded year by year. After the war, external donations sharply decreased, and the Belgian Church, due to the fall of their homeland, was unable to take care of itself and stopped providing assistance. Due to these two major changes, coupled with soaring prices and a sharp increase in the need for supplies, it

Has fallen into difficult circumstances.

After on-site observation by this newspaper, it was felt that if such a complete orphanage and educational institution were allowed to close and be disbanded, it would be tantamount to sitting idly by and watching society suffer a great loss. Therefore, this newspaper has appealed to its readers on its behalf. Fortunately, it has been enthusiastically responded to by readers, and a total of more than 140,000 yuan in donations has been received from January to July. According to the

Budget prepared by the hall,

An annual expenditure of 192,000 yuan is required, and it is still short of over 50,000 yuan. It is eagerly hoped that all sectors of society will continue to make donations so that the education of hundreds of orphans will not be interrupted, and the elderly and disabled can enjoy their remaining years in peace. The titles of the donors before June have been published and thanked in the newspaper on May 12 and July 8, respectively.

Donations for July and this month will be publicly thanked in early September. Collection locations: (1) Trust Department of the Silk Industry Bank, 460 Hankou Road; (2) Banque Belge pour l'Etranger (Overseas), Sassoon House, the Bund; (3) Jihua Hall Pharmacy, 47 Yunnan Road; (4) Huamei Pharmacy, 56 Fuzhou Road; (5) Catholic Church, Catholic Church Street. Collection location for donated goods: Catholic Church, Catholic Church Street.

### Appeal to All Sectors to Save Disaster Relief Funds

The Frugality Movement Committee yesterday specially appealed to all sectors of society not to use useful surplus money for unnecessary extravagance during this national crisis. The general idea is that as the weather gradually becomes cooler, the number of disaster victims accommodated in the city increases. As commodity prices rise, supplies increase accordingly, and donations are limited, which will affect the supply of disaster victims. Beggars roaming the streets are also not a few, lacking both clothing and food, and their situation is particularly pitiful. Therefore, it is hoped that fellow citizens in the city will, with the righteousness of having already experienced hunger and drowning, save unnecessary expenses on ceremonies and donate to charity organizations to benefit disaster relief and stabilize social order.

### Youthful Students Arrive at the Newspaper to Receive Aid: A Grand Occasion; Industry and Commerce Employees Begin Applying Yesterday

Approved students from universities and middle schools received their educational aid at this newspaper yesterday morning. Employees in industry and commerce also started receiving application forms for aid for evening classes yesterday. Students and employees in industry and commerce, with joyful emotions, happily fulfilled their desire to learn, all thanks to the generous donations of the readers of this newspaper. The details are recorded as follows:

Surplus Aid: Voluntary Deduction

Around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, students from universities and middle schools who applied for aid came to the newspaper one after another to receive their educational aid according to the procedures. They were checked and distributed one by one. Among them, several students had originally applied to several schools. The amount of educational aid they originally applied for was higher than the tuition fees of the school they are currently enrolled in. They all stated at the time that they requested a reduction in the amount to be distributed to match the tuition fees of the school they are currently enrolled in. This kind of pure and sincere behavior is the inherent spirit of cultivating outstanding members of society. If the students can work even harder, their future achievements will be remarkable.

Approved Amount: Standard Set

Some applicants came in person or inquired in writing about the discrepancy between the approved educational aid and the amount of school tuition. The review standard is based on (1) economic situation and (2) academic performance. If the family is still able to manage and is not completely destitute, a portion of the aid will be provided, and this portion may not even cover the tuition fees. If the family is poor and there are two or more siblings applying at the same time, in addition to subsidizing tuition and miscellaneous fees for senior students in accordance with the regulations, junior students will be given a portion of the aid. There are also several extremely poor and hardworking university students whose tuition and miscellaneous fees collected by the school are only thirty or forty yuan. This newspaper may specially provide aid beyond the regulations to be used for purchasing books, as the cost of books for each semester of university and college is very high. This method is also deeply appreciated by those who generously donate to benefit poor students. Several applicants will certainly be able to consider their own situation, or even be better off than others. There are many poor students, and it is deeply regrettable that we have not been able to benefit everyone. It is hoped that the students will apply early next semester to avoid missing the opportunity.

Late Applications: Difficult to Accommodate

Since this newspaper announced the approval of educational aid for all levels of elementary, middle, and high schools and began payments yesterday, the staff has already completed the work for this period and is now beginning to prepare for the educational aid specifically for employees in industry and commerce. However, we have continued to receive letters from poor students asking for special accommodation for applying for aid, and there are still quite a few. Yesterday, we also received a letter from Mr. Wang Jialin, stating, "Recently, because a small number of poor and studious students went to other places during the summer vacation to visit relatives or suffered serious illnesses, they were unable to complete the application procedures within the time limit stipulated by your newspaper, and therefore could not receive the educational aid from your newspaper and lost the opportunity to study. Such situations may still exist. However, this is a good opportunity that they themselves have given up, and there is no reason to forgive them. However, your newspaper's purpose is to help poor and outstanding children. I wonder if your newspaper can allow a special opportunity for applicants to provide a detailed reason. If it is considered forgivable, please approve it exceptionally. I wonder what your newspaper's opinion is?" Such a situation may be unavoidable. On the one hand, the staff deeply sympathizes with the plight of poor and studious youth, but on the other hand, they must abide by the decision and cannot change it on their own. Facts and reason are difficult to reconcile. Poor students urgently request aid, but we should not allow the staff to violate the law in any way. Therefore, we can only disappoint the hopes of poor students who applied late and hope that they will pay special attention when this newspaper holds the event on a scheduled date.

Shop Assistants and Apprentices: Enthusiastic Applications

Application forms for employees in industry and commerce were also issued for the first time yesterday, and more than 400 people came to the newspaper to receive them, which proves the large number of shop assistants and apprentices who have dropped out of school and their eagerness to study. Shop assistants and apprentices from various factories and stores sent letters yesterday expressing their deep admiration for the readers of this newspaper for their concern for shop assistants who have dropped out of school. For example, Mr. Wang wrote in his letter, "Your newspaper's announcement of providing aid to employees in industry and commerce to enroll in cram schools made me cry with joy. I am a trainee who has just completed my apprenticeship, and my income is very meager. The old clothes that I have worn for three or four years are still my friends, and my family often asks me for money. I really want to learn English, but I am unable to. Now your newspaper has educational aid for employees, which makes me see the light." Other letters also have the same feelings. What we want to comfort Mr. Wang is that although the clothes are old, it does not hinder his future. With sufficient knowledge, he can achieve something. Wearing old clothes and learning new skills, his future success is undoubtedly certain.

### Teng Gu Died in the Capital; Shanghai Friends Collect Funeral Expenses

Mr. Teng Ruoqu, Gu, served as a counselor in the Executive Yuan for many years. He was knowledgeable and diligent in his work, and he was willing to enthusiastically promote cultural and artistic undertakings. His colleagues in the country all admired him. Unfortunately, he passed away in Chongqing in May of this year. When his relatives and friends in Shanghai suddenly heard the bad news, they were all shocked and grieved. Mr. Teng worked hard for the country during his lifetime and did not engage in family production. Therefore, his affairs after his death were extremely desolate. His elderly mother, widowed wife, and young children all need to be supported. Recently, many relatives and friends in Shanghai initiated the collection of funeral expenses, published advertisements in various newspapers, and widely solicited contributions. It is now heard that the donations for this funeral are quite enthusiastic, but the period for collecting funeral expenses is coming to an end. If there are any relatives and friends of Mr. Teng who have not yet donated funeral expenses, they can quickly send the funeral expenses to Mr. Cao at 528 Kang Nai Road within the next few days, as it may be too late. It is human nature to sympathize with the dead. To cherish and remember old friends is even more regrettable. I sincerely hope that Mr. Teng's relatives and friends in Shanghai will pay attention.

### Ningbo Siming Bank Moves to Shanghai to Handle Receipts and Payments

The Ningbo Siming Bank has withdrawn since the fall of Ningbo, and it has been four months since then. It is now learned that the manager of the Ningbo branch of the bank recently came to Shanghai from Zhejiang to request instructions from the head office and negotiate the results. Because the bank is purely commercial in nature and aims to facilitate the public, it has decided to move to Shanghai to handle receipts and payments. Depositors in Ningbo in the past can also withdraw their money in Shanghai.

### Western Police Officers Transferred; 34 New Officers Appointed

The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department recently had a batch of Western police officers transferred, and those who have been approved for duty include Deputy Inspector Dou Tous, Sergeants Truheibo, Douweier, Limau, Nikuer, Zhong Diwens, Geluke, and Probationary Sergeants Panlai, Guokepeng, and others, totaling ten people. Thirty-four new people, including Antefu, have been appointed as probationary sergeants.

### Two Shanghai Theaters, Hukuang and Jincheng, Were Struck by Smoke Bombs Yesterday; Explosions Occurred One After Another, Fortunately No One Was Injured; The Intention Seems to Be Intimidation

Yesterday morning, two major theaters in Shanghai, Hukuang and Jincheng, were struck by bomb explosions one after another. Fortunately, no one was injured in either location. The details learned are recorded below.

Hukuang

Yesterday was Sunday, so Hukuang Theater on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession added an early morning performance at 10:30 AM. At 11:30 AM, the theater suddenly received a strange phone call, informing the theater that there was a package in the men's restroom downstairs and to send someone to open it quickly, or it would explode. The theater immediately reported the situation to the French Concession police and sent workers to inspect the restroom. They found a package placed in one location. When the package on top was opened, it contained a bullet and a letter. At that time, the police had arrived and knew that there must be dangerous items in the other package, so they ordered it not to be touched. As expected, before the words were finished, an explosion occurred, with a loud bang and thick smoke billowing out. It was extinguished immediately. Because the explosive force was weak, no one was injured. However, at that time, it was the end of the show, and the audience was greatly alarmed. It is learned that the letter attached in the package roughly stated that the theater must send someone to Gaoqiao today (the 25th) to negotiate, and the person must carry a ham as a sign. The French Concession police have ordered a strict investigation of the case and the arrest of the perpetrators.

Jincheng

After the bomb incident in the French Concession, unexpectedly, around 12:00 noon, a bomb explosion also occurred in the Jincheng Theater on Beijing Road. The bomb was also a smoke bomb and was placed under a seat in the theater. Fortunately, the audience had already left the theater for a long time, so no one was injured. It is learned that the bomb was similar in size to the one at Hukuang. According to general speculation, the motive for placing the bomb must be the same as that of Hukuang.

### Mother-in-Law Intentionally Extorted, Son-in-Law Harmed, Sentenced to Punishment

Yongren Wang Linbao (19 years old), an apprentice at Sanyang South Goods Store on Nanjing Road, was in love with Wu Ayuan, a Nanjing woman who was a glass cup tea waitress in the movie department of the Wing On Company's rooftop garden. They lived together in a rented house at 185 McTaggart Road. Wang Linbao was successively deceived by the woman's mother, Wu Zhang, out of 3,600 yuan in betrothal gifts, and she also wanted 1,400 yuan for marriage expenses, causing Wang Linbao to resent her. Suspecting that she was intentionally extorting and wanting to marry his daughter to someone else, he took the opportunity to pour mercury into the oily bean curd vermicelli and gave it to her to swallow, intending to harm her life. After the case occurred, he was arrested and sent for trial. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The defendant hired lawyer Wang Yaotang to defend him. He was instructed to await sentencing. The presiding judge Jiang Xia visited the court the other day and sentenced Wang Linbao to five months in prison for harming someone's body. If he can commute the sentence to a fine, one yuan will be equivalent to one day.

### Rong Wu Society Lectures: Responsibilities for Harmonizing Five Religions; Research on National Music After the Loss of the Classic of Music

The 21st lecture of the Rong Wu Society was given by Mr. Shen Jueling on "Our Confucian Scholars Should Embody Confucius's Intention to Teach All People and Jointly Shoulder the Responsibility of Harmonizing the Five Religions," Section 2 of the "Liji Jingjie Pian," Six Classics, Han Shu, Yiwenzhi, Six Arts, and Analects, Classic of Filial Piety. Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke on "Research on National Music After the Loss of the Classic of Music." Mr. Shen began by saying,

Harmonizing the Five Classics

The Liji Jingjie Pian says, "Confucius said, by entering a country, you can know its teachings. If its people are gentle and sincere, it is the teaching of poetry. If they are insightful and know how to avoid harm, it is the teaching of history. If they are broad-minded and easy to get along with, it is the teaching of music. If they are clean, quiet, and subtle, it is the teaching of the Book of Changes. If they are respectful, frugal, solemn, and reverent, it is the teaching of rites. If they are skilled in rhetoric and compare events, it is the teaching of the Spring and Autumn Annals. Therefore, the loss of poetry is ignorance, the loss of history is deceit, the loss of music is extravagance, the loss of the Book of Changes is treachery, the loss of rites is annoyance, and the loss of the Spring and Autumn Annals is chaos. If its people are gentle and sincere but not ignorant, then they are deeply versed in poetry. If they are insightful and know how to avoid harm but not deceitful, then they are deeply versed in history. If they are broad-minded and easy to get along with but not extravagant, then they are deeply versed in music. If they are clean, quiet, and subtle but not treacherous, then they are deeply versed in the Book of Changes. If they are respectful, frugal, solemn, and reverent but not annoying, then they are deeply versed in rites. If they are skilled in rhetoric and compare events but not chaotic, then they are deeply versed in the Spring and Autumn Annals." The Six Classics were all edited by Confucius himself, so his teachings could be known by entering a country. Those who receive the teachings of the Six Classics sometimes inevitably have the disadvantage of losing balance, but Confucius still harmonized them with balance, which is why he is a sage. The Han Shu Yiwenzhi regarded the Six Classics as the Six Arts and prefaced the Six Arts by saying, "The texts of the Six Arts, music to harmonize the spirit, the expression of benevolence. Poetry to correct speech, the use of righteousness. Rites to make clear the good, the clear are obvious, so there is no training. History to broaden hearing, the art of knowledge. Spring and Autumn to judge events, the symbol of trust. The five are the way of the Five Constants, they need each other to be complete, and the Book of Changes is the origin." The Book of Changes uses Yin and Yang lines to be in the correct position to be upright, and when they are in the correct position, Yin lines are in the second place and Yang lines are in the fifth place to be balanced.

The Way of Balance and Harmony

The Doctrine of the Mean says, "Balance is the great foundation of the world, and harmony is the path to all people." The great Confucian scholar Zheng Kangcheng of the Han Dynasty said, "The Doctrine of the Mean is to clarify the use of balance and harmony. The meaning of harmony is great!" The Yiwenzhi preface to the Analects says, "The Analects is the dialogue of Confucius with his disciples and contemporaries, and the words heard by the disciples from each other and received from the Master. The disciples recorded them at all times. After the Master died, the disciples edited and abridged them together, so it is called the Analects." The preface to the Classic of Filial Piety says, "The Classic of Filial Piety is Confucius's statement of the way of filial piety to Zengzi. Filial piety is the warp of heaven, the righteousness of earth, and the conduct of the people. It speaks of the greatest things, so it is called the Classic of Filial Piety." The thirteen classics that are called today, the Han Zhi included the Analects in the Xiaoxue Jia (Elementary Learning) and the Erya in the Classic of Filial Piety Jia (School of the Classic of Filial Piety). It is clear that these three classics should all be recited and learned in childhood, and the Arts are the learning of higher education. Mr. Shen was old and recovering from illness, so he could not speak much, so Mr. Yang took over and said:

Chinese Musical Arts

Chinese musical arts developed the earliest. Yi Qi had earth drums and reed flutes, Ge Tian had the Xuan Bird dance music, Zhu Xiang had the five-stringed se, Mi Xi had the nine-stringed qin, the fifty-stringed se had Nuwa's sheng and reed pipes, and Shennong had the five-stringed qin bells and chimes. The details are described in the Liji Lvlan Shiben. When Huang ordered Linglun to create the twelve temperament pipes, he changed the silk strings to mulberry, and the eight tones were complete. The music has temperament, so it can "establish balance," "produce standards," and "prepare numbers." As for the few, there are five temperaments in Greece, the same as Babylon and Hebrew. Later, there were seven temperaments, the same as Egypt, and twelve temperaments, the same as China. There were fourteen temperaments in Siam, seventeen temperaments in Anxi Dash, twenty-two temperaments in Juan Du, nineteen temperaments by Italians in the Ming Dynasty, fifty-two temperaments by Belgians in the early Qing Dynasty, and forty-one temperaments by Hungarians in the late Qing Dynasty. The most were Jingfang's sixty temperaments and Qian's three hundred and sixty temperaments. Zheng Zhu of the Ming Dynasty created the twelve equal temperaments. More than a hundred years later, the Germans began to know how to advocate its use, and it has been popular to this day. Recently, there has been a proposal to adopt the twenty-four temperaments of Western Asia, which is the "Little One Temperament" of the History of Music in the Book of Wei (to be continued).

### Juxing Jewelry Store Robbed of Jewelry Yesterday Morning; Gold Bars and Jewelry Worth More Than 200,000 Yuan; Police Reported and Rewards Offered to Recover the Stolen Goods

Yesterday morning, the Juxing Jewelry Store in the French Concession was suddenly robbed by eight bandits.

The Juxing Zhengji Jewelry Store is located at 264 and 266 Gongyi Road, the intersection of Zhengjia Wood Bridge Street. It faces south and has a back door inside Jilian Lane. It was established by Sun Yonglin from Wuxi. Sun and his wife, Ms. Ding, live above the jewelry store. At 6:30 AM yesterday morning, eight bandits suddenly broke in. Four bandits were wearing coffee-colored long gowns, one was wearing a white silk long gown, and the other three bandits were wearing black short clothes and pants. They spoke in a local accent. Four bandits, armed with box guns, broke in through the back door and went straight to the safe in the shop to hide the jewelry. They opened the safe and robbed 23 gold bracelets, 5 gold bars (10 taels each), 154 gold rings, and 32 gold circles, totaling 456 taels and worth about 420,000 yuan. Before leaving, they also robbed more than 2,000 yuan in cash and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the jewelry store truthfully prepared a loss list and submitted it to the police to arrest the perpetrators. At the same time, a reward of 20% was offered to recover the stolen goods.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### The Experiment of Clothing

— Narrated by Zhuge Liang

According to those who have deep experience in society: "A person must have at least two different masks to stand in society—the special society now."

But how can one have two different masks? Although there are many different masks in toy stores, how can you wear them to see people? After thinking for two days, I had a flash of inspiration, and I prepared two sets of clothes: a Parisian suit and a blue cloth long gown.

On the one hand, I had nothing to do after graduation and was idle at home all day, which was simply suffocating. On the other hand, I wanted to test society before entering it, so as not to suffer losses in the future.

At first, I took turns wearing the two pieces of clothing, looking in the mirror in the closet. The first decision revealed nothing; the second decision was still not enough; so I watched it three times. Ah! I feel that I am a person in a suit, but when I put myself in Chinese clothing, am I not a person? In other words, I am me in a suit; but in Chinese clothing, I am still myself. What's the difference?

Oh, some people say that I look like a young man in a suit. Ha! Would I become a white-bearded old man if I wore a blue cloth gown? Ah, God is my witness!

There is also one thing that I shouldn't mention, lest I hurt a friend's friendship. But that person is very open-minded, and probably "a gentleman does not remember the faults of villains."

One day, that friend said: "The way you walk is very graceful, lively and innocent, somewhat like Hollywood's Tyrone Power." In his bright eyes, I saw that this was not sarcasm.

Although I am not very familiar with Tyrone Power, I have met him on the screen once or twice; as for resembling him, I have never even dreamed of it. I remember the "Strategies of the Warring States" saying that Zou Ji did not think that Xu Gong of the north of the city was beautiful, but Ji still had a beautiful appearance. After I looked in the mirror myself, ah, You Choufu was ridiculous, I accepted that comment, which made me sweat with shame, and I wished I could find a hole to hide in.

However, one day, that friend said again: "You often deliberately put on airs when walking, which is really artificial."

How strange! He praised me at first, but then criticized me. I don't know what the mystery is. After studying for four days, I always felt that my walking was the same at all times. Perhaps my detective skills were still a little clever, and I finally found the truth on the fifth day. It turned out that I was wearing a suit when we met the first time, and a blue cloth gown the second time.

But another question was swirling in my mind: Why does a suit make my movements graceful, but a long gown make people feel disgusted?

I lost sleep for two nights for that question. No, it can be said that it was three nights, because at 11:57 on the third night, I got the answer. The answer made me jump out of bed and I was excited all night.

The reason is very simple. You think, has Tyrone Power ever worn a blue cloth gown? Yes, that's the answer.

Wearing a blue cloth gown and looking around in a certain company aroused the attention of an inspector, who bothered him to "protect" me tightly. When I stood in front of a certain department, he stood nearby, staring at me with torch-like eyes. The more I didn't buy anything, the more suspicious he became. Thank you for his kindness, he took me all the way to the door.

Not reconciled, I changed into Western clothes a week later. Although I didn't encounter that inspector, the female staff's stern face was much kinder. Perhaps it was my attitude of looking around that attracted her attention. She asked me a question. At first, I thought her question might have the same effect as the inspector's gaze; ah! I was wrong.

"Do you need to buy something?" she asked.

I silently returned home, picked up a magnifying glass, and searched the blue cloth gown. There was no "thief" character on it. Perhaps my magnifying glass is not as good as the inspector's eyeballs? Yes, there are many people in the world whose pupils can far surpass a microscope, because they can clearly observe wealth and poverty in clothes. If you use a microscope, hum, don't even think about it!

### A Painting in the Study

— Master Zilan

In the past, Duke Jin lived in Jinling and brought Yuan An's snow painting to hang in his pavilion, and he felt that the summer heat was cool and the fatigue of official documents was relieved. Therefore, all comfort for people really belongs to the soul. Recently, Mr. Wells predicted world events as clearly as watching fire, but his conclusion is that when everything will not exist in the future, painters will definitely not be reduced. It can be seen what a great job it is!

Let's say that people like us who work at desks all day long, when we are tired, we look up and see a good painting on the wall. It has great lines and beautiful displays; let's say it is a Chinese painting, it contains a full ancient atmosphere, which makes people immediately energetic. I have always had a good hobby for traditional Chinese paintings, and I especially like the two old friends Wu Hufan and Chen Dieye. Hufan's spring exhibition of teachers and students allowed me to appreciate the great art; now Dieye also has a personal painting show at the Daxin Art Hall, which will last from today until the end of August. He has a full year of painting time, but only more than one hundred and twenty pieces are produced; he himself thinks it is already too much, and in the future, he will always advocate a personal exhibition with only a dozen or twenty pieces, and the preparation time is preferably two years. On this point, we can believe that his paintings can be carefully crafted and full of his own soul, giving us comfort.

### A Week's Home-Style Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

The era of watermelons and cantaloupes has passed, and cucumbers have long been old. Among the melon family, only loofah and winter melon are still active in the vegetable market. Loofah doesn't feel old at all, and the price is still a bit expensive, two or three can be bought for a dime, and buying things for two or four cents, adding some auxiliary products, can also deal with two meals a day. Last time I said that loofah can only be used for vegetarian dishes, and there is no place for it in meat dishes. However, the editor forwarded a letter from reader Mr. Du Lubing, saying that loofah can be fried with eggs and made into egg soup. The method is very simple, just peel the loofah, cut it into small pieces, mix it with eggs, and then stir-fry it in a pot. When making soup, in addition to loofah and egg flowers, you can add dried shrimp or scallops, which also taste very delicious.

### How to Use a Thermos?

— Changcheng Ganmin

As the name suggests, a thermos is used to store hot water. Everyone knows how to use it: pour hot water into the bottle and put the cork on. There are no other mysteries. But for how to prolong its life? How to maintain its effectiveness? And how to use it in a hygienic way? Many people neglect these points; often, due to improper use, not only does it cost more money, but it also brings unnecessary troubles, which is really frustrating. Now I will write down the most common and easily made mistakes in using a thermos, hoping that mothers will pay attention to them. It can also be regarded as a kind of common sense in the family.

1. Before pouring boiling water, you must first warm it with warm water to avoid the bottle liner from suddenly exploding due to heat.

2. After flushing the water, you must wipe dry the water stains on all parts of the bottle shell, otherwise the dripping at the bottom will gradually rot, and after a long time, there will be a risk of the bottom falling off, and it will endanger the bottle liner.

3. Before adding water, you must pour out the water stored in the bottle and wash it, so as to avoid impurities in the water (commonly known as water feet) from attaching to the bottle. After a long time, the glass will definitely become sandy. After that, the poured water must also be contaminated, and if you accidentally drink it, it will hinder your health.

4. If the cork rots after a long time of use and is not replaced, drinking the broken wood chips with the water will also hinder hygiene. (Thanks for your payment)

### Economic Drinks

— Jingxuan

As the saying goes: "Hunger thinks of food, thirst thinks of drink." Food and drink are both necessities of life. The gap between rich and poor is huge at sea, and what people drink varies. In dance halls and restaurants, a glass of orange juice and a cup of ice cream cost two or three yuan, which is the drink of the rich. On street corners, a glass of fruit dew costs two cents, and a glass of sour plum soup costs one cent, which is the drink of the poor. The former is very expensive, and the latter is unhygienic. Therefore, I have recorded several kinds of ordinary drinks, which are both economical and hygienic. No matter where you are, they are very easy to obtain. Readers can try them.

(1) Honeysuckle Soup: Use a pinch of honeysuckle and chrysanthemum, add one or two fresh and old fragrant leaves, and one or two pieces of licorice (not too much, too much will be too sweet). Brew with boiling water and drink it cold. It is sweet and refreshing, and it can relieve heat and fire. Drinking it for a long time can prevent sores and boils.

(2) Barley Tea: Roast barley until it is dry, one property, brew it with boiling water, it has the aroma of coffee, and none of the bitterness of tea. Drinking it often in summer has more advantages than disadvantages.

(3) Homemade Coffee Tea: Take one liter of shelled and peeled peanuts, stir-fry them dry in a wok until nine-tenths of each grain is scorched, take them out, mash them with a mortar, and when drinking, take a spoonful of white sugar and a spoonful of homemade coffee, and brew them with boiling water. The taste is no less than that of Brazilian goods.

(4) Homemade Cocoa Tea: Take one liter of shelled barley, stir-fry it dry in a wok, put it into a grinder and grind it into a fine powder after it is scorched, and when drinking, add a spoonful of white sugar and brew it with boiling water. The taste is not much different from cocoa.

Brief News Since the publication of the Pocket Book of Hawthorne Detective Cases by Cheng Xiaqing, published by the World Book Company, it has been widely sold. Now, three more types have been released: (8) The White-Clothed Monster, (9) The Death Charm, and (10) The Contradiction Circle. The seventh type, "The Homecoming of the Dance Queen," was previously published in this newspaper and has now been made into a movie, renamed "Sound Inspection on a Rainy Night," which will be released soon.

### How Do Shop Assistants and Apprentices Improve Themselves?

— Editor

Generally speaking, shop assistants and apprentices are not lacking in well-educated people, but some also have the pain of not having enough knowledge to apply. They may doubt a certain *cheng* in the production machinery, the social relations of commodities, or even the reason why accounting subjects are so... Their basic business is not incompetent because of proficiency; however, perhaps when they come into contact with the depth of work, efficiency is ultimately not very pleasant and well-considered due to certain limitations. Some shop assistants and apprentices received only very limited school education at the beginning of their employment, although their service experience has exceeded a special class of half-bottle soy sauce and a can of vinegar freshly graduated students.

Since the business of modern society is so complicated, everything is becoming rationalized and scientific, and entrepreneurs are striving to strengthen their careers and seek a way out, then how can most employees not adapt to the trend and be good at coping with new changes in various jobs? The way of learning is to seek progress. Tang Zhi's plate inscription says: "If you are new every day, and new again every day, and new every day, it is not easy to be an outdated luxury in an era.

Every time I see a kind of person, holding the view of being a monk for a day and hitting the clock for a day, whether it is the abbot, the host, the receptionist, or the incense burner, they strive for perfunctory and perfunctory, and the work is done haphazardly, let alone how to chant sutras, and whether the clock strikes new or old. Since the service is too rigid and monotonous, then their life naturally has a feeling of "living like a year". This kind of psychology accumulates over time and develops the habit of "complaining about everything", but don't you hear people say? A line of work produces top scholars. My job is to make the products excellent, increase sales, improve customer service, and make the accounting system strict. These must be carefully studied, and progress must be sought every day in order to stand out and win the final victory.

Modern enlightened entrepreneurs are not short-sighted, (many institutions pay for trainees to study in depth to adapt to the business, which is one example) they work hard and have made great achievements. In their spare time, they do not forget to improve their studies; they hope to create a bright road for the country and private enterprises!

A group organization that cultivates a "love of learning" has a great help to the overall business, and it is not impossible to develop better habits in personal private life. Every time I see a few employees who are bored after work, some sing and play the piano, and even more are constantly dancing in the pavilions, eating tofu, and their lives lose their normal order, and their budgets lose their balance. The reason for this lies in leisure, and the way to save it is to improve. The ancients said that we should cultivate our noble spirit, and the so-called spirit is indeed derived from cultivation. From this, we can be unshakable, undaunted, kind, and sharp. The objective environment really depends on the subjective transformation. I dare not make idealistic sermons here.

Let's look at the successful entrepreneurs and employees at home and abroad. Which one did not come from hard study? A chemistry encyclopedia, a new accounting, part-time tutoring, reading until midnight, holding your breath to knock on the door, climbing on the counter, sleeping under the quilt, and getting up the next morning to manage things, you feel refreshed. "Using the Yingshuo's axe to attack the good material of Qizi," a group of bosses and owners with brains treat shop assistants and apprentices just like the arms and wrists, and receive their effects. Therefore, they trust each other up and down and run in parallel without conflict.

Naturally, in this extraordinary period, the cost of living is so high, and most employees want to improve their studies, but they are limited by the environment. Fortunately, social figures with this enthusiasm have repeatedly urged, and all walks of life have responded sincerely. The Shen Bao's promotion of the shop assistant reading movement does not worry about not having any results. It can be shown as fulfilling its small role for the society.

### It's Difficult to Hire an Ayi

— Yu'er

The Li family's ayi went back to the countryside, so Mrs. Li had to twist her small feet to personally call an ayi at the intermediary shop - a tall Shandong woman. She was as strong as an ox and did all kinds of heavy work; Mrs. Li was of course very satisfied, but there was one thing that made her very regretful, that is, she had to eat three big bowls of rice every meal, so Mrs. Li made up her mind to rather spend a few more yuan on wages and ask her to eat less rice. She discussed it with her:

"Hey, ayi, you do a very good job, but you eat too much rice, so I will give you three yuan for rice in addition to the five yuan in wages, that is to say, you have to eat two big bowls of rice less every meal."

"I won't do that. I came out to be an ayi to eat my fill." Saying that, she picked up her package and left. Mrs. Li stared blankly at her back disappearing outside the door.

From then on, Mrs. Li learned a lesson, that is, a big-bodied ayi eats too much; so the next day she went to the intermediary shop to call a small-bodied ayi. She felt very satisfied, at least she ate less rice. Unexpectedly, this ayi came with a "voluntary resignation", saying that there were too many people and the work was too busy to handle.

There are many people in the Li family, and the weather is hot. Mrs. Li can't do so much housework, so she feels very annoyed. After dinner, Mrs. Li moved a stool to the lane to enjoy the breeze, and talked to the neighbors about hiring an ayi. The ayi next door was very "enthusiastic" and was willing to introduce someone to her, and guaranteed that she would be satisfied.

The next morning, the ayi next door really brought a young and strong person. Mrs. Li left her behind. She paid attention to her work, and really, she found her 100% satisfied; not only did she work quickly, but she also ate very little. Mrs. Li couldn't help but laugh in her heart when she was satisfied. The third day was the day to "weigh the wages". This is the old rule. Mrs. Li was prepared to talk to her about the "wage issue", but to her surprise, the ayi opened her mouth first and said:

"There are always mahjong games, and guests are always invited... The wages should be twelve yuan, and the extra money should be at least five yuan. If not, then I won't do it."

"The extra money is based on "the forehead", the wages are only..." Before she could finish speaking, the ayi patted her butt and left.

Mrs. Li was stunned for a long time.

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

12. Unexpected Troubles

The so-called "she," of course, is Mei Bao.

So, did Mei Bao ultimately escape Shang Lao Er's clutches? This requires the facts that occurred half a month later to prove it.

This day was the day before the Lantern Festival in the lunar calendar. Hengshui County Middle School had only been open for three or four days, and classes had not officially started yet. Mei Bao was already being escorted into the city by Zhang Xiaogouzi.

On the morning of the day she left Zhangshu Village, Autumn Begonia specially locked the door and saw his daughter off to the market entrance west of the village.

"With your natural talent, you can definitely make a living as an opera singer." As they were about to part, he handed the small leather suitcase he was carrying to Mei Bao and said to her in a very solemn tone, "But you must know that I have already fallen into a big pit in this field. Unless it is absolutely necessary, I really don't want you to step into this very dangerous circle..."

Mei Bao lowered her head, fiddling with a short braid on her left side, listening quietly.

"Now I don't expect anything else, I just hope you study hard. Once this half year is over and you have a junior high school diploma, you can find a job in any elementary school. Even if it's a bit tough, we'll be much more at peace!" Autumn Begonia placed both hands on Mei Bao's shoulders and continued, word by word, "Child, listen to me, you must study hard in school, and don't take to heart the few operas I taught you. What Uncle Zhao said has always been a bit crazy, so don't take it seriously. Anyway, you'll have more free time when you become a teacher in the future, and I can slowly teach you then, it'll be in time..." (193)

### Worldly Ways

— Baisha

Dancer A: Spending ten dollars today was worth it after all. That girl looks only eighteen years old, but somehow, her dance steps are very experienced.

Dancer B: What's so strange about that? The one I met the other day was much prettier, but small dance halls, walking in and out, are detrimental to one's dignity.
Dancer A: It's getting late, let's go to a restaurant for a bite to eat!

Dancer B: Brother! Save it! Not much money left. I still have to go for a decisive battle tomorrow night.

If I quarrel with someone, and it reaches the point where it's unbearable, it's best to strike first. I'll give him a punch to the chest, called "Black Tiger Stealing Heart."

### Able to Bend and Stretch

— Mingchi

If he's about to repay me with interest on top of the principal, and I see that the situation is not good, I might as well grease my feet and run away as fast as possible, which is called "Lion Shaking its Head."

If he refuses to give up and catches up to grab me? Then I might as well offer him three kowtows, which is called "Child Worshipping Guanyin."
