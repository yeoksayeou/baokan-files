### The Chinese Army in Southern Henan Recaptures Queshan - Fleeing Japanese Troops Retreat Towards Xinyang - Over 4,000 Japanese Soldiers Killed in Action in Nanyang

Chongqing - Today's news: Regarding the situation in Henan Province, the Japanese troops who launched an attack on January 24th have now been driven back to approximately their original positions. The Chinese army has successfully recaptured Queshan and several areas east and west of the railway. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Chongqing - According to well-informed Chinese sources here, although the final outcome of the war in southern Henan remains to be seen, the Japanese offensive in Henan Province appears to be coming to an end without achieving any significant results. This Japanese offensive, which began on January 24th from Xinyang, was purportedly carried out by four divisions, but in reality, it only involved about two and a half divisions. Although the Japanese captured Nanyang on February 5th, the Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack and recaptured the city on [day of the week]. As a result, the Japanese launched a general retreat and are now withdrawing towards Tongbai, in other words, back to their base near Xinyang. It is reported that the Japanese suffered heavy losses in this retreat. According to Chinese military authorities, the Chinese army had intelligence of the Japanese plans to attack at least a week before the Japanese advance, as it was learned that the Japanese mechanized units were heavily concentrated near Xinyang. Therefore, elite troops were quickly dispatched to southern Henan, arriving in time to resist the Japanese. These elite troops are known for their fighting prowess, and they dealt a severe blow to the Japanese, inflicting significant casualties. The Japanese could not withstand the attack and retreated southwest to their base. Well-informed Chinese sources here predict a major battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies this spring. The Japanese may attempt to take Enshi via Yichang along the south bank of the Yangtze River to infiltrate Chongqing, making a desperate gamble. It is estimated that the Japanese will mobilize fifteen divisions for this operation, but transportation will be a major difficulty. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Chongqing - Today, newspapers continue to comment on Mr. Currie's visit to China. The "Shishi Xinbao" stated that Mr. Currie intends to formulate precise, effective, and concrete plans for aid to China, and can point out appropriate directions for China's economic efforts. The "Dagongbao" stated, "Today, we no longer need to talk about gratitude for aid to China. In a nutshell, the question is how to defeat Japan and pacify the Pacific situation. Since the Washington Conference, the United States has missed opportunities many times. Now the problem has reached a narrow path, and Japan must fail no matter what. But how to achieve this? First, China must not fail. Effective aid to China and even the United States taking action themselves are necessary. The entire Chinese army and people are fighting bravely, and they are bearing the primary responsibility of defending the Pacific. And the ultimate responsibility for pacifying the Pacific situation has fatefully fallen on the shoulders of the United States. We respectfully hope that Mr. Currie will assist President Roosevelt in this great endeavor." The "Xinhua Daily" also attaches great importance to Mr. Currie's visit and advocates for cooperation with the Soviet Union, reaffirming the Communist Party's position of resolutely following Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People, adhering to the policy of the National United Front, fearing no difficulties, and having unwavering confidence in victory.

Washington - According to newspapers affiliated with the Scripps-Howard syndicate, Japan is currently considering formally declaring war on China in order to demand belligerent rights and establish a blockade of Rangoon in the Indian Ocean. However, Japan first requested that Berlin pressure the Soviet Union to stop supplying China and to conclude a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty. Germany is currently striving to facilitate this agreement so that Japan will have a free hand to contain the United States in the Pacific and obstruct its continued aid to China. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Tokyo - The "Hochi Shimbun" published an editorial today discussing Japan's southward advance policy, stating that it is obvious that Japan must find a way out in the South Seas, which needs no further explanation. The editorial stated, "Our country is now concentrating all its efforts on building a so-called 'highly tense nation.' This requires obtaining sufficient natural resources. Therefore, if we want to implement a southward advance, we must immediately resolve the various problems that hinder it. Japan's current tasks are threefold: (1) Resolving the 'China Incident,' (2) Adjusting Japanese-Soviet relations, and (3) Reforming the domestic system. As for the China Incident, the fact that it has been prolonged cannot be solely blamed on Prime Minister Konoe. The reason is that we were careless and unaware of its true seriousness, which led to this situation. Fortunately, we have a good grasp of the military aspects, which is somewhat comforting. However, there are many problems other than military ones that need to be resolved urgently. The reason why the current situation is still chaotic and why Japan is still suffering is all due to this. As for Japanese-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union is eyeing us in the north, posing a great threat to Japan. We have no choice but to station a large number of troops on the northern border to guard against unforeseen circumstances. Therefore, before advancing south, we must reach a compromise with the Soviet Union to withdraw these troops from the border. This is very clear. As for the reform of various domestic systems, it is not yet perfect. Before starting the great task of advancing south, we must gather the enthusiasm of the people and establish a new system, which is an urgent matter." (Havas dispatch, 7th)

The South Seas are important to Japan both economically and strategically. (Haitong dispatch, 8th)

This further proves that Osami was leading his staff to assume command of the Combined Southern Fleet in order to launch a southward advance. Unexpectedly, he died en route after taking off from Guangzhou towards Hainan Island at noon that day. Osami was born in the 9th year of Meiji (1876), is 65 years old, and graduated from the Naval War College. He served as a military attache in France, is fluent in French, and has served as Naval Minister in the Inukai, Saito, and Okada Cabinets.

Editorial

### Starting with the Repeated Defeats of the Italian Army

Italy has fared poorly in the Balkan campaign, is facing a blockade in the Mediterranean, and is suffering defeats in North and East Africa. Its army seems unable to withstand a major war, and the commanders at the front have been repeatedly replaced, even three or four times. All of this reveals numerous weaknesses. As for the air force, despite its self-proclaimed excellence, it has achieved nothing of substance. Shortly after the start of the war, Italian Air Marshal Balbo died in a mysterious plane crash. Even the Minister of Foreign Affairs has now taken on the role of bomber squadron leader, indicating a lack of talent. The navy is clearly inadequate. For eight months, it has not only been silent and inactive,不敢出戰， even hiding in Taranto, where more than half of it was destroyed by the British. Although the situation in Albania has stabilized somewhat recently, there has been no news of any special victories taking advantage of the sudden death of Greek Prime Minister Metaxas. On the contrary, in North Africa and East Africa, which have been supposedly cultivated for many years, defeats have been repeated. Not only has the capital of Cyrenaica, Benghazi, fallen after Tobruk and Derna, but Eritrea and Italian Somaliland are also facing emergencies. And Abyssinia, conquered years ago, is both under attack from the British and South African forces from the north and south and is also severely threatened by Emperor Selassie's efforts to restore the country. Looking at the overall situation in the African campaign these days, it confirms the speculation of some British military experts yesterday, leading to suspicions that, under the panic of having their return route cut off, the Blackshirts may completely abandon their positions in Africa.

Of course, it seems too early to assert that Italy has already been defeated. It is likely that the clever Hitler has already taken a reverse-takeover approach, "borrowing" Italy's air force bases and sending many "experts" to Italy to "help." Under this form of disguised supervision, unless a revolution occurs within the Italian nation, it seems unimaginable that the Rome government under Mussolini will be the first to "sue for peace" due to military defeats. However, from the British perspective, it is not difficult to see clearly that the London government, while adopting a defensive posture in the British Isles, preparing to deal with a German landing or large-scale air raid, is indeed adopting an offensive posture in the Mediterranean, with the ambition to quickly destroy Italy's entire war effort and force Rome to "yield" first.

Originally, the British war against the Axis powers in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean could no longer attempt to attack the continent due to France's armistice. In order to gain the initiative, they had no choice but to turn to the Mediterranean coast and attack the weaker link in the Axis, Italy. If Britain were to defeat Italy, it would not only passively dismantle the Axis line, reducing the constraints on the war against Germany, but also actively gain many practical benefits, which could shorten the path to final victory.

First, if Italy surrenders, part of its naval strength could be transferred to Britain. In this way, the London government could not only withdraw most of its warships from the Mediterranean Fleet to confront Germany in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, but also free up some strength to strengthen the Far East Fleet, thereby suppressing Japan's蠢動 towards the South Seas.

Second, if Italy surrenders, the Mediterranean would truly become a "British lake." If the French and Spanish fleets continue to remain neutral, British merchant ships could travel unhindered in the Mediterranean, and the routes to the Far East and India would be shortened by more than half because they would no longer have to go around the Cape of Good Hope. Shortening and maintaining sea routes are not only of commercial value, of course.

Third, strategically speaking, if the Mediterranean is completely controlled by Britain, then the attitudes of the various powers around the Mediterranean would inevitably undergo major changes. According to the estimation of Major Allie Ewart, a military reporter for the New York "Min Sheng Jiang Tan Bao," not only would Spain become more "pro-British," but all French territories in North Africa would be more supportive of Pétain, resisting Germany's demands. Even the Balkans would be affected, allowing the countries of Southeast Europe to resolutely resist Axis pressure in the future, and Syria would purely become a sphere of influence for Britain and Turkey.

In summary, it can be seen that if Britain can defeat Italy first, it can obtain the above-mentioned benefits. In other words, if Italy loses, Hitler would have to endure the above-mentioned disadvantages. This is why, after observing the Italian-Greek war for more than two months, he finally had to change his policy and take active action to aid Italy. His first step was to withdraw part of the strength from the German Air Force and use Italy's bases to directly attack British fleets and merchant ships in the Mediterranean. This is something that the British Mediterranean Fleet cannot ignore. As US Rear Admiral Sterling stated yesterday, a fleet operating near an enemy air force base without sufficient air force protection is simply a "target" for enemy aircraft and is bound to be greatly troubled. Therefore, the need for the British Air Force to be replenished in large quantities has reached a stage of "extreme urgency." As for why Hitler has intensified his pressure on the Vichy government in recent days, attempting to obtain the remaining French fleet and use its ports, it shows how eagerly he wants to save Italy's decline in the Mediterranean. Because if he can use the French and Italian fleets, in conjunction with the German and Italian air forces, and with the French and Italian ports as bases, Hitler can indeed compete with Britain for air and sea control in the Mediterranean.

While Germany is intensifying its actions in the Mediterranean, it can still launch offensives in the English Channel or the Balkan Peninsula at any time to divert attention. There is no doubt that, on the eve of this final struggle of the Axis powers and the expansion of various fronts, the eyes of the world cannot help but focus on the pivotal United States. Because how the Washington government will actively assist Britain to seize the initiative has indeed become a turning point in the future evolution of the European and African war situation, and even the situation in the Far East.

### Non-Applicability of Lend-Lease to the Soviets; US House Rejects; Ban on US Ships Sailing in War Zones; Passed After Fierce Debate

Washington - The House of Representatives yesterday continued its heated debate on the President's Lend-Lease Act, having passed an amendment regarding the prohibition of American ships sailing in designated war zones, stipulating that the various measures of the Lend-Lease Act shall not alter the provisions of the Neutrality Act.  Another amendment, proposing to exclude the Soviet Union from the countries to be aided under the Lend-Lease Act, was voted down by 185 votes to 94.  The bill was proposed by Congressman Tinkham, a Republican from Massachusetts, who claimed that the Soviet Union opposes everything that is British. Government officials urged Congress not to pass it, otherwise it would force the Soviet Union into the embrace of the Axis powers. Congressman Johnson, a Democrat from Texas, said, "If the House passes this bill, it would be an unwarranted slap in the face to the Soviet Union. At a time when Germany, Italy, and Japan are trying to woo the Soviet Union into the Axis, if the United States suddenly delivers a gigantic slap, Germany and Japan will be overjoyed." Congressman McCormack, a Democrat from Massachusetts, called the bill "unwise and dangerous."  Furthermore, Congressman Rayburn, a Democrat from Texas and the majority leader, stated that the government would firmly resist any new amendments other than those proposed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, including the one proposed by Congressman Wadsworth, a Republican from New York, limiting the appropriation to $700 million. However, if any proposals are acceptable to the Foreign Affairs Committee, the government may allow them to be introduced. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Washington - The House Democratic leadership has decided to submit the Lend-Lease Act to the Senate today without further concessions. Yesterday, while 66 Democratic congressmen were out for dinner, the amendment proposed by Congressman Sikes, a Republican, on Sunday, giving Congress the right to terminate the Lend-Lease Act at any time, was established. However, the Democratic congressional leadership intends to halt this amendment. The House has voted down, by 185 votes to 94, an amendment arguing that the Soviet Union should not be included among the countries that the President deems to have a defense closely related to the national defense of the United States and that can obtain US military equipment. Later, the House also voted down, by 150 votes to 35, an amendment stipulating that "the cession of territory in the Western Hemisphere is one of the methods for foreign countries to repay American aid." (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

Washington - The US House of Representatives last night further restricted by 10% the powers granted to President Roosevelt under the Lend-Lease Act. The House has abandoned the attempt to pass the bill before tomorrow. The House also added a clause to the bill, allowing Congress to terminate the special powers granted to the President under the bill at any time, with the consent of a majority in both the Senate and the House. As for the amendment stipulating that military supplies may not be transferred or sold unless the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Army certify that they are "not important" to US defense, it was rejected by 109 votes to 78. The House also resolved other amendments, including one stipulating that the President may negotiate the purchase of all British territories in the Western Hemisphere. The amendment proposed by Congressman Mundt, a Republican from South Dakota, to limit the appropriation to $2 billion and restrict government loans, was rejected by the House. (International News Service dispatch, 8th)

### US Secretary of War Stimson Refutes Lindbergh's Remarks

Washington - Secretary of War Stimson sent a letter to the Foreign Affairs Committee, stating that the sale of American aircraft to Britain would enable Britain to quickly build up its air force, thereby enhancing its hope of repelling attacks and also enhancing the defense of the United States itself. Aviation expert Williams testified before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, saying that "it is highly doubtful whether Britain can win. Even based on the current war, the destruction of the Hitler regime cannot be achieved without conquering the European continent, but conquering the continent is militarily impossible." He also said, "Not a single squadron of the US Air Force can stand on the European battlefield." Defending British territory and defeating Germany are two completely different things. He cannot say whether Britain can preserve its country, but it is impossible for Britain to defeat Germany. The Lend-Lease Act will weaken the strength of the US Air Force, and the US Air Force is merely a mythical weapon. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

Washington - Colonel Lindbergh's accusation that the US aid-to-Britain program is weakening the US Air Force itself was refuted yesterday by Secretary of War Stimson. Stimson strongly refuted the remarks of this famous aviator, saying that the aid-to-Britain program is actually accelerating the manufacture of American aircraft. Lindbergh testified before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that the situation in Britain is now "desperate." He believes that American aid will not be sufficient for Britain to overcome Germany. Former US Minister to Canada and Commander of the American Expeditionary Force in the First World War, MacNaught, also vehemently criticized the aid-to-Britain bill. He believes that the bill is a "war plan" and pointed out that the bill would deprive the Army and Navy of weapons. Lindbergh said, "If we rely on the victory of foreign troops for our security and deprive the representatives of our people of their power, the United States will encounter danger, because the danger to the United States does not come from abroad." Lindbergh continued, "I do not believe it is possible or necessary for Americans to control the outcome of the European war. Any effort by the United States to simultaneously prepare for the defense of Britain and the Philippines is a reckless attempt." (International News Service dispatch, 8th)

Austin - A proposal has been submitted to the Texas State Legislature requesting the government to demote Colonel Lindbergh from Colonel to Private and send him to the German-controlled area. (United Press dispatch, 8th)

### US Ambassador to Britain Winant to Assume Post in Britain in October; Gauss Has Served in China for Many Years; This Mission to China Will Surely Not Disappoint

Washington - President Roosevelt announced that the new US Ambassador to Britain, Winant, will assume his post in Britain in October. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Washington - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday unanimously approved President Roosevelt's nominations of Winant as Ambassador to Britain and Gauss as Ambassador to China. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee also unanimously passed the nominations of Wilson as Ambassador to Panama, Dawson as Ambassador to Uruguay, and Muccio as Ambassador to the temporary governments of Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In addition, it also approved Johnson as Minister to Australia, Kirk as Minister to Hungary, Maffitt as Minister to Luxembourg, and Fish as Minister to Portugal. It is believed that the Senate will soon approve the nominations approved by the Foreign Relations Committee. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

Washington - After the US government announced the appointment of Gauss as Ambassador to China, the general reaction was that China now has one of the most capable American diplomats as its ambassador. The Washington Star said that the exchange of ambassadors between China and Australia allows Johnson to get some rest from his hectic life in Chongqing. At the same time, we are not using an inexperienced diplomat as our representative to China, as Gauss has been working in China as a leader for many years. People here generally believe that Johnson, who has been living in a "hot money" environment for a long time, should get a rest to relieve the hardships he has suffered in the wartime capital of China, which is constantly bombed. Gauss has served in various parts of China for many years and has achieved remarkable results, which has been praised by people, especially when he was the Consul General in Shanghai. In less than a year, he was promoted from Consul General to Ambassador, which is rare in the American diplomatic community, but his friends are confident that Gauss will not disappoint. It is said that the Japanese praised Gauss's political achievements in China and gave him special commendations, which is an honor for Gauss. According to "Life" magazine's comment on Gauss's mission to Australia, "He is upright and does not fear people or ghosts." (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

### Eastern Libya Completely Under the Control of British Forces; Italy's Thirty Years of Rule Comes to an End; Fierce Fighting Underway in the Battle for Abyssinia

London - British military circles claim that the British army's capture of Benghazi, the Italian headquarters in Libya, on Thursday, signifies that the entire eastern territory of Libya is now in the hands of the British army. The British army advanced 160 miles in seven days, with the army, navy, and air force acting together. The navy operated along the coast. At times, the weather was extremely bad, with sandstorms raging. Fortunately, the Italian army's resistance was not very strong. The impact of the British victory is as follows: (1) The enemy has been driven to 700 miles outside Alexandria and 800 miles outside the Suez Canal, making it impossible for the Italian army to conduct large-scale bombing of the British army on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean; (2) Britain has gained an air base to bomb Sicily, Italy (the island is only 450 miles from Benghazi), so the British air force can cooperate with the British fleet's air force in the Mediterranean, and Hitler's plan to use the island to cut off traffic on both sides of the Mediterranean has failed; (3) Italy has lost an important naval port, making it more difficult to supply its troops in Libya, because the British navy constantly monitors the coast from Benghazi to Tripoli; (4) The only way for Hitler to destroy British forces in the eastern Mediterranean is through the Balkans, but even if the Nazis can capture Istanbul, it is still 800 miles from Suez. (Associated Press dispatch, 8th)

Cairo - A British military spokesman claimed today that since the British army has captured Benghazi, the entire region of Cyrenaica, except for a few isolated outposts west of Benghazi, is now in British hands. People here generally believe that the Italian side had no intention of defending Benghazi. The slight resistance at Derna was probably intended to give the Italian army time to escape. As there is still little news coming from Benghazi, it is not yet known how many of the Italian divisions stationed around the city are left. The British army's occupation of Benghazi not only marks the end of Italy's thirty years of rule over Cyrenaica, but also provides a 3-400 mile stretch of land with very little drinking water, creating an obstacle to prevent the Italian side from attacking Egypt from Tripoli. People here are now focusing on Abyssinia, as all traffic between Abyssinia and Italy has now been cut off since the loss of Benghazi. Important battles are currently underway on the Abyssinian front. The Italian army clearly lacks fighting spirit, and many are surrendering. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

London - A Reuters correspondent with the South African army in Abyssinia reports that the battle for Abyssinia is underway. A large South African British army has invaded from Kenya and occupied an Italian army's strong outpost in the Gora-hai volcano crater, 20 miles inside the border. The Italian army suffered heavy losses in manpower and materials. The casualties were 30 on each side, and 47 were captured. The South African army was divided into two teams that entered at the same time. The first team aimed to occupy the Italian army's fortified position in the Aare-Algrimmo area, and the second team aimed to occupy the Gora-hai front line. Both tasks were completed on the same day. Aare-Algrimmo was occupied at 4 pm, and Gora-hai fell one hour later. The one that occupied Gora-hai was a young South African soldier, formed a team when the war broke out, never participated in the war, so he lacked experience, but the commander commanded properly, and the soldiers were brave and took the lead, so he had this victory. First, there was a small contact, and the artillery team bombarded the Italian army's trenches and fortresses. Soon, the British army launched an attack, and after a fierce battle of 50 minutes, Gora-hai was captured. The place is an extinct volcano, and the crater has water containing sulfur, and there is almost no drinking water to be found anywhere around it. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Cairo - A communiqué describing the capture of Benghazi states that the British armored car convoy advanced 150 miles in 30 hours, eliminating enemy resistance along the way and approaching the final line of retreat. The enemy army was shocked by this rapid battle result and was surrounded before it could retreat. Therefore, the enemy armored forces, which were larger in number, supplemented by infantry and artillery, fought hard to break through, but were all defeated and suffered heavy losses. The enemy army finally stopped resisting after 60 of its tanks were destroyed. A large number of troops surrendered, including one enemy general and one corps commander, as well as many other senior officers. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Britain Studies Strategy; Attack on Tripoli

London - A Reuters military commentator said that the fall of Benghazi was expected, but it fell faster than most people expected. The Italian army's resistance in Cyrenaica must have completely collapsed by now. Since the British army's capture of Derna, the Italian army has only engaged in rear-guard warfare once. The British army seems to have no other obstacles except for being tired from the rapid advance. It is now a matter of concern whether the remaining Italian troops in the Cyrenaica region will surrender around Benghazi or attempt to retreat a long distance to Tripoli. If they retreat, they will be harassed and attacked by the British air force, and even ambushed day and night by hostile Arabs along the way. Whether the British army will advance to Tripoli is a major strategic issue that remains to be decided. At that time, the British staff will have to put a lot of effort into organizing supply lines. However, Britain's control of the sea and air in North Africa will provide significant assistance to the army. According to the news received, the Italian side has failed to assemble a large army to defend Tripoli. Under these circumstances, a continued advance by the British army is not overly dangerous strategically and there are many reasons why it must be advanced. Once the British army occupies Tripoli, its benefits will not only have a great spiritual impact on the Italians and the world, including Britain's other enemies, but it will also be important for seizing a good port, which is very important for the British navy's strategy of operating in the central and eastern Mediterranean. The airfield there is closer to Malta and Sicily than any airfield that can currently be obtained, so it is worth occupying. Furthermore, attacking at this moment can at least prevent the Germans from occupying the area, which is also an important goal. The total collapse of the Italian side is not limited to Libya. The British army's attack into Abyssinia has been swift and successful, and since the British army's offensive in Eritrea began, it has captured another 3,500 enemy troops. The Italian army in Africa seems unable to resist for long. Even if they try to defend Keren or Asmara, the British army can also take the two key locations from the south. At the same time, the Greek army in Albania has overcome the great difficulties of cliffs, heavy snow, and dangerous roads, and is expected to attack the more open coastal area soon and capture Vlora and Durrës at an early date.

British Army Wins by Surprise; Establishes Great Achievement

London - A Reuters correspondent reports from the British Middle East Command that the British Imperial forces are advancing at an unprecedented rate in North Africa, launching lightning-fast strikes. On Thursday, in the blinding wind and sand, they captured Benghazi, the last stronghold of the Italian army in eastern Libya. It is believed that the Italian army's resistance was minimal. In less than two months since the British army launched its offensive, it has advanced to 400 miles from Sidi Barrani and 100 miles from Alexandria. The magnitude of its victory can be imagined. Today, British troops can be seen coming and going on the palm-lined thoroughfares of Benghazi, proving to the confused residents that the Italian Empire has collapsed. Although the capture of Benghazi was extremely rapid, the British side had already prepared a complete plan for managing the occupied areas. The details will be announced by the special official. Recalling the entire Libyan campaign, British tanks have played a great role, advancing hundreds of miles, breaking through enemy lines, and completely surprising the enemy, causing enemy cities to fall one after another. The British army's advance in Libya not only advanced along the coastal road, which is difficult to travel, but also advanced rapidly along the inland road that crosses the Cyrenaica region behind the mountain ridge. The capture of Benghazi is another great strategic achievement, comparable to the capture of Sidi Barrani. The Italian army initially expected the British army to attack along the coastal roads in the countryside, which are extremely difficult to travel, but unexpectedly, the British armored forces set out from El Merj and advanced rapidly along the arid desert path (these paths are usually only occasionally traveled by camel caravans) for 130 miles, enabling them to attack Benghazi from the east, like a bolt from the blue in the Sahara. The Italian army did not expect the British army to advance so quickly, so it was panicked and unable to resist. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

British Air Force Conducts Extensive Activities in Africa

Cairo - A communiqué from the British Air Force Middle East Command describes the British army's activities before the capture of Benghazi, stating that on Wednesday, British bombers attacked Benghazi, Berka, and Jedabia at night, dropping tons of bombs and inflicting heavy damage. One enemy aircraft was shot down and destroyed. British fighters continued their offensive patrols, strafing Benina airfield, destroying several enemy aircraft on the ground. British aircraft patrolled over Benghazi and did not encounter any enemy resistance. As for Italian East Africa, South African British Air Force squadrons engaged enemy fighters while patrolling near Asmara, shooting down two of them. The squadron also launched an aerial attack on Balda airfield, destroying three enemy aircraft and setting off a large fire in the gasoline depot. Keren was also attacked by British aircraft, with the railway and military buildings being the most heavily bombed. Bombs also fell on the transport yard in Assab. Military targets west of Tobruk in Albania were bombed on Thursday. Ammunition depots and motor transport vehicles were hit by many bombs. The weather was very bad during the air strikes, but the British aircraft suffered no losses. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Frequent Reports of Victory in North Africa; Great Joy Everywhere

Melbourne - Major General Sturdee, commander of the Australian army, who arrived here from the Middle East last month, said today after receiving news of the capture of Benghazi, "This is a great effort. Our army advanced as fast as a motor race, and the elimination of the Italian army was very fast." Australian Acting Prime Minister Fadden said that he was delighted by the magnificent victory of the Australian army. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

Athens - A cable from Athens reports that Athens received the news of the British army's occupation of Benghazi with great joy and enthusiasm. People generally believe that the British army commander's use of strategy will enable him to capture Benghazi, the Italian army's extremely important naval and military center, but the Italian army did not expect the British army to advance so quickly. The Italian expatriates in the African cities and towns occupied by the British army have expressed comfort to the British army that went to liberate them, which is of great significance. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)

New Delhi - The news of the fall of Benghazi came as a surprise to New Delhi, as people here did not initially know that the British Imperial forces had penetrated so far. Indians are paying more and more attention to the African war because the Indian army has achieved significant results in the African war.

European War Talks (23)

### US Diplomacy Secrets

The situation changes in an instant. On April 5th, Italy mobilized its troops and invaded Albania, occupying the entire territory within two days. German troops began maneuvers, and Britain and France were deeply concerned that the Soviet Union would take advantage of their unpreparedness and preemptively strike. By April 11th, Italy had called up soldiers born in 1910 and 1914, and seven German divisions had concentrated on the Polish border. At this point, the pessimism of the European situation reached its peak.

The President, as usual, asked the ambassadors stationed in European countries over the Atlantic telephone if there was any way to save the situation. The ambassadors replied as before, "It is difficult to reverse the situation without significant action," and any action was not something the United States could agree with at that time. However, the President was not discouraged and still held onto the hope of using his personal capacity to send a telegram to Hitler and Mussolini, asking them to guarantee that they would not attack other countries.

The telegram was not drafted until the 13th. On that day, the President, Hull, and Welles read the telegram carefully again. Hull believed that the timing for sending the telegram was not yet ripe, but the President did not want to miss the opportunity and ordered it to be sent to Rome and Berlin. The President originally hoped that this decisive appeal could achieve a once-and-for-all result, or at least a satisfactory one. However, the reality was the opposite. After a temporary silence, Mussolini and Hitler replied one after another through speeches. Afterwards, the President also summoned the Italian Ambassador Colonna and told him in a gentle but firm tone that Mussolini's failure to reply in writing was a breach of international etiquette. The State Department also expressed the same regret to the German Chargé d'Affaires Thomson. (To be continued)

In mid-April 1939, the European crisis became increasingly urgent. President Roosevelt and Hull seriously discussed how to deal with the situation. The President still had doubts about the British and French authorities' policy of abandoning compromise. Hull, on the other hand, was more certain and believed that the danger of war breaking out was greater than the President acknowledged and that abolishing the arms embargo could increase the chances of peace. After careful consideration, the President agreed. So the two began to persuade the wavering members of the Senate and House of Representatives.

They wasted a lot of breath and only ended up disappointed. The House Foreign Affairs Committee passed an amendment equivalent to rejection late one night at the end of June, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 12 to 11 on July 11 to shelve the repeal of the arms embargo.

Despite the unfavorable situation, the President and Hull were not discouraged and decided to convene key senators for a meeting at the White House to discuss remedial measures. The President, as usual, explained the crisis of war to them and made a defense of abolishing the arms embargo. The senators listened for a full hour, and at the end, the President said that he had exhausted his wisdom and strength in mediating peace, and therefore said, "This is my last resort. After this, I will have to start all over again." "Mr. President," Senate Republican leader McNary interjected, "do you think that war is certain to break out between now and the next regular session of Congress?" "I'm not saying it's certain to break out," the President replied, "but I'm sure there's a very high probability."

Hull continued to speak, saying that war would break out in late summer or early autumn, and that abolishing the arms embargo would at least halve the crisis of war. The relationship between the United States and this war was significant. The more he spoke, the more passionate he became, and his emotions became uncontrollable. At first, no one interrupted him, but later, Senator Borah, the old general of the isolationist faction, known for opposing the United States joining the League of Nations, finally couldn't bear it and released his theory.

"No one can predict what will happen in the future," he interrupted Hull, "but as I see it, we won't encounter any war. Germany is not preparing for war either."

"I hope you will come to my office and read the telegrams sent from overseas," Hull replied in a sad and patient tone. "I can be sure that at that time, his conclusion will definitely admit that the danger of war is far beyond what he imagined."

"I don't care what the reports in the State Department say," Borah replied firmly. "I have my own intelligence, and several times I have found that my own intelligence is more reliable than that of the State Department."

After Borah said these shocking words, the whole room was silent. Hull couldn't help but shed tears in his eyes. When someone asked Hull for his opinion again, he said sadly that he could no longer say anything after having been lectured by Borah. Fortunately, Vice President Garner, who had always been an optimist, came out to smooth things over. The President, leaning back on the sofa and smoking a cigarette, had expected from the beginning that this meeting would not have any good results. Despite Hull's sadness, he still calmly replied to Garner that he had done his best, and now the Senate must take responsibility. Borah also interjected that there was "nothing difficult" about this matter, and the meeting ended hastily. (To be continued)

### Albanian Frontline: Greek and Italian Troops Engage in Bayonet Combat, Italian Troops Retreat from Tepelene, Corpses Litter the Field, Many Captured

London - Athens Radio reports: Yesterday, the weather on the Albanian front was still bad. Italian troops, assisted by artillery fire, desperately attacked for two hours without success. A large vanguard of infantry was strafed by Greek troops, corpses littered the field, and they were finally driven back. Greek troops charged with bayonets, pursuing the Italian troops behind the line, capturing many Italian troops and seizing a large number of war materials. (Reuters, 8th)

London - According to a Reuters dispatch from the Albanian border, Italian troops in Tepelene, an important town in Albania, have retreated. (Reuters, 8th)

Sofia - According to news from the Yugoslav-Greek border, Valona on the Adriatic coast was bombarded by long-range artillery from Greek troops yesterday. (Haitong, 8th)

### Greek King Inspects Troops at the Front

Athens - King George of Greece recently went to the Albanian front to inspect the troops. The officers and soldiers of the three services were extremely excited. Many soldiers rushed to the side of his car, shouting the slogan "We will throw the Italian troops into the sea!" The King inspected most of the troops, all the way to the front line. He spoke with the commanders and awarded medals to junior officers and soldiers who had fought bravely. Wherever the King went, he was filled with an atmosphere of loyalty, joy, and enthusiasm. (Reuters, 8th)

### British Colonial Secretary: Moyne Succeeds

London - Former Army Secretary Lord Moyne was appointed Colonial Secretary today to succeed the late Lord Lloyd. He has been sworn in at the Privy Council. Mr. Moyne has held various government positions, including Minister of Agriculture, and has served on several government committees. In 1932, he served as a member of the Finance Committee sent to Kenya, and in 1938, he served as Chairman of the West Indies Royal Commission, traversing all parts of the Empire.

In addition to the news of Mr. Moyne's appointment, other cabinet reshuffles were announced today. Mr. Brown has been appointed Minister of Health, and Mr. MacDonald, who originally held the position, has been transferred to Commissioner to Canada. The position of Secretary of State for Scotland has been filled by Johnston. After Mr. MacDonald goes abroad, he will retain his seat in the House of Commons. Lord Moyne will succeed the late Lord Lloyd as Leader of the House of Lords, with Major Cater as Deputy Leader. The Duke of Norfolk is appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, and Major Lloyd George is appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Food.

### Pressure from Germany Forces the Puppet Government to Accept All Demands, Darlan Returns to Vichy to Report on Negotiations, Weygand Denies Tunisia's Cession to Germany, British Ultimatum to Syria Unconfirmed

Swiss Capital - Yesterday, a qualified neutral source here revealed to a reporter from the International News Service the full extent of the demands made by Germany and Italy to France (including Germany's use of the French fleet and naval bases, and the cession of important areas of France and its colonies to Italy). It is revealed that Laval is willing to hand over the entire French fleet to Germany as soon as he gains control of the Vichy government or the puppet regime in Paris supported by Germany. It is also learned that Italy's demands include the cession of Corsica and a part of the French coast west to Toulon, as well as France's full cooperation when the Axis powers attack Britain. It is said that French Prime Minister Marshal Pétain is fully opposed to this demand and is supported by the United States. It is said that the US Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, is now in close contact with the elderly Pétain, but powerful elements in the government support Laval. They often want to reach a full understanding with Germany and want to impose a purely fascist government on the country. (International News Service, 8th) Vice Admiral Darlan, the Minister of the Navy of Vichy, went to Paris twice to meet with former cabinet member Laval and the German authorities, and has now returned here today. (Havas, 8th)

Vichy - There has been no change in the French political situation today. No changes are expected until Vice Admiral Darlan returns here from Paris tomorrow night. Vice Admiral Darlan had a meeting with Brinon, the French government's commissioner in the occupied zone, in Paris, and will also meet with Laval, the former cabinet member and foreign minister. The motive for all these talks is that the French government feels uneasy about domestic unity and Franco-German relations. As for the rumors that Germany has made certain demands on France regarding the Mediterranean, they are not true. As evidenced by the statement made yesterday by General Weygand, the commissioner of the French government in Africa, the claim that Bizerte in Tunisia would be ceded to Germany can be refuted. Also, Paris: A newspaper claimed that the British government had issued an ultimatum demanding that France hand over three destroyers and three submarines stationed in the Near East to Britain. Those responsible here are also unaware of this claim, and said that the only French shipping issue in the Near East that remains to be resolved is the obstruction of the French ship "Providence" by the British, but the reasons cited by the British are not acceptable to the French authorities of the Syrian Republic. (Havas, 7th)

### Churchill Scheduled to Broadcast Speech Today

London - It was recently announced that Prime Minister Churchill will broadcast a speech to the country and overseas on the BBC at 8 pm on the 9th of this month. (Reuters, 8th)

### British Air Force Night Raid on the French Coast, Boulogne Ablaze

London - British bombers soared across the English Channel last night, launching an unprecedentedly fierce bombing raid on the German invasion port on the French coast, dropping various bombs like raindrops. Fires broke out in many places. The center of the attack seemed to be in the Boulogne area, which had also been heavily bombed the night before. Yesterday, the English Channel was shrouded in dense fog, but it cleared slightly at night. British aircraft went on a raid, having to drop flares to find their targets, resulting in a terrible barrage of anti-aircraft fire. Seen from the southeast coast of England, tracer bullets crisscrossed, anti-aircraft shells burst into flames, and the explosions of giant bombs could be heard across the Channel. The sky over the bombed area was illuminated by flashes of light from time to time. An hour after the British attack, two clusters of flames shot out from somewhere east of Boulogne, followed by violent explosions. The doors and windows of houses on the coast of Kent felt the tremors, and soon the sky was red, indicating a large fire. The flames were suppressed by the dense fog in the Channel and could not be seen clearly. (Reuters, 8th)

### Active Preparations for Municipal Council Election, US Community Presumes Candidates, Allman and McMullen Elected, British and Japanese Residents Will Also Convene Meetings

Since the Municipal Council announced that April 2nd and 3rd would be the dates for the next Municipal Council Board election, foreign residents in this city have been preparing to participate in the election. The American Community Association first held a meeting the day before yesterday, according to the seat ratio of five, two, and two for British, American, and Japanese representatives, to presume Allman and McMullen as candidates for the American board members, and agreed on a strategy to cope with the election. As for the British and Japanese Residents Associations, it is said that meetings will be convened soon, but the date of the meeting has not yet been decided, because the Japanese are currently busy with the Residents Group election. It is believed that the British candidates will follow the usual practice of being five in number, while the Japanese were originally two, but since last year there was an ambition to seize five seats, but failed to achieve their wish, this year it seems that a new strategy will be adopted to overwhelm the British and Americans. Therefore, the candidates recommended by the Japanese will still be five. Since the British and Americans are unwilling to give up the directorships and allow the Japanese to control the administration of the concession, the competition this year will be even more intense than in previous years.

Candidate Names Must Be Submitted by Deadline

Danish Consul General to Shanghai and Leader Consul Hill issued an announcement stating, "To all national consulates, according to Article 9 and Article 6A of the Yangjingbang Charter, it has been decided that April 2nd (Wednesday) and April 1st (Tuesday) will be the dates for the election of directors and land committee members for 1941. The list of the aforementioned candidates should be submitted no later than 12 noon on March 25th" to the Chairman and Secretary-General of the Municipal Council at 209 Jiangxi Road, and must not be delayed.

Electoral Roll Being Compiled

The Municipal Council also issued an announcement stating, "Anyone or any firm not listed in the final confirmed electoral roll will not have the right to vote. This list will be published after March 1st and posted in the reception room of the Municipal Council Building at 109 Jiangxi Road and in each police station, and will be distributed to the consulates, foreign institutions, and clubs. Anyone or any firm wishing to be included in the final electoral roll and changing landowners and addresses must notify the Rates Office before March 2nd. All applications after that date will be invalid. If any errors or omissions are found in the preliminary electoral roll published on December 31, 1940, they should be reported to the Deputy Director of the Rates Office immediately."

American Community Presumes Two Candidates

It was learned yesterday that the American Community Association of this city held a meeting of the Executive Committee on the 7th, recommending Mr. Allman, an American lawyer in this city, and Dr. McMullen, the chairman of the American Community Association and the president of Hangzhou Zhijiang University, as candidates for the next American board member of the Municipal Council. Both gentlemen are well-known in Shanghai. Allman is currently an American board member of the Municipal Council. In last year's Municipal Council election, Allman received the most votes among the American board members. It is said that McMullen's nomination as a candidate must be approved by the authorities of his church. People in this city believe that the church authorities will approve it. It is the first time that an American missionary has been nominated to participate in the Municipal Council board election. It is said that the American Community Association is now suggesting to the Municipal Council that McMullen fill the vacancy left by the American board member Curnow, who resigned at the beginning of this week and will soon return to the United States.

McMullen Highly Reputed

Dr. McMullen, also known as Mingside, belongs to the American Southern Presbyterian Church. He came to China from the United States thirty years ago and engaged in missionary work in Hangzhou. He served as pastor of the Hangzhou Presbyterian Church and executive director of the Hangzhou YMCA. He interacted closely with the Chinese and was proficient in Chinese. Eight years ago, he was assigned by the church to return to Zhijiang University at Zhakou, Hangzhou, as director of school affairs and director of affairs. He was also the pastor of Zhijiang Tangshi (Church). Later, due to the outbreak of war, the school moved from Hangzhou to Shanghai to open. Principal Li Peien asked for leave of absence, and McMullen took over as acting. Since coming to Shanghai, McMullen has been quite active in American community groups. Last year, he was elected chairman of the American Community Association. He is eloquent and humorous. Although he is nearly sixty years old, he is in high spirits. This time, he has the honor of being a candidate for the board of directors, and the American community in this port is deeply gratified.

Formal Suggestion, Date of Annual Meeting

It is also said that the Municipal Council formally suggested to the Shanghai Consular Body yesterday that the annual meeting of foreign ratepayers should be held on April 16. This suggestion from the Municipal Council was given to Danish Consul General and Leader of the Consular Body Hill. It is hoped that formal permission can be obtained at the beginning of next week. Since the Municipal Council board election date has been decided to be April 2nd and 3rd, the expatriate committees of various countries in Shanghai have taken preliminary steps to recommend board member candidates, such as the American Community Association, which held a meeting yesterday. British and Japanese community groups will also meet soon to recommend candidates, but the meeting dates are not yet known, and the exact number of British and Japanese board member candidates to be recommended is also unknown. However, it is generally believed that both the British and Japanese sides will follow the usual practice of each nominating five candidates to participate in the Municipal Council board election.

### Assessor Candidates of Consular Court Presumed, British Consul-General Appointed as President

The Municipal Council has recently received notification from the Leader Consul that the assessor candidates for this year's Consular Court have been presumed as follows: British Consul-General George (also President), Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi, American Consul-General Lockhead, with Lang serving as Secretary.

### Negotiations on Police Authority in the Northern District Are Underway, Major Bowan Has Formally Denied

It is rumored that after the signing of the police agreement for the area outside the boundaries of the western Shanghai, the plan to establish a "new police district" in the northern district is also underway. The new police district, namely "District E," will employ one Japanese deputy police chief and a large number of Japanese police officers. However, Major Bowan, the chief of the police department of the Municipal Council, has denied this statement. It is claimed that he knows of no sign that these negotiations are currently underway.

### Curnow Retires and Returns to the United States, Chinese Host Banquet to Say Farewell, More Than Ten Groups Participated in Great Splendor, Seats and Exquisite Souvenirs Presented, Mr. Curnow is Scheduled to Depart from Shanghai Tomorrow Morning

The Bank Association of this port, the Silver Coin Industry Association, and the Citizens' Federation, and more than ten other organizations, held a farewell banquet for Mr. Curnow, the Deputy Chairman of the Municipal Council, at the residence of Mr. Guo Shun, the Chinese board member of the Municipal Council. In addition to the representatives of the relevant groups, all the Chinese board members of the Municipal Council, such as Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, and Chen RuiRui, also participated. Mr. Curnow was dressed in black with white hair, and his spirit was prominent. During the banquet, there was a lot of talking and laughing, and the cups and wine were exchanged.

Recalling the Past, Reluctant to Part

On that day, Chairman Yu Qiaqing delivered a speech, praising Mr. Curnow's career development and spirit of serving the society in China for more than 30 years. Then, Mr. Curnow gave a reply. In addition to expressing his gratitude for the welcome from various agencies, he also described the past, and his words were quite reluctant to part. Finally, Mr. He Dekui, the Chinese Deputy Secretary-General, represented the entire group in presenting Mr. Curnow with an exquisite souvenir worth 500 gold, and everyone dispersed with applause. Mr. Curnow is the general manager of Mobil Oil Company, an American company in this port. He has been in China for more than 30 years, and his footprints have spread almost all over the provinces. He is very kind to others. He has been a director of the Municipal Council for many years, and last year he was promoted to Deputy Chairman. Now, he has retired due to old age and has resigned from his various concurrent positions. It was originally scheduled to return to the United States at the end of last month, but the Chairman Ke Ziwei was injured in the incident at the Taxpayers' Meeting, and Mr. Curnow took over as acting. Now that the official duties have been completed, it is scheduled to take the American President Line's President Cleveland to return to the United States with his family at 8:45 tomorrow morning. At that time, relatives, friends, and old acquaintances will go to the new customs pier to see him off, waving their handkerchiefs to say goodbye, and there will be a feeling of reluctance to leave.

The Shanghai Times reports that it has been confirmed that a ship of the Ruilin Shipping Company was quarantined by the Japanese naval authorities outside Woosung, and not detained for attempting to smuggle goods to Shanghai as rumored in this city. According to a Japanese spokesman yesterday (7th), one of the passengers on the ship suffered from a rather serious infectious disease, so it was blocked for quarantine within the previous three days. According to rumors, the ship was carrying 300 bags of sugar and some other goods, and after crossing the Japanese blockade line off the coast of Zhejiang, it attempted to smuggle them to Shanghai and was detained as soon as it arrived in Shanghai. Passengers on board have been released, but the ship will be detained for a long time, as the Japanese authorities have a strict attitude towards ships that illegally cross the blockade line.

### Dutch East Indies Restricts Entry of Travelers, Shanghai Travelers Must Apply for Visa One Week in Advance

The Dutch East Indies government has also recently issued an order restricting the entry of foreign travelers to prevent undesirable elements from sneaking into the country and engaging in activities.

According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency who visited the shipping industry yesterday, travelers traveling from Shanghai to various ports in the Dutch East Indies must, one week before boarding, find a reliable guarantor, pay a passport fee and a Dutch Consulate endorsement fee of HK$28.10, and submit five 3.5-inch photos and a certificate from the Municipal Council's Health Bureau proving that they have been vaccinated against smallpox and typhoid fever, which will be sent by the ship they are traveling on to the Hong Kong company, which will obtain a passport endorsed by the Dutch Consulate in Hong Kong on their behalf before they can travel.

### Three and a Half Years Later: The Soviet Ship Arrives in Shanghai for the First Time, Currently Berthing at the Hefeng Factory in Pudong for Repairs, Scheduled to Sail North with Over a Hundred Passengers

Yesterday (the 8th), a Soviet ship flying the Soviet flag was seen in the Huangpu River. This was the first arrival in three and a half years. The ship is the Smoldy, with a deadweight of 5,300 tons. It is currently berthed at the Hefeng Machinery Factory in the Pudong area for repairs and is scheduled to sail north to Vladivostok on the 25th of this month. It is expected to carry 125 passengers leaving Shanghai, mostly Germans.

Repairs Completed, Sailing to Vladivostok

According to a statement from the Shanghai office of the Smoldy yesterday morning, the ship is currently being repaired in Shanghai because such facilities are not currently available in Vladivostok. This statement coincides with recent reports that the Soviet fleet is extensively using shipyards in various Siberian ports. It is reported that the ship can carry passengers directly to Vladivostok. Many Soviet and German expatriates in Shanghai cannot obtain permission to transit through Japan, and this difficulty will be resolved as a result.

Scheduled Flights: No Confirmation Yet

When the reporter inquired with an official at the Soviet ship's management office about the possibility of establishing regular voyages between Shanghai and Vladivostok, the reply was that no confirmation had been received. However, given the lack of cargo ships from the Far East, some Soviet ships may be transferred to the Chinese coast to transport rice and other goods from South China.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Proposal Effective, Rice Market Eliminates Malpractices, Most Foreign Rice Directly Shipped to Shanghai from Origin

To prevent hoarding and speculation of grain, the Shanghai Municipal Council has approved the Grain Committee's recommendation to submit seven measures to the Rice Market Management Committee for implementation. Upon receiving the news, hoarders rushed to release their stocks, and foreign rice prices fell again yesterday. The proposal has clearly been effective. Although the seven measures appear to be old cases, the Rice Market has adopted various measures, but they are limited to one aspect. The regulations for personnel entering the market, such as firms and customers, are not beneficial to the rice market. Moreover, the intermediaries in the guest market are only recommended by the brokers' association. Therefore, this proposal seeking proper guarantees is different. The requirement that the guarantee must be satisfactory to the Rice Industry Association is also different from previous methods. As for shortening the delivery date from ten days to five days after the rice transaction and paying a deposit of five yuan, it is a supplementary statement.

Stop Rice Trading in the Afternoon

Regarding the trading of rice in the afternoon, it has now been revived. It is reported that the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Industry Association, aware of its responsibilities, has not remained indifferent. It sent a letter to the Rice Grain Brokers' Association yesterday, severely questioning them and instructing them to notify their members not to sneak into the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Exchange in the afternoon to secretly trade spot rice. If discovered, they will report it to the concession authorities for legal action and permanently refuse to mediate rice transactions. However, futures sold by foreign firms are not subject to the prohibition, but rice brokers who mediate must hold credentials issued by the foreign firm, otherwise, it will also be considered sneaking into the market. The responsibility for illegal transactions by rice brokers rests with the Rice Grain Brokers' Association.

Sea Defense Situation Unrelated to Rice Transportation

Yesterday's newspaper reported that since the fourth, "Japanese troops have successively landed in Haiphong, and many Japanese warships, including several transport ships, have also been discovered in the waters of Haiphong. It is also said that after the Tokyo Peace Conference ends, Vietnam may allow the Japanese to enter Vietnam." A reporter from the Xinzheng News Agency, in order to clarify whether there would be problems with the source of foreign rice in the future, visited a major rice merchant yesterday. He was told that most of the current sources of foreign rice are shipped directly by sea or by French mail to Shanghai, and only a few pass through Haiphong. Therefore, problems in Haiphong are insufficient to affect the source of foreign rice. However, general rice speculators may take the opportunity to act rashly. All groups responsible for maintaining the people's food supply should pay close attention to this. As for the rice and grain for February that has been approved by the Vietnamese authorities for export from Saigon, it has been shipped to various places as usual.

### Japanese Emperor's Aide-de-Camp Arrives in Shanghai by Plane, Japan Takes Strict Precautions, Blocking All Bridges

The English-language "The China Press" reports that Lieutenant General Ban Hasnnma, the Chief Aide-de-Camp to the Japanese Emperor, is scheduled to fly from Tokyo to Shanghai this afternoon (the 8th), and then proceed to Ningbo for a special meeting. Because the aide-de-camp will arrive in Shanghai, the Japanese side has taken strict precautions in the northern district of the International Settlement, and the bridges over the Suzhou Creek leading into Hongkou have been temporarily closed. It is reported that Chen Gongbo has gone to Ningbo today and is expected to participate in the meeting to be held in Ningbo next week. The nature of the meeting is unknown. The Japanese side in Shanghai is keeping silent about the arrival of the aide-de-camp, but according to unofficial sources, the aide-de-camp may be here to personally investigate the situation and return to Japan to report to the Emperor after the meeting.

### Announcer Appointed as Judge

"The Continental Times" reports that Tiertelburg, who worked as a news announcer at XMHC Radio Station, was formally sworn in yesterday (the 7th) as Deputy Executive Officer of the U.S. Court for China.

It is learned that Mr. Tiertelburg's appointment to this position was recommended by Li Quesun, Executive Officer of the U.S. Court for China, on January 7, and subsequently approved by the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington via radio. According to the announcement of the U.S. Court for China, Mr. Tiertelburg has gained extensive experience in crime prevention and investigation work in the United States, as well as in criminal, civil, and industrial matters, and is well-trained in technical matters such as fingerprinting and ballistics. He is well-suited for this position.

### Yangtze River Not Dredged, Water Flow Rate Doubles Suddenly, Water Volume at Jiaoshan and Madang Drops Sharply

According to a Japanese military spokesman at a press conference the day before yesterday, the water flowing from the Yangtze River into the canal is now more rapid than before, increasing from one and a half nautical miles to three nautical miles, and navigation is becoming increasingly dangerous due to the narrowing of the riverbanks. However, according to observers, the dangerous conditions of the Yangtze River's water flow are actually caused by the Japanese side not dredging it. According to Jianghai Customs, the water volume of the Yangtze River has dropped sharply recently, especially in the waterways of Jiaoshan and Madang. It is difficult for ships to navigate during low tide. As a result, the water level at Wusongkou has also been affected and is quite low. However, as spring tides are about to rise, the above-mentioned shallow water conditions will not last too long.

### Prison Inspection Committee Appointed

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently received a notification from the Consular Body that the members of the committee for inspecting the Shanghai Municipal Council prison for this year have been appointed, including the Polish Consul General, the Portuguese Consul, and the Dutch Deputy Consul.

### Russian Constable Beats and Injures Driver, Arousing the Anger of Colleagues, Public Bus Association Briefly Goes on Strike, Police Promise to Dismiss the Russian Constable

In front of the Jing'an Temple on the Shanghai-West, the police have set up wooden fences and barbed wire, and stationed Chinese and Western detectives to search passing vehicles and pedestrians when necessary. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, a bus No. 1, traveling on that road from west to east, crashed into the barbed wire fence due to careless driving. The Russian constable stationed on the left side stopped the bus and dragged down driver No. 185 on the spot, hitting him violently with a whip, causing his face to bleed profusely. The bus terminal was only a short distance away, and all the drivers and conductors of buses No. 1, No. 2, and No. 7 witnessed the tragic scene and were filled with righteous indignation. They went on strike together. At one point, there were thirty or forty buses parked there. When the company heard the news, they immediately sent staff to negotiate with the police station in charge. After the police chief investigated and found the facts to be true, he promised to dismiss the Russian constable who caused the trouble. The employees then resumed work and restored traffic.

Every morning at 9:00 AM, he goes to the Exchange office at No. 422 Hankou Road. Two months ago, driver Wang Shunxing took sick leave, so Ah Er, a native of Nantong, was hired as Wang's temporary replacement to drive the car.

Kidnapped at the Lane Entrance

Yesterday morning at 8:50 AM, Yin walked out of the villa to the entrance of the lane, intending to get into the car. Unexpectedly, four bandits were lying in wait by the roadside. Three bandits, armed with handguns, stopped Yin, threatened him with their guns, and got into the car first. Then, two bandits followed Yin and sat on both sides of him. One bandit forced Ah Er out of the car and drove off quickly, kidnapping both the person and the car. Ah Er stood dumbfounded at the entrance of the lane, watching the car disappear. He ran back home to report to Yin's family, who reported the situation to the Jing'an Temple police station, asking for their assistance in finding his whereabouts.

Car Found

After receiving the report, the police station, considering the case to be a kidnapping, sent officers to investigate the scene and questioned Ah Er. They have already ordered detectives to investigate the matter strictly. Around 9:30 AM, the car No. 2326, which was hijacked by the bandits, was discovered by a patrol officer on Xiaoshadu Road. The police station notified Yin's family to claim it. As of now, Yin's whereabouts remain unknown.

### Chinese Constable Colludes with Bandits, Arrested for Transporting Guns

### Chinese Constable Wounded After Entering Someone Else's Bedroom Without Reason, Defendant Accuses Constable of Adultery with His Wife

Ding Chengkou, a native of Tongzhou residing at No. 512 Gordon Road, works as a shop clerk in a miscellaneous grain shop, leaving early and returning late every day. The day before yesterday, he returned home at 3:40 PM because he forgot to bring his bicycle light when he left. Unexpectedly, he saw Chinese constable Liu Yongshun No. 2925 walking out of his room. Suspecting improper behavior, he started an argument. Ding immediately held a kitchen knife and slashed at the Chinese constable, causing Liu to be injured in his left arm. Later, Chinese constables No. 1068 and No. 112 arrived and took the injured person to the hospital and took Ding Chengkou, along with the murder weapon, to the Gordon Road police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Peng Qiqi filed a lawsuit for the crime of injury and stated that the defendant was angry and committed the crime because he falsely accused the Chinese constable of improper behavior with his wife. However, according to the defendant's wife, she stated that she did not know the Chinese constable and that there was no improper affair. As Liu's injuries have not yet healed, a request was made to postpone the hearing. According to the defendant's confession, Liu has had an ambiguous relationship with his wife for a long time. He had repeatedly advised him to stop but he would not. He reported it to the police station. When he returned home yesterday, he saw Liu in his room, so he started an argument. The constable held a knife and slashed at him. He was disarmed, and in the struggle, he accidentally injured him. Judge Meng reviewed the confession and instructed the defendant to be held for further questioning of witnesses and rescheduled the hearing for next Wednesday.

Commercial News

### Grain: Foreign Rice Sources Remain Uninterrupted, Various Rumors All Disproved, Hoarders' Tricks Exhausted, Hoarders' Courage Gone

The source of foreign rice in Shanghai continues uninterrupted. Yesterday, the Yihua Shipping Company's Yong Sheng vessel arrived from Hong Kong with 2,826 bags and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Also, the Taikoo Company's Guiyang vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 12,669 bags of foreign rice from Siam, docking at the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. In addition, the Anhui vessel arrived yesterday afternoon and docked at the company's wharf in Pudong. Because it was Saturday afternoon and the office was closed, the exact number of bags of foreign rice loaded on the vessel is unknown and will be reported next Monday. (Zu)

After the foreign rice market turned weak from the prosperous market of the previous dynasty, the market sentiment yesterday was that all the rumors seemed to be castles in the air. Moreover, seeing the reports that the Thai-Vietnamese disputes were about to be resolved and that large batches of sources were continuously arriving, the market suddenly became unstable. At the opening of the morning market, the situation was unusually quiet. Regardless of whether they were local or out-of-town merchants, they all stood by and watched. Although the sellers tried to hold firm, they also followed the wind and changed direction, no longer resisting. The price drop spread frequently. By the middle of the market, each price had fallen close to a yuan. Unexpectedly, the market did not just fail to rise, but the price drop continued one after another. At the close, New Saigon No. 1 resulted in only 82 yuan, falling to 81 yuan, Old 84 yuan, No. 2 79 yuan, falling to 76 and a half yuan, Siamese No. 1, a high of 81 or 82 yuan, falling to 79 yuan, No. 2 77 yuan, Fire twisted 81 yuan, 80 yuan, Small twisted 74 yuan, 73 yuan 7 jiao, Pudong Wharf 72 and a half 72 yuan, Large twisted 72 yuan, Tokyo Pointed 73 yuan, Rice tea 71 yuan to 69 and a half yuan, Broken point a high of 65 yuan falling to 61 yuan. Overall, the above prices are all lower than the previous market by about one and a half yuan. After the short-term futures were sold off by He Yi the day before yesterday, there were more sellers than buyers, and the market was even more unsustainable. The February and March contracts both opened at 87 yuan yesterday, futures 86 yuan 8 jiao to 86 and a half yuan, January 15, 16, 87 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen, totaling 5 or 600 tons opened. The spot rice transaction was less than 5,000 bags.

Although the arrival of thick and thin Japonica rice and other domestic rice continued, it was not much, but because foreign rice turned weak, the sales market was also sluggish. In addition, the market rumors that the source of domestic rice would soon be restored to normal circulation, the owners' minds relaxed. Therefore, although the resulting selling price on the surface seemed similar to the previous market, in reality, depending on the quality of the goods, it was reduced by half a yuan to one yuan. Special original Japonica from Changbang opened at 106 yuan, sold at 102 yuan, Kunshan original white Japonica 104 yuan, sold at 100 yuan to 96 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice sold at 90 yuan and a half yuan, 94 yuan, original package 97 and a half yuan to 17 yuan.

Glutinous rice remained similarly supplied and demanded, with no major gains or losses, but the trend seemed to have turned weaker. The opening price in Hong Kong dollars was still 80 yuan to 78 yuan.

### Amid Falling Rice Prices, Flour Market is Dull

Yesterday, the spot foreign flour market was particularly dull. After the increase in supply from the sale of flour at fixed prices by Chinese factories, the demand in this street decreased sharply, and the appetite of the guest merchants also became sluggish. Therefore, it was difficult to strengthen the market sentiment. However, there were still guests from Qilu asking about the road goods. Over 10,000 bags of February and March and road goods were traded. The current Australian flour Flower Bird Clock Tower brand mutually vilified each other again in the morning, and the later market slightly opened, with the price being 24 yuan 7 or 8 jiao. The road goods price was 24 yuan 1 or 2 jiao, which was also slightly affected by the spot goods. Because of the falling rice prices, the market was dull and lifeless. Over 6,900 bags of flour were sold at fixed prices by Chinese factories, with no temporary changes, and were all supplied for daily use in this street. The sales of this flour to guest merchants have not yet officially started.

Wheat: There were no transactions in the market yesterday, and the market supply had long been exhausted. Chinese factories also did not pay attention to purchasing. Japanese factories only made sporadic retail sales and slightly increased purchases. The limit price was still around 32 yuan. Foreign sources were still on the way. Under the control of a certain party, it would be difficult to develop inland Du wheat for a while.

### Finance A Weakening Trend Appears in Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. The underlying cause for the weakening US and British exchange rates in the unofficial market was an excess of supply over demand. The market generally declined, with the US dollar at 5.34375 yuan and the British pound also at 3 shillings and 34375 pence. The market opened in the morning with Japanese firms and speculators dumping currencies, leading to a decline. Later, rumors spread that Japan was about to formally declare war on China. Whether this news was beneficial or detrimental remained unclear, causing significant uncertainty. However, before the noon closing, Chinese banks sold British pounds, bringing the spot price to 3 shillings and 328125 pence. The closing prices were 3 shillings and 34375 pence for the spot British pound and 5.34375 yuan for the US dollar.

Japanese Merchants Dumped First

Early in the morning, London's major bonds for both near and distant terms fell by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold prices remained stable. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars and Shanghai were flat, while the US dollar was unchanged against the British pound, up two cents against Shanghai, and there was no market against the French franc.

However, the weakening of foreign exchange rates triggered selling pressure, and rumors of Japan formally declaring war on China caused uncertainty and hesitation.

Lantern Markets on the Lantern Festival

Lantern markets are frequently mentioned by reporters, but the origin of lantern markets is rarely discussed. This discussion aims to delve into this topic.

The Lantern Festival has a long history, likely originating from Taoist practitioners. It likely formed during the Tang Dynasty and flourished during the Song Dynasty, continuing to this day. Taoism regards the fifteenth day of the first month as the Upper Yuan, the fifteenth day of the seventh month as the Middle Yuan, and the fifteenth day of the tenth month as the Lower Yuan. The Three Officials, namely the Heavenly Official, the Earthly Official, and the Water Official, are in charge of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Yuan. The emergence of lantern markets in the Tang Dynasty does not mean that there were no lantern displays before the Tang Dynasty. As Li Bai said, "The ancients held candles for night游, and there was a reason for it." Holding candles requires lanterns to protect the flame from extinguishing, which is necessary for night游. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that lanterns were used for entertainment at night. Furthermore, the artistic refinement of lanterns, resulting in various shapes and colors, is a natural progression. The Tang Dynasty inherited traditions from the Six Dynasties and embraced Taoism as its ancestor, leading to the popularity of Taoist beliefs. Taoists believe that the Three Officials can bring blessings to humanity, and the tradition of viewing lanterns during the Three Yuan Festivals led to large-scale lantern displays. The promotion by emperors and the enthusiastic adoption by the people, competing for novelty and variety to prolong the enjoyment of the day, is a common human desire, thus giving rise to the creation of decorative lanterns. Decorative lanterns were not easy to make, so there were those who sought them and those who made and sold them, leading to the emergence of lantern markets.

How do we know that lantern markets had already formed by the Tang Dynasty? We can see this from the fact that Emperor Zhongzong and Empress Wei went incognito to view lanterns on the second and third days of the first month of the fourth year of Jinglong. The emperor and empress going incognito to view lanterns demonstrates the prosperity of lantern markets among the people. Why say they flourished in the Song Dynasty? Because after the Tang Dynasty, lantern displays were common on the night of the fifteenth day of the first month when market gates were opened. In the Song Dynasty, the lantern displays were extended to one day before and after the Lantern Festival, namely the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth days of the first month. Later, it was extended to the seventeenth and eighteenth nights, with the thirteenth day being the "lighting day." Therefore, even today, people still regard the thirteenth day as the "lighting night" and the eighteenth day as the "lantern extinguishing night," based on this tradition. During the Song Dynasty's lantern displays, colorful decorations were erected at the main gate of the palace, creating mountain-shaped lanterns. Stages were set up, and the imperial music department performed various plays. The emperor first went to the towers to observe the performances, then went to the towers or the East and West Corner Towers to drink with his ministers. Foreign guests from various countries performed their native songs and dances below the towers. Mountain sheds were erected at the left and right side gates of Donghua, the East and West Corner Towers, the main streets of the city, and large temples and monasteries, with music and lantern displays. Even the city walls were decorated. It was truly a scene of "fiery trees and silver flowers, the city open all night," illustrating the splendor of lantern displays during the Song Dynasty. Emperor Huizong especially added to the splendor, so the lantern viewing scenes described in "Water Margin" are not mere fabrications.

Not only were lanterns displayed during the Upper Yuan Festival, but also during the Middle and Lower Yuan Festivals, which is what is meant by "viewing lanterns during the Three Yuan." For example, the "History of the Song Dynasty" records that during the Middle Yuan Festival in the second year of the Taiping Xingguo era, the emperor viewed lanterns from the East Corner Tower and hosted a banquet for his officials. During the Lower Yuan Festival in the fifth year, the same lantern displays were held for three nights as during the Middle Yuan Festival. Similarly, the biography of Wu Yue King Qian Chu records that during the Middle Yuan Festival, the capital city displayed lanterns, and Emperor Taizong ordered officials to set up lantern mountains in front of Qian Chu's residence and provide musical entertainment to honor him. Such examples are numerous, which is why it is said that lantern displays flourished during the Song Dynasty. During Emperor Huizong's reign, the palace even used dragon saliva and agarwood shavings mixed with wax to make candles, with hundreds of them arranged in rows, shining brightly and emitting fragrance, unmatched by anything in heaven. After the Southern Crossing, this custom was largely discontinued. Only when Empress Dowager Cao returned to the desert and it coincided with Emperor Gaozong's birthday, Emperor Gaozong spared no expense to celebrate, following the example of the Xuanzheng era. However, only dozens of torches were lit, and the Empress Dowager acted as if she did not notice. Emperor Gaozong offered her a cup of wine and asked, "Does this candle please Your Holy Majesty?" The Empress replied, "Your father-emperor used to set up hundreds of them every night, and all the pavilions were the same." From this, it can be seen how extravagant the lantern markets were during Emperor Huizong's reign.

The custom of the Lantern Festival as a lantern festival has continued to this day. During the Qing Dynasty, there were lantern dances and fireworks displays in the West Factory on the Lantern Festival. The emperor would arrive at the West Factory between 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM, preceded by equestrian performances by the Eight Banners, such as riding while standing on one foot on the saddle, or riding while standing on both feet on the horse's back, or walking while holding onto the saddle and riding alongside the horse, or two people riding towards each other and exchanging positions on horseback, or one person jumping off and another putting on armor on horseback and riding. Once evening arrived, three thousand people would form a line in front of the building to dance with lanterns, singing songs of peace and holding colored lanterns. They would move in circles, each according to their assigned formation. With one turn, the three thousand people would form the character "太" (great); with another turn, they would form the character "平" (peace), and then the characters "萬歲" (ten thousand years); and finally, they would combine to form the phrase "太平萬袋" (peace and prosperity everywhere). This is what the palace poem refers to as "太平萬賞字當中" (the characters for "peace and prosperity" are in the center). After the dance, fireworks would be set off, the sound like thunder, and the firelight illuminated the sky, revealing thousands of red fish leaping in the clouds, a spectacle unparalleled in the world.

According to records, the practice of forming congratulatory phrases in music and dance began during the reign of Emperor Gaozong and Empress Wu Zetian of the Tang Dynasty, in the "Longevity Music" performance. One hundred and forty dancers, wearing golden crowns and five-colored painted clothing, would form characters in their dance formations, changing sixteen times; there were phrases such as "圣超千古" (surpassing the past), "道泰百王" (peace reigns over all kings), "皇帝萬年" (emperor for ten thousand years), and "寳祚彌昌" (imperial throne prosperous). From this, it can be seen that the dance of "Peace and Prosperity" was likely derived from this. (This custom also spread to Goryeo.)

Lanterns are made of paper or silk, with varying degrees of refinement. The lanterns sold in the market include running horse lanterns, lotus lanterns, horse lanterns, rabbit lanterns, crab lanterns, airplane lanterns, painted boat lanterns, and even lanterns shaped like birds, insects, ingots, and coins, in various shapes and colors. However, they are all crude and unremarkable, only suitable for children to play with. In Shanghai, lanterns are typically displayed at the beginning of the lunar new year, on a corner of Fuyou Road and the old schoolyard street, near the Yu Garden, where stalls are set up for sale. Since several department stores on Nanjing Road also sell lanterns, lanterns are also included in the merchandise of large companies. After the August 13th Shanghai Incident, the Yu Garden lantern market dispersed, and most lanterns are now made and sold by paper shops.

The construction of the running horse lantern is quite scientific. A reed cover is used as an axle, which is planted in the lantern. On the face of the wheel, paper strips are obliquely bent and folded, radiating from the center to the circumference of the wheel, resembling a white umbrella. A needle is attached to the lower end of the axle, supported by small clam shells, so that it can rotate freely, and it is enclosed in a paper cylinder. Paper cutouts of people and horses are hung on the edge of the paper reel, suspended from the outside of the paper cylinder. A candle is lit inside the paper cylinder, on a horizontal bar at the lower end of the axle. As the candle flame burns high, the air inside the cylinder expands, and with the effect of hot and cold air exchange, it drives the paper wheel on the top cover, pulling the hanging people and horses, causing them to revolve in a circle, hence the name "running horse lantern." One day, Mr. Zhu Zhiyao was talking about the machinery manufacturing industry, and he mentioned the running horse lantern. Mr. Zhiyao said that the recent new-style turbine for power generation is similar in construction to the paper wheel on the running horse lantern. One is used as the driving force for industry, and the other is only a toy for children. The difference in value cannot be measured.

Early in the morning, various syndicates bought with limited prices. The market sentiment was better before the opening, so it opened at 6,650 yuan. Banks such as Huipiao Dafeng and Tiancheng Deda continued to buy, rising another 5 yuan to 6,655 yuan. Subsequently, reports of weakening foreign exchange rates caused many sellers from banks and securities firms to gather, and Xinyuan also sold, causing the price to fall sharply, eventually falling below 6,600 yuan to 6,598 yuan. Thanks to Chengji and Baokang, the price soon rebounded above 6,600 yuan, reaching 6,615 yuan. Unexpectedly, rumors of Japan formally declaring war on China suddenly spread in the market. Although it was difficult to determine whether the news was good or bad, sellers became more eager, and Xinyuan continued to sell relentlessly, causing the price to fall back below 600 yuan to a low of 6,590 yuan. However, spot buyers closed out their positions at noon, raising the closing price to 6,612 yuan, down 24 yuan from the previous day, with a fluctuation of 65 yuan in the morning. The selling price of the main brand of spot gold was more than 60 yuan higher than the forward price of refined gold, and the buying price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. There was little activity in current gold bidding.

Gold Ornaments Also Down 10 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael was initially listed by Datonghang and Xintonghang at 690 yuan, but around 11 o'clock it was lowered by 10 yuan to 680 yuan, with the buying price reduced by 30 yuan.

### Securities Bond Market Battles Between Bulls and Bears - Market Prices Fluctuate Sharply

The unofficial market for public bonds was highly competitive yesterday, with both bulls and bears actively covering shorts and establishing new positions. Companies such as Xie Kang, Changchun, and Shenchang all had volumes of hundreds of thousands. The market price of Class C bonds suddenly rose to 5.40 yuan, almost a yuan better than the previous day. Unexpectedly, Delonghao and Yundahao, who had bought the previous day, suddenly started selling again, causing the market price to fall back by about a yuan. Then, Hukehhao, Yizhong, and Renchang bought in, causing the price to rebound by 5 or 6 cents. However, Yuxing, Xinfu, Tongkang, Lianheng, Hengkang, and general retail investors sold off, causing the market price to fall back by another 1 or 2 cents. The intense competition between bulls and bears caused the market price to fluctuate wildly, rising and falling sharply. The trend is gradually changing, and the future should gradually improve. Yesterday was the last day for consecutive draws for Class A bonds. Opinions differed on whether the draws would be consecutive or not. It is expected that Class A bonds will stand out after the draw is completed. Class E bonds are the cheapest and are gradually attracting attention. As a result, Class B and D bonds fell slightly, while the rest rebounded by 1.5 to 6.5 cents. The transaction volume was about 3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

| Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Stock trading: 500 shares of Hanyang Ironworks were traded at a price of 4.75 yuan.

Yarn and Fabric Miscellaneous Brand Yarn Prices Decline Daily Double Horse Still Struggling

The yarn market is flat and lacks momentum. This is due to sluggish actual transactions and difficulties in transportation, so some bullish sentiment has turned bearish, gradually unloading large positions. However, securities firms are mostly holding on, and Double Horse shares are closed, not loosening. As a result, the prices of miscellaneous brand yarns are declining daily due to the cessation of sales, but the market price of Double Horse is still rising independently. The highest price for 20s Double Horse was 1,496 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,481 yuan.

Double Horse opened in the morning with a soft appearance due to scattered sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price was 1,486 yuan. As soon as this price opened, the market became even more stagnant. Although the bulls on the trading floor were supportive, the large number of buyers were not aggressive, rising slightly to 1,496 yuan. Then, it was heard that the transaction of real yarn was as light as usual, with very little development. At the same time, the prices of Tiannv, Jincheng, and other yarns declined, and there were few buyers, so the market price turned down to 1,481 yuan. However, the bullish sentiment was very strong, and it rebounded again to between 1,485 yuan, standing for one and a half hours. The intense competition between the bulls and bears can be imagined. The final closing price was 1,488 yuan. The amount of purchases by various syndicates is listed on the left:

Hong Kong Ninety Syndicate 6,450

Statistics 6,535

### Cotton Falls Again

The spot cotton situation continues to decline. This is because yarn is not performing well, sales are stagnant, and the price of miscellaneous brand yarn is even cheaper, so factory purchasing sentiment has turned sluggish. At the same time, foreign exchange rates are rising, and cotton prices are trending downward.

In the New York cotton market, everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the market is flat and stagnant. As a result, the closing price was 1-2 points lower than the previous day.

Indian cotton is also weak, still falling due to bullish closures, falling more than 2 rupees yesterday along with forecasts.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, everyone's purchase of raw cotton has not been very enthusiastic recently. Whether it is factories or fellow traders, they all seem to be waiting for opportunities and are unwilling to make more purchases at the moment. As a result, the market has become calm, and large transactions are even rarer. Perhaps the prosperous period will be temporarily separated for a few days.

### Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Sales Stagnant - Selling Prices Fell More Than They Rose

The factory cloth market weakened yesterday due to stagnant actual sales in the passenger market and the daily depreciation of yarn prices. Sentiment was downstream, sales were chaotic, and transactions were scarce. Some coarse and fine twills of white goods fell by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Fugui fine cloth opened in the morning at 44.75 yuan, and fell to 44.25 yuan in the afternoon. Bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 5 cents per piece. The street traded more than 300 pieces of various cloths, the Zhelu Yongtai Syndicate bought more than 100 pieces of fine cloth and bleached cloth, the Min Syndicate bought more than 100 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill and bleached cloth, and the Yuegang Syndicate's new transactions were very idle.

Yesterday, the Dong cloth market fell due to the decline in the yarn market. Sentiment continued to soften, and fine white cloth fell by 5 cents per piece. 12-pound Longtou was now priced at 49.65 yuan at noon. The exchange's current month futures were 50.03 yuan. Although the transaction of colored goods, the Four Gentlemen, and serge was not much, the bottom of the goods turned tight and still sold for 1.35 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains Soybean Cake Speculation Momentum is Huge

Yesterday's soybean cake market continued to decline due to the soft trend of the previous day. After the mainland Syndicate and the Hong Kong Syndicate slightly had a way to go for the current cakes, the general kick-the-ball operators were creating wind and waves, and the buying sound was higher than everything else. The market atmosphere in the market suddenly showed a tense situation, but as a result, there were more demands than supplies, and the market had no characteristics. It only rebounded by 4 or 5 cents. According to statistics, one truck of Yuanlong cake was traded at a price of 15.30 yuan, and another truck was traded in the lower part of February (the price is detailed in the market price column). Five trucks were traded in the first half of March, and one truck was traded in the second half of March. Fifteen trucks of Feizi cake were traded in the second half of February. One thousand pieces of Lizhi cake were traded in the first half of February, and two thousand pieces were traded in the second half of February. Five hundred pieces of Xingji current cake were traded, one thousand pieces were traded in the second half of February, more than ten thousand pieces were traded in the first half of March, and more than ten thousand pieces were traded in the second half of March.

### Sugar Market Sugar Prices Rise and Fall

Yesterday's sugar market fluctuated. The Association's price for spot goods of 24 crude white foreign stacks was 80.05 yuan, 80.08 yuan to 81.00 yuan for the 10th of this month, and then returned to 80.09 yuan, small triangle, 81.16 yuan to 81.19 yuan for the 25th of this month, up 2 cents, and 81.16 yuan to 82.23 yuan for the 1st of next month, up 1 cent. In the afternoon, spot goods were 81.14 yuan, Taikoo Che Bai B Mark was 80.08 yuan to 81.15 yuan, up 5 cents, HX Mark spot goods were 78.13 yuan, and 79.12 yuan for the 25th of this month.

### Coal White Coal Dust New Goods Arrive

Hongji white coal dust, the raw material for coal balls, was once in short supply, leading to rumors of making balls from smoke dust. After being proven inaccurate, yesterday a certain company's (Melar) ship loaded 6,500 tons of new goods, including 1,200 tons of lump coal and 5,300 tons of coal dust. It is being unloaded and stocked, so the inventory in this city is full, and there is no shortage of raw materials for coal balls.

### This Morning's International Cup Football Showdown: China vs. Portugal, 10:30 AM at Recreation Ground for Quarterfinals; France Plays Judea This Afternoon

This year's International Cup football tournament, contested by seven strong teams, saw the Chinese team achieve a victorious start last week, defeating England 1-0. Judea won against Russia, and Portugal eliminated the World Team. Today marks the quarterfinals, with China facing Portugal, and Judea playing France, who had a bye last week. The China-Portugal match will kick off at 10:30 AM at the Recreation Ground on Avenue Albert, refereed by Canal. The Chinese lineup has already been announced, but Li Ning will be absent due to an injury sustained during practice. Zhuang Youren will be reassigned to left back, with Zhang Lingen, previously a reserve, filling Zhuang's position. Examining the overall team composition, it appears quite organized. Defensively, in addition to Qin Biguo as goalkeeper, the two iron gates of Zhang and Zhuang are present. The center-back line may be slightly weakened due to the absence of Liang Shutang and Han Longhai. The forwards have been bolstered by the return of Li Yichen from Shanghai, supported by the agile Sun Tuitui, and led by center forward Dai. Jia Youliang and Wan Jin on the left and right wings provide sharp attacks, capable of intimidating the enemy. The Portuguese team also boasts a strong lineup, with the defenders Victor and Mashan'er, center back Costa, right winger Favansiao, all seasoned veterans and dangerous figures. Oliveira and V. Su Ruo have been selected for the Shanghai Western United Team, their skills improving daily, making their strength formidable. Today's meeting of these two teams is akin to a final. In the last tournament's final, China had their championship title snatched away by a dubious penalty kick. This year, with old scores to settle, the Chinese team will undoubtedly fight tooth and nail to defeat the strong opponents and avenge last year's humiliation. Furthermore, the Chinese team has announced that Zhang Lingen was not notified in time. He is requested to gather at 9:30 AM this morning at the Donghua Association on Route Lafayette after seeing this notice. The other quarterfinal match of the International Cup, Judea vs. France, will be held at 2:30 PM at the Racecourse. In addition, there are two league matches: Group B Yosheng vs. Russian Overseas Chinese, and Group C Huamao vs. Witoring. Today's schedule is as follows: China - Portugal (National) 10:00 AM Recreation Ground; Judea - France (National) 2:30 PM Racecourse; Yosheng - Russian Overseas Chinese Association (Group B) 3:00 AM Aurora University.

### Confirm the Plan

— Ying Dai

— Written at the Start of the School Term —

Time passes quickly. In the blink of an eye, the two-week winter vacation has mercilessly ended, and since last week, every child has returned to their normal school life. At the beginning of this school term, I want to remind the children of one thing: confirm your study plan for the next six months. Every child should not overlook this and should put it into practice.

As the saying goes: "A year's plan starts in spring, and a day's plan starts in the morning." We can say that a semester's study plan starts at the beginning of the school term. Nothing in the world will succeed without a plan, and the same is true for our studies. Therefore, at the beginning of this school term, the most important thing is to confirm your plan. The sages tell us that "preparation ensures success, lack of preparation ensures failure." The so-called "preparation" means determining the plan in advance and then doing things according to the plan. Then, no matter how difficult things are, they can be done successfully. Conversely, if you do something without a plan beforehand, there will be no hope of success.

Understanding this point, you can see that if we want to make considerable progress in our studies in the next six months, we must first confirm a study plan. For subjects that were relatively poor in the past, we should double our efforts this semester. For those that are relatively good, we must not be complacent and neglect them. Set aside a few hours each day for extracurricular work. When to write? When to read? What books to read outside of class? How many books to read each month? Which books to read? What articles to write? When to write a diary? Everything must be planned and listed on a study plan.

However, finally, there is one more particularly important point, which is to be able to actually implement it. Once the study plan is confirmed, you must read and write every day, every month, according to the items listed on the table. Otherwise, if the plan is determined at the beginning of the school term, but not followed after the start of school, it is exactly the same as having no plan, and it will not be effective. Therefore, once our plan is confirmed, we should proceed according to the plan in everything, and then there will be considerable progress in the coming semester.

He was inspired by a region, a feeling of grief and indignation. He worked hard to encourage himself, secretly uniting the people of the country, plotting to launch a revolutionary movement to restore Siam's national glory. As a result, after three decisive hard battles, Siam was revived in the hands of Zheng Zhao. After losing the land was recovered and national humiliation was wiped out, how grateful should those Siamese people be to Zheng Zhao? Zheng Zhao became the first king of Siam under the support of the people. After this, he also revived until he conquered the entire Burma with the Qing Dynasty's coalition forces.

Zheng Zhao had no sons, so he adopted a Siamese local named Hua Ce Geli as his adopted son, and later married his daughter to him. After Zheng Zhao's death, Hua Ce Geli inherited the throne. As these times continued, it became present day Siam. Our ancestors did that to become Siam's benefactor, but Siam treats us overseas Chinese with such abuse! What is the reason for this? Children, please study it carefully.

### The Result of Eating Too Much During the New Year

— Jin Zhen

After spending a lunar New Year, A-Liang's stomach was full of greasy things, like braised pork, cured meat, etc. These were not easily digested for a while, so they accumulated in his stomach and intestines, causing his appetite to decrease. His rice intake decreased from two full bowls to the point where he couldn't even finish one bowl, and his bowel movements were also abnormal. He told his mother about all of this during mealtime.

"This is because you ate too much greasy food and other sweets and snacks! From now on, you must eat less and eat more vegetables, and you'll be fine soon," his mother muttered to him.

"What's the reason for this?" he asked his father at the table more carefully.

"When greasy meat is eaten, it takes a relatively long time to digest. If you eat too much, the stomach and intestines don't have time to digest it all at once, so it accumulates, causing a decrease in appetite. Food is a very important thing, as it can help with growth, maintain health, and provide the power for activity, but this refers to normal food. If you eat too much, it will not only be useless but also cause stomach problems. Therefore, everyone should eat according to their own stomach. Eat to moderation, and don't eat only one or two kinds of food. Some people like to eat meat but don't eat vegetables; others like to eat vegetables but don't eat much meat. This is also not right. You must know that everyone should adapt to the environment, follow habits, and freely choose food, so that the nutrition will not be lacking. Therefore, you should pay attention to the food that must provide the necessary amount of nutrients, protein, minerals, and various vitamins. In other words, no matter vegetables or meat, don't be picky, and eat everything that is necessary. This is because vegetables are rich in minerals, and meat contains more protein and other vitamins. The purpose of our food is not to eat how delicious they are, but to absorb the nutrients in them that can sustain life, and the deliciousness is just to cause us to want to eat them. Your indigestion in the past few days is of course the result of eating too much, so you should eat less for now and let your stomach get hungry, because being hungry is a good thing. You should never eat desperately when your stomach is hungry. From now on, when you eat, you should pay attention to trying every dish on the table. In addition to three meals a day, all other snacks should be quit, and you will never have this kind of indigestion again."

the method to keep the water from flowing away, so they build dams. Their teeth are very powerful. They bite a small tree all around the base, making it thinner and thinner until the tree falls over on its own. Then they bite off all the branches and drag them into the river, submerging them and burying them in the mud at the bottom of the river to secure them. They weave the bitten-off branches into a dam, piling mud and stones on top. Their tools are their mouths and two front feet. Because there are many workers and they are earnest, they soon achieve remarkable results. Then, relying on the sand and debris flowing in the river, they accumulate it, making it thicker and thicker, and the thicker it is, the stronger it becomes. If they are willing to open a gap in the dam to allow the river water to flow smoothly, that would be good. Otherwise, when the river water is blocked by the dam, it will flood both sides of the river, often causing disasters and washing away houses and fields. Therefore, beavers are actually harmful animals.

### The Master of the Lolo Restoration

— Cheng Ming

At this time of extreme tension in the Vietnamese situation, we see news about Thailand on the newspaper from time to time, this is not within the scope of this article, let's not talk about it for now, Thailand is Siam; let's go back to the history of the restoration of Siam, briefly described as follows:

Siam was once destroyed, but it was the Chinese Zheng Zhao who cleaned up the mess for the destroyed Siam and rebuilt the glorious history.

During the Qianlong era, there was a person named Zheng Zhao from Chenghai County, Chaozhou, Guangdong, who drifted with his father to Siam at a very young age. They lived there for decades, and this Zheng Zhao became the prime minister of Siam.

Siam and Burma are two countries with age-old feuds. During the Qianlong reign, the Burmese king led his troops to attack Siam, defeating the Siamese soldiers and occupying all the land. They also annihilated all the surviving members of the previous king's family. At that time, Zheng Zhao was already over fifty years old. He had long since resigned from his official position and lived in seclusion in a very remote place in southern Siam. After the country was in turmoil, although he was old, his ambition was not diminished. Watching the beautiful mountains and rivers become different countries,

### Children's Words

— San San

Child A: Where were you born?

Child B: I was born in the hospital.

Child A: Ah, what sickness did you have?

Teacher: Everyone must remember to walk on the left side.

Student: Teacher, that's not right. Those coming walk on the left, and those going also walk on the left. Wouldn't everyone bump into each other?

Teacher: Why are you late again? It's like this every day.

Student: I walk slowly!

Teacher: Why don't you walk faster?

Student: Many of the road signs on the road told me to do so.

Teacher: How so? What road signs did you see?

Student: "School Ahead, Walk Slowly!"

### Beavers with Architectural Skills

— Fang Heng

Children may not be very familiar with the name "beaver." Yes, their homes are very far from us, in North America! So I must first introduce their appearance and then talk about how they build houses and dams.

Because they love to bite things, like rats and rabbits, animal researchers classify them as rodents. The large ones are two feet long, and the head is a bit like a rat. The strangest things are the tail and hind feet. The creator gave them a flat, scaly tail like a small oar and webbed hind feet for easy swimming. When swimming, the hind feet paddle, and the tail becomes a rudder. Not only can it be used as a rudder, but it can also be used as a chair. When eating or biting trees, they sit on this chair. They like water,

So their homes are always in the middle of the willow trees by the water's edge. They dig two holes in the ground, leading straight to the bottom of the river, like a tunnel. This is the entrance and exit, and they also use this tunnel to go to the bottom of the river to find their food.

They build houses right above the underground holes, building them very well, like a small fortress. The materials are branches, mud, and small stones. They collect these materials and use their innate architectural genius to build them quite solidly. The interior is also very elegant, with carpets and mattresses woven from thin branches and tender leaves. Beavers enjoy their family happiness here.

Beavers love water most, but in winter, the river will be shallow and dry, so they think of

### The Future of the Old Female Role

— Gu Mei

In Yuan dramas, old female roles were sometimes played by painted-face characters. In Kunqu opera, it's a clown's job. Peking opera often has elderly male actors portraying them. In the north, Xie Baoting and Zhou Changshan both played elderly roles while also being elderly characters. The only true old female role specialist was Gong Yunfu. After Gong, there was Wolun Jushi, Chen Wenqi, Wen Rongshou, and Li Duokui. In addition, Zhu Guifen (pictured), Wang Xiaonong, Liu Hongsheng, and Wang Fengqing could all perform old female roles. In the south, in the past 20 years, besides Fu Xianfang, Zhao Junyu, Mao Yunke, and Lü Yueqiao could all play old female roles. Now, the older generation has passed away one after another. The younger generation either practices elderly male roles or learns flowered shirts. Some have voices but not appearances, singing for painted face roles and little flowered face roles. The old female role has become a neglected art. In the past decade, there's only been one Li Duokui in the north who still has some old female role flavor, but she can only sing and not act. Although Wen Liangchen was good at acting, he had no voice. After Li Duokui and his qin player Lu Wu broke up a few years ago, her tone was not as good as before (Lu was originally Gong Yunfu's qin player). Wen Liangchen also died last year. Taking the best of the short, there's only Sun Futing. Sun is not as good at acting as Wen Liangchen, nor can she sing as well as Li Duokui. Now, there's a Ma Lüyun, who once partnered with Jin Shaoshan to sing "Broken Empress Dowager." Besides her voice, her mouth, body, and tone still need to be greatly studied. Zhang Jufang, He Shengqing, and Huang Jin's Zhang Shengyu and Li Jinquan, who have sung in the new era, are all inferior.

The south doesn't produce old female roles, but it does produce male martial roles who play old female roles. Like He Yueshan, Yang Ruiting, and Ying Baolian. There are a few supporting old female roles, such as He Runchu and Liu Zhenting. Therefore, Zhang Shaoquan, a female elderly male role who changed careers, has become the Li Duokui of the south. Now, her daughter is debuting (that is, the movie star Li Lihua), but with a weak body, Zhang Shaoquan is not as good as she was three years ago, when she could sing and act to support half the country south of the Yangtze River. If you want to hear old female roles performed alone in the south, it will only happen with Yang Ruiting's cross-dressing.

Old female roles in the north now follow the Gong Yunfu style. In the early years, the south mostly followed Wang Guifen. When Guifen was in Shanghai, she liked to sing old female roles, so Yang Ruiting, Wu Guifen, and Sun Guifen mostly followed the Wang style in their singing. Zhao Junyu also hummed a few Wang tunes in private. Lü Yueqiao and Mao Yunke had more Shen components. Now, many of those who cross-dress as elderly roles are old, and those who learn old female roles are dead. Apart from a few who don't have the right tone or appearance but can be considered old female roles, the big troupes are all clowns and elderly male actors playing the roles. In the north, there's Ma Fulu in Ma Lianliang's troupe and Li Baokui in Li Shaochun's troupe. In the south, there's Li Changshan at the Carlton and Chen Jufang at Huangjin. Zhang Guifang at the Grand Stage is also very good. In the near future, the old female role profession will undoubtedly be eliminated and will return to the old practice of being played by elderly male actors and clowns. Shou Wu

### Scattered Notes from the Entertainment World

— Shou Wu

Since "Frontier Storm" is set in the frontier, the location shooting team has been there once. Now the costumes and props for the film purchased from the frontier have arrived in Chongqing. The interior scenes will be shot immediately. At that time, the studio will be a scene of frontier scenery.

It is said that Minhua's second big film, "Children of the World," will only begin filming after the complete scripts in Chinese, German, and English have been finished. There are four or five important roles in the film. Zhang Yi and Lan Lan have been decided, and the remaining roles will be filled with new talents as much as possible.

It is said that the Hong Kong Xinsheng Company, under the leadership of Cai Chusheng, Situ Huimin, and Tan Youliu, has organized reading groups, etc. According to Cai, this is to "make up for congenital deficiencies." There are also weekly seminars, which carpenters, workers, and tea attendants all attend. Since its inception, it has been very beneficial.

It is said that Cao Wan's "Transformation" is about various things in the rear hospital for wounded soldiers. Therefore, the Shanghai audience during the "isolated island" period will probably not have the fortune to see the play on stage.

Gu Zhengqiu, a student at the Shanghai Drama School, is very small, but when she dresses up, she looks like a female elderly role. This person is very photogenic, very much like Yuan Meiyun in her early days as a female actor. If you don't believe it, there's a picture as proof.

### Cao Yu's New Work, "Peking Man," Finished and Sent to Shanghai

When Cao Yu was in Shanghai, he promised the Shanghai Drama Society to write a script. The play was named "Peking Man," but after writing one act, he stopped writing and completed the two plays "Transformation" and "Thinking." Except that "Thinking" has been performed by the Shanghai Drama Society, "Transformation" cannot be performed due to environmental reasons. It is heard that the play "Peking Man" has been completed and will be sent to Shanghai soon. The Shanghai Drama Society will of course rehearse it immediately. As for Cao Yu's other work "Competing for Strength," the Drama Society will perform it after "Lying World."

The play "Thunderstorm" caused a sensation and attracted countless audiences after its first performance, winning praise from all walks of life. As a result, the reputation of the China Travel Drama Troupe has also become increasingly popular. It has been deeply supported by the general audience until now. Recently, China Travel has rehearsed "Thunderstorm" again, so each theater troupe has also risen and rehearsed "Thunderstorm," which shows the value of "Thunderstorm." However, after this play has been performed for so long, a question has always floated in my mind: the age issue of the characters in the play.

The ages of each person listed in the script:

Zhou Puyuan - 55 years old

Zhou Fanyi - 35 years old

Zhou Ping - 28 years old

Zhou Chong - 17 years old

Lu Gui - 48 years old

Lu Shiping - 47 years old

### The Age Problem in "Thunderstorm"

— Zhang Huiyu

Lu Dahai - 27 years old

Lu Sifeng - 18 years old

The above ages are all 30 years later. Then, let's calculate their ages 30 years ago according to the table. Zhou Puyuan should be 25 years old, and Lu Shiping should be 17 years old. Then how old should Zhou Ping and Lu Dahai be? This is the age problem that I suspect.

Zhou Puyuan and Lu Shiping separated for 30 years, starting from when Shiping ran away with the newborn Lu Dahai. At this time, Zhou Ping and Lu Dahai had already been born, but Zhou Ping was one year older than Lu Dahai. According to this calculation, Zhou Ping should be at least 31 years old, and Dahai should be at least 20 years old. The ages in the character table are 28 years old for Zhou Ping and 27 years old for Lu Dahai. This is a truly puzzling question. Although the problem is not important, it will become a joke if you don't pay attention to it.

(Editor's Note: The age problem of the characters in the play "Thunderstorm" has been discussed before. This is just like the heroine in "A Year's Time" giving birth to a child after 12 months of pregnancy. It's just an occasional oversight by the author. The theater troupes may wish to correct the age when performing in the future.)
