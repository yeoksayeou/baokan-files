### British Ships Concentrate in the North Atlantic: US Public Opinion Favors Escort; President Roosevelt to Deliver Important Speech; Actions to Aid Democratic Nations and Protect Merchant Ships to Be Kept Secret

Washington – Government sources recently hinted that Britain has concentrated its naval power in the North Atlantic. This situation is sufficient to ensure the relative safety of US-bound cargo ships. Knowledgeable sources believe that although the situation in the North Atlantic is gradually improving, Britain is not satisfied with maritime safety alone. Some people have questioned Senator Barkley's claim that US goods are being safely delivered to Britain. President Westhover stated yesterday that he did not believe Barkley had made such a statement. (United Press International, 21st)

New York – According to a recent Gallup public opinion poll, the percentage of the American public favoring US escort of military supplies to Britain has increased by 11%. The organization also declared that, according to research, the majority of American voters would rather go to war than see Britain defeated. According to the survey, 52% of Americans polled favored escort, compared to 41% a month earlier. (Associated Press, 21st)

Tallahassee – The Florida State Legislature unanimously passed a resolution yesterday requesting the US Congress to provide naval escorts for Britain and to provide aid to Britain to the fullest extent possible. The body, by a vote of 69 to 0, specifically requested that Congress send naval escorts to transport munitions and supplies to Britain. (United Press International, 21st)

London – News correspondents stationed in Washington predict that President Roosevelt will deliver an important speech in the shortest possible time, possibly within a week. Meanwhile, German newspapers are launching a massive attack on President Roosevelt's recent remarks. One newspaper condemned President Roosevelt as being brainless and the biggest liar in the world. (Reuters, 21st)

Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday received journalists and stated that he may not be sending any special messages to Congress in the near future. The hundred or so reporters present were disappointed to hear this, as they had gathered at the White House office, fully expecting to hear the President's decision on major policies. (Reuters, 21st)

Washington – It was learned yesterday that Britain expects the US to eventually join the war. Britain's victory plan is based on this assumption. US officials are convinced that British leaders may no longer believe that Britain can make military decisions without US participation. The British government is now adopting a strategy of protracted war, waiting for the US to be fully prepared and join the fighting. It is widely believed that the American people once thought that Britain could not win without US participation, so the US will inevitably join the war with all its strength. It is generally pointed out that recent US actions have not disappointed Britain. Not only that, it is believed that the recent statements issued by Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Secretary of the Interior Ickes have all increased Britain's confidence. (International News Service, 21st)

Washington – The US Maritime Commission yesterday requested newspapers, radio stations, news agencies, and other public information organizations to voluntarily review news about the actions of US merchant ships aiding democratic nations. Maritime Commission Chairman Rear Admiral Land listed the following items as information that should not be published: (1) Actual or intended actions of any ships aiding Britain and other democratic nations. This applies particularly to ships sailing to rivers, seas, China, and Rangoon. This includes grain ships. (2) The nature of the ships used to aid democratic nations and the names of their routes. (3) The arrival and departure of these ships. (4) The goods carried by these ships. Land pointed out that the press had cooperated with the US Navy Department regarding the movement of US warships and personnel. He also said that the press had voluntarily stopped publishing the movements of British warships. He further stated, "The actions of US merchant ships aiding democratic nations are equally important. News about these actions should also not be disclosed." (Associated Press, 21st)

Washington – The House of Representatives yesterday passed a bill authorizing the Maritime Commission to regulate shipping prices, cargo, and voyages for national defense purposes. The bill has been sent to the Senate. (Reuters, 21st)

Washington – The US Shipping Commission officially announced today that President Roosevelt's plan to collect two million tons of shipping to aid Britain and supplement the US Navy has now acquired 1.5 million tons of shipping, of which 460,000 tons are foreign ships that have been stranded in US ports due to the war. It is widely believed that President Roosevelt will soon sign a bill to take over these ships. Regarding the fate of the world's largest passenger ship, the French liner "Normandie" (86,000 tons), it is reported that experts from the US Shipping Commission are currently discussing converting it into a convoy transport ship or an aircraft carrier. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

### Daily Newspaper Commentary: US Policy Believed to be Leading to War

Tokyo – The Yomiuri Shimbun published an editorial this morning stating that President Roosevelt's policy is aimed at getting public support for US participation in the war. The direction of US public sentiment in the next few days will determine the fate of the US. The newspaper believes that the US President and his war cabinet may advocate occupying French territories in the western Atlantic and Dakar in North Africa. This would be tantamount to entering the war without a declaration of war. The US President's recent silence on the issue of armed escort suggests that he also knows that this move will lead to war. However, the US President is prepared to take this step. The only obstacle now is strong public opinion. Public opinion is now divided into two factions: one opposes this move, and the other is hesitant. President's Roosevelt's fireside chat on the 27th of this month will reveal the extent to which the government believes it has succeeded in stirring up the fervor for war. (Reuters, 21st)

### US Relief Funding for One Year Estimated at Over $800 Million

Washington – President Roosevelt has asked Congress to approve $8,886,000,000 in relief funding for the year beginning July 1. This amount is $109,000,000 less than the estimated amount in the current budget. (Reuters, 21st)

### US President Announces Establishment of Office of Civilian Defense and Urges Congress to Expedite Legislation to Facilitate the Laying of Oil Pipelines

Washington – From President Roosevelt's domestic defense program yesterday, it is clear that he intends to give every American man, woman, and child the opportunity to help defend the country. The President announced the establishment of the Office of Civilian Defense yesterday evening, with Mayor La Guardia of New York as its director. This organization is based purely on volunteerism and will be managed by the Office of Emergency Management. La Guardia will arrive in Washington today to begin operations. (United Press International, 21st)

Washington – President Roosevelt announced the establishment of a civil defense organization within the United States at a press conference yesterday, saying that he had issued an executive order establishing the Office of Civil Defense, with Mayor La Guardia of New York as its director. The office is divided into two groups: one is the Civilian Protection Group, which will also include representatives from the Departments of the Navy, Army, and Justice to guide and assist in the development of civil defense plans to ensure adequate protection of life and property in the event of an emergency; the other is the Volunteer Participation Group, which will be composed of representatives from all levels across the country. La Guardia will remain the Mayor of New York, but will serve as Director of the Office of Civilian Defense without pay. (Reuters, 21st)

Washington – President Roosevelt has sent a letter to House Speaker Rayburn, urging Congress to expedite legislation to facilitate the laying of oil pipelines to benefit national defense, saying that the matter is extremely important. The lack of convenient oil transportation now means that oil consumption may need to be limited to essential uses within a few months. The Atlantic coast industry, people and military bases now rely entirely on coastal oil tankers to transport oil. This method is time-consuming and dangerous. (Reuters, 21st)

### Soviet Reserve Soldiers Called Up for Military Exercises

Moscow – The Soviet military newspaper reported that Red Army reserve soldiers have been ordered to enlist and participate in upcoming Soviet military exercises. The reserve soldiers have now joined their original units. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)

### Air Defense Exercise Held in Hawaii with Complete Blackout

Honolulu – Hawaii held its third air raid defense exercise last night. Multiple US heavy bombers flew overhead, and lights across the island were almost uniformly turned off at 9:15 PM. This complete blackout was part of one of the largest military exercises in Hawaii's history. Honolulu and remote rural areas were all uniformly implementing the drill to guard against enemy aircraft bombing. Within minutes after US Army observers reported an air raid alert to headquarters, the lights were completely extinguished, sirens and bells rang out, street lights briefly flashed before going completely dark, and all key military institutions were also completely darkened. 40,000 troops were deployed in completed battlefield fortresses, using searchlights to find enemy aircraft, and anti-aircraft artillery units were prepared to start combat when enemy aircraft appeared. (Associated Press, 21st)

### Japan-Netherlands East Indies Negotiations Ultimately to Fail

Tokyo – An editorial in the Asahi Shimbun this morning speculated on the outcome of the commercial negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies, saying that the success or failure of the negotiations should be known within the next week. It also said that Yoshizawa, the Japanese chief representative, had made great efforts in the negotiations, but feared that they would ultimately fail. However, Japan should still be patient and persevere, because the issue of establishing a co-prosperity sphere in East Asia is fundamentally peaceful. It is hoped that the Netherlands East Indies will also take appropriate steps to adapt to the rapidly changing situation in the world. Iraq and Iran are about to break away from British control, so the oil produced by the Netherlands East Indies is not only particularly valued by Britain, but also by the United States. Japan, of course, must give serious consideration to the future progress of these commercial negotiations. (Reuters, 21st)

### General Minami Jiro Meets with German Ambassador

Editorial

### Overview of the Current International Situation

Just as British forces launched an offensive in Iraq, German paratroopers suddenly attacked Crete, where the exiled Greek government was located. Although most of the first batch of 1,500 German troops were quickly annihilated, a second batch of 3,000 paratroopers continued to land, and were still fighting hard as of this writing. Crete is sparsely populated with inadequate defenses, which favors paratrooper operations. However, unlike in the Netherlands previously, they will not find strong support from fifth columnists there. If the defending forces can calmly respond with sufficient strength and the British air force can quickly gain control of the skies, then perhaps the painful history of last year will not be repeated on the last piece of Greek territory. If this German move is said to be a test run for the invasion of England, it is not worth much attention, because everything about the British Isles is incomparable to Crete. The experience gained by the German army in this operation will be difficult to apply to England in the same way. On the other hand, it is sufficient to show Germany's emphasis on the Eastern Mediterranean, not allowing Britain to drive a wedge into the vicinity of the Greek Peninsula, the Aegean Islands, and even the Dodecanese Islands. At the same time, this is also an attempt to clear its route eastward.

However, the corner of the Near East is not the most advantageous battlefield for Germany to confront Britain. From the current situation, seizing British oil fields and cutting off the Suez Canal are not achievable overnight. The surrender of the last Abyssinian Italian troops has given Britain more convenience in military operations. Unless other major changes occur internationally, such as changes in the attitude of the Soviet Union or Turkey, it is difficult to imagine that Germany can easily achieve any decisive progress. It is the Atlantic and the Far East that have seen more turbulent and delicate situations recently. The content of Darland's negotiations with Germany has not yet been announced, but it can be asserted that the concessions made by Vichy are by no means minor. The convenience gained by German forces in Syria is only the tip of the iceberg. Of course, France has no real strength or possibility of fighting against Britain. Germany also knows that if it forces Vichy too much, it would be tantamount to strangling its life and indirectly boosting the strength of the de Gaulle faction. However, concessions such as the use of some important military bases, as well as giving German forces more operational cooperation and assistance, are undeniable. No matter how Vichy defends itself, it must seek a way to survive in a future of helping Germany defeat Britain. The fate of Pétain, Darland, and their ilk was actually destined from the moment of Compiègne. Both Britain and the United States have been greatly agitated by this and their relationship with the Vichy government is hanging by a thread, but it seems that they have not yet determined their response in practical actions. The Syrian issue has already caused Britain considerable trouble in the Near East. If new changes occur in the Western Mediterranean, and even in West Africa in North Africa, not only will Britain's maritime power in the Mediterranean be in danger, but the storms in the Atlantic will also become more treacherous, and will threaten the security of American countries. Admiral Leahy and the French food aid have not overcome the coercion and temptation of the Nazis. From now on, there is no other way but to adopt a firm and resolute strategy to deal with the situation. At the same time, this is also the approaching maturity of the US's opportunity to enter the war.

Amidst this turmoil, only the situation in the Far East seems to be unaffected by the progress of the European war, which is strangely intriguing. The Soviet-Japanese pact did not receive a better response than the Tripartite Pact. The practical value of the Tripartite Pact's provisions for dealing with other countries participating in the European war cannot be accurately assessed by anyone. At the same time, the war against China is expanding. Suddenly, a trial balloon was found suggesting that the United States mediate the Sino-Japanese war. Even if Tokyo denies this, it seems not absolutely inconceivable when compared with the recent statement of "striving to resolve the China incident diplomatically." Naturally, the influence of the current European war on the United States is sufficient to create an illusion that the US's approaching the brink of war will reduce its concern for the Far East. If it is possible to take this opportunity to allay American suspicions, it may be possible to exchange it for some concessions from the United States. This is the main reason for the various gestures that have been made recently. As for the tough tone on the other hand, it may be a gesture to coordinate with this, or it may fundamentally represent the views of the opponents. The variety and divergence of opinions and arguments these days are sufficient to prove that not only will they not receive any effective response externally, but they also lack a unified point of view and confidence internally.

Now is the eve of the international situation entering another new stage. Most of the future development of the situation will be dominated by the various factors that are currently in progress. Major changes occurred in the international community at this time last year, but everything now may be of more decisive significance than the various events of last year.

### 18th Group Army Should Go to Aid Zhongtiaoshan; The Ta Kung Pao Yesterday Called for in its Editorial

Chongqing – The Ta Kung Pao commented on the importance of the situation in Southern Shanxi and made an appeal in its editorial today, saying that Shanxi is a northern plateau, and by controlling Shanxi, the northern provinces can be controlled. The Zhongtiao Mountains are the key to Shanxi, and by having the Zhongtiao Mountains, Shanxi cannot be lost. The Zhongtiao Mountains have been the most important strategic base in the north for our army in the past three or four years. This time, the Japanese army has concentrated the strength of eight divisions to fight for it, and the Chinese army should attach great importance to it. So far, the main reason why the Japanese have been able to gain some advantages in the area is that the Chinese army has failed to coordinate and be consistent. Most of the reports from the Japanese side are fabrications and cannot be believed. However, the fact remains that the Southern Shanxi campaign has been going on for half a month, the Chinese army is fighting hard, the whole country is concerned, and the 18th Group Army is concentrated in northern Shanxi and has not yet cooperated with friendly forces. We hereby sincerely appeal that all national troops in Shanxi must coordinate, be consistent, and fight together. We want the north, so we cannot give up Shanxi. We want Shanxi, so we cannot give up the Zhongtiao Mountains. Therefore, the Battle of Southern Shanxi must be fought with all our strength to ensure its victory. The 18th Group Army should immediately go to aid Zhongtiaoshan. In this way, all Japanese rumors will disappear, and loyalty and courage will be greatly demonstrated. (Dispatch on the 21st)

### A Japanese Plane Raiding Chengdu Shot Down by Chinese Forces, Crashed in Baiyangchang, Huayang County, Entire Plane Destroyed by Fire, Pilot Killed

Chengdu: More than sixty aircraft belonging to the Japanese 12th and 13th Naval Air Groups invaded Sichuan Province in batches around 8:00 AM on the 20th, carrying out wanton destruction. Apart from bomber squadrons dropping bombs on Liangshan and Yibin in separate waves, twenty-one fighter planes in the vanguard advanced towards Chengdu in two batches. At 11:10 AM, they intruded into the city airspace and dispersed, circling over the suburbs. At 11:20 AM, twelve Japanese planes, in a single file formation, flew low from the south of the city towards the southern suburbs. A Boeing 767, No. 767, was hit by machine gun fire from the Chinese Air Force guard unit and immediately crashed in Baiyangchang, part of Huayang County. The entire plane was destroyed by fire, and the pilot was burned to death. The remaining Japanese planes attacked eastward in waves. Afterwards, this reporter rushed to Baiyangchang for inspection and saw that the Japanese plane had sunk five or six feet into the ground. The fuselage and wings were mostly destroyed due to the explosion of the fuel tank after being hit. The tail of the plane remained intact, with the sun emblem still visible. Inside the plane were a pistol, a parachute, two maps, and a flight suit, bearing the inscription "12th Air Group, Kimura," etc. There was also a seal with the inscription "Kimura," presumably belonging to Kimura of the Japanese 12th Naval Air Group. It is understood that the aircraft was manufactured by Mitsubishi and had a flight endurance of up to seven hours. The plane was also equipped with twelve machine guns and cannons and was the latest elite aircraft used by the Japanese Naval Air Force. (Dispatch on the 20th)

### Chen Jiageng's Statement: Supporting the Government

Singapore: Overseas Chinese leader and current Chairman of the China Relief Fund, Chen Jiageng, issued an article to local reporters last night, repeatedly declaring his intention to uphold the Chongqing government and support national unity in fighting Japan to the end. Chen mentioned a report in the local Japanese newspaper stating that a leader with representative qualifications from Fujian Province had telegraphed an invitation for Chen to return home, saying that he had not received a single word from Fuzhou. This is a typical trick of Japanese propagandists to sow discord among overseas Chinese groups and cause friction. It should be known that overseas Chinese have been continuously remitting huge sums of money to the central government to aid in war expenses. This action has already proven the will of the overseas Chinese. Last autumn, when he toured Fujian Province, he did witness poor administration and repeatedly requested the central government to find ways to reform the situation. He believed that if improvements were not made, not only would the people suffer, but Japan would be given an opportunity. His request to eliminate obstacles in the war of resistance and national reconstruction is the responsibility of every citizen towards the motherland. The Japanese, knowing that the overseas Chinese firmly support the government's policies, are carrying out malicious propaganda in an attempt to undermine and divide overseas Chinese unity.

### US Member of the Stabilization Fund to Arrive in China Next Week

### Japanese Planes in Xufu Shot at China National Aviation Corporation Plane

Hong Kong: Reliable sources here claim that yesterday a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) passenger plane was forced to land by Japanese warplanes near Shufu (transliteration) on the Yangtze River, west of Chongqing. The Japanese planes then fired machine guns at the CNAC plane. Among those on board were three Americans, one of whom was the pilot, Hooters, and the other two were the well-known missionary Dr. White and his wife. Fortunately, none were injured. The plane was flying from Chongqing to Chengdu, and Dr. White was going to Chengdu to supervise the university hospital, while his wife was to serve as head nurse. The couple had recently returned to China from the US. Sources here say that Japanese bombers first forced the Douglas DC-2 passenger plane to land, and then fired machine guns at it, damaging the plane's wings. This was not the first time that pilot Hooters had narrowly escaped death. On August 24, 1938, he was piloting a plane that was shot down by Japanese planes near Macau. Fifteen of the nineteen people on board died, while Hooters and four others swam ashore. Hooters had also been stationed in Shanghai for many years and was well-regarded. Dr. White and his wife had also served in China for many years and had recently returned to manage the university hospital, which was funded by the United Christian Universities of China, with its head office in New York City.

It is generally believed that at least 7,000 troops from one German airborne division participated in the operation. Fighting continues today, but according to responsible sources, the situation is under control. Most of the paratroopers jumped from the sky within two hours. The Germans reportedly used dive bombers to cover the landings. The authorities' statement that the situation is under control does not mean that all paratroopers and airborne troops have been eliminated. It is believed that several troop transport planes were shot down before landing on the island. According to reliable sources in London, the enemy bombed Crete all day on May 19. On the morning of Tuesday, the Germans launched another fierce attack, with paratroopers jumping down. Later, they used gliders and troop transport planes. It is rumored that some paratroopers were wearing New Zealand uniforms, but this has been denied by the Germans, who say that this type of uniform is new for paratroopers. The main landing sites were in the west, but some paratroopers also landed in Heraklion. It is said that the German airborne division does not nominally include paratroopers. It is rumored that this division has two infantry regiments and an airborne regiment with an artillery regiment carrying twenty-four 7.4-caliber mountain guns. This regiment has three rifle companies and one machine gun company. The German airborne division continued landing until dusk on Tuesday. It is rumored that several of these troop transport planes were shot down before landing. There is no evidence to support the rumor that the planes were carrying tanks. It is said that the German airborne division does not have transport vehicles, but has been given special orders to requisition vehicles locally upon landing. The Germans used approximately 250 troop transport planes, transporting in three or four waves. The paratroopers landed first, and if successful, they would send a signal, after which the airborne troops would begin landing. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

### The Strategic Importance of Crete

London: People here today are eagerly awaiting news from Crete, as it is believed that German paratroopers must still be landing on the island at night, and it is believed that the fiercest fighting may have already occurred. Military experts believe that if Crete is occupied by the Germans, it will be a serious failure for Britain to maintain control of the eastern Mediterranean. They believe that the island has two most dangerous areas: the Maleme Peninsula in the Suda Bay area on the northwest coast, only fourteen miles long, and the narrow isthmus extending from Almyros Bay to the south. The troops controlling this isthmus can cut off Canea, the seat of the Greek government, and Suda Bay from the rest of Crete. It is not yet known to what extent the German high command is prepared to sacrifice in order to send elite paratroopers to try to occupy the entire island. However, some people suspect that the paratroopers are a suicide squad, trying to disperse British forces and allow the Germans to achieve their attempt to attack Egypt or enter Iraq via Syria. (United Press dispatch on the 21st)

### Berlin Denies Paratrooper Disguise

Berlin: German sources here stated yesterday until 7:30 PM that they could not release any information about the German paratrooper attack on Crete. Well-informed German sources said that the report that German paratroopers were wearing New Zealand military uniforms was untrue. (United Press dispatch on the 21st)

### Following the Old Tactics of Invading the Netherlands, Practice for Attacking England in Advance

London: After German troop transport planes and gliders carrying a suicide squad of 1,500 paratroopers landed on Crete, brutal guerrilla warfare broke out on the island. The German paratroopers were wearing New Zealand convoy uniforms and landed at various key locations. This tactic is the same as the German strategy of occupying Rotterdam, Netherlands, on May 10, 1940, which aimed to first secure several footholds and then wait for reinforcements to arrive. According to Prime Minister Churchill's report in the House of Commons, a large German force is still holding out south of Canea on the Maleme road. However, after fierce and brutal fighting in various locations, the German paratrooper force is gradually being conquered. Last year, both Britain and France warned Germany that if Nazi paratroopers used Allied military uniforms, they would be treated as spies (i.e., executed). Therefore, this war is very brutal. The Allied forces, given the fall of Rotterdam, Netherlands, last year, will fiercely resist this time. Judging from the achievements of Allied Commander Freyberg in the European War, it can be seen that he will never spare the lives of German soldiers wearing British military uniforms. Observers believe that the battle of Crete has three purposes: (1) To occupy an important fortress in the Mediterranean and open the way for the German army to Syria, (2) To contain the British army in order to launch a large-scale offensive elsewhere, (3) To serve as a practical exercise for attacking the British Isles. (United Press dispatch on the 21st)

### British Prime Minister Reports on Recent War Situation in the House of Commons, German Paratroopers Attack Crete Island, British Army Will Have No Difficulty Controlling It

London: British Prime Minister Churchill reported on the war situation in the House of Commons last night, saying that in the past few days, British reconnaissance planes have repeatedly reported seeing various German planes gathered at airfields in southern Greece, in large numbers. British planes attacked them every night, causing heavy damage. But now it is known that the concentration of enemy planes was the prelude to the attack on Crete. The enemy began a fierce attack on the morning of the 20th, and a fierce battle broke out. The British army, including the New Zealand army and the Greek army, responded under the command of General Freyberg. The enemy first bombed and fiercely bombarded Suda Bay and nearby airfields. Then, 1,500 enemy soldiers wearing New Zealand uniforms (the audience shouted angrily) landed in the Ganima-Maleme area by glider and troop transport plane with parachutes. According to military information at 3:00 PM on the 20th, the situation was already under British control. A military hospital between the towns of Canea and Maleme, which had been seized by enemy soldiers, has now been recaptured. It is reported that there are still enemy soldiers who have not been cleared south of the main road in the two towns. The rest should have been resolved. Such is the military development of Crete, which I think the House would like to hear. (The audience cheered)

### Abyssinian War Will End Soon

The British Prime Minister continued to speak about the war in Abyssinia, saying that the victory at Amba Alagi will surely bring the stubborn resistance of the Abyssinian resistance to an end. Although the fighting in the south will have to continue for some time, the most significant battle now appears to be coming to an end. In January of this year, military experts still considered late May or mid-May to be the earliest time for the British army to attack Somaliland. Anyone familiar with the area did not initially expect that the British army, in this desolate region, would have achieved such great success with its courageous actions and extraordinary strategy. The South African army has made great contributions. Now that the fierce fighting in this area is about to end, the South African army will move north to the Mediterranean. (The audience cheered) Two divisions of Indian soldiers have also repeatedly made great contributions, enduring hardship and fighting well, and are admired by the British soldiers.

### No Decisive Victory in the North African Theater

The fighting in the Solon area is also worth mentioning. The fighting there is purely between British and German soldiers. The fighting is fierce, but the scope is not very large. The British mechanized units, supplemented by armored vehicles and artillery, attacked the enemy, capturing the Solon Hellfire Pass and the Capuzzo Fort. On May 17, the British armored units maneuvered to the side and controlled the area. However, the German army launched a desperate counterattack with forty tanks and recaptured Capuzzo. As a result, the British armored units had to withdraw from the positions they had captured. Therefore, the fighting in this area has not been decided. The Germans claim to have captured 100 British soldiers, while the British have captured 500 German prisoners. The enemy's losses of tanks and other equipment, if not greater than the British, must not be light. In the past six weeks, the Germans have often boasted to the neutral countries of the world that they will soon reach Suez and have exaggerated their victories. But we have now maintained their strong offensive force and are engaged in a war of evenly matched forces outside the Egyptian border. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

### Breaking Off Relations with Denmark, Iceland Declares Independence, Parliament Will Appoint a Regent as Soon as Possible to Take Over the Powers Exercised by the Danish King

London: Iceland has decided to break off relations with Denmark. The Icelandic Parliament passed a bill last night authorizing the country to abolish the Act of Union of 1918 between Iceland and Denmark. This act cannot be formally repealed until after the war, but Iceland will appoint a regent as soon as possible to take over the powers previously exercised by the Danish King in Iceland. Since Denmark has been occupied by the Germans, it cannot fulfill its obligations to Iceland in diplomatic affairs, etc., according to this act. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

Copenhagen: Regarding this matter, the Danish government intends to adopt a wait-and-see policy. The government did not discuss the matter last night. Professor Nielsen, vice-president of the Danish-Icelandic Club, expressed regret over Iceland's decision but hoped that Iceland could retain the Nordic language, culture, and relations. (Haitong dispatch on the 21st)

### Eliminating Party Strife, Defending India, Call from the Prime Minister of Punjab

Delhi: The Prime Minister of Punjab, Sir Khizr Hayat Khan Tiwana, issued a statement urging the Indian people to abandon party strife and unite to defend India. Sir Khizr Hayat Khan Tiwana also suggested that the prime ministers of the provinces and the leaders of the parliamentary parties should hold a round table conference to discuss plans to defend India.

### British Reinforcements Continuously Arriving in Iraq to Augment Forces, Germany Actively Arranging Steps to Aid Iraq, Using Syria as a Base

Budapest: Yesterday, it was claimed that strong British reinforcements had arrived in Basra, Iraq, and that more British supplies could soon arrive from Abyssinia. (International News Service dispatch on the 21st)

Cairo: Military sources here say that the city of Fallujah, which was seized by the British army in Iraq, is of great strategic value. Fallujah is the only passage on the Euphrates River between Habbaniyah and Baghdad, allowing only one-way traffic. If this bridge had been destroyed earlier, the British army's route to reinforce Habbaniyah would have been cut off, and the rising Euphrates River would have made it even more difficult for the British army to operate in the area. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

Cairo: Sources here believe that a total of fifty German planes have flown over Syria to date. According to a Columbia Broadcasting System dispatch from Tokyo, the Aleppo airport in Syria has been occupied by German air force ground personnel. The Germans can use a total of more than twenty airports in Syria. Agence France-Presse also reported that some French pilots have flown over the Syrian border and joined General de Gaulle's Free French movement. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

Istanbul: The German official news agency received news from Ankara that Turkish newspapers reported yesterday that German experts had taken over Syrian railways and established large-scale supply centers at important junctions. (United Press dispatch on the 21st)

Cairo: Reliable sources here claim that war materials carried from Syria to Iraq are not transported through Turkey, but are transported by train to Aleppo, transferred to Iraqi trucks, and transported along the highway to Mosul. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

### Free French Forces Enter Syria, Dentz May Be Forced to Step Down

London: According to a Free French news agency dispatch from the Syrian border, it is believed that Free French troops have entered Syria, and the slight sign of a vigorous response from the French army in the area has given the Free French reason to believe that they may be able to obtain support. It is rumored that Dentz, the Vichy high commissioner in Syria, may be forced to step down. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)

London: The French troops stationed in Syria number between 45,000 and 50,000, and most of them are colonial troops. All the weapons are old-fashioned and unusable. There are 300 military aircraft, of which only 30 can participate in combat. (TASS dispatch on the 21st)

### Syria Bolsters Air Defenses, Resolves to Meet Violence with Violence

Vichy: Since British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons a few days ago, relations between Britain and France have entered their final stage. Foreign Secretary Eden's speech can be regarded as a threat to French-mandated territories. The British Air Force immediately bombed the airfields of Syria, killing several French people. General Dentz, the French High Commissioner in Syria, gave a speech the other day, clarifying his position and resolving to meet violence with violence. French Air Minister General Bergeret has gone to Syria, intending to strengthen air defenses in the Near East. Officials here have said that although the French government has repeatedly issued statements, vigorously defending the determination of the French Empire to resist any foreign aggression remains unchanged, but it has never taken any provocative actions. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)

London: Vichy reports that French Air Minister General Bergeret recently arrived in Syria to inspect the defenses against British air raids. However, Agence France-Presse reports that Bergeret arrived in Syria to curb the movement among Syrian soldiers who oppose Vichy's concessions to Germany, because Vichy fears that there may be a strong reaction in Syria and a possible move towards General de Gaulle.

### Henri-Haye Notifies Hull that France is Determined to Defend Overseas Territories; United States Cannot Allow Dakar Port to Fall into German Hands; Believes Germany is Using Syrian Airfields Beyond the Scope of the Agreement

Washington – French Ambassador to the US, Henri-Haye, notified Secretary of State Hull yesterday that France would resist any attempt to seize any part of its empire, "including Martinique Island." Henri-Haye also protested the United States' dispatch of armed guards to monitor French ships docked in US harbors. Henri-Haye stated that he notified Hull that France would not recognize any declarations aimed at seizing French territory and added that the main purpose of his visit to the Secretary of State was to seek clarification of the "turmoil" caused by the United States. This "turmoil" is unreasonable because France has not acted beyond the scope of the Franco-German armistice. Germany and Italy, under the Franco-German armistice, have the right to use French airfields, including bases in Syria. Henri-Haye said that he reminded Hull of France's war losses. (June 21st, United Press dispatch)

Washington – The Vichy Ambassador to the US, Henri-Haye, has protested to Secretary of State Hull, opposing the unfriendly act of the US sending police to guard French ships in the US. He told reporters that the United States has reacted to recent events in France, especially the progress of Franco-German cooperation. The French government is quite surprised by this, so he has discussed the general US opinion of France with Hull. According to Article 18 of the Franco-German armistice, all French air ports must be placed under German-Italian control, but this fact has been forgotten, and it must be reiterated. Under this armistice, German aircraft have the right to land at French airfields in Syria. Under the leadership of Marshal Pétain, there is only one France, so any attempt to alienate the French people will fail. France has declared that it does not intend to participate in the war, but it does not abandon the right of the French people to take the steps they deem necessary to meet their needs. He has repeatedly explained to Hull that the French government will protect its territories such as Martinique and Dakar, to reject any attempt to change their sovereignty. (June 21st, Reuters dispatch)

Vichy – Paris Radio has broadcast the news that "the French government has instructed the troops stationed on Martinique Island to prepare to defend the island against American aggression." People with inside knowledge of this matter have neither acknowledged nor confirmed this statement. (June 20th, Havas dispatch)

New York – Diplomatic sources in Washington say that the French aircraft carrier "Béarn" and the cruiser "Berlin" are preparing to leave Martinique Island, possibly carrying a large amount of gold reserves. (June 20th, TASS dispatch)

Washington – Well-informed sources here say that the US believes that France's permission for German aircraft to use Syrian airfields to attack British forces in Iraq is beyond the scope of the armistice agreement. Secretary of State Hull conveyed this opinion when he met with French Ambassador Henri-Haye yesterday and told him that the world believes that elements tending toward the Axis powers are manipulating the Vichy government. If this impression is wrong, then Vichy should correct it. (June 21st, Reuters dispatch)

Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday sarcastically compared the port of Dakar in Africa to Tangdan on the Sino-Vietnamese border, which was occupied by the Japanese army in Guangxi last year. Last year, during the Republican campaign, the nation was warned that Roosevelt would send America to war to defend the poor land of Tangdan. This year, isolationists may again use Dakar as the same excuse. However, the President did not elaborate on the Dakar issue, and observers are quite puzzled. The US government may take direct action to prevent Dakar from falling into German hands. (June 21st, United Press dispatch)

### Vichy's Pro-Nazi Policy; Deteriorating Anglo-French Relations; Britain Requests Recall of French Consul-General in London; Closure of British Consulates in Syria in Retaliation

London – Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned last night that although the Vichy government severed diplomatic relations with Britain last year, the British government still allowed the French Consul-General in London, Chatel, to remain in London, enjoying slightly restricted diplomatic privileges, in order to carry out some limited consular functions. Recently, due to the Vichy government's actions that harmed the British government, the British government requested the recall of Chatel. The Vichy side used this as an excuse to request the British Consul Harvard to leave Beirut. It is reported that Harvard has already left the country, and the French authorities have requested all British consulate officials stationed in Syria to leave the country within eight days. (June 21st, Reuters dispatch)

Vichy – A communiqué issued here yesterday stated that General Dentz, the French High Commissioner in Syria, instructed by the Foreign Ministry, notified the British Consul-General in Lebanon on Friday to cease operations and leave the country immediately. This action is a retaliatory measure because the British government has expelled the French Consul-General in London. According to dispatches from Beirut, after British aircraft attacked Syrian airfields, the French government decided to cease the activities of all British consulates in Syria and Lebanon and asked them to leave the country within a week. (June 21st, Reuters dispatch)

### General Bogatsch Flew to Paris; Franco-German Reconciliation and Cooperation; Negotiations Continue

London – Paris Radio reports that German General Commander Bogatsch flew to Paris this morning. General Stülpnagel, commander of the occupying forces in France, greeted him at the airport. Bogatsch inspected the honor guard and then went to Paris with Stülpnagel, where they will hold talks. (June 21st, Reuters dispatch)

Vichy – Franco-German negotiations in Paris are currently underway, and it is reported that French associate Darlan has met with Laval. Therefore, it is expected here this morning that a Franco-German agreement can be reached soon. Parisian newspapers controlled by the Germans have resumed fierce attacks on the United States. All newspapers have the same tone, saying that since the United States failed to respond to France's appeal for help in 1940, it has no right to make suggestions to France now. (June 21st, United Press dispatch)

### Regarding the Sinking of the Aileen "Sansen" Ship; US Government Negotiates with Germany; Demands Release of American Passengers

Washington – It was announced last night that the State Department had sent a telegram to the US Embassy in Berlin, instructing it to investigate the whereabouts of the American passengers on the "Sansen" that was sunk by a German warship. This move seems to be a preparation for the US to demand the release of the rescued Americans. According to Berlin, these rescued people have been sent to a port in western France. The United States may demand the immediate release of the rescued Americans and try to transport them back to the country. Amidst the tension in German-American relations, Germany may not reject the US request. According to current reports, because the German ship that sank the Aileen strictly observed international law, it is expected that the United States will not protest. (June 21st, United Press dispatch)

### Major General Dobbie Succeeds as Governor of Malta; Air Raid Alarms Six Times a Day; German Aircraft Bomb Military Targets

London – The Colonial Office announced last night that it has appointed Major General Dobbie as Governor of Malta, replacing Sir Jackson. (June 21st, Reuters dispatch)

Berlin – According to information received here, German dive bombers attacked military targets in Valletta, Malta, this morning and were quite successful. (June 21st, Huitong News Agency dispatch)

Malta – Malta issued six air raid warnings yesterday. The communiqué stated that during the first alarm in the early morning, a small number of enemy planes came to drop bombs, causing considerable damage to civilian houses, with slight casualties. Then enemy fighter planes guarded more bombers that came to drop bombs from high altitude. Anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, and there were no casualties among the soldiers. (June 21st, Reuters dispatch)

Random Talks on the European War (58)

### Italy Under the Control of the German Political Police

This is another report made by David, the US Christian Science Monitor correspondent stationed in Rome, after returning home. It is translated as follows:

Most of the major cities in Italy are already under the control of the German political police. Mussolini's intention was to use them to suppress domestic revolutionary conspiracies.

When the reporter left Rome in late February this year, the German plan to control Italy was largely completed. Their strategy was simple and effective, carried out in secret, and the Italians were kept in the dark. Under the guise of technology, they continuously sent political advisors, administrative experts, economic regulators, military inspection teams, and political police to operate. When the Italian army was repeatedly defeated in Africa, the German political police dispatched a large number of personnel to various departments of the Italian government to study measures to suppress rebellion. At the turn of January and February this year, the Italian government was increasingly demoralized under the shadow of defeat, and government affairs almost came to a standstill, so the Germans took over at their leisure.

The reporter discovered this invisible occupation as early as the beginning of November last year. At that time, a team of German political police was stationed in the Viminal Palace, where the Ministry of the Interior is located. It is said that their mission was to support the pro-German faction in the Italian political police force in order to deal with the anti-German moderates.

Paglini, the director of the Italian political police, was a person who was outwardly stern but inwardly weak and was extremely anxious about this situation. One day, he said to a close friend, "I am maintaining the situation day by day now. Once I can't maintain it, I will have to let the Germans take over all the power."

This was at the beginning of November. By the end of the month, Paglini had indeed resigned and left the subordinates of Himmler, the director of the German political police, to do whatever they wanted. At the same time, the personnel inside the German Embassy and the German News Agency were also thriving, but the newcomers were mostly idle.

Most Italians were paying attention to the war and had no time to take care of domestic affairs. Even if there were insightful people, they could only sigh helplessly. In early February this year, a diplomat with the most well-informed sources in Rome told me, "The Germans' deployment has been completed, but the Italian people still know nothing."

I asked him if Mussolini himself was aware of what his pro-German subordinates were doing. He replied, "No."

The above is the story of an invisible revolution. As for the German army, as of the beginning of January this year, only the air force was stationed on Sicily. In addition, there were one or two armored divisions that had also been sent there to protect the air force and prevent British attacks. It was not until early February, when the internal crisis in Italy deepened, that the German army began to arrive continuously, but they did not go to northern Italy, where the anti-German atmosphere was stronger. They went directly to the port of Naples and Sicily in order to operate from there towards Tripoli, Bizerte, and French territories in Africa. It is said that there may be as many as eighteen German divisions entering Italy. We foreign reporters in Rome were at a loss for a while, thinking that such a large army could not be concealed, especially since everyone was discussing this matter. But we did not see these troops. It was not until we sat down and calculated the exact number of German army and air force personnel stationed in Italy that we discovered that this news was not unfounded.

We estimated that the German Air Force stationed 600 aircraft in Sicily to control the Strait of Sicily, requiring 21,000 personnel. These personnel, along with their equipment, could fill fifty or sixty trains. This was told to us by an expert familiar with the German air force organization.

The Germans in Weimar said that the German and Italian armies should not be mixed. The German army could act freely, and the Italian side should not obstruct them. At that time, there were rumors in Yugoslavia that anti-German movements had occurred in Milan, but in reality, it was still peaceful. During my stay in Italy, I did not hear of any serious anti-German demonstrations anywhere. The Germans acted cautiously everywhere, not wanting to give the general Italian public an excuse to oppose them.

However, this strategy of the Germans sometimes backfired. A friend of the reporter's in Italy witnessed a conflict between Italians and German officers. It happened in a small restaurant in a city in northern Italy where three German officers walked in for a meal. When they were paying the bill, one of the officers suddenly returned the bill and asked for it to be opened in German.

The shopkeeper hurriedly gave him a menu and explained in Italian that the prices were very fair, but the officer was unmoved. All the diners in the hall were angry and silently listened to the shopkeeper telling him that no one in the shop understood German.

The German officer lost his temper and said, "These places will be ours sooner or later!"

### Leaders and Businessmen Held a Grand Banquet Yesterday Afternoon to Celebrate Sino-American Trade Week; Congratulatory Messages from the US Ambassador and Others Extolled and Encouraged; Commercial and Cultural Relations between the Two Countries Will Be Further Developed

This year is the 7th Sino-American Trade Week. The American community in Shanghai held a grand banquet at the American Club on Fuzhou Road yesterday afternoon to celebrate. During the banquet, US Commercial Counselor Coulter and Pan Enlin, President of China Travel Service, delivered important speeches successively. What is even more noteworthy is that US Secretary of Commerce Jones, US Chamber of Commerce President Hawkes, US Foreign Trade Association President Farrell, and newly appointed US Ambassador to China Gauss all sent congratulatory messages to Shanghai, expressing admiration for the courage and determination of the American businessmen in Shanghai, and expressing their determination to protect US interests in China. This proves that the United States, both the government and the public, are paying attention to Sino-American trade. Since the Sino-Japanese War and the European War, although the international situation has become abnormal, the figures for Sino-American trade have continued to increase. This is the result of the continuous efforts of Chinese and American people. Future development can be predicted. The relations between the two countries will definitely become more friendly and closer.

A Gathering of Talents; An Unprecedented Grand Occasion

Those who attended the grand banquet yesterday afternoon included, on the American side, Consul General Lockhart, Consul Badger, Yangtze River Fleet Commander Glasford, senior military officer Jeeves, Judge Helmick of the US Court in China, Finance Counselor Assistant Byron, and Ms. Smith, Director of the US Trade Office in Shanghai. On the Chinese side were Zhu Chuanquan, Manager of the Four Banks Joint Treasury, Zhang Yuelian, Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank, Xie Runming and Gu Shanchang, Assistant Managers of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, He De Kui, Chinese Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, Yan Deqing, and other leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors. The chairman was Nichols, Acting President of the American Chamber of Commerce, who first gave a speech, then introduced Pan Enlin, President of China Travel Service, and Coulter, US Commercial Counselor, to speak successively. Finally, the congratulatory messages from the US government and the public to Shanghai were read aloud. It was a gathering of talents, with clinking glasses and lively atmosphere, which was more grand than in previous years.

The Chairman Highly Praised China's Greatness

In his speech, Chairman Nichols said, "Although China has suffered many losses after the war, I firmly believe that it will be able to fully restore its original state in the future, and the future commercial relations between China and the United States will be even closer." Nichols also said, "The special work that we have contributed to the prosperity of the entire world is to promote the commercial relations between the great Three Principles of the People Republic and our motherland. Among us, there are those who have lived in the Far East for a long time and have gained experience in Sino-American trade. They all know that China and the United States have a special relationship, because the two countries can communicate with each other and complement each other's needs."

Mr. Pan Enlin's Eloquent Speech

The speech of Mr. Pan Enlin, President of China Travel Service, meant that "at a time when transportation is frequently disrupted and trade is extremely difficult after the war, our commemoration of Sino-American Trade Week is of great significance. Currently, China's trade with the United States is more than that with any other country, which shows that the people of China and the United States already have very good friendship and commercial relations, so they can still have new developments in a state of war, and it is enough to prove that war can create new environments and meanings for trade. China's somewhat immature transportation methods and low-level laborers are now making great contributions to Sino-American trade. Before the war, the freight cost for each ton of goods transported from the Yangtze River to Chongqing was only 60 yuan. After the war, it cost 240 yuan to transport it via the Yuehan Railway, 1,000 yuan to transport it via Vietnam, and 10,000 yuan to transport it via the Yunnan-Burma Road. In terms of route, half of it had to pass through the Asian region, which was 3,300 miles, and the means of transportation were very complicated, with limited carrying capacity, and required manual assistance. The work was both complicated and, due to air raids, there was no loss. However, the Chinese people have always been able to overcome this difficulty with their spirit of hard work and sacrifice. This is something that should be especially praised when we commemorate Sino-American Trade Week, and we urge American people to give them enthusiastic support. Currently, the inland has a large workforce and abundant products, and transportation is also more convenient than in the early days of the war. Therefore, the basic conditions for Sino-American trade have been met. Therefore, we can firmly believe that the trade between China and the United States will have greater development in the future."

The United States is the Most Valued Customer in the Far East

In his speech, Counselor Coulter first mentioned that Shanghai's import trade this year has greatly increased, but we must pay attention to the fact that some of the practical goods can be replaced by Chinese goods. It is not a good phenomenon to replace Chinese goods with foreign goods. Regarding the difficulty of transporting American goods to China, Coulter also explained that the United States is actively expanding its military equipment, which has hindered the production of other aspects. For example, the current maximum output of steel is 83 million tons per year, but the domestic consumption in the United States is 110 million to 120 million tons. Therefore, the production of various industries in the United States is currently insufficient. If Shanghai wants to purchase American goods, the difficulty will inevitably increase. Coulter also said that the United States is the best customer in the Far East, purchasing more goods each year than it sells to the Far East. He firmly believes that the United States will pay attention to the resources that flow to the Far East in the future, which will benefit the people of the countries concerned.

Congratulatory Messages from the American Government and Public

(1) US Secretary of Commerce Jones sent a congratulatory message, saying, "On behalf of the US Department of Commerce, I would like to extend my warm regards to the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai on the occasion of the Sino-American Trade Week banquet held in Shanghai. You are still able to continue to shoulder your admirable work in Shanghai as usual, and you have not been deterred by the difficulties in Shanghai and other places. In addition to congratulating you, I wish you all success in your efforts. (2) US Chamber of Commerce President Hawkes's congratulatory message said, "We who are participating in the commemoration of Sino-American Trade Week here would like to extend our sincere congratulations to the business leaders in China. We express our gratitude for your continued efforts to promote commercial and cultural relations between China and the United States." (3) US Foreign Trade Association President Farrell's congratulatory message said, "I sincerely and enthusiastically join you in commemorating Sino-American Trade Week, and I can assure you that when you encounter special difficulties, we will make every effort to promote trade relations between China and the United States with the utmost urgency." (4) Newly appointed US Ambassador to China Gauss's congratulatory message said, "I deeply regret that I am unable to attend today's grand banquet to commemorate Sino-American Trade Week and celebrate with you. But I remember when I decided to go to Shanghai, I heard that the American community still had the determination to continue operating its business. I am deeply grateful for this. Therefore, I can now assure you that I will do my best to protect American interests in Shanghai and other parts of China in order to promote trade between China and the United States."

### Dividends on Commercial Shares of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications Will Be Advanced First

The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications issued notices for the payment of dividends, saying: (1) The Bank of China has now resolved through a trial decision by the Bank's General Affairs Committee that, since the Bank's shareholders are scattered all over the country, the shareholders' meeting for this year will be convened after the situation stabilizes. It has also been resolved to advance the commercial share dividend for the 29th year at a rate of 7%, which will be submitted for approval at the shareholders' meeting. The payment will begin on June 2nd.

### Rice Shops Adulterating Hong Kong Rice for Sale; Business Licenses Revoked; Citizens Hope Authorities Impose Severe Penalties

Since the Concession authorities directly ordered a large quantity of Yangon special small-grain rice from the Hong Kong government, it has been widely sold in the retail departments of rice shops in this city, with remarkable results, greatly benefiting the common people. However, there are indeed unscrupulous rice merchants who, with malicious intent, dare to outwardly comply but inwardly defy, adulterating the rice for sale and deceiving residents. The Shi Changyi Rice Shop at No. 225 Jaxi Road in the French Concession was found to be

Attempting to Sell Mixed Rice

While selling Hong Kong rice yesterday, a secret agent dispatched by the French Bureau was present and discovered that the Hong Kong rice sold by the shop

was different from the samples. Upon closer inspection, it was indeed mixed with inferior grains, attempting to sell it for profit. The secret agent reported the actual situation to the French Concession authorities, stating that the rice shop had violated the regulations for selling rice. It is now known that the shop's business license has been revoked by the French authorities, ordering it to cease operations. Two or three other rice shops have also been penalized by the authorities for adulteration. Furthermore, Zhao Junsun, the owner of Yongchang Rice Shop at No. 278 Datong Road in the Public Concession, was found on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 20th) by a Western police officer to have sold the Municipal Council's affordable Hong Kong rice with suspected adulteration. The Western police officer reported the information to the Municipal Council, and in the afternoon at 3 p.m., the Municipal Council, together with Xiang Mao Foreign Firm, sent personnel to investigate. Whether there was adulteration could not be ascertained at that time. However, it is heard that Xiang Mao Foreign Firm has already decided to revoke the rice shop's right to sell the Municipal Council's Hong Kong rice.

Large-Scale Purchase of French

The temporary restrictions on the sale of rice have been lifted, so factories and schools in this city are purchasing in large quantities from various rice shops. Yesterday, Pinghe Foreign Firm at No. 4 Beijing Road, due to its large number of employees, purchased 1,000 bags from a nearby rice shop. The rice shop, considering the large quantity, did not dare to sell rashly and applied to Xiang Mao Foreign Firm, which sent personnel to Pinghe Foreign Firm to verify the facts and granted permission for the sale. If similar situations occur in other rice shops, they must also apply to Xiang Mao and can only trade after permission is granted.

Rice Cart Allocation

The strike by rice cart workers has been resolved. It is stipulated that from now on, rice transportation should first be done by rubber-wheeled carts, with any excess transported by trucks, restoring the pre-war state. (2) To prevent disputes over rice transportation, the number of rubber-wheeled carts is set at 250 to 300, and the number of rice trucks is set at 40. (3) To prevent rice-grabbing incidents, an inspection team is organized to monitor each rice warehouse. (4) The words "Rubber Rice Cart" and a number are affixed to the carts to prevent other rubber carts from fraudulently engaging in transportation. The cart workers have also agreed with the Rice Merchants Association to abolish the long-term contract system and organize a Rice Cart Company. In the future, all rice shops must notify the Rice Cart Company when shipping goods, and the company will allocate work. This should come into effect next month. The workers, regarding this dispute, were fortunate to receive the enthusiastic support of Zhu Zixiang and Fu Qiangeng, the main leaders of the Rice Merchants Association in the North and South Cities, and specially sent representatives to express their gratitude yesterday.

Automobile Drivers: "Don't Be Impatient"

Automobile horn sound promotion week, yesterday was the third day, the results are quite good, it is heard that the person in charge of the General Traffic Department of the Municipal Council said, the Great Light, Cathay, Nanjing, and Greater Shanghai cinemas, from the 19th of this month, before each screening, play promotional clips in Chinese and English, "Friends, don't be impatient, you're not going to put out a fire, and no one is chasing you, why are you desperately pressing the horn?" At the same time, there were several very loud horn sounds. The second clip is "That's right, just press it like this, how pleasant," at that time only a low horn sound was emitted once. It is heard that the item interpolation will continue to be promoted until this Saturday. It is found that about half of the audience in the number of cinemas are car owners, so the above propaganda should get a very large effect.

### Initial Signs of a Coal Price Drop; Price per Ton Has Fallen by Forty to Fifty Yuan from Its Peak; Retail Coal Ball Prices Fall, But Large Factories Still Try to Control Them

Recently, the coal market has seen an increasing abundance of spot goods. Holders of goods are all lowering prices to seek sales. Not only has the informal market gradually disappeared, but also the prices of various types of bituminous coal in the market have continued to decline. On average, the price per ton of coal has fallen by as much as forty to fifty yuan compared to its peak. Spot

Lack of Consultants: It is said that the market price of various types of bituminous coal in this city is currently unstable and will soon experience a sharp decline. However, the prices offered by holders of goods have been quite disparate recently. Dateli white coal is offered at some with 415 yuan, while some offer at 411 or 412 yuan, and Kaiping No. 1 lump is priced at 370 or 380 yuan. As for the coal ball factory prices, although they still maintain the original price of 296 yuan per ton, the informal market has fallen directly from 330 yuan to around 270 yuan. Retailers of various coal merchants also

Lowered Values for Sale: Prices are uncertain at 14 yuan and 15 yuan, mostly at 14.5 yuan, but a few large coal ball factories are still unwilling to lower the original price and are still thinking of struggling. The reasons for this decision on the decline in coal prices are approximately as follows: (1) The authorities of the two concessions have shifted their attention and are paying attention to the scope of activities of coal merchants, so speculative coal merchants are not only frightened, but also subject to many constraints; (2) The number of coal transport ships has increased, the source of bituminous coal has surged, the inventory is full, and the spot goods in the market are sluggish; (3) The climate has turned hot, the use of coal has decreased, and the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, so holders of goods are eager to sell and realize cash to facilitate turnover.

Reuters Employees: Loyal Service; The Company and Employees Have Long Had an Understanding; Private Membership in Groups Is Unrelated to the Company

Reuters News: It is easy to cause misunderstanding that there have recently been activities to organize groups among the workers of Reuters News Agency in this city. Reuters hereby declares the truth. The so-called organization of groups has been denied by the workers, and they have stated that they will abide by the company's rules and serve loyally. What the company cares about is the service and dedication of its employees. As for the private affairs of employees joining legal groups outside of work, the company does not want to interfere. The company and its employees have long had an understanding. If employees have complaints, the company is happy to consider them and do its best to ensure that they can work with peace of mind. All kinds of rumors are not credible.

### American School Buildings to Be Leased Separately; Will Be Leased to the Police Department and YMCA; When Classes Will Resume Cannot Be Said at Present

Most of the American women and children in Shanghai have withdrawn, and the number of students at the Shanghai American School on Beidang Road has sharply decreased, so it has been temporarily suspended, and there is no hope of reopening for a while. It is now heard that the authorities are currently considering leasing the school playground separately to the French Police Department and the Western YMCA for use as sports fields, which is quite likely to be realized. Most of the current American School staff have left Shanghai, and another group is also about to leave. The school building is left to the care of staff member Kinna. When the school will resume classes cannot be said, but the school board will consider the possibility of resuming classes as soon as the number of American children in Shanghai increases.

Grade B Barber Shop Labor Dispute: Forcibly Striking and Causing Trouble

Regarding the dispute over barber shops violating regulations, the guild stated that the Xu Dengji Barber Shop on Zhejiang Road has followed the mediation record and has not deviated in the slightest since the labor and capital signed the conditions. Xu Dengji is indeed a Grade B shop with a 3-5 split of income and two porridges and one meal. However, the workers unilaterally demanded two meals and one porridge, and suddenly on May 15th, they all left the shop and went on strike automatically. Xu Dengji was forced to recruit new workers and continue to operate normally. Suddenly, on the morning of the 20th of this month, the trade union led dozens of workers, with great momentum, along the north end of Shandong Road, Shanxi Road, and Avenue Edward VII, forcing workers in various barber shops to go on strike immediately. Most workers were unwilling to strike, and workers fought each other, but soon all resumed work. The labor unrest ended two hours later.

### The Orphan's Paradise (3)

— Liu

After coming out of the first-grade classroom, I returned to the various parts of the first floor of the foreign-style house I had just visited to observe. There were classrooms, handicraft rooms, and a school for the deaf and mute. Some of the students in the deaf and mute school were having Chinese class, and some were learning abacus with written calculations. I asked curiously, can a mute pronounce words and read books? They said: Yes; that is, under the instruction of a kind of gesture, he actually read the Chinese sentences in the textbook one by one, but his pronunciation was more clumsy and not as clear as ordinary people! However, the ability of a mute to speak was previously considered impossible, but now, with the development of educational technology, it is possible to make up for natural defects!

In addition, there are five parts, which are places for graduate students to learn skills. The overall leader is Father Lu, and each part has Chinese and Western leaders who manage and specialized technicians to guide them. The five parts are:

(1) Graphics Department: Divided into watercolor, pencil, oil painting, and colored glass;

(2) Printing Department: Divided into lithography, letterpress printing, and color printing;

(3) Carpentry Department: Divided into production, sampling, carving, and painting;

(4) Hardware Department: Divided into gilding, silver plating, and sand casting;

(5) Photography Department: Divided into copper plate, zinc plate, and glass plate;

We visited part by part, spending a full three hours, and it was still a hasty visit. I excerpted Wu Jizha's words as the conclusion of my visit, the so-called "there is nothing more to add to this, it is the ultimate!" Indeed, integrating labor and study, no one is abandoned and nothing is wasted, everyone does their best, and everyone gets what they need. If this spirit is promoted to various undertakings, I can say that no undertaking will fail.

The handicrafts produced by the institute are all exquisite; the products of the carpentry department and the hardware department are all exquisitely made, large and small, of various shapes and colors. I saw that most of the buyers were Westerners, who traveled far to Tushan Bay to buy, which shows that the credibility of the products is very strong, so they can be sold to Southeast Asia, India, and the United States and France. The products of the graphics department won as many as nineteen awards at the Nanyang Industrial Exposition; they were also displayed at the Nanjing National Products Exhibition and won many awards. However, the product that can be called the only one in the Far East is the colored glass; the figures are painted on it, and after special treatment, they will never fade. The various statues displayed in the carving department are the ones we see in the church, lined up here. There is also a statue of Xu Guangqi, wearing a red robe and gauze hat, with vivid expression. In addition, bronze statues are also made for people. I once saw a half-length statue, which is said to be made for a Chen family in Pudong.

The factory part is a production undertaking, which is not only sufficient to be self-sufficient, but also the income from the sale of industrial products accounts for the main part of the orphanage's income; now it is not, the mainland is cut off due to traffic obstructions, which is equivalent to being cut off; overseas, the European war is spreading, and sales are declining. In addition, what it relies on to pay for expenses is the donations from Chinese and Western people.

### Car Accident: Tragic Scene on the Street

Wang Shen, a woman from Suzhou, 43 years old, was walking along Avenue Edward VII opposite the Gongwu Stage at 12:30 noon yesterday, intending to cross the road from north to south. A public bus happened to be parked at the station. The woman crossed in front of the public bus. Unexpectedly, a China Moving Company truck, No. 17042, drove out from behind the public bus. The driver of the truck (No. 431) saw a woman crossing the road ahead and could not brake in time, causing it to hit her. As the woman was lying on the ground, a Westerner's car came speeding from towards the west, hitting her again and injuring her brain. Blood flowed from her mouth and nose, and she was dying. A nearby Chinese police officer summoned an ambulance and sent her to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of her injuries, she died soon after. A reporter from this newspaper happened to be passing by and witnessed the tragic scene. He quickly took out his camera and photographed the situation. (Top picture) Police officers arrived at the scene to investigate the situation. (Bottom picture) The blood stains left on the ground by the deceased were circled with white powder by the police.

### Yuan Yu Exchange House Robbed of Large Sum Yesterday Morning - Total Amount Stolen Reached 70,000 Yuan - One Thief Captured, 30,000 Yuan Recovered

Yesterday morning at 8:40 AM, five robbers suddenly broke into Yuan Yu Exchange House, located on the second floor, rooms 209 and 210, of the building at No. 40 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Jiangxi Road. They robbed the business of 62,000 yuan in legal tender and 4,496 yuan in Japanese military currency. They attempted to escape with the loot but one robber was apprehended. The details of the incident are as follows:

Bound Employees

At the time, five robbers, one wearing a gray short-sleeved shirt and shorts, and the others wearing blue long gowns, walked up to the second floor and burst into room 205. Two robbers pulled out handguns, threatening the four employees inside, forbidding them from making a sound, and demanding the key to the safe. However, the employees did not have the key and could not hand it over. The robbers then used hemp rope to bind the four employees and a tea servant, forcing them to sit and wait for other employees who arrived later. These arriving employees were also intercepted and confined in room 210.

Stole Liberally and Left

It was not until 9:30 AM that the manager of the exchange house, Gao Guangcai, walked in confidently. Upon seeing the situation, he knew it was difficult to escape. The robbers threatened him with a gun, forcing him to hand over the safe key. Gao had no choice but to comply, allowing the robbers to steal 62,000 yuan in legal tender and 4,496 yuan in Japanese military currency, which were deposited by a cloth company from Wuxi. They packed the money and attempted to flee downstairs. A nearby patrolman heard the commotion and immediately reported to the police station. A large number of detectives were dispatched by car to the scene to surround and search the building. One robber wearing short-sleeved shirt and shorts was captured on the spot at the entrance. 30,000 yuan of the stolen money was recovered. Two suspects were also apprehended. The people and the recovered money were taken back to the police station. The employees of the exchange house were also asked to identify the robbers and the remaining robbers are being pursued.

Car Insurance Policy Transfer Dispute - Datong Company Wins Lawsuit

Datong Company, located at 1460 Jing'an Temple Road, had a dispute with Wu Ruisheng regarding the transfer of a car insurance policy. The two parties were unable to resolve the issue, so Wu filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, seeking 6,068.71 yuan in damages. Wu had purchased a Nash car from Datong Company, and Datong issued an insurance policy stating that free repairs would be provided within three months. Later, Wu sold the car to someone else and requested that Datong transfer the insurance policy. Datong refused, arguing that the policy had expired and that the car had never been inspected as required during the policy period, making a transfer impossible according to the agreement. As a result, Wu was unable to sell the car. Although he later sold it to another buyer, the selling price was reduced. Wu considered this a loss and filed a lawsuit. After several court hearings, the court ruled in favor of Datong Company, dismissing the plaintiff's claim and ordering Wu Ruisheng to bear the litigation costs.

Robbers Steal Car - False Rumor of Wang Shuxian Being Kidnapped

Yesterday, various newspapers reported that Wang Yiting's third son, Wang Shuxian, was kidnapped along with his car in front of the Paramount Ballroom. It has been clarified that this was a false rumor. The previous evening, Wang drove his private car, number 1317, to the ballroom. The driver, Shen Genquan, parked the car nearby. Around 11:40 PM, Wang had not yet emerged from the ballroom. Suddenly, three robbers opened the car door. Shen, who was leaning back in his seat, dozing off, was awakened by the robbers. As he was about to ask what they wanted, he saw the robbers brandishing pistols. He was forced to allow the three robbers to get into the car and ordered to drive west. At the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Difeng Road, the robbers pushed Shen out of the car and drove away themselves, disappearing without a trace. The stolen car has not yet been recovered as of yesterday.

### Grains - Without the Public Sale of Rice by the Bureau of Public Works, How Could the Rice Market Have Collapsed So Completely? - Indirectly Lowered the Shipping Costs from Rangoon

Yesterday's rice market fluctuated again, initially weakening before rising, ultimately trending towards weakness again. When the market opened in the morning, due to the prevailing weakness of the previous day, the prices of all grades of rice continued to decline. After prices fell, actual sales by local merchants and low-price buying by new speculators caused the market to rise again, with prices increasing by a small amount of one or two yuan in the morning and rising by three or four yuan at noon. However, in the later market, sales by foreign merchants and confirmation of lower shipping costs caused the market to fall again. As a result, the final prices were still weaker than the previous evening. Small-grained rice opened at 104 yuan, falling to 102 yuan, and then rising to 107.5 yuan. Saigon No. 1 was at its lowest at 111 yuan, and then rose to 114 yuan. No. 2 ranged from 103 yuan to 106 yuan. Siamese No. 1 ranged from 106 yuan to 108-9 yuan, once falling to 99 yuan, and then rising to 102 yuan. Yinghua Company's Saigon No. 1 rice for April/May delivery was 132.5 yuan to 135 yuan, small pattern rice was 129 yuan to 127 yuan, and broken rice was 95 yuan to 99 yuan. In the afternoon, Dafu Foreign Firm sold 1,000 tons of small-grained rice for June delivery, with buyers bidding 116 yuan, and it was rumored that a deal was made at 127 yuan. Because shipping costs have been confirmed to be lower, with Rangoon freight rates, formerly 220 shillings per ton, now only 150 shillings, the cost has decreased, and future shipments can be continuously arranged. Therefore, market sentiment was weak, and both spot and futures prices were lowered by two or three yuan. The total daily turnover was 27,000 bags of spot rice, and Yinghua Company also had several thousand tons.

Domestic rice, such as thick and thin japonica rice, was generally weaker in the early market due to the continued decline in foreign rice. Most dealers feared another storm and were unwilling to hold firm, and local shops were also unusually quiet, so prices fell by two yuan. Wuxi fresh white japonica rice was 132 yuan, Kun japonica rice was 130 yuan, then falling to 126 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice was 127-8 yuan, then falling to 124 yuan, with original packaging at 128 yuan.

Glutinous rice, after a brief rebound in the previous market, saw a renewed decline in demand. At the same time, many holders were eager to sell at the higher prices, resulting in oversupply and difficulty in maintaining prices, falling by one or two yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong white glutinous rice was 110 yuan to 108 yuan, glutinous tea was 100 yuan to 98 yuan, and domestic glutinous rice was 120 yuan.

Flour Market Hovering Again

Yesterday's flour market was similar to that of foreign flour, having entered a hovering state. Trading in the morning was particularly quiet. Dealers, considering that the cost of raw materials for Chinese mills' commonly sold flour remained high at 29 yuan, which was higher than current prices for foreign flour, were unwilling to lower prices further. However, there was no strong demand from buyers, and trading was stagnant. Only 500 bags of Pao Tai brand American flour were traded, priced at 29.1 yuan. In the afternoon, the situation improved slightly, as some merchants made small purchases at low prices, and the price of Pao Tai flour rose to 29.5 yuan. However, Golden Dragon flour continued to be affected by large inventories and dumping by other brands, and the market remained difficult to improve. Golden Dragon flour was priced at 28.1 to 28.3 yuan, and Double Eagle brand flour was priced at 28.5 yuan, with some differences in actual prices. Pao Tai flour rose by 0.2 yuan, while Golden Dragon flour fell slightly by 0.3 yuan. The market has entered a hovering state. The commonly sold flour remained unchanged, but the retail prices of Fuxin and Navy Ship brands at various stores had been raised to 30.05 yuan. Today, 2,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Xiamen.

Wheat - Yesterday's wheat market remained quiet. Because old wheat had already been ordered to be taken down, the flour mills were waiting for the new wheat to come on the market before buying. The market has been stagnant for a long time. It is said that the actual price of Gao Du wheat old stocks remains between 45 and 46 yuan per 100 catties, which can be described as having a price but no market.

Dried Goods - Orchid Bamboo Shoots Rebound

Finance - Hong Kong Limits Prices - Closing to Take in US Dollars

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw rates listed, with the rates announced at 9:30 AM. The British exchange rate was listed at 0.0625, calculated at three pence one eight seven five. The new exchange rate was listed at 0.25, and the Indian and Hong Kong exchange rates were listed at approximately 0.275. Exchange rates for American, French and German currency were steady, but had no market. The informal British and American exchange market reversed in direction, softening. Consequently, Chinese merchants and speculators started to offset previously held short positions, and since foreign merchants were in need to reduce positions it was unexpected when Hong Kong telegraphed less offers. Later, Hong Kong suddenly limited the price of US dollars to 5.40625 yuan, and had to take in 200,000 US dollars, while the price of gold was bid up to 6400 yuan. The British exchange was weakened down to the close, trading at three pence two nine six eight seven five, and US dollars trading at 5.375 yuan. The price of gold was pushed up to the close. Trading for half the day was active. There was no market on Tuesday afternoon.

Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Extends Limits, Reverses Informal Market

From the morning wires, rates for Indian and British silver were flat and the foreign rates for currency were similar between America and England. In the morning banks in Shanghai started with a selling price of three pence three one two five for the British exchange rate, and 5.40625 yuan for American exchange rates. In an instance, the prices from the top level were hard to settle, but at 9:20 AM, the Hong Kong wire came with the sale of a limited few and US dollars were sold at 5.40625 yuan from the Chinese banks and an American bank that offered the same price at the same time. The Shanghai and Hong Kong Bank marked up the rate for American currency, while the silver tax balanced at 24.25 percent. Speculators tried to offset previously held short positions and it was overheard that the Hong Kong wire was offering 5.40625 yuan, bringing in a large amount, leaving the banks not as willing to offer. Speculators bid on 5.375 yuan for May and June, causing the currency market to soften. The British rate then tightened up, where at the close of 12 AM, the British currency was offered at three pence two nine six eight seven five and the US currency was offered at 5.375 yuan, causing the British rate to tighten up at 0.015625 and the American rate to tighten up at 0.03125.

Gold Market Offset Short Positions and Prices Climb - Spot Prices Must Be 300 Yuan Higher

Yesterday's informal gold market rebounded and prices climbed, breaking through the 6,400 yuan mark, as rumors of negative news subsided. Foreign exchange was tightened by speculators covering short positions and by Hong Kong's price limits and aggressive buying. All parties' confidence improved, and securities firms covered short positions and increased holdings, while retail investors bought in, so despite the emergence of Xin Feng Yong, a bill merchant, to sell, demand still exceeded supply. Prices rose from 6,385 yuan in the morning to 6,420 yuan, a rebound of 42 yuan. The total trading volume for half a day was 32,000 taels. There was no market outside the exchange in the afternoon. The backwardation (May rolling into June) continued to rise.

Defu, Xinyuan, Dafeng, and Shi He actively bought in, continuing to push up the price by 25 yuan, breaking through 6,400 yuan, reaching 6,410 yuan, which was sold by Chengji, Xinfeng Yong, Gonghe, and Chi Da. Furthermore, with the next month's dollar price at 5.40625 yuan, sold by an American bank, the price fell back 23 yuan, to 6,387 yuan, and was bought by Tong Kang Yong and Yi Da Securities Firms. It hovered around 6,400 yuan, with retail short positions being covered, rising to 6,415 yuan. Then, Chengji and Xinfeng Yong emerged to sell, pushing the price down to 6,395 yuan. And hearing that next month's dollar was also softening to 5.375 yuan, Xinyuan, Tong Kang Yong, Yi Da, Chi Da, Defu, and other securities firms absorbed, gradually rising to 6,420 yuan, finally reaching 6,413 yuan. At noon, the closing price was 6,417 yuan, a rebound of 42 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Based on the closing price of 6,479.07 yuan for the June dollar at 5.375 yuan, there was a difference of 62.07 yuan. After closing, the price rose to 6,420 yuan, and finally settled at 6,417-18 yuan.

The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association remained at seven fen for both the morning and afternoon markets.

Securities - Public Debt Transactions Sluggish

The over-the-counter market for public debt was extremely dull yesterday. The market was largely controlled by a small group of holders, and as the interest payment date approached, those holding short positions were content and reluctant to take any further action. Both buyers and sellers were hesitant, and it is expected that this situation will not last long. In the morning, Hu He Xun, Shen Chang, and Lian Yi bought, while Run De, Yi Tai, and Hong Da sold, causing the market price to weaken slightly by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Trading was even quieter in the afternoon. Tong Shun and De Chang bought, while Yi Xing and Ding Kang sold, but the market price of all five types of bonds remained unchanged, at the same price as the morning close, resulting in a slight decrease of 0.1-0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 7-800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

Yarn and Cotton - With Bulls and Bears Contending, the Yarn Market Wants to Rise But Stops - One Side Sees Tight Warehouse Receipts and Refuses to Loosen, the Other Side Sees Sluggish Yarn Sales and Does Not Allow Optimism

Yesterday's yarn market, which had fallen sharply the previous day, rebounded again, but actual business was unusually sluggish. Hong Kong merchants only handled 50 bales, and other merchants had no activity at all. However, holders with sufficient capital were unwilling to give up their absorption of the 20s Double Horse factory order, so apart from fluctuations in standard yarn, everything was completely stagnant. However, the bulls argued that warehouse receipts were tight and could not be loosened, while the bears, considering the lack of sales for 20s yarn and the fact that the price of Double Horse yarn was particularly high, making it increasingly difficult to sell miscellaneous brands of yarn, coupled with the fact that the yarn sales season was ending, predicted that the future would not be optimistic. Therefore, the high price was 1,447 yuan and the low price was 1,426 yuan. In the afternoon, the upward momentum was quite strong, rising to 1,452 yuan. Then, it was heard that a certain standard yarn 20s yarn for this month closed at only 1,175 yuan, a significant difference compared to Double Horse yarn. Those who profited sold, and new buyers emerged, falling to 1,435 yuan, with the final price being 1,435-6 yuan. Today, 125 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Siam and 270 bales are being shipped to Hong Kong.

The market was flat in the morning for Double Horse yarn, but most of the traders on the floor were actively buying in anticipation of a rise. The opening price was 1,435 yuan, soon rising to 43 yuan, but there was no shortage of sellers, and it eased to 1,437 yuan. Then, hearing that spot gold rebounded, it slowly rose to 1,446 yuan, but the atmosphere in the market was quite deceptive. By the time of closing, the bulls were active again, mostly rolling over futures, briefly rising to 1,449 yuan, but spot yarn trading was sluggish. According to statistics, 10,750 bales were traded during the day. The amounts purchased by various merchants are listed as follows: Hong Kong 50, and Tong Hang 10,700, for a total of 10,750 bales.

If the Price of Yarn Does Not Rise, It Is Difficult to Expect a Recovery in the Cotton Market

Due to the small amount of yarn exports and sluggish prices, the prices for the miscellaneous brands of yarn are very low, and inventories are overstocked. So cotton sales are also affected. However, market situation of raw materials for fine yarn is another matter, but trading is not strong. Yesterday, only 200 bales of Tongzhou wood frame cotton were traded, and the price of 47 yuan was the number-to-number trade.

According to other news, the trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai foreign firms is weak, and the situation is sluggish. Yesterday, 200 bales of high-grade West Cotton were transshipped to Qingdao, and the selling price was only about 410 yuan, a difference of 10 yuan compared with the highest selling price, so it is impossible to look forward to a recovery of the cotton market in the near future.

The New York cotton market initially rose due to buying by fellow traders, but then fell slightly due to sales in New Orleans and some liquidation. As a result, the closing price was 8-9 points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market was quite weak, and the market fell due to a large amount of bull liquidation. Yesterday's closing prices all fell by 2-9 points, and the opening market today is expected to be one point higher.

### Textiles: Factory Cloth Market Conditions are Grim – Market Declines Daily –

Yesterday's factory cloth market showed a weakening trend. Sales offers saw slight increases but quickly retreated due to the approaching month-end futures delivery date. Stockpilers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and actual sales were slow. Dye factories suspended production of gray cloth, leading to an oversupply. Consequently, cloth prices continued their downward spiral. Yesterday's closing prices all showed declines, with fine white cloth falling by 50 cents, and coarse cloth and twill falling by 25 to 50 cents. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth remained unchanged, but most businesses were not actively trading. Only a few hundred pieces of coarse cloth, coarse twill, etc., were transacted in this market. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders continued to declare shipments, but interest in purchasing new goods was also weak.

On the 21st, 1,440 pieces of textiles were shipped to Hong Kong, and another 205 pieces were shipped to Siam.

Eastern cloth started with an upward trend but ultimately weakened. However, the spot market sentiment was still good. At the opening, high-grade fine cloth once rose to $47.10, but later it continued to decline based on exchange standards, closing at $46.65, a rise of 50 cents per piece. Dyed Four Gentlemen broadcloth at $1.435 also rose by 1 cent.

Autumn and Winter Woolens Hoarded

Yesterday, woolen fabric and towel surfaces were stable, while summer white goods remained weak. Autumn demand focused on Xuanwei flannel, suit woolens, single-sided woolens, four-ply Harris tweed, Wu Zhi Gong gabardine, checkered Gong board flannel, medium-thick broadcloth Hailing tweed, riding breeches woolens, and cashmere. Winter demand focused on plain-colored "Dao Chun Mao" cashmere fabric, hair woolens, pearl woolens, cloud pattern woolens, carved patterns, silver-seized various overcoat woolens, Mairden plain thick woolens, "Hai Bai Long Ma" and lamb fleece felt, and shoe woolens, etc., which remained consistently strong. Market sentiment was quite bullish, with prices being whatever the seller asked, without any standard prices.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Slightly Tight

Yesterday, the sugar market experienced a slight tightening trend due to the extremely limited number of sellers of coarse white sugar for late May delivery. Although goods en route could arrive in Shanghai within the month, customs clearance procedures would prevent delivery within the month. The association's market prices for spot goods of 1-4 coarse white sugar, and imported goods arriving in March and April, were $103.80 to $104.20, an increase of 70 cents. The initial price for futures for the end of this month was $104.50, $104, $104.50, then rising to $105, $106, and closing at $105.10, up 35 cents. Trading for goods arriving on June 10th also began, opening at $105.60, slightly softening to $104.50, $105 during the day, and then firming up again to $105.60, $105.80. Taikoo granulated white sugar B mark Western warehouse was $107.50, up 50 cents, and HX mark Western warehouse was $98, up $1. Yesterday, 15,000 bags of sugar were shipped to Tianjin.

### The Fuel Problem (Continued): When Will It Fall to the Price of Rice?

Coal briquettes are supposedly machine-made, but recently, some coal shops have also been making them by hand, using coal dust left over from coal chunks and coal briquettes. They use an iron coal briquette mold, fill it with the mixed coal dust, close it, and then the usual coal briquette is formed. After drying it in the sun, it can be sold. Chinese merchants are able to make the most of waste materials, regardless of labor costs, which is one of the reasons for their success. Because coal briquettes are too expensive, there is even a type of coal-saving powder sold in the market. According to its advertising, two cents' worth of powder can save one dollar's worth of coal briquettes. I have not tried it, but I imagine it is some kind of combustion aid. However, it can also be called being good at speculation.

In the past, water boilers and public bathhouses used flower husks (i.e., cottonseed hulls) instead of coal. This was a big thing during the Guangxu era. Later, coal prices were cheap, and the supply of flower husks was limited, so coal was used more often. Recently, coal prices have been too high, and the Ningbo Lighters Association has added restrictions, so fuel for various factories is a big problem. As a result, the use of flower husks as a substitute for coal has resurfaced. The oil factory that supplies the most flower husks in Shanghai is the Dayouyu Oil Factory on West Suzhou Road. Many factories and large spinning mills are placing daily orders for flower husks to be transported and used. The heat output is no less than that of coal, so its use is spreading. However, special stoves for flower husks need to be set up, and old coal stoves need to be modified. But flower husks are still difficult to use in homes. Coal briquettes and white coal are still indispensable fuels. We'll see when they can fall to the price of rice. (The End)

Provincial Yangzhou Middle School; Second-Year High School Students Resume Classes

The second-year high school students of the Provincial Yangzhou Middle School on Gao Naiyi Road in this city went on strike because their eight demands to the school authorities were not met. Fortunately, the school made sincere explanations to the students, and the matter was resolved satisfactorily yesterday.

A few days ago, Yang Dingba, a second-year B student at the school, was disorderly in history class and was given a major demerit and suspended from classes for three days by the school, which prevented him from taking the English exam. Although the student requested permission to take the exam, he was not allowed to. As a result, more than 90 second-year A and B students raised eight demands. Because the school did not respond to the demands, the second-year students began a strike at 8 a.m. the day before yesterday. The school made sincere explanations to the second-year students the day before yesterday, hoping that they would resume classes early. The students also expressed their willingness to accept, so classes were formally resumed by noon. The school also accommodated the students' final demand that the time of the strike not be counted as an unexcused absence. Thus, the strike was resolved satisfactorily.

### How to Study Painting (III)

— Shi Chongpeng

Once you understand how to write characters, you can start with simple paintings like plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums. Use the Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting, which is published in the market, as a reference. For example, when painting orchids, you must first paint the leaves, clearly seeing the order of the strokes from left to right, slightly distinguishing the lightness and heaviness, and brushing them off smoothly. After one, two, or even eight or ten strokes, you will have confidence. When painting plum blossoms, you must first paint the branches, from top to bottom, painting them in a natural way to show the strength of the brush. Of course, there are different methods for painting bamboo and chrysanthemums. Orchid leaves should use dark ink, orchid flowers should use light ink, chrysanthemums should use dark ink, and chrysanthemum leaves should use light ink. There should also be changes within the darkness and lightness. As long as you practice carefully and boldly, and after some time you understand the methods of using the brush and ink, then you can copy more complex paintings. Before putting pen to paper, you must first carefully study the brushwork, composition, and artistic conception of the painting, as well as the various techniques, and then start copying to have good results. These plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums are all organizations of lines, and the lines all come from the skill on the tip of the brush. Chinese painting, whether landscapes, figures, or flowers and birds, is all made up of the combination and description of lines. If the lines can be changed, lively, experienced, and calm, then the painting will definitely be good. However, this line skill cannot be achieved overnight. You must have perseverance to practice, and at the same time, you must also see more works by famous artists, study them carefully, and make references, so that you will naturally get twice the result with half the effort.

The study of Western painting completely relies on sketching as the only method, but it also starts with simple objects. According to the principles of distance, brightness, size, and perspective, compare the object and describe it with a pencil or charcoal to do basic exercises. After practicing, you can describe anything, whether static flowers, moving beasts, or the great natural scenery. From the perspective of Western painting, human body models are the most suitable objects. They have curvilinear beauty, color beauty, and spiritual beauty. Just look at the curves of the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose on the face, the four limbs, and the waist, chest, and back, which have the most changes. The color of the skin often changes the most because of the circulation of blood and the reflection of light. This kind of curvature and color is most abundant in the human body. Especially spiritual beauty is a unique strength of the human body. The expressions of joy, anger, sadness, and happiness, and the full and substantial spirit, are lacking in various objects or other animals. Therefore, human body sketching is the most important foundation in Western painting. You should first study human anatomy so that the outline can be accurate. Study optics and color science so that the changes in light and shade and the coordination of colors can achieve satisfactory results. When the sketching skills are mature, the foundation of Western painting will also be laid. Usually, before practicing the human body, use a plaster model as the object. Beginners can fully observe its outline and gradually practice from the local to the whole. If even the equipment of plaster models is not easy to obtain, then you can only start by copying model books like Chinese painting, first copying pencil drawings, then watercolors, and finally oil paintings. However, copying is only occasional and cannot be regarded as a normal method.

Psychology

### War Anxiety

— Pan Li

In England, under intense bombing, most of the public displayed an indomitable spirit, but a very small number of people felt psychological unease due to the threat of war, developing a kind of anxiety and suffering from mild neurotic disorders.

These patients were immediately cured after being examined by psychiatrists. The prescriptions used by psychiatrists were only a few words.

Strangely, most of these patients suffering from war anxiety were very eager to show courage, afraid of showing fear of war in front of others and being ridiculed. Unexpectedly, this caused psychological anxiety.

For these patients, it is only necessary to explain to them that war is a terrible thing, and it is not shameful to show anxiety about war. Everyone's psychological reaction to war is almost the same.

However, clearly seeing the environment and not being afraid to face reality is the healthiest thing.

### Child Brides

— Wave

For a long time, his image had gradually faded from my memory. Until today, when I saw his name in a book, a long, thin, sallow face with long hair reappeared in my mind.

Among my classmates, he was a thinker with a fresh perspective. He had imparted to me a lot of new knowledge, and several conversations had aroused in me a desire to "improve." He was extremely resentful of "ritualism" and often said, "I want to conquer ritualism."

One afternoon, on the lawn, I talked about my family. As I was immersed in my fantasy after finishing my story, I heard him say with a sigh, "You are much happier than I am." I was surprised and turned to look at him. Ah! I had never seen him with such a look in his eyes; a depressing secret seemed to lurk deep in his eyes. I couldn't help but ask him in a low voice.

"You would never think of it," he said, "You would never think of it. One cannot simply observe a person's daily expressions. Happy people often swallow tears in their hearts. Don't you see me always smiling? But the clouds of despair often surround my heart...

"One day when I was twelve years old, I was still an ignorant child. When I came home from school and stepped into the door, I found that there were more people in the house; they all looked at me with contempt and laughed and shouted, 'He's here, he's here.' I blushed inexplicably and ran shamefully towards my mother's room, but her room was also full of female relatives, who also looked at me with the same eyes and laughed. I lowered my head, and my heart began to stir.

"From that day on, there was one more person in the house... a girl, a child bride who was supposed to be my future wife. She brought me material to be made fun of, she brought the dark clouds that appeared when I had hope. My knowledge increased day by day, and at the same time, I felt more and more obscure about the future. When I was studying, I saw her, and my thoughts began to be confused, and my spirit began to groan. I felt that harm was useless. Could she save me? Of course, I could immediately disregard everything and jump out of this fire pit."

"Then, what kind of ending will that girl have?" I said in a daze.

"Yes, that is exactly the question that is tormenting me. Naturally, I can't abandon her, but will she be able to give me happiness in the future? She is an illiterate person!... I also thought about educating her, but when the two of us are in the same room, and even when we look at each other, we will be subjected to the family's, even the parents', snickers and humiliating glances; this will continue for several days, and you think I can still sit at the same desk with her and teach her to recognize the characters one by one?"

"In that case, besides your personal resistance, there is no other way? Think about it, even if you are victorious, what about her? Wouldn't she be trapped in an even deeper cellar? Don't forget, you are still a young man!"

"I am still... a young man," he said slowly, "But when you are put in this situation, what will you do?"

These words were like a piece of ice sliding down my neck and back. Yes, where is a young man not looking for opportunities to resist? Isn't he thinking of more ways than I am? A feeling of pain tightened my heart, and I couldn't help but blurt out, "This feudalism, this ritualism!"

### Beauty

— Liu Lan

This morning, the teacher who teaches selections of modern literature brought a bunch of roses and gave each person a flower, saying that May had arrived. (A foreign woman would not understand the hearts of Chinese youth.)

Roses are beautiful and fragrant, and should be given to a friend, but my flower-loving friend has gone far away.

I took it home and put it on the table, which at least added some color to this monotonous room.

When I returned at night, it had already withered. I blamed myself for my negligence. Why didn't I put it in a vase sooner? So, I quickly turned around to find a vase and fill it with water; but, you know, its beauty was gone forever.

I remembered a story written by Hawthorne.

A strange old doctor obtained half a bottle of the elixir of life and invited four old men to visit. His miraculous experiment: a broken rose, worn by him at his wedding fifty-five years ago, was placed in the elixir and restored its long-lost color and fragrance.

The old doctor also said that the elixir could also make people young again, and the four old men shared the bottle of elixir. In an instant, they all regained their youth. They cheered, they sang, they danced, they argued, and the desolate universe also became lively.

Military Preparations

### The Silent Machine Gun

— Li Yi

Two Americans, William Hale and Duran Beem, have invented a new type of silent machine gun. It resembles a handheld machine gun and can fire 10,000 bullets per minute. The gun uses air pressure rather than gunpowder, so it does not have the clattering sound of a regular machine gun. During a recent test firing, it set a three-inch-thick oak board on fire and pierced the wire mesh of an aircraft shield. When firing, the gun body remains as cold as usual, unlike the heat generated by guns that use gunpowder. The illustration shows a steel plate riddled with bullet marks from the silent machine gun.

Tiredness finally overcame the "young people," and they sat down to rest. At this moment, the rose in the old doctor's hand withered, and after a short while, the youth of the four disappeared like smoke and clouds, returning them to their twilight years.

Friends, as you can see, the beauty of the rose is fleeting, and the beauty of youth is also fleeting. But do you know that there is an eternal beauty in the world that never fades?

### Mechanized Lightning Army

— Shen Xiong

U.S. Major General Chaffee is currently planning to form a "lightning army" with swift maneuverability as a deterrent against invaders landing in North or South America. Currently, the U.S. military's response is not quick enough; for example, if the German army were to launch a surprise landing in Brazil, the U.S. military would be somewhat out of reach. But in fact, if such an event were to occur, the U.S. military must be able to quickly deploy and defeat the German army. The formation of a mechanized lightning army is intended to answer blitzkrieg with blitzkrieg.

This force consists of seven mechanized divisions, each with 10,000 officers and soldiers, 287 light tanks, 120 medium tanks, and 1,328 other vehicles, including military trucks and motorcycles. Each division has mechanized infantry, reconnaissance units, mobile artillery, and aircraft reconnaissance units. They can "march" 150 miles overnight and arrive before dawn to intercept the enemy.

The main force of the lightning army is tanks, with strong firepower. Light tanks (weighing 8 to 15 tons) are equipped with three .30 caliber machine guns and one .37 caliber cannon; 23-ton tanks are equipped with one .37 caliber cannon and six .30 caliber machine guns. It is said that by June 1941, these seven lightning divisions will be fully equipped and trained. (Note: Germany currently also has seven lightning divisions, which have been trained for six years.)

(8) Palpable Friendship

He hardly ever smiled at other children. But today was a bit strange. Whenever he mentioned Meibao, his face would reveal a kind of affectionate smile that had never been seen before. The gauntness of his face and the listlessness of his spirit were also unusual for Qiu Haitang, because these were things that had never happened before, even when he was penniless.

"Second Brother, you look like you've been sick too..."

Yu Kun gave a wry smile.

"Don't worry, I won't bother you with my troubles! But that little girl of yours has really given me a hard time! I've been running a fever for days and nights, making me more tired than singing a double bill day and night. I was the one who went outside to get the doctor, dispense medicine, and buy things. I was also the one who took turns with the nanny to hold the child at night. I, Zhao, have never done this kind of woman's work in my life!" As he said this, he took off his long gown, crossed his leg, and sat on the edge of Qiu Haitang's bed. "Good brother, can I kowtow to you? Don't ask how much I love Meibao now, but if I keep guarding her at home like this all day long, I'll be useless in a few days! So, Third Brother, I beg you to take good care of yourself and take over this burden from me as soon as possible!"

Although Yu Kun still spoke with a bit of a joking tone, Qiu Haitang, who had always known his wild-horse-like character, couldn't help but feel grateful and tearful.

"Since you were so worried, why didn't you send someone to find me?" Qiu Haitang struggled to stretch out a hand from under the thin woolen blanket and grasped Yu Kun's arm. Yu Kun immediately gently freed himself and put it back in its original place.

"I was afraid that others would find out about that place... and that they might snatch little Meibao away..."

Yu Kun took out a wrinkled and bent cigarette from his pocket, rolled it in his palm, and then looked back at his sworn brother and said:

"Second Brother, can I ring for a box of matches?"

Notes on Performers

### The Young Man Who Plays Old Men … A Special Feature on Wang Jixu …

— Zhi Yu

Those who have seen La Fei's "Home" probably still remember Wang Jixu, who played the old and frail Grandpa Gao! Look at his "old-fashioned" appearance on stage, how authentic it is! "This role must have originally been an old man, otherwise, how could he be able to act so much like one?" The audience probably thinks so! But who would know that he is just a young man in his twenties!

In today's drama and film industry, under the "spotlight above all" principle, those who are a little older will certainly not play anything other than "lead roles," and even those so-called "newcomers" who have just emerged are vying to play only "lead roles," even though their acting skills are not yet mature. Our Mr. Wang Jixu has been involved in theatrical life for a full ten years. His qualifications cannot be said to be not old. A few years ago, he even wrote, directed, and starred in "Su Wu Herding Sheep," and the results were really "not bad at all," but "once you become popular, people will be jealous of you," and he was thrown out by "those people" like that. In a fit of anger, he devoted himself to the film circle. Now, spoken drama is slowly rising again. "Real gold is not afraid of fire after all," and he was invited back to the spoken drama world.

From his name – "Jixu" – you can tell that he is a homeless wanderer. He is struggling hard in this great era. He is still studying at Great China University and teaching at a middle school at the same time. Truly, it can be said that he is so busy that he can't even catch his breath: going to university to study; going to middle school to teach; going to the movie theater to film; going to the drama theater to act; recently, he has also been writing a Qing Dynasty palace story. Therefore, "Haoli Sheng" (a type of stimulant) is being consumed bottle after bottle. He is still in an "old" tone!

"Ah! I've lost fifteen pounds recently!" he once said to me.

Finally, there is one more thing that should be mentioned. On stage, he speaks fluent Mandarin, but off stage, he is full of "ala" "ala" Ningbo dialect. When asked why he doesn't speak Mandarin, his answer is: "Ala is a Ningbo person!"

### Chronicle of a City of Sorrow

— Guo Xiao

Following "Sai Jinhua," "Under the Roofs of Shanghai," and "Wedding Night" (originally titled "One Year"), Xia Yan has a new work, "Chronicle of a City of Sorrow," being staged at the Lyceum Theatre. This play is about the failure of speculators who hoard goods to drive up prices, and it serves as a wake-up call to society. The third act, which depicts poor people lining up to buy rice, having their money stolen, and being falsely accused of being thieves and beaten by the police, is the most alarming and moving. On the one hand, the poor are starving to death, and on the other hand, the wife of a rice weevil hears about the rising price of rice and says happily, "It must rise further, it must rise further!" One really doesn't know what her intentions are.

The author's technique is excellent. For example, the aunt's mistreatment of her niece is only highlighted by trivial matters. When the uncle returns home, the niece is busy preparing water for him to wash his face; the aunt outwardly says that she feels sorry for her, but in her heart she hopes that she will be treated like this. Later, when the niece's husband returns home, he also wants to wipe his face, and while the aunt calls the maid, the niece readily rushes to fetch the water. This does not contain a single word, but it vividly portrays the aunt's discriminatory attitude towards her niece.

Shen Min's portrayal of the niece is successful. She is good at playing tragedies and always plays young, ill-fated women. Such as "Little Husband," "Shanghai Nights," "Sea Love," "Professional Women," etc., it can be said that none of them do not belong to this category. Recently, Jin Xing Film Company invited her to play Gu Xiaomei in "Tears Sprinkled on Flowers," who is also a pitiful victim. It is said that Shen Min is quiet, honest, and innocent, so she is most suitable for playing this type of role. Coupled with her serious and earnest attitude towards art, she often pretends to be true and completely forgets herself: when acting in sad scenes, she can't help but cry out from the bottom of her heart, which is also her strength.

Huang Zongjiang's He Jinfang is also extremely natural. The way he listens to the other party speak, with his head held high, complacent and smiling, is very life-like. Others include Su Dan's Zhao Fuquan, whose undershirt peeks out from his silk short shirt, looking like a businessman; You Yun's old woman, whose small feet are famous for walking; Shi Hui's Lin Mengping, worried and proud; Bai Chen's Li Yanyun, lively, humorous, optimistic, and brave; Liu Jin's Zhao Meifen, pitiful and kind: all of them can portray their respective characters, making this play a uniformly developed and well-matched performance.

The Mandarin is also above average, but sometimes it is slightly careless and the tones are wrong. For example, although the "bu" character in "xunbu" (patrolman) is in the rising tone, the pronunciation is often like the departing tone, but it is wrongly pronounced as the rising tone "pu" character. Also, for example, the "qiang" in "mianqiang" (reluctant) should be in the rising tone, but it is wrongly pronounced as the level tone "qiang" in "qiangdao" (robber).

### Silver Screen Snippets

— Qiu Wen

Li Ying made a lot of money due to the box office success of the play "Orchid of a Tragic Fate". Recently, he has been active in business. It is heard that the original site of the Lisheng Club on Yuguolu has been leased by Li Ying for a monthly rent of only 450 yuan. He plans to build a three-wheel cinema specializing in Western films on that site. It is said that the name of the cinema has been set as "King Kong," and construction is expected to begin in mid-October.

### Brief News

### An Outline of the Philosophy of Diligence

— Zong Yu

For harmony to continue, the first is to use talent appropriately. Great talents bear great responsibilities, and small talents bear small responsibilities. In a collective, there is no one who is not responsible. The second is to suit temperament. Everyone uses their strengths and avoids their weaknesses, so that everyone becomes an expert and is happy to work hard.

Chapter Nine Why Did You Come to the Ends of the Earth?

Xu Jing pointed to the sword on the wall and asked, "I just saw Brother Liu's dart skills. Brother Liu's swordsmanship must be very high. Could the Longquan on the wall be the one used by Brother Liu? Can you grant me a look?" Liu Yinyang nodded, stood up, took the sword off the wall, and handed it to Xu Jing. Xu Jing had already put his own sword aside. He drew out Liu Yinying's sword and saw that the light was like scattered lightning and the quality was like dazzling snow. It was indeed exceptionally sharp, slightly shorter than his own Chifeng sword by two or three inches. The words "White Dragon" were engraved on the hilt. He then praised, "This sword is much better! Brother Liu must use it often." Liu Yinyang smiled and said, "Since I came here a year ago, this sword has been hibernating with me in the mountains and has been of no use. Are you going to laugh at me for betraying the sword? The sword is called White Dragon and was seized from a notorious thief. There is still a page of bloody history in this." Xu Jing said, "If this sword were to fall into the hands of a thief, it would be like casting a pearl in the dark, which would be a pity. Now that it is in Brother Liu's hands, it is truly where it belongs." As he spoke, he returned the White Dragon sword to Liu Yinyang, who took it in his hand and was about to hang it back on the wall. Xu Jing wanted to see Liu Yinying's swordsmanship, so he said to Liu Yinyang, "Brother Liu's swordsmanship must be quite impressive. I would like to see Brother Liu dance." Liu Yinyang did not refuse when he heard this, and said with a smile, "I dare not disobey. But please, Xu, also dance." Xu Jing smiled and said, "My swordsmanship is extremely poor and not worth watching. Please give me some pointers." Liu Yinying smiled and said, "Don't be polite." So the two of them took their swords and walked to the courtyard outside. A crescent moon had already risen in the east, illuminating half of the courtyard like daylight. Liu Yinyang's aunt heard the noise and came out and asked, "Ying'er, why aren't you keeping your guest inside drinking wine, but you're taking your sword to the courtyard to do what?" Liu Yinyang replied, "Aunt, this Mr. Xu can dance with a sword, so I'm dancing with him for fun." Liu Yinyang's aunt smiled and said, "Ying'er is so happy that he wants to dance with a guest. He's really still a child!" She then said to Xu Jing, "Young Master Xu, my nephew is too childish, please don't laugh at him." Xu Jing said, "Brother Liu is innocent and lovely, which makes people respect him the most." Liu Yinying pulled up the front and back of his long robe and said to Xu Jing with a smile, "You are the guest and I am the host, so I should let you dance first." Xu Jing nodded and said, "The good show is in the back, and the inferior skills come first. Let me show off first, and please give me some pointers." (69)
