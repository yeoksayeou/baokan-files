### The United States Is Fully Prepared to Deal with Any Contingency in the Far East. Restrictions on Free Action Eliminated. Negotiations About to Reopen. The Choice of War or Peace Will Be Made Tomorrow

Washington, 15th (United Press) – The widespread feeling in official circles here yesterday was that President Roosevelt's order to withdraw the U.S. Marines from China was to "clear the decks" to deal with any possible emergencies in the Far East. Secretary of State Hull told reporters that this withdrawal would not affect diplomats and consular officials, who would continue to serve in various locations. Senator Connally, a Democratic Senator from Texas and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that in view of the seriousness of the situation with Japan, he could not unanimously object to allowing small detachments of U.S. Marines to remain in isolated and dangerous areas of China. Connally said, "Some foolish action by the Japanese army could cause a conflict or the possible destruction of our small detachment of Marines." Connally emphasized that he was speaking for himself and that his words were not based on any official indication of President Roosevelt's orders.

New York, 15th (Reuters) – President Roosevelt, when receiving reporters yesterday, stated that the withdrawal of small detachments of U.S. troops in China would not affect the operation of U.S. gunboats on the Yangtze River. He also said that he had no concrete plans to meet with the Japanese special envoy to the U.S., Kurusu. When asked if a Pacific war could be avoided, the President replied that he certainly hoped so, but he could not definitively answer whether or not a Pacific war could be avoided. If he answered no, those who heard him would speculate on his answer. If he answered yes, he would only be guessing. In fact, he and no one else could give a definitive answer. The President also answered a question, saying that he believed the American people were now aware of the seriousness of the Far Eastern problem.

Washington, 15th (United Press) – After announcing last night that he had ordered the withdrawal of the Marines stationed in China, President Roosevelt refused to say where the Marines would be going, nor would he comment on newspaper reports that the move was a warning to Japan. He also said that he did not know whether the withdrawal of the Marines would affect the status of the Shanghai International Settlement, pointing out that many powers had interests in Shanghai, not just the United States.

Chongqing, 15th (Reuters) – Chinese newspapers here unanimously stated that the passage of the Neutrality Act Amendment by the U.S. House of Representatives allows the U.S. government to act freely in future negotiations with Japan. Therefore, Japan is directly affected by this move. "Central Daily News" editorial this morning said that Tojo's decision to send Kurusu to Washington was mainly aimed at delaying the explosion in the Pacific, so that Japan would have more time to engage in military preparations. The plan Kurusu is carrying and what Nomura has already proposed will certainly not be fundamentally different. Even if there are differences, they are probably formal rather than substantial. On the eve of Kurusu's arrival in the United States, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Neutrality Act Amendment, which is an indirect warning to Kurusu that the United States is not only determined to resist continued provocations, but is also prepared to act. The United States is now not only militarily prepared, but also legally prepared, because all legal restrictions on free action in the United States have now been completely eliminated. The amendment to Articles 2 and 6 of the Neutrality Act is a necessary procedure for the United States to take proactive action. The United States has in fact long gone beyond the spirit of the Neutrality Act. The amendment only gives the United States the right to act freely. The Japanese Diet is scheduled to open today. It is impossible to predict what method it will take to deal with the new activities of the United States. However, in any case, the United States has preempted. The development of the Far East will follow the path of natural selection, which is now inevitable.

Tokyo, 15th (United Press) – Japanese authorities today refused to criticize the withdrawal of U.S. Marines from China, simply stating, "The actions of the Marines are a matter for the U.S. government itself." The representative spokesperson of the Cabinet Information Bureau recalled that he had made a statement last Tuesday, saying that he was not surprised by President Roosevelt's announcement that he was considering withdrawing the Marines. At the time, Ishii also said, "He believes that this move is beneficial to China." However, opinions published in Tokyo newspapers all believed that the withdrawal indicated that the United States could take free action in the event of the worst possible relationship with Japan.

Nazi Germany Frequently Exerts Pressure on Japan, While Britain and the United States Remain Steadfast

Washington, 15th (International News Service) – According to information received by the U.S. government, Berlin has reportedly informed Japan not to be afraid because the U.S. has gained the upper hand in the Atlantic. Japanese special envoy Kurusu has now arrived in the U.S. to assist Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Nomura in talks with the State Department. It is widely believed that Kurusu's efforts may be greatly undermined by this move by Berlin. Diplomatic sources clearly indicate that Berlin is currently putting great pressure on Tokyo to increase tensions in the Pacific and prevent the transport of U.S. supplies to the Middle East for delivery to British and Soviet troops. In order to resist this pressure, London is now warning Japan that it is extremely dangerous to fight with Western powers in the Pacific. Prime Minister Churchill's recent remarks, stating that if war breaks out in the Far East, Britain will support the United States, and Washington's decision to withdraw the Fourth Marine Regiment from China, are all intended to convince Tokyo that Western countries are prepared to meet any challenge. Officials here generally believe that the only hope of avoiding war with Japan lies in making Japan understand that the U.S. is prepared to fight in the Pacific if necessary. If Tokyo can understand that the U.S. is prepared to use force if American interests in the Pacific are further threatened, then Washington believes that there may be an opportunity to reach an understanding with Japan. According to qualified opinions, the indecisiveness of the United States is the main reason for restraining Japan. Since the passage of the amendment to the Neutrality Act, the situation has changed again. The passage of the bill is a victory for President Roosevelt's foreign policy. It is expected that this move will make a profound impression on Tokyo. This matter can prove that the U.S.'s determination to continue resisting aggression has never wavered.

Batavia, 15th (Reuters) – Official circles here have not heard of the alleged transfer of the German battleship "Admiral Scheer" to the Pacific.

Philippine President Quezon's Speech: Sharing Fortunes and Misfortunes with the United States

We will defend this remote border of American freedom with everything and maintain the glory of the United States undiminished. We vow to assist the United States with all our efforts and sacrifices. Quezon also said that he had received a letter from President Roosevelt expressing satisfaction with the defense preparations of the Philippines, and said that the American people's belief that the Philippines can be defended is growing day by day. Quezon finally urged the Filipino people to engage in training to prepare for emergencies, saying that we must unite all of our troops, wealth, resources, and manpower so that the Philippines can achieve strength in defense and work together with the United States.

Large Numbers of Japanese Residents in Malaya Expelled, Indicating a Tough British Stance

London, 15th (United Press) – Informed sources here said yesterday that on the eve of Kurusu's arrival in Washington, new reports were received that Japanese residents in Malaya were being expelled, which indicates that Britain continues to take a tough stance against Japan. Authorities have not confirmed reports of Japanese residents being expelled from Kelantan, but said that this is very likely. Although they did not confirm that hundreds of Japanese residents had withdrawn from Kelantan, Malaya, due to British decrees, it is said that some Japanese residents withdrew from Malaya because the freezing order caused their businesses to stagnate.

### Japanese Special Envoy Kurusu Expected to Arrive in Washington Today, Widely Believed to Be Carrying Five Proposals

Washington, 15th (United Press) – Japanese special envoy Kurusu is expected to arrive here from San Francisco this morning and is expected to begin talks with Secretary of State Hull on Monday. Observers said that President Roosevelt's postponement of his trip to Warm Springs until Monday was of great significance. However, they believe that the President will not meet with the Japanese special envoy because the ceremony for him to sign the Neutrality Act Amendment will take up all his time until he leaves. It is said that even if Kurusu can meet with the President, it will only be a formal courtesy visit.

Beijing, 15th (United Press) – Well-informed Japanese sources here unanimously believe that Kurusu is carrying five proposals to Washington to resolve the Pacific peace issue. The five proposals are as follows: 1. The Chinese government recognizes Manchukuo. 2. Japanese troops withdraw from China, but remain stationed in Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Qingdao or Yantai. 3. Japan promises to give up southward expansion, but economic expansion is excluded. 4. Japan continues to economically control the five provinces of North China. 5. Japan will abandon its intention to invade Siberia.

### Amidst Tensions in the International Situation, the Japanese Diet Opens Today, Supplementing War Funds by 3.8 Billion Yen

The Government Will Urge the Diet to Pass It Quickly

Tokyo, 15th (United Press) – Both houses of the Japanese Diet convened this morning. Informed sources said that the Lower House will quickly pass the government's request for an additional 3,800,000,000 yen in special military expenses on Monday due to the current situation and the government's urgent needs. The bill will then be sent to the House of Peers. Japanese newspapers said that this special session is the most important in Japanese history, because its purpose is to break the unprecedented crisis that Japan is facing. The extreme nationalist "Hochi Shimbun" commented, "The international situation around Japan has indeed become increasingly serious. The alliance between Britain and the United States has taken all possible steps to threaten and oppress Japan, not only using economic methods, but also using political and military methods." Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Togo, and Finance Minister Kaya will all deliver speeches on Monday morning, after which the real business meeting will begin. Members of the majority party in the Lower House have decided that there will only be one question on the government's speech, so that business can be handled quickly. Former Railway Minister Ogawa has been selected as the questioner. Both houses are engaged in organizing committees today. The official Diet session will open on Sunday morning, when both houses will hold a joint meeting in the House of Peers, and the Emperor will attend and deliver a speech.

Tokyo, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – The Japanese cabinet passed a supplementary wartime budget of 3.8 billion yen at a meeting on Friday, most of which will be raised through the issuance of public bonds.

### Japan Actively Prepares for War, Revises Military Service Regulations, Those Exempted from Military Service Must Be Re-examined

And Decided to Increase the Number of Korean Volunteers

Tokyo, 15th (Reuters) – The Japanese cabinet's decision to increase expenditure by 2.1 times and the decision of the Ministry of the Army to convene a re-examination of those exempted from military service in the last ten years show that Japan is now rapidly preparing to accept the verbal challenges issued by the leaders of the British and American governments. At the same time, the Japanese authorities have also decided to increase the number of Korean volunteers and apply the new indirect tax to overseas regions. The outcome of Kurusu's mission to the United States and the development of next week's Diet are still uncertain, so Japan's future actions cannot be determined. However, on the surface, even if Japan is unwilling, it is preparing to proceed and expects to extend the limits of its so-called fixed policy. The amended conscription ordinance announced yesterday stipulates that those who have been deemed physically unfit and exempted from military service since 1931 must be re-examined, and reserve officers under the age of 40 and reserve officers under the age of 50 who have not been enlisted must be called up for enlistment. This revised ordinance will be implemented from today after being approved by the Emperor. Furthermore, Japanese residents residing in China, Hong Kong, and Macau will no longer be exempt from military service.

### Thailand Has the Determination to Defend Itself, the Supreme Headquarters Has Been Established, Please the People Rise Up to Defend the Motherland, Strictly Prevent Fifth Column Conspiracies from Sabotaging

Bangkok, 15th (Reuters) – The Supreme Command of National Defense has been established, with the Prime Minister serving as the Supreme Commander and the Minister of National Defense as the deputy. According to a Thai cabinet member who spoke to a Reuters reporter, the significance of this move may not mean that Thailand's diplomatic relations have had any serious developments in the nearest future, but it does indicate that our national defense structure has reached the highest level of preparation, so that we will not be at a loss in the event of any sudden attack. Last night, a commentator on Bangkok's official wireless electricity station said that Thailand had never deceived Japan, and expressed approval of the Thai Prime Minister's frank denial of the Tokyo newspapers' claim that Thailand was not grateful to Japan but had turned against Japan and become pro-British, saying that the Thai people were very surprised by this absurd propaganda from the Japanese side. Last night, the Thai wireless station warned the Thai people to be careful of the activities of some foreigners who were spies and fifth columnists and spread seeds of discord, and it should be known that foreigners even attempted to put forward names, saying that they were more capable of performing their duties than the current Prime Minister, and warned against foreign agencies trying to rent houses near various public offices and important transportation centers, and preparing to engage in sabotage when the time was ripe. Foreigners have also tried to obtain the help of officials through bribery and other methods of enticement, but these officials have quickly reported to the government. The commentator also said that the fifth columnists are planning to seize various important transportation facilities, such as postal telegrams, wireless stations, water plants, and power plants. All the people of the country should rise up to defend the motherland.

### If Japanese Troops Invade the Burma Road, They Will Encounter Extremely Strong Obstacles. 300,000 Chinese Troops Destroying Vietnamese Transportation Lines. Britain and the United States Indicate That They Will Take Severe Steps Against Japan.

New York – According to Mr. Hallman, an American highway expert who assisted Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in reorganizing the transportation work on the Burma Road, if Japanese troops take any action against the highway, they will encounter "extremely strong obstacles." Mr. Hallman said, "The Japanese troops must pass through dangerous mountain cities, which can be used by the Chinese as the most convenient defensive weapons." He declined to mention China's defense plans, but said that any attempt to cut off the road would pay a "huge price." He also said that there are currently hundreds of trucks on the highway and that the number will increase to 10,000 in the coming months after receiving American aid. Mr. Hallman also said that the 100-mile section of the road at the starting point has been paved with asphalt, and that there is enough material to pave the entire road. "But even without this solid road-building material, the road is good enough to be an excellent highway." He also said that after using the American highway method, the journey on the road has been reduced from nine days to six days. (United Press, 15th)

Chongqing – The Chongqing Army's "Sweeping News" newspaper announced today that Britain and the United States have jointly agreed with China that if Japan attempts to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road, Britain and the United States will assist in defending the road. The newspaper said, "We want to especially point out to the army and the people of the whole country that the assistance of Britain and the United States in defending the Yunnan-Burma Road is only one point that can be announced at present in the agreement between China, Britain, and the United States. Britain and the United States have assured us that if Japan attempts to occupy any section of the Yunnan-Burma Road, Britain and the United States will take severe steps." At the same time, it is learned that when the ten major cultural organizations entertained diplomatic personnel from Britain, the United States, Belgium, and the Soviet Union on Wednesday night, they displayed a slogan saying, "We need the ABCD countries to conclude an alliance." An English newspaper editorial said, "If Japan attacks the Yunnan-Burma Road, it will not only have to fight with the Chinese army, but also directly or indirectly with Britain and the United States." (Haye Telegraph, 15th)

Hanoi – A United Press reporter recently inspected the Yunnan border and saw no signs of Japanese troops concentrating in the vicinity. The reporter returned here yesterday. At the same time, reliable sources denied that Japan was making further demands on French Indochina. Since the arrival of the new Japanese ambassador, Yoshizawa, there has been no activity other than welcoming him. Mr. Yoshizawa is now waiting for the Governor-General of Vietnam, General Decoux, to come here before starting talks. Informed sources said that there is absolutely no basis for the rumors that the Japanese army is making frequent movements and that the Japanese army is currently training Annamese soldiers for use. (United Telegraph, 15th)

Rangoon – Dr. Young, a representative of the American National Broadcasting Company who came to the Far East with the British army, told a Reuters reporter last night that if the Japanese side invaded the Yunnan border from Vietnam, the Japanese authorities would encounter unexpected events. Yunnan Province currently has 300,000 Chinese troops, and in the past two weeks, it has bombed caves and bridges, destroying transportation between Yunnan and Vietnam. If the Japanese army invades Thailand and Britain declares war on Japan as a result, the United States will declare war on Japan within two weeks. The cooperation between the British and American armies in the Far East is now complete, and their combined strength is sufficient to meet any challenge. He knew for sure that if Japan challenged the British government or the Dutch East Indies government, the United States would not stand by and would automatically join the battle. (Reuters, 15th)

New York – The National Wireless Electricity Company heard a telegram from Saigon yesterday that two regiments of elite Japanese troops had landed in Hainan. The wireless electricity also said that Japan is continuing to increase its military strength in Vietnam. (United Press, 15th)

Hanoi – I recently revisited the Yunnan-Burma border. This time, I paid the most attention to the Lao Cai area. After my investigation, I felt that an attack on Yunnan Province at present is not only absolutely unlikely, but also impossible in essence, because the terrain is dangerous and there are no convenient transportation facilities. The Lao Cai area is a wild place with towering mountains and dense forests. The only transportation between Hanoi and Lao Cai is the narrow gauge of the former Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which is winding and tortuous. Even the fastest train takes eleven hours to travel only 300 kilometers. There are absolutely no signs of military transportation at present. A bridge connecting the river to China has been blown up by the Chinese side. Wild grass grows on both sides of the roadbed, and the rails have long been removed, extending over 200 kilometers. The second road starting from Hanoi must be detoured through Ha Giang. The road is tortuous and cannot carry heavy loads. Unlike what is reported outside, only a few Japanese soldiers are stationed at the points I inspected. Based on my experience in the entire border area, I now believe that the Japanese side does not want to take this risk. As for the west connecting Kunming and Burma, it is a barren land with overlapping mountains and no roads to follow. It is impossible to reach the current sparsely scattered French military outposts without traveling for several weeks. (Special Correspondent of Reuters on the 5th)

Cooperation Between China and the United States on Health Matters

Kunming – Since the arrival of the American Anti-Malaria Team in China, the health work on the Yunnan-Burma Railway has adopted a comprehensive cooperation method between Chinese and American businesses.

At present, the Health Department has more than 300 medical and nursing personnel who are actively engaged in various health work on the entire line. As for medical supplies and equipment, the United States has promised a large amount of assistance. It is estimated that within this month, 12 sets of 25-bed clinic equipment, 60 sets of emergency mobile clinic equipment, and 1 set of 250-bed hospital equipment will be shipped from the United States to China. In the spring of next year, items for hospitals with 2,000 beds will also be shipped.

### Vice Minister of Finance Gu Qun Returns to Chongqing from Hong Kong

The arrival of Foxhall and the reduction of funds between Shanghai and Chongqing both prove this trend. Regarding the methods by which the British and American governments assist the Chinese government in controlling the foreign exchange obtained by exporters in China, this place is extremely satisfied.

### Outline of the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System

Chongqing, The revised outline of the financial revenue and expenditure system was officially promulgated by the National Government on November 8. The original text is as follows: The national financial revenue and expenditure is divided into two systems: national finance and autonomous finance (the classification is based on the provisions in the attached table). National finance includes all income and expenditure originally belonging to the state, provinces, and administrative municipalities (excluding autonomous financial revenue and expenditure). Autonomous finance takes cities and counties as units and includes all income and expenditure of cities, counties, townships, and towns. The allocation of national tax revenue to cities and counties is based on the following standards: 1. Stamp tax: 30% of the net income is allocated to cities and counties. 2. Inheritance tax: 15% of the net income is allocated to cities and counties. 3. Business tax: 30% to 50% of the net income is allocated to cities and counties. 4. Land tax (before the implementation of the Land Law, it is still the land tax. The part of the original provincial income belongs to the central government, and the part of the original income of cities and counties remains the same for the time being, but during the period of collecting in kind, all in-kind belongs to the central government, and the part of the original income of cities and counties will be allocated by the central government with reference to the original income amount. 5. Deed tax: the part of the original provincial income belongs to the central government, and the part of the original income of cities and counties remains the same for the time being. 6. Slaughter tax: it is carved out of the business tax, and the full amount belongs to cities and counties. All income tax belongs to the central government. Subsidies to cities and counties are approved and allocated by the central government.

Editorial

### Comparison of the Two Major International Camps

Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war in June, the two major international camps have become more clearly divided. For the past five months, this division has continued to develop. Although neither side has had any new gains or losses, there have been absolutely different growths and declines within the original lineup of both sides. In other words, on the side of the democratic front, due to the increasingly stronger fighting of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and the increasingly active assistance from the United States, not only has the unity between each other become closer, but the sum of their strengths has also obviously increased compared to before. On the contrary, on the side of the aggressive front, due to Germany's entanglement in the war against the Soviet Union, and Japan's gradual encirclement in the Western Pacific, not only has the consumption of individual strengths increased day by day, but the situation of their mutual collusion has also remained in the stage of seeming harmony but actual divergence.

As far as the democratic group is concerned, from the Churchill-Roosevelt meeting, through the convening of the Moscow Three-Nation Conference and the conclusion of the alliance between Britain and the Soviet Union, all the way to the passage of the Neutrality Act amendment by the US Congress the day before yesterday, it is believable that Britain and the United States are sparing no expense to assist the Soviet Union in continuing its resistance. At the same time, Britain is of course stepping up its efforts and is constantly preparing for its own counterattack against the Axis powers. This refers to the European part. As for the Far East, the establishment of the ABCD united front has long been recognized by the world. Looking at the recent active assistance from the United States to China on the one hand, and the adoption of a tough stance towards Japan on the other hand, as well as British Prime Minister Churchill's announcement that Britain is prepared to declare war on Japan within one hour after the outbreak of war between the United States and Japan, it can be seen that Britain and the United States do have a common determination and preparation to assist China and contain Japan's further aggression at any time. The united relationship between China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has developed to the point where they share weal and woe and have no way to retreat, as described above. If we further examine their individual strengths, it will be even more exciting. Because China and Britain have had an excellent opportunity for the Soviet Union to resist the war, they have actively supplemented their own national defense institutions and adjusted the military industry of the empire in the past five months. China has fully demonstrated its strength through the great war results of the recent battles of Changsha, Yichang, and Zhengzhou. Although the Soviet Union suffered from fighting alone and the inferiority of military equipment in the war against Germany, it can be said that it has laid the foundation for the final victory in terms of its glorious war record and the aroused national spirit in the past five months. The recent successful counterattack on the Moscow front and the invincibility of the South Caucasus front further indicate that its resistance will increase day by day with the active assistance of Britain and the United States. In addition, the United States, as a great arsenal of the democratic front, is not only rich in materials and sufficient in military resources, but also has a great potential due to the gradual trend of American public opinion towards participation in the war and the rapid development of the national army, navy, and air force.

On the contrary, the aggressive group presents a contrasting picture to the situation of the democratic countries: First, in terms of mutual relations, although there is a need to strengthen collusion between Germany and Japan, they are still only in a situation of mutual deception and mutual use; First, in terms of individual strength, Italy's decline to a second- or third-rate country is not worth mentioning. Although the Nazi war machine is still powerful, in view of the huge consumption of the recent five months of war against the Soviet Union and the hardship and inconvenience imposed on the entire Europe by the British blockade policy, the replenishment of gasoline, food, and other raw materials required by Germany in the future has become a serious problem. As for the source of troops, although there are still ways to remedy it compared to the past, the replenishment of air force personnel does not seem to be able to keep up with the huge losses currently in the Soviet war. As for Japan, after four years of war against China, the strength has been consumed by more than half, and it has also encountered the economic blockade of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. Although there are residual materials in the occupied areas of China that can be plundered, it is ultimately difficult to offset the losses caused by the exhaustion of the foreign market. Therefore, the increasing depletion of its strength is inevitable.

In summary, it can be seen that the weight of the democratic front will only increase day by day in the future, and the unity between each other will only increase day by day. In this aggressive front, not only is there a sense of exhaustion in terms of strength, but also in terms of mutual relations, it is feared that it will be difficult to avoid the criticism of having different dreams in the same bed and being impermanent in conclusion and dispersal. This is why Germany is eager for Japan to act, but Japan is still reluctant to give up negotiations with the United States. However, before Kurusu arrived in Washington, the United States announced the withdrawal of the Marines stationed in China on the one hand, and amended the Neutrality Act on the other hand. At the same time, its military delegation in China is more actively assisting the Chinese government in enriching the southwest defense and preparing to resist future offensives. From this, it can be seen that the US position is extremely firm. Unless Japan truly changes its course, I am afraid that the so-called negotiations will ultimately be in vain. Under this situation, will Japan be loyal to the Axis powers and take risks? Or will it disregard the interests of its allies and take care of itself? This is not only related to the peace and war in the Far East, but also enough to affect the rise and fall of the two major international camps. Where Japan goes, it will be known within this year.

### Fierce Battle on the Moscow Front; Soviets Gain the Initiative; Germany Eager to Seize the Caucasus Oil Fields; All Efforts to Attack Kerch Encounter Strong Resistance

Reuters, London, 15th: The twenty-first week of the German-Soviet war has come to an end. The war in various parts of the front is still fierce. The German army is now attacking Moscow, Sevastopol, and Kerch-Kalinin to Tula with all its strength. The two armies are now fighting fiercely in the cold weather, especially near Volokolamsk, 70 miles northwest of the Soviet capital, and Narofominsk, 40 miles south of the Soviet capital. The German army seems eager to seize the Caucasus oil fields and can no longer bear to wait. Therefore, it is now doing everything in its power to break through the strong resistance of the Soviet army in Kerch. However, whether it can succeed is still unknown, because the Soviet army has no sign of giving up its solid defense of the area and will defend this fortress to protect the gateway to the Caucasus. According to a report from the Swedish capital Svenska Dagbladet's correspondent in Germany, the German side now intends to occupy it before the allied forces arrive in the Caucasus to deploy their defenses. According to news received in the Swedish capital, everything in the Donets Basin seems to be peaceful, but the Soviet army around Moscow is extremely active. It is reported that in addition to repeated counterattacks in the central route, the Soviet army also sent paratroopers to land behind the German army on the northern front. These paratroopers include specialized technical personnel to cut telephone lines and carry out other sabotage work. On the northern route, there are fierce battles south of Kashumaqi. It is reported that Finnish snowmobile troops have invaded the east north of the area and cut off the Murmansk railway south of Sologa.

Reuters, London, 15th: A Reuters military correspondent said that although neither side of the Soviet-German war has reported any major developments in any area of the front, this does not mean that the war has slackened. From the phenomenon, the Soviet army has gradually gained the initiative. It has gained advantages in the Moscow front, Leningrad, and Murmansk areas. Only in the Crimean Peninsula does the German army still seem to be launching offensive operations against Kerch and other places. The German side claims that Kerch is now within range of artillery fire, but does not specify whether it is long-range artillery or short-range howitzers. In any case, the German army has not yet broken through its outer defenses. Even if it can capture the city in the future, it will find it difficult to fly over the strait to the east of the city. Regarding the Moscow front, according to unofficial news yesterday, the Soviet army has driven the enemy out of 20 villages in the Kalinin area. The German army in the Tula area also suffered heavy losses and was driven out of several villages. The German army in Maloyaroslavets has now been driven across the river and retreated after bloody battles on the Nara River in the past two weeks. These news descriptions are very detailed and should not be unfounded. The fact that the German side still does not mention a word about the central front can further prove the reliability of this news. Neutral sources have reported news authorized by the German side, mentioning the muddy roads, severe weather, and many difficulties in the war zone, and saying that the German army is now preparing to launch a final attack on the Moscow defense line with all its strength. If the German military headquarters really has this plan, it obviously should not publicize it. It is likely that the German army is retreating, so it wants to bluff and make the Soviet side mistakenly believe that the German army is preparing to attack. The supply problem is quite serious. Tanks traveling in the mud require three times more gasoline than usual, which is difficult to maintain. It is expected that the current stalemate will change soon.

The Red Army's 15th Division Assembles Strong Positions in Outer Mongolia and the Caucasus

Havas, Tokyo, the 10th: "Daily News" recently carried a special report stating that according to reliable sources, the Red Army is actively increasing its defenses in Outer Mongolia. There are about 15 divisions of the Red Army there, and fresh troops are arriving continuously. The term of military service has also been extended to five years, and defenses are being built on the southern border for alert. The elite Mongolian cavalry has been transferred to the Eastern Front in Europe to fight.

Havas Agency, London, 14th: According to Soviet line news, the Red Army has already deployed strong positions in the Caucasus to await the German army's invasion from the Kerch Strait and repel it. The Red Army was originally concentrated in the Rostov area of the Don River Basin to block the German army's invasion of the Caucasus along the Don River. Now, a part of it has been transferred from the city to the Caucasus to reinforce.

### In the Western Mediterranean, Germany Claims Naval Victory; British Aircraft Carrier Lost, Four Main Ships Damaged; Battleship Malaya Attacked and Heavily Damaged

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 15th: The Führer's headquarters issued a special communique at noon on Saturday as follows: The German Navy has achieved another amazing victory. In the western Mediterranean, a German submarine suddenly attacked a British warship team. The submarine led by Deputy Commander Reischke sank the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal". At the same time, the submarine led by Deputy Commander Gorgenberg heavily damaged the British battleship "Malaya" (31,100 tons). After the ship was injured, it was towed to the port of Gibraltar. Several other British ships were also hit by torpedoes.

Reuters, London, 15th: A Navy Department communique declared that it has been ascertained that only eighteen people are missing from the "Ark Royal", but some of them may be on ships that have not yet returned to their base. There are no dead or injured among the ship's officers. The ship has a crew of about 1,600 people.

United Press, La Linea, 15th: Yesterday, sources here confirmed that the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" was sunk 100 miles east of Gibraltar off Malaga. Unconfirmed news from Spain said that the 27,000-ton warship was sunk by a German submarine, killing 60 soldiers and injuring 100. A United Press source here confirmed that several aircraft on the "Ark Royal" were able to take off and land in Gibraltar. The "Ark Royal" is one of the most heavily crewed ships in the British Navy, with approximately 1,600 men and normally carrying 60 to 70 aircraft. (The Admiralty in London has published details of the ship's sinking, but the reported news is that many crew members have been rescued.) Authoritative sources in London said that the ship was returning to Gibraltar when it was attacked, not during combat. Sources said that the attacker may have been an Italian submarine.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 15th: The aircraft carrier "Ark Royal", which the British Admiralty announced as sunk, is the fourth warship of its kind lost by Britain. The first was the "Courageous", which was sunk by a German submarine in September 1939. Its sister ship, the "Glorious", was sunk in a naval battle near Norway in June 1940. The third was the aircraft carrier "Hermes", which is currently being repaired in a shipyard in the United States. The ship was heavily damaged during a German air raid on the port of Lavalanetta in Malta, and was sailed from there to Cairo, through the Red Sea, to the United States. The "Ark Royal" was launched in April 1937 and took two and a half years to build. It can carry more aircraft than British ships of the same type and has the strongest replenishment.

### Funeral for Deceased French General

It will pass through the Belgian capital, Cologne in France, Linz in Austria, and terminate at Kandam port in Turkey. Furthermore, branch roads are planned, one leading to Sofia and another to Bucharest.

### Litvinov Arrives in Baku

United Press, London, 15th - The intelligence department announced yesterday that the new Soviet ambassador to Washington, Litvinov, and the American ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, have safely arrived in Baku. Their plane was several days overdue in Tehran.

### Admiral Yarnell's Orders Arrive in Shanghai, U.S. Military Withdrawal Imminent, Fourth Marine Regiment Fully Prepared for Departure, Camp Furnishings Sold and Destroyed Separately, Yangtze River Fleet to Remain Stationed

The order for the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai to prepare for withdrawal was reported in this newspaper on the 9th. The night before last, U.S. President Roosevelt issued the final order for withdrawal. Yesterday, the U.S. Navy press release stated, "President Roosevelt has ordered the withdrawal of the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Peiping. All necessary measures have been completed, and the withdrawal is about to begin." As a result, the situation in the city has suddenly become tense. This newspaper's reporter visited the U.S. military headquarters in Shanghai at the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Xiaosha Du Road around 5:00 PM yesterday. It was confirmed that the auctioned items were heavy tables, chairs, and other equipment that were difficult to transport. The rumors of selling canned food and drinks were inaccurate. Today is Sunday, and it is yet to be determined whether the auction will continue. When asked about a specific date for the withdrawal from Shanghai, the response was that no official date has been set. The withdrawal will take place after the troops from Peiping and Tianjin arrive in Shanghai and depart together. The internal situation of the regiment is calm, soldiers are going out for leisure, and everything is normal, with no state of panic.

Withdrawal Preparations Completed

After receiving the order from the U.S. Navy to prepare for withdrawal, the U.S. Navy authorities in Shanghai, the Fourth Regiment immediately began preparations. All documents, files, military equipment, and luggage were prepared. All bank deposits of soldiers and officers have also been withdrawn as per the U.S. Navy authorities' instructions. Most of the smaller accounts with local businesses have also been settled. Yesterday morning, the U.S. Navy authorities in Shanghai officially announced all the necessary preparations for the withdrawal. Therefore, they are now fully prepared to depart and are awaiting the arrival of ships from the U.S. Navy in Shanghai to board and leave Shanghai at any time. It is rumored that it will be sometime between next Monday and next Friday. According to informed sources, the Marine Corps will leave Shanghai no later than next week. The small number of American defense forces in Peiping and Tianjin are already en route to Shanghai to await ships to travel together. Ten American Marines had been stationed at the Yangshupu Power Plant for security purposes, and they will soon be withdrawn to the main unit. Regarding the withdrawal of the Marines, it is rumored that 300 troops will be ordered by the U.S. Navy authorities in the next two or three days to sail to Shanghai on American merchant ships from Singapore. The remaining 600 troops will be withdrawn later.

Yangtze River Fleet to Remain

According to reliable sources close to diplomatic circles, in this tense situation, the British and American authorities in Shanghai will also step up efforts to persuade their citizens to evacuate. All British ships sailing the Southeast Asian routes will be required to reserve some cabin space for the evacuation of British and American citizens. However, U.S. diplomats and the highest-ranking U.S. Navy officer in Shanghai, Rear Admiral Glassford, and the Luzon and other Yangtze gunboats under his command, will continue to be stationed here unless absolutely necessary.

Justification for Military Preparations

President Roosevelt believes that U.S.-Japan relations are becoming increasingly dangerous and that war in the Pacific is imminent. He is actively taking various preparatory measures to be able to deal with the situation calmly. Evacuating Americans from the Far East has been underway for some time, and the other day he announced the decision to withdraw the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China to prevent them from being trapped by the enemy in the event of a sudden war. The U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China only consists of 750 personnel in Shanghai, 165 in Peiping, and 50 in Tianjin.

Few Against Many

This shows that the U.S. attitude towards Japan has reached an extremely tough level. According to information obtained from reliable sources by this reporter, the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment in Shanghai has received orders to be ready to depart within 24 hours. Therefore, the American soldiers are packing their luggage and are extremely busy. Personal cars and belongings of officers and soldiers that cannot be taken away are either given to friends or sold at auction. However, the auction houses do not publicly declare them as belonging to the U.S. military. Military trucks and other equipment belonging to the army are, according to

Military Law

not allowed to be sold. Therefore, they can only be transported away, or their engines removed and transported, and the bodies destroyed. In short, the withdrawal of the U.S. military is only a matter of time. Many Russian and Korean women in Shanghai, and bars, rely on American soldiers for a living. Hearing that the U.S. military is about to withdraw, they will inevitably be extremely depressed. According to observers, the Pacific War is a naval war, and victory or defeat depends on the sea, not on land. If the U.S. Marine Corps remains stationed in Shanghai, Peiping, and Tianjin, it will be useless in the event of a major war and will only suffer sacrifices. Therefore, there is a

necessary to withdraw. When the U.S. President announced last week that he was considering withdrawing U.S. troops from China, it was initially reported that the Japanese side viewed this move as a concession by the United States to Japan, as the Japanese side initially wanted U.S. troops to withdraw from China. However, Japanese newspapers, such as the Japanese-language "Continental News" in Shanghai, all published editorials criticizing President Roosevelt for "rashly" announcing his intention to withdraw U.S. troops at a time when the U.S. and Japan were trying to maintain peace in the Pacific, hurting Japanese feelings and bringing the U.S. and Japan closer to armed conflict. Their state of anxiety is evident in their words, knowing that if the U.S. and Japan go to war, they will inevitably face the combined front of the ABCD powers alone, and the outcome is related to the rise and fall of Japan, so war cannot be lightly initiated.

Troop Transport En Route to Shanghai

The U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai, numbering 750 personnel, has received the official order from Admiral Yarnell, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, and is currently ending its 14-year history in Shanghai in preparation for departure. Listeners of local radio received a broadcast from Old Lyme yesterday morning that a President Liner ship is currently en route to Shanghai and will withdraw the U.S. troops of the Fourth Regiment before Friday. It has been confirmed that the U.S. military will soon withdraw from China, as announced by President Roosevelt. Various parties in the city immediately experienced

Significant Reactions

The black market exchange rate for the U.S. dollar has shrunk from 40 yuan to 30 yuan, and continued to fall yesterday morning. An official from the British Consulate said that the registration work for the evacuation of British citizens has been intensified in the past two days. The American President Lines Company here expects that many American citizens will rush to buy tickets on Monday. However, representatives of the American and British communities in Shanghai stated that the U.S. military withdrawal does not in itself imply a deterioration of the situation in the Pacific. This move by the United States only confirms a long-evident fact, that the United States will not make concessions to Japan on any fundamental points, and is currently

clearing the deck

in preparation for war. Whether or not war will break out depends on whether Japan is willing to surrender or stop its expansionist ambitions. There is no sign of anxiety among the American and British communities. The heads of American trading firms interviewed by reporters said that they intend to continue operating to the greatest extent possible, and that rumors that American trading firms are about to close down are completely unfounded. Americans have invested a total of 200 million U.S. dollars here, and they will not end it immediately. American and British observers also doubt that there will be a large-scale evacuation of British and American citizens. One American said, "I think most of the expatriates who are still in Shanghai still

intend to stay here

and not leave." Reporters recently sought opinions from major merchants, who reiterated their belief that U.S.-Japan talks in Washington may be able to find a way to maintain peace. It is said that Japan will not risk going to war with the United States, so it is expected that the U.S. and Japan will reach an agreement, in fact or in meaning, to keep the situation in the Pacific in its current unstable state. However, since the situation is unstable, the expatriates in Shanghai are sitting on a powder keg. If there are any unforeseen developments, this powder keg will explode into the sky. Such developments are

the German army wins a great victory

or the Japanese army takes explosive action. The former may not happen, but the latter may happen when the Japanese military suddenly takes action in this psychological war.

Various Parties Sense Great Difficulty Ahead

Japanese officials are silent on this situation. A Japanese naval spokesman only said that he had expected the U.S. military to withdraw, while a Japanese army spokesman said that he could not comment, as this was the "internal affairs" of the U.S. authorities. According to Russians, White Russian expatriates heard that the U.S. military was withdrawing, it was as if "great difficulty was at hand." Many White Russian bar girls and dancers rely on American soldiers for their main income, and will now suffer a major economic blow. Stores and restaurants in the Avenue Joffre area, among other locations, are also frequently patronized by American soldiers. In addition, Russians also share the same view as British and American expatriates, that the U.S. military withdrawal is Washington's

Final Notice

Russians do not believe that the withdrawal of U.S. troops is a definite step towards war, but they believe that this move, by making Tokyo fully aware of the American position, may improve the situation in the Pacific. Judges in the courts of the International Settlement remain silent on the U.S. military withdrawal, although they acknowledge that the situation is currently quite tense. Chinese bankers believe that the U.S. military withdrawal will make speculation and profiteering impossible, as most speculate in foreign stocks, the black market for foreign exchange, and imported goods. At the same time, U.S. consular officials stated that they had not received any further instructions from Washington regarding the evacuation of American civilians. The most recent instructions were to clarify that the previously issued evacuation advisory remained in effect. The previous evacuation order applied specifically to American women, children, and non-essential men. American President Lines said that, so far, there has been no stampede of American citizens to book tickets. The words of an American businessman who has lived in Shanghai for a long time best represent the general opinion of the American and British communities. He said, "I personally do not believe that the U.S. and Japan will go to war, but I also acknowledge that there is a possibility of war. The withdrawal of U.S. troops has not made the situation worse. Of course, having U.S. troops in Shanghai makes us feel

affection

and we don't want to see them leave. However, the strength of the U.S. military in Shanghai is very weak. Now that the U.S. military has cleared the deck for war, the U.S. Marine Corps must leave. I have not seen a large-scale evacuation trend among the American and British communities. Those of us who remain in Shanghai must keep a clear head and continue to operate to the best of our ability. There are still difficult times ahead, but we must continue to support the precarious situation in Shanghai."

### Death of Newspaper Chairman Mr. Adams, Mourned by Chinese and Foreign Friends Alike

Mr. W.A. Adams, Chairman and General Manager of this newspaper's Board of Directors, suddenly suffered a stroke and passed away at the Country Hospital yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. He had lived in Shanghai for many years, had a wide circle of friends, and enjoyed a high reputation in the local property industry. His sudden death is mourned by Chinese and foreign friends alike. His wife and three children are currently residing in the eastern United States and will undoubtedly be even more saddened by the news. Mr. Adams was an American citizen, 59 years old this year, and was born in western Canada. He came to the Far East 30 years ago and worked as a surveyor in the Philippine Land Bureau. In 1914, he came to Shanghai and joined the China General Edison Company, eventually serving as its Chairman and General Manager until now. He also founded the Dragon and Co. Company, engaging in import and insurance businesses. He actively participated in various social activities of the American community in Shanghai, serving as a director of the American Association, the American Chamber of Commerce, the Columbia Country Club, and the Columbia Association. He was skilled in various sports, especially golf. The date of the funeral will be announced in the newspaper after it has been determined.

### Price Controls on Matches

The American Far East Match Company, in order to prevent hoarding and speculation in matches, announced the following price controls yesterday morning: Phoenix brand, 25 cents per box; Rose Tree brand, Wheel brand, and Tiger brand, 22 cents per box. All retailers must not exceed these price limits when selling, and must not supply customers with quantities exceeding normal needs.

### Large Quantity of Vietnamese Coal to Be Supplied to Shanghai

Responsible persons stated the other day that Shanghai will import a large quantity of Vietnamese anthracite coal in the coming months. The Japanese have stored more than 600,000 tons of bituminous coal in Shanghai, possibly for military use. If the Japanese were to allocate some of that stored coal for sale in Shanghai, coal prices would immediately fall. However, the Asia Development Company, which controls the stored coal, does not allow it to be sold, possibly due to orders from the Japanese military. The existing coal stocks in the two settlements are sufficient for needs, and Director-General Liddell of the Municipal Council has negotiated with the Stabilization Fund and has obtained foreign exchange to transport coal to Shanghai. Since Liddell went to Hong Kong to negotiate, coal retailers have not dared to purchase and hoard coal at black market prices, fearing that the Municipal Council will transport coal to Shanghai and coal prices will fall, resulting in losses. It is almost certain that the Municipal Council will transport a large quantity of coal from Vietnam to Shanghai within one or two months. As soon as Liddell announces the amount of foreign exchange allocated to the Municipal Council by the Stabilization Fund for purchasing coal, coal prices will plummet. Currently, the only place from which Shanghai can import large quantities of anthracite coal from the Far East is Vietnam. Japan is also currently importing anthracite coal from Vietnam, but Vietnam has sufficient coal and can supply Shanghai with even larger quantities.

### Liddell and Allman Return to Shanghai, Fruitful Trip to Hong Kong, Foreign Exchange for Essential Goods Reaches Five Million Dollars Monthly, Price Controls on One Hundred Types of Daily Necessities to Begin Soon

Mr. Liddell, Director-General of the Municipal Council, and Mr. Allman, American Director, who went to Hong Kong at the beginning of the month to meet with the Stabilization Fund authorities to discuss the issues of prices and exchange rates in Shanghai, returned here at 4:30 PM yesterday aboard the Jardine Matheson's Yushun ship.

Meetings Today and Tomorrow

According to sources, the Municipal Council will convene an emergency meeting this morning or tomorrow to listen to the reports of Mr. Liddell and Mr. Allman regarding their trip to Hong Kong, and to discuss taking further action to resolve the difficulties of controlling food prices and other prices after the Chamber of Commerce of Importers manages the prices of daily necessities. Yesterday morning, a spokesperson for the Municipal Council said, "The Municipal Council's plan is to gradually deal with hoarding and profiteering, and new measures will be taken in the near future to suppress high prices." These so-called "new measures" will be decided at the emergency meeting to be convened today and tomorrow, and will be implemented next week. The responsible persons of the Municipal Council have already understood the importance of adopting a "swift and decisive" approach, leaving no room for unscrupulous merchants and profiteers to breathe.

Foreign Exchange News

The Stabilization Fund supplies foreign exchange for essential goods, including rice, flour, coal, vegetable oil, and sugar. Although the exact amount of foreign exchange has not been officially disclosed by the Municipal Council, authoritative sources familiar with the matter claim that the total amount of foreign exchange is around five million U.S. dollars per month, including two million dollars for rice, equivalent to 38 million national currency, sufficient to purchase 250,000 bags of rice; one million dollars for coal, equivalent to 19 million national currency, sufficient to purchase 50,000 tons of bituminous coal and coal dust; and 300,000 dollars for flour, equivalent to 5.7 million national currency, sufficient to purchase approximately 200,000 bags of flour. The minimum necessary amounts of sugar and vegetable oil are also supplied.

Initial Distribution of 20,000 Bags of Rice

It was discussed that the Municipal Council had ordered wholesale rice shops to distribute 20,000 bags of rice to rice dealers who had sold out of rice. It was immediately decided to select the following fourteen wholesale shops to distribute the stored rice to the rice dealers who had sold out of rice: (1) Xieji 600 bags, (2) Xinji 150 bags, (3) Xinchang 646 bags, (4) Zhujiji 5302 bags, (5) Xiehe 200 bags, (6) Hengtai 367 bags, (7) Qiantai 9685 bags, (8) Shengxing 670 bags, (9) Hengxingren 1868 bags, (10) Xieji 100 bags, (11) Taiyu 100 bags, (12) Chengde 165 bags, (13) Hefeng 20 bags, (14) Yuchangde fill in the amount, totaling 20,000 bags, all for retail. The above rice shops are all located in the International Settlement. Rice shops in the French Concession, Hongkou, and Pudong must request approval from the authorities before releasing goods, including Saigon No. 11 rice, Siamese rice, Min Dang rice, and small pressed rice. National rice and broken rice are not included.

It was resolved that the distribution method for rice dealers lacking rice would be handled by Qu Zhenhua, the representative of the rice dealer industry. Rice dealers lacking rice should apply to Mr. Qu as soon as possible, and must pay with a silver dollar draft.

It was resolved that after the rice shops make the payment, Yang Heqing, the representative of the grain industry, would be responsible for handling the delivery procedures.

It was resolved that all wholesale rice shops must clear all the rice before next Monday.

It was resolved to elect Yang Heqing, Fu Qian'geng, and Qu Zhenhua as representatives to attend the Municipal Council's Food Management Meeting and request instructions on the method of adding twenty retail outlets for wholesale rice shops. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.

Over 30,000 Bags of Rice Arrived Yesterday

The Municipal Council's low-priced foreign rice arrived in Shanghai in large quantities yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Beihai ship brought 10,200 bags from Hong Kong, the Ninghai ship brought 15,300 bags from Hong Kong, and Jardine Matheson's Yushun ship also brought 5,100 bags from Hong Kong, for a total of 30,600 bags of foreign rice on the three ships. In the future, Shanghai's rice and the Municipal Council's purchased small pressed rice can be transported from Hong Kong in a steady stream.

Remedial Measures for Confiscated Rice

Reporters from Xin Sheng News inquired with the authorities of the two settlements yesterday and learned that the two authorities are now taking into consideration the difficulties of merchants and maintaining legitimate merchants. Therefore, they have stipulated remedial measures for rice that was previously confiscated on the road.

If a resident entrusts a rice shop to transport rice and it does not exceed half a dan or one dan, and only once, the citizen can declare the reason and the quality of the rice to the two authorities, and submit supporting documents, and the original rice can be returned in full.

If a rice merchant is transporting rice without a special permit and is detained by the police and sent to the bureau, the rice merchant can also present reasons to the authorities. If the reason is deemed legitimate, the confiscated rice can also be returned.

### Labor Strike at Da Lai Cotton Mill Successfully Resolved

### Large Quantity of Gold Bars Found on the Taikoo Company's Yuezhou Ship, Confiscated by Customs Authorities

The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou ship arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin the day before yesterday and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. The customs search team boarded the ship at night and found many gold bars in the radio room, worth over three million yuan. The customs authorities confiscated them. Several Chinese crew members of the ship are currently being questioned by the customs police, but no one has been formally arrested. It is reported that the Yuezhou ship sailed from Tianjin three days ago. It is believed that the gold bars were placed on the ship by Chinese in Tianjin. The customs authorities refused to disclose details.

According to another report, the Jianghai Customs search team found a large batch of gold bars, about 500, on the Yuezhou ship, which arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin the other day. The search lasted for several hours before it ended. All of them have been escorted to the Jianghai Customs for valuation. According to current estimates, the gold bars (ten taels each) are worth over 10 million national currency. It is reported that the customs received a tip-off in advance, so the ship was directly searched in the radio room after it arrived at the port.

### Forging Power of Attorney to Extort a Huge Sum of Money, Principal Offender at Large, Three Accomplices Arrested

Jiang Zhonglin, owner of the Jiang Yuantai Leather Goods Shop located at 7 Lane 524 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, and resident at 650 Rue Lafayette, is wealthy. Last month, Song Dexiang, the driver of Huang Shiping, the owner of the Yuanhe Sugar Company on Minkuo Road (a relative of Jiang), Zhang Ruliang, a bodyguard, and a tea servant nicknamed San Mazi, colluded with Chen Yihe, a fortune teller, to write a fake military commission appointing Jiang Zhonglin as the commander of the Fourth Division. After it was written, Zhang Ruliang hid the fake commission in Jiang Zhonglin's living room, intending to report it to the Japanese Gendarmerie, arrest Jiang, extort a large sum of money, and divide it among themselves. Unexpectedly, the next day, Jiang's family was entertaining guests and ordered people to clean up the living room, and they accidentally found the letter. After reading it, Jiang ordered it to be destroyed. Song and others knew that the matter had failed and were unwilling to proceed. However, San Mazi insisted that Song and others continue, and paid four yuan to have Chen Yihe write another fake commission, intending to frame Jiang. While they were discussing this, Chen Yihe had a whimsical idea and wrote a letter to Jiang's family alone, saying, "Someone is plotting to harm you, sir. I know the details and am willing to explain them in person. Please arrange a meeting." He intended to swindle a large reward. However, Jiang ignored the letter. When Chen came again to ask for a meeting, the victim reported it to the French police, who ordered detectives to wait at Jiang's home. When Chen Yihe arrived, he was immediately arrested and confessed everything. Song and Zhang were subsequently arrested, but San Mazi escaped without a trace. An order has been issued to arrest him and bring him to justice.

After a detailed hearing of witnesses, the court sentenced Ni Fushen to three years and six months in prison for causing death by injury. The civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.

### Unpredictable Gold Market

Yesterday's spot gold in the dark market was unpredictable, starting with a rise, then a sharp drop, and finally being pushed up again. After retreating from the 21,000 yuan mark, it immediately came back out. It seems that people's hearts are in a state of uncertainty. The withdrawal of the Far East US garrison was not unexpected. The important key between the US and Japan lies in the time when the Japanese ambassador Laixi returns to his country. There are conflicting opinions on whether gold is good for storage, so it was not affected. At the beginning of the morning, it rose to a high price of 21,100 yuan, continuing the rising momentum of the previous day, but Shishihe sold 610 taels, and Chengji sold 400 taels. Defu, the securities firm that had made a mad rush the previous day, also came back to sell 990 taels, and the price suddenly fell sharply to 20,550 yuan. Unexpectedly, Dafeng became more and more courageous, and bought another 1,460 taels. Tianyuan also bought in 1,110 taels, and the upward trend was revived, returning above 21,000 yuan. The market closed up 200 yuan. A total of 15,480 taels were traded in half a day. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday, and gold jewelry also rose by 20 yuan, to 2,160 yuan.

Spot Gold Rises Sharply Again

Since the market opened at 9:00 AM, each tael (ten taels) was 100 yuan higher, at 21,200 yuan. Mingfeng and Tianyuan competed to buy, and retail investors followed the trend, frantically pushing up the price, soaring by 400 yuan, to 21,600 yuan. Shishihe, Xianghe, and Chengji suddenly came to sell, and Mingfeng also sold, immediately falling back by 600 yuan, retreating to 21,000 yuan. Dafeng, Tianyuan, and Defu bought up to 21,200 yuan, and Yifeng and Defu also came to sell. Dafeng also sold less, and Chengji and Xianghe sold again, and the market situation suddenly softened, and the price plummeted by 650 yuan, falling to 20,550 yuan. After 10:00 AM, Dafeng and Tianyuan were even more eager to buy. Retail investors who went short rushed to cover their positions, and the upward trend resumed sharply in the buying frenzy, rising by 750 yuan, rising straight to 10:30 AM. The market closed at 21,300 yuan, up 200 yuan from the previous day. After the close, Dafeng went up to 21,500 yuan, and Defu sold up to 21,350 yuan, and finally 21,400 yuan. In half a day, there was a high and low of 1,050 yuan. There was no market outside the venue in the afternoon. The spot gold of cash stores, the retail price was 21,500 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by about 1,000 yuan.

Gold Jewelry Rises by 10 Yuan

The price of gold jewelry per tael was 2,170 yuan for major and new peers. It fell in two small steps, a total of 70 yuan, to 2,100 yuan. Soon after, it went back up by 60 yuan, to 2,160 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan), up 20 yuan, it is said.

### Foreign Exchange Stagnates, US Dollar Falls Sharply

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the Central and Huiyi lists did not change, and the HSBC small power price became more and more stable. The black market for British and American exchanges, etc., the 14 foreign banks are absolutely not allowed to draw accounts, which has completely entered a state of stagnation. Even if there are sellers seeking to sell, no one responds. However, a certain Chinese broker in New York, who was entrusted by an exporter to sell 15 million yuan, also started to wait and see. The market price is above 3 yuan for the US dollar and 2 yuan for the British pound. There was no market in the afternoon, it is said.

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, the British and American gold pounds followed the spot price, rising by 5 yuan. The British gold note fell sharply, and retreated to 70 yuan in the evening market. The US gold note fell more and more sharply, once retreating to 30 yuan, and finally was 33.2 yuan, still a 2.8 yuan drop compared to the previous day. The Hong Kong note also tended to soften. In addition, currencies such as Singapore, Annam, Robi, Canada, the Philippines, and Australian gold notes also tended to fall. Japanese and Korean gold notes fell sharply. The former retreated to 3.2 yuan, and the latter fell to 3.1 yuan.

### Central One Yuan New Note Has a Special Kind of Charm

A new kind of one yuan note issued by the Central Bank has recently become popular on the market, in a small number. It was printed by Zhonghua Book Company and is a 1936 edition. Various banknotes have never used ancient coins as patterns, but this one changes the style, full of a color representing currency, and the colors are even and not glaring. It is antique, elegant and not vulgar. Among the various banknotes that have been issued, this one is considered the best. On the front is a portrait of President Sun, and to his left in an octagon is a phoenix-eared tripod. The phoenix-eared tripod was originally a weapon from the Warring States Period, with two birds

### New Money Shops Without Ministry Permits Not Allowed to Join Money Bank

The Shanghai Money Industry Joint Reserve Bank issued a notice yesterday, stating that it has been approved by the joint meeting of the Money Industry Association and the Money Bank Executive Committee on November 4 that, starting from the 5th of this month, all newly established money shops that have not received Ministry permits and have not been officially listed are not allowed to open accounts and trade at this bank, and participate in inter-industry bill exchange. However, those who have already opened accounts at this bank are not subject to this restriction.

According to a circular from the Shanghai Silver Industry Association to various banks, the Qianku replied that Baochang and Tailai money shops have joined the bank as members. From the 14th (that is, the day before yesterday), various banks will collect payment notes from these shops and entrust the association to collect them on their behalf. Please handle them in the same way as other member shops, it is said.

### Multi-Head Front Collapses; Yarn Again Hits Limit Down

Yarn Market: Setbacks and a strong bearish trend prevail in the yarn market. This is due to the cessation of spot yarn trading, leading to increased inventories. Those who profited are eager to sell. Simultaneously, the Far East situation is increasingly severe, particularly unsettling hoarders. Furthermore, recent measures by the concession authorities to control prices have been strict, causing a general price decline. This situation further frightens hoarders, causing the market to decline. As for the intensifying bearish trend in yarn, generally old national yarn brands, seeing their outlets cut off, have been sold off in large numbers at the Double Horse market recently due to tight credit conditions. As a result, one side is unsustainable. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 2,560 yuan, the low price 2,410 yuan. Regarding the design of the new one-yuan paper currency, there is a cover with four bird heads as decoration, and a knot in the middle. Now, on the belly of the tripod, one circle and the character "一" (one) are carved. The background pattern is in the shape of coins, with the seal script characters for "Central Bank" in the middle, interspersed with the characters "壹圓" (one yuan). Four "壹" (one) characters are placed at the four corners, decorated with a meander pattern. Ancient coins are used as the border pattern on the top and bottom sides. On the upper end, nine half-tael coins, with the characters "中央" (central) embedded in the middle. The back is coffee-colored. Apart from the border pattern, the upper left and right corners of the four corners are in the shape of a "敦" (dun - a type of ancient food container), and the lower two corners are in the shape of a "鼎" (ding - a type of ancient cooking pot), each with "I Yuan" carved inside. In the middle is printed the stone carving of Confucius Asking About Rituals from the Wu Liang Shrine, with Confucius holding a goose as a presentation gift, facing Lao Dan (Lao Tzu) standing with his back to a horse. The feet of Lao Dan are round bead-shaped, with "1" and "One Yuan," covered by leaf-shaped patterns on the outer edge. Calculating the current material and labor costs, the cost of this one-yuan banknote is likely not less than one yuan. See attached picture for details. The closing price was 2,470 yuan. There was no afternoon session due to the usual weekend closure.

The Double Horse market opened in the morning with poor news, and selling was rampant. The opening price immediately fell by 78 yuan, followed by even more selling pressure. Those covering their positions became more crowded. At the same time, yarn and cloth prices on the exchange fell sharply, further weakening sentiment. The price plunged to 2,480 yuan, triggering a limit down. However, sellers outside the exchange remained enthusiastic, with a low of 2,410 yuan. Later, the yarn and cloth prices on the exchange recovered slightly, bringing the price up to 2,470 yuan at the close. Trading volume for the half-day totaled 2,800 bales.

The Double Horse futures market followed the usual practice of trading only for half a day in the morning, and the downward trend intensified. This was because news reports confirmed the withdrawal of U.S. troops, causing widespread panic. Trading was sparse, and the multi-head front collapsed. Large players competed to exit their positions, while short sellers took the opportunity to manipulate both sides, creating a strong selling atmosphere that prevented prices from rebounding and led to a sharp limit down. The November contract opened at 2,230 yuan in the morning, initially remaining stable, dropping about 100 yuan. However, factory orders and miscellaneous brands then fell sharply, causing market sentiment to fluctuate and selling to increase sharply. The market headed straight down. The November contract first suffered a sharp drop, with the limit down price at 1,225.00, a decrease of 200 yuan. The December contract followed suit, opening at 2,365 yuan and immediately dropping 200 yuan, also hitting limit down. The January contract was no exception, opening with a severe drop of 200 yuan and also hitting limit down. There was no afternoon session. Given the trend, it is difficult for sentiment to stabilize before there are signs of stability in the overall situation, so the market remains weak. However, a rebound is likely to be significant, so all those involved should exercise caution. The following is a table summarizing the market:

November  December  January

Open 2,230.0 2,365.0 2,450.0
High 2,220.0 2,365.0 2,450.0
Low 2,350.0 2,465.0 2,450.0
Close 2,225.0 2,365.0 2,450.0
Change Down 200.0 Down 200.0 Down 200.0

### Cotton Also Plummets; No One Wants It

The spot cotton situation has suddenly worsened. Due to the weak yarn market and the lack of sales channels, the closely related cotton market has also plummeted by a significant 50 to 60 yuan, with no buyers.

Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Ninghai vessel arrived at port yesterday morning, carrying 1,974 bales of cotton. This cotton originated from India.

The New York cotton market initially rose due to a large consumption volume in October and continuous buying by Wall Street. However, it subsequently fell back due to selling by spot traders and profit-taking by long positions. As a result, the closing price was approximately 5 to 6 points lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering by cotton merchants and buying by European exporters. However, it subsequently fell back due to public selling and long position liquidation. Yesterday's closing prices were down 3 to 4 rupees respectively. It is predicted that today's opening market will be similar to the closing market price.

### Nervous Longs Rush to Exit; Cotton Cloth Market Very Weak

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market saw nervous longs rushing to sell due to the order to withdraw U.S. defense forces. Market prices continued to weaken. In the afternoon, due to certain rumors, quoted prices suddenly rose, making the market situation quite chaotic. As a result, coarse and fine cloth twill fell by 1.5 to 6 yuan compared to the previous day. Bleached and dyed cloth lacked a firm market, falling by approximately 3 to 5 yuan. Wholesale dealers on this street generally took a wait-and-see attitude. Hoarders and fellow traders absorbed at lower prices, with approximately 300 pieces traded. Today, 300 pieces of cloth are being shipped to Weihaiwei, and another 100 pieces are being shipped to Yantai.

Eastern Cloth: The morning opened with a sharp drop in yarn prices, making the market very weak. Futures cloth on the exchange fell by a significant 6 yuan per piece. However, it rose slightly at the close. Each month's contract fell by 4.21 to 5.09 yuan per piece. Spot goods from leading factories saw even greater fluctuations. The minimum price in the morning was 79 yuan, but by the afternoon close, some short positions were covered, bringing the price back to 85.5 yuan, but still down 4.5 yuan from the previous day. "Gentleman's Serge" opened with a sharp drop to 3 yuan per yard, with the closing price rising to 3.2 yuan, but there were no actual sales; all were speculative transactions.

### Woolens Being Hoarded

Yesterday, the woolen market was tight due to a lack of supply, combined with currency devaluation and rising gold prices, leading to sharply increased costs. Local factory production is slow, raw materials are scarce, and inventories are dwindling. All types of thick and thin, good and bad, patterned and plain woolens are in short supply. In addition, various large and small companies, hoarders, and groups within and outside the industry are all constantly hoarding. Most goods owners are doing their best to hoard and demand high prices. Yesterday, ordinary English flannel sold for 70 yuan, American Feng coats for 110 yuan, local Parker's cloth for 50 yuan, riding breeches for 77-78 yuan, Walter's cloth for 65-66 yuan, suit cloth for 80 yuan, black carbon lining for 7.5 yuan, printed poplin for 5 yuan, and mercerized feather yarn for 4.4 yuan.

### Crowded Longs; Government Bonds Suddenly Rebound

The over-the-counter market for government bonds suddenly rebounded yesterday. Class C bonds broke through both the 9 yuan and 8 yuan levels. Generally, people believe that the U.S. passage of amendments to the Neutrality Act and the withdrawal of U.S. Marines stationed in China are unfavorable. In fact, darkness is the future of light. Since the government began collecting foreign exchange from the public and the U.S. freezing order can now be accommodated, the government has a firm grip on both finance and military affairs. Therefore, the darker the situation, the faster the arrival of light. The fall of government bonds is simply unnecessary anxiety on the part of ordinary people. Probably, the continuous selling in recent days was excessive, leading to crowding and a slight increase in bearish sentiment. However, those with a long-term perspective are still buying on dips. Yesterday was Saturday, with only one trading session. Class C bonds opened at 8 yuan. However, sentiment then strengthened, rising to 8.8 yuan, with Tongkang, Dingkang, and Yongchang among the buyers. Jiufeng entered and exited, while Lianhe and Fengxie were net sellers. After entering, Lianhe again dumped, and Class C bonds broke through the 8 yuan level. The trend, even if slightly downward, is limited. As a result, market prices generally fell back by 0.85 to 1.57 yuan. Trading volume was approximately 2 million yuan. The following is a simplified table:

Category  Highest  Lowest  Closing  Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 75.00  74.30  74.25  Down 1.25
Unified B 69.85  69.30  69.30  Down 1.20
Unified C 68.60  67.70  67.70  Down 1.57
Unified D 64.90  64.60  64.60  Down 0.85
Unified E 68.40  67.50  67.50  Down 1.45

Stock trading: 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity stock were traded at a price of 17.5 yuan.

### Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai in a Steady Stream; Market Still Stagnant

Large quantities of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Beihai vessel and Ninghai vessel arrived at port one after another yesterday morning. The two vessels brought 25,500 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, with the Beihai vessel carrying 10,200 bags and the remaining 15,300 bags transported by the Ninghai vessel. They docked at the Taikoo Company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. In addition, the Jardine Matheson Company's Yusheng vessel arrived at port yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, also carrying 5,100 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt wharf for unloading. Yesterday, the three vessels together brought 30,600 bags of foreign rice, all of which are the Municipal Council's low-priced small-grain rice.

Yesterday, there was still no market for foreign rice. Business must wait for instructions from the mainland to adjust, and from the Municipal Council, before operations can resume.

### Flour at 40 Yuan; Still Few Buyers Willing to Accept

Foreign flour is dull and lifeless, and market transactions remain sluggish. Apart from direct allocations, spot sales on this street are poor. Customer囤 do not want to inquire. Most intend to sell off at a loss as prices decline. As a result, Golden Dragon brand has dropped to 38 yuan, but there are still few buyers willing to accept it. Even at the price of 38 yuan, it is more than 20 yuan lower than the highest price. Bran stocks are almost depleted, and the market is still able to stand. Small packages are priced from 53 yuan to 53.5 yuan, which is more stacked than the previous market. Shipments of wheat have disappeared, and warehouse goods have all been allocated to factories. The market is also stagnant, but Japanese factories are still buying at the original prices, it is said.

Large quantities of foreign flour and foreign corn are being shipped north. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou vessel departed from Shanghai for Tianjin yesterday at noon, also stopping at Yantai and Weihaiwei, carrying 30,000 bags of foreign flour to Tianjin, 250 bags of foreign corn to Weihaiwei, and 1,250 bags to Yantai.

### Edible Oil Being Dumped; Price Drops Another 20 Yuan

The market for miscellaneous grains, oil, and oil cakes was sluggish and lifeless yesterday. Edible oil prices have fallen sharply by another 10 to 20 yuan due to continuous dumping by hoarders. Soybeans were weak and saw no transactions. Corn generally fell by 2, 3, or 4 yuan. The total market transactions included 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 300 cans of Jiangbei raw oil, 60 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 200 cans of Yantai soybean oil, 500 dan of Da You factory refined oil, 600 dan of various factory vegetable oils, 50 bags of Chongming red sand, and over 1,000 bags of spot corn and 200 tons of futures corn. It is also heard that some restless elements in the miscellaneous grains industry have recently taken certain actions to resist. Today, 150 bags of beans are being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market Continues to Decline; Large Shipments of Foreign Sugar Arrive in Shanghai

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was weak. With the joint venture company's futures contract suspended and not yet restored, hoarders competed to sell. Furthermore, rumors of the futures contract needing to be settled made sentiment weak. The market declined across the board. For spot goods, such as No. 24 coarse white sugar for October, the morning opened at 248 yuan, then fell to 25 yuan before recovering to 40 yuan. The afternoon opened at 239 to 236 yuan, resulting in a continuation of the slight 18 yuan drop from the previous market. September opened at 235 to 222 yuan and 30 yuan in the morning, and 232 to 33 yuan in the afternoon, a slight 19 yuan drop. August opened at 130 yuan in the morning, falling to 15 yuan before recovering to 26 yuan. The afternoon opened at 30 yuan, a slight drop of 20 yuan. Hong Kong coarse white opened at 200 yuan to 195 yuan in the morning and 210 yuan in the afternoon, a slight drop of 10 yuan. Taikoo white DY was 200 yuan. Dutch red opened at 180 yuan to 83 yuan in the morning and 85 yuan in the afternoon, down 8 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was over 19,000 bags of spot goods.

Large quantities of granulated sugar continued to arrive in Shanghai rapidly. The Taikoo Company's Beihai vessel arrived at port yesterday morning. In addition to carrying large quantities of foreign rice from Hong Kong, it also carried 11,000 bags of granulated sugar. In addition, the Jardine Matheson Company's Yusheng vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 3,600 bags of granulated sugar from Hong Kong. Today, 5,000 bags of granulated sugar are being loaded onto the Taikoo Company's Yuezhou vessel for shipment to Tianjin tomorrow.

### New Hoarding of Daily Necessities Revives

The market for cigarettes, matches, soap, and candles saw significant fluctuations. Due to the Municipal Council's strict management of rice and grain, there were rumors that daily necessities would be implemented starting next week. This caused widespread panic among ordinary merchants, who sought to sell off their holdings, leading to a sharp drop in buying prices. Unexpectedly, when trading opened yesterday, prices rose again because new hoarding interests, acting as accomplices, returned to buy up goods at lower prices. Therefore, the market has become tight again. If strict enforcement is not implemented, prices may still reach their highest peaks. It is hoped that stabilizing prices will reduce the burden on ordinary people and live up to the expectations of the public.

### The Spirit of Science

— Li Yi

Little friends! After reading the previous issue's "How to Set Up a Small Laboratory," you must feel like you have to do it right away! A scientist increases the power of the country and seeks happiness for mankind. However, the success of scientists is always the result of hard work. What I want to particularly discuss here is their scientific spirit.

What is the scientific spirit? It can probably be summarized into the following points:

A spirit of sacrifice: Since the scientist's goal is to seek happiness for the masses, then personal peace and life and death are naturally put aside! Some scientists go through life and death, using themselves as test subjects, and how great is their pain! Some scientists become disabled due to experiments, and some scientists unfortunately die. Although their bodies are sacrificed, their contributions have greater significance.

A spirit of fearlessness: If scientists are willing to sacrifice for science, then all difficulties will never be able to frustrate them. Hundreds of failures, thousands of unsuccessful attempts, are simply nothing to scientists! The word "difficulty" never exists in the minds of scientists.

A spirit of consistency: Scientists are doing the most difficult thing in the world. How can they succeed if they do not concentrate and study with consistency? Scientists never have a "half-hearted" attitude. Looking at some scientists who work with such dedication that they forget to eat and sleep, even on their deathbeds they are still mindful of their work. How admirable is their perseverance!

A spirit of precision: Scientists regard science as their first life, and there is no second thing in their minds; the knowledge they seek is true knowledge that is true and substantial, and it is definitely not some superficial or decorative thing. They seek knowledge thoroughly, precisely, and delicately. Only in this way will they have great success.

Little friends, what China needs is not empty talkers, but practical scientists! May you uphold the spirit of scientists, bury yourselves in hard work, and one day become great scientists admired by all. "Where there is a will, there is a way," and I wish you success soon!

### Autumn Leaves

— Wan Wen

The weather is getting colder day by day, and it is already deep autumn. In a garden, there are two siblings, the elder sister named Ai Ying and the younger brother named Ming Xiong. They are playing in the garden after school. Suddenly, they look up and see the green maple leaves turning into bright red, and the tall sycamore trees wearing yellow crowns. A gust of wind blows, and red and yellow leaves fall sparsely on the ground. The ground is like a carpet of yellow. The siblings walk on the comfortable carpet, silently picking up red leaves. The elder sister suddenly thought of something and said to her younger brother, "Look at all these leaves, can't they be used to cook? Let's sweep them up and send them to mom." That evening at dinner, the children were eating dinner, and the mother looked at the fallen leaves on the trees outside the window and asked the children, "Why do the leaves of the trees turn yellow in autumn?" These two children had never thought about this question before and were stunned by their mother's question. The mother said, "You don't know, let me tell you. Leaves originally have three kinds of pigments: chlorophyll, anthocyanin, and xanthophyll. In spring and summer, when the weather is warm and there is plenty of rain, chlorophyll and sunlight and moisture create nutrients, so chlorophyll is especially developed, covering up the other two pigments. Therefore, the leaves are green. In autumn and winter, the weather gradually becomes cold, and the leaves receive less sunlight. In addition, there is heavy frost. The chlorophyll gradually decreases, revealing the other two pigments. Leaves with more anthocyanin are red, and sycamore trees have more xanthophyll, so they are yellow. Do you understand now?" The two of them were engrossed, but unexpectedly, their mother stopped at this point, and they asked, "Mom, then why do the leaves fall?" The mother continued, "Simply because the weather is cold, the water absorbed by the roots is insufficient to supply the leaves. Chlorophyll cannot continue to work, so the leaves gradually detach from the tree trunk and fall to the ground." The siblings were interested and said in unison, "So that's how it is. Today we learned something new again." The mother said, "Yes, whatever happens in the world, as long as you are willing to pay attention to research at any time, what is not your knowledge?" After listening, they happily took their brooms and dustpans and went back to the garden.

### Not Afraid

— Yi Zhi

In the past, there was a famous British naval general named Nelson who was very bold and courageous from a young age.

When he was studying at school, there was a pear tree in the school that bore many lovely fruits, but the tree grew in a very dangerous place. All the students wanted to eat them but were afraid to pick them. He obtained permission from the school and fearlessly devised a way to pick all the pears on the tree and share them with everyone. A classmate asked him, "Why are you willing to risk picking them?" He said, "I saw that you were afraid, so I went to pick them."

On another occasion, when he was very young, he and some children from the neighborhood went to play in the countryside. They ran around and got lost, and he didn't come back by dinner time. His family was very worried and went to look for him separately. Finally, they found him sitting calmly by a small river that he couldn't cross. His grandmother asked him, "Aren't you afraid?" He said, "What is fear? What is fear all about? I don't even know."

### Clothes (Part 2)

— Lin Ren

"Dad, you're really amazing. How can you tell the difference between fake wool and real wool?" A Liang asked as he stepped into the house.

"That's very easy. You can tell just by holding a wool fabric in your hand. If it's real wool, the texture is very soft, the weave is very fine, and it doesn't wrinkle at all when you grip it. Fake wool is different. The texture is very rough, and it wrinkles easily. That's the general difference between them. But there's an even better way to tell, and that's to buy some caustic soda chemicals from the pharmacy, dissolve two parts of caustic soda in one hundred parts of water, heat it up, cut a piece of woolen cloth and soak it in the solution. If the cloth doesn't change at all, then you can be sure that it's not all wool; it must have some cotton mixed in. If the cloth dissolves completely, then you can be sure that it's made of all wool. What's the reason for this? It's because caustic soda solution can dissolve wool fibers but cannot dissolve cotton fibers. As for telling the difference between rayon and real silk fabrics, that's also very easy. Just pull out one or two threads from the piece of silk, light a match and burn them. If you smell a foul odor when it burns, and the thread curls up, then that's proof that it's real silk; otherwise, if you don't smell any foul odor when it burns, and it turns into some black ash, then it must be made of rayon. This really fits the saying, "Real gold is not afraid of fire." Because the texture of rayon and real silk is completely different, natural silk is silk that silkworms spin, and it contains protein; while rayon is made artificially from chemical substances and doesn't have a protein component, so its original form is immediately revealed after burning."

A Liang's mother took out last year's winter clothes from the box and sorted them, because the cold weather was just around the corner. The old woman found a lot of year-old grease stains on one of A Liang's cotton robes, so she dipped some cotton in gasoline and used it to wipe off the grease stain. After the gasoline dried, the grease stain was gone, which made A Liang very curious, so he asked his father again.

"Dad, why can gasoline remove grease stains from clothes?"

"That's because when grease stains on clothes come into contact with gasoline, the gasoline can dissolve the grease stains in it. But gasoline is very volatile, which is why a drop of gasoline exposed to the air dries up in an instant. So it's also called volatile oil. When the grease stains dissolve in the gasoline, because the gasoline is volatile, the grease stains evaporate with it, and the grease stains on the clothes disappear."

### Overview of Chinese Hospitals: Well-Organized with Complete Equipment; Free Childbirth for the Impoverished Benefits the Common People

Since Dr. Wang Boyuan took over the leadership of Chinese Hospital, he has meticulously planned and prepared it to a large scale. The internal organization is strict, and all kinds of equipment are complete. The main treatment subjects are divided into internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics, ophthalmology, smoking cessation, cardiology, gastroenterology, dermatology, urogenital, first aid for poisoning, otolaryngology, X-ray, physical therapy, electrotherapy, etc. Each department is treated by specialized physicians who use their extensive experience to fulfill their duty of service. Therefore, patients who seek treatment are often cured, and the hospital has thus gained a good reputation, with increasing prosperity in its medical affairs. Its contribution to benefiting patients is not small. The hospital is affiliated with the Hongkou Public Maternity Hospital, which provides safe childbirth services with remarkable results. For impoverished pregnant women, free childbirth services are provided, and their enthusiastic service has won the approval of society. The main hospital is located on Huade Road, Tilanqiao, and the branch is located on Paike Road, Xinzha Road, telephone numbers 50004 and 37047. It also stated that there are no other branches.

Entertainment World

### Sketch of Lana Turner

— Wei Ceng

Lana Turner, the female lead in the Greater China's new film "Ziegfeld Girl," is becoming more and more popular. With her intelligence and beauty, it is not difficult to achieve the position of a big star. Not long ago, she and Artie Shaw had a romance that stirred up the entire film industry. On February 8, 1921, a six-and-a-half-pound baby was born in Wallace, Idaho. She is now Hollywood's most famous "sexy girl." Her parents gave her many names. Those close to her called her Judy. The neighborhood children jokingly called her "Carrot."

When she was three years old, they moved to San Francisco. She attended a local convent school. So Lana had a very happy and beautiful childhood. But when she was ten years old, her father passed away. Her mother's health was also destroyed by hard work and sorrow. So in 1935, they decided to move to Hollywood, because the warm climate there was beneficial to her mother's health. Lana's original ambition was to become a fashion designer after graduating from high school. But fate in Hollywood is magical. And a scoop of ice cream soda in a drugstore on the corner is always a good introduction (because many stars are discovered here). Lana also met a friend of Mervyn LeRoy there. When he saw this girl with red hair, gray-green eyes, magnolia-like skin, and a curvy figure, he thought she was very suitable for a girl's role in a new film. He persuaded her to meet this great director. Three days later, she signed a contract with a film company. From there, she rose step by step and actually became a box-office star.

### Random Notes from the Peking Opera World

— Cun Ren

It is feared that martial artist Luo Lian would not be able to come to Shanghai with Li Shaochun. However, Li's father, Xiaodazi, as well as Mao Qinglai, Gao Weilian, and Su Lianhan, will come together. As for the second leading actress, Bai Yuwei, there is one supporting actor named Xin Liqin. The Gongwu Stage will add two more actors, Wang Yingwu and Lin Baokun, who will soon take the stage. Regarding the rumors of Chen Hefeng and Yun Yanxia joining, negotiations must wait until they return to Shanghai. Qilintong's brother-in-law, Liu Wuli, is currently preparing to restore the Tianyunlou Grand Peking Opera Troupe and is inviting Yang Nong, Zheng Liheng, and other actors to perform.

### Movie and Drama Snippets

— Sea Star

"Midnight" on Stage: Mao Dun's "Midnight" takes the collapse of a large family as its warp and the downfall of speculators as its weft. It is a powerful literary work. When it was first published, it caused a sensation, surpassing Ba Jin's "Home." I now understand that it will also be adapted for the stage. The Shanghai Drama and Art Society's directing department is responsible for Ba Jin's "Home," which was adapted into a stage play by Wu Tian. Due to the exceptional box office success after its performance, Wu Tian has decided to adapt the sequels to "Home," "Spring" and "Autumn." "Spring" is already being actively adapted by Wu Tian and will be completed soon.

"Love Letters" to Be Performed: Tang Ruoqing's first play on the Tiangong stage was set to be "Lady City," adapted by Wei Ruhui and directed by Bu Wancang. However, due to other reasons, it was postponed. Now, "Love Letters," a famous world stage play, will be performed before "Lady City." Tang Huaiqiu will also participate in the play, playing the role of a lawyer. The play will still be directed by Bu Wancang. "Love Letters" has already been adapted into a movie in Hollywood, starring Bette Davis in "Letter From An Unknown Woman."

Zhou Xuan's New Songs: Zhou Xuan's song recording "The Flower of Understanding" was very popular with audiences. Therefore, in her new work "Annoying Spring Colors," she will still insert many new songs, such as Chen Gexin's "Pastor's Song," which are all quite pleasing to the ear.

Minhua Seeking Actors: Minhua has decided to start filming Fei Mu's "National Beauty and Heavenly Fragrance" next month, but the main actors are still being sought after and cannot be determined at this time. As for Zhang Yi, a basic member of Minhua, he is temporarily not returning to Shanghai due to his busy work in Hong Kong.

Laozi and Shi Zi: When "Princess Iron Fan" is screened, the humorous satirical short film "Laozi and Shi Zi," co-starring Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, Hong Jingling, Zhang Guangzhi, Zhao Zhigui, Ye Xiaozhu, etc., will be specially added. It is said that the content of the film is quite amusing.

### Jiyou Society Performs "Women's Apartment"

The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association has always attached great importance to promoting proper entertainment for women and the development of healthy interests. The postal female employees of the Association's Jiyou Society have a particular interest in drama. The society is currently rehearsing "Women's Apartment," which is scheduled to be performed at the Lyceum Theatre at 3 pm and 8 pm on Friday, the 21st of this month. The purchase of tickets has been exceptionally enthusiastic in recent days. It is said that the society has decided to donate all the proceeds to fulfill the two thousand yuan that the society pledged during the YWCA's fundraising campaign.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 19: Dusk, the Tartar Cavalry Filled the City with Dust

"Even if the worst comes to pass, you and I, Brother Liu, should think of assassinating the traitor and creating some achievements ourselves. What's wrong with that?" Liu Yinying looked at Xu Jing's face and smiled gently, "Brother Jing being able to do this, truly△ conforms to my intentions. We should work together to eradicate the great disaster for the country. We shouldn't think of ourselves as too insignificant. If I, your younger brother, could command a hundred thousand troops, I would never be like Wu Sangui, cautiously and timidly hesitating and shrinking back, seeking help from other countries." Xu Jing laughed, "I hope you will be able to do so in the future. Throughout history, which great general was not initially in a subordinate position? Because he could charge into battle, capture generals and raise flags, and make great achievements, he rose rapidly and took sole command of the tiger tally." Liu Yinying said, "I, your younger brother, am willing to encourage each other with Brother Jing." The two spoke along the way, their horses' hooves treading on the moon, slowly returning to their camp, unloading their baggage, and remaining on the edge of Shanhaiguan. Wu Sangui, having already requested assistance from the Qing court, also fed his horses and sharpened his weapons, preparing to join forces with the Qing army to attack Li Chuang. Hearing that Dorgon's large army had arrived at Sushan, he hoped that the Qing army would quickly enter the pass, so he wrote another letter urging them. The letter read: Receiving your Majesty's letter, I know that the army has already arrived at Ningyuan to save the people, attack the violent, support the weak, and eliminate the strong. Your righteous voice shakes the heavens and the earth. The reason for our assistance is truly for our late Emperor, and Sangui's gratitude is but a small token. Sangui accepts Your Majesty's instructions and will dispatch elite troops to the key points west of Shanhaiguan to lure the bandits to come quickly. Now the bandits are personally leading their 　feathered　 hordes, swarming around Yongping. This is throwing themselves into a trap, and Heaven's will is knowable. Sangui has carefully selected elite troops to plan a mutual annihilation. I hope Your Majesty will quickly mobilize your tiger-like troops and enter Shanhaiguan directly, attacking from both ends. The rebel can be captured, and the east and west of the capital can be settled with　 a proclamation. Furthermore, the army of benevolence and righteousness places the greatest importance on pacifying the people. Therefore, the most important thing is to issue a strict proclamation. I further pray that your Majesty orders the army to commit no offense, then the people's hearts will be won, and wealth and territory will also be obtained. What cannot be accomplished? (220)
