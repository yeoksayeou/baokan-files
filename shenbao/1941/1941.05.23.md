### Successful Operations in the Zhongtiao Mountains; The Southern Shanxi Chinese Army Firmly Defends Original Positions; Only a Small Garrison Maintained by the Japanese at the Yellow River Crossing; Japanese Troops on the Ji-Yuan Highway Repeatedly Attacked by Chinese Troops

Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesperson stated that the Chinese forces in the Zhongtiao Mountains and Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi are still holding firm. Troops defending the northern front have shifted their positions to more advantageous locations. The spokesperson announced that the Japanese army only maintains a small garrison at the Yellow River crossing, while the main force has moved north towards the Zhongtiao and Taihang Mountains. The Japanese army is also consolidating its positions along the Jiyuan-Yuanqu highway, but Chinese forces have attacked the road from both the north and south. The spokesperson also stated, "I strongly suspect that the Japanese army destroyed the Chinese army's positions in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Zaoyang, in northern Hubei, 142 miles northwest of Hankou, has been captured and lost three times since it was occupied by the Japanese army on May 12. As a result, the Chinese army recaptured the area on May 16. The Japanese army has now retreated to its original positions." (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)

Chongqing: According to an official report released by the Chinese side last night, the Chinese army recaptured Zhuji, a strategic military location in Zhejiang province, on Tuesday, killing 4,000 Japanese soldiers.

### China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Plane Not Shot At

Chongqing: Hu De, a pilot for the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC), told a United Press reporter last night that he did not believe Japanese warplanes forced a CNAC plane to land in Xufu on Tuesday afternoon and strafed it with machine guns. He pointed out that the Japanese planes only bombed the CNAC passenger plane with bombs when it was parked at Xufu Airport. Mr. Hu told a United Press reporter when he arrived at Chongqing Airport last night, "There was no machine gun fire. When we landed in Xufu, we heard that Japanese planes were very close, so we didn't have time to take off. The passengers and crew left the plane and took cover. When the Japanese planes arrived overhead, everyone was safely in their hiding places. Afterwards, the Japanese planes dropped many bombs, one of which destroyed the plane's right wing. The engine and other parts of the plane were not damaged, and only a few places were pierced by shrapnel, but it did not affect anything. The main damage was that large pieces of mud fell on the wings. There were no casualties among the passengers, and all the passengers transferred to Chengdu without incident." It is understood that one of the crew members started repairing the plane yesterday, and the plane may have already flown out. Hu De has been in China since 1933 and is very famous in China. In 1938, he was piloting a Douglas DCZ "Guilin" when it was shot down by Japanese planes in Guangdong. Several passengers were killed and injured at that time, and Mr. Hu was also injured. Mr. Hu joked to the United Press reporter, "I don't understand why this kind of thing always happens to my planes." Mr. Hu took a vacation in the United States last year and flew an American plane to England. Mr. and Mrs. Bai Lang, who were passengers on the plane, arrived in Chengdu yesterday.

Editorial

### Japan in the Question of Peace and War

All political issues, whether national or international, are often more ambiguous, different in appearance and reality, complex in form, and intertwined with fact and fiction than other types of issues. Listeners and viewers often cannot understand them clearly from the beginning, and may even end up feeling confused. However, there are often cases where one only needs to focus on one point to see through everything that seems mysterious.

According to a Washington dispatch yesterday, US Secretary of State Hull, regarding the news spread by the Soviet Union, that is, the "trial balloon" of the Sino-Japanese peace movement, which was falsely claimed as initiated by the US government, gave a clear denial. Originally, the Sino-Japanese war affects the entire world situation and has long been a matter of concern and attention to the world. Now, at a time when the Pacific Ocean is turbulent and China is expecting and receiving large-scale assistance from the United States, if the US government really launches a reconciliation between China and Japan, the Chinese National Government may not immediately waver in its belief to fight until the Japanese army completely withdraws. However, the attitude of the US government will inevitably attract the attention of the world. Therefore, what Mr. Hull denied is exactly what the world wants to hear. In fact, the US attitude is clear and firm, recognizing Japan and distrusting Japan, and has repeatedly been subjected to unceremonious accusations and uninhibited reprimands by the US government authorities. It will never take the initiative to seek compromise with Japan. Why would there be a need for Mr. Hull's denial? Rumors spread everywhere, and it is not difficult to see through their falsity. It's just a rumor, not a so-called political issue.

What is not a problem between the United States and China is indeed the only current problem in Japan. It is by no means a malicious accusation. But it can be proven by the fact that Japanese prime ministers, foreign ministers, military warlords, and even spokespersons of various relevant government departments have declared that they are eager to resolve the so-called China Incident countless times. This shows that it is an extremely urgent, large, and serious problem. Therefore, whether the Japanese side proposes conditions or applies for reconciliation, no matter under what form it is revealed, no matter how many times it has been revealed, how many times it has been publicized, or how many times it has been denied, each time it is seen by the world as having its origin and not being unexpected. Even if such experiences happen thousands of times again, the world will still view it in the same way thousands of times. Because in Japan, it is really a problem. And the trial balloon five days ago floated leisurely across the globe. When the balloon was floating leisurely, some people were half-doubting and half-believing, saying, "What will this round of peace atmosphere be like?" The result of this trial can be said to be a dim reaction. Measured against the expected reaction, the result can be said to be bad. The balloon burst. And yesterday's Tokyo dispatch, the Japanese authorities also came out with a mocking tone to deny it, saying that given the past attitude of the United States towards Japan, why would Japan make this proposal to the United States? Why bother to point out that this ridicule is a way to excuse oneself? Why bother to clarify that although the past attitude of the United States towards Japan was like this, the future attitude will still be like this? To clarify that Japan hopes to welcome Matsuoka's visit to the United States, that is, hopes to reach a compromise and so-called understanding with the United States. This attitude has not been far in Japan's past, or may not have passed yet. However, yesterday's Tokyo dispatch claiming the Japanese side's denial must be true. At least, it has been denied again this time.

Revealing, publicizing, and denying, again and again, even thousands of times, make listeners and viewers feel that they come without a trace and go without a trace, unclear and confusing. Such tireless trials are made for what? There is no other reason, only because the problem is extremely urgent, large, and serious, and its nature is "too political." Listeners and viewers, do not be dazzled by it, do not be deceived by it. Know that although the denial may be formal, no matter how responsible, the revealing and publicizing in any form are all informal and irresponsible. Therefore, the trial only shows that it is extremely boring and uncontrollable, and it is only a trial. Not only is the reaction of the trial not something it can grasp, but the trial itself is not something it can dominate. At the time of this trial, it was accompanied by a group of messages advocating peace and a group of messages advocating continued war. It can be seen that the nature is "too political" and the problem is without a master! Seeing through this point of no master, all trials are not worth paying attention to, let alone discussing and implementing the major plan of withdrawing troops and seeking peace!

Launching aggression and abandoning aggression are major changes in policy. Objectively speaking, in any country during the transition period of any policy change, the emergence of diametrically opposed views, both positive and negative, is a transitional phenomenon and a political commonplace, and there is nothing strange or surprising about it. Therefore, the current opposition between the above-mentioned two factions in Japan is not something for Japan to be ashamed of or ridiculed. There is indeed all kinds of evidence and reasons to assert that although the current Japanese Prime Minister, Konoe, has the ambition to resolve the China Incident by tying and untying the bell, he has completely failed and lost the possibility of dominating the transition. It can be asserted that during the term of Konoe, he will not be able to resolve the so-called China Incident. Seeing through this point, it can be known that the most important possible news from the Japanese side regarding the Sino-Japanese war in the future is not how to seek peace or how to fight to the death thousands of times, but rather another round of Konoe's resignation and cabinet reshuffle.

The official Central Daily News declared, "The country represented by Mr. Gauss is not an ordinary friendly country, but one of the countries with the deepest friendship with China. Mr. Gauss is also not an ordinary diplomat, but a special hero in the US diplomatic circle. At this time of unprecedented Sino-US friendship, we celebrate the appointment of Mr. Gauss as Ambassador to China and are confident that he will accomplish what his government hopes during his tenure in China. Gauss has become an important hero in the diplomatic history of China and the United States." The Army's Anti-Smuggling Daily declared, "What we hope from the United States is not necessarily to provide assistance to China, but to immediately stop transporting supplies to Japan, not to have the United States participate in the war, but to have the United States stop Japan's war of aggression. We are confident that Gauss can bring Sino-US relations to an ideal level." (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)

Chongqing: The new US Ambassador to China, Gauss, arrived here today from Hong Kong, two hours earlier than scheduled. Therefore, the welcoming plan prepared by the Chinese authorities could not be implemented. Gauss arrived by plane from China National Aviation Corporation at 6:30 am. Also coming were Lieutenant Colonel Meyal, Army Counselor, and Commander McHugh, Navy Counselor. Although representatives of many government agencies and officials had planned to go to the airport to welcome Gauss, the welcome plan could not be implemented because he arrived early. Gauss and his party went directly to the US Embassy on the south bank of the Yangtze River by small steamer at the airport. (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)

### US Assistance in Military Equipment to China Could Defeat Japan

Chongqing: The chief writer of the Ta Kung Pao wrote to the United Press today, expressing complete agreement with the letter from readers published in the newspaper yesterday, saying that "so far, US assistance to China has not been sufficient to help China launch a general counter-offensive, and the announcement of this assistance is enough to cause Japan to fight more desperately in order to overthrow China's legitimate government immediately." The Ta Kung Pao's letter said, "The method of US assistance to China and self-help is to provide China with enough military equipment and money to last for four weeks, and China can defeat Japan." (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)

Chongqing: A military spokesperson for the central authorities declined to comment on the Ta Kung Pao's published comments urging the Communist troops. He said that the Ta Kung Pao's comments could only express the newspaper's views and had nothing to do with the views of the military authorities. The above statement was issued because someone had asked the spokesperson whether the comments clearly stated that the Communist Party did not participate in the southern Shanxi war and could be regarded as disobeying orders. Someone also asked whether the highest authorities of the Chinese army had ordered the 18th Route Army to participate in the war. The spokesperson replied that he could not confirm it and needed to return to the office for research. (United Press dispatch on the 22nd)

### U.S. Navy Secretary Knox Advocates Revising the Neutrality Act. The Policy of Freedom of the Seas Must Be Restored So That American Merchant Ships Can Pass Unimpeded. Commander of the Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Hart, Continues in Office.

Washington: Navy Secretary Colonel Knox yesterday called for a revision of the "terrible Neutrality Act." Colonel Knox stated that the United States should return to the policy of freedom of the seas so that American merchant ships can sail directly to Britain and other war ports to provide aid to democratic countries. However, he declined to discuss the issue of convoys. He said that it would be "foolish" for us to advocate the adoption of a convoy system based on the effective experience of the last World War. His remarks led observers to believe that a better method than convoys might emerge. It is understood that the authorities are conducting experimental work on this matter. Colonel Knox also stated that the U.S. naval air force is being strengthened and that the Navy hopes to realize its ideal of 19,000 naval aircraft by 1943. The U.S. Navy is studying plans to build small aircraft carriers to cope with the dangers to shipping. Production Management Director Knudsen announced that the government has formally notified Ford, Boeing, Lockheed, and Douglas aircraft factories that the government will soon sign contracts with them to build heavy bombers. This is in accordance with the President's recent plan to build a large number of bombers. Following this announcement, these factories can prepare in advance. (United Press, 22nd)

Washington: Navy Secretary Colonel Knox declared here yesterday that Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, will continue in office. Knox stated, "Admiral Hart is a particularly outstanding person for the current situation, as there is a great need for experienced personnel." Knox refused to comment on whether the Far East situation is becoming more serious, nor would he comment on the Navy's plans to continue to retain senior generals who have reached retirement age. When asked if the Navy had any information about the recent collective flight of "Flying Fortress" bombers to Hawaii, Colonel Knox replied that even if he knew, he would not be at liberty to disclose it. One reporter specifically asked if Japan was aware of this flight. Knox replied, "Are the Japanese interested in this flight?" (United Press, 22nd)

New York: Last night, Hillman, Director-General of the Office of Production Management, the highest national defense agency, declared that the United States would not wait until New York and the coastal towns become a burning fire line before fighting.

### Former New Zealand Prime Minister Arrives in Honolulu En Route to the U.S. To Confer with U.S. Authorities on Trade Issues

Honolulu: Mr. Coates, the former Prime Minister of New Zealand and now a member of the War Cabinet, recently stated that New Zealand's regional waters have suffered heavy losses from a large number of German raiders, but he declined to disclose the amount of losses. He did state that the raiders are now quieter than before. Coates also stated that U.S.-made bombers have now arrived in New Zealand and began aerial patrols on Monday. It is generally expected that U.S. long-range bombers will patrol the New Zealand seas. Coates and New Zealand Land Minister Langstone are leading a group of eight New Zealanders on the Clipper to Washington. They arrived here last night. Langstone said that he would discuss trade issues with U.S. representatives, while Coates said that he was particularly concerned with military and war needs. Coates said, "I will discuss with allied people and let them know what we need," indicating that New Zealand hopes to receive U.S. aid as stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act. Coates pointed out that New Zealand's greatest contribution to the war is to provide manpower and food, and that the proportion of New Zealanders in the military is greater than any part of the British Empire. He also said that he believes that the New Zealand troops in the last European war were the best army in the world, and that the current New Zealand army is even better than before because its knowledge is more complete and it can adapt to modern warfare. Coates declined to comment on the rumor that New Zealand would send its first ambassador to the United States. Langstone, commenting on New Zealand's role in the war, said that never has a country in the world been so unified in its will and able to create a peace based on goodwill and good neighborliness as New Zealand. We will never be swayed by the threats of dictators. We realize that dictators cannot place every country under military rule, nor can they create a trade system in which all countries contribute to Germany. (United Press, 22nd)

### American Passengers on the Sessa Granted Permission by Germany to Leave France. The U.S. Consul General in Bordeaux Will Visit These Hundred-Plus Refugees.

Washington: According to reports from Vichy via Bordeaux, the German side has informed the U.S. State Department that the German naval authorities will allow the American passengers on the Egyptian merchant ship Sessa to leave France.

Berlin: Officials here today stated that the German government has now requested that governments that still have diplomatic officials stationed in Paris recall their diplomatic officials. The German government has taken this measure because the French government is now located in Vichy and not in Paris. This request has now been made to the U.S. government. At the same time, the same request has been telegraphed to countries that still have diplomatic officials stationed in Paris. (Haitong, 22nd)

### Churchill Reports on the War Situation. The Situation in Crete Is Serious. Germany Plans to Use the Italian Fleet to Attack. Britain Decides to Defend the Island's Coastline.

Cairo: The British General Headquarters issued a communiqué this afternoon stating that yesterday, multiple groups of German paratroopers and air legions continued to land in various parts of Crete. British and New Zealand troops, assisted by Greek and Cretan troops, are making every effort to annihilate them. The British army fought bravely, and three counterattacks were very successful. The enemy's losses yesterday were greater than before. By nightfall, the situation in all areas except Maleme was very successful. (Reuters, 22nd)

London: At a meeting of the House of Commons yesterday afternoon, Prime Minister Churchill reported on the latest war news from Crete, saying that at 4:40 p.m. on Tuesday, there was continued aerial attack on Suda Bay, with 3,000 paratroopers landing. By 6:30 p.m. that evening, most of the paratroopers had been dealt with. The fighting had not stopped, and by 9:00 p.m. the situation was under control. The German method of attack was to use dive bombers and Messerschmitt fighters first, followed by glider squadrons and paratrooper squads. Paratroopers in the Heraklion and Rethymno areas began their attack at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, and transport planes landed. However, many transport planes crashed. It is expected that the fighting will continue to be intense. A member asked that if German soldiers landed wearing British uniforms, how would this be dealt with in accordance with international law? The Prime Minister replied that the enemy soldiers did wear New Zealand uniforms, but in reality, the details of this matter had not been fully reported, so it would have to be handled by the local military authorities at their discretion. A communiqué from the Central Army Headquarters in Cairo on the afternoon of the 21st stated that Crete was subjected to intense aerial attacks throughout the day on Tuesday, and paratroopers and others landed in various places. There was fierce fighting all day, and the enemy suffered heavy losses, while the British suffered relatively minor losses. A German unit even broke into the outskirts of Canea, but was quickly surrounded and dealt with. The fighting is still ongoing. (Reuters, 22nd)

Cairo: According to military sources here, the two points where German paratroopers first landed on Crete at 1:00 a.m. on May 20th were Suda Bay and Maleme. Suda Bay is one of the most important British naval bases in the Eastern Mediterranean after the German invasion of Greece, and Maleme is the site of an important airfield. The Germans sent paratroopers to land after a day of heavy bombing. Shortly after, paratroopers also landed at Canea (the capital of Crete) and Heraklion on the peninsula north of Suda Bay. At 6:30 a.m. on the 20th, the bombing continued unabated, and paratroopers landed again in Heraklion and Rethymno. The fighting continued until night, and the situation was quite chaotic because many paratroopers were wearing New Zealand uniforms. The war situation on the 21st is still unknown. According to responsible parties yesterday, the claim that the enemy navy had landed on Crete is not true, but the Germans had sent small boats to attempt a landing. (Reuters, 21st)

London: British bombers have launched extensive attacks on German-occupied airfields in Greece to deter German attacks on Crete. (Reuters, 22nd)

Alexandria: Egyptian Greek expatriates were very angry to hear the news of the attack on Crete. Greeks and Cretans in Egypt unanimously stated that this action by the Germans strengthened the determination of the Greeks to fight to the end. The capture and killing of paratroopers is clear proof that aggression from the air is bound to fail. (Reuters, 22nd)

### British and Greek Troops on the Island Fight German Paratroopers in Bloody Battles

London: Determined British and Greek troops, having heard the news, separately engaged in mortal hand-to-hand combat with countless German paratroopers in mountain ridges, valleys, highlands, and beaches this morning in order to save Crete from falling into Nazi hands. Unofficial but extremely reliable sources said that the number of German soldiers landing on Crete, having been dropped by low-flying aircraft arriving in succession, may have exceeded 15,000. The Germans had apparently prepared to sacrifice the majority of their soldiers in order to seize the island, and hoped to frustrate the morale of the British and Greek troops through attacks by large numbers of aircraft and paratroopers, thereby rendering the island indefensible. According to various sources, there are still 40,000 German troops in Greece, preparing to set off to intensify their frenzied blitzkrieg and air invasion. The Germans are apparently extremely determined to drive the British out of Crete, which Prime Minister Churchill has declared he is determined to defend to the death. It is reported that British troops are resisting German troops attempting to land in small boats, and it is reported that these small boats have been driven toward the small bays and remote beaches along the northwest coast of Crete, but authoritative sources have not yet revealed what the outcome will be. The British Navy seems to be using its great power to protect the island's coastline. Military experts doubt whether the Germans can use very large ships to put pressure on the British fleet operating around Crete. However, they pointed out that the Germans have concentrated a number of small boats in the Greek coast and islands, as well as in Rhodes, which may be able to pass through the British naval defenses at night. However, the troops stationed in Crete, led by General Freyberg, have prepared to launch a head-on attack on any enemy troops attempting to land. Naval experts also warned that Hitler may use the Italian navy to assist in a certain maritime invasion, and then follow it up with German troops transported by aircraft. Naval experts believe that the Germans will probably be able to use Italian ships, and may even be able to use amphibious tanks, just as they did when crossing the Meuse River in France. However, they vehemently stated that the Germans have no such intention at this time, and believe that the British Navy will definitely be able to quickly crush this German attempt. They also pointed out that the defenders of the island have prepared to defend the coast and inland with thorough anti-tank methods. What General Freyberg is most anxious about now is that the operational convenience of British fighter planes may be lost, as it is reported that British planes are currently unable to compete with German planes in terms of numbers in terms of driving away German planes, landing soldiers, and bombing Cretan airfields, with a ratio of one to twenty-three compared to German planes. Yesterday, British and Greek troops and German troops were still engaged in a life-and-death "hide-and-seek" battle, while British troops maintained strict vigilance along the coast to prevent soldiers from the sea. As of yesterday afternoon, apart from what authoritative sources in London called a relatively small-scale attempt by German troops, there was no news of German troops landing by sea, and the one section referred to by authoritative sources cannot be considered a formal invasion. Authoritative sources pointed out that the Germans lacked tools other than smaller warships that could be used for an invasion of the Mediterranean. Therefore, their only opportunity to break through the British naval defenses may be to use the Italian fleet, which has recently been stationed in several places, and drive it to battle. As there are currently no official reports, it is generally believed that the Germans will continue their means of Tuesday, that is, using airplanes to transport troops to fight. However, regarding the actual situation in Crete, everything is not very clear except that the war has not yet reached a decisive stage. Officials also admitted that it is difficult to estimate the exact number of Germans landing on Crete, because the landing techniques of the invading troops, especially the paratroopers, are particularly good. The skies over Britain have been very still for more than ten days. People here are now speculating whether the Germans have now temporarily suspended their long-term threat of a major assault on London, and whether the bomber groups now stationed on the northern border of France will cross the Mediterranean and launch a large-scale assault on Suez. (United Press, 22nd)

Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry declined to disclose the situation of the war on Crete, only citing British reports and saying that the situation is becoming more serious. (Haitong, 22nd)

Vichy: Although the war report released by the German High Command today regarding the war on Crete did not mention a single word, in reality, large-scale warfare has been taking place on the island since yesterday morning. According to reports from London, seventy German soldiers have landed on the island by parachute. This move is one of the most important parts of the Axis military plan, and it is expected that attacks will gradually unfold in other areas at the same time. (Havas, 21st)

Stockholm: According to reports from London, the British public is watching the situation in the eastern Mediterranean. They believe that the war in the Near East may also occur in the British mainland. Therefore, the British mainland has increased anti-aircraft guns. The British public believes that the war on Crete is a major battle in the current European war, and its implications are very significant. (Haitong, 22nd)

Stockholm: The Times of London reported that if Crete falls into the hands of the enemy, the enemy will control the key to attacking Egypt, and the activities of the British Navy in the eastern Mediterranean will also be hindered. The Germans will launch a fierce attack on the island, and German planes flying to the island are closer than British planes taking off from Egypt, Cyprus, or Palestine. The German attack on the island may be carried out entirely by the air force, or may seize landing points along the coast at night. (Haitong, 22nd)

Stockholm: Six Greek cabinet members fled to Cairo before German planes bombed Crete. Well-informed sources in London confirmed this report yesterday. The British government tried to keep it secret, fearing that the news of the Greek cabinet members fleeing to Cairo would have a negative impact on British public opinion. (Haitong, 22nd)

### A Unit of French Troops in Syria Reportedly Joins de Gaulle

London: The Brazzaville radio station in Free French Equatorial Africa broadcast that there is good reason to believe that a regiment of French troops stationed in Syria has joined the Free French forces. The colonel commanding the regiment is brave and capable, and enjoys the support of the French and locals. His name has not yet been announced. Anti-Vichy sentiment is reportedly spreading in Syria.

### Fighting Continues in the Lake Region South of Addis Ababa; One Italian Brigade Commander Captured; Duke of Aosta Formally Surrenders

Cairo: British military headquarters released a communiqué yesterday afternoon stating that the Duke of Aosta, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in Abyssinia, formally surrendered on Tuesday after handing over all equipment in the Amba Alagi area, along with five generals and several senior staff officers.

### Vichy Imitates Nazis: Adopts Scuttling Policy; Shipping Department Orders All Captains to Scuttle; France Currently Has 1.5 Million Tons of Merchant Shipping

London: The Vichy government has imitated the Nazis and adopted a policy of scuttling ships. The Vichy shipping department has ordered all French ship captains to scuttle or destroy their ships if necessary to prevent them from being captured by the British authorities. This order was signed by Auphan, representing Darlan, and recently obtained by the British Ministry of Economic Warfare. It stated that failure to comply with this order would result in severe consequences for existing French transportation permits, and the captains themselves would be punished. According to responsible sources in London, the reference to permits indicates that French ships now require the permission of the Armistice Commission to sail. In fact, all French merchant ships have been chartered by the Germans. All orders issued to French merchant ships must be submitted to the Armistice Commission, so the movements of French merchant ships are controlled by the commission. In February, Vichy broadcast that it was estimated that France had a total of 2.5 million tons of merchant shipping at the time of the armistice. The British have detained 190 French ships, totaling 450,000 tons. French ships under the command of General de Gaulle total 43,000 tons. Another 57,000 tons of merchant shipping have been reported lost. At the time of the armistice, 250,000 tons of French ships were confiscated or detained by the Germans, and 170,000 tons were detained in neutral ports. From this, it can be seen that France currently has about 1.5 million tons of merchant shipping. There have been no reports of French ships being scuttled. (Reuters, 22nd)

### Hong Kong Rice Price Extremely Reasonable; Municipal Council Does Not Profit; Various Costs of Shipping from Hong Kong to Shanghai Are Very High; Wholesale Merchants' Profit Margins Are Not High Either; Rice Shops That Have Sold All Their Hong Kong Rice Should Not Deceive Customers by Leaving Up Signs

According to a statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Council has received reports of superficial criticism regarding the selling price of its foreign rice. This is likely due to comparing the retail prices of Hong Kong and Shanghai.

The current retail price in Hong Kong is equivalent to 88 Shanghai currency dollars per stone. This number must be added to shipping fees, freight charges, insurance fees, war risk fees, local unloading and storage fees, customs wharf dues, fire insurance fees, interest, and weight loss. Therefore, the Council's retail price of 110 dollars per stone provides wholesale merchants and retail rice shops with only a very reasonable profit margin. At the same time, the Council does not profit. The remaining balance of the proceeds is minimal and is used to cover various expenses related to rice transportation.

If unexpected profits are gained due to exchange rate fluctuations, these profits will be used to offset similar unexpected losses, or to achieve the Council's original intention of stabilizing the rice market and keeping rice prices at the lowest possible level.

Over 100,000 Bags of Hong Kong Rice Have Arrived

To regulate the food supply and suppress rice prices, the Shanghai Municipal Council has procured inexpensive foreign rice from Hong Kong and entrusted various rice shops throughout the city to sell it. It is reported that the total amount of this Hong Kong rice that has arrived in Shanghai, including the 10,000 bags transported by the Taishun yesterday afternoon, is 101,609 bags. Over 70,000 bags were handled by Xiangmao Foreign Company for wholesale to miscellaneous grain stores, and over 30,000 bags were directly retailed by various rice shops. All sales procedures have been completed. As for the third batch of foreign rice shipped to Shanghai, it has been loaded onto the Fusheng of Jardine Matheson & Co., and the Suzhou of Butterfield & Swire, which should arrive in port in the next couple of days.

Purchase Methods for Organizations and Factories

Since the Municipal Council lifted restrictions on the quantity of Hong Kong rice that can be purchased and allowed various organizations and factories to order it, many are purchasing it. As a result, some rice shops have sold out of Hong Kong rice and are now continuing to apply to Liji Foreign Company for orders. As for the methods for organizations and factories to purchase this Hong Kong rice, it is reported that if only a small quantity is purchased, orders can be placed directly with various rice shops. If the quantity is excessive, then application procedures must be completed, and the application is only approved after the foreign company investigates and confirms that it is for self-consumption. And each rice shop is ordered to sell the rice as requested. It is reported that many applications have been filed in recent days, and most have been approved after investigation.

Do Not Display Signs After Rice Is Sold Out

Dishonest rice merchants are selling mixed rice, attempting to undermine the authorities' plan, which is outrageous. But they even continue to embellish excuses. Yesterday, they appealed to the Rice Merchants' Association, requesting it to correct their behavior, which the association refused. The Bureau distributed hundreds of small bags of low-priced rice samples to various police stations' detectives some time ago to investigate carefully. It is reported that the dishonest merchants are using

Saigon broken rice mixed into the low-priced Hong Kong rice, ruining the quality of the Hong Kong rice. Yesterday, hundreds of small bags of Saigon broken rice samples were made again and distributed to various police stations' detectives for investigation at any time, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from using tricks. According to the person in charge of Xiangmao Foreign Company, he told a Peace Daily reporter that if the various rice shops in the district sell out of their ordered low-priced Hong Kong rice, they must quickly order from Liji, Xiangmao, and the 17 designated miscellaneous grain stores such as Tairun.

They cannot sell other types of rice to fill the order, so as not to repeat the mistake of Yongchang Rice Shop. After Yongchang Rice Shop was punished by being suspended from the right to retail Municipal Council foreign rice, the owner of the rice shop, Zhao Junsun, went to Xiangmao Foreign Company to explain yesterday morning. He claimed that his shop had sold out of Municipal Council foreign rice, so he sold other types of foreign rice to the citizens. However, the Western police officer believes that since the shop no longer has Municipal Council foreign rice for sale, it

should not display a wooden sign stating "This store sells Municipal Council foreign rice". Therefore, it is believed that the shop has a suspicion of deceiving customers. It is reported that Xiangmao Foreign Company has reported the details of the incident to the authorities for judgment. Furthermore, Fan Shujiu of Shichangyi Rice Shop at No. 225 Jiaxiyi Road, French Concession, wrote yesterday stating that the report that he was had his license revoked for selling mixed Hong Kong rice was untrue.

Pay Attention to Rickshaws Transporting Rice

Around 3 PM the day before yesterday, a Chinese policeman from the Shanzhong Road police station saw a rickshaw carrying six bags of rice while on duty. He went forward to question the driver and learned that the rice was sent by the Yihe Rice Shop at the intersection of Baer Road and Wangzhi Road. However, since this rice was a low-priced rice of the Municipal Council, it was not allowed to be transported in such large quantities by rickshaw. He immediately brought the rickshaw and the driver back to the police station, confiscated the rice and the rickshaw, and severely punished the driver.

### Colonel Baker to Leave Shanghai Tomorrow Evening

Colonel Baker, commander of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment in Shanghai, succeeded Colonel Fagan as commander here, and has been in Shanghai since February of last year, which is exactly one year.

New York newspapers called him "the protector of the American outpost in the Far East".

### Draft Electricity Restriction Measures; Users Allowed to Object; Implementation Depends on Fuel Situation; Electricity Surcharge Increased Again This Term

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that it has received the report of the Special Committee on the Study of Electricity Supply Restrictions and published it as a Special Gazette on the 17th of this month.

And users who wish to make a personal presentation of their views will have the opportunity to present them to the Special Committee.

Personal Presentation of Appeals

### San Francisco Shortwave Radio Station Broadcasts Chinese Programs, Named "China Good Neighbor Time," Shanghai Can Listen at 5 PM

According to news from San Francisco, the KGEI shortwave radio station in the Chinatown central district of that city, which was established by General Electric Company, has strong broadcasting power. It now broadcasts special programs to Asia every night, named "China Good Neighbor Time." The program is broadcast exclusively in Mandarin and Cantonese, using accurate world news and the best Chinese opera and music. For special events, such as the Chinese New Year and the Rice Bowl Movement, Chinese reporters bring recording equipment to the liveliest places to broadcast the current events.

Establishing Friendship Among Overseas Chinese

KGEI radio station is the first to broadcast Chinese-language programs from a radio station outside of China. The radio station is located in San Francisco, where the most overseas Chinese live on the North American continent. Therefore, it can add this special program. Its purpose is to establish contact and harmony between overseas Chinese in the United States and overseas Chinese in Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippines, East India, and Asia.

Extremely Clear Reception in the East

Because the radio station is on the west coast of the United States, only this radio station's broadcast can be clearly heard in the East. Other shortwave radio stations in the United States are all east of the Mississippi River, broadcasting directly to Europe and Latin America. "China Good Neighbor Time" broadcasts programs from midnight to 1:00 AM (Shanghai summer time 5 to 6 PM). The frequency is 9670. The director is Mr. Huang, a Chinese businessman leader in Oakland, California. The technical supervisor is Mr. Tang of the Kingstar Radio Company. The China Six Company and its Director Mr. Feng are also actively cooperating. Mr. Feng recently flew to Chongqing and has just returned to San Francisco.

Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Sent a Congratulatory Telegram

When the "China Good Neighbor Time" program was broadcast for the first time at midnight on April 19, a grand ceremony was held, and congratulatory telegrams from US President Roosevelt, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and dignitaries from the government and the public were read out. The Chinese Ambassador to the United States entrusted the Chinese Consul General in San Francisco (C.T. Feng) to represent him at the event. Two Chinese singers who recently arrived in the United States also flew from New York to San Francisco to participate in the first broadcast program. The musicians were the Chinese orchestra from the Chinese Theatre in San Francisco.

### Dance Hall Business Is Booming, Difficult to Break the Record, Total of 270,000 Yuan Received

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association previously established a refugee factory to raise funds. Therefore, the dance hall group asked various dance halls to make slight relief donations from the dancers. Dance halls with dance prices within 1.5 yuan were classified as Class A dance halls, and each dancer donated 10 cents. Dance halls with dance prices above 1.5 yuan were classified as Class B dance halls, and each dancer was charged 5 cents. Since its implementation, it has been two years and three months, with an average monthly income of about 10,000 yuan. In 27 months, 270,000 yuan has been received. This amount will be used as the refugee factory fund, and it will be established as soon as the funds are collected. In April, due to the warm weather, it was very suitable for dancing, so the number of tourists in the dance halls increased sharply, and business was particularly prosperous. The relief donation income also broke past records. In one month, a total of 11,499.7 yuan was received, an increase of about 1,700 to 1,800 yuan compared to previous months.

### Paint Workers' Strike Causes More Disputes

The Shanghai Paint Industry Workers' Union has repeatedly consulted with Mr. Ni Fusheng and Mr. Lü Chunshan, those in charge of the Trade Association, regarding the increase in workers' meal wages. On the 4th of this month, the two parties agreed that an increase of 1 yuan in meal wages would be implemented starting on the 16th, and Mr. Ni Fusheng and others in charge of the Trade Association signed and sealed the agreement as proof. This had already been announced. However, the Trade Association published a notice on the 22nd, overturning the previous agreement, which led to a labor strike. It is reported that the relevant parties have been urged to mediate in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible.

### More Than a Year of Litigation, Stock Disputes Resolved, Both Parties Withdraw Litigation After Mediation

The case of stock trading disputes between Zhongyong Foreign Firm and Hu Gengfu in this city has now been resolved.

Therefore, the firm believed that it was Hu Gengfu's account and sued him for repayment, leading to more than a year of litigation.

This dispute, which spanned a year, has now been resolved.

Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 89.4 degrees and the lowest was 63.5 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 81.9 degrees and the lowest was 58.8 degrees.

### Orphan's Paradise (4) Willow

Also due to the shadow of war, medical treatment is not as good as before. And prices are soaring wildly due to speculation and hoarding; especially rice and coal, consumption remains unchanged, and prices have risen more than ten times compared to before, with fixed funding income, to cope with the ever-changing and rising prices, it suddenly made the daily life of 368 orphans face extremely serious difficulties. Not to mention the single item of rice, each time needing two and a half stones of rice, at 100 yuan per stone, each day needs 350 yuan, each month needs 10,500 yuan, each year needs 126,000 yuan, plus fuel, water, electricity, vegetables, shoes, socks, clothing, and pocket money, which one can be said to be less, each must be provided by the hospital, imagine the annual expenditure expansion, income reduction, under this kind of deficit state, the perseverance and effort of the hosts is really admirable to the extreme.

However, I think that the charitable nature of people in Shanghai society is also not small; without seeing that the funds of the New Universal Nursery have been exhausted to the extreme, and after this newspaper constantly appealed for it, it has gained great sympathy from society, and has had very large gains, according to the funds received from all parties, it is close to a number of 100,000 yuan. With the 86-year history of the Tushan Bay Orphanage, it has the most perfect equipment and has raised more than 5,500 orphans. In addition, the Catholic priests do not emphasize propaganda, but only know how to work, it is really a well-deserved practical work. Also, in order to be self-sufficient in peacetime and not solicit donations from society, people in society are also indifferent. Now, due to the continuous war, it has gradually felt the difficult situation, so that this paradise for orphans can get through this difficult time and step into Kangzhuang, this is not the responsibility of the hosts of the orphanage and the Catholics, but the responsibility that everyone in the whole society should have, because the common education of orphans is not only to serve for Catholicism, but also to serve the whole society, so the responsibility of maintaining it should also be borne by the whole society.

The facts are like this, and cannot be erased, their crafts are hoping that people in society will visit, and can accept all kinds of daily utensils and everything that the outside world cannot undertake in art and crafts, everyone thinks, this is also a kind of expression of the orphanage's most successful management.

We visited and came out, left the orphanage, and returned with Mr. Zhi Yao in the same car, remembering the most sincere French appeal that Father Zhang wrote for us to see, the original text is:

Tout　ctient　est　unbienfaiteur　de　I'orphelinat

Although I have studied French for a year, it was 30 years ago, and I have already returned it to Mr. Zhao Zhiyou? Now I only remember that the Chinese translation of this sentence is:

"Whoever buys orphan products is the benefactor of the orphan!"

I think this is the most convenient relief! Buying things can relieve people, there are many rich people in Shanghai, it is really a benevolent and inexpensive thing. Moreover, the products of the orphanage are not for the purpose of making profit, but are guaranteed by reputation, and they can really afford the four words "genuine goods at a fair price", so why not do it?

### Food: Rice Merchants' Ambitions Are Difficult to Suppress, Always Thinking of Moving

The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice continues to arrive in port. Jardine Matheson's Taisheng ship, loaded with 10,000 bags from Hong Kong, arrived in Shanghai at about 2:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition to carrying 10,000 bags of foreign rice for the Shanghai Municipal Council, the ship also carried 1,000 bags of flour. (Zu)

Yesterday's foreign rice market changed from a drop to a rise. The selling prices of both forward and spot were initially low and then high, and the final results were two or three yuan better than the day before. Early morning sales were weak, but current inventories are gradually increasing. There are also continuous deliveries of public sale rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council. Orders for April and May will arrive one after another. People's hearts are weakening, and rice prices are consistently going down. Later, because the negotiated price of 1,000 tons of broken grains for foreign merchants failed to reach an agreement, it again attracted the attention of scattered speculative households. Spot sales also slightly increased. Sellers took the opportunity to defend, and prices rose again gradually. Broken grains rebounded from the lowest price of 105 yuan to 109 yuan. Saigon No. 1 was 112 yuan to 114 yuan, Min Dang high grade was 108 yuan, general grade was 106 or 107 yuan. Only the lower-grade goods, Saigon No. 2 and Siamese Saigon, were more thoroughly sold at the lower prices of the past, and the tastes of the local people were suitable, so the route suddenly became lively, with an increase of more than two yuan. Saigon No. 2 opened at 107 yuan, 106 yuan half, Siamese No. 2 from 104 yuan, sharp tip 99 yuan half, then to 103 yuan half. As for the broken tip high-grade goods, the sales are quite smooth, opening at 86 yuan, there is little change compared to the decisive price, opening at 84 or 5 yuan, deciding to 81 yuan half. Yinghua Company also rebounded at the same time, the April-May broken grain from 128 yuan to 129 yuan half, Saigon No. 1 from 134 yuan to 136 yuan, broken rice from 95 yuan to 97 yuan. The total market traded 800 tons of Yinghua Company and more than 10,000 bags of spot rice.

Thick and thin japonica rice and other types of rice arrived yesterday, totaling more than 400 stones. Sellers wanted to defend the price, but it was not effective, and the result was a stable situation. Wuxi fresh japonica rice opened at 132 or 3 yuan, Kunshan fresh japonica rice opened at 130 yuan, the general market was 118 yuan to 116 yuan, Nangang early and late rice was fresh at 127 or 8 yuan, the next day to 122 yuan half, original package at 127 or 8 yuan. The supply and demand of glutinous rice was similar, with no significant difference. Hong Kong white ordinary goods opened at 110 yuan, 109 yuan, but special goods were very rare on the market and were quite sought-after, making up to 114 yuan. Zhongguan national glutinous rice also opened at 114 yuan.

Flour Market Hovers

Yesterday's flour market continued to hover. Because of the continuous decline, many speculative stocks had been mostly sold off. Major firms were not eager to sell. New wheat will be on the market soon, and people's hearts are not good. The general market opened with Huawu brand Australian flour (Bank Stack) at 29 yuan 6 cents, Golden Dragon flour at 29 yuan, Fortress flour at 29 yuan 5 cents, and Green Treasure flour at 28 yuan. More than 20,000 bags were traded. Muji Street handled more than 10,000 bags, and the rest were purchased by customers. The flat-priced flour from Chinese factories was still 29 yuan, with little change for the time being. The retail price of flour on the market was as high as 31 or 2 yuan, with very high profits, not related to the official market, and there was a lack of regulation, so they did whatever they wanted.

Wheat was stagnant as usual. All factories are waiting for the new wheat to be on the market before buying again, so the supply and demand of old wheat has long been quiet. The current market price is at 45 or 6 yuan, but there is no formal trading.

Oil Cakes and Corn Sold to the Interior

Yesterday's miscellaneous grain and oil cake market lacked new stimulus, so there was little exciting performance on both sides of the trade. The market was quite lively. Under the concept of different long and short positions, the pulling and resistance forces were evenly matched, so the overall situation turned into a roundabout trend. Statistics show that 160 or 70 loads of soybean oil were traded, more than 2,000 bags of various soybeans, and more than 3,000 bags of corn (sold to Yantai in the interior). More than 30,000 pieces of forward and spot soybean cakes were traded. Forward cakes were used as bargaining chips, while spot cakes were for the interior. Today, 480 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Finance Speculation on Foreign Exchange Returns Vigorously; British and American Banks Show Strong Appetite

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listed exchange rates. However, the black market exchange rates for British and American currencies tended to loosen and depreciate, causing the price of gold to plummet to below 6,400 yuan. Speculators initially retreated slightly but then returned vigorously. The US dollar was firm at 5.4375 yuan at noon, while the British pound softened to 3 shillings and 3.125 pence. This was due to a certain American bank solely purchasing 100,000 US dollars, which then stabilized the market slightly. In the afternoon, rumors spread that Japan would actively advance southward and that the US Congress had passed the cancellation of the Neutrality Act. Chinese speculators aggressively sold, but the British and American banks did not show weakness in their appetite for purchases. Consequently, the market did not loosen and remained relatively stable. The final gains for the day were 1.5615 for the British pound and 0.02125 for the US dollar, resulting in extremely active trading.

US Dollar Rises to 4375

According to morning foreign telegraphic reports on the silver market, both the large bars and the American silver were level. Indian silver depreciated again. Exchange rates in various countries showed a slight decrease of one point against Shanghai, with the rest remaining level. Central Bank listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Domestic spot prices opened level with bank selling prices. The British exchange rate was 2.96875 shillings per ounce, and the US dollar was 5.375 yuan. After the opening, speculators continued the previous day's buying spree, settling 10,000 US dollars for June at a price of 5.40625 yuan. Foreign banks continued to supply, causing the market to harden. The HSBC listed exchange rates remained unchanged. After the silver equalization tax remained at 24.25%, speculators adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and bank transactions were scarce, indicating stability. Near noon, speculators suddenly aggressively sold June US dollars at 5.4375 yuan, with Citibank alone purchasing 100,000 US dollars. American banks also absorbed some supply, and the market stabilized at noon. The US dollar closed at 5.40625 yuan at noon, and the British pound also hardened to 3 shillings and 3.125 pence. In the afternoon, speculators continued to aggressively sell June US dollars at 5.4375 yuan, with more negative rumors circulating. However, foreign British and American banks were still interested in buying, keeping the situation relatively stable. Until the 4 pm close, spot and June futures were both 2 shillings and 3.125 pence for the British pound and 5.40625 yuan for the US dollar, which were gains of 0.015625 for the British pound and 0.03125 for the US dollar compared to the previous day's noon closing price.

Gold Market Futures and Spot Prices Diverge

Yesterday's gold market, after initially fluctuating on the black market, suddenly declined again, with prices falling back below the 6,400 yuan level, which was quite unexpected. The sentiment of all parties, which had turned firm the previous day, became weak again. This was because the foreign exchange market suddenly tended to loosen due to improved bank selling sentiment. Securities firms resumed their activities, with Huipiao merchants Xinfengyong continuing to emerge. Under the pressure of selling, the price fell from 6,417 yuan in the morning to 6,357 yuan, which was resisted by the gold firms. The price rose slightly. In the early afternoon, the market was very stable. However, news of a sudden sharp drop in foreign stocks caused negative rumors, including that the US Congress had passed the cancellation of the Neutrality Act and that Japan would soon advance southward. Amidst sparse trading, Yiyuan and Gonghe competed to sell, pushing the price down to a low of 6,348 yuan. However, the foreign exchange market did not loosen accordingly. Securities firm Defu aggressively bought, raising the price by 30 to 40 yuan. The market closed with a small gain of 32 yuan. Total trading volume was 50,000 to 60,000 taels. Swaps (May rolling into June) were initially offered at a premium of 75 yuan by sellers, later narrowing to 70 yuan. In the afternoon, buyers offered a premium of 78 yuan, with some transactions occurring. For cash, Qingtai sold 50 taels to Chengji, and Taikangrun sold 100 taels, and Yifeng sold 50 taels, which were bought by Zhongyu and Xintianbao. The prices were all 310 yuan higher than the futures price. At noon, Chengji further bought 10 taels from Yifeng at a price 340 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Taikangrun sold 90 taels to Chengji at a price 330 yuan higher. Shunyuan and Xinyuan each sold 10 taels at a price 335 yuan higher, and Hesheng sold 30 taels at a price 340 yuan higher, all of which were bought by Shihe. This was an increase of approximately 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Jewelry gold also rose by 5 yuan, to 695 yuan. Guan Jin, etc. remained level.

### Futures Fall Back 32 Yuan

The June futures opened at 6,415 yuan per bar (ten taels) at 9:15 am, a decrease of 2 yuan. The price rose to 6,417 yuan, but upon hearing that June US dollars could be settled at 5.40625 yuan, sentiment, which was already uncertain, softened. Hengji, Xiangyu Yong, Xinfengyong, Defu, and Tongkangyong aggressively sold, causing the price to fall by over 30 yuan to below 6,400 yuan, retreating to 6,372 yuan. Xinyuan, Defu, and Chengji aggressively bought, pushing the market up to 6,392 yuan after 10 am. Soon after, the foreign exchange market loosened again, and securities firms Tongkangyong, Defu, Chida, Jufengyong, and Xinfengyong sold, causing the market to fall by over 30 yuan, dropping to 6,357 yuan. Chengji and Yiyuan bought, raising the price by over ten yuan, and the market closed at 6,375 yuan at noon. The market opened at 6,370 yuan at 2 pm. Afterwards, supply and demand were scarce, and price fluctuations were narrow, retreating from 6,376 yuan to 67 yuan, and then rising twice to 80 yuan. After 3 pm, negative rumors suddenly arose, and Gonghe and Yiyuan aggressively sold, causing the market to plummet by over 30 yuan, dropping to 6,348 yuan. Defu, Shunyuan, Rencheng Yong, and Xinfengyong bought, pushing the market up again to 6,386 yuan. The market closed at 6,385 yuan at 4 pm, a decrease of 32 yuan compared to the previous day's noon closing price. Based on the settlement price of June US dollars at 5.40625 yuan, the implied gold price was 6,441.62 yuan, a premium of 56.62 yuan. The price rose to 6,390 yuan after the close, and finally to 85-87 yuan. There was a difference of 69 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold by reputable firms was 350 yuan higher than the hot red futures price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for current mark gold.

### Jewelry Gold Rises 5 Yuan Alone

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael by Datonghang and Xintonghang initially listed at 690 yuan, rising by 5 yuan at 4 pm, to 695 yuan, with the buying price reduced by 40 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Do Not Escape Stable Situation

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the hot red market price break into the 400 yuan level again, causing both the British pound and gold pound to fall by one yuan. British gold tickets remained stagnant as before, with the market price holding steady. US dollar tickets once retreated to 0.08 points, but eventually closed at 18.15 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.08 points compared to the previous day. Hong Kong tickets had even supply and demand, with the market price holding steady. The decline in Japanese gold tickets has already stopped, and the evening market remained at the original level of 2.04 yuan. Korean tickets tended to decrease, with the evening market retreating to 1.72 yuan.

### Securities: London Foreign Debt Mixed, Domestic Debt Situation Slightly Firm

Public Price Black Market: Yesterday, sentiment was relatively strong, with slight adjustments to cover short positions, but trading did not improve significantly. In the morning, Yitai bought, and Datong Dechang also bought a significant amount. Lianhe, Jiufu, and Changkang sold, and the market price showed signs of firming. In the afternoon, Yitai suddenly turned to selling again, and Lianhe also disposed of some holdings, with the two firms selling approximately 500,000 yuan, which were completely absorbed by Tiansheng, Hongda, and Qianyi. The price was even firmer than in the morning, eventually rising back by 0.051 to 0.25, with a trading volume of 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Trading: A hundred shares of China First Trust Company were traded at a price of 19.25 yuan.

There was still little improvement in the public industrial stock market. The downward trend expanded before the afternoon close, and the trading volume was higher than before.

London, 21st (Wednesday) Telegram: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks showed a mixed trend, with varying increases and decreases.

### Yarn and Cotton: Heavy Pressure on Yarn Market, 400 Yuan Level Almost Broken

The yarn market, which had been rising together for ten days, suddenly declined yesterday, with a trend as chaotic as hemp. Recently, the short side has been strong, with numerous rumors. At the same time, all the bullish announcements come from the short side. However, the large traders and buyers with significant capital remained firm, rolling their acquired positions daily without any intention of closing out. As for the general outsiders, their intention to short was strong, resulting in heavy pressure. In the morning, the 20s Double Horse narrowly escaped breaking the 400 yuan level. It is said that a certain group has already shifted from short to long, leading to a slight rebound, but sales remain sluggish. The high price for 20s Double Horse was 1,436 yuan, and the low price was 1,402 yuan. In the early afternoon, the price was 1,416 yuan, but due to active short selling, it fell to 1,402 yuan. However, a certain large trader continued to buy, pushing the price back up to 1,409 yuan. Finally, news of a rebound in the gold price boosted sentiment, raising the price to 1,418 yuan. Trading was exceptionally active in the afternoon, reflecting the intense speculation among traders. 490 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today.

Double Horse opened in the morning, and due to the weakening momentum of the previous afternoon, the market continued to be weak. The opening price was 1,435 yuan, briefly rising to 1,436 yuan. However, as soon as this price opened, sellers rushed in, causing the price to fall to 1,415 yuan. Subsequently, those who profited covered their short positions, causing the market to rebound to 1,423 yuan. After 11:30 am, upon hearing that spot yarn trading was weak and that foreign exchange was loosening, and mark gold was declining, sentiment suddenly turned weak, and selling resumed, falling directly to 1,402 yuan. At this time, the selling pressure was overwhelming, but a portion of traders took advantage of the weakness to buy, pushing the market back up to 1,410 yuan at closing. Total trading volume for the half-day was 17,050 bales, including 50 bales by Hong Kong firms and 17,000 bales by local firms.

### Indian Cotton Arrived Yesterday: 879 Bales

Spot cotton trading remains quiet, but sentiment remains calm. However, the factories' needs remain restrained. Nevertheless, foreign cotton trends are firm and rising, so the situation can still be maintained. Taicang flower is priced at 215 yuan.

Foreign Cotton Trading by Foreign Firms: Because international conditions are unpredictable, and at the same time, spot yarn prices are gradually declining, both domestic and foreign cotton spinning mills have no intention of purchasing. Yesterday, apart from a resale of 300 bales of Brazilian cotton among peers at a price of 406 yuan, there was nothing else to report.

Indian cotton transshipped from Hong Kong: The Shanghai-India shipping route, after the expansion of the European war, saw the British company's ships requisitioned by the Admiralty, resulting in a shortage of vessels and the suspension of service. However, the Hong Kong-India route continued to operate, so Indian cotton could not be shipped directly to Shanghai, but could only be transported from Bombay or Calcutta to Hong Kong and then transshipped to Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Taishang Wheel, carrying 879 bales of Indian cotton from Hong Kong, arrived in port yesterday afternoon and was unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf.

The New York cotton market was quite lively and firm, due to buying by peers and the renewed freeze in Washington, and the increase in government lending. As a result, the closing price rose by 8 points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering and purchases by European exporters, but subsequently fell back due to selling by speculators and profit-taking by longs. Yesterday's closing prices varied by about one rupee. The forecast for today's opening is a slight decline of one rupee.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Sales Stagnant

The factory cloth market was dull yesterday, with selling prices continuing to decline. This was due to heavy selling pressure and hesitant buyers. As a result, white goods, fine cloth, and twill fell by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan per piece, while coarse cloth fell by approximately 0.25 yuan. There was no formal market price for bleached and dyed cloth, and prices were very chaotic. Local street transactions involved over 200 pieces of various cloths, with fellow traders absorbing some at low prices. Sales to customers were stagnant. Shandong firms handled over 100 pieces of bleached cloth, dyed cloth, etc., and Guangdong/Nanyang firms handled over 300 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, bleached, dyed, and printed cloth. 510 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong today.

Due to continued sluggish sales of East cloth, the selling pressure from both inside and outside the industry was particularly strong, leading to a sharp decline. The futures price of Longtou fine cloth, a white good, fell sharply by 1.56 yuan per piece, and the factory order fell by around 1 yuan. The afternoon closing price was 45.8 yuan. The factory order for the Four Gentlemen serge, a colored good, fell by 3.5 fen per yard, and the closing price was 1.4 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Futures Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to rise. The guild quoted a price of 106 yuan for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar ex-warehouse and 103.5 yuan for goods arriving in January. Futures for settlement at the end of this month opened at 107-108 yuan, closing back down to 106.3 yuan, an increase of 1.2 yuan. Futures for settlement on the 10th of next month were 107.5-108 yuan, closing at 107 yuan, with an equal increase. Taikoo granulated white B mark, Western warehouse, was 108-108.5 yuan, Eastern warehouse, 108.5 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan. DY mark, bagged, was 99 yuan, and provincial packed, 100 yuan, also an increase of 1 yuan. The rest were lacking market activity.

### Coal: Longtan Powder New: —Over Three Thousand Tons—

Although the price of dust coal has recently been declining, a large batch of lower-grade goods is on the way and arriving continuously. Yesterday, a certain firm again shipped 3,000 tons of Longtan powder from inland, which has already arrived. To cope with the declining prices, they have to reduce prices for quick sales. Among the traders, the asking price for wharf goods is 110 yuan per ton, but in this slow selling season, high-grade goods are immobile, and lower-grade goods are also difficult to move, so transactions are few and far between, and no one is interested.

Hardware: Rebar Situation Turns

Black iron billets were previously sluggish due to slow sales and abundant inventory. Recently, local billet manufacturers, iron printing factories, and machinery manufacturers have started purchasing, and the situation is gradually turning around. Traders' sentiment is also firm, and asking prices have risen back up. Yesterday, the asking price per bundle was 3,300 yuan, an increase of 40 to 50 yuan compared to before. Total transactions for the city were approximately 30 to 40 bundles.

### Banks (2)

The Ministry of Revenue replied:

"The China General Commercial Bank is to be granted a loan of one million taels of government silver by the Ministry, with interest calculated annually... Currently, the branch offices in various places are just beginning operations. To immediately order all customs offices in each province to deposit and remit official funds to the said bank, which is not trusted by all, would be difficult to enforce and might appear to be monopolistic, obstructing commercial transactions in the market. However, if the official funds deposited and remitted by the customs offices in each province, as stated in the original memorial, are to be exclusively entrusted to private silver firms without any involvement with the bank, then the government-established bank will not be trusted by the government itself. How can it be expected that merchants and civilians will trust it? This is not in line with the state's intention to maintain banks and promote commerce... It is proposed that the provinces be instructed that, in the future, in places where there is a General Commercial Bank, the remittance of all official funds should be entrusted to the General Commercial Bank for prudent handling, provided that it is verified that this will not result in losses and that remittance fees can be reduced."

From these two paragraphs, it is important to note that (1) the term "Chinese Bank" is used in contrast to "Western Bank," referring to a bank established by Chinese, not like the current Bank of China, which uses China as its name. (2) Sheng Xuanhuai's appointment as Director-General of Railways was after August of the 22nd year of Guangxu, and Sheng Xuanhuai's memorandum was even later. Therefore, the initiation of the China General Commercial Bank was in the 22nd year of Guangxu, and the commencement of operations was in April of the 23rd year of Guangxu, but it is mistaken to say that it was established in the 22nd year. (3) The term "General Commercial Bank" was a common term at the time. For example, in the memorial of Shengjing General Yiketang'a in the 24th year of Guangxu, asking to issue paper currency, it also mentioned assigning the issuance of banknotes to the bank, and stated, "At various ports, funds will be raised by the Customs Daotai to establish a General Commercial Bank," indicating that the intention to establish banks at the time was related to commerce. Therefore, Sheng used this name for his bank. (4) The Ministry of Revenue's unwillingness to entrust the depositing and remitting of official funds from the provinces and customs offices to the General Commercial Bank laid the foundation for the later establishment of the Ministry of Revenue Bank.

The issuance of banknotes by the General Commercial Bank is also mentioned in the Ministry of Revenue's reply to Shengjing General Yiketang'a's memorial asking to issue paper currency, which states:

"In the 22nd year of Guangxu, Sheng Xuanhuai requested to first establish a Chinese Bank in Beijing and Shanghai, with branch offices established in provincial capitals and ports. The bank would be managed by merchants and directors, and silver notes would be printed to circulate alongside silver. He would be responsible for raising capital jointly to establish the bank, and would be granted one million taels of official funds as an incentive. It is now requested that Sheng Xuanhuai be ordered to investigate the measures proposed by the Shanghai bank since its establishment that would be sufficient to recover economic rights and report them in detail for further consideration."

Jingwu Table Tennis Finals Scheduled for the 25th

The Jingwu Cup 4th Annual Table Tennis Championship, organized by the Jingwu Athletic Association, is scheduled for the grand finals on the 25th of this month (Sunday) at 9:30 AM (new time) at the Daxin Ballroom on Yuqiaqing Road. This year's cup competition has been recognized by the Shanghai Table Tennis Association as the Shanghai Table Tennis Player of the Year competition. The ten group championships are mainly contested by the top three strong teams in Shanghai. Although it is directly an individual championship, it indirectly relates to the reputation of each team, so the competition is fierce. Unexpected upsets have occurred repeatedly. Xue Xuchu has won all eight matches, with only the final match against Lu Hanjun remaining. The former is a rising star from Huayi, and the championship seems within reach. The latter is a pillar of Qingyun and has won the cup twice. To maintain personal honor, he will fight to the death. Wang Jiuqing has only lost one match and originally had hopes for second place. If Lu Hanjun can beat Xue Xuchu, then Xue and Wang will face off in a close battle, and it is uncertain who will win. Ouyang Wei, a strong player from overseas, has the demeanor of a great general, not arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat. Although he has four wins and three losses, he is still willing to give it his all. Others such as Chuan Qifang, Zhang Zhihong, Yang Zhaoxiang, and Wang Huizhang are evenly matched. It is reported that tickets are available in two denominations, one yuan and two yuan. The two-yuan tickets are for reserved seating and are already on sale at the association.

Chinese-Western Cup Women's Table Tennis Tournament: Women's Youth Team Defeats Jewish Team; Perennial Champions Suffer a Narrow Loss; Hualian Women Have a Good Chance of Winning

In the Chinese-Western Cup Table Tennis Tournament, the Women's Youth Team once again faced the perennial champions, the Jewish team, at the auditorium of the Women's Youth Association the night before last. Besides Zhang Jiazhen, the other four players, Fang Xiuwen, Hu Jiahe, Xu Ruilan, and Zhang Dexin, are all outstanding students of the veteran table tennis player Mr. Chen Linsheng. Their skills are extraordinary. In the first round, the Women's Youth Team was defeated by the Jewish team due to incomplete personnel. This second encounter was a battle between rivals. Under the leadership of Mrs. Difey, the latter had been invincible since the start of the tournament. Moreover, due to Hualian's withdrawal last time, they were almost certain to win this year's championship. Hualian was only one point behind, so their hope of winning the championship rested on the Women's Youth Team's match against the Jewish team. The serious nature of the match was related to international honor, so both sides went all out to compete. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. In the four rounds, they tied each other ten times. At the start of the final round, Mrs. Difey relied on the spin of her chopping technique to defeat Zhang Jiazhen of the Women's Youth Team. Jewish newcomer Su Lun defeated Zhang Dexin, giving them an absolute advantage with a score of 12-10. If the Women's Youth Team lost another match, all their efforts would be in vain. Unexpectedly, Xu Ruilan of the Women's Youth Team performed exceptionally well, winning a point against Miss Newman of the Jewish team. Hu Jiahe continued the momentum and defeated Hai Xutuo, bringing the Women's Youth Team back to a tie of 12-12. The final game was the focus of the outcome for both sides. Miss Fang Xiuwen of the Women's Youth Team relied on her bold and powerful strokes, which were accurate and effective, and she became more courageous as she fought. In the end, Fang lived up to expectations, defeating Liu Fan 21-16. The entire team finally defeated the Jewish team 13-12. Not only did they avenge their previous defeat, but they also created hope for Hualian to win the championship. It is reported that Hualian and the Jewish team have decided to hold a championship match next Friday. It is expected that Hualian can retain the championship, which is truly an honor for the Chinese people. The results of the two teams are as follows:

Women's Youth Wins/Losses Jewish Wins/Losses

Zhang Dexin 1 4 Mrs. Difey 5 0

Xu Ruilan 3 2 Su Lun 4 1

Hu Jiahe 3 2 Newman 1 4

Fang Xiuwen 3 2 Hai Xutuo 1 4

Study Guidance

### How to Study Painting (4) By Shi Chongpeng

4.  The Theory of Painting

The methods of studying Chinese and Western painting are different, and there are also great differences in theory. Now I will explain them separately to help comrades who are learning painting to gain a deeper understanding. The theory of Chinese painting is very mysterious, and there are many viewpoints. Among them, the most powerful and straightforward is Xie He's Six Principles from the Southern Qi Dynasty: 1. Qi Yun Sheng Dong (Spirit Resonance, or Vitality), 2. Gu Fa Yong Bi (Structural Method in Using the Brush), 3. Ying Wu Xiang Xing (Resemblance to the Object), 4. Sui Lei Fu Cai (Suitability in Applying Colors), 5. Jing Ying Wei Zhi (Planning and Composition), 6. Zhuan Yi Mo Xie (Transmission by Copying). The first principle, Qi Yun Sheng Dong, belongs to the spiritual realm, because painting without spirit is like a human being or animal without life, unable to live. The second principle, Gu Fa Yong Bi, is about the lines used in brushwork, which are used to depict and assemble. It is also a very important element in Chinese painting. The third principle, Ying Wu Xiang Xing, is about outlining the shape of objects. However, the outlining here is not like Western painting's focus on light and shadow, perspective, but rather capturing the general appearance of the object, with plenty of room for stretching and transformation. The fourth principle, Sui Lei Fu Cai, is about the application of color. The use of color is not a crucial issue in Chinese painting. There are many paintings that only use ink to express themselves, without borrowing the embellishment of color, and still possess a unique charm. Different shades of color are distinguished within the simple ink color, which is called "ink dividing into five colors." The fifth principle, Jing Ying Wei Zhi, is about composition. Composition occupies a very important position in Chinese painting. Although Chinese painting also applies the "Ying Wu Xiang Xing" method of sketching from life, the composition and arrangement on the canvas must have sufficient changes and careful planning, what is called "having bamboo in the chest," one more stroke is too much, one less stroke is too little, it is very subtle, so that the picture achieves the most beautiful state. The sixth principle, Zhuan Yi Mo Xie, is about copying existing paintings. As mentioned earlier, Chinese painting requires starting with copying. Without proper copying, one cannot engage in Chinese painting, especially the masterpieces of the ancients, which must be copied. However, one should not simply copy blindly. Blind copying not only does not bring benefits but also fosters laziness and a lack of creativity. In general, people often have doubts about Chinese painting. By studying the Six Principles, we can understand it clearly.

Random Notes

### Another World: Unable to Eat

— Jian

"Master, Madam, come down for dinner."

"Young Master, Miss, come down for dinner."

The old nanny called loudly from downstairs.

Those upstairs heard these four calls and slowly walked downstairs.

The ten-year-old little brother was the first to dash down, but he quickly came back up.

"Why are you coming back up, little brother? Come down and eat," his second sister stopped him and told him to go down.

"I don't want to eat. There's not a single good dish," the little brother pouted and walked toward his room.

"No, you must come down and eat today. We let you order a dish every day, but today we forgot to buy it, so you won't eat?" his father said sternly.

The little brother had no choice but to go down. The shrimp, fish, and shredded meat in the bowl on the table did not suit his taste. Every day, he had to have chunks of spareribs to eat. He also had a strange habit: the shrimp, fish, and meat had to be plain stir-fried. If some vegetables or other things were added, he would not eat it; he would refuse to eat the whole bowl of food.

"Eat quickly. If you don't eat, we won't buy anything for you to eat in the future," his father was particularly fierce today, for some reason.

The little brother picked up his chopsticks, and tears dripped into his rice bowl. But stubborn as he was, he didn't pick at any of the dishes, but stuffed mouthfuls of white rice into his mouth. In less than two minutes, he left the table, considering himself to have finished eating.

"Why isn't Mom coming down for dinner?" his third sister suddenly noticed that Mom hadn't come down and exclaimed. She sent the nanny upstairs to invite her.

"Madam says she's feeling a little unwell today and doesn't want to eat dinner. She'll buy noodles to eat later!" the nanny reported back.

"Second sister, can I share some of my rice with you?" his tenth sister had just come back from college and barely had room for a grain of rice in her stomach, but she was afraid of being scolded by her father, so she could only force herself to pretend to eat.

"I can't eat either. I ate too many snacks today. You should share it with our eldest sister!"

"Don't you go recommending me. We had a tea party at school today, and I filled my stomach with sweets and snacks," his eldest sister quickly said, giving a lot of reasons.

"Miss, if you can't eat, leave it. We can give it to Ah Hua later," the clever Ah Jin resolved this "crisis" of excess rice.

"Eat fewer snacks in the future. Rice prices are so expensive, and you still keep saying you can't eat. Think about the beggars on the streets who are hungry and have no food to eat. Then you'll be satisfied!" It was his father's voice again.

In fact, he himself ate out almost every day, and invitations to banquets kept coming: "Jinmen," "International Hotel," "Meihua".... He himself told us that he was tired of eating these dishes and preferred to order a plate of green vegetables and tofu at home.

"Dad, it's not like we can't eat every day. You rarely eat at home, and it just so happens that we're all full of snacks today," his third sister said playfully.

His father didn't say anything. But after that, at every meal, it was still the same: everyone kept saying, "I can't eat!"

What with rice prices rising and falling, what with speculators manipulating the market, people in this family paid no attention.

On the street, three people were seen snatching rice, and they were caught by the police and beaten severely.

"Ah! Young people don't work, but they snatch rice. They deserve it!" his third sister said with a sigh.

On the street, there was a long line of people in rags, old, young, and middle-aged, all vying to do something.

"Eldest sister, what are these people doing?" the little brother asked in surprise.

"They're scrambling to buy broken rice," his eldest sister answered calmly.

"Can you eat broken rice?" the little brother was even more surprised.

"You have white rice but won't eat it and only want spareribs. These poor people can't even afford broken rice!"

Although the little brother didn't say anything, he was thinking in his heart: How can they compare to us? My father earns money every day. They're poor people, and we're rich! With a turn of his mind, the little brother suddenly thought of a sentence:

"Eldest sister, you don't need to talk about me. Don't you also say 'I can't eat' every day?"

### Silent Sorrow

— Huiran

Mr. Zong looked haggard and distressed, sitting blankly on the large sofa. It was very noisy outside the window, but he remained silent.

Mrs. Zong, wearing a new summer outfit, drifted into the bedroom. Although the sound of her leather shoes was very loud, it did not change Mr. Zong's attitude.

Mrs. Zong was surprised to see her husband's abnormal attitude. "What! Are you unhappy again? Who angered you!"

Mr. Zong cast his dim gaze over his wife, lingered for a moment, and remained silent.

Mrs. Zong was even more puzzled, but she had no way to elicit her husband's thoughts. She listlessly took off her spring dress and her leather shoes.

The room was quiet, with only the "tick-tock" of the clock dispelling the barrier between the two.

"Have you had dinner?" Mrs. Zong asked clearly.

"I haven't eaten!" Mr. Zong said softly.

"Then should I call and order a meal for you?"

"No, I don't want to eat. I can't eat!"

"Who are you quarreling with! You don't even want to eat dinner!" Mrs. Zong took advantage of the only opportunity to entice her husband to tell her the reason for his depression.

"Damn it, rice prices have fallen to such a low point!"

"Then the five hundred bags of rice you bought last week will be a loss!"

"Isn't it! Last week I bought them for one hundred and thirty-five yuan, and now they've fallen to one hundred and fifteen yuan. It's a loss of more than ten thousand!"

"Didn't I tell you to sell them when they were at one hundred and fifty yuan! You insisted that rice prices would reach two hundred yuan. Now, good, not only didn't you earn anything, but you've lost so much!"

"Who wants you to taunt me? The situation is already like this. I just won't sell them. I'll see how low they can go!"

"Strange, what is the reason they've fallen like this!"

"......"

### Dance Hall

— Yangtze River

I happened to see an illustration in an American magazine of a dance hall in a city near the front lines of a European warring country. Although many still maintain their business, they are only for the entertainment of frontline soldiers, and civilians are not allowed to enter. Therefore, a sign with the words "Uniform only" is newly hung at the entrance of some dance halls.

But in this place of singing and dancing, the dance hall has a sign that says "Armed soldiers are not welcome". The same form of enjoyment, but contains two different contents. (Uniform unwelcome).

I am very interested in these two contrasts.

### Begonia

— Qin Duou

(8) Appreciable Friendship

"Sure! Why wouldn't it be possible?"

"However, if you have to pay extra, Lao San, it can only be charged to your account!" As he rang the bell, he pretended to be very serious.

Qiu Haitang couldn't help but laugh.

"Would it be possible for us to get a box of matches?" The nurse came in, and Yu Kun stood up and said to her, "Also, may I ask you, is it possible for my friend to eat something now?"

Qiu Haitang really didn't expect that he would take this opportunity to coax him to eat.

"Why wouldn't it be? The difficulty lies in him not wanting to eat himself!" The nurse said solemnly.

"He feels better now, probably because he saw me!" Seeing his funny look, the female nurse couldn't help but smile. "So I persuaded him to eat something, and he himself is willing to eat."

"Okay, then I'll go get the chicken soup right away!" The nurse immediately went out again.

Yu Kun picked up the rumpled long gown that he had just taken off from the chair and threw it casually over his shoulder. The crumpled and bent cigarette was stuffed back into his pocket again.

"Lao San, Meibao is doing well. According to my inquiries from everyone, everyone says her mother is also doing well. Yuan the Fat Man didn't make things difficult for her, and she's doing well in Beijing right now. That way, your heart can be at peace!" He stood between the hospital bed and the door, with a seriousness on his face that had never been seen before. "I can't delay any longer. The doctor wants to buy a few foreign biscuits for Meibao to eat! We can't talk about anything else right now. I just want to persuade you to rest and recuperate. It doesn't matter if you can't eat as an actor. No one in the world starves to death! If you worry so much that you don't eat or sleep, you'll really kill yourself! Good brother, please put your mind at ease!"

### Longevity Star

— Jue Hui

The Longevity Star is neither a god, nor a Buddha, nor a ghost. The Longevity Star is a person.

But the reason why he is called the Longevity Star is because he "does good deeds"!

The Longevity Star was originally called Wang Ba (turtle).

It is not clear from what time he was called that. It is also not clear where he was called that. It seems that Wang Ba was born to be the Longevity Star. If the Longevity Star does not appear, what will happen to the people?

Although, sometimes he is happy and "admires" himself in the mirror for a while: his forehead is as long as a washboard, plus triangular eyes, an eagle nose, and a lion's mouth, but it's also a bit... But the Longevity Star is ultimately about longevity, "by the mandate of Heaven"!

Wang Ba, no! The Longevity Star is this year a ripe old age, no more, no less, just over forty years old. He is right between old and "young"; so "respect your elders as you would your own; care for the young as you would your own", he is perfect!

Once, he "stored" rice; once, he "stored" coal; and many times, he "stored" many things. There is a "reason" for this; and this "reason" is said to have been given to him by Jesus, that is, in the future, when Shanghai is truly "isolated", the five million citizens will not have to stretch out their legs and wait for death.

"I have to think for others every day I live!" he often said in a very "serious" manner, and his chest was like a copper drum, beating with a booming sound. "I would rather "tire" myself to death than let people "in the future" starve to death!"

But people are confused.

Now, the news of the sale of Hong Kong rice has reached his ears, and the Longevity Star has changed: "You don't understand me, they don't understand me, you can't let good people lose money!" This time he is not patting his chest; he is stamping his feet.

But people are confused.

So, he cries on this side and jumps on that side; if you are full and have nothing to do and go to persuade him, he will take you as the "representative" of the five million citizens; scold you a lot, "teach" you a lesson, shake his head, sigh, and leave.

The Longevity Star is so "wronged", I am afraid there are no ancient people before him, and there will be no future generations after him!

No wonder the Longevity Star wants to be like "true"; several new lines have been added to his forehead, his beard is as messy as overgrown thatch, and he is as dull as wood...

### Tangled Matchmaking: Hollywood's Fortune Tellers

— Xin Juan

In Hollywood, it can be said that there are all kinds of people, and many interesting news of all kinds have been generated. There are also fortune-tellers there who make a living by reciting a few incantations, because many female stars believe in superstition, so those fortune-tellers' business is also booming.

Recently, an astrologer named Ansel has published some information about the marriage of female stars, just like "Justice Qiao matching couples at random." It's fun because it's so messy. He thinks that Betty Grable, the leading actress in "Red Flower and Fragrant Song" and "Immortal Music Street" (recently elected as the "best figure" female star in Hollywood), is a moon star, and she is always hesitant in doing things. She should marry someone like Taylor Power. But I don't know what he will do with Annabella? (Betty Grable's ex-husband is Jack Coghen, a red child star from ten years ago who has now retired.)

He believes that Katharine Hepburn, the leading actress in "Old Love, New Favor," who recently returned to the film industry from Broadway, should marry someone like the musician Stokowski. Katharine Hepburn is considered a "mysterious female star" in Hollywood, and her marriage has never been settled. But Stokowski is already very old, and Katharine Hepburn is only old enough to be his daughter. Do you think this prediction is absurd?

He also said many strange things, such as Jean Arthur should marry Dana Andrews, Susan Hayward should marry Edward G. Robinson, Bette Davis should marry Laurence Olivier, Lucille Ball should marry Jascha Heifetz, the violin expert of "Melody of Spring," and Diana Durbin should marry Henry Fonda. But in fact, some of them have only been married for a short time, such as Diana Durbin and Vaughn Paul, and Bette Davis and Arthur Farnsworth, while some already have children.

### Scenes from the Entertainment World

— Wen

Minhua's fourth work has been named "Tears of Longing." It is said that the script was submitted from the outside and the plot is quite novel. However, because the company's photography studio has been temporarily taken back by Meicheng to produce "Hong Guanjiao," the play has been decided to postpone production until mid-September.

Li Ming, a newcomer from Guolian, has not developed in the company, so it has been rumored recently that he will join the Lubaobao Theater. It is said that Gu Menghu is currently in negotiations, and it is likely to become a reality.

Yue Feng's new work after "Blue Sea, Blue Sky" has been named "Soul Returns to Autumn River." The film was originally scheduled to star Chen Yanyan, but because Chen played an important role in the play "Home," she could not handle both, so it was decided to have Yuan Meiyun play the lead role.

The ancient costume film "Wang Zhaojun" was originally intended to be discontinued, but because the Guolian authorities did not want to waste the film, it has been decided to continue production. However, the position of director has been changed to Yang Xiaozhong.

Recently, the Shanghai Theater Company's "City of Sorrow" is said to be adapted into a film by a certain company. However, because the play is a severe satire of rice merchants, the content of the play will be slightly changed.

### A Summary of the Philosophy of Practical Action

— Zong Yu

The first object of life is to advocate labor. Everyone should practice the idea that hands are all-powerful and labor is sacred, with each person being a productive component. The second is to strive to serve others. I serve others, and do not allow others to serve me. Everyone should consider it their duty to help others stand and to help others succeed.

### Blood Rain and Exquisite Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 9: Why Does He Pity You, Arriving at the Ends of the Earth?

Because Liu Yinyang was being coy and wouldn't take off his long gown, and Liu Yinying's aunt was also there, he felt it inconvenient to take it off himself. He simply tucked the corners of his gown into his belt, front and back, drew the Crimson Phoenix sword from its scabbard, walked to the center of the courtyard, and said to Liu Yinyang, "How presumptuous." Slowly, he began to dance, moving forward and backward, left and right, up and down, all in time with the rhythm. Xu Jing this evening was doing his best to show off his skills. He only regretted that his swordsmanship was ordinary, with nothing striking about it, and he couldn't compete with others. Therefore, after dancing a routine of Plum Blossom Swordplay, he immediately stopped and said to Liu Yinyang with a smile, "A poor donkey's skill, this is all there is to it. Please don't laugh at me, Brother Liu." Liu Yinying, after watching Xu Jing's sword dance, smiled and said, "This is already not easy, but if you want to reach the highest level, you still need to practice diligently." Xu Jing said, "I have no famous teacher to instruct me, so I am stuck in place, making no progress. Now that I have met Brother Liu, I hope you will not hesitate to give me some guidance. After I finish my dance, I would like to see Brother Liu's profound swordsmanship, so that I may get a glimpse of the secrets." Liu Yinying then swung his sword and said, "Then I will also make a fool of myself once." So, he raised the White Energy Sword upwards, performing the White Crane Soaring to the Sky posture, swooshing and rattling as he danced faster and faster, like a hawk swooping down on a rabbit, like a phoenix soaring and flying, with dazzling swordplay in a myriad of forms. Xu Jing clapped his hands and exclaimed, "Excellent!" Liu Yinyang's aunt laughed and said, "Tonight, Ying'er is so elegant, dancing for a while is enough. Quickly stop and accompany Master Xu to eat." Liu Yinying abruptly stopped the sword dance, stood smiling in front of Xu Jing, and said, "My meager skills are barely worthy of your sight. I hope they do not offend our esteemed guest?" Xu Jing said, "Brother Liu's swordsmanship is so brilliant, yet he is so humble, which makes me even more ashamed." The two then returned to the guest room, put down their swords, returned to their original seats, and poured each other a full cup. The little maid had already brought up a plate of cooked chicken. Liu Yinying accompanied Xu Jing in drinking another cup. Xu Jing said, "Brother Liu's swordsmanship is unparalleled in the world, and I am completely overwhelmed. May I ask Brother Liu to tell me about his life experience? There must be something surprising and delightful about it." Liu Yinying shook his head and said, "The past is something that makes people sad when brought up, and it is not something to be told to outsiders. Let's wait until later to tell you. In short, I am an isolated person, drifting around the world. Only my aunt here is my closest relative. Master Xu, let's drink a few more cups." Seeing that Liu Yinying repeatedly refused to speak directly, he guessed that he had some unspeakable secrets, and did not dare to press him. He raised his cup and drank another cup, and then poured more wine. He saw Liu Yinying supporting his chin with one hand, looking at the lamplight, as if recalling the past. He picked up the wine cup and said, "Please." (70)

### Mrs. Minhua, Jin Xinmin's New Venture

— Wu Ming

Since Jin Xinmin founded the Minhua Company and successfully produced the film "Confucius," which received critical acclaim, he has, in effect, established his superior position in the film world. Recently, Jin Xinmin has also partnered with Zheng Weixian of the MGM Dance Hall and others to establish the Yu Gu Restaurant, located in the western part of the New World. After more than four months of renovation, it officially opened yesterday, with Xu Qianlin, Wen Lanting, and He Wuliang, prominent figures, officiating the opening.

The opening time was 10 a.m. The reporter squeezed into the Jin Gu in the crowd. The entrance was filled with flower baskets sent by various circles, exuding a burst of fragrance, attracting the attention of passers-by. Stepping on the stairs, a bright, colorful parrot was nodding to everyone who went upstairs to greet them. It is said that this parrot was sent by Fei Mu and his three brothers and is worth over a hundred yuan.

Upstairs, there are a total of five rooms, including two large rooms, a large hall, and the Flying Scissors, each with a deck. In each room, He Ming broadcasts the latest Chinese and Western music, leaving the guests with a beautiful impression. The "Confucius" song was specially broadcasted by He Ming yesterday, which is a solemn and sacred song that has never been heard on the market. It is said that the new design of Jin Gu was designed by Fei Kang, the younger brother of Fei Mu, and constructed by the Yaping Decoration Company. The air conditioning was installed by the Hezong Company. All the equipment is unique and novel, making it a leader in Shanghai.
