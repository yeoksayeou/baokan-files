### China Awaits Full US Aid; Able to Contend with Japan Independently; Far East War Affects the Global Situation; Chiang Kai-shek's Statement to American Reporters

Chongqing - Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated today that if the United States immediately provides aid to China, the Chinese army can begin a counter-offensive, thereby relieving international tensions in the Pacific and perhaps expediting peace in Europe. The Chairman, in a meeting with an Associated Press reporter, discussed President Roosevelt's promises regarding China. He stated that if China receives sufficient material aid, it will be able to contend with Japan independently. The Chairman made a similar statement during his last meeting with an Associated Press reporter. On January 29th of this year, the Chairman, when meeting with Associated Press Far East Manager Mr. Mullis, said that if the United States were to provide China with half the aid it gives to Britain, the United States would not risk being drawn into the vortex of the Far East war. The Chairman said, "President Roosevelt has guaranteed that China will receive US aid while resisting the aggressor. I would like to express my gratitude for this guarantee. President Roosevelt's emphasis on prompt action will have a significant impact on the situation in the Far East. China has a large and well-trained army that can use American military supplies for a counter-offensive. This counter-offensive will have the effect of relieving international tensions in the Pacific. China's counter-offensive may even shorten the duration of the European war and hasten the restoration of world peace. After the conclusion of this war in Asia and Europe, if the great American democracy can participate in a large part of world construction as promised by President Roosevelt, it will surely produce a better world order." The Chairman reiterated what he had said to Mr. Mullis previously, stating that if China has sufficient material aid, it will be able to contend with Japan without the need for external military assistance. He said that China urgently needs more American financial and military aid to continue its war against Japan. (Associated Press dispatch from the 18th)

### US Warships Visit New Zealand; Indication of Anglo-American Cooperation in the Far East; Roosevelt Approves Defense Plan for Guam; Philippine Army Reservists Enlist for Training

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday signed the Fourth National Defense Budget Appropriation Bill for $1,533,000,000, of which $681,000,000 is for the Navy, including continued construction costs for American bases leased from Britain in the Atlantic and for Pacific defenses (including Samoa and Guam); and $695,000,000 is for the Army, mostly for the construction of barracks. (Associated Press dispatch from the 18th)

Washington - President Roosevelt approved the construction of naval bases on Guam and Samoa when he signed the appropriation of $153,300,000 last night. It is now set to allocate $13 million for naval construction on the islands. (Haitong dispatch from the 18th)

Washington - British diplomatic circles yesterday believed that the visit of six American warships to Auckland, New Zealand, was a display of Anglo-American cooperation in the Far East. The Navy Department announced that it had recently dispatched two of the newest 10,000-ton cruisers and four destroyers from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii for the visit. It is widely believed that this action is another page in the Pacific "war of nerves," as Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yōsuke has just embarked for Berlin, and this action occurred shortly after President Roosevelt's declaration of his intention to vigorously aid China.

Manila - 230,000 Philippine Army reservists will be drafted into the army tomorrow for ten days of special training. (Haitong dispatch from the 18th)

### US Secretary of the Navy Urges; National Unity

Baltimore, Ohio - Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox recently stated in a speech here that internal strife in the United States must cease so that all sectors can work together to complete the national defense plan. "The United States is at a critical juncture of life and death. All of us free people are prepared to respond to any call, even to tread through boiling water and walk on fire. However, ending domestic disputes is truly the most urgent task." (Havas dispatch from the 18th)

### Matsuoka Yōsuke; Passes Through Soviet Territory to Berlin; No Possibility of Improving US-Japan Relations Unless Japan Withdraws from Axis Alliance

Changchun - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka entered Soviet territory at approximately 3:00 PM yesterday. Representatives of the Soviet government welcomed him at the border military station and escorted Matsuoka onto a special train en route to Moscow and then Berlin. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 18th)

### Vietnam Sends Experts to Japan; To Confer on Details of Agreements

Hanoi - Officials announced that the Vietnamese authorities are dispatching experts Balaud and Michtaël, as well as engineers Ruppel and Ries, a group of four, to Tokyo on Wednesday to confer with the Japanese government on the details of the Thai-Vietnamese agreement. (Associated Press dispatch from the 18th)

Bangkok - The Thai government has established a new department to manage the land ceded by Vietnam. The department changed two place names, using the names of Lieutenant Colonel Harbley, Commander-in-Chief of the Thai Northern Army, and Sunghram, Prime Minister of the Thai Cabinet, as place names. It is likely that the Thai-Vietnamese peace agreement will be formally approved by the end of March or early April. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 18th)

Berlin - An American newspaper published an opinion stating that if Japan could withdraw from the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, the American government would consider restoring normal relations with Japan. Political figures here are paying close attention to this, and they believe that this American attempt is intended to isolate Japan so that it can be more easily forced to accept American intentions. Regarding this matter, the Nazi Party's official newspaper, the "Völkischer Beobachter," stated that Japan cannot abandon its mission of building a new order in East Asia, and therefore Japan will certainly adhere to the terms of the Tripartite Pact. (Havas dispatch from the 17th)

New York - According to Japanese sources here, Tokyo is making remarkable plans politically, the result of which may be an immediate reorganization of the Japanese cabinet. Foreign Minister Matsuoka will resign immediately after returning home from his visit to Berlin, and Japan will immediately withdraw from the Axis. Japanese radical patriots are now strongly urging Prime Minister Konoe to continue advancing southward, believing that Germany will maintain its military operations against Britain. Konoe is not certain about his political soundness and is quite weary of his duties. He is now awaiting Matsuoka's report. Matsuoka is now seeking to obtain a guarantee from Germany that Britain will be defeated, and to conclude a non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union as soon as possible. The first point to be decided is the question of Japan's loyalty to the Axis. If Matsuoka finds Germany's attitude "insincere" after his talks with the German and Italian leaders, he will certainly express that Japan "has no choice but to withdraw from the Axis because its allies cannot fulfill the terms of the alliance." After that, if Matsuoka still serves as foreign minister, Japan may strongly request the United States to mediate the Sino-Japanese war. (International dispatch from the 18th)

### Repercussions of Active US Aid to Britain; Germany Prepares to Sever Relations with the US; Rumor of German Long-Range Submarines Entering US Waters; Aim is to Disrupt Atlantic Shipping

New York - The well-known commentator Mr. Seymour stated that, according to diplomatic observers in Washington, Mr. Butler will soon sever diplomatic relations with the United States. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)

Washington - It is reported that the United States has been notified that Germany intends to begin submarine activity in the waters near New York. According to foreign sources, Germany will use long-range submarines capable of navigating dozens of miles to disrupt shipping off the US Atlantic coast. Although this information has been conveyed to the United States, no details are available regarding the nature or location of these activities. It is reported that the main purpose is to cause confusion in shipping in the area. (Associated Press dispatch from the 18th)

Washington - Authoritative sources here have learned that a German long-range submarine has been dispatched to US territorial waters. The US State Department and British officials are remaining silent on this matter. According to information obtained here, this Nazi underwater pirate ship has left its European base, but it is not yet known whether it has reached the Atlantic coast. It is rumored that the mission of this German submarine is only to have a propaganda impact and will not take actual action to disrupt convoys. Experts point out that a lone submarine has little military value. We should remember that during the last World War, German submarines traveled to the US coast and sank a number of ships. (International dispatch from the 18th)

American Interference in the European War; Germany and Italy Vehemently Condemn

Berlin - The German Foreign Ministry stated to foreign reporters yesterday that German newspapers will respond to President Roosevelt's speech. If President Roosevelt delivers a speech to the Nazi Party and wants to receive a response, he will receive an appropriate and clear response. However, the German Foreign Ministry will refuse to respond to the American President's stale propaganda rhetoric. Currently, the German Foreign Ministry "must proceed with more important matters" and cannot respond to clichés such as Germany's plan to dominate the world. (Haitong dispatch from the 18th)

Berlin - Berlin newspapers vehemently attacked President Roosevelt's speech on Saturday night criticizing Germany, denouncing Roosevelt as "poisoning the well," "promoting war," and a "wolf in sheep's clothing." The Beobachter's double-size headline read, "Blood-stained crimes of Jewish Anglo-Saxon Capitalism." (Associated Press dispatch from the 18th)

Berlin - German newspapers last night harshly criticized President Roosevelt's speech. The newspapers used headlines such as "The Monroe Doctrine Sacrificed on the Altar of World Democracy," "Wall Street Wants to Be the Master of the Future World Order," and "The Lie of Democratic Freedom." They opposed Roosevelt's attempt to force all countries in the world to accept the American concept of "freedom." The "German Political News Service," the mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, stated that Roosevelt's speech indicated that he would abandon the traditional policies of American diplomacy but lacked the courage to state his goals. He views the United States as the arsenal of democracy and his plan is a world order suitable to his taste, forcing allies and enemies alike to accept it. The newspaper declared that although the United States is a strong country in the Western Hemisphere, it cannot demand world leadership. Any interference by the United States will be rejected by Europe and viewed as hateful and dangerous arrogance. If the United States must interfere, Europe will reject it by the most violent means. (Haitong dispatch from the 18th)

Rome - The famous Italian journalist Gaeta commented on President Roosevelt's speech yesterday, stating that President Roosevelt did not explain the true purpose of his interference in the European war. If Roosevelt wants to be the arbiter of Europe's fate, he must first read more history, study the current situation in Europe, and the reasons why 180 million Europeans are fighting against Britain and uniting in the Tripartite Pact. If the United States wants to say more about the new world order, it should do less. American cooperation with Britain to attack the signatories of the Tripartite Pact will not turn enemies into friends. The relationship between the United States and Europe after peace is established will depend on the attitude the United States adopts during the war. Roosevelt's speech was an attempt to probe for American participation in the war and to legalize his aggressive behavior. Roosevelt seems to have forgotten the will of George Washington, the founding hero of the United States, and has overturned the Monroe Doctrine. (Haitong dispatch from the 18th)

### French Naval Strength; Still Extremely Formidable

Lausanne - There has been much international attention on the remaining strength of the French Navy since a portion of it was taken care of by Britain. The Lausanne Daily recently published a special dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Vichy stating that the current French fleet is stronger than it was in June of last year, when France and Germany signed the armistice agreement, and is sufficient to support French policy. In terms of battleships, the 35,000-ton "Jean Bart" and "Richelieu" are currently stationed in Casablanca, Morocco, and Dakar, West Africa, respectively, and their strength is steadily increasing. The "Dunkerque," although damaged, will soon be repaired and will have excellent combat capabilities. The "Strasbourg" is still being used as a training ship. As for the "Provence," which was once rumored to have sunk, it is actually intact in Toulon. In short, the French battleship losses are only three ships: the "Bretagne," which sank in Oran, Algeria, the "Dunkerque," which is currently under repair, and the "Lorraine," which was detained in Alexandria, Egypt. (Havas dispatch from the 17th)

### Weygand Inspects; Combat Troops

Vichy - General Weygand, the French government's representative in Africa, inspected 15,000 French combat troops in Oran yesterday. They swore allegiance to the motherland. Those participating in the inspection ceremony included 6,000 schoolchildren. (Haitong dispatch from the 18th)

Editorial

### "Italy's Great War Against Enemy Nations"

Italy's strength is insufficient to contend with Britain and Greece, and it has fallen into dire straits. At this time, if Germany were to launch a lightning attack on the British Isles, Italy's difficulties might be temporarily relieved; if Japan were to seize the opportunity to invade Britain's eastern territories, Italy's difficulties might be considerably lessened; but Germany and Japan each have their own concerns and their own plans, and are unable to see "righteousness" and act accordingly. According to recent trends, German troops are pouring into Bulgaria, and the United States is emphasizing aid to both Britain and Greece. This is the prelude to the next great war; even if the great war battlefield is not entirely within the land, sea, and air controlled by Mussolini's Italy, Italy's land, sea, and air will inevitably be enveloped by the thickest gunpowder atmosphere of the great war.

Strategy does not allow for mechanical application, but rather takes improvisation as a general rule, as is evident in the European war. In the European war, the basic strategy of Germany and Italy was a lightning attack, a quick victory. But now they have had to abandon this strategy. The basic strategy of the British side is to organize and mobilize the manpower and material resources of its various territories, to intensify the naval blockade against Germany and Italy, and to patiently await the maturation of the opportunity to seize final victory, but now there is hope for an early start. Is this a miscalculation in the planning, a mid-course correction? The main key lies in the rapid completion of the defense of the British Isles, rendering the opponent's lightning strike ineffective from the start; and in the bravery of Greece's resistance, which has repeatedly achieved unexpected feats; Italy has not only been defeated by Greece, but has also fully exposed unexpected weaknesses in the African war; thus, the great possibility of first defeating Italy has been discovered. In the late summer and autumn of last year, Germany and Italy, with their ambition to seize the British Isles in one fell swoop, sang loudly about the "Great War of the British Empire"; but now the reality has answered that it is not the Great War of the British Empire, but unexpectedly the "Great War of the Italian Empire" has been formed. The Great War of the Italian Empire was sparked by its own active invasion of Greece. For the past five months, in the course of all land, sea, and air combat on the two continents of Europe and Africa, and on the two seas of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, Italy has repeatedly failed. The first reason for its disastrous defeat is the overestimation of its own strength and the misestimation of the determination and strength of Britain and Greece. When it began its invasion of Greece, it only used 20,000 men, and thought it could complete the conquest of Greece; when it encountered British and Greek resistance and counterattacks, it was not only impossible for Italy to reinforce its advance, but even impossible to hold its ground or retreat in full force; the number of soldiers decreased with each battle, and the only fate was continuous retreat. The second reason is Mussolini's own strategic error. In the African war, in order to satisfy his ambition for an African empire, he made zealous preparations to use Libya as a base to attack Egypt, reach the Suez Canal, and cut off the British Empire's lifeline. He concentrated the supplies, transportation, ordnance, and tools in this area at the port of Bardia, which was close to the front line. When the British garrison greatly reinforced and launched a fierce attack, General Graziani, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in Africa, advocated a rapid withdrawal from Bardia to preserve strength and fight elsewhere, but Mussolini ordered him to defend Bardia. Therefore, after nineteen days of bloody fighting, when Bardia fell, the Italian army in eastern Libya was in fact largely disintegrated and destroyed, and of course it could no longer offer effective resistance in the subsequent battles for key locations such as Tobruk and Benghazi. The situation on the Greek side was also very similar. When the British and Greek forces launched a large-scale counterattack, General Badoglio, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces, considered retreating to the port of Vlorë in Albania as soon as possible in order to coordinate with the rear and counterattack with reinforcements from the sea, but Mussolini ordered him to advance. As a result, the attempt to seize military ports such as Salonika was of course not achieved, and the Italian army fought until it was largely destroyed, and the remnant forces had no choice but to collapse. The third reason lies in the fundamental difficulty of reinforcement and supply. The full strength of the Italian navy pales in comparison to the British Mediterranean Fleet. Therefore, the Italian side has made it its basic strategy to avoid naval battles with Britain as much as possible, and it has become increasingly timid due to the occasional naval battles resulting in disastrous defeats. With the Mediterranean Sea controlled by British warships, and Albanian ports subject to intense British air strikes, Italy has fallen into a state of insufficient rear support in both the European and African theaters. The most obvious example is that the Italian mechanized units in Africa lost their effectiveness due to the gasoline shortage.

All of this has increased Britain's courage and has further advanced the goal of defeating Italy. All kinds of British expressions and measures in recent times have pointed to this, even military ports on Italian territory, such as Genoa, have been subjected to attempted bombardments by British warships. The large-scale intrusion of German troops into Bulgaria recently is precisely to relieve Italy's current crisis; and the large-scale landing of British troops in Greece is also in preparation for a major war.

To date, Italy has lost two of its three important ports in the Libyan region of Africa, leaving only the port of Tripoli, which is only 250 miles from the British base of Malta and under direct threat; therefore, if the Italian army does not want to abandon the entire Libya, it must firmly defend the port of Tripoli, otherwise it will be trapped and have no way out. In Italian East Africa, the British army is now coordinating with the Abyssinian indigenous army and advancing directly toward the Abyssinian capital. Here, Italy has the Red Sea on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other, both under British control, and overseas aid is fundamentally impossible. Its fate will depend on the degree to which it can support itself in this region. The sudden transport and coordination of the British fleet with the army to overcome Berbera, the capital of Somaliland, the day before yesterday was another major blow to the Italian army. In Europe, because of the complexities of international relations, the German army cannot go directly from Bulgaria to Torres and Salonika, which is a great loss on the Axis side, but the German army is still able to maintain its advantage, so Italy is not in any major danger in this area. But can half of the strength support the overall situation? The question remains a great one. What's more, the Mediterranean Sea, which surrounds Italy, does not become Italy's impregnable defense, but rather becomes the stepping stone for Britain, which possesses naval supremacy. When the major war begins and Britain and Greece launch their active offensive, the Italian fleet will have no choice but to be forced to fight. Its only remaining hope of victory, apart from its own strength achieving miraculous results, is to rely on the assistance of the German air force and to expect the French fleet to help Italy against Britain.

How exactly this Great War of the Italian Empire will unfold will probably soon be answered by facts.

Correction: In yesterday's editorial, section four, line twelve, after the sentence "Aid to China...", the phrase "The longer Japan is bogged down, the more it spends, the less it remains, and the more tragic its defeat will be" was omitted. This is hereby supplemented.

### British Commercial Interests on the Yangtze River: Entirely Deprived by the Japanese; Vessels Detained and Not Returned; Trade Entering and Exiting Lacking Vitality

Hankou: At the annual meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce, Chairman Tate reported on the state of commerce on the Yangtze River, stating that the central Chinese businesses in Yichang and their interests were subject to all kinds of extremely unpleasant restrictions, amounting to exclusion. The Japanese military authorities continued to interfere with British commercial interests, forcibly detaining their vessels and seizing the cargo on board. Although the British authorities made strong representations, they were ineffective. Although the detained British ships were eventually returned to their owners, the cargo they carried had been taken away. What justification is there for this kind of behavior that violates the rights of neutral countries? It is truly puzzling. Regarding the trade of British people in Hankou, since the early part of last year, no British or foreign individuals have participated in export trade. All trade consisted of selling the remaining tung oil, bristles, tea, and cotton stored locally to merchants under the strict control of the Japanese authorities. There is nothing else to speak of. The sources of rural products have been cut off, and supplies are extremely scarce, resulting in a complete lack of vitality in the Hankou export market. As for the import trade of British merchants, it is also insignificant. Although third-country merchants may see their goods sold in the market, this is only because Japanese merchants transport them in with permits from the Japanese authorities. The reason these goods appear in the market is because their good quality is widely known or because there is nothing to replace them. As for the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, there is also no progress at all. British industries are still not allowed to be used by British people. Although there was hope for the opening of the Yangtze River to foreign commerce and navigation as far as Nanjing, this has now become a mirage. As a result, on the 1,400-mile navigable waterway of the Yangtze River from Shanghai to Chongqing, British ships can only operate within the final 170 miles. Apart from the Japanese, British and foreign vessels are idle in Hankou all year round, and the legal use of docks and wharves has not been restored. Although there have been repeated negotiations, the Japanese side always uses military necessity as an excuse to not relax its restrictions in the slightest. (Reuters, March 18th)

### Japanese-Dutch East Indies Economic Negotiations: To Enter a New Phase

Tokyo: According to Japanese sources in Batavia, Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens may arrive here from the UK via the US on April 1st, accompanied by the Dutch Minister of Colonies, Welter. Yesterday, the Director of the Information Bureau of the Dutch East Indies government, Leimant, stated that the upcoming arrival of the Dutch Foreign Minister and the Minister of Colonies has no political significance. Its purpose is merely to strengthen the connection between the Dutch government in London and the authorities in the Dutch East Indies.

It is reported that Kleffens and Welter will not go to Singapore or Sydney. At the same time, the talks between the Director of the Commercial Bureau of the Dutch East Indies, Hogerstraeten, and the Japanese Consul General, Ishizawa, are reported to be nearing completion.

### Roosevelt's Declaration of Aid to China: China Greatly Encouraged; Malicious Rumors Swept Away; Tokyo Acts Calm

Chongqing: According to reliable sources, Chinese political circles and those close to Chairman Chiang are unanimously pleased with President Roosevelt's speech. They consider his strong statement that the United States will provide material assistance to Britain and other countries opposing the Axis powers until they achieve total victory to be a great guarantee. Furthermore, President Roosevelt's statement that the United States will continue to make a major contribution during the period of world reconstruction is even more encouraging to the Chinese people. China has decided to continue to defend its sovereignty and what other democratic countries are defending. In recent weeks, Japan has repeatedly spread malicious rumors, claiming that cracks have appeared in China's unity and that its ability to resist has been weakened by political disagreements, in an attempt to reduce US confidence in China. These rumors have been completely shattered by the US President's declaration that the hundreds of millions of Chinese people have a great aspiration to defend their country. Chinese political figures are deeply satisfied that the United States has such a clear understanding of Chinese public opinion and the contribution China has made in the united front of democratic countries against the Axis powers' aggression.

Tokyo: Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told foreign reporters this morning that there are no novel elements in President Roosevelt's speech at the White House on Saturday. When asked how Japan felt about the statement that General Chiang Kai-shek should receive US aid, Ishii replied that Japan's attitude had already been decided. He then mentioned the issue of US warships sailing to New Zealand, saying that this was part of the US Navy's exercise and had nothing to do with Japan. (Reuters, March 18th)

Tokyo: Although Tokyo's Japanese newspapers unanimously condemned President Roosevelt's Saturday speech last night, their attitude was quite calm. The Asahi Shimbun subtly implied that Japan will be forced to adopt Germany's method of dealing with US aid to counter US aid to China. All newspapers unanimously declared that President Roosevelt is leading the United States into war. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that President Roosevelt is helping England, France, and the Netherlands to continue their work of developing the Asian people. The president is also helping General Chiang Kai-shek to fight Japan, attempting to prolong the Sino-Japanese War to weaken Japan. The Kokumin Shimbun stated that President Roosevelt's tone made people feel that the United States was thinking of entering the war. However, the Chumin Shimbun believed that since US aid to Britain and Greece was so huge, it would not be able to provide much to China, which was quite fortunate. (Associated Press, March 18th)

### Tense Situation in the Balkans: British Escort Fleet Arrives in Greece; British Military Action Possible in Greece; German Forces in Bulgaria Also Increasing

London: Today, the newspapers here are indirectly stating that the British naval fleet has arrived in Greece. Before this news was reported in the newspapers, foreign sources had been widely reporting since the middle of last week that a large number of British troops and supplies had landed in Greece. These foreign sources also relayed rumors from well-informed sources that British troops would soon be fighting alongside the Greeks. Today's newspapers are reporting that a large British escort fleet has passed through an important strait and is heading from Alexandria to Piraeus in Greece. Both the Daily Mail and the Daily Chronicle have headlined this news, stating, "The silent navy has undertaken the most gigantic task, and the escort fleet has passed the Dodecanese." Prominent British military experts have hinted that British and Greek forces may fight together in Greece. Generals Wavell, Bridgeman, and Milner have all published special articles on this issue. Wavell stated that if Hitler's troops can be transferred from Germany to the Greek border, our troops can also use the same relative route. Milner said that if Hitler fights in Greece, it will allow the Allied forces to return to our old position (referring to Thessaloniki). (Associated Press, March 18th)

Istanbul: According to neutral diplomatic circles here today, Germany has increased its forces in Bulgaria to 800,000, apparently because a large number of British troops have landed in Greece. It is reported that Greece is also adopting a stronger attitude towards the German concentration in Bulgaria. It is widely believed that the German concentration was originally intended to intimidate Greece into making peace with Italy, but the determination of Britain and Greece to resist has made it impossible for Hitler to sell his empty threats. The tension in the Balkans has reached a peak, as it is generally believed that a Nazi offensive from Bulgaria is only a matter of days. Neutral sources say that Yugoslavia has firmly refused the German request to pass through the Vardar or Monastir valleys. British officials in Istanbul reiterated assurances today that British troops are prepared for a German offensive. It is estimated that 200,000 British soldiers have already landed in Greece, and another 100,000 are on the way. It is also reported that Hitler recently sent a note to Turkey, which Turkey has responded to. A special envoy has taken the reply to Berlin. Well-informed sources say that Hitler initially intended that the 15 German divisions stationed on the Bulgarian border would threaten Greece into making peace with Italy, so that he could victoriously enter the city of Athens before April 15th. However, Italian Premier Mussolini's failed counteroffensive in Albania has made his plans a pipe dream. (International News Service, March 18th)

Vichy: The Greek Embassy here has for the first time acknowledged the landing of British troops in Greece. Since the news of British troops entering Greece spread last week, this is the first official acknowledgment of the announcement. Both London and Athens have refused to comment on the news of British troops and their supplies landing in Greece. (Associated Press, March 18th)

London: According to the Daily Telegraph's Istanbul correspondent, the reason why Yugoslavia has been slow to make a deal with Germany is that the Soviet Union sent a note to the Yugoslav government last week. The contents of the note were: (1) Do not join the Tripartite Pact of the Axis powers, as this would amount to war in the Balkans. (2) If Yugoslavia is attacked, the Soviet Union is willing to provide military, technical, and financial assistance, including aircraft. (3) Regardless of what action Yugoslavia takes, it must notify the Soviet Union of its decision 48 hours in advance. It is reported that the Soviet Union has informed Turkey of these three points, and has also informed Greece. (Reuters, March 18th)

### After British Troops Capture Babile: Italian Troops Surrounded; British Actively Attacking with Land, Sea, and Air Forces; Italian Lines of Communication in Rear Danger of Being Cut Off

Cairo: A British spokesman here stated last night that, with British troops having captured Babile, another route of threat to Addis Ababa is now developing. British troops are now advancing rapidly on Addis Ababa along 13 routes, which is the heart of Italian East Africa. The spokesman also stated that the capture of Babile will further ease the supply problem. When Italian troops captured Babile last August, the Rome radio station said, "The collapse of the British Empire is now inevitable, the Red Sea has been blocked, and the British Navy cannot pass." When the British army and navy conquered Babile, the British air force not only sent bombers and fighters but also actively cooperated with armored forces. The Middle East Command issued a bulletin describing the British air force's battle achievements, saying, "On the eve of and on the day of the capture of Babile, the British air force continuously bombed enemy airfields. The bombing of the Diredawa airfield was particularly intense. British air force armored vehicles also participated in the capture of Babile. The British air force suffered no casualties." Also, whether the success of the British troops' operations in Keren is the vanguard of a major offensive or part of a six-month battle is still unclear. However, a Reuters reporter learned that "fierce battles are breaking out again in Keren." (Reuters, March 18th)

London: A Reuters correspondent at the Keren front reported that when British and Imperial troops captured the heights controlling the Keren fortress on Sunday, they captured 800 Italian soldiers. British troops began their attack on Sunday morning after six weeks of preparation, advancing along two routes from the west and southwest. In less than two hours, they had occupied two important heights overlooking the entire city. Indian troops bravely captured a solid fort on a mountain peak four and a half miles southwest of Keren and captured 400 soldiers. When a fort on a mountaintop west of the city was occupied, 200 soldiers were also captured. The Italian army launched fierce counterattacks, but were severely damaged and retreated. British artillery fire and air raids inflicted great casualties on the Italian army. (Reuters, March 18th)

London: With the British army having conquered Babile, the only port of British Somaliland has been freed from Italian control. According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, London believes that the joint conquest of the port by the British army and navy has special significance, as it poses a new threat to the Italian bases of Harar and Diredawa. Now, the only sea route for Italian troops in Abyssinia is through Asmara and Massawa, except for the Djibouti route managed by the French. It is impossible for fresh Italian forces to arrive in Abyssinia to reinforce. Recent news from Keren states that British troops are now intensifying the pressure. If they win in Keren, they will open the key to occupying the entire Eritrea. Once the Italian army's last line of defense collapses, British troops in northeast Africa can be transferred to other theaters of war. (Reuters, March 18th)

### Turkish President Sends Special Envoy to Berlin

London: According to a German news agency report, a special envoy sent by Turkish President Ismet Inonu has flown to Berlin on a German plane. It is widely believed that the special envoy is carrying the Turkish President's reply to a letter recently sent to Turkey by Hitler on a special plane. The report also stated that the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, has denied reports of his arrival in Berlin. (Reuters, March 18th)

### Italian Offensive in Albania: Weakening

London: The Athens radio station stated last night that after the Italian army's major offensive on the Albanian border last week was defeated, it now appears to be exhausted. Yesterday, artillery fire was only heard in the central sector. The Italian army launched two small-scale counterattacks, which were quickly repulsed. It launched another attack on Sunday morning, which was repulsed by the Greek army in one fell swoop. Allied air forces, believed to be British air forces, carried out successful attacks on Sunday. After describing the British air force's achievements in attacking Tirana and Vlora on Sunday, the radio station stated that it has been confirmed that 39 Italian aircraft were shot down or destroyed in air combat with Allied aircraft last week, and another 17 enemy aircraft on the ground were severely damaged. At least 15 were bombed and destroyed. The British lost only three aircraft, and both pilots were safe and sound. (Reuters, March 18th)

### Full Text of the U.S. President's Speech (Continued to Completion)

Even now, we must continuously add fuel to keep this great flame burning brightly forever, without any distinction of party, ethnicity, nationality, or religion. The efforts we are currently undertaking will have an impact on each and every one of us. Several weeks ago, I spoke of

four freedoms, namely, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. All of these have now become the last desperate stake. These freedoms may not be immediately attainable throughout the world, but humanity is indeed advancing towards this ideal through democratic steps. If we fail, if democracy is replaced by slavery, then these four freedoms will become contraband. At that time, even mentioning them will be impossible, and it would take centuries to restore them. If we achieve victory now, the meaning of freedom can be enhanced, and the stature and dignity of human life can be increased. There is a great difference between loyalty and obedience. Under a dictatorial system, obedience can be achieved through intimidation, coercion, or deception. Loyalty, however, is different. Loyalty comes from the heart, from understanding the facts and having ancient ideals. It does not require force, but rather supports one's own government. This situation, this situation, is true in present-day Britain, Greece, China, and the United States. And in many other countries, millions of men and women are praying that someday they will have the opportunity to be loyal again. Loyalty cannot be bought. Money alone cannot win this war. On this point, we must not deceive ourselves. Today, there are 1.5 million American citizens toiling in our armies. The spirit and determination of these men in our army and navy do not fall short of our nation's most excellent traditions. The soldiers led by Generals Washington, Jones, Grant, Lee, and Pershing were no different. I also acknowledge that this is an exaggeration, but not a vain one. Our industrial and agricultural output depends on

national sacrifice

and the will to work is great. Our ability to aid other countries determined to resist depends entirely on this will. The people of ravaged countries, if given the opportunity to strike back in the hope of regaining their freedom, also rely on this will for practical assistance. This will of the American people will never be frustrated by threats from foreign enemies and petty, selfish elements within the country. America's determination cannot be hindered by those who profit from war, nor should it be hampered by unnecessary worker strikes, narrow-minded business operations, or intentional slowdowns. We must understand that unless we achieve victory, we cannot run businesses or work, nor can we enjoy freedom. Wise labor leaders and wise business managers will recognize how important it is to engage in shared sacrifice for this great common purpose. The American people should recognize that the current situation is extremely serious, and there is no doubt about it. The reason the American people need a policy is to unite as one and immediately assist Britain, Greece, China, and all European countries whose homelands have been invaded and occupied. From today onwards, our assistance to China, Britain, and Greece will be increased, and will continue to increase until complete victory is won. The great morale of the British people is now stronger than ever. This great morale has enabled the British to endure all the dark days and chaotic, terrifying nights of the past ten months. They have gained the sincere support and assistance of Canada, other dominions, the rest of the British Empire, and non-British peoples around the world who cherish the ideal of freedom. The British people have already

lifted their spirits

to face any invasion that may occur tomorrow, next week, next month, or at any time. In this historically perilous situation, Britain now has a great leader, Churchill. But no one but Churchill can know that Britain's great morale is not only created by Churchill's amazing speeches and courageous deeds. The essence of this spirit of the British people lies within the entire population. The British people's intellect has fully understood a crucial fact: that the British people would rather die as free men than live ignobly as slaves. These ordinary people, whether civilians, soldiers, sailors, or airmen, whether men, women, young, or old, are standing on the front lines of civilization and engaging in war. They are steadfastly defending this front line. This steadfastness will forever be the glory and inspiration of free people on every continent and every island. British allies and their Greek allies need warships. They can obtain warships from the United States. They need airplanes. They can also obtain airplanes from the United States. They need food. They can also obtain food from the United States. They need tanks, cannons, and various military supplies and ammunition. They can also obtain tanks, cannons, ammunition, and various military supplies from the United States. China is now also demonstrating the

great will

of its hundreds of millions of people to resist in order to save its nation from collapse. Under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, China has asked us for help. We, the United States, have answered that China will receive our American assistance. Our country is now doing what our people declared should be done, namely, to be the arsenal of democracy. Our country will now fully fulfill its responsibility. When the dictatorial system collapses (we pray to God that this will happen sooner than any of us dare hope for at present), our country must continue to bear a significant responsibility in the reconstruction of the world. We believe that the ridicule of those dictators, their boasting of being a master race, will all be proven to be Nazi deception and meaningless. For the world has never had, does not have now, and will never have any nation fit to control other nations and be their master. The world certainly does not need any country, relying on the size of its territory and the strength of its military, to rise up and suppress other countries or nations. We believe that any country, no matter how small its territory, has an inherent right to its own existence. We believe that the men and women of such a country, no matter its size, must be able, through peaceful means, to protect human safety, improve healthy living standards, and provide markets for manufactured and agricultural goods, and serve themselves and serve the world. Through such peaceful service, every country will be able to increase its happiness, be able to prevent the horrors of war, and be able to abolish the inhumane treatment of humans by humans. In our country's history, the American people have never encountered such a valuable task. Perhaps our descendants will also rise up and praise us. (United Press Dispatch, 17th)

### Former Prime Minister Luo Passes Away in France

Cannes, France – Former Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Titulescu passed away here tonight at 11:45 PM, at the age of fifty-eight. Mr. Titulescu was born in 1883 in Craiova, Romania. He excelled in his studies at the University of Craiova and, after graduating, went to Paris to study law. Upon returning to his country, he practiced law and gained a growing reputation. In 1912, he was elected as a member of parliament, which marked the beginning of his political career. Soon after, with the outbreak of the European War, he served as Minister of Finance. In 1919, he represented Romania at the Paris Peace Conference. Afterwards, he switched to the diplomatic field, first serving as Minister to Britain and then as Romania's permanent representative to the League of Nations. He returned to his country in 1927 and again served as Minister of Finance. Shortly after, the cabinet was reorganized, and he was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs, a position he held until 1933. He was once again appointed as Minister to Britain, but shortly returned to his post as Foreign Minister, which he held through four cabinet reorganizations. He was renowned for his speeches, which he delivered on several occasions at the League of Nations General Assembly and were extremely well-received. In 1930 and 1931, he was elected as President of the League of Nations General Assembly. However, after the coup in Romania last September, which led to the abdication of King Carol II, he came to France and settled in Cannes, where he remained until his death. (Havas Dispatch, 17th)

Tokyo – Early this morning, a gas explosion occurred in the Mitsubishi coal mine in western Hokkaido. Rescue teams have saved two seriously injured miners and recovered the bodies of six deceased miners. As of this afternoon, 186 miners are still missing. When the explosion occurred, there were 370 miners in the mine shaft, of whom 180 have already escaped. However, engineers say they hope to rescue everyone. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)

### Declaration of the China Journalism Association

Chongqing – The China Journalism Association was established today and issued the following declaration: The organization of the China Journalism Association began in Nanjing. The foundation had just been laid when it fell into Japanese hands. Since the national government moved west, Chongqing has long become the center of the newspaper industry. Journalists from the north and south have mostly come to Sichuan to meet the national crisis. The existing newspaper industry in this city has also made considerable progress in response to the needs of the times. The Department of Journalism at Sichuan University has also been cultivating talents in difficult circumstances and making contributions. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall national propaganda undertaking, Chongqing journalists should take the lead in advocating, gathering fellow professionals from across the country, promoting the established rules of Nanjing, and seeking the advancement of this profession. We have consulted together and agreed to establish this association, initiating preparations for several months now. Fortunately, with the guidance of the Central Propaganda Department and the support of fellow professionals across the country, we were able to hold the inaugural general meeting on March 16th of the 30th year of the Republic of China. We will diligently perform our duties, sharpen our skills, and repay the nation's efforts in resistance and construction with our utmost efforts. Now, at the beginning of this endeavor, we respectfully declare the following based on the consensus of our colleagues and with our sincere intentions: Our country's journalists have a particularly profound and close relationship with the destiny of the nation and the people. Therefore, our colleagues today

first declare that we journalists bear a significant responsibility for resistance and construction. We will always strive to improve ourselves and dare not slacken. If it benefits the nation, we will not hesitate to die. Recalling the late Qing period, from the Xianfeng and Tongzhi eras onwards, the Manchu government was corrupt and defeated, and foreign enemies invaded. The trend of disintegration was already forming, and the disaster of national subjugation was imminent. At that time, patriots and people of virtue both at home and abroad inherited the spirit of thousands of years of history and culture, and were recently influenced by the revolutionary thought of the great Confucian scholars of the late Ming dynasty. They summoned the soul of revival and rose up for revolution. Their only weapon was newspapers and speech. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the greatest visionary of modern China, devoted himself to the national revolution for forty years. Initially, he did not have any military resources to rely on, but only relied on his extraordinary wisdom and passion to express his views and appeal to his compatriots. In his early years overseas, he fought in the realm of speech with the royalist party, painstakingly persuading and educating the government, moving them with his words. Once the Tongmenghui was formed, its official newspaper, Min Bao, directly

guided the Xinhai Revolution. From the founding of the Republic of China until Dr. Sun's death, he devoted his sincere and passionate words to teaching the people, never faltering. Therefore, from the perspective of journalists, Dr. Sun Yat-sen was China's greatest writer, and revolution and speech are inextricably linked. Since ancient times in China, public opinion has resided among the people. Therefore, the advice of hermits has been the mother of all political movements. As we look back today to the late Qing and early Republican periods, our country's forums experienced a time of great prosperity. In addition to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, there were also several senior writers who risked violating the restrictive edicts of the time to criticize the Qing government and instill new knowledge. Although their arguments differed in purity, their contributions to enlightening the people should be remembered by future generations. Moreover, the rise of our country's newspaper industry differs from that of other countries. It was largely established by writers to express their political views and was not intended to be a commercial enterprise. This tradition still remains today. In the early years of the Republic of China, the revolution suffered setbacks, and warlords divided the country. The world of speech

fell into misfortune.

However, after the end of the European War, new trends emerged vigorously. The New Culture Movement and revolutionary thought complemented each other and proceeded in parallel. Although there were many different schools of thought that cannot be discussed exhaustively, they largely aimed to promote new knowledge to save China. After being tempered and forged, all rivers flowed into the sea, and the entire nation was unified under one banner. The Three Principles of the People triumphed in the hearts of the people, and the National Revolution advanced throughout the country. Looking back on the past, we can see that the power of speech is greatly and significantly related to the progress of the nation and the people. However, since modern times, the number of our journalists who have sacrificed their lives due to literary inquisitions is truly unknown. As for small and weak newspapers that have been subjected to political or economic oppression, struggling to operate, and collapsing midway, they are even more numerous. Our country's writers have traditionally regarded themselves as national scholars, so the number of ambitious young people who want to devote themselves to the world of speech is the greatest. However, in the past half-century, amidst the accumulation of domestic and foreign troubles, those who have been able to persist in this profession and stand out have been extremely few. For the most part, they have been

plagued by poverty and hunger, dissipating their ambitions and suppressing their talents, growing old and dying in obscurity. Today, our large group of young professionals has already reached perhaps the nth generation. Today, as we gather in the capital, recalling the difficulties of creating the Republic, remembering the sacrifices made in the national crisis, inheriting the legacy of the senior figures in the world of speech in modern times, and reflecting on the heavy responsibilities that we should bear for history and the people, we sincerely believe that the burden on the shoulders of our few journalists is infinitely heavy. Moreover, having witnessed and experienced the ten years of national crisis, and having been born and died in the four years of war, at this critical juncture of rise and fall, success and failure, we can only be sincerely brave and devote ourselves to serving the country, so that China can achieve its freedom and equality, and all the people can enjoy their happiness and benefit. Only then will our work be considered complete. Only in this way can we be worthy of the heroic spirits of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and other modern Chinese visionaries in heaven, and the history of the national army and people sacrificing themselves for the country in the four years of resistance. Only in this way can we be worthy of the

failed colleagues

of the past decades who had unfulfilled ambitions, and the young people who aspire to the newspaper industry now and in the future. Only in this way can we be worthy of the loyal colleagues who were murdered in the occupied areas, such as Mr. Zhu Xinggong, Zhang Sixu, Shao Xubai, Cheng Zhenzhang, and Jin Huating, as well as the anonymous heroes who are risking their lives to spread propaganda on the front and rear lines. This is the first point of the national colleagues' ambition and awareness to serve the country with loyalty. With the ambition set, what about the method? Journalism is a subject of modern knowledge that originated in Europe and America and was introduced to China. Although it is called a "study," it is a science to be interpreted as such. Our colleagues believe that Chinese journalists must complete a journalism that is unique to China to meet the needs. Western methods should be used for reference only. There is a common saying in our country that governing does not require much speech. Our newspaper industry is also like this. Only by seeking knowledge in work, and outside of work, there is no knowledge. Today, there are many points that domestic newspapers or regular publications should strive to improve, and only by putting them into practice can

improvement be sought.

Empty talk about journalism is useless. Therefore, our colleagues believe that we must build Chinese journalism in the work of resistance and construction propaganda, gather opinions and ideas, and act immediately. This association is willing to mutually help and encourage fellow colleagues across the country to improve together. We hope that fellow professionals across the country will unanimously participate in this association, each striving to fulfill their duties in their respective positions. At the same time, we must always use this association to exchange new knowledge and report situations in order to clarify our principles and benefit the country with our utmost efforts. Now, at the beginning of the establishment of this association, we would like to first declare the general working principles and express our hopes to the government. Our colleagues would like to first state that newspaper reporters are originally one of the free professions, and this is still true today, but the meaning is different. Since the Japanese army invaded, the country is in danger and the people are humiliated, and every citizen has a responsibility for success or failure, rise or fall. The great meaning of resistance and construction today lies in sacrificing all personal freedom, even life, to fight for the freedom and equality of the nation and the people.

freedom and equality.

We journalists, as the wooden tongues of society and the vanguard of the people, should even more absolutely prioritize the interests of the nation and the people. Even life should not be selfish, let alone anything else. Therefore, strictly speaking, Chinese journalists during wartime are all wartime propaganda workers of the state, no longer the free professionals of peacetime. Our colleagues in this association, regardless of our party affiliation, have a unanimous understanding of this point. Therefore, the future working principles will still generally follow the guidance of the Central Propaganda Department, strictly abide by laws and regulations, and respect discipline, in order to jointly seek the common and highest interests of the nation above all and the people above all. However, we wish to state specifically that the great cause of resistance and construction is of utmost importance and complexity. All departments of the state and society should be the object of research and criticism by journalists. China is vast, and the work of resistance and construction is so broad and complex. What is the efficiency of the implementation of government policies and the promotion of social undertakings? Where can improvements be made?

Where are the advantages and disadvantages?

What are the remedies? Moreover, are the policies themselves appropriate, and are the executing officials lawful? All of this is greatly related to the interests of the people and can affect the security of the nation. Recently, we respectfully read Chairman Chiang's speech at the opening ceremony of the National Political Council, which clearly explained the overall situation and exhorted the people. All his propositions are of the highest principle. Our colleagues in this association respectfully accept the leader's instructions and will advocate for the militarization and national defense of the entire country, abandon outdated ideologies and theories, and work together to organize the national struggle. However, at the same time, we recognize that if we want to complete the great cause of resistance and construction, we must constantly review political achievements, publicize the people's concerns, investigate the advantages and disadvantages, and uphold discipline, ensuring that every policy achieves its intended effect and that every person gets what they deserve. This is the aspiration that our journalists should have for the country and the people and should be the practical focus of future journalistic work. We believe that since the outbreak of the war, based on military necessity,

the publishing industry

has been absolutely subject to the management of the wartime system. All of our colleagues are absolutely happy to comply, and there is no disagreement. However, guidance should be limited to principles, and restrictions on news should not exceed the limits of military secrets. As for general policy guidelines, more research and criticism should be added. Our colleagues are making this statement today because, for many years, local officials in various provinces have largely disregarded the rightful position of the press, not allowing criticism of their administration and not wanting the facts to be published. Except for the publication of official documents, the local newspapers throughout the country have almost completely been unable to perform their duties. Since the outbreak of the war, fellow countrymen across the country have embraced the great principle of military first, obeyed government orders, and worked hard to resist and build. However, some officials have not used the name of wartime control to further block the expression of public opinion. Thinking of this, we feel deeply apprehensive. Our colleagues believe that the greatest mission of the nation in the future is to comprehensively review the actual political situation. Let us take the important aspects of wartime politics, such as the promotion of conscription, the supplementary training of recruits,

economic controls,

and transportation. These are all based on local politics and directly affect the success or failure of the military. The matter is trivial and complex, and the scope is broad. We hope that the government will mobilize journalists throughout the country, provide them with convenience and protection, conduct comprehensive investigations, and discuss them truthfully, so as to arouse the enthusiasm of the people and uncover administrative malpractices. This is precisely the way to strengthen discipline and consolidate the foundation of the country. Our colleagues respectfully remember the leader's teachings and are deeply concerned about the mistakes of the defeated countries in Europe. We know that with the accumulated malpractices of our country's politics and society over the past tens of millions of years, we are afraid of following in the footsteps of this history. If we conceal our illness and avoid treatment, and embellish the administration, good policies will not be effective, the suffering of the people will not be able to express their intentions, and a few unscrupulous officials will instead use the pretext of wartime to cover up everything. Then, even with a great and selfless leader and countless patriotic people, the great cause of resistance and construction will still not be able to eliminate the serious obstacles. The Japanese cannot destroy China, but China's self-deception is strange. Our colleagues are making this statement today because we see that the military has already passed the most dangerous stage, and the diplomatic situation is indeed

advantageous.

Looking to the future, the only way is to mobilize public opinion, conduct open reviews, and not conceal or hide anything, and to strictly adhere to the correct awareness of the resistance and construction program, without involving military secrets, without harming its prestige, without affecting the morale of the front lines, and without revealing administrative secrets. The implementation of all policies and the merits and demerits of the executing officials should all be subject to the fair review of the newspapers, and local civil and military officials should not obstruct them. We will use this responsibility to diligently seek knowledge and announce correct public opinion, so that our people across the country can become stronger and stronger in the war and eventually achieve the victory of resistance and construction and the completion of national defense. Our colleagues believe that in this new stage of turning danger into safety, if we can truly reform and make progress, our colleagues in this association, with their writing and labor as their profession and wartime propaganda as their responsibility, with their heavy workload, respectfully express their condolences to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country and their respect for the loyal colleagues in the occupied areas. At the same time, we strongly condemn the extremely small number of people who willingly create false propaganda for the Japanese. Their crimes are serious and despised by the entire nation, but they cannot harm our country and people in the slightest. Finally, we pay our respects to Chairman Chiang and all the officers and soldiers, and deeply thank the guidance of the Central Propaganda Department, and request the assistance of the government and people from all walks of life for this association, so that it can fulfill its responsibilities. This declaration (16th Dispatch)

### Telegrams of Respect to Lin, Chiang, et al.

Chongqing – The China Journalism Association was established in Chongqing on the 16th, and telegrams were sent to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to express respect, to the front-line soldiers to express condolences, and to the families of the deceased journalists to express condolences. The original texts are recorded as follows: Telegram of respect to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang of the National Government: To His Excellency Lin, Chairman of the National Government, and His Excellency Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission: After four years of resistance, national revival is in sight.

### Zhongshan Society Sends Telegram to the Communist Party Representatives

Chongqing - The annual meeting of the Zhongshan Society passed a telegram addressed to Mao Zedong, Lin Zuhan, and other seven participating council members. The original text is as follows: Esteemed Mr. Mao Zedong, Lin Zuhan, Dong Biwu, Deng Yingchao, Wu Yuzhang, Chen Shaoyu, and Qin Bangxian, the government's sanctioning of the New Fourth Army for violating orders and disrupting discipline was truly an unavoidable measure during wartime. The leader's painstaking efforts are evident to all. Your Excellencies, upon accepting the orders of your party, have refused to attend this session of the National Political Council and are making demands and threats. Persuasion from various quarters has been ineffective, causing compatriots at home and abroad to fear a resurgence of internal strife. The members of our society, meeting at this time for our annual gathering, wish to speak to Your Excellencies based on the principle of loving people with virtue. Looking back, when the Father of the Nation aimed for revolutionary progress, he permitted members of your party to join our party in a personal capacity and dedicate themselves to the National Revolution. This was the initial foundation for the confluence of revolutionary forces nationwide, leading to the subsequent surge of the revolutionary tide. However, before the Northern Expedition was completed, your party sought to usurp political power, leading to the division in the fifteenth year of the Republic. It was not until the Xi'an Incident that your party fundamentally changed course, recognizing that class revolution could not succeed in China today and that nationalism would ultimately prevail like the sun and moon in the sky. Then, we reunited with our party, leading to today's sacred war of resistance. After the outbreak of war, your party solemnly declared its recognition of the Three Principles of the People as what China needs today and its willingness to strive for the thorough realization of the Three Principles of the People. Which patriotic person was not inspired? However, time cannot be turned back, and the lives of the people cannot be disregarded. In the past twenty years, due to the errors in the path taken by your party, how many young people have died in vain, and how much of the nation's vitality has been depleted? The painful experience is unbearable to recall. Yet, in recent years, your party's so-called methods of struggle have remained unchanged. Even in the face of the nation's and the people's survival hanging by a thread, you have been unable to suppress your ambition to seize leadership. Instances of outwardly complying while inwardly opposing have emerged endlessly. As Lincoln said, "You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time." Our colleagues deeply believe that sincerity is the foundation of scholarship and politics. The truth of science comes from sincerity, and the morality of politics lies in honesty. Our Chinese nation has always been based on loyalty, kindness, and peace in its conduct. Regarding the theory of revolution, class struggle is ultimately incompatible with China's economic reality. Regarding the methods of political struggle, schemes and conspiracies can never prevail in the long run. How long is our life? Why bother to exhaust ourselves with pretense, waste our strength on internal strife, and cause worry to our patriotic compatriots, inviting ridicule from our eastern neighbors? We firmly believe that warfare and nation-building must be carried out under one ideology, one government, and one leader to achieve success. Your Excellencies have also publicly stated that one ideology is the Three Principles of the People, one government is the National Government, and one leader is Chairman Chiang. However, considering the facts of recent years, where is the support, and where is the obedience? Even the most brilliant propaganda cannot escape the eyes and ears of the world. The failure of one party is a small matter. However, it is unforgivable by the Father of the Nation and the martyrs, and unpardonable by the world and future generations, if the lifeblood of the nation, the youth of the era, are sacrificed without value due to the errors of the leadership's path. Human affairs are all about solving the future, and the completion of personality comes from continuous efforts day after day. This is the objective truth and subjective morality. Indulging in arrogance and selfishness is inappropriate for politicians and certainly not what revolutionaries should do. Your Excellencies are prominent figures in your party and surely cannot bear to see your party repeat past mistakes, adding setbacks to the Chinese revolution. We hope that you will convey the intentions of the members of our society earnestly to the comrades of your party's leadership, first fundamentally changing the unworkable path, confirming that the Three Principles of the People are China's only ideology and that the Chinese Nationalist Party is the sole leader of the revolution. Then, send representatives to sincerely negotiate with our party on how to work together sincerely on both the war of resistance and nation-building. Since your party and our party have shared hardships in revolutionary history and there is no lack of genuine friendship on a personal level, and since four hundred and fifty million compatriots and countless friendly nations are eagerly hoping to see our two parties join hands for national salvation from beginning to end, we should strive to achieve this goal, as it is an objective need of the nation and the world. Accepting advice is the mark of a good person, and failing to act when seeing righteousness is cowardice. We believe that Your Excellencies will not regard the intentions of the members of our society as mere words. (17th dispatch)

### U.S. Government Prepares to Implement Aid-to-Britain Procedures; Unanimous Effort Across Government and Public to Accelerate Production; Lend-Lease Funds Expected to Pass House Soon

Washington - The U.S. government is now preparing to implement aid-to-Britain procedures, increasing military supply orders by more than 60 percent. Consequently, key defense industries are expected to experience a shortage of skilled workers. Yesterday, Knudsen and Hillman, heads of U.S. production management, along with Labor Secretary Perkins, convened representatives from both labor and management in the metal industry. Knudsen stated that the U.S. must now increase production on an unprecedented scale. Our need for machinery for ships, tanks, and aircraft is extremely pressing. Therefore, both labor and management in the metal industry have a responsibility to train more skilled workers in a very short period to meet domestic and foreign needs. He also suggested that the shipbuilding industry should have three apprentices for every skilled worker. (18th Reuters dispatch)

Washington - The House of Representatives will begin discussing the $7 billion lend-lease bill today. This massive bill is expected to pass on Wednesday. The House is also expected to discuss a $40 million national defense appropriation, including 3,600 new bombers for the Army. This bill is expected to pass within a week. (14th Associated Press dispatch)

### Maritime Aid Considered Crucial

Washington - According to current speculation, the U.S.'s active steps to aid Britain will include, firstly, the early transfer to Britain of another batch of over-age destroyers; and secondly, the provision of maritime armed assistance. Congressional circles have spoken definitively about the transfer of old destroyers to Britain, while diplomatic commentators such as Scripp and Hagar Ward's Seymour have also announced that after the President's speech on Saturday, the U.S.'s armed assistance to Britain will certainly be maritime assistance, as it is generally believed. According to Washington sources, Britain is busy dealing with the situation and unable to effectively eliminate the new threat from German submarines. Therefore, the U.S. has no choice but to provide new forms of assistance. This is evident from the President's statement that "the U.S. does not want to stop its assistance until the dictators are completely defeated." All qualified observers feel that the transfer of old destroyers and small warships is only a temporary plan, and what follows will be intervention by the U.S. Navy and the transfer of U.S. merchant ships.

### Stockpiling Raw Materials; Export Restrictions

Washington - Defense officials have submitted a list to the Maritime Commission listing 60 important raw materials and goods from Central and South America, the Far East, etc., including manganese, Manila hemp, rubber, tin, etc., which must be given priority shipping rights on U.S. ships. The items include all items deemed critical by both the Army and Navy, as well as 20 items deemed important by the government. Sources say that the government is planning a revised shipping route plan, which will be announced soon. (18th Associated Press dispatch)

Washington - President Roosevelt signed an order yesterday restricting the export of defense essentials such as machinery, raw materials, blueprints, designs, and detailed specifications. Hereafter, blueprints and specifications for machine guns, airplanes, battleships, and other weapons will not be allowed to be exported. (18th Associated Press dispatch)

### Zhejiang Education Department Vigorously Promotes People's Education in Central Schools; Stipulates Three Points for Counties to Comply With

(Lishui Correspondent) The Zhejiang Education Department stipulates that compulsory education and remedial education for illiterate people should be implemented simultaneously in township central schools and Bao National Schools in accordance with the National Education Implementation Outline. All county township central schools and Bao National Schools should establish a People's Education Department to run adult classes and women's classes. Since the first semester of the 29th year, national education has been implemented. The budgets of various counties have been successively approved. The semester has also ended. However, after reviewing the implementation situation in various counties over the past semester, many schools have neglected the facilities of the People's Education Department. From this semester onwards, the following three points are stipulated: (1) Every national school must compulsorily open adult classes or women's classes, one class each in the first and second halves of the year; (2) Township Bao chiefs can use the method of Bao levy to strictly enforce compulsory school attendance; (3) When the funds for oil lamps, etc., needed by each school are insufficient, adult classes can be changed to morning classes or afternoon classes. The county governments have been ordered to urge and ensure implementation. Supervisors who fail to handle the matter properly and are found to be true will be punished.

### Shanghai United Amusement Association; Ministry of Education Plans to Establish an Orphanage; Shelter Homeless Children and Teach Them Skills

Qian Qiling, Huang Jingwan, Dong Bin, Zhao Xingpu, and others from the Education and Relief Department of the Shanghai United Amusement Association, in view of the recent sharp rise in prices and the increasing hardship of people's livelihoods, have found homeless children on the thoroughfares, following and begging. Even when pedestrians buy food, they are often stolen or even snatched away, almost everywhere. In the future, the more they gather, the more they will affect the foundation and future of the country. Relief should be sought quickly to eliminate hidden dangers. Therefore, the Education Committee was convened to discuss the solution, planning to use the name of the United Association to establish an orphanage to shelter genuinely homeless children in the concession, strictly educate them, and teach them skills so that they can support themselves after their training. If there are wealthy people in the concession who are willing to donate their houses to help establish a homeless children's education program and do not charge rent, borrowing five or six rooms would be sufficient. The goal is to complete this before Children's Day.

### Food - Hoarding Tigers' Greed Knows No Bounds - Subsidies Exceed 4,000 Yuan - The Quality of Rice Sold in the Market is Indistinguishable - Over 40,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai in Succession

The manipulation of foreign rice in the market has worsened, and the black market subsidies are escalating. Major dealers are holding firm, while smaller dealers are taking the opportunity to raise prices. There has been no movement towards an appropriate solution for the rice market, causing widespread anxiety. Speculators are taking advantage of the chaos to maximize illegal profits. Although there is sufficient supply in the market, access to food for ordinary people is becoming increasingly difficult. Small rice shops lack rice to sell, while hoarders remain determined, hoping for conflict. As a result, the subsidy on small package rice, which had never exceeded 4,000 yuan, was broken yesterday. The subsidy per hundred bags jumped from 3,700 yuan to 4,200 yuan, then to 4,300 or 4,400 yuan, the highest level seen in recent black market trading. This translates to a price of 108 or 109 yuan to 111 yuan per metric stone. No. 1 Saigon rice had a subsidy of 3,700 yuan per hundred bags, with rumors of a maximum price of 40 yuan in the dark market for 3,500 bags. No. 2 Saigon rice was at 3,700 to 3,900 yuan. Large package rice was at 3,800 yuan, and even low-quality broken rice required a subsidy of 3,300 yuan. Yesterday, competition between the Shantou gang and retailers in urgent need further tightened the situation. In the afternoon, the market eased slightly, and the total volume of transactions increased to nearly 20,000 bags. Prices are high, but the quality of the rice is increasingly mixed, with low-quality rice sold at high prices. This is truly an unprecedented crisis for the people's food supply in Shanghai.

The rice hoarders are so rampant that even though large quantities of foreign rice arrive in Shanghai daily, the poor are left helpless due to the lack of effective measures. Yesterday, a large shipment of foreign rice arrived. The Taigu Company's Taoyuan ship, carrying 4,685 bags from Hong Kong, arrived yesterday morning and docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession to unload. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship, also from Hong Kong, brought 14,730 bags, along with 1,950 bags of corn, arriving at around 4 p.m. yesterday (customs time) and docking at the Roosevelt Wharf. Unloading continued overnight. Jardine Matheson's Lisheng ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with 1,528 bags of foreign rice, which will be transferred to Qingdao today. Furthermore, the French Company's Khai Dinh ship, directly from Saigon, brought 20,000 bags of foreign rice, which arrived at dawn yesterday and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou to unload. It is rumored that the French Company's Los Angeles ship will also arrive in Shanghai last night, carrying a large quantity of foreign rice from Saigon, the exact amount is pending verification, and is scheduled to dock at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou to unload. It is now rumored that rice hoarders, to avoid potential denunciations, have moved their rice stocks to Pudong and Hongkou, as seen in the unloading of rice from French ships in Hongkou. (Zu)

Although the sales of thick and thin Japonica rice are still sluggish, the black market for foreign rice continues to fluctuate, raising overall market expectations. Owners are unwilling to sell lightly, and strenuous efforts to raise prices have resulted in a reversal from fatigue to tightening for both thick and thin Japonica rice, with prices rising by one or two yuan. Special Japonica rice from Changzhou is quoted at 128 yuan per dan, down to 126 yuan. Kunshan Japonica rice is high from 124 or 125 yuan, to mixed goods at 120 yuan. Original packages from Zhongguan are 106 yuan, and thin Qingjiao rice is quoted at 117 or 118 yuan per dan, with original packages at 125 yuan.

Due to soaring prices, the sales volume of glutinous rice has declined. Most major dealers, seeing profits diminishing, have withdrawn, leaving only some small demand from cake shops and food vendors. Therefore, although owners are trying to raise prices, they are unlikely to succeed. Market prices are mostly unchanged, just average. Hong Kong white glutinous rice is still quoted at 107 or 108 yuan, down to 104 or 105 yuan.

### Large Quantities of Foreign Flour Arrive in Shanghai - Prices Rise Instead - Also Affected by Rising Foreign Rice Prices

Yesterday's flour market, at the opening in the morning, continued the recent downward trend. With the arrival of transshipped flour from Hong Kong, including over 36,000 bags of Jianfu Foreign Company's Bell Tower brand, unloading was underway, so sentiment was calm. Huawu's Australian flower flour allocated to customers was 32 yuan, 34 cents, and Jinlong brand Canadian flour was 31 yuan, 30 cents. However, in the afternoon, the situation turned tight again because foreign rice prices rose again, and speculative hoarders secretly bought up supplies. The market was secretly tight by 20 or 30 cents. It is said that over 100,000 bags of Canadian flour are due to arrive in three or four days, and Chinese factories are continuing to supply flour at flat prices. In reality, the outlook may not be too optimistic, but the current rice price is being raised unilaterally, and the future of the flour market is likely to be affected accordingly.

Foreign Flour: Arriving in Shanghai continuously. The Taigu Company's Taoyuan ship, in addition to bringing over 4,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, also brought a large shipment of flour, totaling 36,771 bags. Jardine Matheson's Lisheng ship also brought 3,000 bags of flour from Hong Kong, and the Yusheng ship brought 5,050 bags. All three ships arrived in Shanghai successively yesterday, totaling 44,821 bags.

Wheat: The market was as quiet as usual yesterday. The supply of domestic durum wheat has long been depleted, and there is a lack of goods in the market. Factories are not in a hurry to buy, as Fufeng Factory has already stopped production, and Fuxin Factory has a temporary supply of newly arrived foreign wheat. Only Japanese factories occasionally buy, but selling prices are extremely high, requiring around 46 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains - Soybeans Drop Slightly by Two Yuan - Speculators Discolored

Yesterday's soybean market experienced a sharp decline, with statistics showing a drop of about two yuan. 250 bags of Qingdao beans were rushed into the market at a price of 47 yuan, 87 bags of Tianjin beans at 49.5 yuan, 170 bags of Jiaozhou beans at 48 yuan, and over 2,000 bags of Guide beans (half of which were absorbed by hoarders) dropped from 46 yuan to 44 yuan. 200 bags of Wuhu beans were priced at 45.78 yuan, and 50 bags of Tianjin green beans at 45 yuan. In short, the various goods not under the cloud of international war have long been the focus of manipulators for clarification. The source of soybeans comes from the Northeast, and the sales route is promoted to Nanyang first. Currently, the sales market is watching and waiting, causing speculators to lose their backing, and the market is showing a collapse. It is feared that other speculators will be affected, and it may not be far off.

### Finance - The Exchange Market, Tight for Four Consecutive Days, Began to Relax Yesterday

The HSBC exchange rate was unchanged yesterday. In the black market for British and American exchanges, because foreign companies have stopped buying, speculators were selling throughout the day, and the supply of funds felt abundant, so the exchange market, which had been tight for four consecutive days, showed a relaxation. However, it was still tight early in the morning because speculators were still closing out long positions. The price of U.S. exchange for next month reached 5.375 yuan. After 10 a.m., Chinese speculators began to sell, and the price of U.S. exchange for March was made to 5.4375 yuan. However, it was reported that British and American banks were absorbing strongly, so the afternoon close recovered. In the subsequent market, speculators continued to sell and ease, coupled with negative rumors, such as the increasingly deteriorating relations between the United States and Germany. However, British banks and Chinese banks were still buying, and the futures and spot prices had slightly widened. The closing price for spot British exchange was 3 pence 3125, and U.S. exchange was 5.4375 yuan, which was lower than the previous day by 0.015625 and 0.0625, respectively.

The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with a spot selling price of 3 pence 2996875 for British gold and 5.375 yuan for U.S. exchange, which was the same as the closing price on the evening of the 11th. After opening, speculators came to the market to close out the U.S. exchange for April, and because foreign banks were willing to sell, the market was still stable. It is estimated that speculators made a profit of 5.375 yuan on the U.S. exchange for April. HSBC's listed price showed no change in the evening. The silver equalization tax is still levied at 24.5%. Subsequently, Chinese speculators suddenly came to sell, and the market turned hard. British and American banks absorbed the U.S. exchange price for this month at 5.4375 yuan. However, it was reported that British and American banks were eating up this price quite strongly, so until the afternoon close, the potential returned to flat. The spot price for British exchange was 3 pence 296875, and U.S. exchange was 5.40625 yuan, which was higher than the morning opening by 0.03125 and 0.03125 respectively.

Futures and Spots are Pulled Apart Later

Speculators continued to sell in the afternoon, and because British banks had profits and Chinese banks were still in strong need, the easing trend was very slight. The U.S. exchange for April generally traded at 5.4375 yuan, and it was unchanged until the evening close. The U.S. exchange futures were slightly tighter than spot. The British exchange futures and spot were both at 3 pence 3125, and the U.S. exchange spot was 5.4375 yuan, with the next month at 5.40625 yuan. Compared to the previous day's price, British exchange futures and spot each increased by 0.015625, and U.S. exchange spot increased by 0.0625, while futures eased by 0.01225.

### Settlement Stopped - Gold Market Reacts - Spot Prices Also Plunge

Yesterday's gold market on the dark market, started to rise and then suddenly reacted and fell, with prices already retreated into the 6,400 yuan level. Firm confidence suddenly became weak. The reason was that it was reported that settlement for importers was no longer available, foreign exchange turned loose, and there were also widespread rumors that friction had occurred again in U.S.-German relations. Therefore, the morning opening was led by a certain gold firm, raising the price to 6,460 yuan, but it soon came out again. Moreover, exchange firms (Xinfeng Yong, Dafeng), securities firms (Xiangxing Yong, Defu), silver firms (Hengji), and gold firms (Rencheng Yong, Hesheng) successively showed a selling trend. The Shanghai West gang even had news of selling, and the price fell by 100 yuan. In the afternoon, a low price of 6,360 yuan was seen.

Gonghe sold 20 liang to Yili, 260 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Yida sold 50 liang to Litai, recovering to 280 yuan higher, still needing to discount a small 70 yuan. Jewelry gold was also lower by 10 yuan, at 680 yuan. Customs gold and others were flat.

Still down by a small 49 yuan

In the early morning, because the buying trend outside the market on the 10th was very strong, the price had already reached 6,450 yuan, so with people's hopes for good, the opening price was raised again, resulting in 6,460 yuan, which was 29 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. However, the transaction volume was very small. It fell immediately after opening, and then retreated to 6,440 yuan. At that time, there were still many transactions. It suddenly rose again by 10 yuan to 6,450 yuan. However, because foreign exchange was no longer settling for foreign firms, the domestic market turned hard and affected the selling side. Firms such as Chengji, Dafeng, Yida, Gongda, and Xinfeng Yong came to sell successively, gradually decreasing to within 6,400 yuan, reaching 6,390 yuan. At this moment, Decheng pulled in, pulling out 400 yuan from the tired situation to 6,410 yuan. Unexpectedly, Hengji, Rencheng Yong, and other floating longs suddenly closed out, pouring out a very large amount, heavily pressing down to 6,375 yuan. At noon, it stabilized slightly, with Zeng Linggao to 6,400 yuan. The closing result was 6,395 yuan. After closing, it was approximately 6,388 yuan. The afternoon opening was lackluster, only 6,380 yuan. Hesheng and Rencheng Yong sold again, and it soon fell to 6,360 yuan, lacking support. Later, relying on firms such as Hengji and Yida to grab at low prices, it finally rose back, but the upward trend was slow. The highest price before closing was 6,391 yuan, and the evening close was 6,382 yuan, 49 yuan lower than the previous day. Calculated according to the settlement price of U.S. dollars for April at 5.40625 yuan, it was 6,441 yuan and 59 yuan. The fluctuation for the entire day was 100 yuan. The selling price of the cash company's own brand gold was about 300 yuan higher than the futures (futures), and the buying was 80 yuan lower than the selling. There was no market for cash gold, etc.

### Yarn and Cotton - U.S.-German Tensions - Yarn Prices Continue to Fall

The yarn market started high and then softened, and the trend was more frustrated. This was due to the return of foreign exchange and the decline in gold, which led to a decline in confidence. At the same time, shorts resumed their activities, and the market tended to decline. However, actual needs were better, and the Hong Kong gang bought about a thousand bags, so the major dealers in the same industry are still in a long position, but those outside the industry are continuing to swap empty positions, so the pressure is still strong. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,420 yuan, and the low price was 1,399 yuan.

### U.S. Cotton Plunges

The current cotton situation is ordinary, and the situation is soft. This is because of the plunge in U.S. cotton, which makes people feel bland. Shenxin No. 2 and 9 factories have a slight need.

The New York cotton market was weak due to selling by foreign merchants, and then plunged due to Washington's news that the government would oppose large loans. As a result, closing prices were more than 20 pounds lower than the previous day.

### British Nationals Negotiate with Japanese Side: Re-election of Municipal Council Directors; Avoiding All Disputes is Deemed the Best Policy; Rumors of Increased Japanese Directors Not Confirmed

The Shanghai Municipal Council stipulated that the next year's new board of directors election would be held on April 2nd and 3rd, and limited foreign national groups to submit the list of candidates to the authorities before the 25th of this month. Now that there are few days left, the future development of the situation can be highly valued. Yesterday, rumors suddenly spread that the British and Japanese sides had reached a compromise, and negotiations are underway to establish a "gentleman's agreement" to reduce the number of British directors and increase the number of Japanese directors. However, this election is based on the Land Regulations of the Yangjingbang area, which is the fundamental law of the International Settlement and should not allow either side to unilaterally change it.

Incumbent Directors to Remain for Another Year

According to a senior official of the British Residents Association, who spoke to a Western newspaper reporter yesterday, the British side here is currently negotiating with the Japanese side and does not intend to hold a vote for the new board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council this year, but intends to ask the current directors to continue to serve for another year. The details of the negotiations, however, cannot be disclosed at present. When inquired of the British official circles about the move to conduct negotiations with the Japanese side to establish a "gentleman's agreement," they also expressed that they were not aware of it. According to another official, this news may have been released by the Japanese side and is still exploratory in nature. However, the Japanese side has not yet expressed its agreement to maintain the status quo, but as far as we know, the Japanese side may make a request to propose more candidates. But generally speaking, this matter has not yet reached a definitive decision.

Rumors of Reduced Number of British Directors

The English-language "China Press" reported that it had learned that a "gentleman's agreement" is currently being drafted between the British and Japanese residents of the city to reduce the number of British directors in the Municipal Council and increase the number of Japanese directors, so it is expected that the number of Japanese director candidates will increase during this year's Shanghai Municipal Council director election. It is reported that the Election Committee of the British Residents Association has recently held several meetings to discuss reducing the number of British director candidates. Although the five current British directors of the Municipal Council have all expressed their willingness to participate in the election again this year, it is generally believed that the Japanese residents have been encouraged to increase the number of Japanese directors in the Municipal Council, and the candidates that the British residents will recommend this year will not exceed four, or only three. It is widely believed that if the British residents only recommend three candidates, then the ratio of directors in the Municipal Council, which was five British, two American, and two Japanese last year, will change this year to three British, three Japanese, one American, and one director candidate from other foreign residents. Local Japanese newspapers have been silent for a long time on the issue of the annual election of directors of the Municipal Council. Yesterday (the 17th) they began to express that the number of Japanese directors in the Shanghai Municipal Council will increase this year, and said that the increase in the number of Japanese directors is "currently underway peacefully, and as a result, the problems encountered by the International Settlement may improve." As of now, only the American residents have definitely recommended Mr. Allman and Mr. Myers as candidates.

MacDonald's Letter Offers Unique Insights

MacDonald, an independent candidate who failed in last year's Shanghai Municipal Council director election, wrote to the English-language "China Press" yesterday morning, expressing that the Western director election system in the International Settlement should be improved because the current system is extremely unfair. The letter stated that British residents in the International Settlement who have the right to vote can cast more than 100 votes per person, and there are also those who have no right to vote, because the property they own is the standard for voting. Currently, there are eight large British companies in Shanghai, and the total number of votes obtained by these eight companies reaches 5,127. There are also 19 British residents who can obtain a total of 3,670 votes. There are 17 British residents with more than 50 votes, totaling 1,324 votes. If property is the standard for voting, then the entire International Settlement is actually ruled by a small number of British people. The letter also stated that the number of votes owned by these eight major British companies is enough to抵(equal) the total number of votes cast in the 1939 International Settlement election of Western directors, and is also enough to抵(equal) the maximum number of votes obtained by Japanese candidates in 1940. Among these eight major companies, Jardine Matheson, Mackinnon Mackenzie, and Wheelock Marden have a total of more than 3,960 votes. It is found that this number of votes can control the British general election votes and rule the International Settlement. Mr. Keswick, representing Jardine Matheson, and Mr. Marden, representing Wheelock Marden, have more than 3,000 votes because of their high social status in Shanghai, and their impact is quite amazing. From 1900 to 1938, the list of attendees and the total number of votes cast at each Western Residents' General Meeting of the International Settlement were printed on the spot for distribution to taxpayers for reference. However, since 1939, this printed material has been cancelled. We are deeply puzzled by the cancellation of this printed material. MacDonald finally discussed that under a democratic political system, such an unfair election with property as the standard should be improved. Moreover, the United Kingdom is currently fighting for a democratic political system, and the election system of the Shanghai International Settlement should be amended.

### Three Years of Confinement in Hankou: Three Foreign Vessels Released; Simultaneously Left Hankou for Shanghai, Having Already Entered Port Yesterday; Rumored to Have Been Leased by Japanese Shipping Company

Since the withdrawal of the Chinese army from Wuhan to the west, foreign vessels anchored outside Hankou have been monitored and detained at their original anchorage, unable to move. Later, in June of the eighteenth year, Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson dispatched the Wuhu and Ruihe vessels to Wuhu to transport British troops for redeployment. The Ruihe originally transported the British troops withdrawing from Hankou back to Shanghai.

Butterfield & Swire's Wuhu

After the vessel arrived in Hankou, it was immediately transferred to the Wulin vessel, which had been trapped in Hankou for a long time, to transport the British troops withdrawing from Hankou back to Shanghai. The Wuhu vessel replaced the Wulin vessel in Hankou to comply with the Japanese military's order prohibiting foreign vessels from moving. Therefore, it is still trapped in Hankou. It is now learned that the Dutch vessels S.S. Wilhelmina and S.S. Beatrice, and the Portuguese vessel S.S. Sado, represented by

Fuh Shun Company

at 150 Jiujiang Road, have been specially permitted by the Japanese military to be released, and the three vessels left Hankou for Shanghai simultaneously on the 14th of this month. The three vessels had been anchored in Hankou for three years, and the hull was in disrepair, inevitably slightly damaged, so the sailing was slower. The estimated journey could be reached today, but the three vessels had already

Entered Port

one after another between 1:10 PM and 2:10 PM (Customs time) yesterday afternoon. The two Dutch vessels were to dock at the Butterfield & Swire wharf in Pudong, and the Portuguese vessel Sado went to the No. 7 and No. 8 buoys in South Huangpu for anchorage. The three vessels are all cargo ships, with a size of five to six thousand tons. They must be docked for repairs. When asked about the future navigation route, the agent Fuh Shun Company did not give a definite answer. According to external news, the three vessels have been leased by the Japanese Yamashita Kisen Co., Ltd. The ability to leave Hankou is also due to the power of Yamashita Kisen Co., Ltd. These three vessels are the first batch of foreign vessels that have been detained in Hankou for three years.

### Japanese Side Monitors Foreign Vessels' Movements: Four Vessels Detained in Zhoushan; Companies Have Not Received Release Report

The four vessels detained by the Japanese side in the Zhoushan waters, the German vessel Moufu, the Italian vessel Changde, and the Shang vessel Xin'anli and Anmanli, have been detained for more than ten days. The respective vessel companies have successively requested the consular authorities to make representations to the Japanese. It was learned yesterday that the Japanese side had informally stated that the vessels would be released soon, resulting in news that they had been released. However, according to inquiries made by a New Voice News Agency reporter last night to the shipping department of the Moufu vessel, the respective companies have not yet received a telegram confirming the release, so the rumors are difficult to verify. Everyone believes that at this time when the Japanese side is expanding the scope of the blockade, they will further monitor the movements of foreign vessels. The detained vessels may have to be anchored for a considerable period of time. The respective companies are now waiting for news. If the vessels are not released indefinitely, they are prepared to submit further representations. After the closure of the Haikou and Dongshi ports, no sailing vessels have continued to export since yesterday. The Ruitai and Mali vessels, which cleared customs last week, have not reported their whereabouts since exporting.

### Soaring Rice Prices are the Main Cause: Labor Unrest is Becoming More Serious Again; French Tramway Mechanics Go on Strike; Meifeng Cotton Mill is Vandalized by Workers

The French Tramway Company previously experienced a strike that lasted for many days. It was not until the authorities intervened that work resumed. However, disputes arose again later, but there was no further major strike. Although there were some details that were not agreed upon by the labor and management, they were not enough to hinder the harmony between labor and management. Not long ago, the labor side caused labor disputes due to the "union" fee issue, which was also resolved soon. Recently, the labor side brought up the old matter again, causing the mechanics department workers to request the management to fulfill some of the details that had been discussed before, and because they did not receive a response, the workers in this department suddenly went on strike at about 1:00 PM yesterday.

Mechanics' Strike Temporarily Suppressed

After learning about the strike, the French police, fearing that it would cause trouble, dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene for alert. At the same time, the political department also sent personnel to investigate. Fearing that the situation would escalate, the management agreed to respond on the 25th. However, the labor side was still dissatisfied. Later, the political department persuaded them to resume work quickly to avoid hindering the work, and that all the conditions that had not been agreed upon before would be resolved in the shortest possible time. The labor side then agreed and immediately resumed work.

Photo Engraving Industry Raises Conditions

In recent years, rice prices have soared, and everything is expensive. According to the worker's cost of living index published by the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 28th of last month, it has exceeded several times before the war. The lives of ordinary salary earners and low-level wage workers have deteriorated even more. There are more than 20 photo engraving industries in Shanghai, with a total of seven or eight hundred employees (including those attached to various newspapers and bookstores). It is reported that the average salary of employees is about 30 yuan, and the average is less than 25 yuan. However, there is no regulation on working hours, and sometimes it even exceeds 14 hours. Before the war, it was still possible to maintain a family of several people with this level of living. However, since the war, the treatment has not improved, and the lives of the employees have long been in a state of semi-starvation. Because of the high pressure of life, their families have repeatedly requested the management to improve their treatment. Most employees, feeling the special environment, understanding the need for labor-management coordination, and enduring the pain, are unwilling to act rashly. Now, in order to further express their demands, the employees have put forward specific requirements to the management. If their lives cannot be resolved, they will go on strike to urge the management to understand. It is reported that the price of photo copper and zinc plates was at most 8 cents per square inch before the war, but later, due to the increase in raw material prices, it rose to 1.5 cents, then to 2 cents, and soon to 2.5 cents. Since March 1, the new price has risen to 5 cents per square inch.

Bookbinding Industry Asks for Double Salary

Due to the impact of rising prices, the bookbinding workers in the book industry are experiencing difficult lives. Now all the workers have requested the management to increase their wages by two times to solve their urgent needs. Before the January 28th Incident, the wages for male and female workers in this industry were 1 yuan and 10 cents per 10,000 pages. Although wages were increased to 1 yuan and 34 cents to 56 cents per 10,000 pages from October of last year, they still felt that it was not enough due to the soaring prices.

Cotton Mill's Strike Spreads

Recently, all the workers in more than 50 cotton mills in the city went on strike because their request for management to improve their treatment was not granted. For a time, the workers in other factories responded in groups. Only the workers in the Meifeng Cotton Mill at 112 Pinlang Road, West Shanghai, did not participate and continued to work as usual. The striking workers believed that they were disrupting the strike, so they sent people to the factory the day before yesterday, threatening that they must join the strike yesterday. Until yesterday, the workers in the factory still worked as usual. The striking workers learned about this and gathered 200 workers at noon yesterday to rush to the factory, destroying the glass doors and windows and miscellaneous items in the factory to prevent work from being carried out. After receiving the news, the police quickly dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene to suppress the strike and arrested several workers who caused the trouble.

### Tomorrow is the Anniversary of the Recovery of Songhu: Celebrations Enthusiastically Held by All Sectors; Loyal Comrades' League Encourages Compatriots

Tomorrow (January 28th) is the anniversary of the recovery of the Songhu area by the National Revolutionary Army. All sectors of the city are unanimously preparing to celebrate enthusiastically. However, due to the special environment, it has been decided not to hold any ceremonies, but to uphold the policy of resistance and national reconstruction with perseverance, and to complete the mission of final victory. The Loyal Comrades' League of the Kuomintang also issued a letter to the compatriots of the city as follows:

Recalling today in the 16th year of the Republic of China, Generalissimo Chiang led the army on the Northern Expedition, and the party army advanced to the shores of Shanghai. The army and people cooperated to recover the local area. The Shanghai party members rose up in anger, and the masses responded. The warlords collapsed at the sight of the wind and fled in panic. For more than ten years, the remnants of evil have been swept away without a trace. Local tyrants and evil gentry have been executed to eliminate harm for the people and punish traitors for the country. National prestige has been restored, and the people's spirit has been revived. The Republic of China has been reborn, thanks to the sincerity of our Generalissimo and the loyalty and bravery of our party's advanced members. At that time, our party comrades were truly "vanguards of the people, working tirelessly day and night," so they were able to create this glorious and great historical record that will last forever. At this time, the Generalissimo is supervising the army in battle, and the news of victory from the front-line generals is frequently reported. The final victory can be expected soon. I hope that our Shanghai comrades will work even harder, lead the masses, be loyal to the party and the country, and not hesitate to die. We will emulate the fighting spirit of the martyrs and add glory to our Songhu commemoration. Let us encourage each other.

### Rice and Cloth Situation Worsens Daily: Emergency Measures are Urgently Needed; There is no Shortage of Precedents for Taking Special Measures; Poor People are Robbing Rice Again, Order is Already Concerning

The English-language "China Press" reported that semi-official figures predicted today (the 18th) that the result of the extraordinarily high rice prices in Shanghai would be rampant thieves and repeated robberies and other crimes. It is said that the city authorities should immediately take "decisive measures" to prevent this danger.

Authorities Should Adopt

Half of the measures currently adopted by the Municipal Council can be said to be illegal. For example, with regard to the curfew, the Municipal Council has no sovereignty to enforce it, but the council enforces the curfew and arrests people during the curfew for the sake of public safety and the interests of the International Settlement. This is an extraordinary measure. Accordingly, the Municipal Council can also adopt extraordinary measures to prevent the rice situation from worsening. The actions of the Municipal Council only need to be approved by the Consular Body. Any action taken for the benefit of the citizens will undoubtedly be supported by the Consular Body.

Poor People Rob Rice on Broadway Road

This morning, there was another incident of poor people robbing four bags of rice carried by a wheelbarrow on Broadway Road, which shows that the rice situation is worsening. Rice prices continued to rise today. The authorities of the International Settlement officially announced this morning that a board meeting will be held tomorrow afternoon (the 19th) to discuss the city's rice situation, or they will agree on measures to control rice speculation and hoarding, which will be adopted by the Municipal Council.

Today's Meeting is Worth Noting

The authorities of the two settlements are actively carrying out effective and concrete measures to stabilize the rice market. However, for the sake of prudence, after a certain measure is drafted, it must be studied several times to ensure that it has effective results after implementation. In view of the fact that rice merchants, who are driven by profit, are rampant and rice prices are rising endlessly, the contacts have been unusually busy in recent days in order to implement effective measures and stabilize the people's food as soon as possible. According to rumors, the Food Subcommittee of the Shanghai Municipal Council held another consultation yesterday afternoon and put forward all the existing stable food measures for discussion. The members all expressed better opinions. The established plan will be submitted to today's regular meeting of the Municipal Council for discussion and decision-making.

Price Evaluation Measures are Equal to Setting Up a Sham

According to a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency, the Rice Trade Association had sent representatives to visit Mr. He Dekui of the Shanghai Municipal Council to discuss the current difficulties in purchasing and retailing foreign rice that exceeds the limited price by more than 20 yuan, and asked for a solution. Mr. He agreed to consider it, so a decision will also be made at today's meeting. A reporter learned from the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Association yesterday that the association did not hold a meeting yesterday, but it is understood that the association had prepared a report and submitted it to the Municipal Council, detailing the difficulties in implementing the prices of various grades of foreign rice evaluated on February 3. However, the association is almost equivalent to setting up a sham when rice merchants are rampant. If the authorities do not issue new instructions and strictly supervise, it will be difficult to have an effective effect on stabilizing the rice market.

### America Clearly Expresses: Will Not Hesitate to Resort to Force; Strive to Help China Sanction Aggression; Roosevelt Gives Final Warning to Japan; English-Language "China Press" Commentary Yesterday

The English-language "China Press" commented that we hope that Japanese politicians can read President Roosevelt's speech in detail. We also hope that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka, who is on a journey in Siberia, Japanese naval officers on the coast of Vietnam, and Japanese army officers south of Yichang can also close their eyes, think deeply, and understand the remarks made by President Roosevelt. We have this hope because this move will definitely be beneficial to the country's future.

Accepting Provocations, No Longer Tolerating

When President Roosevelt and other American leaders make speeches condemning aggressors, the first to be criticized must be Germany. However, if the Japanese believe that the United States has no resentment towards them, they are completely wrong. In his speech, the President has almost clearly stated that the United States will never allow Japan to further invade American interests, and also stated that if Japan continues to make provocative moves in Malaya and the South Pacific, the United States will take action. In short, if Japan wants to "stir up trouble" and "ask for trouble", then they can achieve their wishes at this time, because the United States will no longer retreat. The President's speech is also tantamount to warning Japan that you have made grand pronouncements in the past, repeatedly made false threats, and bullied small and weak nations. You have raised your fists and drawn your swords, wanting to try it out, so why not just come and try it. However, you will eventually find that we are now prepared.

Deeply Hating Aggressors

What the President's speech shows is that America's enemy is not just Germany. All Axis countries engaged in aggression are America's enemies. Once Japan colludes with Germany to form an alliance against democratic countries, the United States will recognize Japan as being in the same camp as Germany and Italy. From the perspective of the United States, it deeply hates all aggressors and will not discriminate based on the geographical boundaries of Europe and Asia. Since Japan has fallen into the quagmire with clumsy actions, how to get out of this abyss depends on Japan itself. If it only relies on making false claims to seek to extricate itself, the result will be that it will sink deeper and deeper until it is beyond rescue.

Decided to Help China in Heroic Battle

We have an even greater hope that the Japanese people can also read the President's speech carefully, because we hope that the Japanese people can study the following American sentiments: "Our goal should be to make the dictatorships in both Europe and Asia no longer doubt our unity." "The Nazi Party and all those hypnotized by it call this political system a new order." This system is neither "new" nor "orderly". We firmly believe that when our production reaches sufficient levels, the democratic countries of the world will be able to prove that dictators cannot win. We also now have every spare airplane and every other piece of combat equipment, whether new or old, and we will send them abroad." "America is not a country surrounded by appeasers, defeatists, and manufacturers of terror from the back door." "The enemies of democracy have miscalculated, thinking that democracy cannot adjust itself to cope with the terrible facts of the war world." "China...under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, hundreds of millions of people are making heroic and great resistance. They are now calling to us, and America has told China that they will get our help." "Our country will implement the slogan of our people and become the arsenal of democracy."

Devoted Effort, Will Not Hesitate

Even among the American people, there is no shortage of those who doubt how America can defeat the Axis countries. However, the President announced to them that America will make every effort until it defeats the Axis countries. To what extent can the Axis countries be defeated is not considered. The American people no longer have any fear. This effort by America has reached its highest point. This 100% effort will not be stopped because the sacrifices are too great. We really hope that the Japanese people will no longer have any doubts after hearing the President's speech.

### Medical and Pharmaceutical Industries Help Promote Tuberculosis Prevention Movement

The Tuberculosis Prevention Movement, jointly initiated by leaders from all walks of life in the city and the new medical and pharmaceutical industries, held a joint medical conference at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. The attendees included Chairman Xu Xiaochu, Yuan Ludeng, Zhao Zhiyou, Ding Fubao, former President of the Physician's Association Yu Yunxiu, Dean of Tongde Medical College Gu Yuqi, representative of the Chinese Medical Association Chen Yuru, and more than 30 people including presidents of various hospitals, including Zhang, Gu Nanqun, Tang Yuhan, Zhu Kewen, Jin Rong, and Wang Wanbai. Secretary-General Ding Huikang reported on the trial of the first Tuberculosis Prevention Movement, saying that residents came for examinations very enthusiastically. As a result, a quarter of them were found to have lung diseases and were given free X-ray photography. He deeply felt that this kind of relief work related to national health is not something that can be done by one person or one unit. It is necessary to concentrate the city's medical equipment, cooperate, and jointly eliminate the invisible enemy. Then, Mr. Yuan Ludeng requested that the examination method of this session be improved, and it was proposed that major hospitals should provide free X-ray examinations. Patients who need X-ray photography should be charged the lowest possible fee per film in order to popularize diagnosis. The presidents and physicians of major hospitals present enthusiastically supported this proposal and unanimously passed it. After the decision, Gu Yuqi and Yu Yunxiu successively gave speeches, and bacteriology experts Zhu Yangao, Cheng Mugu, and Yu Yunxiu expressed their willingness to undertake free chemical examination work. Finally, Mr. Xu Xiaochu delivered a speech, saying that new medicine and new drugs are related, and hoped that the medical and pharmaceutical industries will closely cooperate and jointly promote this undertaking for the relief of people's lives. It is reported that the free X-ray examination method passed at the meeting will be held simultaneously in 12 hospitals, including Zhongbi, Da Shanghai, Da Gong, Da Rui, Hongqiao, Nanyang, Tongde, Jardine Matheson, Shanghai Lung Disease, Zhang, and Qu Zhifu, starting from the 16th of next month, which is truly good news for the residents of the city.

### Rotary Club Regular Meeting This Week: Welcoming New Members

The Shanghai Rotary Club's small weekly meeting, which is not open to the public, is scheduled to be held at the Ducheng Hotel at noon on March 20th (Thursday). At that time, a new member induction ceremony will be held and various important issues of the club will be discussed. It is hoped that members from both local and other places will actively participate.

### On the Supreme Principle of All Religions

In the eleventh lecture of the Harmony Five Scripture Study Society, Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke on "The Supreme Principle of One" in all religions, saying: The "Doctrine of the Mean" in the Book of Rites states: "What Heaven imparts is called Nature; to follow Nature is called the Way; to cultivate the Way is called Instruction." It also says, "The Way is that from which we may not deviate for an instant; what may be deviated from is not the Way." Instruction is established based on the Way. If it departs from the Way, where does Instruction exist? The Way arises from following Nature; if not for Nature, where is the Way to be seen? Though there are five Instructions, the Way is only one. To know that the highest philosophies are not different is to know that they are the same in "One." The "Explanation of Characters" (Shuowen Jiezi) explains the character "一" (One) as, "The Way is established in One." Xu Shuozhong, unparalleled in the Five Classics, his saying is trustworthy and verifiable. The Way is established in One; thus, "One" is the origin of the Way. Let us cite the teachings of various religions to demonstrate this.

Confucianism

Since Fu Xi created the Bagua with a single stroke, opening the heavens and establishing instruction, the sages have passed it down, jointly elucidating the principle of "Only One." Xunzi's "On Ritual" states, "The Way of the hundred kings is simply One." Mencius's "Teng Wen Gong" states, "The Way is only One." These all inherit Confucius's saying, "My Way is consistent with One," and "I connect everything with One." What exactly does "One" mean? Jia Gongyan's commentary on the Zhouli (Rites of Zhou), Xing Bing's commentary on the Xiaojing (Classic of Filial Piety), and Kong Yingda's commentary on the Zuozhuan (Zuo Commentary to the Spring and Autumn Annals) all say, "One is the beginning of numbers." Wang Bi's commentary on Laozi also says, "One is the beginning of numbers and the limit of things." The beginning is described in the "Dry Plan of the Weft of the Yi," "The Yi begins with One," the "Spring and Autumn Metaphysical Destiny Wrap," "The nature of yin and yang arises from One," the "Da Le" in the Lüshi Chunqiu, "Created from Taiyi (Grand One)," the "Li Yun" in the Book of Rites, "Rooted in Taiyi." The limit is described in the "Life Instructions Explanation" of the Lost Zhou Book, "Its limit is One." Therefore, Yu Fan's "Meaning of the Yi" says, "Taiji is Taiyi." Hui Dong's "Notes on Reading the Shuowen" says, "One is Taiji." Furthermore, according to the annotation on the chapters "On People," "The Ruler's Duty," and "The Principles of Transgression" in the Lüshi Chunqiu, "One is the Way." Its annotation on the "Spiritual Instructions" in the Huainanzi says, "One refers to the Way," and "One is the Way." Yu Chuozhen annotates, "The origin of the Way," and "The gate of the Way." Guiguzi's Yin Fu says, "The Way is the beginning of heaven and earth, One is its discipline." Lu Dian's annotation on Guanzi says, "One is the beginning of primordial qi," and Liu Xin's "Three Unifications Calendar" says, "The Way relies on its One." Thus, Han Fei's "Yang Quan" states, "The Way is unparalleled, therefore it is called One." Shao Kangjie's "Innate Learning" says, "Heaven differentiates and transforms within One, and humans create order in their hearts." His explanation is clear and detailed. Furthermore, the "Outer Chapters on Observing Things" state, "The heart is Taiji," and "The Way is Taiji," which is the same as the ancient "Three Tombs," "One is Taiji." If so, nature, numbers, qi, yin and yang creation, rites, music, laws, and governance all begin with One, which is to say they all originate from the Way. Truly, Zhao Qi's commentary on Mencius says, "That which settles the world is but One Way." Therefore, the Doctrine of the Mean states that the three universal virtues and nine standards are "the means by which to practice it." Hence, we know that "One" is the origin of philosophy.

Taoism

Zhuangzi's "Heaven and Earth" quotes, "It is recorded that understanding One completes all things." This inherits Laozi's meaning of "Embracing One" and "Attaining One," and the Yi Jing's principle of "Constancy in One" and "Attaining Oneness." Liu Xi said, "Considering all things, this One determines them." Han Bo said, "One penetrates all, exhausting everything without contemplation." The "Ring Flow" chapter of Guanzi states, "Emptiness is called One." Yin Zhizhang annotates the "Inner Governance" of Guanzi, "One refers to nothingness." Meng Jingyi discusses, "One is called the subtle." Li Shan's annotation on the Selections of Refined Literature says, "Subtle existence is called One," which is the same as Zhuangzi's "unformed," Huainanzi's "formless," Lüshi Chunqiu's "cannot be formed," and Guo Xiang's "having spirit" and "utmost subtlety," all referring to the Yi Jing's "Spirit is without direction, and change is without substance," and the Tai Xuan's "Darkly extending myriad categories without showing its form." The Six Secret Teachings quotes, "The Yellow Emperor said, 'One is the ladder to the Way, nearly divine.'" Ruan Ji's "General Discussion on Laozi" states, "The Yi calls it Taiji, the Spring and Autumn Annals call it Yuan (beginning), and Laozi calls it the Way." The "Sayings of Mingdao" states, "Its location is called Yi, its principle is called the Way, and its function is called Spirit." "Zhengmeng" in the "Participation and Opposition" chapter states, "One is therefore spiritual," and also says, "Existence and non-existence, concealment and manifestation, spiritual transformation, nature, and life are all unified without duality." Therefore, to call it Yi, Xuan (mystery), the Way, Spirit, or Subtlety are all different names for the use of the same "One" essence.

Buddhism

The Four Gates of the Tripitaka state, "Non-duality is called One," and "Not one, not different, is named Oneness." The commentary on the Avatamsaka Sutra states, "The One True Dharma Realm is the profound and subtle body." The "Expedient Means" chapter of the Lotus Sutra states, "In the Buddha lands of the ten directions, there is only the One Vehicle Dharma. Only this One Reality exists; the other two are not true." The "Treasure Cave" states, "The One Vehicle is the ultimate Way without duality, therefore it is called One." The "Essentials of Transmitting the Mind" states, "One is all, and all is One." Zen Master Yongjia said, "One nature perfectly penetrates all natures, one dharma universally contains all dharmas, and one moon universally appears in all waters." This is because cause and effect are non-dual, the capable and the capable are as one, and all transformations are included in the "One" of my Buddha.

Christianity

Ephesians 4:6 states, "One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all." God is also translated as "Spirit," which is "Monotheism" and "The Uniqueness of God." Therefore, John 1, 4, and 14 take God as the Way, the Truth, and the source of life.

Islam

The Celestial Ritual Classic states, "Only present the True Sovereign, Unique and without form, Lord of the great earth, creating people and things." The Hidden Secret Classic states, "The One Truth evolves, principles and phenomena are displayed." The "Investigation of the Origin of the Way" states, "One Reality is divided into ten thousand, human and divine principles are complete." In the interpretation of the Five Pillars, it uniquely emphasizes the principle of "Oneness of Nature." This all-knowing and all-powerful Lord of Christianity and Islam is the "Spirit" without fixed form or substance of the Yi Jing.

### University Student Cheng Zeyi Abducted Midway But Fortunate to Escape. Police Chase After Bandits, Who Push Cheng Out of the Car. Bandits Speed Away Without a Trace, Car Missing.

Cheng Zeyi, a 24-year-old Fudan University student from Suzhou residing at No. 3, Lane 834, Connaught Road, was riding in his private car, license plate 3895, yesterday at noon. Cheng was driving himself, intending to return home for lunch, when suddenly two bandits, one armed with a Mauser pistol and the other with a handgun, blocked his path on Xinzha Road. They jumped into the car and sped off west. As they approached the wire mesh barricade at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road, the bandits, fearing a search by the guards, accelerated through the barrier and onto Yuyuan Road. The officers stationed near the barrier, seeing the car suddenly break through, suspected something amiss and gave chase, sounding their sirens. Realizing their predicament, the bandits stopped in front of the Yunfei Motor Company branch, pushed Cheng out of the car, and sped away without a trace. Although Cheng escaped abduction, the car remained missing as of last night.

### Japanese Resident Forcibly Drives Car, Destroying Shopfront. One Japanese Person Arrested On the Spot.

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that at 5:30 AM this morning (the 18th), three Japanese individuals emerged from a gambling den on Haig Road, boarded a Xiang Sheng taxi, and proceeded east on Avenue Edward VII. Zhuji, the Japanese individuals instructed the driver to head to Hongkou. When the driver refused because Xiang Sheng taxis do not travel to the northern districts, one of the Japanese men attempted to seize the steering wheel, while the other two restrained the driver. As a result, the driver lost control, the wheels veered, and the car crashed into the storefront of a Chinese shop at No. 11 of Avenue Edward VII. The car sustained heavy damage, and the merchandise in the window was destroyed. However, neither the driver nor the Japanese individuals were injured. French Concession police arrived at the scene upon hearing the commotion. Two of the Japanese individuals had already fled. Only one Japanese person was arrested and subsequently handed over to the Japanese Consulate Police for questioning.

### Gambling Den Thugs Impersonate Officers, Extorting Money. Deception Uncovered, Arrests Made.

Ma Changsheng (30 years old, residing at No. 1, Leyi Lane, An'na Yu Road, Nanyang Bridge), Bao Chongzheng (31 years old, from Pudong), and Zhang Wencai (same age as Bao, residing with him on Yuyuan Road), all from Shanghai and formerly special police officers in the French Concession, and currently working as "保鑣" (bodyguards/table supporters) at the Six Nations Hotel on Haig Road in western Shanghai. The three individuals, with a sudden burst of inspiration at around 7 o'clock the night before, impersonated French Concession detectives and went to the home of Dong Yuzhen, a paint merchant residing at No. 32, Xingsheng Street, accusing him of selling opium and demanding money. Dong saw through Ma and the others' fraudulent intimidation and pretended to cooperate, offering them warm hospitality while secretly using the telephone to inform the French Concession police. A large group of detectives were immediately dispatched to arrest Ma, Bao, and Zhang, along with the victim Dong Yuzhen, and taken to the police station for investigation and prosecution.

### Yuan Chang Yarn Firm Massive Fraud Case. Thirty-Four Households Deceived. Fraudulent Funds of Hundreds of Thousands After Thirteen Days of Business. Case Complex, Police Investigating Rigorously.

The yarn exchange market in this city recently experienced a period of chaos. The reason for this was that the Yuan Chang Yarn Firm, No. 6, Lane 457, Ningbo Road, broker in the market, sold a large number of forged Yu Feng Yarn Factory warehouse receipts. After the customers discovered the fraud, they reported it to the Central Police Station. Chinese detectives Yang Peisheng and Kang Zengxiang and others arrested Yuan Chang employees Wang Yating, Pan Zeru, and Tao Yuantai. The manager of the firm, Zhou Zhonghou, has fled. Detectives investigating the case have discovered that in addition to Zhou Zhonghou, there were also Su Zuyu and Wu Mingzeng who manage the firm. Su is the owner of the Nanyang Cloth Factory on Shanxi Road, and Wu is an assistant manager at the Jiaxiang Cotton Cloth Shop on Shandong Road. Thirty-four households have been defrauded and the amount of money defrauded has reached 530,000 yuan.

List of Defrauded Firms

Total (1) Dadecheng 15,720 yuan, (2) Yuansheng 7,440 yuan, (3) Leji 7,880 yuan, (4) Qingyu 7,780 yuan, (5) Huichang 17,380 yuan, (6) Yongfu 18,990 yuan, (7) Yongfeng 8,700 yuan, (8) Yongji 17,740 yuan, (9) Yiji 8,720 yuan, (10) Hongren 17,400 yuan, (11) Yongshengfeng 26,040 yuan, (12) Leji 8,650 yuan, (13) Jiuji 8,610 yuan, (14) Fengtai 8,690 yuan, (15) Xiangfeng 20,220 yuan, (16) Yiji 17,720 yuan, (17) Guangweixin 26,650 yuan, (18) Yongfengyu 8,875 yuan, (19) Zhenfeng 9,010 yuan, (20) Dafeng 17,658 yuan, (21) Dadecheng 8,790 yuan, (22) Taichang 8,800 yuan, (23) Tongbaoxiang 17,600 yuan, (24) Juda 8,810 yuan, (25) Qinji 17,440 yuan, (26) Defeng 8,745 yuan, (27) Changtai 53,030 yuan, (28) Zhenfeng 17,490 yuan, (29) Rongfeng 8,720 yuan, (30) Xinkang 8,710 yuan, (31) Hongli 17,420 yuan, (32) Tongshengquan 17,600 yuan, (33) Changfeng 17,580 yuan, (34) Ruichangxing 26,440 yuan. When the police solved the case, they learned that some of the customers had not yet collected the cheques they had paid. Therefore, they immediately applied to the court for a stop-payment order and managed to seize 150,000 yuan. However, 386,000 yuan had already been withdrawn.

Complex Inside Story

In total, the Yuan Chang firm operated for only thirteen days, but its earnings amounted to a huge sum of money. The speculative atmosphere can be seen. In the afternoon, the case was heard by Judge Feng of the Special First Court. The defendants hired lawyers such as Wan Weijian and others to defend them. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted them for forging documents and defrauding property under the criminal law. He also said that when the police went to various money houses and banks for payment, 8,660 yuan at the Fukang Money House had not been withdrawn. They immediately notified the money house to temporarily stop payment, which the money house agreed to. However, when the court's stop-payment order was delivered in the afternoon, the money had already been withdrawn. Whether the money house is suspected of assisting is something that the police may have to prosecute. Also, Ruichangxing and Shenyu, two of the plaintiffs, did not immediately report the forged warehouse receipts, but instead went to Wuchang to obtain money paid by other firms to compensate for their own losses. This is illegal, and the police are considering whether to prosecute them. Also, the Yuan Chang firm has a shared account at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank. The Yanyie Bank has a shared account, and the introducer of the shared account is Wu Yuji. The police's investigation found that Wu Yuji is the wife of a giant Wu in a certain institution in western Shanghai. The investigation is still ongoing. After Judge Feng questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be detained for further questioning at a later date.

### Mortality Rate in the Southern Concession Continues to Rise

The weather in this port has been warming up recently, but after a sudden change in climate a few days ago, influenza and gastroenteritis have become widespread. The mortality rate of residents has not decreased slightly. According to a report from the Department of Health of the Municipal Council, 1,132 Chinese and 13 foreigners died in the Public Concession last week. There were 195 Chinese and 3 foreigners in the French Concession. In total, there were 1,243 deaths. The number of resident deaths has been increasing in recent months, and the health of residents is cause for concern.

### "There's No Way"

— Jue Hui

Nowadays, there are so many people who rely on "there's no way" to eat and do things, as many as bugs in June!

Some are "straight to the point": "There's no way to do this!"

Some are "roundabout": "We have to find a way in a situation where there's no way!"

Some are "rubber band style": "Saying there's a way is really no way; saying there's no way maybe there's still a way."

The result? All roads lead to Rome, it's all just "there's no way"!

In fact, things depend on people's actions. There is absolutely no such thing as "there's no way" in the world. If you are determined that "there's no way," then that is truly "there's no way"!

Furthermore, solutions don't come to people; instead, people have to go find solutions. Otherwise, when "black and white" become indistinguishable, there will be "no" solutions either.

Do you want to find a solution when there is a way? Or do you want to find a solution when there is no way? (Besides, the solution has long been there, you just need to "do" it).

### The Car's Soliloquy

— Zhi Ru

Darkness and stuffiness fill my little house, making me feel bored and annoyed. It's already late spring, but I'm still wearing thick, hard steel armor. I think this might shorten my life. I've wanted to leave many times, to get out of this demonic cave. I don't want darkness and a prison-like life; I want light, I want freedom. But I'm locked up by that "fellow," so I'll never move on my own, let alone leave this little house.

Finally, the lock opens and that "fellow" walks in. He opens the lock with a small bunch of metal things, then climbs into my belly and controls my organs. I slowly crawl out. That "fellow" is not a good thing. I remember; he often mistreats me. When I'm hungry, he never gives me a drink until I get sick and can't move. Then he cleverly brings the owner to take a look. The owner gives him a few colorful pieces of paper, and only then does he give me some "food" and I regain my usual spirit and action... In short, that "fellow" is not a good thing. Today he's here again to command me to go out. I guess there won't be any rest tonight.

Now I'm flying on a flat road. He controls my organs and doesn't slow down because of the cold wind or the crowded pedestrians, but just speeds forward like the wind. Suddenly, at a crossroad, a thin, tall person is walking slowly. That "fellow" seems to be blind and continues to make me fly forward like a shot. I'm scared, I'm scared I'll hit him and make him bleed! Stop! Yes, I want to shout: "Get out of the way! Get out of the way!" But that "fellow" seems to have forgotten to press my organ. Closer! Closer! My body is shaking a little. I want to shout, but I can't. Finally, I'm cruelly run over by that "fellow." At that moment, that "fellow" seems to realize it and shouts and curses in a rough voice, and presses my organ with his hand, but it's too late. My shout is not what I wanted to shout just now: Get out of the way! Get out of the way! But! Alas! Dead, alas! A sigh of death. The owner also wakes up from his reverie and subconsciously sticks his head out to take a look at the people surrounding him and the dead man lying on the ground -- beside my body. "Oh!" He doesn't seem afraid or cold-hearted about this tragic bloodshed, just hums like this lightly.

A man in yellow clothes comes over and talks to the owner for a few words. The owner takes a few colorful pieces of paper and proudly tells that "fellow" to make me crawl again. On the owner's smiling face, he seems to be saying: It's okay! It's okay! I don't understand how the magic power of these colorful papers is so great. That "fellow" has the colorful papers and comes to harm me; that man in yellow clothes has the colorful papers and "doesn't care about death." Ah, I'm curious, curious why these colorful papers, and those crowded people around, why I feel strange things that they don't feel strange at all? They're the same kind! I still don't understand whether life and colorful pieces of paper are more valuable?

### Manager Zhang's Melancholy

— Ya Yue

Manager Zhang, who usually only reads business news and movie advertisements in the newspaper, has been paying attention to big headlines these days. When he sees people, he will also say something like: "Hey! The US and Japan are about to go to war!" or "The concessions are a bit unreliable!" After that, he sighs a few times.

Really, if the US and Japan really go to war and the concessions are unreliable, then Manager Zhang's assets will really have big problems. Therefore, Manager Zhang also pays special attention to the "world situation." But the big headlines these days are always the same: either "The US is preparing to actively participate in the war" or the Japanese Foreign Minister says that the US and Japan will inevitably "fight" -- this is simply poking at Manager Zhang's eggs!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(5) The Division Between Love and Lust

He rested his brush on the inkstone and kept wiping it. The thoughts in his mind surged like boiling water. He felt that he had too much to say. He originally only wanted to write a short paragraph, which was really not enough. He had to write at least a six- or seven-page letter. He wanted to tell her about his experience learning opera, as well as the situation at home, and his friendship with the Yuan family uncle and nephew, which should also be written very frankly. In addition, he also wanted to express some enthusiastic sympathy for the other party's unfortunate situation. Finally, he felt that he could add a few words to express his love.

"..." The structure seemed very complete, but when the tip of the brush fell on the paper, a great difficulty arose. He couldn't think of what title to use at the beginning.

He really hated himself for not being a little braver just now, and asking her first. As long as he knew what her name was in school, the title would be easy. Now, if he just bluntly wrote "Madam, your letter is reviewed," or "Miss, your letter is reviewed," it would not only be a bit lacking, but also make the other party laugh when they saw it.

This question consumed two or thirty minutes of thinking. In the end, he decided not to use any title at all, and wrote the first line like this:

"I was born unfortunate. At the young age of two, I was abandoned into the Yuzhen Opera Troupe as a child actor because of my father's death, poverty at home, and an elderly mother. What is even more painful is that the teacher acted as he pleased, ordering me to specialize in female roles, forcing a man to lose his complexion and put on makeup, dressing up as a daughter, which is really extremely shameful! ..."

Writing like this, there is indeed a lot of material. Not to mention six or seven pages, even if you want to write full sixty or seventy pages, it is probably not difficult. But he thought, would Luo Xiangqi be willing to spend so much effort to read his little biography? At the same time, he also felt that instead of rambling on for a long time and not arousing the other party's interest, it would be better to write shorter and more brilliantly.

"This time I came to Tianjin, I gained nothing, but in a predicament, I was able to see your beautiful face, which is something I am privately delighted about ... "

This time, he decided to limit it to three pages at most, but after writing two lines on the first page, he felt that if he continued to write like this, it would definitely be another long article. It was because since he said "privately delighted," of course he had to say the reason for his delight, at least he had to tell her about the tedium of his past life, and he couldn't avoid inserting a passage praising her. Once this was spread out, how could it be contained? Helplessly, he had to tear up the second letter again.

### The Cat and Mouse Analogy

— Wei Si

Random Thoughts on Reading the Newspaper (One)

A newspaper in Chongqing recently published an article entitled "Cats and Mice." Its meaning is to compare those who hoard and speculate in various provinces and regions of China today to cats, and the common people like us to mice. The article also quoted the story of a group of mice resisting a cat, but ultimately failing because they could not tie a bell to the cat's foot, to satirize the difficulty of price control today.

However, after reading this article, I feel that this analogy is inappropriate. -- We know that the failure of a group of mice to resist a cat is because mice are inherently pests, and raising cats to eliminate pests is also the truth! As for tying a bell to a cat's foot, it is inherently beyond the capabilities of mice. Like treacherous merchants and powerful officials who hoard and speculate, although they are cunning and treacherous, they cannot be said to have any special privileges that allow them to devour ordinary people like us at any time and any place. Why should we consider ourselves mice and allow them to devour us? Furthermore: if we consider ourselves mice, then we can only listen to the fat-headed and big-eared flower cats' arrangements. If not, then we must know that the hoarders and speculators among treacherous merchants and powerful officials are definitely not comparable to cats. The so-called price control is also not like the difficulty of tying a bell to a cat's foot, because "it is for the elders to break off a branch; it is not that they cannot do it, but that they do not do it."

Manager Zhang began to feel annoyed and melancholic...

Many people offer him advice: his son advises him to invest in the interior, but he scolds his son for being unfilial, wanting to invest the money that his father has worked so hard to "earn" in water; of course, he does not agree with this opinion.

His wife advises him to buy gold bars and hide them at home. However, Manager Zhang is very timid, fearing that once it is exposed, both his "gold" and his "life" will be lost, resulting in nothing. -- This suggestion was rejected by him.

Relatives advise him... He doesn't agree!

Friends advise him... He doesn't agree!

Manager Zhang is gradually getting thinner, worrying about his property...

### "Qi" (Anger/Frustration)

— Qishui

After being "angered," everyone wants to "vent"; but one should vent properly.

If it's "anger" suffered among one's own people, it's okay to suffer "anger" from "outsiders," but if it's something that absolutely must be "vented"! Then it's something that should rightly be "vented," otherwise one is not a "Chinese son or daughter."

However, demolishing fences, burning haystacks, throwing flowerpots, smashing glass, is not "venting anger," it's "unleashing a torrent," not a good method, and it's hard to guarantee there won't be more "bloodshed" in the future!

For the "championship," for the "championship," for "watching the excitement," over thirty thousand "fans" spent over thirty thousand dollars (perhaps more), and returned "angered," it would be better to look more at the "friends" outside the "arena" who are waiting to be fed, which would be more worthwhile. Of course, both this watching and that watching require buying tickets (rice porridge tickets).

But having said that, if one has suffered enough "anger," what use is "anger" alone?

Don't "be angry," just "remember"! Don't forget to "remember"!

### Why I Filmed "The Great Dictator"

— Original by Charlie Chaplin, Translated and Selected from "Column Magazine"

I believe the most laughable thing in the world is mocking those in high positions. The higher the position of the person you satirize, the greater the chance of success for your comedy. —— Hitler should be the biggest target; in the current world, there is no better object of satire and ridicule than him. —— This is why I am happy to film "The Great Dictator."

Some suggest that my filming of this movie has a propaganda purpose, which is far from the truth. I am not interested in this type of propaganda —— most propaganda contains lessons and is incredibly foolish. The reason I made "The Great Dictator" is because I hate dictators, and I want to make the audience laugh.

If I have any other motive for making this film besides entertaining the audience, I can guarantee it is definitely not propaganda.

I have no connection to politics and no special impressions of political science, but I believe I am a philanthropist, as every artist imagines themselves to be. I don't like to see one person or one system dominating a group of lowly, helpless people.

When I started making "The Great Dictator," I did not expect the film to be shown in Germany. In terms of business, a high-ranking Nazi official informed me of this —— he wrote to Josef Breen of the film industry association.

The Nazi protest was as follows: ——

"Dear Mr. Breen: I saw an article in the newspaper titled "Charlie Chaplin will play Hitler," which stated that Mr. Chaplin will play a cowardly little Jew who is mistaken for a powerful dictator because the other role he plays is the dictator himself."

"The article also states that the Führer played by Chaplin is never discovered by great detectives like Solomon or Sherlock Holmes. Although Hitler's surname is naturally not mentioned in this article, if this news is confirmed, it will cause serious difficulties and disturbances. Please consider this point."

I hope this film can be shown in all totalitarian countries. In fact, I have prepared several copies of this film, available free of charge for any totalitarian country to show. Someone assured me that "The Great Dictator" would be popular with audiences if it were shown in totalitarian countries.

For me, the impact of this film on my own future is secondary. To enhance the value of the plot, I have given other actors, such as Jack Oakie and Miss Paulette Goddard, extremely demanding tasks.

Although most of the characters in "The Great Dictator" are easily recognizable to the audience and can be identified as famous figures in contemporary politics, my intention is not to allude to anyone. I have tried my best to capture the feeling: you, I, and all those who hate dictators, may have the same face as Hitler or Mussolini.

I believe that under the cold exterior of Hitler seen in newsreels, there is actually hidden the nature of a tiny, despicable, and inferior neurotic. Mussolini's personality is completely different from him —— strong, unsettling, conceited, but at heart, a villager.

When making "The Great Dictator," many serious problems did arise. The world market, which was once closely related to my films, has greatly shrunk, and the cost of making this film is extremely high. This sum will be largely recovered from the American audience.

However, I still hope that China, Central America, and South America will ease the ban on showing this film. I feel that if they see the dictator in the same way we do, their interest in dictators will be lessened.

In fact, I am not concerned about whether "The Great Dictator" can make money. First, I must make it a good film —— I must make the audience laugh. If in a world, people cannot laugh at all, then this world is hopeless.

### Random Notes from the Art Scene

— Shouwu

Last night, "Zhonglv" (China Travel Troupe) had Tang Huaiqiu, Tang Ruoqing, Xi Jiabao, and Wu Chengda come forward at the Guangming Cafe to entertain the press for reasons unknown. Awaiting an "official report" for further details. One can guess beforehand that it is related to the repertoire and location of the performance.

The repertoire for "Zhonglv's" revival is tentatively set as "Hong Xuanjiao," written by Wei Ruhui and directed by Fei Mu. However, if time is short, whether it can be performed as scheduled is still a question. As for the performance location, the more likely possibility is the Lyceum Theatre, because the Tianfeng Company has already organized its own "Tianfeng Troupe" at the Swatow Road location. Although manpower is insufficient, the first performance, "Sunrise," is essentially borrowed entirely from the Dongwu Drama Society. But in any case, Tianfeng must perform at least one show, during which "Zhonglv" will not be able to perform at the Swatow Road location again.

"Tianfeng's" first performance being "Sunrise" is quite disappointing to those who care. Viewed in isolation, "Sunrise" is indeed a good play, and among Cao Yu's three plays, "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," and "Wilderness," "Sunrise" has the strongest social significance. However, "Sunrise" has been performed so often and so poorly in Shanghai that if the performance cannot surpass previous performances, its "flavor" will be very bland. Because Tianfeng's performances should be different from some "autumn wind operas," they cannot just randomly gather some so-called movie stars to put on a show, exploitatively perform some "cold plate" plays like "Sunrise," and consider that they have fulfilled their responsibility to the drama movement. Unless the foundation of Tianfeng's organization lies in "stars" and not in "drama."

"World's Children" has decided to start filming as scheduled on the 26th. It is said that the first scene will be an interior shot of a hospital, and the first shot is internally set to be the scene of Zhang Yi, the male lead and production director of the film. Due to the intensity of work, the "Friendship Gathering" originally planned after the completion of "Song of Ancient China" will likely be canceled to concentrate efforts on "World's Children." Or, it will be held after the completion of "World's Children."

Although there is no destiny, there is causality. The transformation of adversity, the weaknesses of adversity, the factors of new things are all natural causes. The stimulus of force accelerates the change of things, which is a man-made cause. The evolution from various causes to a certain situation is reality, whether it is success or failure, these are all effects.

Chapter 3: Making One Remember Lord Pingyuan

At this point, that person had no choice but to say, "Master Li, because I came here and received your hospitality and care, I felt I had no way to repay you. Today, while I was out, I passed a house and saw a famous black horse tied under a green willow tree outside the gate. I knew this horse must have a great origin. Looking over the fence, I saw inside a room, this brawny man with a curly beard and a young man were admiring a treasured saber. There was also a treasured sword, the light of the saber and sword was chilling, making my heart move. I thought to myself that the three things were invaluable and rare, so I decided to steal them at night. If I could steal them and present them to Master Li, it would please him. After all, I have been eating here for a long time, and it wouldn't be a free lunch. Who knew that when I used my flying skills to get there, I saw that there were no swords hanging in the room, probably the owner had hidden them. I was a little disappointed. When I came back out, I saw the black horse tied in the courtyard and wanted to steal it. The people in the house were alarmed and got up to fight me. At first, the young man's skills were very ordinary, but later, this brawny man with a curly beard was highly skilled in martial arts. I couldn't defeat him and was afraid of losing, so I retreated. Unexpectedly, the two of them chased after me relentlessly. I used hidden weapons to injure one of them, but he still chased me here. Now I have alarmed Master Li, and I am extremely ashamed. Since he is unwilling to let me go, I will change my weapons and fight him to the death here. I would like to ask Master Li to be a witness." After saying that, he ran inside, changed to a pair of iron hammers, raised them high in his hands, and said to Zhang Cangqiu, "Come, come, I will fight you for another hundred rounds." Zhang Cangqiu also held up his treasured saber and said, "Very good, if I lose tonight, I will give you the treasured saber and the famous horse." Just as the two were about to start fighting, the young man waved his spear and stopped them, saying, "So that's how it is, you don't need to fight anymore. As the saying goes, 'Without a fight, there is no acquaintance,' and 'When two tigers fight, one must be injured.' You two are both skilled people, so there's no need to fight fiercely. Let me mediate for you." He then said to Zhang Cangqiu, "I am Li Xin, and I have been living in Qixian here. All my life I have loved making friends with heroes from all over the world. This Chen Fei is a strong warrior and a guest in my house. His light body skills are very good, and his martial arts are also excellent. I never thought that tonight, because of stealing a horse and a sword, I would get to know another hero. May I ask, what is your name? Where are you from? From what I see, you are not from this place." (15)

### Liu Tianhong Talks About Opera

Mr. Liu Shuyi (formerly the child actor Liu Tianhong), who abandoned his acting career to go into business (20 years ago), has not spoken of opera since giving up the red carpet. Although friends and relatives have repeatedly asked him to lecture on the principles of opera, he has always declined, saying his voice is hoarse and he doesn't want to talk much. It is now heard that Mr. Liu's voice has gradually recovered, and after repeated invitations from close friends, he could not refuse due to affection and ability. He finally agreed to research together in his spare time. Therefore, Wang Ziping, E Lügong, Wang Shuishui, Xu Jiepu, Gu Weicheng, Ma Zhishan, etc., organized the Wei Ping Opera Society at Wang Ziping's clinic at 16 Beile Road. Every night at 8 o'clock, they gather in the society to discuss dramatic theory, expressions, singing styles, and techniques. When there are difficult points, they ask Mr. Liu to correct them. Mr. Wang Ziping also teaches the members various martial arts every night after the drama discussion is over, so that the members' physique can be improved and strengthened.
