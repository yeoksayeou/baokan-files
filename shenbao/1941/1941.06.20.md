Chongqing – The Sino-British boundary line in the southern section of Yunnan-Burma has been unresolved for a long time. In the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, an incident occurred in which the Burmese side sent personnel to explore the Lufang mining area. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately consulted with the British side and agreed to jointly establish a joint boundary survey committee to conduct on-site surveys in order to seek a fundamental solution. The committee, which included a neutral member appointed by the League of Nations Administrative Council, conducted detailed on-site surveys in the winters of the 24th and 25th years of the Republic of China. All work was completed in April of the 26th year of the Republic of China, and a report was submitted to the Chinese and British governments. Over the years, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been negotiating with the British side in a spirit of harmony, compromise, and efficiency, and a satisfactory resolution has now been reached. The exchange of notes was signed on the 18th. The Ban Hong area, Mengjiao and Mengdong, the western part of Mengka Gongnong Piyong Manhui Townships, and the Yongguang Mengsuo Ximeng areas, which the Chinese side has been contending for over the years, have all been demarcated to the Chinese side, totaling an area of nearly 2,000 square kilometers. As for Lufang, which was originally outside the boundary line stipulated in the old treaty and the yellow line drawn by Le Chen, and which was also ruled by the neutral chairman of the boundary survey committee to belong to the British side, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, considering its close historical relationship with China and as one of the factors proposed by the Burmese side to redraw the boundary line, repeatedly negotiated and finally suggested that the Lufang mineral resources be jointly invested and exploited by China and Britain in the future. After repeated consultations, the British Burmese government agreed to express goodwill. The exchange of notes on this joint exploitation of the Lufang mining area was also signed at the same time.

### Foreign Minister Wang's Note to the British Ambassador

Chongqing, 19th – The original text of the Sino-British exchange of notes on the demarcation of the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma border and the joint exploitation of the Lufang mining area is as follows: Foreign Minister Wang's note to the British Ambassador: I have the honor to refer to the exchange of notes signed by your Excellency's predecessor and the then Minister of this Ministry on April 9, 24th year of the Republic of China, which defines the terms of reference for the boundary survey committee responsible for determining the undefined section of the Yunnan-Burma border, and the exchange of notes signed on the same day containing the understanding on the mining area. The joint boundary survey committee was subsequently formally established and, in accordance with its mandate, submitted a report to both governments. The issue of modifying the treaty line found by the committee during its survey has also been jointly assisted by the Chinese government and the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Burmese government (i.e., the successor to the Indian government) in accordance with the provisions of the additional understanding of April 9, 24th year of the Republic of China. I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the Chinese government agrees to replace the following boundary line for the boundary line described in Sections 3 and 4 of Article 3 of the Supplementary Treaty between China and Britain signed in Beijing on the 3rd day of the first month of the 23rd year of the Guangxu Emperor (February 4, 1897): (The boundary line starts from the location of boundary marker No. 97 of the already determined northern section, the confluence of the Nanpa River and the Nanding River, and goes upstream along the Nanding River for approximately three miles to Hongtan Village in Bangdao, which is a small hill on the left bank of the Nanding River, where the Sino-British committee built stone pile No. 1 between the 25th year of Guangxu (1898) and the 26th year of Guangxu (1900). The boundary line then runs roughly south along this small hill to stone pile No. 2 where the road between Huban and Mengding crosses this small hill, to reach stone pile No. 3 on the summit of Laixing Mountain (1366). The boundary line then follows the watershed of the Nanda River, including the Nalaixia River (also known as the Gongmeng River, a tributary of the Nanda River, which flows into the river through a natural bridge), and the watershed of the Mankah River and the Xiaonangun River (also known as the Lili River basin), to Mount 2360 (approximately at longitude 98 degrees 57 minutes 14 seconds east, latitude 23 degrees 21 minutes 40 seconds north). The boundary line then descends along the nearest tributary of the Nanban River (also known as the Jin River), the source of which is approximately half a mile west of Mount 2303, and follows the Nanzhang River to its confluence with the Danangun River (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 0 minutes 30 seconds east, latitude 23 degrees 14 minutes 48 seconds north). The boundary line then follows the Danangun River downstream to its confluence with a tributary on its left bank (approximately at longitude 98 degrees 73 seconds east, latitude 23 degrees 13 minutes 20 seconds north). The boundary line then ascends this tributary to its source and goes southeast to a mountain ridge and then to Mount 1970 (approximately at longitude 95 degrees 3 minutes 58 seconds east, latitude 23 degrees 10 minutes 42 seconds north). (Then, the boundary line runs south along this mountain range to Mount 1770 (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 3 minutes 27 seconds east, latitude 23 degrees 7 minutes 25 seconds north). The boundary line then runs east along the watershed of the Nangun River and the Nantun River until it meets the watershed approximately one mile south of Mount 2179 (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 10 minutes east, latitude 23 degrees 6 minutes 23 seconds north). The boundary line then runs east along the watershed of the Erjiang River to the south of Mount 2178, and then roughly south through Mount 2196 to reach Mount 1930 (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 34 minutes east, latitude 22 degrees 56 minutes). The boundary line then follows the watershed of the Nanma River basin and the Nankabei River (also known as the Kuli River) and the Nanqigao River basin, first southwest, then west, and finally north to Mount 1523 (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 26 minutes 43 seconds east, latitude 22 degrees 56 minutes 45 seconds north). The boundary line then follows the most prominent tributary of the Nankazhen River downstream and along this river to its confluence with the right tributary at approximately latitude 22 degrees 50 minutes 52 seconds. The boundary line then ascends this tributary west and southwest to its source and crosses the ridge of Mount 12180, which is the highest peak (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 24 minutes 38 seconds east, latitude 22 degrees 48 minutes 37 seconds north), and takes the most direct route to the source of the nearest tributary of the Nansi River, then follows this source downstream to its confluence with the Nanxu River (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 18 minutes 42 seconds east, latitude 22 degrees 44 minutes 18 seconds north). Then, the boundary line descends along the Nanxu River to its confluence with the Nanka River at approximately longitude 99 degrees 23 minutes 20 seconds east, latitude 22 degrees 35 minutes 10 seconds, and then descends along the Nanka River to a boundary marker in the determined southern section. Attached is a map sent by the Boundary Survey Committee. All boundary lines are marked with red lines on the map. I have the honor to request Your Excellency to confirm that the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Burmese Government agree to replace the aforementioned boundary line for the boundary line referred to in Sections 3 and 4 of Article 3 of the Annex to the Sino-British Convention on Burma signed in Beijing on the 3rd day of the first month of the 23rd year of Guangxu (February 4, 1897). I have the honor to request Your Excellency to examine and reply accordingly. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration. To His Excellency Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United Kingdom to the Republic of China. Attached: one map. Wang Chonghui, June 18, 30th year of the Republic of China.

### Japanese Face Difficulties Whether Advancing South or Attacking Inland China

Tokyo – Meetings May Raise Discussions: Hua Army Spokesman Declares to the Press

Chongqing – The Hua army spokesman declared when hosting reporters from various newspapers this afternoon that the meeting currently being held by the Japanese authorities in Tokyo is probably debating whether Japan should advance into the South Pacific or attack inland China. Japan will face serious difficulties in both of the above actions. The spokesman said that the Japanese army used a total of eight divisions in the recent battle of Zhongtiao Mountain in southern Shanxi, which foreshadows the difficulties of the Japanese army in attacking inland China, because there are dozens of such mountain ranges in the inland. The spokesman also called attention to the fact that more than 100 Japanese warships are now concentrated near the coast of Zhejiang, and their intentions are still difficult to determine. The spokesman finally stated that in the past week, there have only been reports of small-scale military operations on the various Sino-Japanese fronts. Japanese troops in southern Hubei Province have attacked Hua army positions near the border between Hunan and Hubei, but all Japanese offensives have been repelled as of yesterday, and the Hua army is still holding its original positions.

Editorial

### The Solution to the Sino-Burmese Border Issue

According to a Chongqing dispatch from the day before yesterday: The Sino-British exchange of notes on the demarcation of the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma Road was signed in the wartime capital on the afternoon of the 18th, detailing the boundary line between Yunnan Province and the Burmese border. This historical issue, which has been pending for more than fifty years, has been rationally resolved after numerous twists and turns in an atmosphere of unprecedented Sino-British friendship. In addition to being worth celebrating, it should also be considered a valuable diplomatic achievement for both China and Britain in the war. Now, let us take a retrospective look at the past history.

The relationship between the Yunnan-Burma border area and China began with Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty's communication with the southwestern barbarians. Its formal belonging to the Chinese territory began in the era of Kublai Khan of the Mongol Empire. The Jinchi Burma Kingdom, Pagan, and Babai Xifu states, which were established in that area, were either conquered by the Mongol army or sent envoys to pay tribute one after another. Throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties, Yunnan was divided into a province, and Burma also paid tribute continuously. In the old Sino-Burmese boundary, which was established before the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, it spanned both inside and outside the Jinsha River, and the ten offices of Mengyang, Menggong, and Mengmi were all within Chinese territory. Later, a new boundary was re-delineated, but because Burma was a Chinese vassal state, many undefined boundaries were not strictly demarcated. In 1886, Britain annexed Burma, and the border negotiation began to form a problem. At that time, the Qing court ordered Prince Qing Yikuang, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to consult with the British Minister O'Conor on Sino-Burmese relations, and five articles were established, the third of which was: "The Sino-Burmese border shall be jointly surveyed and demarcated by China and Britain." However, in reality, the Qing court delayed and procrastinated, and it was not until 1894 that it sent the British envoy Xue Fucheng to negotiate border affairs with Britain, and 20 articles of demarcation and trade were drawn up, stipulating that the determined boundary would be from Jian Gao Mountain at 25 degrees 35 minutes north latitude to the Mekong River bank at 21 degrees 27 minutes north latitude, but among them, from the confluence of the Nanding River Nanbang River at 23 degrees 30 minutes north latitude to the confluence of the Nanma River and Nanchang River near Mengma, only the principles of the boundary line were determined, and its specific demarcation had to be the same as the undetermined boundary from 25 degrees 30 minutes north latitude to the north to Gongshan Administration Bureau. It also has yet to be investigated on the ground, which is also the so-called difference between the southern undefined boundary and the northern undefined boundary. The northern section includes Jiangxinpo and Pianma, and the southern section includes Ban Hong, all of which are familiar disputed areas. However, during the actual survey in 1899, the maps used by both sides differed (that is, the so-called yellow line and red line, and later the so-called green line and blue line, etc., were all proposals regarding the boundary line), and the British side mistakenly pointed to Kongming Mountain as the Gongming Mountain stipulated in the boundary, resulting in large differences in the views of both sides, and no decision could be reached. It has been shelved to this day for more than 40 years.

In those 40 years, because the border was uncertain, disputes occurred between the two sides from time to time. There have been several disturbances in the Jiangxinpo Pianma area since 1910. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Shuangli also caused major disputes due to the mineral resources near Ban Hong. In view of the fact that the border has been in turmoil for a long time, it is impossible to prevent all kinds of disputes. China and Britain consulted and established a joint survey committee to re-survey the old border. Each of China and Britain sent two members, and the Administrative Council of the League of Nations sent a neutral member to form the committee, which was announced on April 17 of the 24th year of the Republic of China. After the establishment of the committee, it went to the Sino-Burmese border to conduct on-site surveys for two consecutive sessions, and after several negotiations, it finally produced a report in April of the 26th year of the Republic of China; however, due to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War shortly after, there was no time to originally determine the border based on the survey results. This long-pending issue was finally resolved the day before yesterday. The focal points of past disputes between the two sides, such as Ban Hong and Mengdong, were definitively demarcated to the Chinese side, while the issue of the Lufang mining area near Ban Hong was decided to be jointly invested and exploited by China and Britain.

The solution to this historical dispute is naturally an important milestone in China's struggle to improve its international status, and it should also be seen as the beginning of the current British and American authorities' preparation to abolish unequal treaties with China after the war. This should certainly be attributed to the efforts and wisdom of the diplomatic authorities of both China and Britain. On the other hand, it is not because China has strived to resist construction and has been valued by the powers of the world. As long as we continue to strive unremittingly, it is expected that China's diplomatic gains in the future will be a hundred times more than the solution to the Yunnan-Burma border.

The undetermined border between Yunnan and Burma originally had two sections, north and south, but the committee organized in the 24th year of the Republic of China to conduct surveys was limited to the southern section. Although the Chongqing telegram did not clearly point out the longitude, latitude, and four extremes of this demarcation and exchange of notes, a detailed analysis of the meaning of the text probably limited it to the southern section, while the northern section is still an issue to be decided. For the sake of border security and the preservation of good Sino-British and Sino-Burmese friendship, now that the southern boundary line has been determined, the northern section should not be allowed to remain undecided for a long time, although for the sake of Sino-Burmese transportation construction, perhaps the southern section is more important than the northern section. Based on the same spirit and position, I believe that the demarcation of the northern section of the Yunnan-Burma border will not be difficult to obtain the same fair and reasonable solution as the southern border.

### America Rejects German Protest, Limits German Consul's Exit, Unknown What Means Germany Will Adopt, It Is Generally Expected That There Will Be No Break With America Currently

Reuters, Washington, 19th - Welles of the State Department told reporters yesterday that he would not release the content of the dispatch sent by the German chargé d'affaires in the United States regarding the closure of German offices in the United States, only that the US authorities were now arranging for the German consul to leave the country. This statement is tantamount to saying that the United States will reject the German protest. Welles said that in accordance with the usual procedures, the United States will ask other warring countries to issue safe conducts for these consuls, and the United States is now trying to arrange for them to return directly to Germany without going to South America. What the German side protested against was the expulsion of the German consul, not the freezing order. Welles also said that the survivors of the American cargo ship Robin Moor had taken excellent photos to confirm that the oral confession of the attacker was a German submarine. It is heard that the German dispatch pointed out that the expulsion of the German consul destroyed the German-American Consular Treaty of 1923, simply temporarily canceling it without giving a year's notice of repeal.

Associated Press, Washington, 19th - A high-ranking government official told the Associated Press that although Germany had protested, German consular officials in the United States would still be expelled. This statement was actually a rumor that the British government would reject the German protest. The official also said that the United States has the right to weigh and decide whether a foreign consular official should be allowed to perform his duties, and that Germany had previously asked the United States to withdraw its consular officials stationed in the Netherlands, Austria, and other countries, and the United States had to comply.

Italian Newspapers Still Attack America

Associated Press, Rome, 19th - Under the authorization of the authorities, newspapers here are still unanimously publishing anti-American commentaries, denouncing President Roosevelt's recent order to freeze Axis funds in the United States, in order to provoke the Axis to go to war and thereby avoid the responsibility of involving the United States in the war. Most newspapers said that Rome and Berlin have decided to use appropriate retaliation and avoid increasing the tension between the Axis and the United States. The newspapers also pointed out that Italy's deposits in the United States are only 63 million US dollars, while the property awarded in the United States is 145 million US dollars, so the loss suffered by the United States after freezing Axis funds is even greater than that of Italy.

America Asks Thailand to Pay Off Purchase of Aircraft

Associated Press, Bangkok, 19th - American Minister to Thailand Landon told the Associated Press today that the United States has requested the Thai government to pay off the funds for the aircraft it has ordered, and that the US State Department has sent a dispatch to Gessler, stating that the United States has cooperated with Britain to transport mineral oil to Thailand.

### Over a Thousand Chinese and American Celebrities Hold a Grand Banquet; Mrs. Bodde, Recently Returned to America from China, Lavishly Praises the Greatness of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and His Wife

United Press, New York, 19th – A total of 1,500 officials, financiers, cultural figures, and business leaders from China and the United States gathered last night at a grand banquet hosted by the United China Relief Fund at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where they all lauded Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, and strongly supported the movement to aid China. Willkie, a Republican leader in America, presided over the banquet. When Mr. Willkie introduced Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih, Chinese writer Dr. Lin Yutang, Dr. Hornbeck of the State Department, Mrs. Luce Bodde, Mrs. Buck, Mr. Kent, opera and film star Ms. Er, and Mr. Smith, the Democratic presidential candidate in the 1928 election, the audience greeted them with cheers. Mrs. Bodde, a famous writer and playwright, had recently returned from a trip to China with her husband, Mr. Luce, and gave a radio address, praising the morale and endurance of the Chinese army, refugees, and civilians. She also lauded the Christians in China for their faith in God and their courageous spirit of upholding righteousness, helping to protect Chinese women and children. When Mrs. Bodde spoke of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, she said that Generalissimo Chiang and Madame Chiang were known throughout the world as one of the greatest couples, and that in her opinion, they were second only to the Roosevelts of the United States. Generalissimo Chiang and his wife are now dividing the work of national affairs, managing military and political affairs, while Madame Chiang is dedicated to moral and social causes. I admire Generalissimo Chiang and his wife, and I admire the Chinese people. Generalissimo Chiang and his wife and their people now share the same determination to strive for freedom at any cost, and to continue the war until what the Japanese call the "China Incident," a ridiculous term, becomes the "Withdrawal from China Incident."

### Although Negotiations Between Japan and the Netherlands Have Broken Down, Japan's Advance Southward Is Still Pending; Batavia's Strong Stance Places Japan in a Dilemma

Reuters, Washington, 19th – Yoshizawa, the Japanese chief representative in the economic negotiations with the Dutch East Indies, recently stated that if the Dutch East Indies did not accept Japan's demands, they would suffer dire consequences. Now the Dutch East Indies have rejected Japan's demands, and Japan has tolerated this. Thus, the view held here that Tokyo is only waging a war of nerves, using Yoshizawa's empty threats to intimidate, has been confirmed. Those familiar with Far Eastern affairs have always felt that although the future is unknowable, at present, Japan is not yet ready to launch any military action south of Vietnam. It is generally speculated that Japan is unable to cope with serious resistance, so the southward advance may not be realized, unless Britain encounters a very significant setback, and the Axis powers can seize the final victory. The content of Japan's demands has not yet been disclosed, but it can be asserted that Japan wants to extend its economic influence in the Dutch East Indies, transplant Japanese people in large numbers, and obtain concessions to develop the natural resources of the Dutch East Indies. If the Dutch East Indies agreed to this kind of demand, then the Dutch East Indies would no longer be a Dutch colony, but a Japanese colony. It is truly puzzling how Japan could hope that the Dutch East Indies would accept such broad demands. People here compare Yoshizawa's threatening remarks of June 6 with his mild tone of yesterday and come to the conclusion that Japan is not yet ready to carry out aggressive actions overseas. Or perhaps Japan is not yet prepared, or rather, is not yet able.

United Press, Manila, 19th – The "Manila Bulletin," published by Americans, stated in an editorial today that the Dutch East Indies' rejection of Japan's economic demands represents a failure of the diplomatic situation in Japan's southward offensive. The newspaper said that Japan's hesitation is due to Britain's continued resistance to the Axis powers and the firm attitude shown by the United States. The newspaper stated that Batavia's tough stance has placed Japan in a dilemma.

TASS, Tokyo, 19th – According to a Domei News Agency correspondent in Batavia, Yoshizawa disclosed the contents of the Japanese government's instructions during his final meeting with the Dutch East Indies authorities, and presented Japan's final demands. Yoshizawa said that since the Dutch East Indies had rejected Japan's demands, there was no need to continue negotiations. The Japanese representative is scheduled to leave Batavia on the 27th. Yoshizawa now intends to meet with the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, and then jointly issue a communiqué stating that the negotiations have been terminated.

### Japanese Newspaper Advocates Concluding an Alliance with Thailand

United Press, Tokyo, 19th – The Kokumin Shimbun recently stated that the Japanese government should take the conclusion of a military alliance with Thailand as the first step in expanding the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The newspaper said that the fate of Thailand and the security of Vietnam, and the security of the entire South China region and its nearby water sources, are all seriously affected. The newspaper further pointed out that China is carrying out economic oppression against Thailand, and its concentration of troops in Burma and south of Malaya is also intended to threaten Thailand into submission, and to eliminate this small enemy at the back door of Singapore. It also said that before Thailand is further oppressed and subdued, Japan should conclude a military alliance with Thailand. This would not only maintain Thailand's security, but also increase the security of the entire East Asia. The Hochi Shimbun quoted the remarks of Japanese parliamentarian Imai, who spoke at a Taisei Yokusankai meeting on Monday, based on a strong southern policy of the Tripartite Pact, to establish his proposed Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The newspaper also said that Imai stated that the failure of the Dutch East Indies negotiations was due to the Japanese government's lack of decisiveness, which led the Dutch East Indies to dare to despise Japan.

Conservative Member of Parliament Knox asked whether the authorities knew that Mellor was fighting for British interests single-handedly in the Far East, and whether the Foreign Secretary would provide assistance to the extent possible. Eden replied, "I will convey to him your appreciation for his work, with the utmost enthusiasm."

### The Situation in the Near East Changes Suddenly; Germany and Turkey Sign a Treaty of Friendship, Guaranteeing Mutual Respect for Territorial Integrity, Which Will Remain in Effect for Ten Years

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 19th – Official sources here stated that the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship was signed on the evening of the 18th by the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, on behalf of the German government, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Saraçoğlu, on behalf of the Turkish government. The full text is as follows:

Germany and Turkey, wishing to place their relations on a basis of mutual trust and sincere friendship, have agreed to sign this treaty, under the condition of maintaining all existing treaties of both countries. The German Head of State has appointed the Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, as plenipotentiary, and the Turkish President has appointed the Foreign Minister, Saraçoğlu, as plenipotentiary, to agree on the following terms:

Article 1: Germany and Turkey guarantee mutual respect for territorial integrity and inviolability, and will not take any direct or indirect measures against each other.

Article 2: Germany and Turkey guarantee that they will conduct friendly consultations in the future regarding issues involving common interests, in order to seek understanding on how to handle these issues.

Article 3: This treaty will be ratified and the instruments of ratification will be exchanged immediately in Berlin. This treaty shall take effect from the date of signing and shall remain in effect for ten years. The contracting parties will, within the stipulated period, reach an understanding on the issue of extending the validity of this treaty. This treaty is written in duplicate in both German and Turkish, and signed in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, on June 18, 1941.

When Papen and Saraçoğlu signed the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship, they exchanged notes on the economic relations between the two countries. The original text is as follows: "Based on the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship signed today, I hereby notify Your Excellency that my government is prepared to increase the economic relations between Germany and Turkey to the maximum possible extent, and to consider the various possibilities of the economic structures of both countries, utilizing the experience gained by both countries during the war. The two governments will immediately begin negotiations to find the basis for implementing this agreed-upon treaty as soon as possible." After the treaty was signed, a joint statement was issued to the newspapers and radio stations, stating that after the plenipotentiaries of the two countries signed the Treaty of Friendship, they hoped that the texts and opinions published by the newspapers and radio stations of both countries would reflect the spirit of friendship and mutual trust in German-Turkish relations.

Interview with the Turkish Foreign Minister

Reuters, Berlin, 19th – The official German news agency reported that the German Ambassador to Turkey and the Turkish Foreign Minister signed the Turkish-German Treaty of Friendship at 9 p.m. last night in Turkey. Shortly afterwards, the Turkish radio station officially announced that Turkey and Germany had signed a non-aggression treaty and exchanged identical documents. At 11 p.m., the radio station suddenly stopped its normal broadcasting program and announced the contents of the Turkish-German treaty and the Turkish Foreign Minister's remarks to the press. The Foreign Minister stated, "The actual and existing obligations of both countries are not affected. Turkey and Germany have now confirmed that they will not oppose each other in any way in the future. Over the centuries, the world has changed, but Turkey and Germany have never opposed each other. Their relationship has always been clear and correct. The signing of this treaty has laid a very solid foundation for friendship." When the Turkish Foreign Minister announced the signing of this treaty, he expressed "great joy," saying that "Mr. von Papen, a friend who is familiar with our country's situation, has made special efforts to ensure that this agreement can be signed."

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 19th – Political circles here believe that the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship is a natural result of the restoration of economic relations between the two countries and the repeated exchanges of notes between Hitler and the Turkish President. Political circles are very satisfied with this treaty, considering it a continuation of the traditional friendship between the two countries during World War I. However, this Treaty of Friendship does not affect the treaties concluded by Turkey with other countries. As for Germany, obtaining the friendship of Turkey is a major diplomatic victory. This also shows the far-sightedness of Turkish politicians. British people in Turkey are quite disappointed with the development of the situation.

Reuters, Ankara, 19th – According to news today, Turkey has refused to sign the Turkish-German Goodwill Agreement unless it includes clauses guaranteeing the British-Turkish treaty. Turkey's loyalty to its treaty obligations with Britain has delayed the negotiations conducted by the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, for a long time. The Turkish Foreign Minister would only sign it after the guarantee clauses were recognized.

Reuters, London, 19th – According to news received here today, the martial law order in Istanbul and coastal areas will continue for six months. Another message said that after Germany and Turkey signed an agreement, the section of the railway in Greece bordering Turkey would be managed by Turkey.

German Foreign Ministry Commentary

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 19th – Regarding the signing of the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship, a German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said last night that the friendship between Germany and Turkey should be traced back to the time of the World War. The depth of the friendship should not be affected by temporary misunderstandings. Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, advocated economic cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, when he was in power, Germany ranked first in both exports and imports to Turkey. German purchases of Turkish raw materials and agricultural products accounted for a very large percentage. The current President İsmet İnönü continues the spirit of his predecessor, establishing this treaty to further consolidate the friendship between the two countries. Germany recognizes Turkey as a stabilizing force in Southeast and the Near East, and Turkey is deeply convinced that Germany has no territorial ambitions in Turkey and the Near East. Hitler's speech on May 5 praised Turkey's peace policy, opposed British conspiracies, and since he came to power, he has worked to strengthen relations with Turkey. The Italian Prime Minister's speech on June 10 also expressed Italy's willingness to continue cooperation with Turkey on the basis of the 1928 Turkish-Italian agreement. Germany will never forget Turkey's old friendship. Germany will provide assistance when Turkey is in danger.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 19th – A semi-official German publication, the German Foreign Policy Correspondence, which only occasionally publishes comments on major political events, commented today on the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship. It first reviewed the close relationship between the two countries in the past, and how Germany became Turkey's largest customer after the National Socialist Party came to power. Later, it described the recent developments, stating that Turkey had signed an agreement with Britain before the outbreak of the war, which naturally had a considerable impact on German-Turkish relations, but since Germany's military superiority increased daily, this influence disappeared. Therefore, the Ankara authorities understood Germany's invincibility and the need for Turkey to adopt a realistic policy. After Germany was forced to intervene in Britain's strategy of expanding the war in the Balkans, Turkey also deeply understood Germany's difficulties. Therefore, the attitude expressed by Turkey when British Foreign Secretary Eden and British military generals repeatedly visited Turkey was also extremely appropriate. The speed of the German army's victory in Greece was also commonly seen by Turkish soldiers. In the political sphere, Turkey found that Germany's previous promises had been fulfilled, thus laying the foundation for Turkey's future policy. This Treaty of Friendship is the external manifestation of that policy. Germany is satisfied with the intelligence relationship stipulated in the treaty.

### British House of Commons to Hold Secret Meeting

Reuters, London, 19th – The House of Commons will soon hold a secret meeting to debate the shipping situation and the war in the Atlantic. When Prime Minister Churchill officially announced this matter today, he said that the debate on shipping should only be held in secret, because if it is discussed in public, the public interest will be seriously endangered. If the debate is held in secret, he will make a statement to the House of Commons, but it will not be made public. Labor Party Member of Parliament Shinwell and former Secretary of War Belisha both advocated for a public debate, but the Prime Minister replied that he could not.

### Suicide Rumors of Field Marshal List Have Been Denied by Berlin

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 19th – Authoritative sources said that foreign newspapers are rumored that Field Marshal List, commander-in-chief of the German forces in the Balkans, has committed suicide due to the failure of the German forces in Crete. This is completely unfounded. List only commands the Balkan war. German Head of State Hitler invited him to lunch together on the 16th and praised his contributions. The commander of the Battle of Crete was German Air Force General Löhr.

### German Troops Deploying in Finland; Britain Intercepts Three Finnish Ships; Announces Finland is Not a Genuinely Independent Country; Stops Issuing Permits for Ships Sailing to Finland

Reuters, London, 19th – German troops arrived in Finland in early June in considerable numbers and deployed within Finnish territory, not merely passing through. After learning that the Finnish government had allowed German troops to pass through Finland to Norway last autumn, the British Ministry of Economic Warfare announced yesterday that it had stopped issuing naval permits for ships sailing to Finland from June 14. Since that date, three Finnish ships have been intercepted, as the British government no longer believes that the Finnish government can comply with the conditions agreed upon last year when Finnish ships had naval permits.

United Press, London, 19th – The Ministry of Economic Warfare announced that British troops had intercepted and detained three Finnish ships heading to Petsamo (a Finnish port on the Arctic Ocean) because Britain could no longer recognize Finland as a genuinely independent country.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 19th – Swedish Defense Minister Sköld stated in Parliament yesterday that Sweden's anti-aircraft artillery was quite weak at the outbreak of this European war, but it has now been greatly strengthened. Those who were previously prevented from enlisting will be called up for training this winter. Forty-six percent of those qualified to join the Air Force have already enlisted.

United Press, Capital of Sweden, 19th – Finnish newspapers yesterday heard rumors from the Finnish capital that Soviet troops were withdrawing from Hanko and other Soviet bases in Finnish territory. However, this news has not yet been confirmed. According to previous news, it was reported that after strong German forces arrived in Finland, the Soviet troops would destroy the communication lines in Karelia.

Rumors of German-Romanian Attack on the Soviet Union Not Credited by Britain and America

United Press, New York, 19th – Ankara Columbia Broadcasting System correspondent Burt said yesterday that many unfounded reports have been received from commercial broadcasting companies in Turkey, stating that Romania has issued an ultimatum to the Soviet Union to return Bessarabia, and that German troops have attacked the Soviet Union at fifteen points along the Romanian border. However, Burt said that according to what is known in Turkey, this news is not true.

Reuters, Manila, 19th – Unconfirmed telegrams have been received here stating, according to Turkish newspapers, that German troops have launched a fifteen-pronged attack on the Soviet Union along the eastern border, and that Romania has also issued an ultimatum to the Soviet Union demanding the return of Bessarabia.

United Press, London, 19th – Reliable British sources said yesterday that London had no confirmed news regarding Romania or Germany taking military action against the Soviet Union, or sending an ultimatum. It was also said that such news has been circulating since Tuesday. Most of these rumors are unfounded and originated from Ankara and Istanbul. It was also said that since these rumors have continued to circulate in the past seventeen hours and have still not been confirmed, they should absolutely not be taken seriously.

United Press, Washington, 19th – The State Department said last night that it had heard nothing about rumors that German troops had attacked the Soviet Union.

Havas News Agency, Swiss Capital, 18th – There are many rumors circulating about German-Soviet relations. Today it was also rumored that a group of senior Soviet military officers will soon visit Berlin, but according to a Berlin correspondent for the "Basler Nachrichten," German officials have heard nothing about this.

### Tank Battles in the Western Desert Triangle End; Communiqué States that the Objective Has Been Achieved; British Forces Withdraw to Forward Positions

Reuters, Cairo, 19th – The fierce three-day battle in the triangle between the Solum, Capuzzo, and Halfaya Pass in the Western Desert has come to an end. The communiqué stated that the British forces repelled several attacks by enemy forces. As a large enemy force attempted to encircle the British forward troops, the British forces withdrew to forward positions, but had achieved the objective of forcing the enemy to reveal its strength and inflicting heavy damage on it. Several hundred German soldiers were captured, and many enemy tanks and artillery were destroyed.

Reuters, Cairo, 19th – It is reported that there were still fierce tank battles yesterday in the triangle east of Halfaya Pass. Military circles in Cairo said that this was a local battle.

Havas News Agency, Washington, 18th – According to news from both Italian sides, the British forces operating in North Africa have used light tanks shipped by the U.S. Army Department to Britain. These light tanks weigh 13 tons, have a speed of 40 miles per hour, are equipped with a light cannon, several machine guns, and have thick steel plates that cannot be penetrated by machine gun bullets. The United States produces 300 of these tanks per month.

United Press, Rome, 19th – The Italian news agency reported that in the Battle of Solum, the British forces used hundreds of the latest American tanks. At the same time, Gayda said in his newspaper that the British forces used a total of two tank divisions, with a thousand tanks, and that 200 were destroyed.

### Turkey Still Maintains the Spirit of Friendship with England; Foreign Envoys in London Believe German-Turkish Agreement is a Major Blow to the Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 19th – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent states that since Yugoslavia and Greece have successively been ravaged by Nazi troops, Turkey is under even greater pressure from Germany to join the Axis powers. Not only is Turkey endangered by the German occupation of Aegean islands, making it vulnerable to German attack on its weakest defensive line, but also its closest neighboring countries are, due to circumstances, unable to provide Turkey with any assistance. Turkey's source of war materials relied on France, and since France's defeat, Turkey has been greatly affected. Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that Turkey has to reach a compromise with Germany within limited bounds. Germany originally wanted to force Turkey to abolish its treaty obligations to England or to allow German troops to pass through Turkish territory, but Turkey maintained its sovereignty and remained steadfast. This is especially noteworthy. Turkey not only maintains its current status of non-involvement in the war but also, in maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity, expresses loyalty to the goodwill and spirit of friendship contained in the Anglo-Turkish alliance. The new German-Turkish treaty explicitly preserves Turkey's existing obligations, so it can be concluded that although Germany is trying to promote the importance of this treaty as part of a psychological war against the Soviet Union, this treaty will not destroy Turkey's friendship with England, nor will it cause Turkey to take actions that harm England. When these negotiations were underway, the British authorities were kept fully informed.

Eden's Position Unshaken

United Press, London, 10th – Foreign embassies and responsible British figures, after yesterday's study, believe the sudden German-Turkish friendship treaty is a major blow to the Soviet Union. London observers attach great importance to the tense situation between Germany and the Soviet Union. Some speculate that Hitler's delay in making formal demands on the Soviet Union is to wait until Turkey is brought to heel, weakening the friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey. However, many British commentators insist that the new Turkish-German agreement still leaves the Anglo-Turkish alliance fully in effect, and Ankara may issue another statement confirming this. Foreign embassy officials believe that the German-Turkish agreement represents Germany gradually gaining British influence in Turkey and replacing it, effectively representing a new military situation in the eastern Mediterranean. Germany has already destroyed the Balkans and Crete and now prevents the British navy from gaining a foothold on the Turkish coast, but it is also believed that Turkey has not allowed German troops and war materials to pass through its territory. However, Germany will inevitably continue to increase its power in Turkey in the future. The impact of this treaty on Iran is also more favorable to Germany. This news has not yet been released in London last night. The agreement will not shake the position of Foreign Secretary Eden. Officials still firmly state that the ambassador to the Soviet Union, Cripps, will still return to Moscow unless Germany and the Soviet Union go to war. Even if war breaks out, if the Soviet Union expresses willingness to negotiate terms with Britain, Cripps can still return to his post.

### Random Notes on the European War (VI)(4): The European War and American Public Opinion

Will the United States participate in the European War? This is a major question of concern to people around the world. The following is a detailed record from the New York Times:

For more than sixteen months, the American Gallup and Princeton opinion polling organizations have continuously measured the impact of the European War on American public opinion and explored the reasons for its evolution over time.

The latest conclusions of the surveys are: (1) Although those who advocate that the United States should declare war on Germany and Italy are in the minority, the vast majority advocate that if there is no other way to defeat the "Axis powers," then the United States should participate in the war; (2) Support for intensifying aid to Britain is growing, and in order to make the aid to Britain policy effective, the majority also advocate implementing convoys, that is, sending warships to protect merchant ships transporting military supplies to Britain.

Based on the above conclusions, although the opinions of various parties seem to contradict each other, they are not. A large part of Americans insist that Germany must be defeated, and if Britain cannot shoulder the arduous task alone, the United States should join the war. This raises a question of fact: If the United States does not participate in the war, can Britain win?

When Americans are directly asked whether they should go to war with Germany and Italy, only 10% give an affirmative answer. However, opinion polls vary depending on the content of the question. When they are asked about general aid to Britain, 77% advocate intensifying aid to Britain, and 62% believe that risking war to aid Britain is more important than avoiding involvement in the war. According to a report released by Gallup in early May, two-thirds of the nation believe that Colonel Lindbergh's views on the war are very different from their own, which can be seen as clear evidence.

Regarding the convoy issue, according to Gallup's recent report, 40% of the national total supports convoys, and 71% believe that saving Britain from defeat cannot be achieved without convoys. As for those who accept the survey, 72% support convoys.

Last spring, when the real war had not yet broken out, Americans believed that Britain and France did not need American assistance and could win. Then, the British and French allied forces were successively defeated in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, and the general public believed that Britain's chances of winning were slim, and the United States did not need to risk war. However, after Britain announced its continued war, the argument for supporting Britain at all costs rose again.

In early April this year, more than three-quarters of Americans believed that Britain could win, 5% believed that Germany could win, and the rest were ambiguous. After the British navy defeated the Italian fleet in the Mediterranean and a coup occurred in Yugoslavia, American optimism reached its peak. By early May, when Athens fell, the number of Americans who believed that Britain could still win dropped to 52%, the number who predicted Germany would win was 18%, those with undecided opinions accounted for 22%, and those who expected the war situation to be chaotic accounted for 8%.

However, during this period, the public did not have much disagreement with the government's policies. The number who believed that risking war to aid Britain was better than staying out of it decreased from 70% to 62%. The number who advocated going to war with Germany increased slightly, and the number who supported convoys was even greater than before. After Britain's defeat in the Balkans, the number of supporters of isolation increased by 8%, but at the same time, there was an equal increase in the number who advocated aiding Britain at all costs.

Americans' answers to specific questions, especially those involving complex and important events such as war, are often prone to misunderstanding. Those who insist that the United States should not be involved in the war can cite the results of opinion polls to say that only 10% of the country supports participating in the war. Those who advocate that the United States should risk war to aid Britain can also confidently say that the results of opinion polls are in their favor.

If we carefully analyze American public opinion, we can find that Americans are generally divided into the following five factions:

(1) The majority of the people believe that Britain cannot win without the United States, and the United States should help it at the cost of war, and they believe that if Germany wins, it will definitely attack the United States within ten years, control American commerce and foreign markets, deprive Americans of their freedom, and force the United States to maintain a strong national defense and spend huge national defense expenditures, plunging the people into poverty.

(2) About 15% of the people believe that Britain cannot win without American assistance, and the United States should help it at the cost of war, but they do not believe that Germany's victory will lead to the above-mentioned terrible consequences. Some of them are shocked by Germany's aggressive actions, some are pro-British, and some are simply irreconcilable with the aggressor.

(3) About 20% of the people believe that the United States should avoid involvement in the war, even if Germany wins and then attacks the United States, controls its trade, deprives it of its freedom, and reduces its standard of living, they will not change their mind. Some of them believe that Britain does not need American assistance and can win, and the United States has no reason to risk war further. Others believe that admitting Germany's victory is better than the United States getting involved in the war.

(4) Another 15% believe that the United States should avoid involvement in the war and believe that even if Germany wins, the United States will not be attacked, its foreign trade will not be hindered, and its general life will be as comfortable as usual. They will only support war when the United States is truly invaded or has been invaded.

(5) Another 3% to 10% do not have much opinion, and they do not know what their views on the war are. Most of them are not interested in the war.

In short, those who strongly advocate participating in the war are mostly middle or upper-class graduates of universities in the South, who are over 30 years old. Strict isolationists are mostly young women in the Midwest who have not received a university education, or men over the age of 50 who have low incomes and have not received a full education.

### British Mechanized Forces Are Expanding

United Press, London, 19th – The leader of the British House of Lords, Lord Moyne, in replying to Lord Gort's comments on the Battle of Crete, revealed for the first time that Britain has begun to expand its mechanized divisions in a manner similar to Germany's. He said that the Germans had highly effective radio cooperation from the beginning of the war and that he believed that Britain's armored forces are now being organized in a way that closely cooperates with the air force, similar to the Germans. This function will definitely support the war of mechanized troops.

### British Submarines Active in the Central Mediterranean, Sinking Several German and Italian Supply Ships; Alexandria Was Bombed Again the Day Before Yesterday

Reuters, London, 19th – A Navy Department communiqué states that British submarines operating in the Aegean Sea report having fired torpedoes and sunk the Italian oil tanker Garaltia (3,329 tons) and three German flat-bottomed boats and one Italian ship. The three flat-bottomed boats were sailing to German-occupied islands in the Aegean Sea, one carrying personnel and supplies, another carrying oil, and the Italian ship carrying troops, munitions, and supplies, when they were sunk en route to another island in the Aegean Sea.

### Youth Association College Guidance Lecture Series - Day Four (1)

Yesterday marked the final day of the Youth Association's college guidance lectures. Students from Aurora University and three other schools provided introductions to their respective institutions, as follows:

Aurora University Overview

First, Aurora University student Wang Juerong introduced the general situation of the university. He mentioned that the school was founded in 1903 and has been in existence for thirty-eight years. Because it is sponsored by the Catholic Church, it possesses a unique school spirit. Most professors are priests who do not seek remuneration for teaching, their lives being maintained by the church. Therefore, their work efficiency is not affected by rising living costs. Furthermore, the school buildings are excellent, and student life is very comfortable. The dormitories, such as those for female students, have sanitary facilities in every room, which is a notable example. In addition, priests teach in French, so students' French proficiency is very high. In the past, when a certain national bank wanted to establish branches in Haiphong and Hanoi, graduates from the school, regardless of their major, were almost all hired immediately. However, the most painful thing for students is the exams, which are held once a week, from morning until night. Oral exams are especially difficult. A priest asks questions individually, and if the student cannot answer, there is silence for fifteen minutes before they can leave. At this time, the priest says "Thank you," which is extremely embarrassing. The restrictions for oral exams in major exams are even stricter to prevent favoritism due to personal feelings between teachers and students. Students call it the "Three-Court Joint Trial." In addition, if students are sick, they can be treated at the school's hospital, with medical expenses calculated at half price. Therefore, there are many people who take the Aurora University exam because they have some hidden ailment. As for the organizational structure, there are four colleges: Law, Engineering, Medicine, and Liberal Arts for Women, as well as a French language preparatory class. The Law College has two departments: Law and Political Economy, which have a considerable reputation. In addition to Chinese law, the curriculum includes comparative law. The teaching method emphasizes the use of ideal cases for students to solve independently. The college also has an independent library. The current Minister of Economic Affairs of the National Government, Weng Wenhao, and the President of the Supreme Court, Xie Guansheng, are graduates of the college. In recent years, it seems that no graduate from each class is unemployed. The Engineering College is divided into departments of Physics and Mathematics, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. The Medical College is divided into a general department (including internal and external medicine, a six-year program) and a Dental department (a four-year program). Most of the professors are French and Belgian and emphasize anatomy. Because they receive assistance from the French Concession Public Works Bureau, the corpses used for dissection are supplied by the [Tzu] Charity Hospital. Most of the corpses are unidentified bodies found on the streets. Furthermore, because the corpses are not living people and have many defects, the Public Works Bureau also captures live dogs on the street that have not been registered, to provide for experiments. The graduates of the college have excellent career prospects. Of the twenty-five students graduating this year, seventeen have already been hired, even though they have not yet received their degrees. Regarding the entrance examination, the Law College emphasizes Chinese and foreign languages. The Medical College tests physics, chemistry, and biology. The Chinese professors' thinking is very in line with current trends and is not old-fashioned. Essay topics are often like "My Aspirations." Brochures can be obtained from the school on Lyu Ban Road. Student extracurricular activities have become increasingly active in recent years. In addition to religious and academic groups, there is also the Aurora Drama Society, Peking Opera Society, Photography Research Society, and Friendship Association.

Soochow University Overview

Next, Soochow University student Zhang Jiazhuang introduced the general situation of the university. He mentioned that the school has a history of ninety-seven years. The school motto, "Sincerity and Benevolence," is the "school spirit." As for the organizational structure, there is a College of Arts, which has a Department of Chinese Language and Literature (Head: Xia Cheng [Kai]), a Department of English Literature (Head: Dr. C. Day), a Department of Education (Head: Tan Tiankai), a Department of Political Science (Head: Li Peien), a Department of Accounting (Head: Wang Ruilin), a Department of Management (Head: Hu Jihuan), and a Department of International Trade (Head: Kong Shi'e). The College of Engineering is divided into a Department of Chemical Engineering (Head: Dr. Zhen), a Department of Architecture (Head: Architect Wang Huabin), a Department of Civil Engineering (Head: Engineer Liao Weici), and a Department of Mechanical Engineering (temporarily not enrolling). Among the departments, the Department of Civil Engineering seems to have a slightly higher reputation. The department is divided into general, water conservancy, sanitation, construction, and transportation groups. Discipline is very strict, especially regarding leave restrictions. The vibrant state of student extracurricular activities is something to be proud of. In addition to the Youth Association, which is large in scale and extensive in its work, the other organizations are too numerous to list. The Youth Association recently held an exposition, which was greatly praised by all sectors of society. Regarding the entrance examination, Chinese is always a test of knowledge, such as correcting errors and filling in blanks, and knowledge of chinese. However, essays must be written in classical Chinese. The English test also includes correcting errors, filling in blanks, and identifying parts of speech. Those with slightly poorer entrance exam scores can be admitted as probationary students for one semester. Only those with excellent grades can formally enroll.

### Grains - The Rice Weevil's Ambition Is Ultimately Difficult to Quell

Although New Imported Rice Arrives Continuously, Market Prices Are Still Raised by About Four Dollars

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice initially rose and then weakened, finally rising again. Prices at various levels continued to increase amidst fluctuating conditions. British-run firms bought back original packages, and customers were eager to purchase them, making the market even more active. Furthermore, the price of newly ordered rice was increased due to higher transportation costs, and those holding rice were even more eager to hoard and raise prices. However, new transactions continued uninterrupted. Yesterday, Heyi sold 500 tons of July Shangxiao Jiao at a price of 143.55 yuan, and Xinchangsheng sold 1,000 tons of Siamese Number Two at a price of 134 yuan. It is said that transportation costs have increased by 25 shillings, so the price was increased. Siamese Number Two was previously priced at only 130 yuan, but yesterday it was increased by four yuan. As a result, the price of rice bought back on the market also opened high, rising from 132 yuan to 134 yuan. Saigon Number One rose to 144 yuan, and Shangxiao Gui Lu both reached 144-5 yuan. Broken rice is currently at 114-5 yuan. Six down, seven up initially opened at 109.5 yuan, then rose to 110.05 yuan. In the afternoon, customer hoarding became increasingly active, and Shangxiao Jiao increased by another yuan to 146 yuan. Broken rice also reached 112 yuan due to eager customer hoarding, which was two to three yuan higher than the previous day. About 2,000 tons were traded. The spot market also opened with 20,000 bags, and prices had already risen by one or two yuan in the morning market. Although there were no official transactions in the afternoon market, sellers' asking prices also increased by one or two yuan. At closing, Saigon Number One was 126 yuan, then 124 yuan. Number Two was 118 yuan, then 117.5 yuan. Xiaowen Puxi Zhanshi was 120 yuan on the Puxi side and 119.5 yuan on the Pudong side. Min Dang was from 24-5 yuan, and Tokyo Jian Te was from 114 yuan, then 111 yuan, and Sui Jian was 97 yuan, then 94 yuan.

The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice continued to arrive. The Jardine Matheson Shipping Company's Yuansheng ship arrived in Shanghai from India via Hong Kong the day before yesterday, bringing 9,969 bags of foreign rice for the Shanghai Municipal Council. Another 8,428 bags of foreign rice were transshipped to Tianjin. The foreign rice was unloaded at the Qichang warehouse in Pudong. The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice on that ship was moved to the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading yesterday morning.

Although the owners of thick and thin Japonica rice saw that foreign rice was soaring repeatedly and envied it, they wanted to increase prices accordingly. However, because the local stores' sales were at the time of the mildew season, they dared not stock up too much, so they were unable to do so. As a result, the selling price could barely be increased by a yuan or so. It is estimated that fresh early and late Japonica rice from Nangang opened at 135 yuan for high quality, then 133 yuan, and old rice was 121 yuan, 130 yuan. Old Japonica rice in original packages from Wuxi was 125-6 yuan.

Although the going rate for glutinous rice has increased more during this good season, it is ultimately not widespread because the season is already over. Therefore, it is also difficult to compare it to foreign rice. Hong Kong goods have only seen an increase of about a yuan. Round grains open at 118-9 yuan, long grains at 116-7 yuan, medium at 115 yuan, glutinous green beans at 110 yuan, then 106-7 yuan. However, when the prices of other goods have repeatedly soared in the past few weeks, this alone has remained flat, resulting in an imbalance in the current price, which feels particularly cheap and cheap. Suddenly, large customers began to absorb it, and the market underwent a rapid change, suddenly rising by as much as three yuan. High-quality goods opened at 125-6 yuan, and even lower-quality goods required 122-3 yuan.

Foreign Flour Rises Step by Step

Flour - The current foreign flour market is showing a tendency to rise step by step. This is because sales in Japan have been quite good recently, and amidst the tense international situation, there are fears that foreign flour will not continue to arrive. Furthermore, the source of domestic new wheat has been cut off, causing Eight Hearts to flourish. Many hoarders are buying, and the market is gradually rising. Jinlong flour initially rose from 31 yuan to 31.45 yuan, and then rose again to 31.8 yuan in the afternoon. Pao Tai flour rose from 32.4 yuan to 32.7 yuan. Huadao flour reached a peak of 33 yuan, rising another seven or eight cents from the previous day. Other miscellaneous brands also simultaneously increased in price. However, actual sales are not greedy and are still holding steady.

Wheat - There was no trading in wheat yesterday. This is because there have been many twists and turns in the arrival of new wheat in Shanghai. Even factory-handled goods are subject to the prohibition, and it is feared that they will not be able to circulate smoothly for a while, so the market remained as stagnant as usual.

### Miscellaneous Grains - Raw Soybean Oil Shows Hidden Strength

Under the influence of nervous sentiment, prices in the miscellaneous grains market reversed from weakness to firmness across the board. Corn rose by a yuan or so in the early morning, but then fell back to its original level. Over 3,000 bags were traded. Red sorghum has already risen by two or three yuan from before, and new broad beans have also increased by more than half a yuan. Although the overall situation for soybeans showed a slight increase of two or three cents yesterday due to the unpromising cake market, it was outwardly strong but inwardly weak. In the oil market, due to the lack of excitement and stimulation in the cake market this week, some speculators are taking advantage of the opportunity to sell, and are hoarding oil again. Therefore, although peanut oil and soybean oil seem to be crawling like snails, they have risen by eleven or twelve yuan from the lowest price this month. Yesterday, 400 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were opened, and the prices are detailed in the market price column. There were 100 dan of Dayou factory soybean oil, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 20 pieces of Yantai raw oil, 30 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, and 200 cans of Jiangbei raw oil.

[It was] already heard that Germany and the Soviet Union had established an agreement, which was advantageous to short positions. [It was] even further spread that the Soviet Union and Germany had a conflict, and that a US-Japan compromise was a beneficial situation. However, both sides did not believe that the rumors about the Soviet Union and Germany were true, and without the amendment of the Neutrality Law, it would not be easy for the US and Japan to break apart and engage in armed conflict.

### Gauze Flowers: Cantonese Sales See Revival, Gauze Prices Recover

Starting from 1475 Yuan, Rising to 1505 Yuan

After fluctuating for two days, the gauze market rebounded yesterday. Hong Kong merchants actively purchased available gauze, resulting in a lively scene. Purchases amounted to 400 bales of "Shuang Ma" (Double Horse) brand. Simultaneously, the "biao jin" (premium bid) rose, boosting market confidence and prompting speculative buying. Consequently, a bullish trend emerged, with short sellers posting losses of 2.5 "jiao." The current gauze market trend appears particularly solid, largely due to tightened factory orders and rising raw material costs, coupled with sustained demand from Hong Kong. Therefore, the market's foundation is strong. However, short sellers, still concerned about the unfavorable international situation, continue to sell, leading to intense competition between the two sides. The high price for 20-count Shuang Ma gauze was 1504 yuan, and the low price was 1475 yuan. In the early afternoon, the price initially rose to 1505 yuan, then fell back to 1494 yuan. Subsequently, with the rise in the premium bid, it surged to 1504 yuan, with the final price at 1501.2 yuan.

Shuang Ma opened in the morning. Due to poor market sentiment in the morning and early afternoon, market conditions continued to be sluggish. The opening price was 1480 yuan. Upon this price, sellers rushed to sell, and it soon fell to 1475 yuan. However, those who profited took their gains, and it recovered to 1487-8 yuan. Penang Special (檳特) remained stable for a long time. Later, as the premium bid rose and buying interest surged, the market suddenly turned bullish, soaring to 1504 yuan at closing. Statistical reports indicate that 8,000 bales were traded during the half-day session, with 1,000 bales purchased by Hong Kong merchants and 7,000 bales by domestic traders.

Jin Ma (金馬) "biao sha" (纱标, Gauze Bid) Market Conditions: The market opened weakly in the morning, but turned bullish due to positive news. It continued to rise in the afternoon. The July contract rose by 6.5 yuan, and the August contract also rose by 6.5 yuan. A total of 8,250 bales were traded throughout the day. The high and low prices, as well as the closing price for the month, are recorded below.

### Cotton Market Remains Firm

The current cotton situation remains robust. High-quality fine short-staple cotton is scarce in the market. Therefore, although American cotton prices have weakened, market sentiment remains firm. The "pi qiu" (皮球, Ball) transactions among traders are extremely active.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Market conditions were slightly subdued due to a slight drop in American cotton prices. At the same time, due to the continued rise in the gauze market and the unfolding of favorable international circumstances, market sentiment is bullish. Although factory purchases were quiet yesterday, a small amount of Brazilian cotton was still transacted by various "hua hao" (cotton firms). Additionally, a batch of Indian cotton was shipped directly to Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Yuan Sheng (源生) ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying 1,000 bales of cotton from Calcutta. Yesterday, it berthed at the 斯福码头 (Sifu Dock) for unloading.

### Sugar Market: Export Permits Not Yet Implemented, Dutch Sugar Price Increase Slows

The day before yesterday, rumors circulated that export permits for Dutch East Indies sugar would soon be implemented, causing sugar prices to tighten. However, yesterday, the Dutch East Indies representative responsible declared that the export permit system would not be implemented in the short term. Consequently, market momentum eased. Large Tianjin merchants have been actively purchasing "cu bai" (coarse white) and Dutch red sugar, reaching approximately 90,000 bales. Demand is relatively active. Public deals have been made for spot deliveries of grade 14 "cu bai" (coarse white) arriving in June at 91.5 to 92 yuan, land-borne goods at 92.2 yuan, May imports at 91 to 91.6 yuan, March imports at 88.6 yuan, and later at 89.4 to 89 yuan. Dutch red KD mark was at 71.7 to 72 yuan, NT mark at 68.5 yuan, Taikoo White B mark at the East Wharf at 106.3 to 6 yuan, DY mark at the East Wharf at 95 yuan, HX mark at the East Wharf at 90 yuan, HM mark at 75 to 76 yuan. Yesterday, 1,155 bales of refined sugar arrived from Hong Kong, and another 2,000 bales were being transshipped to Tianjin. 300 tons of Javanese refined syrup arrived.

### Piece Goods: All Types of White Cloth Rise in Price

Factory Cloth: The market was slightly firmer yesterday. Transactions of "ben ke" (local) colored cloth gradually increased. Dyeing factories are selectively purchasing grey cloth at lower prices. Crude cloth and twill, due to firm factory prices, have stable market sentiment. Cheap, readily available goods are scarce for wholesale. As a result, some white cloth, both coarse and fine twills, rose by 2.5 "jiao." Blue cloth and "bi ji" (嗶嘰) flannel rose (2.5 to 3 "jiao" per piece). Over 300 pieces of various fabrics were traded on this street. Merchants from Dinghai, Zhejiang Province, purchased 50-60 pieces of colored cloth, pongee, and crude cloth. Hong Kong merchants purchased over 200 pieces of Wah Fung blue cloth and Ta Sun colored twill, etc.

Eastern Cloth: Due to gradually increasing demand from occupied areas and the fact that removal permits are limited to Japanese factory products, the prices of white cloth and "jiao huo" (corner goods) have risen uniformly. In particular, the rise in the price of "Si Jun Zi" (四君子, Four Gentlemen) flannel is the most pronounced. It opened in the morning at 1 yuan, 4 jiao, 9 "fen," and 2.5 "li" per yard, gradually rising to 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 2.5 "fen." At closing, it slightly retreated to 1 yuan, 5 "fen," and 2.25 "li," approximately a rise of 3 "fen" per yard. However, hoarders continue to search relentlessly, and the supply is becoming increasingly tight, indicating a potential for continued price increases. The result of this month's futures for "Long Tou" (龙头, Dragon Head) fine cloth was an increase of 7 "jiao." Spot warehouse transactions are slow, rising by 5 "jiao," with the evening closing price at 45 yuan and 2.5 "jiao."

### Metals: American Narrow Strip Steel, High Prices Offered

The trade in 200-pound narrow strip steel is particularly active due to the adoption by cigarette factories, printing factories, toy factories, etc. in this street, and the market sentiment is also excited. In addition, the overseas supply is cut off, and the existing stock in this port is said to be very expensive. Yesterday, each box of 200 pounds of "tong hua se" (general pattern and color) was sold for 400 yuan outside the customs, and the "jian hua se" (selected pattern and color) was temporarily unavailable. It is also found that among the hardware goods in Shanghai, the stock of tinplate is the most concerning, and the American narrow strip steel is one of them. The remaining goods are also very thin.

### Japanese Warships Gather and Sail South, Threatening the Dutch East Indies, American Passenger Ship Sees Various Japanese Warships, Many Believe the Japanese Side Will Not Act Rashly

The American President Lines' President Coolidge passenger ship arrived at the Wusongkou at 9:00 PM (Customs Clock) on the night before last, as scheduled, and berthed at Buoy No. 11 and 12 at 10:30 PM. After staying in Shanghai for 22 hours, it set sail at 5:20 PM (Summer Time) yesterday and left the Wusongkou at 7:00 PM, heading straight for Honolulu and returning to San Francisco. According to passengers on the ship, when the President Coolidge was sailing towards Shanghai on Tuesday afternoon of this week, the passengers on board looked far to the right and suddenly saw black shadows arranged neatly on the horizon, which they found very strange.

Many Japanese Warships Discovered at Sea

Then, the fog dispersed a little, and the black spots were all clear. When they fixed their eyes on it, they were all Japanese warships, including cruisers, submarines, destroyers, battleships, and aircraft carriers, all heading south. The location was relative to the coast of Xiamen, 12 miles away from the right side of the President Coolidge. The time was quite clear. Passengers gathered by the railing to watch. Without a telescope, they could distinguish the rank of each ship.

Pointing Out the Number of Ships, 53 Ships

It is said that the number of Japanese warships exceeded 100. From the President Coolidge, 50 ships were seen. Someone counted them one by one and got a total of 53 ships. Most of them seemed to be destroyers and submarines. The first to sail were four or five battleships and one aircraft carrier. Then they saw several ships on the left, sailing close to the coast, with only one giant submarine, quite close to the President Coolidge.

Many Believe It is Intended to Intimidate the Dutch East Indies

Some say that the southbound Japanese warships are probably due to major Japanese actions in the South Pacific. Others believe that the southbound Japanese warships are intended to intimidate the Dutch East Indies, so that they will make important concessions in the economic negotiations held near Batavia. No matter what the intention is, the passengers on the President Coolidge who were evacuated felt no joy at the sight of the southbound Japanese warships. It has been learned that the President Coolidge will be converted into an army transport ship after crossing the Pacific to return to the United States this time. Regarding the saying that a large number of Japanese warships are sailing south, the Shanghai Japanese Navy spokesman said, "There is no formal news now, so I cannot express an opinion."

Britain's Determination to Defend Hong Kong

According to the latest issue of the Millard's Review, according to the National News Agency, the Guangdong Provincial Government will evacuate overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Macau, which will be presided over by the Overseas Chinese Evacuation Committee of the Ministry of the Interior. However, there are 1.3 million Chinese in Hong Kong and 200,000 in Macau. Even if they are willing, it is quite difficult to evacuate in reality. Presumably, this news is due to the Chinese side's view that Hong Kong is under serious threat from the Japanese side. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's sole purpose was to eliminate foreign bases in China.

The Last Base for Foreigners in China

For example, the Tianjin Concession has lost its original appearance. The British concession in Weihaiwei has moved its office to a ship. Hankou has been occupied by the Japanese army, and the French concession in Hankou is also controlled by the Japanese side. The fact that the public concession in Xiamen can still be maintained today is an exception made by the Japanese side. Hong Kong has now become the last base for foreigners in China. The Japanese side will start to invade this distant Chinese colony as soon as Britain is in extreme difficulty in Europe.

Japan May Use Pressure for Economic Aggression

However, in view of Italy's failure in Europe, Japan does not seem to intend to take any action until Britain is exhausted. Moreover, the United States is also related to Hong Kong, and the Japanese soldiers seem to have to be concerned. According to Yu Hongjun, Vice Minister of Finance of China, he does not believe that Japan will invade Hong Kong militarily, but will concentrate its efforts on economic aggression. Yu's argument is very insightful.

Various Measures to Resist Aggression

Because Hong Kong has been blockaded by the Japanese army and separated from the Chinese coast, the prices of goods in Hong Kong are high and the supply is difficult. Because Hong Kong has always relied on the products of mainland China, once it is blockaded by the Japanese army, it will not be able to obtain external supplies and will become a dead market. As a result, the Japanese army will use this as a coercion to force Hong Kong to follow in the footsteps of Vietnam. Hong Kong is not only of military importance, but also the end point of Chongqing's external transportation air route and the western end point of the Pan American Airlines Pacific. Therefore, the Japanese side attaches more importance to it. However, the British have repeatedly stated that they are determined to protect Hong Kong to the end. Considering the various measures taken there recently, we should believe that the British statement is not wrong.

### Standard Wireless Radio Company, Materials Moved Away, One Person Arrested by the Japanese Side

No. 9, Lane 142, Beidi'aos Road, French Concession, is a Hong Kong-Shanghai wireless radio warehouse, also known as Standard Wireless Radio Company. Suddenly, late last night, the Japanese Military Police Command sent military police to the French Concession Police Station and requested that Chinese and Western detectives go there together. After inspecting the warehouse, they moved away the wireless radio materials piled up in the warehouse and arrested a Chinese person stationed in the warehouse for guarding and took him away. It is said that after the incident, the Japanese military police also went to a room in a building at the intersection of Ai Duo Ya Road and Chengdu Road with the Public Concession Police Station and moved away a part of the same materials.

### Commercial Press Labor Dispute Resolved, Business Can Be Restored in the Short Term, Laid-Off Employees Will Be Hired First, But Not Restricted by Any Treaty

The labor dispute at the Commercial Press has lasted for more than two months. Through the re-mediation of Ms. Xing De of the Industrial Department of the Public Works Bureau, regarding the issuance of preferential money, the capital side only granted three months' salary, and those who did not have enough eight months' salary including discounted salary will make up eight months' salary. The labor side requested ten months' salary, including rice subsidies. Both sides adhered to their original proposals, and the mediation was on the verge of breaking down again.

Xing De Mediation

Later, Ms. Xing De determined it after several compromises on behalf of both parties. Those who did not have enough nine months' salary will make up nine months' salary, and the rice subsidy is not included. Those whose salary including discounted salary has reached nine months will be supplemented with 150 yuan. After repeated discussions by the joint committee of colleagues, in order to take care of various aspects, they unanimously decided to pass it. They reluctantly accepted the partial problem of the dismissal compensation this time. Yesterday, they also sent representatives to formally sign the contract at the Industrial Section of the Public Works Bureau. Li Bojia and Shi Jiuyun attended as representatives of the capital side. Regarding the company's need to add staff in business, the company should first hire the colleagues who were laid off this time, and the two also made verbal replies, guaranteeing that the company would first hire the old employees when the company needs employees in business, but the company is not restricted by any treaty.

Labor's Aftermath

As for the labor side, in order to urge the company to implement the promise of priority employment in the future, it was decided to organize a dismissal colleague committee to register the total number of laid-off people this time, and to add statistics and technical analysis for the company to supervise the reward when it needs to employ employees in business. As for the colleagues in service, to maintain the minimum wage rate, the two replied that the company would pay attention to the livelihood of the colleagues at any time and would give full consideration to it this time, which will be implemented soon. There is also the short-term worker issue. After the final effort, the salary was increased from one month to three months, plus discounted salary. It is said that the company will resume business in the short term after a little sorting out. The labor side will draft a report on the detailed mediation process of all industrial materials this time, which can be sent to colleagues within one or two days.

### Japanese Consul General Flew from Hankou to Shanghai to Deal with the Akagi Incident, The Body Has Been Cremated and the Burial Date Has Not Been Decided

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Horiuchi Kanjō, recently inspected the area between Hankou and Wuchang. He received news of the assassination of Akagi Chikanzhi, the Japanese Deputy Chief of the Police Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and flew back to Shanghai from Wuhan by plane at 3:30 PM on the 18th. After getting off the plane, he went to the consulate to listen to the report on the incident before and after Akagi's assassination. He discussed the follow-up plan with various officials. In order to crack down on such terrorist activities and prevent the occurrence of similar incidents, he has decided to take necessary measures. Horiuchi went to Akagi's residence to offer condolences on the morning of the next day (19th). Major Otsuka of the Japanese Military Police advised all Japanese families and individuals to thoroughly prevent espionage after the Akagi incident. As for Akagi's farewell ceremony, it was held at Akagi's residence at No. 827 Yu Garden Road at 0:30 PM on the 18th in front of the chief priest of Narita Changde Temple and many relatives and friends. At 1:30 PM, the cremation was carried out. As for the burial date, it will be decided after Akagi's other relatives come to Shanghai, or it will be jointly buried by the Japanese Consulate General and the Municipal Council. Akagi's eldest son, Fumito, is 16 years old and is studying in the third grade of the ordinary department of Seikei High School in Tokyo. The eldest daughter, Emiko, is 17 years old and is studying in the fifth grade of Sacred Heart Girls' Academy.

### Haig Garden Horticultural Show

The horticultural show organized by Mrs. Mather, a British expatriate in Shanghai, was originally scheduled to be held at No. 118 Rue du Père Froc. However, due to the prohibition by the French Concession, the venue was changed to the Haig Garden on Haig Road. It was still held on time the day before yesterday. Because all the funds raised were donated to the British War Fund, people from all walks of life, especially overseas Chinese, flocked to the event and generously donated money to help it succeed. The results were very impressive. Left picture (above): The gate of the horticultural show (below): The charity bazaar scene (photo by Kang Zuyi)

### Filled with Optimistic and Forward-Looking Atmosphere, The Impression of the Great Rear Area, New Vigor Bred in Countless Hardships, All Manpower and Material Resources are Active

Bible Society Pastor Speaks on Free China Tour

The Rotary Club of Shanghai held a regular luncheon at the Metropole Hotel on Fuzhou Road yesterday noon. The president, Bowser, the current Dutch Consul General in Shanghai, presided over the meeting. In addition to reporting on regular club affairs, he specially invited Pastor William Huespeth, a member of the club and the current affairs officer of the Bible Society at No. 58 Hong Kong Road, to speak on "Glimpses in Free China." Huespeth left Shanghai on April 4 this year and went to the southwest to plan church affairs, visiting Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and other major rear areas. After completing his official duties, he returned to Shanghai on the 30th of last month. Yesterday's speech was a general description of the various developments seen in Free China. Huespeth was eloquent and humorous, and everyone who listened was moved, as if they were there.

Chongqing Mountain City, Overflowing with Vitality

After leaving Shanghai on April 4 this year, Huespeth sailed to Hong Kong, and then took a plane from Hong Kong to Chongqing. The plane he took was very new, so the journey was comfortable and pleasant. When he arrived in Chongqing, he got off the plane and went to the inspection room to be inspected. All inspectors were polite to foreign passengers and were considerate everywhere. Because Huespeth brought things to a friend in Chengdu, there was a slight misunderstanding during the inspection. After the explanation was clear, the doubts were dispelled, and the inspector apologized and left. Huespeth said: "If a Chinese goes to the United States, and is inspected upon arrival, I am afraid that the inspectors will not treat us with the same attitude as the Chinese inspectors." There are many mountains near Chongqing, and pedestrians mostly hire mountain sedan chairs or rickshaws, which are quite expensive, and climbing mountains and ridges is dangerous, and there is almost a feeling of getting little out of the trip. He continued to say that the first impression he got in Chongqing was "an indescribable sorrow." Some people were not fully clothed, and some were dirty and filthy. The suffering and worries they suffered were far greater than those of the people in Shanghai, but regardless of age, gender, or profession, the people all had strong perseverance and spirit, were not moved by the suffering of the war, and still worked hard for the great cause of building the country. This was the most profound impression he got.

Built as Soon as Destroyed, the City Appearance is Renewed

Chongqing has been bombed many times, so there are air raid shelters everywhere in the city. Once the alarm sounds, people flock to the shelters to hide. However, because Chongqing has a small area and a large population, the relocation work has been actively implemented recently. Although the bombing is fierce, the houses collapse, and the people suffer, but Chongqing's reconstruction work has never been affected in any way. As soon as it is built, it is destroyed, and as soon as it is destroyed, it is built, so the city appearance is still the same as before. Chongqing is an important transportation hub in the rear, and cargo transportation is concentrated here. Goods transported from Yunnan and Burma, such as gasoline, etc., are gathered here. Therefore, once an air raid occurs, the threat to the goods is extremely heavy and huge. Therefore, when an alarm sounds, a large number of workers move the goods that are being unloaded or have not been placed to a safe place. After the air raid has passed, they continue to unload or load. Although this kind of work is extremely arduous, the workers have no complaints, are courageous, have a clear consciousness, and resist the tragic encounter with an indomitable and unyielding spirit, which can shock the world and move the gods. Foreigners who witness this scene are amazed. Huespeth stayed in Chongqing for nearly a week, and then set off for Chengdu to inspect the local church affairs.

Chengdu Has Become a Cultural City

The most profound impression I got in Chengdu was the development of education in extraordinary times. There are many middle schools and universities, and there are so many students that there is almost a lack of room for them, and the general refugees, living in thatched huts and living a hard life, still have the opportunity to enjoy education. The "refugee professors" are engaged in rescue, teaching with great care and patience, and the people's wisdom is greatly opened, and the results are good. There are few air raids in Chengdu, so there are not many air raid shelters. In fact, the geology of Chengdu is solid and it is not easy to dig air raid shelters. If there are any, the cost of construction is also high. Therefore, when an air raid occurs, people mostly scatter to the countryside. The water conservancy project near Chengdu is well-developed, the ditches are vertical and horizontal, the farmland is irrigated, and the harvest is very rich, and the people's nature is calm and has not changed for a long time. Even after two thousand years, it will still be able to proceed as usual. However, the local living standard is rising day by day, and the price of goods has skyrocketed, almost ten times higher than before the war. It is not surprising that the general coolies, such as rickshaw pullers, etc., earn 12 to 15 yuan per day, and their income can almost exceed that of a high-ranking doctor, but the general company employees do not earn much, so their situation is extremely difficult, and the working masses can easily get more rewards with lighter work.

Kunming Shows a Brand New Appearance

Huespeth managed the public affairs in Chengdu for half a month, then took a plane south to Kunming. He used to work in Kunming, so he was familiar with the people and places, but in recent years, Kunming has obviously undergone major changes. The streets are wider, and the shops are full of luxury goods, which is very different from five years ago. There are also new developments in transportation. Five years ago, when Huespeth was in Kunming, there was only one railway. Now there are three more. In addition to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the two newly added railways are the Yunnan-Burma Railway, which has only completed 12 miles, but there are two trains running every day, and the other is the Xi-Kun Railway, which is now being actively built. The construction and development of transportation have not stopped due to the war. Various industries have also made amazing progress, manufacturing various supplies with remarkable results, especially the activities of young people, which add more vitality to Kunming. Huespeth suffered two heavy bombings in Kunming, and countless civilians were killed. Some had incomplete limbs, and some were homeless. Some women were carrying babies and running and crying with another child at the same time, not knowing what to do. This tragic scene is really unbearable to look at.

A Street Urchin, Commendable and Weeping

When Huespeth was in Kunming, he met a fourteen-year-old peddler and asked about his family background. He was originally from Hankou. Three years ago, Hankou fell, and his family was destroyed. Alone, he drifted and wandered, walking thousands of miles to reach Kunming. The journey took several years, and he relied on peddling to make a living. When asked about his future, he couldn't answer and said that he would continue to wander, not knowing what home was. This story is the embodiment of the national soul of the Republic of China. China has been fighting for several years, and the people still feel optimistic, have no complaints, are determined and unwavering, and continue to move forward until thousands of years, improving today's world and pursuing a happy life. Also, according to people from Free China, although the development of the southwestern provinces after the war has not reached its peak, the rectification and improvement in this short period of time can be said to be unparalleled in the world. Especially the spirit of perseverance, the diligence of operation, the outstanding spirit, and the calm attitude give China a vigorous vitality and hope, ensuring that China will continue to survive and will always be a member of the world's democratic camp. After fighting for four years, the spirit is as strong as ever. This is really a symbol of China's invincibility and the foundation for the final victory.

### Rice Prices Rise Suddenly Due to Speculation, Residents Should Not Rush to Buy, The Yang Rice Ordered by the Authorities Will Arrive in Shanghai at a Flat Price, The Reasonable Price Increase of Dang Rice is Very Small

The current situation changes at any time, and the general rice merchants repeatedly spread rumors. Recently, they have been active, causing rice prices to rise step by step. The authorities of the concession are deeply afraid that various grain shops will take advantage of this opportunity to privately raise prices or hoard them for sale. Yesterday, they specially ordered the Pingmi (平米, Stabilized Rice) agency to inform the grain shops that the selling price to the retail rice shops for the small twisted rice purchased at 124.7 yuan per bag must still be 133.5 yuan and must not be arbitrarily raised. The purchased goods must be sold as much as possible and must not be hoarded. If there is any violation, once it is found out, it will be severely punished. At the same time, the Public Works Bureau has been investigating the resale of grain shops, and a standard sales form printed by the bureau can be purchased from the Liji Foreign Firm and can be sold only after approval.

Pre-Purchasing and Storing is Really Unwise

According to Pingming News Agency, a total of 166,610 bags of low-priced small twisted rice arrived last month. The first batch of 120,000 bags ordered by the Public Works Bureau from the Hong Kong Government this month has already been loaded on the Yussheng Jinan and other ships, and the remaining 70,000 bags will also arrive completely in port within days. This batch of 120,000 bags was ordered before, and the selling price is the same as before. The selling price in the market is still 110 yuan per stone. The residents of this port know that the low-priced Ming Dang rice, etc., will have price increase news, and they are pre-purchasing and storing from retail rice shops, which is really unwise. The reasonable price increase is still unavoidable, and it is also very small. Why bother yourself?

Attention Should be Paid to the Weight of Stabilized Rice

According to the Datong News Agency, the amount of Hong Kong rice sold by various rice shops has always been only 156 catties per stone, and although some rice buyers have questioned the rice shops, the rice shops always say that they are based on the usual practice and that the weight of the hemp bags must be deducted, so the citizens do not doubt it. According to the announcement of the English Association of Rice Shops, it proves that 160 market catties is the full net number. The excuses of the rice shops such as hemp bags are completely deceiving customers. In the future, the Hong Kong rice sold by the rice shops should be sold at the full number. However, it seems necessary to thoroughly investigate those who have been deducted in the past. It is hoped that the Concession will deal with it severely, and the Rice Shops Association should also review it and not allow any leniency, and value the people's food.

### Central Government Allocates Funds for Disaster Relief in Eastern Zhejiang War Zone, Totaling 900,000 Yuan

The recent war in Eastern Zhejiang has expanded to over ten counties. Before the war, there was a shortage of food and the livelihood of civilians was very difficult. The outbreak of war has caused widespread destruction, displacement of people, and numerous disasters. It has been learned that the Central Relief Committee has allocated 700,000 yuan to actively assist the affected people, which will be distributed by the Zhejiang Provincial Relief Office. Furthermore, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in addition to the previously allocated funds for relief, has additionally allocated 200,000 yuan to jointly provide relief with the central government's funds. This substantial amount of 900,000 yuan has been distributed to commissioners in various districts for collection and proper distribution, providing relief to each household.

### United States Eagerly Donates to Aid China

Overseas Chinese in Guatemala have already remitted donations to the New York office of the United China Relief Association. Since the efforts of Chairman Soong Tzu-wen and Secretary-General Cheng Chia-yi, overseas Chinese organizations and leaders from the United States and the Americas have successively joined and supported the association. Currently, the association has organized over 200 branches throughout the United States, and the committee members appointed by the Chinese Committee are distributed across major cities in the Americas. Fundraising is already underway, and the generous donations and enthusiastic assistance from overseas Chinese are particularly gratifying. It is reported that donations are exceptionally active everywhere. Even overseas Chinese in Guatemala, South America, have already remitted donations, making the fundraising prospects very promising.

### First Anniversary of Shao Xubai's Death; Memorial Ceremony Held Today

Today marks the first anniversary of the death of Mr. Shao Xubai, former president of the Dagu News Agency, who was assassinated on July 1st last year (May 26th of the lunar calendar). To commemorate Mr. Shao's immortal spirit, his friends and family have specially organized a memorial ceremony today at the Qingliang Temple on Metter Road.

### American Reporter Returns to Shanghai from Southwest China, Expresses Satisfaction After Inspection

Mr. Steele, a Far East correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, recently visited and inspected various parts of Southwest China. He has now returned to Shanghai via the Burma Road. During his trip, Mr. Steele conducted a detailed inspection of the construction situation in China's rear areas and expressed great satisfaction. He is scheduled to give a lecture at the American University Club in Shanghai next Tuesday, detailing the vibrant situation in China's rear areas and describing the transportation conditions on the Burma Road.

### Korean Gangs Cracked Down On For Extorting Entertainment Venues; Demanded Huge Protection Fees Based on Tier; Gang Members Active Throughout Shanghai; Police Conduct Extensive Investigation and Arrest of Fugitive Gang Members

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reports that several Koreans were extorting "protection fees" from theaters in Shanghai. The incident occurred and was discovered; detectives from the Old Zhabei Police Station made arrests. It is reported that these Koreans will be handed over to the Japanese authorities for further interrogation on Saturday morning.

Extortion

The case originated when theater managers received twenty-two threatening letters demanding "protection fees": 300 yuan per day for first-run theaters, 200 yuan per day for second-run theaters, and 100 yuan per day for third-run theaters. Failure to comply would result in bomb attacks. On Sunday, police officers from the Old Zhabei Police Station, posing as representatives from the Great Shanghai Theatre, went to Pudong to pay the "protection fee." They collaborated with Japanese military police to arrest three extortionists and took them back to the police station. One of the suspects has confessed to writing more than half of the threatening letters and participating in the first bombing of the Great Shanghai Theatre.

Case Cracked

The suspect also confessed that the extortion gang he belonged to was organized by rogue Koreans who specialized in extorting "protection fees" from entertainment venues such as taverns, theaters, coffee shops, and dance halls. They collected payments at the end of the month, reaping substantial profits. Gang members were scattered throughout Shanghai, operating everywhere, causing entertainment venue operators to worry about their safety. Inevitably, they had to allocate a portion of their income to pay the extortion gang. It is reported that the gang's methods were modeled after American extortionists. Police authorities stated that they are conducting an extensive investigation, and it is hoped that the remaining fugitives will also be apprehended.

### Dai Chunfeng of Funing's Calligraphy Fans

Dai Chunfeng of Funing is proficient in both Chinese and French literature and has lived in Shanghai for nearly forty years. His students are all outstanding talents of their time. Although he currently holds important positions such as the secretary of the Shanghai New Medicine Association and is extremely busy, he still devotes his spare time to studying classics and researching the "Six Principles" of calligraphy. He is deeply knowledgeable in the seal scripts from the Three Dynasties, Qin, and Han periods, such as those found on pottery, seals, ancient scripts, tripods, sacrificial vessels, and currency. He can be considered a worthy successor to Wu Dacheng. In 1920, his works were exhibited at the Belgian Exposition, where he received a gold medal, demonstrating that his calligraphy is not only highly regarded in China but also esteemed in foreign lands. He has now established a price list for selling calligraphy on fans, limited to 200 pieces. Yesterday, at the Dou Ji store in Jiuhuatang, I saw ten different fan designs written by him. The grandeur of their style and the boldness of their power are reminiscent of the Jin and Wei dynasties, directly tracing back to the Qin and Han periods, capturing the spirit of the Three Dynasties. There is also a unique collection of ancient seal characters forming a poem, which is truly a rare and divine work. Those who admire Mr. Dai's calligraphy should not miss this opportunity and can find it at major fan and stationery stores.

### Sister and Brother Disappear, Turns Out They Were Abducted; Yao Azhang Arrested and Reveals the Truth; The Whereabouts of the Sister and Brother are Still Unknown

Yao Laoda, a native of Dachang, residing at No. 8, Lane 411, Xinzha Road, works as a warehouse keeper in a rice shop. He has a son named A Jin, seven years old, and a daughter, A Er, sixteen years old. Yao is very frugal and has accumulated some savings, which his distant cousin, Yao Azhang, covets. Yao Azhang often borrowed money from Yao Laoda. Recently, he resented not being given more, and on May 17th, at 9:00 AM, A Er and A Jin, the sister and brother,

Suddenly Disappeared

Between then and July 9th, threatening letters were written and delivered to Yao Laoda, demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. Someone was sent to a vacant lot at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Daxi Road to negotiate the payment. Upon arrival, no one showed up for negotiation. Subsequently, Yao Laoda was notified by telephone that if he paid at least 1,500 yuan, his daughter A Er and son A Jin would be returned. The person said his life was in danger and asked Yao Laoda to write a reply, leaving the address as before at the

Vacant Lot on Yidingpan Road

in a hole in the wall at the intersection of Daxi Road. Yao Laoda knew that this was the work of his cousin Yao Azhang. He gave 500 yuan, hoping that his children would be sent home. However, until 11:40 AM on the 17th of this month, Yao Azhang was apprehended at No. 338, North Jiangxi Road by Chinese detective Li Zunzhi from the Hongkou Police Station. He was taken to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case, stating that the missing daughter, Yao A Er, and son, Yao A Jin,

Could Not Be Found

He requested an extension for further investigation. According to the victim Yao Laoda, when he returned home from the rice shop that day, his daughter A Er and son A Jin were already gone, and Yao Azhang had stolen a gold bracelet and 40 yuan in legal tender. When questioned, the defendant confessed that because the plaintiff, Yao Laoda, refused to provide financial assistance, at the instigation of his fugitive friends Wang Xu and others, the sister and brother, A Er and A Jin, were taken by Wang Xu and others to the residence of a woman named Lu Zhu at No. 62, Lane 519, Hart Road. Later, he heard that they were

Hidden in Pudong

somewhere. He stated that the abduction of A Er and A Jin was instigated by his friends Wang Zikang and Xu Wenzhong, who accompanied him to Yao Laoda's house on the day of the abduction. He claimed that he did not know the whereabouts of A Er and A Jin, who were hidden in Pudong. He admitted to stealing the gold jewelry and legal tender. Judge Zhong Qing ordered him to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

### A Female Guide's Perilous Encounter: An Attempted Robbery and Murder in a Hotel

Yesterday morning, an attempted robbery and murder occurred in the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. A male guest attempted to rob a female guide of her valuables and attacked her with a hammer. Police detectives rushed to the scene after receiving a report and arrested the suspect. The details of the case are as follows:

Two Men Rent a Room, Call a Guide

Su Huili, a 19-year-old Cantonese woman residing at No. 342, North Shaanxi Road, works as a guide at the Lotus Guide Agency in a pavilion at No. 25, Shantou Road to make a living. She goes by the name Lin Xinghua. At 10:30 PM the previous night, a guest named Chen Ziliang, staying in Room 142 of the Oriental Hotel, called Lin and asked her to accompany him. The woman put on heavy makeup and went to the hotel. Upon entering the room, she saw two guests, one in Zhongshan attire and the other in Western attire. They immediately began to flirt and joke.

Sudden Evil Intent, Robbery and Murder

Around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the two guests suddenly had malicious intent and attempted to seize the woman's watch, gold ring, and other jewelry. When the woman resisted and cried out, the two men, fearing exposure, took out a hammer that they had hidden in the room and struck her three times in the back of the head. The woman screamed in pain, and the tea server, hearing the commotion, quickly called the police, who rushed in, rescued the woman, and arrested the two suspects. The woman was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment and was fortunately not seriously injured. She was soon discharged from the hospital.

### Quarantine Certificates for Passengers Traveling South

Shipping companies such as China Merchant Steam Navigation, Jardine Matheson, and Butterfield & Swire have issued a notice to passengers stating that the vaccination and quarantine certificates required for passengers traveling south must be issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department or the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Office to be valid. The aforementioned certificates must also include a photograph of the passenger and must be completed fourteen days before departure; otherwise, they will not be accepted.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory issued a weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that the weather around Shandong is clear and hot, with variable winds. The weather in the Shanghai area and along the coast south of Ma'an Island is clear to cloudy and hot, with easterly winds. The highest temperature in Shanghai in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was 87.6 degrees, and the lowest was 66.0 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest temperature was 100.4 degrees, and the lowest was 70.3 degrees.

### Believe It or Not: The Art of Borrowing Money

— Ge Liang

It is said that there is an art to borrowing money.

Many people are forced to borrow money, but they often return empty-handed. The reason is a lack of the art of borrowing money.

When you enter someone's living room wearing shabby clothes, you first give them a bad impression. Add to that your anxious and worried face, which further disappoints them. Even if you flatter them in every way, even if you suppress your own thoughts and agree with their opinions, as soon as you mention your financial difficulties, the other party preemptively starts to pour out their own grievances to you and eloquently expresses their complaints. This leaves you unable to speak. Alas, having come sincerely from afar, you end up being rebuffed. This is not understanding the art of borrowing money.

To borrow money, you must first prepare a set of fancy clothes. Even if you cannot afford to buy them, you can borrow a set. If possible, rent a black-plated car and park it in front of their house. Honk the horn three times, and when the host rushes out to greet you, you should greet them with a beaming smile. (Sometimes, you should also bring a substantial gift, because you need bait to catch fish.) In conversation, you must greatly exaggerate how well you are doing recently (even if you have been without food for three days, you can only keep it to yourself). You might even say, "How have you been, old friend? If you need my help, I can easily spare ten thousand or five thousand." After some lofty talk, you can then say that banks and pawnshops have been inconvenient lately and ask to borrow a hundred or five hundred from them. Ha! The result is satisfactory, and the other party generously gives you the money without hesitation.

I have used theoretical research six hundred and seven times to understand the principles of the art of borrowing. Because they see that you are poor, they worry that you will not repay the money, so when you appear wealthy, they think there is something to gain.

So I started experimenting and testing it fifteen and a half times. (The half time was when I visited but they were not home.)

The result is that those who are happy to lend you money sincerely offer it to you even before you open your mouth. Otherwise… Otherwise, well… Otherwise, it is all in vain.

### Appreciation of Masterful Ink Paintings

— Zheng Yimei

Wen Zhengzhong of the Ming Dynasty wrote to Tang Yin, "I have read a painting album of twenty frames, all imitating the works of various masters of the Tang and Song dynasties. Some are elegant, some are bold, each extremely exquisite, truly a grand compilation of painting skills. I cherish it so much that I cannot bear to put it down. Like Mi Dian, who kept strange stones in his sleeves, what is that compared to the hills and valleys in these paintings, which allow one to travel endlessly in the mind?" I feel the same about Xie Zixian's painting album. Xie Zi has recently abandoned worldly affairs and devoted himself to painting, and his art has become more refined and transcendent, almost surpassing the masters of old. He is full of creativity and refuses to be confined by conventional rules and old drafts. Whenever he creates something, he puts the hills and valleys in his heart into the hills and valleys under his brush. Thus, the smoke and clouds under his brush and the traces on the paper converge their spirit and essence in a small space, and those who obtain them treasure them like a precious jade. Whenever Xie Zi creates a piece that satisfies him, he often takes a photo to preserve his inspiration and produces collotype prints, totaling twenty frames, which are divided into paperback and hardcover editions. The collection includes figures, ladies, Buddhist images, landscapes, poetic scenes, and stories. The conch shell sanctuary, in particular, embodies the vastness of Sumeru in a mustard seed, amazing the viewers and praising its ingenious structure. It truly embodies the transformation of ink and brush to achieve a single, profound taste. (Note: Xie Zian's painting album is available at the Shanghai Science Instrument Museum and the World Book Company.)

### In Sickness

— Jue Hui

In these times, the unlucky just keep getting unluckier: it's hard enough to get a full meal, and now I'm sick!

The first day was quite enjoyable. I didn't have to work, and food was brought right to my mouth—very pleasant.

After two days, it wasn't so good anymore! I was sleeping with a dizzy head, and the food had turned into porridge (because I was sick), and having it brought to my mouth had turned into me having to "open my noble mouth" myself, which made me a little anxious.

On the fourth day, the situation was even worse, and I seemed to be turning into a "ghost." I suggested taking medicine, but I almost got slapped before I could finish the sentence!

From then on, I kept my eyes closed and my mouth shut, daring not to make a sound.

After all, "Heaven never bars all roads," and after lying down for several days, I actually "sat up cured." I guess either my "ancestors" came to save me, or the white blood cells in my stomach hadn't all died yet…

Thinking about it carefully, it's both funny and sad!

### Quick Sketches

— Yao Yao

At the entrance of a small alley, a man was tightening his belt.

"What are you doing here, sneaking around?" It turned out to be a police officer.

The man turned around and smiled bitterly: "Officer, I'm eating!"

In front of a movie theater, people were crowded like a tide, all vying to buy tickets.

"We really look like commoners抢 rice during a famine, haha!" a young man said.

"But they are doing it for their stomachs, and we are doing it for our eyes," another young man replied.

Several people laughed.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(9) A Strange Farmer

"If I don't go this time, I'm afraid there won't be another chance!" He sat wearily back down on the dirt bed, but his mind was still racing. "If I could get Xiangqi away before the nanny's family goes back, and the three of us, husband, wife, and daughter, could quietly move out of the Li family's manor and settle down somewhere else, how perfect would that be?"

Thinking of this, he almost laughed out loud.

When he put his head on the pillow, he had finally decided to leave the next day, although there were still many difficult problems blocking him, problems that he couldn't solve on his own!

"Unless I can find Yu Kun unexpectedly." A lucky thought suddenly occurred to him. But in reality, Yu Kun had been missing since his visit two years ago. Because that fellow had always had such a stubborn temper, he would rather die than pick up a pen to write a letter, so it was unlikely that Begonia would be able to find him.

Begonia himself didn't know how he got through this night. One thought after another kept his mind from having even half a minute of peace. It was as if he were staring wide-eyed at the kerosene lamp, but in his mind, he seemed to be seeing many dreams. He seemed to see Luo Xiangqi already dead, dead even before Yuan Baofan's downfall. He also seemed to see Yu Kun fighting with Yuan Laoqi. A moment later, Zhao Si's short, stout figure appeared, as if holding the now worthless bankbook and crying loudly at the entrance of the Dongxing Colonial Bank. Then, he seemed to dream that Xiao Meibao had been abducted by Mr. and Mrs. Wang…

"Heavens! Why is this night so long?" Before five o'clock, he cursed as he quietly got up.

Fortunately, Xiao Meibao was still sleeping soundly. (137)

### A Dinner Party: Delicacies are Hard to Swallow; Poverty is Already in the Bag

— Zhong Wenling

When the assistant manager of the firm delicately inquired about my opinion, asking if I would be willing to participate in the Sunday noon dinner party, I really felt a little flattered; because generally speaking, the director and senior staff are the ones he invites. Regarding this exception, I blurted out "Okay", but then I thought, he was talking about a dinner party, not a treat, so everyone would have to take out some money. In a little hesitation, he seemed to detect my thoughts: "This time we ordered a table of dishes for eighty yuan, each person will only need to take out about ten yuan." I couldn't let him suspect that I was greedy for money, so I pretended to be cheerful: "Decided to go!"

At the banquet: exquisite dishes were placed in exquisite utensils, it was laughable that a dish of fried shrimp was served in a plate surrounded by small red and blue lamp-like decorations. Everyone ate and praised, the good sounds never ceasing. Finally, the bill came, and when the words one hundred and eighty yuan were announced from the manager's mouth, it was as if I had been hit on the head, and I was dizzy for several minutes, I suddenly felt I had been deceived, they were all big liars, the manager had cheated me ten yuan, and the hotel owner had also cheated me ten yuan. I thought if I hadn't had two drinks earlier, my face would have been very ugly. I had been intending to buy a fifteen-dollar Science For Citizens book, and had patrolled in front of the store many times, observed in the window many times, and stroked and flipped through it in the bookstore, but I always couldn't bear to buy it. But now I'd rather go, in short, I felt I had been greatly deceived.

But the worst was still to come. After paying the bill, they still didn't run away, lying on the sofa, closing their eyes, picking their teeth, chatting about this and that, still saying how delicious the dishes were. Suddenly, the assistant manager suggested: "How about going straight to another round?" Director Wang was the first to agree: "A complete series." The rest echoed in unison: "I agree!" They meant another round at night, but I didn't respond, I was thinking of an excuse not to participate, stomach ache? Do I have it? But when their eyes fell on me, I couldn't bear to show weakness and angrily cried out: "I agree!" These two words sounded very lonely and out of place at that time, like the cry of a wild beast forced to make a sound, miserable and ear-piercing.

Again at the banquet, exquisite dishes were placed in exquisite utensils, this time I didn't have the politeness of noon, I thought I had to eat enough to get my money's worth, I desperately stuffed my stomach. But for some reason, it had no taste at all.

That night, insomnia, I couldn't sleep no matter what. I don't know if it had anything to do with being too full. I jumped up in the morning, washed my face, and immediately ran to the bookstore to buy the beloved book.

### Anyway, Anyway

— Xiao Lin

New clothes on the body, very careful, once slightly old, then what black ink, oil stains do not matter, "Anyway, anyway" is old."

A friend who loves to eat fruit, bought a total of eight pears, ate six in one breath, holding the remaining two said: "Never mind, "Anyway, anyway", let's eat them all!"

The room is in a mess, smoky, the little people want to pee, "Husband, just pee on the ground! "Anyway, anyway" it's filthy."

Just pawned the quilt from the pawnshop, a pot of Shaoxing wine, four cold dishes, "Poor: "Anyway, anyway" is destined to be poor"."

The gambler lost several thousand in a row, and slammed the last five hundred yuan on the table, "Anyway, anyway I've lost."

### Irrelevant Answers

— Qishui

"Righteous and courageous" person: "You rascal, why are you抢 someone else's pancake and fried dough sticks?" (righteously)

That "rascal": "Sir, are you full?"

Elementary school student: "Mr. ×, when is summer vacation?"

Elementary school principal: "You must continue to study next semester! Lest……." (The following words of "lest" were pondered in his stomach.)

Shaoxing nanny: "Master, hasn't Shaoxing had any "problems" these days... (in a low voice) Amitabha……"

"Worried" master: "Alas! In a few days, it will be the rainy season."

### Small Statistics

Each load of coal briquettes costs 17 yuan in national currency, totaling three hundred and eighty-six pieces.

Each coal briquette costs a little over four cents and four li in national currency.

One coal briquette requires thirteen copper coins.

This is the price of a bowl of plain noodles four years ago—thirteen copper coins!

Entertainment World

### First Hearing Xu Dongming and Xu Dongxia

— Gu Mei

The Carlton has newly invited the sisters Xu Dongming and Xu Dongxia from Beiping. Yesterday was their first day on stage in Shanghai. The performance included Dongxia in "The Three Trials of Su San" and Dongming in "The Empty City Stratagem." Before the main acts, there was the martial arts actor Wang Zhongchen in "Huai'an Prefecture." The performance started at eight o'clock, already in the middle of "Huai'an Prefecture," so Jiang Yunxia's "Mu Kezhai" was missed. "Huai'an Prefecture" is the story of Huang Tianba leading his troops to capture Cai Tianhua. Although it's one of the "Eight Great Captures" in the north, it's rarely performed by southern martial arts actors. Wang Zhongchen's performance was different from the northern version. In the north, Huang Tianba is the protagonist, but Wang Zhongchen played He Renjie himself, completely in the southern style, with nimble movements and impressive martial skills, but unfortunately, he lacked a good voice. Cai Tianhua was played by Ma Chunfu, who was too old to be effective. Li Chunli, Li Yongli, Wang Yongli, and Wang Yonghe were all masters of this type of role, but no talented successors have emerged. After "Huai'an Prefecture," there was a ten-minute break, followed by "The Three Trials of Su San." Zhou Weijun played Wang Jinlong, Li Lifu played Liu Bingyi, and Li Hansan played the court physician. Among them, Zhou Weijun was the most villainous. Li Xin's chariot seemed too young, and Li Hansan had nothing commendable. Xu Dongxia's facial expressions as Su San showed great skill, and her stage presence was very steady and practiced. Her stage style was slightly lacking in length, her face somewhat resembled Yao Shuijuan, and her voice was very high and bright. Her vocal styling mostly followed Cheng Yanqiu, and she could sing very well, just like Hu Suxian's niece, Hu Jufen, a few years ago. She is indeed a strong rival for Hou Yulan. Judging from the audience's footwork entering the venue yesterday, her basic skills are very good, and she must have a solid foundation in female warrior roles, which Hou Yulan lacks. At ten o'clock, "The Empty City Stratagem" began. Ma Su was played by the golden cast's painted-face actor Li Kechang, presumably borrowed from Sun Lanting by Zhou Yihua. Li Kechang usually plays Sima Yi in the golden cast, while Gao Youchang often uses Cheng Shaoyu. Yesterday's performance was surprisingly captivating and paired much better with Yan Jupeng's Ma Liankun. The scout and the old soldier were played by Guan Dayuan and Guan Shengxi's younger brother, Guan Shengji. I have seen this person at the Gengxin Theater. According to Li Yiche, Shengji's clown roles are all learned from Xiao Ershun (Changhua), and his "Assassinating Tang," "Escorting," "Playing Music," and "Heroes' Gathering" are not inferior to Ru Fuhui. Later, I saw him paired with Huang Duqiu, and it was indeed very satisfying. This time, the scout felt frivolous, and the old soldier seemed too stiff, as if he was not the Guan Shengji from last year. Wang Ping was Zhang Yueting from the original Carlton cast. His movements and fighting were quite skilled. His spoken lines and expressions showed skill. Yan Jupeng sang "The Empty City Stratagem" several times, with Wang Ping always playing him. Xu Dongming's Old Prime Minister Zhuge Liang completely shed the feminine habits of female actors. Not using makeup makes her the first person besides Xiao Dong. Her voice is high and bright, her middle range is smooth, and her lower range is wide. Her natural talent is even better than Xiao Dong's. Because Xiao Dong still has a feminine voice, but Dongming's voice is completely not like that of a female actor. Her performance is deeply influenced by the Ma school of opera, because she specializes in it. Although she sings in the Tan style, she inevitably has Ma school movements, so she feels less steady. Her singing and spoken lines show great skill, but the "I am viewing the mountain scenery from the city tower..." section of the Er Liu tune was sung too elaborately, completely unlike the other sections. The spirit and momentum in the "Chopping Ma Su" scene were far inferior to Xiao Dong, but much more skilled than Zhang Wenjuan and Jiang Muping. Yesterday, Dongming seemed weak because she seemed too concerned about her status everywhere, so she felt too stable and not surprising. However, among female actors singing "The Empty City Stratagem," no one else can achieve the same results as Xu Dongming besides Meng Xiaodong.

### Ouyang Yuqian: New Script

— Xing

Since arriving in Hong Kong from Guilin, Ouyang Yuqian has been engaged in writing a Ningying film script. It is said that he has completed a social tragedy based on Shanghai's life as the background. The title has not been finalized, and after modification, it will be handed over to the Guolian Film Company for production. Guolian and Ouyang maintain a very deep friendship. Chen Yunshang's previous film "Mulan Joins the Army" was also written by Ouyang.

### Yan Hua and Zhou Xuan: Negotiations Break Down

— Bai Ding

The news of Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua's marital discord was reported in detail yesterday. This is indeed an unfortunate event. If both parties had not gone to extremes in the past, it would not have caused such tragic consequences.

Normally, we would hope that a mediator could persuade both parties to understand each other and reconcile, but news has come that Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua's negotiations at the home of Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guohua Film Company, have broken down.

According to what the reporter has learned, the situation is as follows: after they met, they began to talk:

Yan: "Why do you want to divorce me?"

Zhou: "Why do you hit me and scold me? Do you know my mental anguish? Rather than suffer, it's better to divorce."

Yan: "I didn't hit you or scold you that much!"

Zhou: "When you hit me, you threw chairs around. You were practically trying to kill me. I've had enough. You said in the newspaper that I ran away with money, but I didn't run away. I took the bankbook, but I didn't go to withdraw any money. Besides, those bankbooks were all earned with my blood and sweat. They are my own things."

At this point, Yan Hua suddenly left without saying goodbye, so Liu Zhonghao was unable to mediate, and the situation finally became more serious and broke down.

In this matter, Yan Hua seems to be responsible because Yan Hua's groundless suspicion has caused him to oppress Zhou Xuan, which is well known to people in the industry. Zhou Xuan once wrote a letter to Liu Zhonghao, saying: "I have now made up my mind. I feel that I can no longer get along with Yan Hua. I think his temper is difficult to change, and it will definitely be very painful in the future. Originally, I thought of only dying, but then I remembered what the people in the police station told me last time: suicide is not as good as fighting. Why commit suicide? (Note: Zhou Xuan attempted suicide once last year due to a quarrel with Yan Hua.) So I think the only thing to do is to divorce him. If you two still want to force me to reconcile with him, then I would rather die. It's just that he often loses his temper and scolds me. I really can't stand it." At the same time, Zhou Xuan said in a letter to Yan Hua's lawyer: "Mr. Yan is cold and ruthless, and his temper is particularly irritable. In the family, a disagreement immediately leads to violence.

Xuan, with her weak nature, driven by hunger and cold, is engaged in the hard work of the film industry all day long. She already feels very tired. Mr. Yan not only does not show any tenderness, but often exerts his authority. Xuan, unable to bear the abuse, once attempted suicide and was rescued..." This shows Zhou Xuan's inner pain.

Now that the two parties have broken down, they will probably have to resort to legal means to resolve the issue. Zhou Xuan has hired three lawyers, Jiang Baoli, Jiang Pingfan, and Li Weibin, and published a notice in this newspaper. After that, a divorce tragedy will inevitably be created, which is truly an unfortunate page in film history!

(Another dispatch) Yesterday, Han Fei said: "I got the leading role in 'A Soul-Stirring Night' through Miss Zhou Xuan's introduction. Of course, I am very grateful for Miss Zhou's enthusiastic support. And Miss Zhou, in addition to appreciating my acting skills, has no other intentions at all. But, because of her appreciation and my gratitude, we purely have a friendly relationship. She often comes to see me perform in dramas; I originally admired her very much, and I considered it a great honor for her to visit, so I welcomed her. At the time, I thought it was a trivial matter because everyone welcomes big stars enthusiastically. Unexpectedly, it caused Mr. Yan's misunderstanding. He personally brought up the matter of Miss Zhou to me. I repeatedly declared my attitude to him and guaranteed it with my personality..."

### After Viewing "Orphan Island Spring and Autumn"

— Liu Chen

On the eve of a dark period, some works reflecting life and thought are prone to producing sentimental works due to the infection of the environment and the suffocation of the author's point of view. If this work does not contain rich real-life themes and positive educational significance, its impact will drag people's emotions into the quagmire of negativity.

Therefore, we see that the fighting attitude adopted by world artists such as Gogol and Molière towards their works, the satirical themes they extracted, and how cleverly they used lighthearted methods are worthy of future generations to learn. Moreover, this type of work does indeed have a wide audience.

The achievements shown in "Street Angel" and "Crossroads" in the past are a clear example. In recent years, Wu Cun's works, from a production point of view, such as "New Hell" and "Black Heaven," are similar to this type. Especially his recently released "Orphan Island Spring and Autumn" further illustrates Wu Cun's intention in directing techniques, which is to educate a more backward and larger group of people through comedy forms.

"Orphan Island Spring and Autumn" is a depiction of some life stories in Shanghai, exposing the living interests of several ordinary petty bourgeois classes. We see countless people living a drunken and dreamlike life in a miserable circle, but outside of life, there are still some ideals. These ideals change their views on people's life, social struggles, and contributions to the world—they are taken to a land of freedom and happiness by ideals.

Shanghai people see a Shanghai life comedy, which is a good education. Those who accept the education given by this comedy must first reform their own living attitudes and then further reform this rotten and smelly part of the world.

### Bloody Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 11: Valiant Appearance Comes for a Fierce Battle

Wang Yongtai and Xu Jing led their troops in pursuit to the riverbank and saw that Liu Tiye had already retreated. Firstly, their own troops were too small, and secondly, they were not cavalry. Without ships, it was inconvenient to cross the river to pursue, so they set up five camps on the riverbank and sent people to report to Zhou Yuji for instructions. Zhou Yuji originally wanted to come and meet them, but upon hearing that Wang and Xu had defeated the bandits, he was naturally happy. He then added two hundred infantrymen and ordered Wang Yongtai to guard the ferry crossing to prevent the bandits from crossing secretly. He himself returned to the city to raise food and weapons, preparing for defense matters. He was also afraid that his old mother and wife in Ningwu would worry upon hearing the news, so he sent an official to deliver letters back, reporting the victory and telling his wife, Madam Liu, to comfort the family and not to worry. He also feared that Wang Yongtai might be negligent, so he sent ten scouts to constantly relay messages and connect information. Wang Yongtai kept the cavalry on the riverbank, carefully observing the north bank of the Xiaolong River ahead for any traces of the enemy, but it was quiet and no one was to be seen. For three consecutive days, there was little movement. Xu Jing said to Wang Yongtai, "The bandits' large-scale invasion of Daizhou this time is intended to spy on the capital. Although they suffered a setback the day before yesterday, I don't think they will retreat and admit defeat. Now that there is no movement, perhaps they have some trick, and we must be careful." Wang Yongtai said, "Nephew, you are right. At Chenjia Ferry on the upper reaches of this Xiaolong River, the water is shallower, and perhaps they may want to cross secretly there. But this place is the main road, and I cannot leave easily. It would be better to ask you to lead two hundred cavalrymen to station there to prevent the bandits from crossing secretly." Xu Jing said, "I will do my best." He then led two hundred cavalrymen away. After another day, there was still no sign of the bandits taking any action. Wang Yongtai secretly sent people to cross the river to inquire. They returned and reported that Li Zicheng was leading a large group of bandits in Xinzhou, diligently drilling, and there was no sign of any bandit activity along the way. Wang Yongtai felt relieved upon hearing this report, thinking that the bandits were afraid of the government troops and would only dare to invade again after sufficient preparation, so the vigilance was inevitably relaxed.
