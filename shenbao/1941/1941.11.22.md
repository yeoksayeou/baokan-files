### U.S. Conditions for Peace with Japan: Abandon Axis, Cease Aggression; Japan Presents Counterproposal Including Two Demands; Tokyo Reply Expected, Negotiations to Continue

United Press International, Washington, 21st—Although yesterday was Thanksgiving, Secretary of State Hull still met with Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu. The United States firmly reiterated its previous stance on a possible settlement with Japan. A reliable source stated after the meeting that the United States "has not retreated one inch" in its insistence on the "New Deal" in the Far East. After the envoys left, Hull met with Hamilton, the Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Bureau of the State Department.

Reuters, Washington, 20th—Japanese Special Envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura met again yesterday with Secretary of State Hull. It was expected that they would telegraph Tokyo for instructions after speaking with the President and Secretary of State earlier in the week. Now, new instructions have been received, so talks continue. This meeting lasted one hour. Kurusu told reporters in a facetious tone, "We are now making a Thanksgiving visit." Nomura said that talks are continuing, and whether or not they will meet with Hull on Friday will be determined after studying the current information.

United Press International, Washington, 21st—Secretary of State Hull met with Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu yesterday. The United States insisted on its position that Japan should sever its ties with the Axis powers and end its aggression in China and Vietnam. It is believed that Hull reiterated to the two Japanese envoys that, to achieve a satisfactory result in the current talks, Japan must sever its Axis ties and end its aggressive policies. It is understood that the two Japanese politicians carried new instructions from Tokyo when they visited Hull. Japan's attitude remains inscrutable, but the matter is now seen as hopeful. Informed sources say that the meeting participants frankly pointed out the outlines of their conditions. The main points of Japan's demands are summarized as follows: The ABCD (America, Britain, China, Dutch) line must be relaxed, and the United States must reduce its aid to China. The United States must remove political pressure regarding Japan's program to build a "New Order" in East Asia. On the other hand, Japan expressed its willingness to accept the following points: Willing not to have direct cooperation with Germany. Willing to stop military threats to the Dutch East Indies and Siberia. Willing to end the war in China as soon as possible. Informed sources say that the United States requires Japan to implement the following points: Sever alliance with the Axis powers. Withdraw troops from China. Stop all aggression. Agree to the same economic opportunities in the Asian market for all other countries.

Reuters, London, 21st—The Times correspondent in Washington reported that Secretary of State Hull, in a long talk with Japanese Ambassador Nomura and Special Envoy Kurusu, firmly stated that the United States could not be satisfied with any agreement that merely acknowledged the current situation in the East. However, the United States is prepared to consider a program of action, jointly participated in by countries in western Asia and the Pacific region, which could serve as the basis for a final settlement. This statement is considered quite accurate, but has not yet been confirmed by authorities. The correspondent also stated that indispensable factors towards a final settlement will include: Japan's withdrawal from the Axis, withdrawal from China, withdrawal from Vietnam (regarding points involving the Vichy status), abandonment of continued aggression, and adoption of an equal policy in commercial opportunities. A key point is missing from this unconfirmed news: unless the United States expresses its willingness to assume clear responsibility for handling all matters when these conditions are accepted, Japan cannot be expected to accept them. Hull may have realized the possibility of proceeding along this path, but the extent to which he has done so has not been indicated.

United Press International, Tokyo, 20th—The Emperor of Japan met with Foreign Minister Tōgō today. Although Tokyo sources did not specify the reason for the meeting, it is believed to be the Foreign Minister reporting on matters under his jurisdiction. Regarding this, sources in Washington said that Nomura and Kurusu's talks with Hull will resume on Friday. The Japanese representatives have reported the progress of the negotiations to Tokyo and are awaiting their government's response.

Free Trade Is What Is Sought; Tokyo Newspaper Says It Suits the U.S.

Reuters, Tokyo, 21st—The "Japan Times and Mail," which usually reflects the views of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated today that what Japan wants is free trade, not territory. The article stated that the United States should now be able to see that the current Japanese government emphasizes free trade and access to various resources. Japan has no plans to occupy territory. Japan has previously stated this. Japan wants all countries in the Pacific to engage in full and sincere cooperation to increase trade and exchange of resources and manufactured goods. If the United States proposes a policy of facilitating trade and opening the doors to resources, it should be able to accept Japan's program of cooperation in the Western Pacific. The main point at present is that the United States and Japan reach a tacit understanding regarding the two co-prosperity spheres, one in the Atlantic and one in the Pacific.

Tōgō Declares Negotiations with U.S. Based on Three Principles

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 21st—Foreign Minister Tōgō declared that the three major demands recently made by Prime Minister Tōjō in his address to the Diet are the basic principles for Special Envoy Kurusu to conduct the U.S.-Japan talks. In answering a question from a member of the Budget Committee, the Foreign Minister said that Kurusu's trip to Washington was to expedite the U.S.-Japan talks already begun by Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Nomura. The Japanese government had decided on the negotiations before sending Kurusu to the U.S. The talks had already been in progress since the beginning of this month. Kurusu did not carry any special instructions. In short, the U.S.-Japan negotiations are entirely based on the three demands announced by Prime Minister Tōjō.

Australia and the Netherlands Guarantee Joint Action Against Japan, Willing to Offer Bases for U.S. Use

International News Service, Washington, 21st—The International News Service correspondent learned yesterday from the highest authority that Australia and the Dutch East Indies have both assured the United States that if Japan starts a war against the U.S. in the Pacific, Australia and the Netherlands will also fight against Japan. The doubts about what the positions of Australia and the Dutch East Indies would be if war broke out in the Pacific have been swept away by the above assurances. Only Thailand's attitude remains undecided, as Thailand is currently maintaining strict neutrality. British Prime Minister Churchill has guaranteed that Britain will declare war on Japan within an hour of the U.S.-Japan war breaking out. The Prime Minister's statement has been fully supported by British territories. Australia's assurance also has the nature of formal support. According to what the correspondent learned, if war breaks out, both Australia and the Dutch East Indies are willing to immediately make their naval, land, and air force bases available for use by the United States to increase the strategic locations for the U.S. in the Pacific. It is also understood that China has also supplied all its bases to the United States. Therefore, the ABCD countries have completed their united front in the Pacific region.

### Another New U.S. Battleship Launched Yesterday

Reuters, New York, 21st—The battleship "Indiana," with a displacement of 35,000 tons and costing approximately $70 million, is scheduled to be launched today, six months ahead of schedule. The ship is equipped with three turrets, each housing three 16-inch guns, and has a speed of over 27 knots per hour.

Reuters, Newport News, Virginia, 21st—U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox gave a speech at the launching ceremony of the new battleship Indiana, saying that this giant ship is a symbol of the nation's desire to survive in the global war. We all know where our hopes and attention are placed in this war and have announced our determination that our side will win this world-shaking war.

### Japan Promotes Southern Advance Policy, Thailand Feels Threatened; Thai Aircraft Patrolling Border Shot At, Thai Government Protests to Japan

Reuters, London, 20th—The Times diplomatic correspondent stated that although talks in Washington are underway, Japan is still hoping to make progress in the southwest Pacific. Japan has not only stationed troops on the Vietnamese border close to the Burma Road, but has also demonstrated with warships off the coast of Thailand. According to recent evidence, Japan is now using the long-delayed negotiations to demarcate the Vietnamese-Thai border as a tool to seek extremely important concessions. When Vietnam ceded land to Thailand in March of this year, the final border demarcation was left for another day. Today, Vietnamese planes seem to have been given the right to fly over the border to take maps. Japanese authorities now also want to use the airfields in eastern Thailand and Bangkok and want Thai authorities to provide gasoline. Such concessions are obviously extremely dangerous, as the Japanese can thereby gain many footholds and develop rapidly. Thai authorities are now deeply aware of this danger and are making arrangements accordingly.

United Press International, Bangkok, 21st—Reliable sources here say that two Thai aircraft were damaged on the Vietnamese border this week, and one Thai person died. Thailand has lodged an informal protest with Japanese authorities in Vietnam regarding these two incidents. Reliable sources claimed that the French anti-aircraft artillery team of Vien-San-Tan-La fired on Thai aircraft scouting over Thai territory, damaging two Thai aircraft. Newspapers here reported that an aircraft of unknown nationality flew over the Thai city of Tran-Ya for five minutes at midnight on November 17, then flew towards Vietnam. Newspapers also reported that two French aircraft recently flew over Thailand's Nong-Kai province for ten minutes, then flew towards Vien-San-Tan-La. The Thai side did not fire on the intruders in either case. Well-informed sources pointed out that in each incident involving the French side, Thai newspapers did not mention Japan, but the protests were lodged with the Japanese authorities in Vietnam. Thai newspapers also reported today that ten Vietnamese soldiers crossed the border on November 18 and attacked a Thai village near Nong-Kai. The villagers resisted. One villager was abducted and killed by the Vietnamese soldiers. Officials declined to comment on the incident, but said they did not consider it to be of any importance. At the same time, the Propaganda Bureau denied foreign reports that Japanese troops were concentrated on the Vietnamese border and that Japanese warships were stationed in Saigon as a threat to Thailand. The official announcement stated that the Thai Prime Minister had consulted with the Japanese Ambassador to Thailand for an hour today.

### Evacuation of Japanese Nationals Overseas

Reuters, Tokyo, 11th—Two NYK Line ships arrived in Kobe this morning, carrying a total of 1,500 Japanese nationals evacuated from the Philippines, Burma, Africa, and the Near East, including the Japanese Consul in Calcutta, the Japanese Consul in Beirut, the First Secretary of the Japanese Legation in Cairo, and representatives of various Japanese trading companies overseas.

### Large Numbers of Australian Troops Arrive in Singapore; Cooper Visits New Zealand

United Press International, Singapore, 20th—Officials announced that a large number of Australian troops arrived in Singapore today for defense. Many of the newly arrived troops are technicians to strengthen the Royal Air Force and ground armored units.

Reuters, Auckland, New Zealand, 21st—British Cabinet Representative Mr. and Mrs. Duff Cooper have arrived here from Sydney, Australia.

### Iraq Announces Severance of Relations with France

United Press International, Vichy, 21st—France's pre-war position in the Near East ended yesterday when the government formally announced that Iraq and France had severed diplomatic relations. Iraqi Minister Bo-Que-Chi went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday morning to inform them of Iraq's decision to sever relations. Experts here believe that this move was caused by British pressure on Iraq. Under the old oil agreement, France could obtain 24 percent of Iraq's oil, which flowed through Iraq, past British and French storage tank officials, to the Syrian border and then into France. Severing diplomatic relations obviously deprives France of the right to obtain oil.

### Tense Situation on Yunnan-Vietnam Border, Elite Chinese Troops Stand Ready; Strong Forces Determined to Deter Japanese Invasion; Chongqing Circles Enthusiastic About Eden's Declaration

Guilin - The situation on the Yunnan-Vietnam border remains tense, with Chinese and Japanese troops facing off across the border. Both sides' troops are elite. It is estimated that there are a total of 80,000 Japanese troops currently concentrated in Vietnam, of which 50,000 are stationed in Tokyo and 30,000 are assembled in southern Vietnam. It is reported that among the Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam, there are the Konoe Division and the 18th and 3rd Divisions recently transferred from Guangzhou. Elite Chinese troops, including mechanized units, are now deploying along the border to deal with possible Japanese attacks. Chinese military authorities believe that if fighting along the border breaks out, it will be the fiercest battle in the Sino-Japanese War to date, as both sides will commit their most elite troops and latest equipment to the battle. Currently, the Japanese have 100 aircraft stationed in Vietnam and 80 Japanese warships near Cam Ranh Bay. Large quantities of Japanese military supplies were transported there during the week of November 1st to 8th, including 70 field guns. The Chinese side believes that before attacking Yunnan, the Japanese may launch offensives in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces to try to divert Chinese attention as much as possible, as evidenced by recent Japanese military activity in the Guangzhou area. (Reuters, 21st)

London - Chinese Ambassador to the UK Gu Weijun gave a speech at the London National Trades Union Club last night, saying that the Chinese army is now stronger than at the beginning of the war after four and a half years of fighting. China, like the Soviet Union, is resisting the Axis advance eastward and is now containing the Japanese advance westward. The Chinese army today has five million soldiers, and another ten million reserves have been trained. China has gradually taken the initiative in the war over the past three years. (Reuters, 21st)

Chongqing - Various circles in Chongqing are extremely pleased with British Foreign Secretary Eden's remarks in the House of Commons regarding a Japanese attack on the Yunnan-Burma Road. Chinese observers often believe that Japan will not advance north or south for fear of war with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and is most likely to attack the Yunnan-Burma Road. Britain and the United States have repeatedly announced that if Japan advances north or south, they are prepared to take active countermeasures, but have not made clear their attitude regarding the possibility of a Japanese attack on the Yunnan-Burma Road. The road is now China's most important supply line and is closely related to China's war effort, so the Chinese are very concerned. Eden's declaration has greatly reassured various circles in China, as they know that if the Japanese attack the road, Britain and the United States will not let China fight alone. The remarks made by Senator Pepper, Chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, advocating Japanese withdrawal from China, are also welcomed by Chinese political circles. (Reuters, 21st)

Chongqing - Well-informed Chinese sources said today that the Japanese navy recently built a night-flying base overnight on Huizhou Island (transliteration), which can accommodate 200 large bombers. Last week, the Japanese conducted night-flying exercises there. (United Press International, 21st)

Chongqing - A military spokesman reported at a press conference today that there had been no significant fighting on any front in the past week. Preparations for the Japanese to open a new battlefield in Vietnam are still underway. There are currently slightly less than 20,000 Japanese troops on the Yunnan-Vietnam border and 100,000 in southern Vietnam and on the Thai-Vietnam border. This number is consistent with the government spokesman's statement last Monday that there were 120,000 Japanese troops in Vietnam. However, the spokesman did not comment on the direction of their movements. Regarding Japan's amendment to the conscription law, the spokesman said that according to the new method, even those who were originally unfit and students in school would be enlisted, which would yield about 400,000 people. In addition, Japan also decided to conscript 260,000 Koreans, which not only expands the number of standing troops, but also serves as a demonstration to the ABCD group. (Havas Agency, 20th)

Chongqing - The Standing Committee of the previous session of the National Political Council made a detailed review of the implementation of the resolutions of the previous General Assembly and reported it to the General Assembly. It is learned that the content of the report is that the government has basically implemented the various proposals of the previous General Assembly and has achieved considerable results. However, there are still some aspects that have not been thoroughly implemented, so it specifically lists the facts, hoping that the government will consult and implement them. The main points are summarized as follows:

Regarding military affairs, it is believed that the government has indeed strengthened its military offensive capabilities, and the combat strategy has been successful. However, the direct delivery of rations to the military has not been completely eliminated. It is hoped that the government will earnestly implement the military food management implementation measures to improve this.

Regarding diplomacy, the government has been able to strive for an active position in diplomacy in the past eight months, promoting the close union of the anti-aggression front of China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union. It is hoped that it will continue to work hard to improve the overall international position. Also, the development of the economy of the Overseas Chinese is extremely important. It is hoped that the government will allocate funds to actively handle it.

Regarding financial and economic matters, it is believed that the government has made progress in handling finance, economy, transportation, and food during this extraordinary period. However, there are still some things that do not seem to be entirely satisfactory. First, stabilizing commodity prices. Commodity prices have remained high in recent years, and it can be seen that the work of stabilizing prices still requires greater effort, and must be dealt with strictly in accordance with the recommendations of previous General Assemblies with a firm determination and resolute means in order to stabilize people's lives. Second, highway transportation is of great importance to the rear transportation and commodity prices. The government has repeatedly reorganized the transportation agencies, but the means of transportation have not yet been improved. It is hoped that the government will pay close attention to ensuring that rear transportation is secure and that commodity prices in various places do not fluctuate. Regarding internal affairs and education, it is hoped that the government will publish the implementation dates of the regulations on the organization and election of county councils as soon as possible, and universally establish them within the prescribed time limit to achieve the full effect of local autonomy. The lives of civil servants are quite difficult due to the rise in commodity prices. The current improvement measures for the income of civil servants are still far from keeping pace with the rise in commodity prices. It is hoped that the government will consider the actual situation and adjust it in a timely and effective manner. Other matters such as the improvement of secondary education, the development of culture in border areas, the adjustment of industrial education, and the promotion of national defense science are all of great importance to the future of national education and it is hoped that the government will consult and implement them as soon as possible.

Editorial

### Farewell, Collins

Farewell, Collins. The Fourth Marine Regiment, established for 25 years, with more than half of those years stationed in China, is not a short time. Your arrival was to protect overseas Chinese, but unexpectedly, in the last five years, you became the pillar of Shanghai's security. Maintaining the neutrality of Shanghai's international market, preserving this piece of safe land, and being the host for merchants and travelers from various countries, was indeed due to the joint efforts of the local authorities and the troops of various countries. However, Collins' assistance often proved effective in intangible ways, maneuvering in the depths of unpredictability, pulling back from the brink, turning danger into safety, so that although the people of Shanghai were shocked and worried about the brink of war, they were still safe and sound, and the neighborhoods were peaceful. This contribution to the people should not be overlooked. As the ancients said: "The most soul-stirring is farewell!" Although this may not be said to the brave and benevolent Collins, can we not all feel the same admiration and reluctance to part? Farewell! Collins, the parting song awaits singing, the whip is about to be cracked. Your future responsibilities are more important than guarding Shanghai in peace. Therefore, as you depart, even if we cannot wave our handkerchiefs on the riverbank or send you off at the eastern gate, we cannot but express our regards here.

The stationing of troops in foreign territory is certainly not the way to treat a country as an equal. The presence of foreign troops in China, including Tianjin and Shanghai, was originally the evil result of the incompetence and obtuseness of the rulers forty years ago, who did not recognize the general trend, mistakenly believed in the words of villains, and the ignorance and recklessness of the rebellious people who abused force. This is certainly not the fault of the entire Chinese population. However, the way various countries punished China was to create the evil precedent of stationing troops and using force as a backing. The way they shackled China was that even after the National Revolutionary Army reached Shanghai, they still colluded to plot against us, leading to the current situation. Who knows if it was not due to a momentary mistake at that time, providing wings to a tiger? Today's China, although its military strength is still lacking and it must compromise to achieve its goals, the people are not the same as they were forty years ago, and the government is not the same as it was forty years ago. The efforts of fifty years of education have gradually yielded results. The righteous act of American culture, returning the Boxer Indemnity to fund students, has also contributed significantly. Therefore, the successive withdrawal of troops from China by Britain and the United States has its strategic implications. Abandoning the rights under unequal treaties and treating us as equals is consistent. China's founding father said: "I am willing to fight together with nations that treat me as equals." Now, Collins' voluntary withdrawal heralds that the day of implementation is not far off, and China's territory will never allow foreign troops to be stationed again. This action will be the beginning.

Well said, Colonel Howard, commander of the Collins! He said: "The US government has already declared its intention to abandon extraterritorial rights in China when peace is restored. Therefore, the US Marines may not return to China." Regarding this statement, although we have an overwhelming feeling of reluctance at Collins' departure from Shanghai in terms of friendship, we cannot help but express our warm sympathy in terms of public duty. As for the statement that "unless the Chinese government feels unable to protect American interests when normality is restored and requests the United States to send troops, the US military will return to China to assume defense duties," it shows Colonel Howard's vision and careful consideration. From China's standpoint, after normality is restored, it should strive to protect the interests of friendly countries like the United States as much as possible and should not want to disappoint them. However, during the period when normality is about to be restored but has not yet been restored, there may be concerns that the United States' interests are beyond reach, and it is not known whether Collins will be expected to rely on its convenience to return to China to protect them temporarily. Otherwise, standing shoulder to shoulder, taking advantage of the situation, going with the flow, and meeting the people of Shanghai in Shanghai will bring joy and excitement that cannot be described in words. Even better, if Collins passes through Shanghai on its way during military movements, it will be a pleasure to reminisce about old times, a boundless joy. Collins' departure carries the supreme feelings of the people of Shanghai. Returning home to tell his countrymen and comrades that in the eyes of the Chinese people, they do not find the American military hateful, but rather feel that they are adorable. This is because the American government and people share sympathy for China, and it has made it so, not just sympathy, but also something that will be seen in reality. The greatest achievement of reality is "the right of mankind to live in freedom and equality." The US military is a symbol of American authority, and therefore, the people of Shanghai cannot but express their deep expectations as they depart. However, the people of Shanghai are also worried by Collins' departure, which shows that the people of Shanghai rely on Collins as a Great Wall, and their trust is no less than that of their own army. Although, if they want to destroy Shanghai, then so be it. Otherwise, if there is an incident, leaving an "international relay station" in the Far East, there is no more suitable place than Shanghai, which is rich in internationality. Moreover, the authorities of the concession have repeatedly encountered accidents, but they have the strength to stay out of the vortex of the incident, and their spirit of maintaining security with painstaking efforts is also well known to the people of Shanghai. Therefore, all future measures will certainly live up to this meaning and will never allow the Shanghai concession to have any possibility of changing its original state for a time. Moreover, the war will eventually have a day of reckoning. Since the concession has no military action, it is only a market for industry and commerce. If it wants to wreak havoc and monopolize it, the consequences will also be reckoned with the reckoning of the war. Moreover, the status of the concession will be reformed after the war and has become a temporary situation at present. Why must it be so eager to dominate for a time and forget the possibility of meeting again in the future? People are not stupid and should not do this. Even if Shanghai becomes more and more panicked in the future due to the war atmosphere, this is what is called the deeper the darkness, the closer the light. The people of Shanghai can only endure and wait for the arrival of light! Therefore, although Collins has left, Collins' spirit of maintaining Shanghai's security will last forever.

Farewell, Collins! The people of Shanghai have nothing to repay, except to wish you a bright future and boundless happiness! And also sincerely pray that there will be an end to this chaotic and tumultuous situation, to eliminate the violence of sin and slavery, and to establish lasting freedom, fraternity, and justice. I offer this as a parting message, which I think Collins will be happy to sympathize with.

### Huge Military Expenditure Passed, Japanese Parliament Closed Yesterday, Tojo Said Japan Faces Critical Moment of Survival, Completion of Preparations Sufficient to Cope with Incidents

Reuters, Tokyo, 21st: The special session of the parliament, which lasted for five days, held a brief closing ceremony at 11:00 this morning. At that time, Prime Minister Tojo read the edict issued by the Emperor to the members of both houses. Then Tojo entered the palace to report to the Emperor on political and administrative matters. A banquet was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at noon to entertain government representatives and members of parliament.

Reuters, Tokyo, 21st: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo reiterated yesterday that Japan is facing the greatest difficulty in its history and is at a crossroads of destruction. The preparation expenses requested by the government are necessary to cope with any future incident. Viscount Okouchi asked whether it was appropriate to transfer the railway revenue to war expenses when railway accidents occur frequently. Finance Minister Kaya replied that railway improvement was indeed necessary, but the war was even more urgent. The provisional meeting of the parliament completed its work on its agenda last night with a record of unanimous support for any plan decided by the government. The unprecedented huge war expenses, the great increase in indirect taxes, the expansion of the scope of application of the conscription law, and the order to inspect foreigners' mail were all quickly passed to show national unity. The only noteworthy criticism from the members of parliament was Shimada's criticism of the United States.

Reuters, Tokyo, 21st: Finance Minister Kaya told the House of Peers yesterday that Japan's assets frozen by the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands amounted to 900,000,000 Japanese yen, while Japan's assets frozen by the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands were only 400,000,000 yen. However, the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands held many Japanese bonds, so this number increased to 1,800,000,000 yen. The work of the provisional parliament has been completed, and a closing ceremony will be held today. The government's plan to increase funding for war agencies has been passed in more than thirteen cases, including a 3,800,000,000 yen extraordinary military budget and a 515,000,000 yen supplementary budget.

### Soviet Official Refutes Japanese Rumors, Denies Border Crossing in Manchuria

TASS, Moscow, 21st: The Japanese Domei News Agency claimed that on November 16, Soviet troops invaded the Manchurian border and clashed 40 kilometers north of Manzhouli. As a result, one Soviet soldier was killed and two others were captured. TASS has recently been officially authorized to declare that this report is completely untrue. No Soviet soldiers crossed the border.

### Summary of Administrative Reports from the National参政会

Main Points of the Report

For the first three days of the Chongqing National Senate, in addition to the content of the education and agriculture and forestry reports, the following other items can also be mentioned.

(1) Military: Minister He Yingqin first explained the military strategy, and then gave a detailed description of the reorganization of the army, the replenishment of soldiers, the supply of military materials, and the management of wounded soldiers. The troops that have been reorganized and trained according to the new system account for two-thirds of the total number in the country. The production of military materials has been much smoother than before due to the US supplies.

(2) Diplomacy: Minister Guo Taiqi's narrative focused on strengthening ties and cooperation with democratic countries, and explained the guarantees of the United Kingdom and the United States to abolish unequal treaties, the establishment of the Equalization Fund, the visit of the British financial and economic delegation and the US military delegation to China, and the role of the US Lend-Lease Act for China, and the role of sealing Chinese funds.

(3) Financial report: The content is divided into three parts: taxation, finance, and trade. According to the report, the direct tax system is gradually expanding. The central government has taken over the field tax and implemented the levy in kind smoothly. The design of six daily necessities monopoly has been completed and is now being planned for implementation. As for government expenditures, they are not as large as generally expected, which is also related to the US Lend-Lease Act.

(4) Transportation: Minister Zhang Jiaao said that the highways have been transferred to the Transportation Control Bureau for military convenience. Although the postal transportation is a new initiative, the transportation volume is considerable, and it provides many subsidies to places where waterways and railways are not accessible. Regarding the railway part, Zhang said that although under very difficult circumstances, nine new roads have been built. The Yunnan-Burma Railway, which is most concerned by all parties, is being built quickly due to the subsidy of the Lend-Lease Act.

(5) Economy: Minister Weng Wenhao described the development of state-owned enterprises, listing the production figures of electricity, fuel, metallurgy, machinery, electrical materials, and chemical industries. Although not huge, all senators were deeply excited. Regarding private enterprises, the government has lent huge amounts of funds, but private floating funds are still destroying exchange rates and prices. Weng admitted that he did not handle it satisfactorily. The manufacturing industry in the rear is now affected by prices, and profits have decreased compared with before. If export goods and minerals cannot maintain lower costs, they may lose the international market.

(6) Society: This department is newly established, and the departments are too trivial to be mentioned. Only in terms of cooperatives, according to the report, there are already more than 156,000 units nationwide, with more than 8 million members.

(7) Internal affairs: The most important is the new county system. It was implemented in the provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, Gansu, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Ning last year, and in the provinces of Hunan, Guizhou, Kang, Lu, and Anhui this year.

(8) Grain: This is also a newly established department, but it is the opposite of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The degree of attention it receives is no less than that of financial prices, so there are also the most and most intense questions. The process has been seen in the previous telegram and will not be described in detail here. In summary, Minister Xu Kan was optimistic in the report and very humble when questioned. One point mentioned in the report is that the department has done its part in the military preparations on the Yunnan border, because the grain in Yunnan Province is not abundant.

### Close Cooperation Between Britain and the Soviet Union to Achieve Combat Goals, Eden and Maisky Make Speeches, No Conflicts of Interest Between the Two Countries

Reuters, London, 21st: Today, Soviet Ambassador Maisky and British Foreign Secretary Eden both made speeches at a luncheon of the British-Soviet People's Relations Committee, vigorously stating the close friendly cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Embassy, ​​the Soviet government, will be willing to cooperate as closely as possible with Britain based on its pre-war policies. Although there are some difficulties in this matter, it can be completed with the sincerity of both parties. The spirit of friendly cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union, and its allies, supplemented by the growing resistance of residents in the Nazi-occupied areas, and with the friendly assistance of the United States, will surely defeat the enemy and achieve a common victory. Hitler's blitzkrieg strategy on the Eastern Front has completely failed, and now the severe winter has arrived, and the German army

### "Sea Eagle" Painting Given to Churchill

Chongqing: Famous Chinese painter Zhang Jun painted a sea eagle, inscribed with a poem written by the late famous poet Yang Yunshi fifteen days before his death. It will soon be sent to London in the name of the Chinese people and given to Churchill. The Hundred Doves painting given to President Roosevelt in January of this month was also painted by Mr. Zhang. (Reuters, 21st)

### Alumni of Peking University in Chongqing Plan to Build a Cai Yuanpei Memorial Hall

Chongqing: Peking University alumni in Chongqing gathered for a dinner yesterday to discuss the construction of a memorial hall for Mr. Cai Yuanpei. As a result, it was decided that one party would raise funds for the design, and the other party would open a memorial hall in the Central Library to display Cai's relics, calligraphy, and objects. (Havas News Agency, 21st)

The difficulties encountered will be far greater than those of the defenders. The Soviet army will use this opportunity to carry out military operations in the winter. Hitler once said that he would carry out a war of annihilation against us, but he did not know that he would soon suffer. Germany can only be defeated in the end on land, and every allied country must contribute to achieve this goal. British Foreign Secretary Eden said that in international politics, there is no reason for any conflict of interest between Britain and the Soviet Union. The British people are willing to cooperate most closely with the Soviet Union at this time and after the war. Recalling his visit to Moscow in 1935 to meet with Stalin and Litvinov, the two sides issued a joint communique afterward, vigorously stating that the two governments had no conflict of interest on any issue of international policy. This fact is the solid foundation for the development of effective cooperation between the two parties on the path to peace. The British government and people sincerely wish that the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union should be placed on the basis of permanent cooperation. Since the two countries agreed to take joint action in July, many other events have strengthened this unity. In this struggle, there is only one path to follow, mutual assistance is self-help, our resources are Soviet resources, and Soviet resources are also our resources. The ships carrying ammunition, bullets, and tanks to the Soviet Union return loaded with precious raw materials to supply Britain's war effort. At a time when the Soviet army is trying to stop the Germans and counterattack, the British army can launch an offensive in Libya, which is very satisfactory to the British people everywhere. He meant that Britain and the Soviet Union's interests are mutually beneficial in a certain range and there is no opposition. Eden said at the end that the only purpose of all free countries is to eliminate German military power and replace it with world peace and order.

### British Forces in North Africa Launch Sharp Offensive, Penetrating 100 Miles into Libya, Occupying Rezegh and Approaching Sidi Rezegh, Major Joint Operation by Land, Sea, and Air Begins

Cairo, 21st (Associated Press) – Motorized rapid-advance units of the British Imperial Army yesterday penetrated 100 miles into Libya, occupying Rezegh, ten miles southeast of Tobruk. The largest war in African history has now almost entirely begun. With naval and air support, the Imperial forces are conducting sharp offensives from Egypt against the Axis forces concentrated at Sidi Rezegh, while also bombing Axis supply lines in Libya and the Mediterranean. The aim is to defeat the large German and Italian forces concentrated at Rezegh and advancing towards El Adem. Both locations are about 100 miles from the Egyptian front line. According to official sources, "German tanks at the Capuzzo Battery suddenly retreated before they could be effectively deployed to the front lines. The battle is currently proceeding smoothly. The forces occupying Rezegh appear to have launched their offensive from south of Sollum, then moved northeast, advancing towards Rezegh and Bir el Gubi in the desert. It is possible that these advancing forces have made contact with the garrison at Tobruk. Whether this contact has been established is unknown, but according to official reports, the Axis forces at Tobruk and Sollum seem unable to maintain direct communication. The British plan to encircle and isolate the elite Axis forces, especially the German armored divisions, around Sollum and Halfaya Pass by circumventing Bardia is succeeding. Experts here believe that the battle is now like a race, with German armored divisions retreating westward and powerful British forces rapidly advancing."

Cairo, 21st (Reuters) – The British Army of the Nile, under the command of Lieutenant-General Cunningham, with strong air support, continued its westward advance yesterday, occupying Rezegh, located on a slope ten miles southeast of the Tobruk defense line. According to a General Headquarters communiqué, a British armored car unit, advancing along this road, engaged Italian armored cars in the Gubi area, with considerable success, destroying several enemy tanks and capturing 150 enemy soldiers. Simultaneously, a British tank unit, 30 miles west of Capuzzo, encountered several German tanks, but the enemy vehicles retreated before engagement. While these military operations were underway, British forces continued to pressure the enemy forces making localized stubborn defenses between Halfaya Pass and Sidi Omar. According to the communiqué, the battle is "continuing to develop satisfactorily." The British Air Force, in cooperation with the Army, operated throughout the day, heavily bombing enemy tanks, transport units, and enemy positions, and strafing transport vehicles on the road south of Qalaat al Burdi. Enemy airfields were also attacked. After the Temimi enemy airfield was bombed, seven enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The airfields at Rezegh and Acroma were also bombed, destroying three Italian aircraft. Several enemy motor transport vehicles were destroyed by British aircraft strafing. On Tuesday night, British bombers attacked the Tripoli power station and port facilities. At the same time, the docks and railways of Naples and the docks of Brindisi were heavily bombed by British aircraft, causing fires. Three British aircraft were lost.

London, 21st (Reuters) – British Imperial forces, supported by the powerful Royal Air Force, have launched a large-scale encircling offensive in the desert, cutting off the rear of the Axis forces entrenched between Halfaya Pass and Sidi Omar, and have occupied Rezegh, about ten miles southeast of Tobruk. The relief of Tobruk should not be far off.

Churchill Reports on the War Situation: Objective is to Annihilate Axis Forces

London, 21st (Reuters) – Prime Minister Churchill announced to the House of Commons yesterday that British forces had launched an offensive in Libya, stating, "The enemy forces in Libya have been attacked and will be completely surprised. The British Desert Army is now in an advantageous position to test its strength. So far, I do not know whether this test has occurred between armored vehicles, but this test will clearly not be long delayed." The Prime Minister further cautioned against excessive optimism, saying that General Auchinleck and his subordinate General Cunningham, leading the Eighth Army, had made strategic advances and occupied advantageous positions. The future depends on the ensuing battles. "In the next few days, we will see new developments including many features of considerable interest. One thing is certain: the British and Imperial forces have been waiting patiently for a long time and are eager to fight. They will now fight the enemy with great determination and confidence, because we are now entering the battle with at least equally good arms and equipment, and we understand that the victory of the British forces in Libya is crucial to the progress of the entire war." (Applause)

London, 21st (Associated Press) – British Prime Minister Churchill told the jubilant House of Commons yesterday that strong Imperial forces in the Middle East have begun to cross the Egyptian border and enter Cyrenaica to eliminate the Axis armored forces there and relieve their constant threat. Mr. Churchill said, "This offensive has been prepared for a long time and thoroughly. We do not yet know whether the two armies have made a decisive contact, but the time is not far off. The objective of the offensive is not the capture of one or two positions, but the annihilation of the enemy's land forces, especially their armored divisions." At the same time, the War Office released a letter from Mr. Churchill to the Imperial Army and Mediterranean Fleet, stating, "This battle will have a great impact on the entire war situation." The message warned the soldiers, "The time has come for the final great offensive to fight for ultimate victory, home, and freedom." It also said, "This is the first time that British and Imperial forces are competing with the German army on the battlefield with all kinds of strong and modern weapons." A senior British official stated that he believes "this will probably be the decisive battle of this century." Official documents announced that this offensive has been in preparation for five months. During this period, the United States sent a large number of various armaments to the Middle East. The weapons delivered by the United States include tanks. Army officers believe that these American-made tanks are better than those possessed by Germany. Lieutenant-General Sir Cunningham is apparently adopting the successful tactics of General Wavell, using aircraft smoke screens as cover in advance, sending tanks in broad movements to cut off German and Italian forces and their supply lines, and seizing favorable situations on the ground to occupy military strongholds. However, the greatest goal of this battle is the annihilation of the enemy forces.

British Victory in the Western Desert Will Change the International Situation

London, 21st (Reuters) – A diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph states that as the Soviet Union is resisting the Nazi invasion and the British Eighth Army is launching a fierce offensive in Libya, the attitude of many countries towards Germany and the war situation is worthy of consideration. A British victory in Libya will definitely have a significant impact in many countries. The effects can be summarized as follows:

Turkey – British victory will strengthen Turkey's ability. Recently, Turkey has gradually shown a determination to resist German threats.
Spain – The Axis is gradually being hated by the Spanish people because they are struggling under hardship and famine and feel that all this suffering is caused by the Germans. They have questioned the possibility of German victory. If the British army in Libya wins a major victory, Spain's situation will change even more.
Japan – A British victory in the Mediterranean will allow the British fleet to be redeployed elsewhere, which will have a significant impact on the development of Japan's policies and plans.
Equatorial Africa – The morale of the people in Equatorial Africa is currently low under Vichy rule. If the British army wins in Libya, morale there will be greatly boosted.
Soviet Union – After a major British victory in Libya, the German side will definitely withdraw its frontline troops from the Soviet front and move them to the Pyrenees Mountains. Germany may seize key points on both the north and south sides of the Strait of Gibraltar in order to block the western route to the Mediterranean.
Italy – There are already signs of resistance against the Fascist regime and advocacy of a separate peace in Italy. A large number of German troops are on alert to prevent Italy from leaving the war. If the British army wins in Libya, and the Allies directly pressure Rome, Germany will further divide its forces to engage in defense.

Franco-German Cooperation Develops

### General Weygand Suddenly Dismissed, U.S.-French Relations Worsen, Washington to Re-examine Policy Towards Vichy

Washington, 21st (Associated Press) – U.S.-French relations, which have deteriorated due to rumors that the Vichy government is intensifying cooperation with Nazi Germany, reached the brink of collapse yesterday with Vichy's announcement of Weygand's dismissal. Reliable sources say that the United States is not yet likely to withdraw its recognition of the Vichy government, but Congressman Heidinger, a Republican from New Hampshire, will propose today that the United States recognize the "Free France" government led by General de Gaulle.

Washington, 20th (Havas) – The State Department issued a communiqué today stating, "It has come to our attention that the French government, at Hitler's request, has dismissed General Weygand, the French government's commissioner for its African territories, allowing Germany to control French territories. This action goes beyond the scope of the Franco-German armistice agreement. Therefore, the United States must re-examine its policy towards France. All previous plans to provide economic assistance to French North Africa will be temporarily suspended, and we will wait and see to what extent Hitler will use force or threats of force to seize the sovereignty and control of the French colonial empire."

### Vichy Appoints North Africa Commanders, Dismisses Weygand, Communiqué Explains Reasons

Vichy, 20th (Havas) – The government today appointed Vice-Admiral Fenard as Permanent Secretary-General for French Africa, General Jouain as Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in North Africa, General Barrou as Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in West Africa, and Chatel promoted to Governor-General of French Algeria (Note: The original Governor-General of Algeria was concurrently held by General Weygand).

Vichy, 20th (Havas) – An official communiqué was released at 7 PM this month, announcing that the position of French government commissioner for African territories, currently held by General Weygand, would be abolished. Previously, Marshal Pétain had consulted various experts, who all agreed to the abolition. Their written opinions were also released by the government, stating that the establishment of the position of commissioner for African territories initially had three purposes: 1. To achieve close communication between Tunisia, Morocco, and Senegal, which were directly threatened; 2. To unify command of the territories in order to protect local natives and French expatriates from the effects of the blockade; 3. To concentrate administrative power in order to carry out national reconstruction; 4. To find ways to strengthen local defenses in order to protect the interests of the territories. Now that the French territories have been consolidated, General Weygand's mission can be said to have been completed. The position of special commissioner should now be abolished, as its continued existence would hinder the activities of local administrative bodies and affect the administrative relationship between the central and local governments.

### German Control of Northwest Africa Strategically Important

French Border, 21st (Reuters) – Local French people believe that Weygand's departure will open up French North Africa, allowing a steady stream of Nazi personnel to enter and consolidate the connection between French North Africa and Nazi Germany before the British army drives to the Tunisian border. Berlin seems to have anticipated the outbreak of the British offensive and is urgently taking this action to put pressure on Vichy. Weygand's dismissal is also related to the Nazi attempt to control the West African coast, as the Atlantic bases on the West African coast can cut off British and American supply lines. Local French people generally believe that Weygand's dismissal is the greatest concession the Vichy government has made to Germany since the armistice and a victory for German diplomatic offensives, compensating for its setbacks on the Eastern Front. Some observers believe that Germany is now preparing to create a stage for a conference with its European vassal states to declare the unification of Europe and propose peace terms to Britain, as the German internal front is somewhat shaken by the continued resistance of the Soviet Union. This move is necessary. Berlin believes that without Vichy's cooperation, the peace offensive will not have sufficient force to be worth holding. At the same time, Germany still intends to requisition more troops from vassal states to fight against the Soviet army on the Eastern Front. Germany has asked Vichy to send 300,000 troops to the Eastern Front to perform garrison duties. If Vichy agrees, the French army will follow the Italian, Romanian, and Hungarian convoys to the front lines. Political observers believe that Britain's tightening of the blockade of the Mediterranean will be one of the results of Weygand's departure. The delivery of American supplies to North Africa was conditional on Weygand not allowing the Germans to interfere in the territory. In the future, the residents of North Africa will inevitably feel great hardship, and Britain will impose stricter restrictions on North African exports passing through the Mediterranean to France. The crisis of Darlan ordering the French fleet to sail again will occur.

### Brinon Returns to Vichy to Discuss Political Issues

Vichy, 21st (Reuters) – According to the German official news agency, Brinon, Vichy's envoy to occupied France, has returned to Vichy to discuss outstanding political issues with Marshal Pétain.

### German Submarine that Attacked HMS Ark Royal Sunk

London, 21st (Reuters) – The Admiralty announced that the British gunboat HMS Malegot recently destroyed a German submarine in the area where the British aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was torpedoed two days ago. Since the submarine was patrolling the sea in the area where the Ark Royal sank, it must have been the submarine that attacked the Ark Royal. The British gunboat first attacked with depth charges, forcing the German submarine to surface. The British ship immediately opened fire, and the German submarine was hit and sank. The crew jumped into the water, and 34 people were rescued and became prisoners of war.

### German Forces Advance on Rostov Along Arc-Shaped Line, Soviet Union Admits Kerch Has Fallen, No Change in Central Sector

London, 21st (Reuters) – Reliable sources in London stated today that the weather on the Soviet front is extremely cold, but there is still intense fighting everywhere. Soviet forces are launching localized counter-offensives. Recent Soviet communiqués mentioned major battles in Rostov, Volokolamsk, and Tula. Although Soviet forces on the Crimean Peninsula were forced to withdraw from Kerch due to being unable to withstand the overwhelming German equipment, in other parts of the peninsula, Soviet forces have recovered several key high grounds, forcing the German army to retreat, abandon its occupied positions, and reorganize new front lines. It is reported that the German army is constantly attacking the fortresses in front of Sevastopol. The Red Star newspaper reported that the German army is advancing vigorously, but is being bravely repelled by the defenders of Sevastopol. Other news from the southern front stated that the German army was heavily defeated and surrounded near Novocherkassk, 25 miles northeast of Rostov. At the same time, the German army is conducting a frontal attack on Rostov along an arc-shaped line, which stretches from Novocherkassk in the north to the Sea of Azov in the west. Despite suffering heavy losses, the German army is still trying to advance. General Guderian, a tank specialist of the vanguard unit, recently commanded the war situation in various areas in front of Moscow as follows:

Tula Sector: According to a war correspondent from the Soviet newspaper, the German army launched an offensive on Tuesday, attempting to attack Tula, 110 miles south of Moscow. They continued their offensive on Wednesday, but were repelled, although there was still fierce fighting. The German side assembled a large army and tanks to fight. The war situation in areas D and B is still serious. In two villages about three miles from Tula, the German army was severely hit and only withdrew after suffering heavy losses. On Wednesday night, Soviet artillery heavily bombarded the German infantry concentration in the town of Novobasovo. The next morning, a Soviet reconnaissance team entered the town and saw German corpses lying everywhere in every house.

Volokolamsk Sector: According to Moscow news, the German side sent five infantry divisions and three tank divisions to fight. The battle was very bloody, and the Soviet army was forced to withdraw from several villages. Another German infantry unit, assisted by 100 tanks, made slight progress, but was stopped by the Soviet infantry. A regiment of the Soviet army fought all day in this area, killing 700 German soldiers.

Maloyaroslavets and Mozhaisk Sectors: The German army had little activity other than patrols.

Kalinin Sector: After a day of fierce fighting, two German regiments occupied three villages, but were forced to withdraw from two villages after a Soviet counter-offensive. The German army in Kalinin City only engaged in reconnaissance, with some machine gun fire and shelling. The German side continued to concentrate infantry and tanks around Kalinin. On Tuesday, the Soviet Air Force destroyed 75 German trucks carrying infantry and ammunition, killing or wounding about 1,000 German soldiers.

Leningrad Sector: The German army in the Leningrad area tried to advance in the V and P sectors twice in the past few days, but failed, leaving 400 corpses behind. The Soviet side also stated that the German army in the important railway city of Tikhvin, 110 miles southeast of Leningrad, seems to have temporarily lost its momentum. The Soviet army has recovered several villages in this area. The Soviet Air Force continued to provide active assistance to the army.

London, 21st (Reuters) – A Reuters military commentator stated that the Soviet side admitted yesterday that Kerch had fallen. The German army had superiority in numbers and aircraft in the southern sector, so the position was indeed difficult to hold for long. The Soviet side said that the Soviet army heavily damaged the German army before withdrawing from Kerch City in an orderly manner, defending the opposite bank of the strait. It will be very difficult for the German army to build a bridgehead across this eight-mile-wide strait. There was no change in the war situation in the remaining areas of the front.

### Soviet Fleet Achieves Remarkable Results, Sinking Over 10,000 Tons of Ships

Moscow, 21st (Reuters) – A Soviet midnight communiqué stated that Soviet ships sank no less than 15,000 tons of Axis ships in the Barents Sea and the Black Sea yesterday. In the Barents Sea, Soviet ships sank three enemy transport ships totaling 1,900 tons and one oil tanker with a displacement of 5,000 tons. In the Black Sea, Soviet ships sank one enemy oil tanker with a displacement of 9,000 tons.

### Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament - Group Champions Already Determined - Siming and North America Triumph Respectively - Top Six Semifinals Start Next Week

The 4th Silver Coin Cup Team Table Tennis Championship, hosted by Chuan Guiqing and Ye Xuebin, has been proceeding very smoothly since the competition affairs began. The group round-robin matches have been going on for more than a month, with winners and losers gradually emerging. The night before, Siming showed great power, defeating the defending champion Zhongxu with a huge score of thirteen to three, and leaping to win the title of the Silver Group. The runner-up was won by the emerging powerhouse Juxingcheng. Zhongxu's team was incomplete and finished third. In the final of the Mu Qian Group, the defending runner-up Zhe Xing met a strong opponent, North America. As a result of the fierce battle, Zhe Xing weakened after a strong start, and was tragically defeated by North America with a score of eight to thirteen, which was unfortunate. North America relied on its final efforts to win the Qian Group championship, which can be said to be not easy. As for the Citibank team, the oldest in the banking industry, all the participants in this competition are new talents.

Once they meet, the performance will inevitably be tense. It is difficult to predict who will win. The competition welcomes comrades from the silver and coin industry to visit and does not charge admission.

### Double Horse Spot Sales are Heavily Shorted - Plummeting to the Limit Immediately After Market Opening

The yarn market continued to be sluggish and the situation was quite weak. This was due to the unfavorable environment, and many spot traders were shorting, resulting in ample chips, so the market continued to decline. The Double Horse factory announced a limit-down immediately after the morning opening, at 2,790 yuan. However, the decline in the dark market remained severe. This was because the Exchange's February and March contracts all fell miserably at the same time. The rebound in gold, and the sharp drop in particular, made the bulls even more uneasy and the selling intensified. The lowest price for Double Horse factory orders outside the dark market was 2,630 yuan. As for spot yarn transactions, all were suspended. The price of Double Horse foreign warehouse goods was surprisingly 150 to 180 yuan cheaper than factory orders, a huge difference. In the afternoon, Double Horse factory orders stopped trading and there was no market due to the limit-down, but the Exchange saw a rebound in the afternoon after a sharp fall in the morning. Today, 150 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin.

The Double Horse futures market situation, sometimes up, sometimes down, the trend is extremely volatile. This is because the customs ban on transportation is not lifted, and international negotiations are sometimes slow and sometimes tight, resulting in rumors rising, sometimes bullish, and then bearish. Such a volatile situation makes people feel uneasy and unsure of what to do. When the market opened in the morning, although the factory order first fell to the limit-down, because the yarn futures had already fallen yesterday, the yarn futures were opened for trading. The December contract has stopped trading, and the February contract has begun to appear. At first, because retail investors still had the intention to enter, the trend was still strong. The December futures opened at 2,600 yuan, up 60 yuan, and the January futures at 2,730 yuan, also up 60 yuan. Then, the sharp drop in the gold market caused great unease among the bulls, so they sold off one after another. Therefore, the February contract opened with a sluggish trend, at 2,740 yuan, down 20 yuan. After entering the afternoon, the February and March contracts fluctuated, but were still mostly weakening. At the close of the morning session, except for the near-term contracts which were slightly stronger, the distant contracts were down 70 to 100 yuan each. The February contract once fell to a low of 2,660 yuan. In the afternoon, following the overall slump in the morning, most people were panicked. Large investors and speculators mostly sold heavily first. The December contract opened at the lowest price of 2,470 yuan, and the January contract also opened at a low price of 2,580 yuan. After entering the market, with the gold price turning strong, the market sentiment suddenly rose, and each month's contract rebounded by more than 100 yuan one after another. As a result, the December contract was still up 60 yuan, the January contract was flat, and the February contract was down 20 yuan compared to the opening price. The table is listed below:

December January February

Opening 2600.0 2730.0 2740.0

Highest 2650.0 2740.0 2760.0

Lowest 2470.0 2580.0 2660.0

Closing 2600.0 2670.0 2720.0

Comparison Up 60.0 Flat ...

Coarse Cotton Fell 30 to 40 Yuan

The current cotton situation continues to be weak. This is because gold has fallen sharply and the black exchange rate has been lengthened, making speculators feel indifferent. As a result, there is a lack of buyers. Coarse cotton fell by a huge 30 to 40 yuan. Yesterday, more than 200 bags of fire engine grass bales were traded, with a warehouse delivery price of 505 yuan.

The New York cotton market was closed yesterday for Thanksgiving.

The Indian cotton market was bland and unremarkable. First, the stock market rose sharply, causing speculators to buy in and the price to rise. Then, professional traders sold off, and some bulls closed positions, causing a slight decline. As a result, yesterday's closing prices rose or fell by about half a rupee each. It is also predicted that the market situation at the opening today will be similar to the closing prices.

### Consistent Selling Pressure - Gold Price Plummets - Down 2,250 Yuan

Yesterday, the gold market's spot market and dark market saw a sudden expansion of the downward trend, tending to fall. The price successively broke through the 18,000 yuan and 17,000 yuan marks. It once again entered the 16,000 yuan mark. The bearish rumors caused by the new negotiations between the United States and Japan became even more prevalent, and all parties became even more apprehensive. Therefore, although there was a huge amount of hoarding by banks, with securities firms and remittance merchants each entering about 1,200 taels, and Decheng entering more than 400 taels, Xianghe dumped 1,020 taels, Xiangxing Yong sold 500 taels, Shunyuan sold 400 taels, and Mingfeng sold 240 taels. The supply of Tianyuan and other firms exceeded demand, causing the price to plummet from 17,950 yuan to a low of 15,800 yuan, which is one-third lower than the all-time high of 23,100 yuan on October 31. In the afternoon, low-price buyers became active, but the market situation had already weakened, so the price rebounded by 1,000 yuan, but then fell sharply again, and ultimately closed down 1,250 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 24,940 taels. The lowest price for gold ornaments was 1,620 yuan, and the final price was 1,640 yuan, down 230 yuan. Silver bullion was down 2 yuan, at 24 yuan. The black market fell to about 20 yuan.

Cash Prices Broke Through Two Major Levels in a Row

Since morning, every bar (10 taels) was already under selling pressure when the market opened at 9 o'clock, and it had already been pushed down to within 18,000 yuan, at 17,700 yuan. When Shihe and Hongqing Yong sold down to as low as 17,600 yuan, Yongcheng, Hesheng, and securities firms bought up, and the price immediately soared by 350 yuan, to 17,950 yuan. Shihe then began to sell off again, and Chengji, Yifeng, and Tianyuan also sold off. The price then plummeted again by 1,150 yuan, falling to 16,800 yuan. Gonghe, Mingfeng, securities firms, etc. vigorously entered the market, raising the price by 700 yuan, reaching 17,500 yuan. However, amid rumors of negative news, selling pressure soon rose again. Tianyuan, Xianghe, Xiangxing Yong, Mingfeng, Yifeng, Gonghe, and Hesheng sold more and more vigorously, and the market price plummeted again by 1,700 yuan, falling to 15,800 yuan at noon. The closing price at noon was 15,900 yuan. When the market opened at 2 pm, the price was still 15,900 yuan. Tianyuan and Mingfeng suddenly covered their short positions, and Chengfei, Hesheng, and securities firms and remittance merchants also entered the market, and the price suddenly rose, soaring by 1,000 yuan, reaching 16,900 yuan. Xianghe, Yongcheng, Xiangxing Yong, and Shunyuan sold vigorously, and the price fell back to the 16,000 yuan mark. This shows that people's hearts are turned downwards. The closing price was 16,100 yuan, down a huge 2,250 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been reported that it has fallen for two consecutive days, a total of 3,430 yuan. On the same day, the cash store's own brand of gold had a selling price of 16,300 yuan, and the purchase price was 1,000 yuan lower than the selling price.

Gold Ornaments Down 230 Yuan

The exchange price of gold ornaments per tael in jewelry stores was lowered seven times by Datonghang and Xintonghang in the morning, for a total decrease of 250 yuan, retreating to 1,620 yuan. In the afternoon, it rebounded by 80 yuan, to 1,700 yuan, and then fell again by 60 yuan, to 1,640 yuan (purchase price minus 150 yuan), down 230 yuan.

### Black Market Exchange Rate Sought After All Day - No Buyers Found - Foreign Currency Suffers a Great Blow - US Dollars Once Entered at 30 Yuan

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday, the Central Bank and HSBC's posted prices had no ups and downs. The prices of HSBC and other small counter prices were all flat. In the black market for British and American exchanges, Chinese merchants were seeking to sell all day long, but there was little demand from importers, so the British exchange rate of 2/1/25 and the American exchange rate of 3/3.75 were available for settlement, but there were no transactions. Even telegraphic transfers drawn in the United States were not asked about.

Hong Kong, 21st (Friday) Electricity, This morning the exchange market opened stable and abnormal, the market situation still has no honor or disgrace,

### Domestic Debt Remains Popular

The black market for public bonds fluctuated greatly yesterday afternoon, with a difference of several jiao per yuan. Those who raised the price were afraid that it would not be high enough, but the high price attracted distant goods, and spot goods were also flowing out. It was said that the negotiations between Japan and the United States were going smoothly, but the matter was still in a standstill. Those holding goods were hanging on for a good price, but in fact the market was still speculating, with different opinions and different views. Type C rose to 71 yuan, which is still the highest price in nearly two months, but the trend may not necessarily shrink suddenly. Yesterday morning, Type C opened at 70 yuan, and then gradually rose, approaching 71 yuan. There were quite a few buyers in the market. Tongyi, Dazhong, Xiexing, Yuanlian, Yishun, Tai and general retail investors all bought in. The popularity of the market was excellent. When the market opened in the afternoon, Senji bought in first, and Dazhong Shengxing Lianhe and others continued to buy in. Type C broke through the 71 yuan mark, which caused spot goods to flow out of the financial industry. Yitai, Dingkang, Runde, Yifei, etc. entered Type C and then retreated to 70 yuan at the close. The situation was confusing. As a result, the market price, except for Type D, which rose sharply by 1 yuan and 5 jiao, the rest rose slightly by 1 jiao, 3 jiao to 5 jiao. The transaction volume was nearly 3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below. Category Highest Lowest Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day

In stock trading, 400 shares of new shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory were traded, with a price of 32 yuan and 5 jiao per share.

In addition, the OTC market outside the public exchange was confusing. At first, due to the weekend short covering, the price did not plummet along with gold and yarn, etc. The market situation was stable for a long time, and finally, due to the release of floating longs, the price was forced to decline.

### Aboard the President Liner to the Philippines: American Troops Withdraw in Two Batches; Troop Transport Ship "President Madison" Arrives; Defense Zone Taken Over by the Shanghai Municipal Council; British Embassy Officially Announces Evacuation of Nationals on "Anhui"

The American President Lines' mail steamer "President Madison" arrived punctually yesterday (at 3:30 PM) and berthed at buoys 14 and 15. Passengers disembarked at the New Customs wharf between 5 PM and 6 PM yesterday via the company's small launches. It is reported that the steamer is scheduled to depart for the Philippines next Tuesday or Wednesday. A portion of the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai will also withdraw to Luzon on this vessel. The regiment's base began transporting materials to Wharf No. 4 on the Bund yesterday morning, loading them onto iron barges for transport to the large ship, and the withdrawal was exceptionally busy throughout the day. Another portion of the American troops is planned to leave on the "President Harrison" liner. This ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th, but it is now known that there has been a slight delay and it will probably not arrive until the 27th, with departure scheduled for the 29th or Sunday (the 30th). Both liners will be carrying a large quantity of American goods for transshipment, but will not be loading Shanghai export goods.

Fourth Regiment's Withdrawal in Two Batches

The U.S. Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai will withdraw in two batches, and on both occasions, they will march in formation along Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road eastward to board the ships, thus ending their 14-year history in Shanghai. It is expected that Chinese and foreign citizens will gather along the roadside at that time to see off the American troops. One or two of the ships evacuating nationals will also carry American civilians who wish to evacuate. According to sources at the American President Lines, there have not been many Americans booking tickets so far.

Howard Bids Farewell to All Parties

Furthermore, Colonel Howard, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment, paid farewell visits to the British, French, and Italian military authorities in the city yesterday morning. Colonel Howard, accompanied by Major Hamilton, successively met with Major Artigue, commander of the French Infantry Mixed Battalion in China, Lieutenant Colonel Galetti of the Italian forces, and Commander Hullett of the British Navy. From 6 PM to 8 PM last night, the American Chamber of Commerce hosted Colonel Howard and other American officers at the American Club. In the evening, the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Fontana, hosted a farewell banquet for Colonel Howard and Major Hamilton. The American Club will be open on Monday evening for American officers and soldiers to bid farewell to friends.

British Nationals Evacuated on the "Anhui"

The British Embassy in Shanghai officially announced yesterday morning that the British ship "Anhui" will sail from Shanghai around the 28th of this month, carrying British nationals evacuated from Japanese-occupied areas of China. According to a British official answering reporters' questions, it is hoped that British nationals in North China will arrive in Shanghai as soon as possible to board the "Anhui." When asked about the destination of the "Anhui," the official replied that this matter had not yet been finally decided, but it could be stated that when the "Anhui" evacuated British nationals from Japan, it sailed to India. The ship can carry 500-600 passengers. When the authorities notify British nationals to board the ship, they will include detailed regulations regarding the amount of luggage allowed. As for reasonable personal luggage, it will not be restricted.

British to Send Further Ships for Evacuation

It is now hoped that the "Anhui" will not be required to sail north to Tianjin, as the authorities are now preparing to ensure that British nationals in North China arrive in Shanghai as early as possible to catch the "Anhui." The British Embassy's announcement stated roughly that arrangements have been made for the "Anhui" to arrive in Shanghai around November 28 to carry evacuated British nationals from the occupied areas. However, the ship has limited capacity, and there are many registered British nationals, so it will not be able to carry all of them. However, the authorities will soon find a way to send more ships to Shanghai to evacuate nationals.

Some British Nationals Plan to Take a French Ship

Furthermore, it is reported that some British and American nationals evacuating from Shanghai plan to take the Messageries Maritimes' "Benares Saint-Hilaire" to Manila to change ships back to America. This ship is scheduled to cast off from buoys 12 and 13 in the Huangpu River at 3 PM this afternoon and sail to Manila. It is also known that the company has three more ships sailing to Shanghai this month: the "Los" is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd, carrying a large quantity of rice from Saigon; the "General Joffre," loaded with 2,800 bags of rice, also stopping at Manila, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th; and the "D'Artagnan," also loaded with 4,815 bags of rice, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 29th.

Defense to be Received by Police

The question of who will take over the defense of Sector C of the International Settlement after the withdrawal of the U.S. Fourth Regiment remains to be discussed and announced by the Defense Forces Special Committee. It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department will take over completely, and there should be no problems with the handover at that time. However, there is no definite information on how the defense will be arranged thereafter.

### Shanghai Postal Rates to Increase Next Month

Regarding the increase in domestic postal rates by the Shanghai Postal Administration, the Datong News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Wang Weisheng, the postal assistant. He admitted that the Southwest Postal Administration had indeed started raising prices on the 1st of this month. Shanghai, due to environmental reasons, requires considerable time for coordination. However, according to his information, this matter can be implemented no later than the 1st of next month. He also said that from the 1st of next month, in addition to Shanghai implementing the price increase, other occupied areas and North China can also begin simultaneously, and the amount of the postal rate increase will be the same as that implemented in the Southwest, without any differences. At present, the Southwest and Fujian-Zhejiang have already implemented the price increase, and it is unavoidable that there are differences in postal rates between the various places and Shanghai and North China. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon at the beginning of implementation and is not surprising.

### Funeral Parlors and Coffin Depositories to Increase Depository Fees

Funeral parlors and coffin depositories, newly emerging businesses in the city after the war, have recently claimed that expenses such as disinfectants, taxes, timber, water, electricity, and employee salaries have increased. From January 1 next year, all fees will be increased by 50% compared to the old prices, which will further increase the burden on the common people who deposit coffins.

### Yangtze River Steamers All Requisitioned; Japanese Transporting Troops to Hubei; "Fengyang Maru" Sails from Gaochangmiao; Extremely Strict Inspection of Food and Drink on Board

Since the Chinese army left Wuhan, the Yangtze River route has been completely controlled by the Japanese Navy, and shipping is monopolized by the Japanese company, Toa Shipping, formerly Nisshin Shipping. Originally, there were seven or eight Yangtze River steamers, including the "Xiangyang Maru," "Fengyang Maru," and "Yueyang Maru," which has now expanded to over twenty vessels.

Recently, they have been requisitioned by the Japanese Navy, mostly for transporting troops. The "Fengyang Maru" sailed from Gaochangmiao on the 18th of this month with a ship full of troops (approximately one thousand). The crew, sailors, and other workers of the "Fengyang Maru" were subjected to extremely strict inspections. Their resumes had to be registered in detail again, and the food and drink on board were also inspected. The water supply had to be checked every two hours. The troops being transported were not Japanese. There are also over ten Japanese ships loading troops in Nanjing to go to Yuezhou. It is unknown what the Japanese army intends to do in the near future. Most of the Yangtze River steamers of the Toa Shipping Company are now suspended from operation for transporting troops.

### Passenger Cabin Bookings to Hong Kong Not Allowed; Tickets Only Sold Six Days Before Departure

Currently, shipping between Shanghai and Hong Kong relies entirely on the British companies, Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson. The Hong Kong government's regulations for passengers to Hong Kong are extremely strict, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the British Embassy has ordered the two companies that bookings for all classes of cabins to Hong Kong are not allowed. Tickets can only be sold six days before a certain ship's confirmed departure date from Shanghai to Hong Kong; otherwise, they will be invalid.

### Expansion of Controlled Goods Scope for Imports and Shanghai Products; Market Transactions to Reduce Speculation; Materials Committee to be Reorganized

Since the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Liddell, returned to Shanghai, he submitted a report to the Council stating that the Price Stabilization Committee will fully support the authorities of the two settlements in controlling commodity prices. Therefore, the Council has decided to actively implement and expand the scope of control over all daily necessities. It plans to abolish the existing Materials Committee and establish three new committees for coal, rice, and daily necessities, to further control the import, distribution, and production of the controlled items, in order to reduce market speculation and achieve greater results.

Scope of Price Limits to Expand

The Shanghai Municipal Council has currently issued price limits for over 360 items. In the future, the scope of these restrictions will be further expanded. The Coal Committee will have subcommittees for industrial and domestic use. The Rice Committee will have subcommittees for wheat and flour. The Daily Necessities Committee will include importers and manufacturers, with experts as members, so that all control measures can be thoroughly implemented. Those who violate the control regulations will be subject to the most severe penalties, in order to completely eliminate speculative profiteering.

Random Inspection of Store Accounts

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council stipulated the maximum retail prices for several hundred items such as daily necessities, groceries, and medicines from the 18th, it will now ensure that retailers sell at the stipulated prices and prevent retailers from creating black market transactions. It will order all stores to record the quantity and price of goods sold daily in their accounts, for inspection by Council officials at any time. The Council will also implement this for foreign merchants who have jurisdictional rights and has the right to inspect their accounts.

Flour, Coal, and Oil to be Controlled Soon

The Shanghai Municipal Council's efforts to promote the control of commodity prices in the International Settlement are currently preparing new measures to crack down on profiteering and hoarding, which will be announced within a few days. These measures concern the control of flour, coal, and edible oil. However, the details have not been disclosed. An official of the Council stated that the Council has specially ordered 64,000 bags of flour worth over 2 million yuan from the United States, which are expected to arrive in Shanghai within ten days. This is the first batch, as the Council has prepared to continue purchasing 100,000 bags of flour. The Council will also procure the first batch of 500 tons of edible oil within a few days, indicating that the Council will lower oil prices as soon as possible.

Gordon Road Police Station's Price Control Achievements

The Council previously saw that rice prices were rising endlessly and therefore implemented control, limiting the rice price to 130 yuan per dan (approximately 100 kg). It also directly purchased the best quality foreign rice from the producing areas and transported it to Shanghai to supply the needs of the citizens. Western specialists were appointed to check the standards of the rice quality, and a retail outlet was specially set up next to the Gordon Road Police Station. Each person was limited to purchasing one dou (approximately 10 liters), or even 1.2 liters, priced at 13 yuan per dou in legal tender. Because the location is spacious, there are many staff members, and they are all experienced, they are all kind and approachable to retail customers, and the order is orderly, without any crowding. Each minute they can serve over one hundred and three people. According to statistics from last week, the maximum number of people purchasing rice per day was 10,384, and the average number of people per day was about 7,000 to 8,000. Rice purchasing time is from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, so that people working in factories in the western district have sufficient time to purchase rice, including Sundays and public holidays. The citizens are very pleased.

### Panama Ship Wrecked at the Mouth of the Song River

The Panama freighter "Santaylena Iz" ran aground outside the mouth of the Wusong River on Wednesday night while sailing from Shanghai to Manila. This is the second ship to be wrecked outside the mouth in the past three days. The previous ship was the Japanese "Basae Maru," which sank outside the mouth, killing 200 people. According to people at the East Asia Company, which manages the "Santaylena Iz," the ship was not carrying passengers, and the general cargo was not valuable. After receiving the report here, the "Carmen Maeler" was immediately dispatched to the scene to provide assistance. As for the damage to the freighter or the casualties of the crew, details will not be known until the "Carmen Maeler" returns to Shanghai. It is currently impossible to communicate with the freighter. At the same time, according to Japanese shipping sources, divers have been dispatched to explore the "Basae Maru" since it sank on Sunday, but the ship has not yet been found.

The 29th lecture of the Rongwu Buddhist Lecture Society, the second term of the National Studies lecture series, will still be held on the fourth floor of the Chinese Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road, starting at 2:00 PM on the 23rd.

Bread and Mantou Industry's Flour Inventory Survey

The Bread and Mantou Industry Association, in order to prevent hoarding by members, dispatched investigators to various bread and mantou shops from the 13th to investigate flour stocks and daily requirements, etc., which was completed yesterday. The association has over 400 members in the city. 260 shops applied to continue supplying flour at reasonable prices. As of the 17th, the total flour in stock was 1,018 bags, but none exceeded one month's self-use requirements. The daily flour requirement was 386 bags, which was reported to the Municipal Council for record. In addition, the investigation of member shops that have not yet joined the association is also underway, and it is hoped that information on all supply and demand matters related to flour will be reported to the investigation department of the Shanghai Bread and Mantou Industry Association at 202 Guangxi Road within a short period of time, so as to collect and statistically manage inventory and sales.

### This Year's Winter Relief More Important Than Previous Years; Hope Charities Handle it Carefully; Refugee Shelters Pilot Self-Sufficiency

The United Federation of Charities of Shanghai, seeing that prices are soaring and people are struggling to make a living, although they have been suppressed, they are still far from what they used to be. The poor have no savings for clothing and food, and winter relief is more important than ever before. Now that the weather is turning cold, urgent discussions are needed. A meeting of various groups will soon be convened to discuss relief measures. Since the weather suddenly turned cold, the number of corpses on the streets has also increased again. Pushan Villa collected 19 adult corpses and 53 child corpses yesterday.

Expand Congee Distribution

The Charity Federation Relief Association, located in Renji Hall on Sixth Malu, has established dozens of shelters to relieve disaster-stricken refugees since the August 13th Incident, sheltering as many as 60,000 to 70,000 refugees. They have been gradually dispersed over the past four years. So far, the Ciyuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road and the First and Second Women and Children Relief Centers still house more than 4,000 women, children, and orphans. In March of this year, a temporary congee distribution center was opened in the shelter, with about 3,000 people eating congee every day. It has been ten months now. As winter approaches and the severe cold presses in, the helpless and hidden poor are even more pitiful. The Association has decided to expand the number of congee eaters to 6,000 from January 1, 31st year of the Republic. All those who register, regardless of age, must provide two one-inch photos. After review, they will be issued a congee eating certificate for daily collection. The Association also plans to set up congee distribution points in Xujiahui. It is also reported that the Ningbo Road, Zhejiang Road, Dong Gujia Lane China Jinsheng Association, etc., seeing that this year's winter relief is serious, especially attention should be paid to the helpless and hidden poor, and they plan to unite with fellow benevolent groups to conduct a thorough investigation and provide food rations according to the population.

Refugee Self-Sufficiency

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Cilian General Association, and the Cilian Branch, after a previous meeting, decided that, in addition to the elderly, weak, disabled, women, children, and school-age children in the various shelters being adjusted separately and allowed to stay, all able-bodied adult refugees would be dismissed. It was stipulated that each adult would be given 50 yuan and each child 38 yuan. However, prices continue to soar, and it is not easy for refugees to find work outside. There are still over a thousand people temporarily living in the First Shelter on Dunxin Road who cannot be dismissed for a while. It is now heard that the Association has decided to pilot semi-self-sufficiency for these able-bodied refugees who have work, that is, to provide one meal of congee as usual every morning, and they must purchase the afternoon meal themselves. Rice that costs 35 cents per catty will only be sold for 20 cents. Those who stop working or contract a disease will still be exempt from self-sufficiency. If it is found that they are physically weak and unable to work, they will be sent to the old and weak shelters to stay. This measure was first piloted on the 15th of this month. On the one hand, it saves on supplies so that they can be maintained for a longer period of time, and on the other hand, it raises the refugees' awareness of self-reliance, so that they strive to participate in production and gradually break away from refugee life.

### Wife of a Certain Notable Organizes Home Economics Research Association

The wife of a certain notable in the city, in order to promote thrift and implement a new life, has united with many like-minded women from the women's circle to discuss how to reform many bad habits in ordinary families. It is now heard that a "Home Economics Discussion Association" has been organized. Members must strictly adhere to the creeds of "no mahjong," "no smoking," and "no unnecessary socializing," and strive for thrift.

### Second Session of the Shen Bao Scholarship Begins; Warm Response from All Sectors; Anonymous Elderly Man Suggests Increasing Primary School Slots; Over 2,600 Yuan Received in Continued Donations

Since the second phase of the scholarship campaign for Shen Bao readers began yesterday, there has been a warm response from all sectors, and donors continue to come one after another. The staff of this newspaper are deeply moved by this enthusiastic and benevolent spirit. It is expected that the amount raised in this phase of the scholarship will exceed the record of the previous phase, which is fortunate for the poor students.

Anonymous Elderly Man Adds Scholarship Slots

The anonymous elderly man who is most concerned about the scholarship wrote yesterday, "I wonder if the Readers' Scholarship was able to balance its budget last semester. Time flies, and the winter vacation is approaching in an instant. I suppose preparations are being made for the next phase. When I was at your newspaper last time, I mentioned that it might be possible to add a first-grade primary school group in the next semester, with a limit of 100 students, so that the children of cart pushers, maids, coolies, and laborers can all attend school. After two or three years, they would be able to recognize a little bit of writing and read newspapers, which may be beneficial to the world and people's hearts. I will bear the cost. I wonder if this can be adopted. As for the continued assistance for this phase, I will send it immediately."

Perfecting Measures, Still Under Discussion

This newspaper is very sympathetic to the elderly man's proposal. The original scholarship regulations stipulate that "primary schools must be at the end of the fourth grade before they can request assistance." The main purpose is that if children who have not been to school are allowed to apply, it will be difficult for applicants to fill out registration forms, and it will be even more difficult to assess their grades without standards. With the enthusiastic scholarship support from all sectors, and the willingness to treat all uneducated children equally and provide assistance, the staff are mindful that every cent and penny of donations is contributed by people from all walks of life who are tightening their belts. It is imperative that the donations are solemnly distributed based on academic performance. This is the newspaper's humble intention and purpose. Now, after reading the letter from the elderly man, which expresses the spirit of "treating all as brothers" and cherishing the desire to eliminate illiteracy, the goal is to enable these children who cannot afford to go to school to have the same opportunity to read and write. We deeply admire his benevolent intentions and righteous deeds. Now, after careful consideration, it is proposed to designate several well-run primary schools in the two concessions, allocate them according to the number of places donated by the elderly man, and introduce the children who cannot afford to attend primary school to enroll in the first grade of these designated primary schools. If the elderly man agrees with this principle, detailed measures will be discussed further and implemented soon.

Over 2,000 Yuan Received in Continued Donations

Mr. Xu Caicheng (Funeral gifts from friends and relatives) 1,000 yuan, Daqian Boxing Society 1,000 yuan, Mr. Wu Yonggang 192 yuan, Bingji 100 yuan, Zhengfang 100 yuan, Ge Dawei 100 yuan, Yizhi Society 34.5 yuan, Shen Fengbiao of Continental Hotel (monthly donation for this month) 20 yuan, Mr. Wu Tianqiu 19 yuan, Private Zide Elementary School senior and junior classmates (17.15 yuan, Yongji 16.11 yuan, Wushuang (manuscript fee) 10 yuan, Zhang Liu (manuscript fee) 8 yuan, Bai Mei (manuscript fee) 7 yuan, Xin Si Mutual Aid Society anonymous, Mrs. Pu Qiting, Pu Qiting, Ms. Pu Zouyunyu etc. 5 yuan each, Mr. Wu Weisheng 4 yuan, Zifang (manuscript fee) 3 yuan, Ni Cheng (lost and found) 3 yuan, Mr. Wu Zhengxin 2 yuan, Mrs. Yang 2 yuan, also Yang Shouzhen, Chen Yang Hepu Fukang, Pu Jieyuan, Miss Pu Weiying, Miss Pu Peiying, maid Hua Ma 1 yuan each, totaling 2,669.76 yuan. 33,277.33 yuan accumulated from the previous session (excluding those who have been paid), totaling 35,947.09 yuan.

### Tuberculosis Prevention Movement: Fundraising Proceeding Smoothly, Total Reaching 100,000 Yuan

### A Group on Burkill Road Robbed of a Large Sum

Yesterday at 12:50 PM, on Burkill Road, a pedestrian was riding in a rickshaw when, somehow, four robbers discovered that he was carrying a large sum of money. They immediately jumped out and robbed him. As a result, the man's cash of 45,000 yuan was entirely robbed, and the robbers escaped without a trace.

Around 11:00 AM yesterday, three thieves broke into 517 Avenue Road. One brandished a pistol and robbed the place of ornaments and cash before fleeing. After the victim called the police, a constable arrived and apprehended one thief. He was taken to the police station for interrogation.

The driver of the accident was taken to the police station for investigation.

Yesterday at about 4:00 PM, a girl named Shen Maomao, eight years old, was getting off a trolleybus at the Xinzha Road and Mackinnon Road stop. The child suddenly fell off the bus, and her left leg was severely crushed by the wheels. A constable summoned a vehicle to take her to the hospital for treatment. However, another report said that the ticket seller was in a hurry to ring the bell and start the bus, and the child, being young and unable to stand firmly, fell to the ground.

### Burkill Road Robbery-Murder Case: Another Accomplice Apprehended; Yesterday, the Arrested Suspects Were Sent to Court for Interrogation; Family Members of the Victim Arrived to Testify About the Incident

Tang Baoshan, an ophthalmologist from Guangdong, 38 years old, lived at No. 17, Dengxian Lane, Lane 344, Burkill Road. At 3:30 PM on the 20th, four robbers broke in. Two of them held pistols and threatened them not to make any noise. They robbed Tang of a ring, his sister Bao Tangshi of a diamond ring, his tenant Madam Wang Shao's two gold rings, and Xie Xushi's pair of glasses. At that moment, Tang Baoshan took the opportunity to strike one of the robbers on the head with a stool. The robber, named Xia Baosheng, was injured in the head and became enraged. He drew his pistol and fired four shots, hitting Tang in the left chest and left arm. He then called out to his accomplices and fled. At that time, patrolling constables also gathered after hearing the alarm. The robber Xia fled to the Baoxing Road intersection and was captured. Another robber, named Wang A'gen, from Tongzhou, 32 years old, fled into Tongchunfang on Burkill Road. Constables Nos. 2425 and others chased him. Wang drew his gun and resisted arrest. The police returned fire, and Wang was shot four times and fell to the ground. He was captured, and a pistol, without bullets, was seized. At that time, stray bullets injured Wu Nonghua's seven-year-old daughter, Wu Xiangzhen, who lived in Tongchunfang, and a passing woman, Zhao Lishi. Later, lawyer Wang Yaotang telegraphed the Xinzha Police Station to send detectives Wang Qishan and Yang Peizhang to investigate. At the victim Tang Baoshan's home, they found a Mauser pistol, four shell casings, and two bullets. They also transported the injured to the hospital separately. Tang Baoshan died soon after due to the severity of his injuries. The injured robber Wang A'gen was sent to the police hospital and died at 4:00 AM yesterday due to the severity of his injuries. His body was sent to the morgue for examination. The arrested robber Xia Baosheng was taken to the police station. Afterwards, another accomplice, He Yufu from Jiangbei, was arrested at No. 121 Mettian Road in the French Concession and taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested a postponement. Subsequently, witnesses Bao Tangshi, Wang Shao's, and Xie Xushi submitted statements proving the robbery and pointed out that Xia Baosheng was holding a pistol at the time. When questioned, Xia confessed to the robbery and admitted to shooting Tang to death. He Yufu's testimony was evasive. The judge ordered them to be detained pending a post-mortem examination of the body.

### Two Gangs of Thieves: Accomplices in Multiple Cases, Tried and Awaiting Judgment

Notorious thieves Zhou Zhuliang, Shen Haiqing, Shen Guifan, and Chen Wenlong, all from Jiangbei, along with a leader still at large, met at 1:30 AM on October 16 in Room 420 of the Dahua Hotel on Tibet Road to plan a robbery of the hotel's accounts room. The case was discovered, and they were arrested by Chinese detectives Wang Runhe, Zhang Fafu, and Yang Chengjie of the Xinzha Police Station. A Mauser pistol, an automatic pistol, and 15 bullets were seized. They were sent to the First Special District Court, and the case was postponed. An investigation revealed that these people were accomplices of a large-scale organized gang of thieves. They were interrogated and detained separately. Yesterday morning, the police stations jointly sent the ten suspects to the Third Criminal Court for trial. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case, filed a public prosecution for the crime of large-scale gang robbery, and stated that during the postponement, the investigation revealed that between December of last year and September of this year, the defendants had successively used weapons to rob the China Can Factory at No. 389 Maibai Road, a foreigner at No. 105 Jiangxi Road, a Race Course Road guest, Madam Chen Wangshi at No. 269 Xinzha Road, pedestrians Xu Xuemin and Xi Bingsheng on Mackinnon Road and Changping Road, and Huang Zhuan at No. 460 Dixiwei Road of over 40,000 yuan, and requested severe punishment. Judge Huang questioned each defendant separately and ordered them to be returned to custody to await sentencing.

### Rickshaw Puller's Commendable Benevolence: Employer's Three Pieces of Cargo Lost En Route, Seeking Owner

To the esteemed Editor:

Greetings. I am writing to inform you that a rickshaw puller named Li Changming picked up a passenger arriving in Shanghai from his hometown at Pier No. 5 on the Bund at 7:00 PM on November 19. The passenger asked him to load three pieces of cargo (one basket of Chinese cabbage, one bag of peanuts) and pull them to Nanyang Bridge Jialu Road in the French Concession. He then walked alongside the rickshaw. Unexpectedly, halfway there, he noticed that the passenger was gone. He then pulled the rickshaw to the destination to wait, but the person never arrived. So he sent the cargo to the Songshan Road Police Station for record. The passenger seems to be a poor villager. If he loses his goods, he will definitely be upset, or even mistakenly blame the rickshaw puller. For this reason, I am entrusting your esteemed newspaper to publish this information. I hope the owner will come to my place at No. 730, Edward Road, and invite the rickshaw puller to go to the police station together to identify the goods. Thank you for your trouble. Sincerely, Yang Jianwen. November 21st. Address: No. 730 Edward Road. Phone: 92916.

### Fan Shaoyun and Son's Painting Notice

Wu Douming painter Fan Shaoyun's works deeply capture the essence of the Four Wangs, differing greatly from the masses. His brilliant son Boyan, deeply rooted in family learning and inherited the mantle of his father, gallops in the art world, also gaining a reputation throughout the country. Recently, due to the overwhelming number of requests for his father's paintings, he has temporarily stopped accepting them starting from the first of this month.

### Hitler's Military Advisor

— He Kai

In the past two years and several months, Germany has often been able to attack the weakest point of the opponent's defense line in Poland, Northern Europe, Belgium, France, the Balkans, and the Soviet Union, achieving lightning victories. Before each military operation, political and economic preparations are always carried out, complementing each other, resulting in great effectiveness. This unprecedented strategic and political success is said to be due to the strength of Hitler alone.

However, in fact, there is someone else behind Hitler, planning strategies for him. That is Dr. Karl Haushofer. The Munich "Geopolitics Association" under his command has over a thousand well-known scientists who are constantly studying Germany's strategies for dominating the world, and this group is, in fact, Hitler's military advisor.

It is unprecedented in history for a head of state to have such a research institution. Whether it is Ribbentrop's diplomatic apparatus, Himmler's secret police, Goebbels' propaganda department, or Brauchitsch's Wehrmacht, it can be said that they are all to some extent under Haushofer's command.

In 1938, when Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the German General Staff was deeply afraid that if the German army entered Czechoslovakia, France would immediately send troops to rescue them, but Haushofer determined that this was an overestimation, and the fact proved that this was indeed the case.

It was Haushofer who predicted that Poland could be conquered in 18 days, and it was also Haushofer who, regarding Brauchitsch's commander-in-chief's concern that the German mechanized forces would be troubled by the Polish wetlands, stated that an attack would be launched at an appropriate time to avoid rain.

During the landing operation in Norway, the German High Command felt quite uneasy, but Haushofer guaranteed that it would be successful.

When attacking France, Hitler accepted Haushofer's advice, stopped the German High Command's proposal to launch a swift attack, and waited for the opportunity to mature, eventually achieving an unprecedented victory. Subsequently, the dispatch of troops to North Africa, the Balkans, and the Soviet Union was undoubtedly based on Haushofer's advice.

Hitler is merely a demagogue, not a politician with a well-thought-out plan, nor a naturally gifted hero. Most of his world policies are due to Haushofer, and it is said that Chapter 16 of "Mein Kampf" regarding foreign policy was also written by Haushofer.

Haushofer was an army officer of the German Empire. During the First World War, he had been promoted to the rank of major general. After the war, he retired from the military and served as a professor at the University of Munich, lecturing on geopolitics, strongly advocating the inevitability of Germany's revival, which was supported by general students.

He and Hitler met about seventeen years ago, when the latter launched a coup in Munich, suffered a failure, and was imprisoned. At that time, he often visited Hitler.

After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Hitler immediately asked Haushofer to organize the "Geopolitics Association," which was an organization not subject to the interference of the military or the control of the party headquarters, and was empowered to obtain all information from the government's propaganda department, diplomatic apparatus, and secret police. Under Haushofer's command, over a thousand economists, psychologists, geographers, strategists, historians, and other experts engaged in investigation and research.

### Farewell! U.S. Marine Corps

— Yangtze River

The U.S. troops stationed in China have been ordered to withdraw, and the Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps in Shanghai is also bidding farewell. "Goodbye, Shanghai." When the U.S. military returns to the new China in the future, they will surely be invited as honored guests and receive a warm welcome. Today, we reluctantly bid farewell and send off the Fourth Regiment on their journey. The more tense the situation in the Pacific, the more dangerous the waves, the greater the responsibility of the journey. Farewell! U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment.

In 1853 (the third year of Xianfeng), during the Small Swords Society uprising, and in 1860 (the tenth year of Xianfeng), when the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom army approached Shanghai, the U.S. government successively sent troops to be stationed in Shanghai; after the signing of the treaty in Gengzi (the 26th year of Guangxu), the U.S. Department of War dispatched 500 Marines to be stationed in Tianjin and Peking.

The U.S. Marine Corps has been established for 166 years. The Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai was established on April 16, 1914, and has only 26 years of history. At first, it was stationed in Mexico and Santo Domingo, and it was not until 1927 that it was ordered to be transferred to China, arriving in Shanghai on a giant transport ship on February 24 of that year. At that time, it belonged to the Third Brigade of the Marine Corps, with the brigade headquarters located in Tianjin. On January 29, 1929, the Third Brigade was ordered to be disbanded. Except for the Fourth Regiment, the rest of the officers and soldiers of the U.S. military brigades returned to the United States in February of the following year. The Fourth Regiment was formed by the merger of two battalions. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war in 1937, at the request of the authorities of the Public Concession, the Second Brigade of the U.S. Marine Corps came to Shanghai in December to increase defenses. On February 18 of the following year, the Second Brigade, together with the Sixth Regiment and the anti-aircraft artillery unit, withdrew from China, leaving only the Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai.

The U.S. Yangtze River Fleet continues to be stationed, with the flagship Luzon (575 tons) currently moored in the middle of the Huangpu River at the British naval pontoon, and the Wake (450 tons) patrolling the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Tutuila (370 tons) is along the Chongqing riverbank. They will continue to be responsible for protecting U.S. citizens and property.

Farewell! U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment, today we bid farewell to your departure from Shanghai, and we hope to warmly welcome you in the future, when you are invited to China to visit the new China!

Life

### Labor Under the Swastika

— Miao Yong

In the Middle Ages, serfs were part of the landlord's property, bound to the land and unable to leave. The situation of German workers today is similar to that of serfs in the Middle Ages, except that they are bound to their jobs rather than to the land.

In 1937, tens of thousands of young clerks were driven out of offices and into farms, highways, and factories to sell their labor. Countless workers were driven back and forth in this way. Without government permission, workers could not resign, and employers could not dismiss workers. However, the government had the power to summon any worker to leave their original job without the employer's consent and send them to another place to work.

At first, the Nazis forced traveling salesmen to work in the fields and factories; in 1938 and 1939, they began to use artisans, and 500,000 shops closed, and all employees joined the so-called Labor Front.

The lives of German workers have been completely militarized. Wages are legally fixed, and demanding higher wages is enough to incur severe punishment. Long working hours are also legally fixed and cannot be shortened. Vacations, membership, and leisure are all controlled by the Nazis. If a worker quits halfway, the authorities have the right to force them back - just as a feudal lord has the right to force a serf back.

Ancient feudal lords had the right to kill serfs. Under Nazi rule, every worker has a labor passport, which details the holder's training, abilities, and occupation. It is illegal to employ a worker without this passport. Therefore, if an employer reclaims the passport of a worker they consider reactionary, it is enough to starve them to death.

Forcing teenagers to work is also a kind of "virtuous policy" of Hitler. Since March 1938, the Nazis have ordered households across the country to report the names of children who have completed primary school to the responsible authorities. Schools also have special personnel responsible for assigning children to places that need child labor. Most of these children are only fourteen years old. Under private serfdom, only serfs give birth to serfs; under Nazi rule, every woman is a producer of slaves.

Under this inhumane control, there are more than 20 million workers living in a dark world. But who dares to say that they will never roar?

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

14. Living the Life of a Hero

"It doesn't matter, it will slowly get better in a few days!" Begonia always answered like this. "Listen, the sound of artillery is getting louder day by day. People who escaped from over there haven't even had a quick meal. We're still thinking about taking medicine? Meibao, a cough is a minor illness, you don't need to worry about me!"

In China, people without medical knowledge generally think that a cough is the flu, until the coughing lasts too long and the patient's spirit weakens day by day, everyone says "this is tuberculosis;" at first, no one pays attention at all.

Now, Begonia has also made this mistake. Although he feels very tired when he coughs, and his body temperature seems to be higher than usual, these are symptoms that he has never experienced when coughing from a cold before; but due to the pressure of life and economic difficulties, he really doesn't dare to rashly step into the big door of a doctor's house.

For the past few days, he has always been holding a piece of rock sugar in his mouth, because only this method can make his coughing a little better.

This evening, after he asked Zhang Yincai for leave and was not approved, he reluctantly dragged his tired body, walking step by step along Changbang Road; when he was about to reach a corner, suddenly two people came face to face, fighting and chasing all the way, neither of them paying attention to him, by the time he wanted to avoid it was already too late."

### Foot-Powered Saw

— Yong Yun

Sawing has always been a very strenuous task, but now there is a foot-powered saw. When sawing, you only need to step on it with your foot, as easily as playing a piano. It is a machine called a counter-hammer that makes the sawing pressure generated by each footstep equal. This new tool is very simple and can be installed on a workbench with little effort, and any size and any form of saw can be applied. There will be no danger when installing and dismantling the saw.

### Stomach Disease Scriptures

Judging the Quality of Stomach Medicine. Any stomach medicine that, after being taken continuously for half a month, shows no improvement and the dosage needs to be increased can be determined to be absolutely difficult to cure stomach diseases and may even worsen them. Conversely, any medicine that, after being taken continuously for half a month, shows complete or partial healing and allows the dosage to be gradually reduced, can be trusted to cure the stomach disease. There are many stomach medicines on the market, but only "Chubing" allows the dosage to be gradually reduced and even eradicate the disease and restore health.

Treating Stomach Disease Requires Treating Stomach Ulcers. The root of chronic stomach disease lies in stomach ulcers. Stomach medicines containing anesthetics, baking soda, or calcium-magnesium substances can absolutely not cure stomach ulcers, and therefore can never cure chronic stomach disease. "Chubing" is a newly invented aluminum compound that can effectively and quickly heal stomach ulcers, and therefore can cure chronic stomach disease. Stopping stomach pain is secondary.

"Chubing" Overwhelms Famous Foreign Medicines. It has often been heard that chronic stomach disease sufferers have taken foreign stomach medicines for many years without any improvement in their condition, or even worsening it. However, after taking "Chubing" for a month, they report that the disease has been completely eradicated and health has been restored! Furthermore, according to reports from many doctors, the effectiveness of "Chubing" in curing stomach diseases has indeed exceeded all expensive stomach medicines from the East and West. Other low-grade medicines are not worth mentioning. This is truly good news for stomach disease sufferers and an honor for the domestic industry. Produced by Tianping Pharmaceutical Factory.

### Discussing the Fate of "Confucius"

— Zhou Jintao

"Confucius," which had a fleeting run in Shanghai, is now scheduled for a re-release. The director of "Confucius" is Mr. Fei Mu. Mr. Fei's directorial achievements are quite reputable. According to the information in the special issue on "Confucius," it is known that the director and production team put in a great deal of effort. Logically, a film produced with such great effort and with special promotion, and whose material and main character are the most revered teacher of China, Confucius, known both at home and abroad, should have been a box office hit and welcomed everywhere. However, unexpected things often happen in Shanghai. It was shown at the Jincheng Cinema for only a short time before being replaced. And it took almost a year before it was re-released in Shanghai. Confucius only served as Prime Minister of Lu for three months before being forced to leave Shandong. Thousands of years later, when filmed, he was rejected by Shanghai in less than half a month. Is his fate destined to be so? Writing this, I cannot help but lament for the most revered teacher!

The reason why "Confucius" failed to be a box office success is: a lack of connection. But this cannot be entirely blamed on the screenwriter's skills, simply because Confucius's life was one of constant movement, lacking stability. He spent much time traveling among the various states, sometimes not even staying a week before moving on. Another reason is that the film uses literary Chinese sentences from books like the Analects. I presume the screenwriter's intention was to avoid losing the original meaning and tone by translating it into vernacular Chinese. This inevitably overlooks the audience's literary cultivation. A remedy would be to add subtitles to the film, like the Chinese subtitles added to Western films, so that if viewers cannot hear clearly, they can read the added subtitles. In all fairness, this film is worth watching. Especially in these times and places where black and white are indistinguishable, right and wrong are confused, and righteousness is waning. What is most pitiful is the Shanghai audience. Some are too naive. They not only cannot understand domestic art films, but they also have no interest in Western art or biographical films.

I remember once when "The Eternal Teacher" was released in Shanghai, those with more education were so moved that they even shed tears, considering it valuable and meaningful. However, a large portion of the "gentlemen" and "ladies" found it incomprehensible, and the box office was not strong, naturally shortening the run. To be frank and blunt, I suspect that among the "gentlemen" and "ladies" who go to first-run theaters to watch Western films, perhaps only 30 to 40 percent can fully understand English. The other 50 to 60 percent just go to join the crowd, sit for two hours, and then, upon emerging, boast in social circles that they have seen such-and-such a film. My point is that film producers and cinemas should not always prioritize money. They must also bear some responsibility for educating the public and the audience. A film studio should produce at least one relatively profound and educational film every two years; a cinema should show at least two films each year that are not very profitable but have educational value for the audience. In this way, the audience's perspective can be gradually elevated, achieving the ultimate goal of entertainment without forgetting education.

Furthermore, the Central Propaganda Department should reward films of this kind, both materially and in terms of honor. I believe that if this film "Confucius" can receive an award from the Central Propaganda Department, the Shanghai audience, who were not satisfied the last time, will flock to see it again with a different pair of "glasses."

### Mei Lanfang to Bring Red Carpet on Train

According to reliable sources, Mei Lanfang has been residing in Hong Kong for several years. His wife, Ms. Fu Zhifang, only returned to Shanghai this summer. Mr. Mei was previously invited by gentry and merchants in Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and other places to perform in charity shows to help those suffering from the winter cold. He has now reportedly agreed and is preparing to travel to the Southwest to perform as requested. This is provisionally recorded pending verification.

### Review of "The True Story of Ah Q"

— Jin Ge

Ah Q, this typical character representing ignorance in feudal rural society, was deeply depicted by Mr. Lu Xun, who shouted loudly, both pitying Ah Q's unconscious sacrifice and hoping that the Ah Q within everyone's consciousness would die!

Ah Q has been dead for many years, and even Mr. Lu Xun, the one who depicted Ah Q, has passed away for five years. However, Ah Q's shadow, Ah Q's psychology, is still spreading throughout every social stratum. The feudal autocratic system has not been fundamentally destroyed; in some places, it has even become more deeply rooted. How many people like Ah Q are unknowingly and unconsciously sacrificed and devoured! Therefore, the revival of "The True Story of Ah Q" today is of profound significance.

This time, the fifth act is different from the original work by Chen Yu, the adapter. However, the entire play is most powerful precisely because of this different fifth act. The young master Qian and the old master Zhao use tricks and easily kill Ah Q, using a pretext that is so cunning. At the same time, it not only exposes the despicable intentions of the young master Qian but also highlights the selfish plans of the old master Zhao. The criticism of the faces of that group of people could not be more profound.

In addition, new techniques have been used in the set design, props, and lighting for this revival. In the final act, the director handles the crowd scene in a lively and vivid manner. The part where Ah Q dances before being paraded through the streets and suddenly realizes that his handcuffs have not been unlocked has the power to control the audience's emotions and move them.

### Random Notes from the Pear Garden

— Cunren

The veteran actor and martial artist Shang Heyu was invited to the Golden Front Theater before, but the invitation did not materialize. Now, there are renewed discussions about inviting him. It is said that Li Shifang, the leading of the Four Little Famous Dan, and Xiao Changhua and others may arrive in Shanghai in February next year to perform at the theater, following Ma Lianliang and Li Yuru.

The two actors Wang Hongfu and Wang Yingwu were recently invited to the same stage, but Hongfu is being considered for retention by the Tianchan Theater, and Yingwu is being treated for an arm injury sustained during practice, so both are postponing their commitments.

Han Suqiu will no longer perform in troupes this year. It is said that someone is raising funds to rebuild a new theater in Suzhou, and they have invited Suqiu to perform there next spring.

Huang Guiqiu has been hired by a theater in Nanjing and will perform there after her current contract expires.

It is said that Guan Dayuan encountered danger on his way back this time. While passing through Xuzhou, several trains ahead of his were overturned. Although he was fortunate enough to escape unharmed, he was greatly frightened, which delayed his arrival in Shanghai by one day.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Yimingdao

Chapter 19: Dusk, Tartar Cavalry, City Covered in Dust

Seeing that Liu Zongmin and others could not defeat the Ming generals, and that his own side had lost Fan Damazi, Li Chuang could not help but be secretly alarmed. He thought that Wu Sangui's subordinates were all brave and skilled. Niu Quanxing said to Li Zicheng at the side: "Your Majesty, you see that Sangui's subordinates have many capable people. If we fight them today, we may suffer losses. Fortunately, we have more soldiers. Please order the entire army to attack, charge forward, and engage them in a melee. With our superior numbers, they will naturally be unable to resist." Li Zicheng also agreed with this idea, so he ordered the drums of advance to be sounded in the army again. The bandit rebels all moved forward together, horses galloping and soldiers running, filling the mountains and plains. They divided into several large groups and charged towards Sangui's formation. In an instant, Zhang Cangqiu, Xu Jing, and others were surrounded by the bandit rebels. Sangui also led his troops to meet the enemy, and the two sides engaged in a chaotic battle. The number of bandit rebels only continued to increase, and their momentum was great. On the Qing army's side, the Regent Prince Dorgon, along with Ajige, Dodo, Hong Chengchou, Kong Youde, Shang Kexi, and others, all stood on horseback on a high hill, watching the battle. Initially, they saw the Ming generals under Wu Sangui's command continuously斩kill several贼bandits, their attacks were fierce, and they were greatly amazed. Later, they saw the bandit rebels using their superior numbers to open their wings and surround the Ming army, like a tidal wave. The Ming soldiers fought fiercely, charging and grappling, and the sound of shouting and killing shook the sea. The time was already approaching noon, dust and sand rose from the mountains, raging like thunder. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, and the corpses piled up like mountains. Dorgon turned to look at Dodo and said: "Now we can go out and defeat the bandits." He ordered the cavalry of the Solon tribe to charge first. The warriors of the Solon tribe were the bravest troops among the Manchu tribes, skilled in horsemanship, and especially proficient in firearms and bows and arrows. In every battle, the Qing army assigned the Solon tribe the responsibility of capturing strongholds, and they could be called elite. At that time, the sound of drums shook greatly, and the Qing army suddenly emerged from the right of Sangui's formation. Ten thousand horses galloped, flying arrows fell like rain, and the firearms sounded loudly, like thunder. Wherever they went, nothing could stand against them.
