### "June 3rd" Opium Prohibition Commemoration Meeting: Full Text of Chiang Kai-shek's Address: Successful Implementation of the Six-Year Plan Makes the Opium Prohibition of Great Significance; With the Spirit of Thoroughly Eliminating Evil, We Should Completely Eradicate the Remaining Poison

Chongqing On the 2nd, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued the full text of his address to the "June 3rd" Opium Prohibition Commemoration Meeting: "This year's June 3rd Opium Prohibition Commemoration is held after the completion of the government's six-year opium prohibition plan and the implementation of absolute prohibition, which makes it particularly significant. National construction requires relieving the people and bringing them peace, and regaining our national pride and seeking strength especially depends on a strong determination. If we are slightly negligent and allow the remnants to revive, it will not only bring disgrace to our nation but also fail our heavenly duty. I sincerely hope that all party, government, and military personnel at all levels, local gentry, and compatriots across the country will uphold the determination to thoroughly eliminate evil and the responsibility of every citizen to defend the country. We must continue to eradicate the hidden and dormant remnants to achieve fundamental eradication. We should also fight vigorously to thoroughly eliminate the policy of poisoning the people and ensure that the solemn territory of China will never again have the existence of poisonous seedlings and evil weeds, and that the descendants of the Chinese nation will become new people with strong bodies and minds, promoting the cause of our ancestors and leading the nation to revival. We have great expectations for everyone to work together." (Dispatch of the 2nd)

Guiyang Today is the "June 3rd" Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day. The Provincial Mobilization Committee, considering that Guizhou Province has suffered from opium poisoning for decades and this year marks the deadline for absolute prohibition, has launched a grand commemoration throughout the province. The atmosphere in Guiyang is particularly enthusiastic. The conference was held in the afternoon, presided over by Wu Dingchang, who reported, stating briefly: (1) The greatest reason for the prosperity of Guizhou Province in recent years is the opium prohibition. (2) President Chiang followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions and implemented the Party's policies. At a time when the country is at war and facing extreme financial difficulties, he did not hesitate to sacrifice 70 million yuan in annual tax revenue in Guizhou Province alone to thoroughly eliminate opium poisoning. His painstaking efforts for the country and the people are truly moving. If we do not immediately quit, how can we be considered human? (3) From now on, either there will be Guizhou without opium, or there will be opium without Guizhou. Huang Shouru and Tan Kemin then delivered speeches, passing a resolution to send a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang before adjourning the meeting. The Pacification Headquarters also approved the execution of 28 opium offenders in the city and various counties today, including 18 people who operated opium dens, 5 people who cultivated opium, 2 people who relapsed, and 3 people who transported opium.

Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing: Downtown Area Suffers

According to various sources in Chongqing, the casualties from yesterday's Japanese air raid were higher than any other this year. There are many factors for this, and it is difficult to explain in a few words. Many bombs were dropped in the densely populated area on the north bank of the Jialing River, opposite Chongqing, causing many casualties. Several bombs landed near the YMCA, and its affiliated cinema was destroyed. A bomb also landed in front of the Xinmin Daily, damaging the wall. (Reuters, 3rd)

Yesterday, the Civil Court of Chongqing heard a case in which a Chinese landlord accused his German tenant, Van Lato, of causing his house to be bombed. The landlord claimed that during air raid alerts, the German tenant would hang the flag of the German Nazi Party on the roof, and Japanese aircraft would repeatedly bomb the area around the house. The court stated that the case should be transferred to the Air Defense Headquarters, but before a ruling could be made, an air raid alert suddenly occurred, and everyone fled to the air raid shelters.

### The New Situation in the Eastern Mediterranean

Crete, one of the three cornerstones of the British defense triangle in the Eastern Mediterranean, has now been officially declared fallen. When the Italo-Greek war broke out last November, Britain, in order to ensure its lifeline in the Eastern Mediterranean, aided Greece with land and air forces to resist the Italian advance southward. Simultaneously, Britain launched an offensive against the Italian Empire in Africa. Subsequently, with repeated naval victories against the Italian fleet, Britain occupied Crete in one fell swoop. Thus, Cyprus to the east, the Alexandria naval port to the south, plus the newly occupied Crete, formed a tripod, shielding the Suez Canal, as well as the Near East, the Middle East, and Africa.

However, the situation shifted. After Germany and Italy occupied the entire Balkan Peninsula, they continued to advance, aiming to dismantle the British Empire by occupying Arabia via Turkey and Syria. This would allow them to strike the rear of the Suez Canal and extend the war to the Middle East, forcing British forces to rapidly withdraw from the Eastern Mediterranean. Therefore, when the Anglo-Iraqi conflict erupted a month ago, the world's attention was focused on Turkey and Syria, holding its breath for Britain's defense of the Middle East, even its outer defenses of India. Strictly speaking, the sudden outbreak of the Battle of Crete was somewhat unexpected and comparatively favorable to Britain. Its significance lies in: First, it demonstrated Turkey's firm stance against the German and Italian proposal to pass through and partition the Near East and Middle East. Second, although international developments may still present sudden twists, logically, Germany and Italy's determination to occupy Crete at any cost may aim beyond merely shaking British hegemony in the Eastern Mediterranean. They may be attempting to open a new route from Crete to Cyprus to French-held Syria, extending into the Middle East while striving to avoid infringing upon Turkish territory to prevent possible friction with Turkey and Syria. If this is the case, it is indeed of great significance.

According to dispatches from around the world over the past two days, Germany and Italy's future target in the Eastern Mediterranean is largely the British-held Cyprus. Therefore, two points are worth concerning: (1) What will be the success or failure of the German-Italian offensive on Cyprus? (2) How will it affect the overall war situation?

To understand the first point, we must first consider the experience of the Battle of Crete. In terms of area, Cyprus is the third largest island in the Mediterranean after Sicily and Sardinia, so its support capabilities for the defending forces are greater than Crete. In terms of location, it is closer to the British air force bases in Egypt and Palestine than Crete, while further away from the German air force bases in mainland Greece. Therefore, the overwhelming air superiority that Germany and Italy enjoyed in Crete may not be replicated over Cyprus. In terms of military preparedness, it is the largest British naval and air force base other than Malta, and certainly not comparable to Crete, which Britain and Greece hastily defended. These are the differences between it and Crete. However, the most fundamental point is that it is also an island isolated in the sea, so the only possible way for Germany and Italy to attack Cyprus is to concentrate their forces and conduct a blitz from the air. The overwhelming air superiority of the German and Italian air forces, based on the experience of the Battle of Crete, forced the British to abandon it. The British army also never sent large-scale reinforcements, which ultimately doomed its fate. Shortly after the start of the Battle of Crete, Britain announced the withdrawal of its air force, and by the end, 15,000 British troops had also withdrawn voluntarily. This, compared to Germany and Italy's willingness to attack at any cost, shows that Britain did not have the determination to defend with all its strength. Of course, the final success or failure of this European war on both sides may ultimately be determined by resources and economy, and military advances and retreats are secondary, let alone the loss of a foothold? In the past, Britain withdrew its troops four times under similar circumstances: from Norway, Dunkirk, Italian Somaliland, and the Balkans. The abandonment of Crete is the fifth time. Therefore, in the event that Germany and Italy launch an all-out attack on Cyprus, whether Britain has the preparation and actions to concentrate its forces and engage in a decisive battle will be the most critical factor in determining victory or defeat there. In addition, it should be pointed out that after the heavy sacrifices in the Battle of Crete, the intensity of the future attack on Cyprus by Germany and Italy will inevitably be reduced to a considerable extent.

In the event of a war in Cyprus, the entire Middle East, the Eastern Mediterranean, and even Africa will experience a very fierce battle. On the German and Italian side, its left wing will start from the Balkans via Crete and attempt to occupy Cyprus and Syria, advancing directly towards Suez and the Red Sea. Its right wing will pass through Italian-held Libya in Africa and attempt to break through Egypt and reach Suez. This is nothing less than a huge so-called "pincer movement," attempting to dismantle the British Empire's power in this area. On the British side, it now has two most favorable points: First, Italy's power in Abyssinia has been almost completely wiped out. Second, the anti-British faction in Iraq has been largely eliminated. These are the most reassuring things for Britain at the moment, and they form the most prerequisite conditions for Britain to engage in any effective resistance in this area. Therefore, from the perspective of the overall war situation, the stability of the two rear areas of Abyssinia and Iraq is much more important to Britain than the gains and losses of Crete.

Finally, there is another question: What will be the position of British-held Malta, which lies on the German and Italian right wing, in the future battle? Whether Germany and Italy will launch a simultaneous blitz on it will be answered by future events.

### U.S. to Form Special Task Force: Prepares to Implement Atlantic Escort; Unlimited Appointment of Navy Vice Admirals Bill Passes House: Prelude to Large-Scale Cooperation Between British and American Navies

Washington The House of Representatives yesterday passed a bill requested by the government, authorizing Roosevelt to appoint special naval vice admirals for "special or extraordinary" naval duties that cannot be explained. The bill did not limit the number of naval vice admirals. The House also sent the bill, which had already been passed, to the Senate. Acting Secretary of the Navy, Bader, wrote to the House stating, "The goal of this bill is to allow the President to simply assign any naval officer to perform special duties or command any naval fleet and organize fleets to carry out special or extraordinary matters, so that they can obtain the title, salary, and allowances of a formal naval vice admiral during their tenure." There has been speculation here that this move is intended to build a "special task force" within the Navy so that the United States can implement escorting for Britain in the Atlantic. Some believe that the bill is a prelude to increased cooperation between the British and American navies. The British Navy has many vice admirals, and any American naval officer who cooperates with British naval officers should have the same rank. (United Press, 3rd)

### U.S. Approves Priority Manufacturing for Military Orders from Democratic Nations

Hyde Park President Roosevelt signed a major mandatory priority manufacturing law last night, giving the government the power to restrict civilian industrial products. This move places the United States' massive production organizations under a wartime system. Previously, only products ordered under contracts signed by the Army and Navy had priority. Now, the government has the power to prioritize products ordered by various democratic countries and government agencies. Civilian essentials deemed urgent by national defense officials can also be given priority. This bill is one of the most drastic actions taken by the government, supplementing the President's recent declaration that the nation is in an unlimited emergency. (United Press, 3rd)

### Military Department Requests President to Be Granted Power to Requisition Industries Necessary for National Defense

Washington Senator Reynolds, Democratic Chairman of the Senate Army Committee, introduced a bill yesterday proposing to grant President Roosevelt wartime privileges, allowing him to requisition "property of any kind or nature," including factories, ships, patents, and tangible and intangible assets. Secretary of War Patterson wrote to House Speaker Rayburn, urging the passage of the bill. Rayburn immediately referred the bill to the House Army Committee. It is alleged that Congress may quickly pass it. The War Department stated that the bill had been approved by President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Knox, explaining that the bill would place all property under "requisition" and would authorize the President to take over armaments factories and patents necessary for important military supplies for any reason related to national defense. The President would also have the right to nationalize them. The President would also be able to requisition ships, docks, railroads, farms, and various other facilities. He could also sell the acquired property and rights under conditions he deems satisfactory. However, the U.S. government must pay "generous compensation" for the requisitioned property.

### Large Quantities of U.S. Military Supplies Will Be Transported to Chongqing Via Burma; Planned to Supply China with One Hundred Long-Range Bombers; American Aviation Personnel Already En Route; Ishii Believes U.S. Action Is Unfriendly to Japan

Tokyo "Miyako Shimbun" reported reliable sources from Washington, stating that the U.S. President Lines has dispatched a group of navigation experts to Rangoon to prepare for the transportation of large quantities of military supplies to Chongqing via the Burma Road. The report also cited sources in New York, stating that a large number of American pilots and aircraft are already at sea, being transported via Rangoon to Chongqing. The report also said that the United States plans to supply General Chiang Kai-shek with at least one hundred long-range bombers. These bombers will be equipped with American pilots and technicians who will fly these aircraft to Chinese bases deep inland. However, the American pilots and technicians will mainly participate in technical matters and will not participate in military operations. (Reuters, 3rd)

Ishii, a spokesman for the Tokyo Information Bureau, commented on news reports from Singapore, Shanghai, and other places, stating that some U.S. Army pilots are currently going to Chongqing to serve the Chinese government, saying that if this news is true, it is an unfriendly act towards Japan. The spokesman also said that the Japanese Consul General in Singapore stated that if this news is true, it is simply a waste of personnel and materials. This statement resonated with me. (Reuters, 3rd)

Tokyo The "Japan Times" and "Guangzhi Bao", both run by Japanese in Tokyo, commented on an editorial in the New York Times, stating that according to Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact, Japan would participate in the war if the United States went to war with Germany. They also stated that the New York Times had obviously not studied the Japanese Foreign Minister's statement in detail. Foreign Minister Matsuoka had made it clear that Japan would have to participate in the war in accordance with Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact after a German-U.S. war broke out, and this had been clearly stated to the American newspapers. The report also stated that Japan welcomed the United States to resolve its policy in the Pacific with a practical attitude. The so-called practical attitude meant abandoning interference in Japan's problems in China and the economic pressure it exerted on Japan, as these problems were prerequisites for a Japanese-American understanding.

### Philippine Copper Ore - Ban on Shipping to Japan - Philippine Export Controls - Seeking Simplification

Tokyo - According to a Japanese dispatch from Manila, U.S. State Department control subcommittee deputy leader Utz arrived in Manila yesterday and told reporters that the implementation of export controls will be simplified as much as possible to prevent serious obstruction of Philippine export trade. Meanwhile, the Manila Daily Bulletin reported that U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, under orders from the U.S. State Department, has rejected a request to ship copper ore to Japan.

### New Diplomatic Steps by the U.S. - Enhancing Sino-American Friendship - Another Clear Evidence - U.S.-Japan Relations Will Become More Tense - Guo Taiqi to Arrive in Manila Soon

Chongqing - It is learned that the newly appointed Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi will arrive in Manila within days, planning to change his route to Chongqing, bypassing Hong Kong, and instead going to Singapore and Yangon before arriving in Chongqing. Yesterday, local newspapers prominently published the exchange of letters between Guo Taiqi and U.S. Secretary of State Hull regarding the U.S.'s intention to relinquish consular jurisdiction in China when peace and order are restored, unanimously calling it another evidence of enhanced Sino-American friendship. (Reuters, 3rd)

The "Sweeping Newspaper" of the Army organs commented that "Only countries like China and the United States have the qualifications to speak of coexistence and co-prosperity." The newspaper also pointed out that the U.S. had previously recognized China's tariff autonomy and is now advocating the abandonment of special rights in China, truly symbolizing the close cooperation between these two major powers on the Pacific coast in the future. (United Press, 3rd)

Washington - Although American newspapers, due to more urgent events elsewhere in the world, did not all write editorials criticizing Secretary of State Hull's remarks about the future relinquishment of extraterritorial rights in China, they all considered it a step in the right direction and something that China deserves. Considering the long-term war of resistance, China has already established its independence. Hull's remarks are undoubtedly a major event in the history of Sino-American relations. The Republican "Baltimore Sun" stated that Hull's letter is something Japan should carefully consider. The letter is another amazing guarantee of American friendship and trust towards China, which will surely excite the Chinese government and people. Japan has recently repeatedly expressed its desire to achieve a certain resolution in Asia. This letter now gives Japan an opportunity to reconsider its position, as it should feel that it has presented principles and procedures upon which the U.S., China, and Japan can properly manage things. (Washington Star) believes that this is a diplomatic step that will intensify the tension between the U.S. and Japan. It is expected that new tensions in U.S.-Japan relations may not be far off. Hull's letter will satisfy China's sentiments, strengthen the position of the Chongqing government, and demonstrate the purity and selflessness of the ten-nation diplomatic goals in the Far East. At the same time, this letter is also a blow to Japan because it contradicts Japan's policy of aggression. After Hull issued this letter, the export control regulations were implemented in the Philippines, and Japan and the Dutch East Indies are in a tense situation due to failed negotiations. It is speculated that the overall situation may change within a few days. The strong stance of the Dutch East Indies towards Japan is probably due to the support of Britain and the United States.

### Dutch East Indies-Japan Negotiations - Indicate No Further Concessions - Japanese Proposals Have Not Been Replied To - Tokyo Newspapers Urge Government to Deal Sternly

Batavia - Recently, Japanese newspapers have been complaining that the Dutch East Indies is deliberately delaying its commercial negotiations with Japan. This move has only caused the Dutch East Indies to decide today to be even more unyielding in the negotiations. The Minister of Economic Affairs of the Dutch East Indies and chief negotiator with Japan, Mook, declared, "If the commercial and economic relationship is viewed by the Dutch East Indies as a belligerent and Japan as a neutral, then there will be no misunderstandings or disharmony." At the same time, the government is still strengthening its defenses and has authorized the accelerated conscription of the 1923 class of militia for basic training. Industrially, the Dutch East Indies has rapidly started new war industries and hopes to achieve self-sufficiency. (United Press, 3rd)

The spokesperson for the Tokyo Information Bureau stated while hosting news reporters today that the talks in Batavia have reached a critical stage, and we may receive a reply from the Dutch East Indies authorities to Japan's proposals in the near future. It is understood that the Japanese representative, Yoshizawa, submitted Japan's final proposals to the Dutch East Indies government on May 7th, but no reply has been received to date. (Reuters, 3rd)

Tokyo - "Miyako Shimbun" and "Hochi Shimbun" are both unable to tolerate the "hostile" attitude displayed by the authorities of the Dutch East Indies in their economic negotiations with Japan. They strongly urge the Japanese government to abandon its indecisive policy and begin to deal with Batavia with a stern plan. "Hochi Shimbun" advises the Dutch East Indies authorities to give solemn consideration to the final conditions that they received from Japan, stating that this decision is not just about the success or failure of the talks, but about the safety of the South Pacific. Both newspapers stated that the Dutch East Indies authorities' foolish stubbornness is due to the support of the United Kingdom and the United States, and they falsely believe that Britain will ultimately defeat the Axis powers. Miyako Shimbun also stated that the recent visits of Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens and Colonial Minister Welter to Batavia are also related to this, as the Dutch East Indies authorities' attitude towards Japan has become stronger since then.

Batavia - The local "Bode" newspaper published a special Chinese edition. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent a special telegram stating that the current position of the Dutch East Indies is not as exposed and isolated as it was six months ago. Other powers recognize the work they must participate in in the Pacific, and the Dutch East Indies authorities have ample opportunities to carry out practical national defense. The Foreign Minister of the National Government also telegraphed the newspaper, stating that China and the Dutch East Indies have always maintained a mutually beneficial relationship, which is based on the free promotion of both people and mutual respect between the two sides.

### U.S. Invents Typhoid Vaccine

Washington - Dr. Tom Parran, Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service, announced yesterday that the department under his jurisdiction had made special achievements last year, namely the invention of a "typhoid prevention vaccine." This vaccine is made using chicken embryos using a new method and seems to be able to prevent the occurrence of typhoid fever. He said that this vaccine has not yet been tested in the United States because the typhoid bacteria in the United States are different, and typhoid fever in the United States is a sporadic disease rather than an infectious disease. Dr. Parran said that he had sent this vaccine to the UK and 20,000 doses to Spain, Romania, Germany, and China, but had not yet received reports on its effectiveness. Dr. Parran said that this vaccine is very effective for monkeys, so it should also be effective for humans. After the last war, there were approximately 10 million to 35 million cases of typhoid fever, so if we can have an effective preventive agent, it will be of great benefit to the world.

### Two Axis Leaders Confer - Future Strategies for Attacking Britain - Second Stage of Actions in the Mediterranean - Planning for American Intervention

London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, each leading their respective foreign affairs authorities, at the Brenner Pass yesterday is very significant as it indicates the need for continued coordination between the two Axis powers. Italy, which has been listening to Germany for many months now, undoubtedly Mussolini and Ciano were summoned to that location to listen to Hitler's new instructions. More than three months have passed since Hitler last personally met with Mussolini. It is noteworthy that the official news about this meeting was first released by Rome. London is not certain about the purpose of this meeting, but it is generally believed that Mussolini is less likely to gain anything from this meeting compared to usual. Given Vichy's servility to Germany, Italy's continued demands to extort France are unlikely to receive Hitler's support. Furthermore, it is even more doubtful whether Hitler will satisfy Mussolini's hopes of profiting from the spoils when Hitler arbitrarily carves up territory. Hitler's gift to Italy may be limited to awarding the Croatian crown to the Italian King's nephew. Radio Lyon reported that Hitler and Mussolini discussed for five hours, only taking a short break for lunch. German General Commander Keitel and Italian General Commander Cavallero also attended the meeting at one point. (Reuters, 3rd)

Berlin - According to a report from a Haitong News Agency reporter, German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass yesterday for five hours. This was the tenth meeting between Hitler and Mussolini. In addition to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, German General Commander Keitel and Italian Chief of Staff Cavallero also participated. The meeting was adjourned at noon, and the six had lunch together. General Keitel and General Cavallero discussed the issue of military cooperation between Germany and Italy. The important Axis officials at the Brenner Pass in recent days included Dr. Dietrich, head of the German intelligence department, Bormann, Secretary-General of the Nazi Party, Bismarck, the German Chargé d'affaires in Italy, and General Rintelen, the German military attaché in Italy. The Italian side included Alfieri, the Italian ambassador to Germany, General Gontini, a key member of the General Staff, General Marras, the Italian military attaché in Germany, and the head of the Diplomatic Corps, Celesia. Hitler and Mussolini held their tenth meeting amidst frequent reports of victories by the Axis joint forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa. The main topic of discussion was various issues after the end of the Battle of Crete. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)

A semi-official Roman statement commented on Hitler and Mussolini's meeting, stating that the cooperation between Italy and Germany in the battles in the Balkans and Crete will not be without results, and the talks may be followed by practical actions. (Reuters, 3rd)

### The Focus of the Brenner Talks - A Prelude to the Invasion of Britain

Rome - The two Axis leaders met at the Brenner Pass yesterday. It is widely believed that German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini discussed the second stage of Axis operations in the Mediterranean following the British defeat on Crete. Following the Axis victory on Crete, a meeting between Hitler and Mussolini was widely expected. Italian newspapers generally regarded the Battle of Crete as a prelude to another battle about to unfold in the Mediterranean region. Most observers believe that future actions were the main topic of discussion yesterday. According to official announcements, there was complete agreement on all points during the meeting. It is widely believed that during yesterday's meeting at the Brenner Pass, Hitler and Mussolini decided whether the Axis forces would invade Britain in the summer or advance eastward in the Mediterranean towards the Suez Canal. Apart from the official announcements, the main topic of the meeting remains an official mystery. The possibility of the Axis powers sending landing forces to attack Britain has resurfaced following the success of the Battle of Crete. Some observers believe that the attack on Crete may have been a "small-scale test" for the invasion of Britain. Italian newspapers openly declared that the Axis forces would pursue the British Mediterranean fleet eastward. The meeting between Hitler and Mussolini was shrouded in even more mystery. Observers also stated that the meeting took place shortly after President Roosevelt's "fireside chat." Axis newspapers generally believe that President Roosevelt's speech indicates that the United States is preparing to join the current war soon. (United Press, 3rd)

### Germany and Italy Have Drafted a Plan to Resolve the Greek Territory

Rome - It was reported yesterday that Hitler and Mussolini have drafted a plan to resolve the Greek territory. It was also heard that the two leaders discussed President Roosevelt's determination to defend the Western Hemisphere and its implications for French West Africa, Cape Verde Islands, and the Azores Islands. (International News Service, 3rd)

Tokyo - This afternoon, Tokyo newspapers speculated about the great significance of Hitler and Mussolini's meeting, paying particular attention to possible actions in the Near East and towards the United States. Asahi Shimbun pointed out that the Japanese Ambassador to Germany recently participated in Axis meetings, indicating that the Brenner Pass meeting between Hitler and Mussolini may have great significance for Japan.

### British Soldiers Retreating to Egypt - Extremely Miserable Conditions - Barefoot and Wounded - British Aircraft Provide Cover for Retreat

Cairo - Imperial and foreign troops, covered in blood-stained rags, mostly barefoot and/or with wounds, returned here yesterday from Crete, ready for the next act of the Mediterranean war. These soldiers were transported from the beaches by British warships, while German and Italian aircraft bombed heavily overhead, forcing British soldiers to seek refuge in seaside caves. The number of soldiers rescued was 15,000. The difficult and dangerous task undertaken by the British army cannot be fully described in words. Souda Bay has been occupied by Axis forces, so rescue operations had to be carried out by destroyers, taking place on the beaches at night. One young officer said, "Crete is unrecognizable after two weeks of fierce fighting. The villages are just piles of ash, and the fields are full of rotting corpses. Chania has been removed from the map. The German attack on Souda Bay was fierce. German soldiers poured in, and the dead piled up like flies, but those who arrived later continued to come." (United Press, 3rd)

Cairo - The British Air Force in the Middle East issued a communique yesterday stating that large formations of British fighter planes and South African aircraft continued to provide cover on Sunday for British warships and merchant ships evacuating British troops from Crete. They intercepted enemy aircraft repeatedly throughout the day, forcing them to retreat before they could attack British ships. In addition to the seven enemy aircraft shot down reported in Sunday's communique, two enemy aircraft were destroyed on Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday night, British bombers attacked the Maleme and Heraklion airfields in Crete, setting off fires in several locations. Four enemy aircraft were destroyed at the Maleme airfield, and several other enemy aircraft were destroyed elsewhere. In addition to engaging in protection and attack activities, the British Air Force also dispatched bomber planes during the retreat to drop medicine and food to supply isolated British troops in various parts of the island.

### New Zealand High Commissioner Praises New Zealand Troops for Bravery

Wellington - New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser broadcast a telegram from Egypt last night, stating that "In view of the difficult circumstances faced by the New Zealand troops, I feel that they have done their duty. This is not only my personal opinion, but General Wavell and the authorities here also believe that the New Zealand troops have performed exceptionally well." He also stated that most of the healthy soldiers and mobile wounded have likely been evacuated from Crete. Fraser did not estimate how many New Zealand troops remain on the island. Fraser praised the Navy's assistance in evacuating the New Zealand troops. Acting New Zealand Prime Minister Nash declared that the Battle of Crete was clearly a delaying action with great value in relation to future wars. He also said that he would convene Parliament next week to inform them of the information the government has obtained. New Zealand Governor-General Walsh sent a telegram to General Freyberg, who commanded the troops on Crete, expressing his respect and conveying his condolences to his subordinates. (Reuters, 3rd)

Melbourne - Australian Prime Minister Menzies spoke about the events on Crete yesterday, praising the bravery of the Australian soldiers. He said that the authorities have taken various steps to send troops and equipment to the Middle East for reinforcements. The troops withdrawn from Crete were more numerous than expected. The Battle of Crete has overturned the German timeline, strengthened our ability to protect the vital area of Egypt and the Suez Canal, and allowed us to stabilize the situation in Iraq by mobilizing troops. However, the current danger is great, and we must be determined to deal with it. There is absolutely no reason for pessimism. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Goering Praises Paratroopers - Achieved a Glorious Victory

Berlin - German Air Force Commander-in-Chief Marshal Goering issued a commendation order to the German troops on Crete yesterday, stating that "Now there are no islands that cannot be conquered." In the short history of our country's air force, a glorious masterpiece has now been completed. Our paratroopers and air force, under the leadership of officers of all ranks, working together with their army comrades, have achieved a rare victory. You paratroopers have displayed your fearless spirit, defeating an absolutely larger enemy with a smaller force. Since the Battle of Narvik in Norway, the air force has cooperated with the mountain troops, and now it has conquered an important island in the Eastern Mediterranean. Comrades, the entire Germany expresses its infinite admiration and gratitude to you." Finally, Marshal Goering expressed his gratitude to the German troops who sacrificed themselves on the island and to the Italian troops who assisted in the battle.

Berlin - German newspapers commented on the end of the Battle of Crete, believing that the island has an important strategic position. After the German army occupied the island, Britain's prestige suffered a great blow. Currently, the island has become a German base in the Eastern Mediterranean, and German aircraft can attack Alexandria more easily. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)

### Germany Announces Clearing British Troops on Crete

Berlin - According to responsible authorities here, after German forces in Crete were ordered to carry out the work of clearing out the remaining British troops, the clearing operation was completed within 24 hours. British troops in an area near Sfakia made a final stand before surrendering, with a total of 3,000 British troops captured. The rapid completion of the clearing operation was largely due to the air force, and there were very few mountain caves on Crete that could be used for escape, so clearing was easy. Now the island will become a new base for the German Air Force. The next task will be to attack the British fleet off the coast of the island and Egypt, and the second step will be to bomb Alexandria and the Suez Canal. British ships bombed in the past week are as follows: May 27, a British aircraft carrier was hit by four bombs, two cruisers were hit and destroyed; May 28, a heavy cruiser, a destroyer, and an oil tanker were each hit and caught fire; May 29, a British patrol boat was damaged; May 29, two British destroyers were sunk; May 31, a destroyer was severely damaged; June 1 and 2, one destroyer each was damaged and sunk. From this, it can be seen that the British fleet's voyage between Crete and Egypt is no longer free. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)

### British Construct New Defense Zone on the Left Bank of the Nile; Germany Suffers Heavy Losses in the Battle of Crete; Britain to Vigorously Defend Cyprus

Cairo, Egypt, the Ministry of Defense announced the establishment of a new defense zone west of the left bank of the Nile, named the "Cairo West Defense Zone." Radio operators from the mechanized border defense forces assigned to this area will receive special allowances. It is widely believed that this demonstrates the Egyptian army's emphasis on the transportation routes in this region. (Reuters, 3rd)

London, a Reuters military commentator stated that the loss of Crete is indeed a temporary setback, but we can learn valuable strategic and practical lessons from it. We firmly believe this can be done. Strategically speaking, the lack of air bases was our weakness in defending Greece and Crete. The British failure to seize the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea months ago to build airfields seems to be an unfortunate oversight. Tactically, Crete's defenses and airfields were inadequate, and the estimated strength of the garrisoned forces was incorrect. However, despite these shortcomings, the defense of Crete remains a glorious and great achievement, a brilliant page in the history of the British Army and Navy. The invading German forces have been severely punished, suffering heavy losses in manpower and aircraft. Whether this will significantly affect German military strength remains to be seen. The next problem is protecting our Alexandria naval base and the Suez Canal, and the defense of Cyprus is also extremely important. We must take full steps to ensure the security of Cyprus. The issue of air power will again be the decisive factor. Unless Germany first devastates Turkey and gains a foothold in Syria, the German air force's attacks on Cyprus will not be as unbridled as they were in Crete. Hitler is currently trying to gain a foothold in Syria. Therefore, many French soldiers stationed in Syria who hate the Nazis and are ready to join General Trugny should be given various incentives, such as encouraging the Free French forces currently stationed in Palestine and Egypt to move directly towards Beirut and Damascus. If so, the British Air Force should protect the Free French forces from attacks by German aircraft stationed in Syria. The time has come for resolute political action, even at the risk of danger, because defending Cyprus requires the friendly assistance of Syria. The situation in Iraq has greatly improved. The rebellion launched by Rashid Ali under Nazi direction has finally collapsed. Britain has thus gained another route for supplying goods to India and a source of oil, and can thereby connect the Arab nations with Britain and ensure the security of the Allied rear. All of this is of great strategic value. The end of the Abyssinian war is also a powerful factor in defending Egypt, as it not only secures Egypt's back door but also allows a large contingent of British troops to be transferred north from Abyssinia. General Wavell may now have sufficient strong forces to launch an offensive against Libya before the enemy forces can be reinforced. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Nazi Troops Land in Latakia, Syria; Syrian French Authorities Actively Deploy to Counter British Attacks

Ankara, according to reliable sources, Nazi troops have landed in Latakia, Syria. These German troops are all wearing tropical helmets and the long boots worn by African troops. The German Chief of Staff was at the port to greet these troops, numbering over five hundred. British military sources say that the Nazi attempt to break through the British blockade between the Dodecanese and Syria is extremely important for the future. The British naval patrol, attempting to capture transport ships with only one night's sailing distance, finds its work particularly difficult. The first confirmed news of the German landing in Latakia came from an official from a neutral country. Military experts believe that Cyprus is the second target of the Nazis in the Mediterranean, the first being the replacement of losses of aircraft, and they will soon begin to remove naval obstacles that are slightly less important than Crete. (Reuters, 3rd)

London, Pete, a Columbia Broadcasting Company representative stationed in Turkey, reported that in the past five days, the number of German aircraft flying eastward from their new Aegean bases to Syria has greatly increased, with some saying it has reached two hundred.

Beirut, the French authorities in Syria are actively taking various measures to prevent a British attack.

London, official sources here confirmed yesterday that after the failure of the Iraqi war, the German expatriates in Mosul have all left the country. However, these sources admitted that the situation in the Kirkuk oil fields remains unstable. Whether the oil fields have suffered severe damage or whether German-Iraqi forces remain there is not yet known. According to unconfirmed official reports, German troops landed in Mosul when the British-Iraqi war was fierce, but it is widely believed that there is German Fifth Column activity there.

### Winant Returns to the United States on a Mission; Carries Peace Proposals; Scheduled to See Roosevelt Today

Washington, an official from the State Department told reporters that U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant's return to the country is only to exchange views on the current situation with government officials. The ambassador has requested a ten-day leave to return to the United States to report on his duties. As far as is known, he is not carrying any special documents from the British government. He will meet with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull today. (Reuters, 3rd)

Washington, well-informed sources here believe that when U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant returns to the United States to report on his duties, he will report to President Roosevelt on Germany's peace proposals. Official and unofficial speculation suggests that Deputy Führer Hess may have presented these peace proposals. It is generally believed that Winant is the only logical person to convey these proposals and news of the British reaction to President Roosevelt. Winant is scheduled to go to the White House tomorrow to confer with the President. The British silence on the "Hess affair" suggests that Hess may have made such proposals. (International News Service, 3rd)

### The Democratic Front Will Ultimately Triumph; Hopkins Writes Analysis

New York, Harry Hopkins, the administrator of the Lend-Lease Act, wrote an article published in the July issue of "American Magazine." Based on the following four facts, he concludes that Hitler will ultimately fail: (1) He lacks true sea power; (2) He is gradually losing air superiority; (3) His economic resources cannot compete with those of Britain and the United States; (4) The United States will never allow Hitler to consolidate his unjust gains, as this would conflict with American interests economically, politically, and morally. Hopkins said, "I do not underestimate Hitler's military organization, which remains the strongest in the world, but its bomber force is now gradually turning from strength to weakness, while the number of British bombers is gradually increasing. Britain is now rapidly advancing and, with our assistance, will catch up with and surpass Germany in a year." Hopkins also praised the British spirit, saying that even if British civilians suffer ten times the bombing they have already endured, it will not break the British people's will to fight, as the British have become indomitable. Hopkins mentioned the necessity of maintaining Britain's maritime lifeline, saying that American naval patrols are being deployed to prevent raiders or submarines from wreaking havoc on the United States in this hemisphere. For its own interests, the United States must send the war materials that its economic power can produce to the Allies and safeguard the world's sea, land, and air forces. The United States has decided on a policy of fully assisting democratic nations, and this assistance must be given immediately and without reservation. Hitler is strong, but the democratic nations are even stronger. (Reuters, 3rd)

### The United States Does Not Freeze Axis Deposits Because They Were Emptied in Advance

### Food: Public Sales of Rice in Both Concessions Have a Stabilizing Effect on the Rice Market

Yesterday's foreign rice market continued to decline, and the situation was weak. The market may have to fall again. The public sale of Hong Kong rice at flat prices has continued to open, and tribute rice is also being offered at flat prices. Rice shops are paying attention to the low-priced Hong Kong and Vietnamese rice. The supply of returned goods on the market is greater than demand. Most large players are eager to devalue their holdings due to the unfavorable environment. Existing inventories are stagnant, and demand is weak. Both spot and futures prices are falling again.

Saigon Number 1 was 138.9 yuan, all down by 3.4 yuan from the previous market. Total trading volume was only about 6,000 bags for spot, and futures were down to 600 tons.

The Municipal Council's foreign rice also arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou Wheel, loaded with 5,000 bags from Hong Kong, arrived at the port yesterday afternoon and docked at its own wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading.

Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice is still limited, due to the weakening of foreign rice prices, sentiment is consistently bearish, and the price fell by 1.2 yuan. Kunshan fresh japonica was 134 yuan, and ordinary japonica was 132 yuan and 130 yuan. Fresh Nanhang early and late rice was 136.7 yuan, and original bags were 140 yuan.

Glutinous rice is also softening. The sales floor has only some scattered demand, and sellers are also easing their intentions. Selling prices have been depreciated by about 2 yuan. Hong Kong white yuan was 113 yuan and 111 yuan, special glutinous rice was 115 yuan, glutinous tea was 105 yuan, and domestic glutinous rice was 102 yuan and 100 yuan.

### The Noodle Market is Weak

The current foreign flour market, after falling the day before, has been impacted by falling rice and oil prices. Actual sales are hesitant, and new wheat will soon be on the market. The selling pressure in the market is very strong. Jinlong brand Kampong flour first fell to 29 yuan. Australian flour once held up, but eventually became unsustainable. In the afternoon, Zhonglou brand was trading at 29.8 yuan. Bank-stored rice flour was also soft at 29.2 yuan for Paotai brand American flour, down 5.6 yuan from the previous day. Total transactions were 5-6,000 bags. Foreign flour also continued to arrive yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou Wheel, loaded with 1,500 bags from Hong Kong, arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at its own wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. Today, there were 600 bags loaded on the Anqing Wheel heading to Xiamen.

There were no transactions in wheat. Although new wheat from the mainland and nearby has been released, shipments to Shanghai are still pending. Old wheat inventories in Shanghai are already low, but there is still plenty in the mainland, but it cannot be exported due to transportation difficulties. There may be many twists and turns in bringing this year's new wheat to Shanghai.

### Miscellaneous Grains: New White Beans Seen

Yesterday, new broad beans with white skin from Jiading were seen as samples. The quality of the crop is similar to that of the green broad beans. According to industry insiders, the beans are thin and small due to damage from spring snow, rain, and hail, which hindered their development. These beans have not yet been shipped to Shanghai because the transportation permits have not been issued. It was rumored yesterday that a batch of uncertified goods were inquired about by Japanese merchants for a price of 35 yuan. Green broad beans are still from Beigang, priced at 42.8 yuan per disk. Hong Kong and Quanzhou merchants handled over 300 bags. The price of soybeans has depreciated. Tianjin soybeans are priced at 48 yuan, with Hong Kong merchants handling over 3,000 bags. Mujie distributed 200 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans at a price of 46 yuan, and over 400 bags of Guide soybeans at prices ranging from 45.2 to 45.5 yuan. This morning, 930 bags of soybeans and 200 bags of shelled peanuts were shipped to Xiamen, and another 280 bags of soybeans were shipped to Singapore. A large amount of corn has also arrived in Shanghai. The Java mail steamers Zhigen No. 2 and Zhishali arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, bringing over 30,000 bags of corn from Java, which were unloaded at the Puxi Lanyancong Wharf. Yesterday, 2,500 bags of corn were loaded onto the new Beijing steamer for shipment to Yantai.

### Securities: Public Bonds Frequently Rise and Slightly Fall

The unofficial market for public bonds continued to strengthen yesterday. However, after a six- or seven-day rally, prices eased slightly in the afternoon. The situation may not necessarily take a sharp turn downwards. Most of the sellers were covering their positions, with more new short positions being opened. If there is any support, the market will not be easy to underestimate. Yesterday morning, most of the sellers on Jiucheng, Yitai, and Runli were covering their positions. Hengkang, Hongda, and Xinfu added to their long positions. Xiexing, Wuxie, and Kangda were mostly long positions closing out. Xinhua and Yongkang slightly sold off. Class C bonds were quickly hoarded at 8 yuan, reaching a high price of 8.4 yuan. Class B bonds also broke through the 70 yuan barrier. Few people paid attention to Class A bonds, and they failed to follow the upward trend, remaining at their original price. In the afternoon, Hongda, Xinfu, Defu, Xinchang, Dade, and Yongkang all bought in, but the selling pressure was stronger, and prices retreated slightly as soon as they rose, but the decline was limited. Lianhe, Tongshun, Yichang, and Lianyi were all selling off one after another. Prices retreated slightly by one or two jiao in the afternoon. As a result, except for Class D bonds, which fell slightly by two jiao, the rest still rose by two or three jiao, but Class A bonds only rose by five fen. The total transaction volume was approximately 2.5 million yuan. A brief summary table is provided below.

Stock trading: 93 shares of Sanyou Industrial Society were traded at a price of 23 yuan each.

The public stock market was slightly softened in a very stable environment. Transactions were still scarce, and both operators and suppliers felt uninteresting.

London, 2nd (Monday) dispatch: Today is a British holiday, and the securities market is closed for the day.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculative Selling Intention Re-emerges; Yarn Market Shows Slight Weakness

The yarn market, which had rebounded the previous day, showed a slight weakness yesterday. This was because speculators, seeing that the upward trend had subsided, revived their intention to sell. As a result, a group of sellers shorted the market, and the market slightly retreated. However, although actual sales were not smooth, they were more active than before. At the same time, raw materials were not willing to fall significantly, so some people still bought in when prices fell. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1455 yuan, and the low price was 1435 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial transaction price was 1430 yuan. Midway through, due to good bid prices, it rose to 1436 yuan. Due to the activity of short sellers, it fell to 1427 yuan, and the final price was 1430 yuan. Currently, some people in the yarn market say that it may hover between 1430 and 1450 yuan. Today, 25 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Penang.

Shuangma yarn opened in the morning, continuing the firm momentum from the previous day. Unexpectedly, the opening price was high, and the public called for selling. As a result, the market was not responsive. The initial price was 1450 yuan, and it soon rose to 1455 yuan. However, there were many sellers, and the market quickly softened to 1442 yuan. But it fluctuated for a long time between 42 and 43 yuan. Around 12 o'clock, the momentum suddenly weakened, with rumors of peace, and the closing price fell to 1435 yuan. It is found that the turnover in half a day was 8,300 bales, including 300 bales purchased by Hong Kong merchants and 8,000 bales by domestic merchants.

### Cotton Market Shows Slight Improvement

Although there is no large-scale development in the current cotton trade, people's confidence can still be maintained. Because overseas prices are not falling, the public still has high hopes for fine-grade raw materials. With appropriate prices, there are occasional fluctuations, so although consumption is limited, market prices remain unchanged. However, ginned cotton is in a slump, and it is still difficult to hear any news of its recovery.

Another report: The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has recently been severely affected by the yarn market and factories. At the same time, the international situation is deteriorating. As a result, all parties seem to be reluctant to purchase in large quantities, but the market situation is still quite stable. Yesterday, traders traded 200 bales of Brazilian cotton at around 450 yuan, which were transshipped to Qingdao.

The New York cotton market is sluggish and unremarkable. Yesterday's closing price rose slightly by three to five points.

The Indian cotton market is closed. It is also predicted that the opening market today will fall by about two rupees compared to the previous day.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Gradually Rises

The market trend for factory cloth was slightly firm yesterday, and the popularity was stable. Therefore, the selling prices of various cloths turned from falling to rising. Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth continued to be purchased by Nanyang merchants, and each lot rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. The June futures for 16-pound Caihua Butterfly Group cloth opened at 49.5 yuan, which is 7.5 jiao higher than the current market price. Fugui fine cloth opened at 42.75 yuan in the morning, and fine twill at 39 yuan. It slightly recovered in the afternoon, and all rose compared to the previous day. The street traded about two hundred pieces of various cloths. Nanyang merchants purchased over two hundred pieces of Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth, coarse twill, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. Today, 9 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Xiamen, another 100 pieces to Singapore, and 20 pieces to Penang.

The market price of Dongbu cloth remains in a state of fluctuation. In the current market, because there are not many warehouse receipts, the selling price in the morning is particularly tight. In the afternoon, the futures of the exchange's leading products fell by six or seven jiao, and the current goods were also affected by it. The closing price of Longtou fine cloth factory orders was 44.55 yuan, and Sijunzi serge was 1.41875 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Black Fungus Tightens Again

Recently, the black fungus market has become more active, and the quoted price has become firmer again. For example, Sichuan fungus is quoted at over 800 yuan, and Hekou fungus is quoted at over 760 yuan. The market price is also following closely, and there is hope for further increases.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Futures Are Difficult to Save; Continue to Fall Sharply

Yesterday's opening price for raw white sugar futures showed a slight rebound, but it still fell gradually afterwards, and the downward trend was difficult to reverse. Moreover, the far-term price was lower, which was a reversed situation, indicating that the sharp decline seemed not to be over yet. The association's quoted price for spot goods was: 24 raw white sugar for old goods arriving in January was 90 yuan, down 1.3 yuan; new goods arriving in May was 91.6 yuan, down 3 yuan. The June 10th futures opened at 95.2 yuan in the morning and closed at 94 yuan. In the afternoon, it opened at 94 yuan and fell to 92 yuan, down 2.8 yuan. The June 20th futures were 94.4 yuan to 93.3 yuan in the morning and 92.9 yuan to 91.2 yuan in the afternoon, down about 4 yuan. Newly arrived Dutch red sugar futures fell to 73 yuan, a decrease of 8 yuan compared to last Monday. Taikoo vehicle white sugar was relatively flat, with the Western warehouse price at 103.5 yuan, with little fluctuation. Yesterday, 1,620 bags of sugar were shipped from Hong Kong.

Recently, the supply of medicinal gorgon fruit has been insufficient, and the market inventory has been decreasing day by day. As scarce goods are more valuable, the price has been rising steadily. The market price for white skin medicinal gorgon fruit was quoted at 160 yuan yesterday, and it was sold for over 156 yuan. However, red skin goods were not selling well and showed signs of softening. It has fallen from 120 yuan to 115 yuan, and the next grade is 110 yuan.

### Coal: Few Buyers for White Coal

The price of white coal has been gradually decreasing in this off-season of summer. There is only falling and no rising. During the Dragon Boat Festival, the price fell even more drastically because the owners released large quantities of goods to liquidate their holdings. After the price of coal balls increased, it rebounded slightly, but it was also the end of its strength and was unable to do anything. This is the general trend. Yesterday, Tongdeli white coal was shouted out at 430 yuan by traders, but there were few buyers. It is said that new goods will arrive soon, and the long-term outlook is not good.

### Miscellaneous Items: Soap Sales Are Sluggish

The soap market is mediocre. Although factory prices have increased, few local customers are purchasing, and hoarders are watching. Recently, Guben soap is priced at 53.5 yuan per case, Baixiangmao at 44.5 yuan per case, Arrow Knife soap at 42 yuan per case, and Henry Love soap at 42 yuan per case, all without change. Huangxiangmao is priced at 42.5 yuan per case, and transactions are relatively active. The candle market has increased again, but it is difficult to change the market buying price because sales are concentrated in rural areas and usage decreases in summer. For example, ship candles are priced at 27.4 yuan per case, which is slightly higher than before.

### Peanuts (Continued)

— Gao Jiannong

Now, various countries around the world have an increasing need for peanuts, because they are indeed a very precious thing. It—who doesn't know this?—whether fried, boiled, deep-fried, candied, or salted, there is no way of eating that is not delicious and satisfying! It is truly suitable for both sweet and savory, and welcomed by both the old and the young! Therefore, in many kinds of candies and pastries, there are its beautiful silhouettes adorning them. As for the oil extracted from it, it can be eaten, burned, used to make soap, lubricate machines, and recently even used to make "margarine"... Moreover, even the residue left over from pressing the oil is an excellent fertilizer for feeding livestock or fertilizing fields: you say, it should occupy such an important position in agriculture, industry, commerce, or people's daily use!

Moreover, according to the results of chemical analysis—numbers omitted!—the nutrients contained in peanuts far exceed those of soybeans, fish, and meat! This lovely "long-life" fruit, if we can enjoy it as much as possible, it is hard to say that it can really make us live forever, but at least it can make our lives a little longer. It is probably not too much to say! However, this lovely only gift to the common people, which before the war could be bought in considerable quantities for one or two cents to satisfy one's cravings, is now a bit "too high to reach"! Oh my god! "Who gives us 'long life'?"...

### Various Circles Commemorate Anti-Smoking Day Yesterday, Embracing the Spirit of Rejecting Drugs, Automatically Assisting the Government in Eliminating the Atmosphere of Poison, Smokers Vow to Quit, Strengthen the Body, and Strengthen the Country

Yesterday was the 102nd anniversary of Lin Wenzhong (Zexu)'s burning of opium in Humen. It was designated by the central government as Anti-Smoking Day. All sectors of the public in Shanghai, in order to assist the government in promoting the prohibition policy and revitalize the national spirit, made concerted efforts to promote the anti-drug movement. The First and Second Higher Courts burned confiscated drugs, and various groups issued letters to smokers, urging them to wake up immediately, quit their habits voluntarily, save unnecessary expenses, and restore their healthy bodies. The details of each situation are recorded below.

Pledging to Obey the National Policy and Work Together to Reject Drugs

Yesterday was "June 3rd" Anti-Smoking Day. The National Government believes that the harm of opium and drugs is more serious than floods and fierce beasts. Once addicted, it can make people spiritless, ambitious, and trapped, causing physical harm. Therefore, in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the National Anti-Smoking Committee was established. President Chiang was appointed as the Anti-Smoking Supervisor to stipulate a three-year drug ban and a six-year smoking ban. It was originally hoped that within this time limit, opium and drugs would disappear from all parts of the country. Therefore, local governments vigorously implemented the policy. Except for the rear areas during the war, which had been eradicated last year, the occupied areas, due to special circumstances, had the opposite effect, and the spread of opium and drugs was even more serious than before the promotion of the anti-smoking policy, resulting in a sharp increase in the number of smokers. The anti-smoking policy failed, so the whole country is deeply vigilant, and vows to respect the national policy and jointly promote the anti-drug movement, so that they can make persistent efforts to eliminate opium and drugs as soon as possible, rescue smokers from the depths of misery, strengthen their bodies, save unnecessary consumption, and strengthen the country.

The Court Follows the Routine and Burns Drugs

The Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the First Special Zone District Court, in order to complete the prohibition policy and implement "Rejecting Drugs to Get to the Root" and "Rejecting Drugs to the Utmost," have adopted the strictest criminal law for opium and drug cases in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The police authorities also take their work seriously, taking the elimination of opium and drugs in the area as their duty. Therefore, the two courts hold burnings of confiscated opium, drug items, and utensils on Anti-Smoking Day to show their intention to promote anti-smoking and commemorate Anti-Smoking Day. Yesterday, the work of burning opium and drugs was carried out as usual. In the future, the punishment of opium and drug offenders will strictly comply with the recently promulgated regulations on punishment by the Ministry of Justice, in order to achieve the purpose of eliminating opium and drugs.

Smokers Awaken and Strive to Quit

Various groups in the wooden market issued a letter to all smokers in the city yesterday to commemorate Anti-Smoking Day, saying, "On June 3, 1839, Lin Zexu, the Governor-General of Huguang, burned 20,000 boxes of imported opium in Humen, Guangzhou. Because of the incompetence of the Qing government at that time, opium and drugs continued to spread in the country. The British psychologist Hall said, 'One cannot create a first-class country with third-class nationals.' 'With a golden age of physique, there will be a golden age of culture thirty years later.' These short words fully illustrate that health is the key to the strength of a country. During the current period of resistance and construction, we should especially cherish our bodies, conserve our energy, and strive for the country and the nation. Make persistent efforts and show their inner strength. Know that addiction to opium and drugs can lead to the demise of lofty ambitions, spiritual decline, physical loss, and thought constraints, but our government does not suspend the prohibition policy due to the war. Opium and drug criminals will still be punished with strict criminal penalties, and it is stipulated that repeat offenders will be severely punished in the future. Smokers throughout the city, this is how dangerous it is. You should quit as soon as possible and start over as a good citizen, carry forward your own cause, and undertake the responsibility of revitalizing the country and the nation, so as not to be ashamed of the lessons taught to us by Lin Wenzhong and Chairman Chiang one after another."

Lide Society Encourages Self-Awareness and Awareness of Others

The Shanghai Lide Friendship Association issued a statement to the public saying,

"The issue of anti-smoking in our country has gone through a long period of effort. Anyone who cares about the future of the country cannot but think of the seriousness of this issue. Because if opium and drugs are not eliminated, the adverse results can hinder the normal evolution of society and destroy the safety of the nation's life. The issue of anti-smoking in our country is in fact an issue with interlocking political and diplomatic relations. It is a method of undermining our national spirit and national consciousness. However, the issue of anti-smoking is a serious issue concerning social security and the life and death of the nation. It is a simple fact that is easy to see and should be done in the present. On today's isolated island full of poisons, we must raise the banner of national consciousness, arouse public attention from an objective and rational perspective, and be aware of ourselves and others. Eliminating opium and drugs, this minimum hope, is a request and a gift that we make to the citizens in commemorating June 3rd Memorial Day."

### The Xiafei Wheel Sailed Directly to Haiphong Yesterday, Without Stopping Along the Way; The Coolidge Wheel Will Arrive in Port Tonight and Sail to Hong Kong Tomorrow

The Marshal Xiafei, a new ship of the French Mail Steamship Company that recently joined the Shanghai-Defense route, arrived in Shanghai on the 25th of last month after loading tribute rice from Defense. It was originally intended to moor in Shanghai for four days before loading cargo and sailing to Defense. However, due to a telegram from Saigon, the trip was postponed, which caused speculation from the outside world, saying that the Shanghai-Defense route would be suspended. It is now known that the Marshal Xiafei left the No. 11 and 12 pontoons yesterday morning and sailed directly to Haiphong. It did not stop at other ports along the way.

Many of these trucks were previously shipped from Germany and run on vegetable oil. It is also understood that China Automobile Manufacturing Company can manufacture all automobile parts itself. According to Otto Wolff Company, a German company, the Shanghai office is located in the Hamilton Building, Jiangxi Road, Shanghai.

### Sanbei Company Establishes Office in Hong Kong

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, who inquired about Yu's relatives in Shanghai, Yu is preparing to set up an office of Sanbei Company in Hong Kong and has begun to arrange it. After half a month, it can be completed. Afterwards, Yu will travel between Chongqing and Hong Kong and will not return to Shanghai for the time being.

### Xi Yushu Leaves Shanghai for Hong Kong

According to reliable sources, Xi Yushu, the Chinese director of the Public Works Bureau, has resigned and gone to Hong Kong. Xi has been a Chinese director of the Public Works Bureau for nearly ten years. Since the reorganization of the board of directors, he has not attended several meetings. People generally worried that Xi had been kidnapped, but now it is known that he left Shanghai last week.

### Re-Evaluation of Land is Suspended

According to the Public Works Bureau, the board of directors of this bureau carefully considered the case of re-evaluating the property in the public concession. As a result, in view of the current abnormal state, it was decided to suspend the re-evaluation. It will be re-examined when the situation returns to normal in the future.

### Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Bank is Established by Lace and Other Industries

### The Second Batch of Hong Kong Rice is Sold Throughout the City Today; Smuggling of Rice Out of the Port is Found to be Inventory; Group Purchases of Rice Still Require Rice Shops to Handle

The second batch of small-grained rice ordered by the Public Works Bureau began to be distributed the day before yesterday. More than 20 miscellaneous grain shops that have been assigned to have started paying and picking up goods yesterday. Currently, more than 80 rice shops in the wooden port have seen a sharp increase in the number of citizens purchasing small-grained rice. The distributed rice has been completely sold out and cannot meet the market demand. According to rice industry news yesterday, all rice shops that have sold out the small-grained rice at affordable prices can pick up goods today to meet the market demand. In the future, the agency for small-grained rice orders handled by the Public Works Bureau will try to handle it as quickly as possible and provide sufficient supply to avoid the drawbacks of interruption.

Group Purchases Should Wait for Permission

The current affordable small-grained rice handled by the authorities is agreed upon by the Hong Kong government to provide 200,000 to 250,000 bags per month. Now, in order to allow a large amount of small-grained rice to circulate on the market, in addition to the sale by rice shops without quantity restrictions, agencies, groups, companies, and factories are also allowed to purchase in large quantities. However, the purchase procedures cannot be directly applied for purchase from Liji or Xiangmao. They must still be purchased from retail rice shops, and the retail rice shops must apply to Xiangmao. Only after permission is obtained can the transaction be concluded.

Rice Shops Subject to Penalties Should Pay Quickly

If rice shops do not go to Xiangmao Foreign Firm to pay and pick up goods after the deadline, the Public Works Bureau will immediately cancel their distribution rights. After the news spread, the rice shops applied one after another, and many rice shops have been restored to sales. However, there are still 18 rice shops that have not yet paid. According to Liji Xiangmao Foreign Firm, if these 18 rice shops do not apply again, their distribution rights will be permanently revoked. It is found that these rice shops include 4 in the French Concession, 2 in the central area of the Public Concession, 3 in the Xinzha area and Jing'an Temple area, 2 in the Putuo area, 1 in the Hongkou area, 4 in the Huishan area, and 2 in the Yangshupu area. According to Fukang Rice Shop, the sales of Hong Kong rice have never been interrupted.

Smuggling Exports is Confirmed by the Business Community

According to external rumors, the rice industry knows that the rice prices in the coastal ports of South China are much higher than in Shanghai due to special circumstances. Smuggling foreign rice from Shanghai is very profitable. People in the business community confirmed this statement, saying that the amount of rice shipped out is small and is not the Yangon rice purchased by the Public Works Bureau, but the foreign rice from Saigon and other places currently stored in Shanghai.

The Arrested Employees Have Been Released

The Shanghai Rice Shop Industry Association sent a letter to the Director of the French General Patrol Room yesterday, requesting the release of the employees of the rice shop industry. It is heard that they have been completely released. The letter to the Political Department of the Public Concession Public Works Bureau said, "It is found that on May 28 of this year, the employees of the rice shop industry launched a strike to demand improved treatment. Due to the employees inciting strikes to various rice shops, there was a disturbance. The patrol room detained many people. After persuasion, work was resumed on the 29th. The representatives of the employees and the association held talks on May 30 at 4 p.m. The labor representatives put forward two requests: (1) Please assist the capital side in requesting the patrol room to release the arrested employees. (2) Reinstate all employees dismissed during the Dragon Boat Festival this year."

Labor-Capital Negotiations Have Not Yet Been Conducted

The labor and capital sides agreed verbally that the capital side would assist in the request for the first point, and for the second point, the labor side would provide a list and investigate the reasons for the dismissal from the stores and try to mediate. During the talks, the representatives of both sides agreed to negotiate salary increase conditions at the association's meeting hall at 2 p.m. on June 1, but the labor side did not send representatives to attend at that time, so the negotiations could not proceed. However, in order to express its sincerity and avoid the expansion of the labor unrest and disrupt the public order, the association specially reported the progress of the negotiations truthfully, and requested that the department ask the legal department to exempt the arrested employees from prosecution, and notify the patrol rooms to release the employees of the rice shop industry who were detained due to the labor unrest in order to show leniency and enable the negotiations to continue, so as not to cause other incidents."

### Anderson Comes to Shanghai to Take Office

The headquarters of the American Red Cross appointed Anderson, the manager of American MetLife Insurance Company, as the president of the Shanghai District Red Cross branch, succeeding Jitter. After receiving the order, Anderson took the President Coolidge Wheel from San Francisco to Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to arrive here at 10 a.m. this morning, and the passenger boat will arrive at the pier at 11 a.m. this morning. Anderson will arrive on the ship, take a short rest, and then take office. Jitter, the original president of the branch here, will return to his country after the handover is completed.

### US Relinquishes Extraterritorial Rights in China: Promoting China's Strength to Prevent Japan's Abuse of This Privilege, Hindering the Development of Chinese Nationalism

The Ta Kung Pao comments that US Secretary of State Hull recently declared in Washington that the US will relinquish its extraterritorial rights in China once peace is restored. Those familiar with Sino-American relations will not find this declaration surprising, as they know that the US views extraterritorial rights in China as merely a temporary measure. Furthermore, the US has repeatedly expressed its sympathy and understanding for China's desire to fully govern its own country.

The US Government Planned to Relinquish Rights Early

In fact, the US government had long planned to relinquish its extraterritorial rights in China. However, this was not achieved because other countries refused to follow suit. More than a decade ago, the Chinese actively campaigned to abolish extraterritorial rights for all countries in China. This was halted due to the Mukden Incident in 1931. Japanese aggression is the main obstacle to the growth of Chinese nationalism.

Eager for China to Achieve Its Wishes

However, the Chinese deeply believe that the American people and their government are very
eager to help China achieve its legitimate wish to abolish extraterritorial rights. If Chinese friends in London could express the same sentiment, the Chinese would be even more excited. In fact, this is very possible because in recent years, Britain and the US have often adopted parallel policies in dealing with various issues in the East.

Other Countries Obstructing from Within

Other countries use their extraterritorial rights in China
to interfere in China's internal affairs and hinder China's progress. The main reason why the Chinese people have been slow to understand their own position since the 1911 revolution is that some countries have abused extraterritorial rights.

Relinquishing Special Rights is Self-Defense

In recent years, Japan has used its extraterritorial rights as a shield for its aggression in China. Britain and the US are both aware that Japan's abuse of this privilege not only harms the interests of the Chinese people but also harms the rights of Britain and the US in China. The reason why Western democratic countries are willing to relinquish this privilege is that they hope to promote China's strength, which in turn will curb Japan's ambitions. Japan has long harbored hatred and hostility towards Western countries. Brazilian Minister to China, Mr. and Mrs. Laigo, visited Shanghai briefly and departed for Beiping yesterday on the Kai Ping steamer.

### Advertising Allowed on Rickshaw Backs

According to an announcement by the Public Works Bureau, the Board of Directors of the Bureau approved the application to use the backs of public rickshaws for advertising at its regular meeting on the 28th of last month. However, the following regulations must be followed: (1) All advertisements must first be approved by the Police Department. (2) Paper advertisements are not allowed. (3) The fee for each rickshaw used for advertising is one yuan per month (the fee may be revised by the Bureau at any time). The fee must be paid in advance on a monthly basis, and applicants must report the rickshaw license number to the Bureau. Once reported, the fee will be charged regardless of whether the vehicle is used for advertising or not. The approved advertising license plate must be attached to the conspicuous position of each vehicle. Rickshaw licensees are responsible for paying the fee.

It must be stated that the Bureau does not intend to grant any exclusive rights to applicants for this type of advertising. The Bureau's permission may be revoked at any time. In addition, those who wish to advertise on rickshaws operating in the French Concession should also apply for approval from the French Concession Municipal Council.

### Difficulties in Raw Materials for Various Industries

Spinning Mills and Other Industries Face Operational Difficulties According to a report by the Industrial Section of the Public Works Bureau, the operating conditions of most spinning mills last month were almost the same as before the implementation of electricity restrictions. Thirty managers and engineers from seventeen Chinese-owned spinning mills held a second meeting to discuss methods of saving electricity in order to minimize production reduction and maintain workers' income as much as possible. Several paper mills have extended the workers' bi-monthly holidays to reduce working hours. The price of coarse yarn has fallen sharply, but fine yarn prices remain high. Since the 12th of last month, silver firms have refused to provide loans against cotton yarn, causing panic selling and a decline in the yarn market. Coupled with the Dragon Boat Festival season, selling pressure has increased, further reducing yarn and cloth prices. The woolen industry has been affected due to difficulties in sourcing raw materials and seasonal factors. Only four silk mills are still in operation, but silk weaving mills continue to operate as usual. In addition, printing ink, paint, steel, timber, and rubber industries all face difficulties in sourcing raw materials.

There were 99 accidents in factories, including 11 fatalities. The Industrial Section is actively promoting industrial safety in factories. Last month, 50 factories were found to have improved their equipment. In addition, there were 11 factory fires, resulting in 6 worker deaths and 10 injuries.

### The Practice of the Five Religions and the Exclusive Responsibility of Confucianism

The 16th lecture of the Rong Wu Sutra Society was given by Mr. Sun Xiangzhong on the practice of the five religions and the exclusive responsibility of Confucianism, divided into five sections:

(1) The original driving force behind the promotion of each religion: 1. Humanity inherently possesses the entire vitality of the universe, which manifests as the functions of emotion, reason, and will. 2. The initial cause arises from faith, perceiving life beyond the individual. The subsequent result is regarded as a miracle, connecting with all life and achieving self-sacrificing morality.

(2) The evolutionary process of each religion: Religion has no so-called evolution or regression. Its process evolves with culture. 1. Those with lower culture are willing to accept external control and often worship natural objects. 2. Those with higher culture know how to use their own strength to focus on human relations.

(3) The characteristics, similarities, and differences of the five religions: Among the five religions, Confucianism values human relations, Buddhism clarifies the nature of the soul, Taoism venerates the Way of Heaven, Christianity reveres God, and Islam speaks of the True Master. Their teachings mostly focus on moral action. Therefore, morality is the fundamental issue of religion. However, due to slight differences in what each religion reveres, there are many differences in doctrines and tenets.

(4) The exclusive responsibility of Confucianism: 1. In the Han Dynasty, books such as Jia Yi's New Book, Liu An's Huainanzi, and Yang Xiong's Tai Xuan Jing all focused on explaining Confucianism and Taoism. In the Tang and Song Dynasties, Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism were harmonized, and the theories became richer. The recent trend of integrating the five religions is indeed a requirement of the times. 2. Confucianism is the backbone of integration. Confucianism carries benevolence, humility, fortitude, and complete virtue. Confucian scholars are good at harmonizing the world. In the court, they correct policies; among the people, they beautify customs. From this, we can glimpse the reality of Confucianism. 3. Confucianism is indeed what humanity needs. Each religion is beneficial to humanity. Within each religion, there is no lack of true Confucianism and Taoism. Therefore, when Confucianism and Taoism are practiced, all religions are practiced. The constancy and dual virtues of Confucianism are vast.

(5) The ultimate goal of humanity: Humanity universally desires universal harmony and ultimate bliss, achieving the unity of all beings. The unity of all beings means non-duality of things, non-duality of body and mind, non-duality of God and man, and non-duality of worldly and otherworldly laws.

Mr. Sun gave an enthusiastic lecture, and the audience listened with great attention, applauding continuously. On that day, the lecture hall combined two rooms into one, yet it was still full, demonstrating the growing interest of the audience.

### Wang Yusen Assassinated on Ximen Road, Xihufang Yesterday Morning: Assailants Entered Bedroom and Opened Fire

Another shooting murder case occurred yesterday morning within the French Concession. The victim was Wang Yusen, a native of Nanjing, who was shot four times on the spot and died soon after due to the severity of his injuries. The details of the murder case are as follows:

From Vietnam to Shanghai

Wang Yusen, a 52-year-old native of Nanjing, had been running an antique shop in Vietnam. Last October, Wang brought his concubine, Ms. Ma (a 20-year-old native of Nanjing), and two daughters from his previous wife (one seven years old and one six years old) to Shanghai. They immediately rented the front building of the second floor at No. 66 Xihufang, Ximen Road, in the French Concession, paying a monthly rent of 40 yuan, and have lived there until now.

Assailants Enter

At around 8:10 yesterday morning, three men in short clothes suddenly entered the alley from Huabei Apartments on Marlang Road. They entered No. 66 through the back door and went straight upstairs. One of the three men, dressed in black silk crepe and about 30 years old, pushed open Wang's bedroom door and entered. The other two men remained on guard by the stairs. The man saw Wang lying on the bed and immediately pulled out a pistol and fired four shots at Wang.

Four Bullets Fatal

Wang was sleeping facing outward, so he could not avoid the attack. All four bullets hit him, one each in the left and right chest and one each in the left abdomen. He screamed and collapsed, mortally wounded on the spot. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the gunmen fled downstairs with their accomplices and disappeared without a trace. Upon receiving the news, the French police dispatched a large contingent of Chinese and Western detectives to hunt down the suspects, but they were unsuccessful. They then sent Wang's body to the coroner's office for an autopsy and are conducting a thorough investigation into the case.

### Fire on Daxi Road Yesterday Morning: More Than a Hundred Thatched Sheds Destroyed

At around 2:00 yesterday morning, more than a hundred thatched sheds in Wangjianong, Daxi Road, suddenly caught fire. The Fire Brigade urgently dispatched six fire engines to the scene, and the fire was extinguished at around 8:00 a.m. The thatched sheds were completely destroyed, and the fire spread to five nearby small factories and more than a dozen wooden houses behind the British barracks on Daxi Road.

Fire Also Occurred on Haining Road Yesterday Afternoon

At around 12:28 yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out at No. 208 Haining Road. The flames raged and spread to Nos. 210 and 212, destroying them completely, and also affected the roofs of Nos. 206 and 114. The Fire Brigade rushed to the scene with hose carts and extinguished the fire in about two hours.

### Rice Shop Employees Embezzle

Zhang Wenyu, Li Yunfu, Zhang Bingchun, Wang Yanfang, Gu Maolin, Xin Qingfu, and several other employees of the Tongfeng Le Rice Shop at No. 38 HeDe Road, embezzled rice because their request to shop owner Cao Dade for increased subsidies was denied. The shop owner discovered that 40 bags of rice were missing from the warehouse and reported it to the police. Zhang Wenyu was arrested. Zhang and others admitted to conspiring to embezzle rice because they could not make ends meet, and confessed that they had sold six bags of rice to the Hecheng Rice Shop in Wangjianong, Daxi Road. Yesterday morning, Zhang and others were escorted to the First Special Court, where Judge Shi ordered them to be detained for further investigation.

### Perfume Alley Robbery: Pedestrian Robbed Last Night

At around 8:15 last night, a man was walking through Xiangfen Lane in the Public Concession when he was suddenly stopped by three unarmed robbers. They robbed him of 495 yuan in cash and fled.

### Shen Qiquan's Eightieth Birthday Yesterday

Shen Hongquan, a former historian from Jiaxing, celebrated his eightieth birthday yesterday (the 3rd). Relatives and friends in Shanghai held a celebration for him at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant. Several hundred people, including Chen Zhilong, Shen Tingqing, and Zhang Yishu, attended. Members of the Pingsheng Opera Society sang a cappella, making it a grand occasion.

Favorable Subscription for Children's News

Children's News, in view of the upcoming summer vacation, intends to compile and print a special summer supplement to facilitate students' summer studies. More than 50 leading figures in children's education will contribute articles. The content is rich and extremely suitable for schools to adopt as required summer reading material. The newspaper's favorable subscription rate for the summer is only one yuan. There are preferential rates for group subscriptions in bulk.

### Huge Robbery at Post Office: Suspects Arrested, Several Post Office Employees Suspected and Detained, Stolen Funds Returned to Post Office by Japanese Side

The English-language China Press reported that the main culprits in the huge robbery of 2.5 million yuan from the General Post Office last Saturday morning, one Chinese and one Japanese, were arrested on Sunday. All of the stolen funds have also been recovered. After solving the case, the Japanese authorities continued to hunt down suspects. It is reported that a large number of employees in departments such as the Postal Remittance Department have been closely questioned by the Japanese authorities, as it is rumored that someone in the Remittance Department reported the news when the funds arrived.

Suspects Arrested

Approximately 18 people have been arrested on suspicion of involvement in the case. It is expected that more arrests will be made today (the 3rd). The Japanese authorities announced that all of the stolen funds were found in the residence of the main suspect, Japanese national Masao Nomura, on Shi Gao Ta Road. The suspect had previously worked in a certain unit of the Japanese Army but was dismissed a month ago for dishonesty. The Japanese side is still investigating the case and will return the stolen funds to the Postal Administration after the investigation is completed.

Close Cooperation

Regarding the report that police officers from the Public Concession were not allowed to enter Nomura's residence to search, the Japanese authorities claimed that the residence was outside the border of the Public Concession, so police officers from the Concession were not allowed to search it. However, police officers from the Public Works Bureau stated that they cooperated closely with the Japanese side to solve the case but did not intend to search Nomura's residence.

Stolen Funds Returned

In another report, the total amount of stolen funds temporarily held at the headquarters of the Japanese Military Police was returned to the Post Office yesterday morning after Deputy Director of the Japanese Postal Administration, Kinzashi Kin-ichiro, negotiated with the Japanese side. It is also reported that the arrested Liang had lived in Shanghai for more than 20 years and was acquainted with many employees of the Post Office. After Liang learned the news about the large sum of money being transported to the Post Office, he went to Masao Nomura to discuss the matter. They then hired a car from the Dasen Motor Company, driven by driver Dong Liankui (30 years old), to go to the Post Office. Dong was arrested by the Japanese side after the incident, and the entire case was solved easily.

### Resolution of Salary Dispute at Pei Chu Elementary School: No Classes at Zhen Huan Elementary School, Patriotic Le'an Negotiating

Apart from the satisfactory resolution of the Pei Chu Elementary School dispute yesterday, there are still school disputes in this city that have not been resolved, such as at Zhen Huan Elementary School. The parties involved are mediating separately. The following is a breakdown of the situation at each school, as learned by a Dahua News Agency reporter:

Pei Chu Elementary School The dispute at Pei Chu Elementary School on Xiaoshadu Road, Haifang Road, was resolved satisfactorily yesterday with the mediation of the parties involved. The school agreed to pay each teacher a relief allowance of 60 yuan, and the previously issued living allowance will not be deducted. The teachers are satisfied, and the dispute has ended.

Patriotic No. 2 Elementary School The attitudes of both sides in the dispute at Patriotic No. 2 Elementary School on Mai Te He Si Te Road, Aiwener Road, have become closer and are being mediated by the parties involved. A satisfactory resolution is likely to be reached soon.

Zhen Huan Elementary School All the teachers at Zhen Huan Elementary School on Xin Dagu Road, Chongqing Road, made a request to Principal Zhao Boqing on the 29th of last month due to the difficulty of maintaining their livelihoods: 1. A subsidy of 15 yuan per person for May and June. 2. The subsidy should be calculated for six months starting next semester. 3. Pay the contract fees before the final exam. The school only agreed to increase the subsidy by 20%, but ignored the rest. The teachers felt that the difference in conditions was too great and difficult to accept. The school then notified the teachers' introducers to individually terminate their employment midway, resulting in no classes being held at the school. The teachers are now petitioning the parties involved for assistance.

Le'an Elementary School The faculty and staff of the private Le'an Elementary School on Kangnaotuo Road, feeling the hardship of life, jointly submitted four requests to the school for assistance. It is reported that the two sides are negotiating sincerely and a solution is likely to be reached soon.

### China-West Table Tennis: Group B Finals This Weekend

In the China-West Cup Table Tennis Tournament, the Hualian Blue and White team played a women's league match against the Jewish team at the Jewish gymnasium the night before last. Hualian still used the same lineup as when they played against the Jewish team. Lin Jinlan was still exceptionally outstanding, scoring four points alone. Cai Xiuyu and Yan Wenjun also played skillfully. As a result, Hualian defeated the Blue and White team by a score of 13 to 4. All matches have been completed. In the end, they finished as the runner-up by a margin of two points. The Bureau has decided that the two strong teams in Group B, Hu Tong and Qingnian, have the same score, and will hold the final match this weekend at the auditorium of the Fifth China Vocational School on Nanjing Road. The defending champion of Group A, Huayi, still has two matches left against Qingyun and Youbang, and it has been decided to hold them earlier. The first match, Youbang vs. Qingyun, is scheduled to be held on Saturday. The second match, Huayi vs. Youbang, is scheduled to be held next Thursday. All matches will start at 7:30 PM.

### Guoqiang Middle School Basketball Tournament: Blue and White and Qiangxing Triumph

Yesterday was the anniversary of the founding of Guoqiang Middle School. The school authorities, considering the current extraordinary times, only held two basketball games as a embellishment in addition to the ceremony. The Guoqiang basketball court is spacious and shaded by green trees, with over a thousand spectators and orderly arrangements. At 4:00 PM, Lexing and Qiangxing took the stage. Qiangxing is composed of junior high school students from Guoqiang Middle School, who are short and nimble, lively and lovely, and their attacks and defenses are swift and clear. As a result, they defeated Lexing by a score of 57 to 38. In the final match, the Blue and White team played against Tongren. Tongren, due to incomplete team members, temporarily enlisted Qiu Xie from Xihua as an assistant. However, the team became a mismatched chariot, and the cooperation was diminished. The Blue and White team had strong players and horses, and Bao Songyuan, Wang Nanqun, and others were as agile as ever. The game became one-sided. In the first half, the Blue and White team won by a score of 39 to 22. In the second half, Tongren's Guanjia Jiang once launched a counterattack, posing a great threat to the Blue and White team. As a result, the Blue and White team was ultimately the better team, defeating Tongren by a score of 72 to 49.

### At a Loss?

— Shizi

Merchants use "Selling at a Loss" as an advertising trick, which we can often see in department store windows and at the entrance of silk shops. However, seeing a piece of paper with the words "Selling at a Loss" inserted on the counter of a rice store is truly unexpected, especially in this era when rice is as expensive as pearls. Rice merchants are actually willing to endure the pain of "Selling at a Loss," which is indeed "inconceivable."

Rice merchants can "Sell at a Loss," probably out of "sympathy for the people's hardship." Their "enthusiastic and chivalrous spirit" is truly "praiseworthy." Unfortunately, the price listed below the words "Selling at a Loss" on the paper is "102 yuan." Looking at the quality of the rice, it does not seem to be very good. Perhaps this rice has been "resting" in the rice warehouse for a long time. The selling price of Hong Kong rice is only 110 yuan, and the season for yellow plum is approaching, so it is thanks to the special favor of "rice weevils" on the citizens that the rice merchants generously "Sell at a Loss"!

We are not forgetful. Rice prices of 70 or 80 yuan were very recent. Buying at 70 or 80 yuan and selling at the high price of 103 yuan is still being beautifully touted as "Selling at a Loss." It's truly bewildering.

### Starting with "Corpses on the Road"

— Xu Daming

The following news item was published in various newspapers on the 29th of last month (May):

"Due to the threat of rising prices of all goods, the number of poor people starving to death in this city is increasing daily. According to a statement released by the Pushan Yizhuang, from the 1st to the 27th of this month, the Yizhuang collected and buried as many as 2,846 corpses in the public concession area, of which 2,250 were children's corpses and 596 were adult corpses."

However, this reflects the following points: First, the number of poor people in today's social system is undeniably and overwhelmingly large. Coupled with the sharp increase in the cost of living, the number of people starving and dying is also increasing proportionally. And there are countless others who have not died but are struggling with "death" today.

Of course, thorough salvation depends on our efforts to eliminate social injustice. Oppression of others, who are also human beings, and the irrational status quo must be eradicated. However, if someone like a certain capitalist insists on remaining stubborn and forces colleagues who want to sell their labor to earn a full meal onto the path of death and starvation, it will not be condoned by wise people!

Moreover, today, efforts should still be made to "reduce corpses on the road" and maintain social order.

Second, due to the root of hunger, diseases are also generated. This is also a social pathology that cannot be ignored. An article titled "Sending Doctors and Medicine" that I saw in this publication a few days ago further demonstrates the urgent need for this measure today. I hope that our concession authorities can find a way to address this issue as soon as possible. Otherwise, like the "famous doctors" of today, the life and death of patients are irrelevant to them unless money is sent to their door. Fortunately, they themselves are not dying! But the rulers of the concession probably cannot sit idly by and watch the poor die!

Third, there is an even more serious point in this news item, which is that among the 2,846 corpses, children's corpses account for as many as 2,250, accounting for more than 81%. Think about it, all countries in the world are encouraging childbirth and forcing marriage, but in China, in just one corner of Shanghai, such an alarming number appears. This cannot but make people sad, because it is a loss to the Chinese nation. We really should take urgent measures to address this.

If we think further, how many children in this number starved to death, died of illness, or even died unnaturally? But at most, the law only arrests their parents and punishes them, but the law has no way to guarantee their lives and cannot guarantee that their bellies will not be hungry!

Therefore, today, making sure that everyone has food to eat is the most important thing in the world!

### What I Saw and What I Thought

— Wang Pei

At the entrance of a certain Cantonese snack shop on Avenue Edward VII, there is a price list for "Special Sacrifices for the Anniversary" of the store. It is indeed very cheap. But in one corner of the list, it is written in small letters: "Due to soaring prices, each item will be temporarily increased by X cents." Seeing this, I couldn't help but smile wryly. It turns out that there is a condition for selling these "sacrifices": "each item will be increased by X cents"! Fortunately, I looked carefully, otherwise I would have been deceived by the cheap goods instead of getting a bargain.

"Military Prison." Zhao Si had obviously been there several times. Yuan Shaowen's sentence of sixteen months this time was indeed surprising to others, but he himself was most aware of the reasons. Fortunately, he was still an active soldier, and Yuan Baofan didn't really want to avenge Ji Zhaoxiong. He just blamed him for being too biased towards Begonia, and for him, he didn't hesitate to kill his own orderly. Therefore, he wanted him to suffer a little. But Shaowen was, after all, a brigade commander, and the crime he committed was not a major one. Therefore, although he lost his freedom of movement, his daily life was still quite comfortable. He wasn't really in prison at all, but just kept the warden company. At the same time, Yuan Baofan didn't want to make it too obvious on the surface, and he still sent his family to deliver food and meals to serve him every day.

Zhao Si led Yukun into the military prison, and without any difficulty, they met Shaowen in a reception room.

"Seventh Master, this time I've really troubled you!" Yukun said first, but he couldn't help but feel a little strange. He thought, how could he look like a prisoner in jail? Shaowen was lying lazily on a rattan chair.

"Someone specifically wants me to rest like this, so what's there to be troubled about?" When he said this, Yukun understood. "Are you just coming from Tianjin? How is Yuqin's wound?" "It's getting better," Yukun said, "He feels very sorry." Shaowen smiled bitterly. "I'm the one who feels sorry for him! He asked me to do something, but I didn't do anything well for him..." (123)

### On Employee Education

— Shi Wei

I remember that last year, the Ministry of Education in Chongqing passed a resolution on promoting supplementary education for employees. This resolution included the following clause: "The provinces and cities should, in important cities, increase the number of industrial and commercial vocational supplementary schools as much as possible, and should also work with industry leaders to organize industry supplementary education promotion committees, which should order major factories, companies, stores, and industry associations to establish vocational supplementary schools."

We believe that this resolution of the Ministry of Education is aimed at reality. Because the fact is that China's industry and commerce have always been backward. This of course includes social factors, but in addition, it should also be said that there is a lack of research and cultivation of technical issues. Under the goal of increasing production and national defense construction, it is imperative to widely promote supplementary education for employees and cultivate a large number of technical cadres in various industries.

In Shanghai, the increase in the number of vocational supplementary schools in recent years has been like bamboo shoots after rain. Many associations, amateur groups, companies, and shops have also responded. Taking the five major companies on Nanjing Road alone, three have supplementary classes. ... These all indicate that the issue of employee education has been widely noticed by people.

But this is only a quantitative development. If we measure it with a qualitative scale, it is still not satisfactory. This can be seen from the performance of various supplementary schools and other supplementary classes. For example, at first, the classrooms are always full of students, but as time goes on, they run away one by one. The problems in this are certainly very complicated, but the basic problem should be that the organizers cannot grasp the characteristics of employee education. Here, I will express some opinions within the scope of my limited knowledge, and I hope everyone will give me some advice.

(1) The first thing to be clear is that the pursuit of learning by employees is different from the pursuit of learning by general students. This is because employees are already producers in society, and they have the limitations of a professional environment. Therefore, conversely, to ask employees to study, they must also be given the conditions, time, and space to study. Specifically, on the one hand, learning should not hinder work, and on the other hand, work should not limit learning. If there are many apprentices who get up at 5:00 AM and go to bed at 12:00 AM, how can they find time to study? Therefore, I believe that various companies and shops should provide certain conveniences to employees who study within the possible scope.

(2) Precisely because employees are different from general students, the teaching methods can also be studied. The obvious characteristic is that employees are all in practice, and most of them have been away from school life for a long time. Therefore, the teaching methods in general schools, such as explaining from textbooks and reciting, cannot be applied to employees. Instead, we should cooperate more with their actual lives to improve their interest in learning and achieve the goal of learning for application. In this way, teachers for employees cannot be competent without being familiar with the life of the employee.

(3) In terms of teaching content, in addition to using practicality as the backbone, we should also put some materials that can inspire employees' national and ethnic concepts... For example, Chinese language cannot be completely equivalent to applied writing. It is best to choose some timely literary selections to change the taste so that they cannot feel bitter, dry, and tasteless.

(4) Collective learning has become the best learning method. Therefore, it can also be used for employees. It is best to have a certain amount of time for them to discuss and study together. This will greatly benefit their interest in learning and their effectiveness.

### Let Everyone Have Food to Eat

— Shi Qiuye

— One of the Realistic Problems

It's twelve o'clock, and the kitchen is especially busy. Rice is scooped up bucket by bucket, steaming hot, and dishes are arranged bowl by bowl, with both meat and vegetables. The cook is busy distributing them one by one, preparing to send them to the accounting room and the workshop.

Suddenly, six fabric mending female workers rushed into the kitchen, shouting and acting quickly. A bucket of rice and four bowls of dishes were taken away by them. The cook was stunned by this unexpected attack. When the accounting room reported to intervene in the fabric mending room, the rice and dishes had been devoured by them, leaving very little left. Their reason was: male workers have been given a raise, and the female workers in the yarn reeling room have also received the same treatment. But the fabric mending room had made the request early on, so why not give a satisfactory answer? If they are not given a wage increase now, then the factory should provide food.

The manager was not there, and the rice had already been eaten, so they had to postpone the discussion. After eating, they sent the leftovers down, with sly smiles on their faces.

The manager still hadn't returned, but time wouldn't wait for him, and it was already time for dinner. The cook, his soul just settling down, was afraid to start serving the meal, and went to the accounting room to ask for instructions. The accountant said: "Everyone will have to go hungry for a while. We can only start serving when the manager comes back!" However, the fabric mending female workers, because it was already dinner time, said that if they didn't start serving, they would do it themselves. They once again took advantage of the situation and rushed into the kitchen, lifting the pot to get the rice and opening the cupboard to get the dishes. The cook, hearing the news, rushed back to save the food, but the crowd of females was menacing, and two fists couldn't match four hands. What could he do? He had to let them go again.

The accounting room immediately mobilized everyone and ordered a crusade, and a fierce war of words unfolded. The female workers seemed to have been trained in advance. Two of them stood on the front line to fight, two others assisted on the left and right wings, and two others guarded the rice and dishes in the fabric mending room, responsible for defending the rear. The verbal battle did not yield any results, and the female workers returned to the fabric mending room to eat.

The next day, after further negotiations, they received the same treatment as the male workers. As a result, the act of grabbing food stopped.

A Retrospective Worth Revisiting

Since the prevalence of sound films, singing and film seem to have an inextricable connection. On the silver screen, they have long become a common interlude.

Singing and Dancing

Have a very close relationship with the film industry. In the past, the four great stars of the Bright Moon Society—

Wang Renmei, Li Lili, Xue Lingxian, and Hu Jia, all began their lives under the mercury lights. And today's red stars, Zhou Xuan, Bai Hong, Ying Yin, Gong Qiuxia, etc., are all transformed from singing and dancing troupe members into formal film actors. In the past, Chinese singing and dancing films included Poems on Banana Leaves, Fairy of the World, Three Stars Accompanying the Moon, and Fairy in Cloud Clothes.

Drama

And film are inherently sister arts, so stage staff and film workers help each other. For example, in the past, Jinshan, Wang Ying, Zhao Dan, Yuan Muzhi, etc., even took the same steps on these two artistic paths. After the war, this tendency became more intense. Those who have jumped from the stage to the screen and became famous include Tang Huaiqiu, Gu Yelu, Shu Shi, Zhou Qi, Zheng Zhong, Xia Xia, Lan Lan, He Bin, Huang He, Ding Zhi, Tu Guangqi, Sun Jinglu, Chen Qi, Murong Wan'er, Zhou Chu, and Xi Meng. Recently, there are also several active artists such as Han Fei, Shen Min, and Qiao Qi. As for stage plays adapted into films, there are Thunderstorm, Sunrise, Wilderness (Forest Feuds), Ge Nunnang, Li Xiangjun, Circuit Censor (Night of Revelry), Tragedy on the Lake (Female Ghost), Lust Demon, Camellia (Money Tree), New Melancholy (Flowers Bloom and Fall), and Women's Apartment. Now, "Flowers Splashing Tears," which is being produced by Jin Xing, and "Hong Xuanjiao," which is being prepared by Meicheng, are all works that have received the highest praise on stage. Not long ago, the play "Crossroads," performed by the Tianfeng Troupe, was adapted from a film into a stage play.

Peking Opera

The earliest to be put on the screen was Mei Lanfang's "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers." That was still in the early days of the germination of domestic films, and it was produced by the Guoguang Film Company, which was affiliated with the Commercial Press. Zhou Xinfang and Tan Fuying each played "Chopping Jing Tang" and "Si Lang Visits His Mother" on the screen. Xiao Jupeng and Shao Peng Huizhu once co-produced a "Mother Teaches Son." Other Peking Operas on the screen include "Five Flower Caves" (Four Pan Jinlian), "Zhou Yu Returns to Heaven," "Lin Chong Flees at Night," and the yet-to-be-released "Ancient Chinese Evening Song." Films adapted from Peking Opera include Beggar's Daughter (Hong Lixi), Sorrowful Autumn Rain (Linjiang Station), Biography of Heroes (Iron Bow Edge), Xue Yan Niang (A Handful of Snow), Su San's Amorous History (Jade Hall Spring), Wang Baochuan, and King of Chu, etc. Among the stars, Wang Xichun and Ning Xuan are both opera and film actors, and Yuan Meiyun, Tong Yuejuan, and Li Lihua were originally female opera singers.

Shanghai Opera

There have been two full-length films made of it, one is Virtuous Daughter-in-Law, and the other is It's Hard to Fill the Sea of Hatred, both starring Xiao Wenbin. Interspersed in the film is "A Singer Saves Her Mother," with Xiao Wenbin and Xiao Xiaoyuezhen singing "Than Begonia." Recently, the Shanghai Shanghai Opera Troupe's performances of improved Shanghai Opera at the Queen's Theatre are also very related to the film industry.

Drum Ballads

On the screen, Hu Die sang a "Daiyu's Sorrowful Autumn" in the film "Tears and Laughter," which was produced by the Mingxing Company. Art China's "Film City Record" also had drum ballads interspersed in it. But the formal appearance of drum ballads on the screen was Liu Baoquan's "Ning Wu Guan."

Comedy

Has also been on the screen. Wang Yuan and Jiang Xiaoxiao starred in "Going to Shanghai." Liu Chunshan, Jiang Xiaoxiao, Bao Lele, Sheng Daidai, Lu Qiqi, Lu Xixi, and Ding Fengying co-starred in "Chicken and Duck Couple." Zhang Yier, Zhou Kongkong, etc. have also shown their comedic talents on the screen. Qin Haha, who used to enjoy the reputation of Northern Comedy, changed his name to Qin Tong and became active in the film industry.

Bengbeng Opera

There was Zi Yushuang's "Begonia Red" on the screen; Yue Opera had Juexian and Tang Xueqing's "Song Stage Amorous History." The use of storytelling in film started with Jin Xing's "Fig" not long ago, with the interspersing of the opening "Mulan Ci," "Burying Jade," and "Remembering the Lyrics" as the first shot. Yue Opera has not yet been on the screen. As for the films that bring together Peking Opera, singing, dancing, and comedy, there was also a variety show film "Entertainment Conference."

### Symphony of Drama and Film

— Bai Ding

Now that realistic films are gaining popularity, it should be an opportunity for domestic films to get back on track. Unfortunately, there are no good original scripts, so they still tend towards low-level tastes. It is said that Guohua is planning to film "Black Cat" and "Phantom of the Old House," but judging from the titles, it is clear that the content will lean towards feudalism and superstition. We are not against making such films, but at least, the scriptwriters should inject a sense of justice that matches the times, so as not to fail the educational mission of film.

Although Cantonese films can be welcomed by Cantonese people in Shanghai, in principle, they still undermine the unification of the national language. Recently, after "Prince of Thieves," they will release "Empress Fengliu" starring Chen Yunshang. We hope that this will be "the last time."

The China Travel Drama Troupe, facing a shortage of scripts and feeling that historical dramas and Western dramas are also difficult to win over audiences, is preparing to send people to Hong Kong to find some new original scripts, because our country's famous playwrights such as Song Zhidi, Chen Baichen, You Jing, etc., are all in Hong Kong now!

Following "The Merry Widow," Li Qinian will simultaneously star in "Modern Youth" and "Thief Beauty." "Modern Youth" is written and directed by Ma Xuwibang, and "Thief Beauty" is still written by Ye Yifang, directed by Li Pingqian, and performed by the original cast.

Chapter 10 Gongsun’s Sword Qi Eliminates the First

Wang Yongtai smiled and said, "That's right, of course it's not a coincidence. Nephew, you are here cleaning up this pair of adulterers, but you don't know that my family's affairs tonight are very big and very many? Don't say you don't understand, I was also confused at first. Nephew, if you want to return the jade intact, why not come downstairs with me to meet someone, I wonder if you know him?" Xu Jing was even more confused by Wang Yongtai's words, and guessed that the process must be confusing and extraordinary. He might as well follow him to see who that person is, maybe it's the person who stole my Crimson Wind Sword. That person's skills are small, and it's good for me to get to know him. So he nodded and said, "Little nephew is eager to get back the sword, and is willing to go with Uncle to see that person. Wang Yongtai then said to the two people lying across the floor: "Let you live for a while, and see me come back to clean you up carefully." So he led Xu Jing downstairs. I saw that the lights were bright everywhere downstairs, and the family members were all up. Xu Jing followed Wang Yongtai to the study and saw a person sitting vaguely in the room, turning his back. Xu Jing felt a little suspicious when he looked at it, and when he stepped into the study, the person turned his face back. Xu Jing almost suspected it was a dream, and for a moment he was completely clueless, and couldn't help but exclaim, "Why is my brother also here? It's hard for my brother to understand." It turned out that the person sitting in the room was Liu Yinyang, the sworn brother in Weifeng Mountain. Wasn't this completely beyond Xu Jing's expectation? Liu Yinyang had also stood up and said with a smile, "Jing Ge, you have worked hard! Little brother respectfully returns the sword you lost." After saying this, he took the Scarlet Phoenix Sword from the chair beside him and offered it with both hands. Xu Jing took the sword, looked at it, and it was indeed his own sword, and he inserted it into the scabbard. He woke up in his heart, and thanked Liu Yinying, saying, "Thank you, brother, for returning the lost property, but I don't know if this sword was taken by brother, and deliberately teasing me? Also, I came here, and I didn't explain to my brother in advance, and I hope you will understand my little difficulties. And how did brother arrive here at the same time? And why did you meet my uncle first? Brother, can you tell me the details?" Wang Yongtai said with a smile, "I don't understand this matter very well, Nephew, you can sit down and talk with Liu Jun, and I will listen carefully. (80)

### An Outline of the Philosophy of Action

— Zong Yu

Within the human body, there is something that is eternally tireless, eternally aware, eternally young, and eternally healthy, and that is the spirit. I firmly believe that as science develops in the future, it may be possible to know the content and organization of the inner self, and what is now called spirit is also a kind of matter.
