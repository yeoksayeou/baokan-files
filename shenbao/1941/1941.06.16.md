### America Trending Towards the Brink of War: Freezing German and Italian Assets in the US; Five Occupied European Countries Also Included; All Property Transfers Controlled by Treasury Department

United Press International, Washington, 15th: President Roosevelt yesterday completely froze the funds of Germany and Italy in the United States. The freeze also applies to previously un-frozen funds of European countries occupied by Germany in the United States, including Albania, Austria, Danzig, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. White House Secretary O'Leary stated before the official announcement of the freeze that President Roosevelt had already frozen the funds of fourteen other European countries. The funds frozen by the United States yesterday amount to no less than $4,500,000,000. It is widely believed that this move is intended to prevent Axis funds from further flowing elsewhere through neutral parties. It has been widely rumored that German funds have already escaped into Latin America. Government sources reported that the German and Italian funds in the United States are in the range of $300,000,000 to $400,000,000. Since the government issued the freeze order, the Treasury Department has obtained absolute control over German and Italian funds and properties in the United States, including cash, bank deposits, claims, stocks, bonds, mortgages, ships, goods, trademarks, contracts, or accountings, especially the latter, which is Germany's greatest interest. The White House also issued a statement when issuing the order, saying, "Once these measures are implemented, the transfer of all German and Italian property interests will be subject to government control. Anyone who does not comply with this order will be subject to severe criminal penalties." The statement also stated, "This order is intended to prevent foreign countries from using funds in the United States for matters harmful to US national defense and other American interests, and to prevent funds in the United States that have been violently seized in Europe from being withdrawn and used for activities detrimental to the United States. In addition to the funds of Germany and Italy being ordered frozen, five additional countries have also been included." At the same time, President Roosevelt, in addition to signing the freeze order, also approved the regulations for registering the property of foreigners in the United States. This registration regulation will apply to all countries, including those whose funds have been frozen. Authorities issued a statement stating that control of accounting freezes will not be applied to Finland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Soviet Union for the time being. However, the government hopes that the governments of the aforementioned countries can provide sufficient guarantees that their countries and their people will not use their ordinary accounting rights to undermine this order, and that any applications for fund transfers made by these countries based on ordinary accounting should be reported and carefully investigated by the authorities. According to previous freeze orders, those affected were only Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Greece.

Reuters, Washington, 15th: According to the latest figures, the Axis assets in the United States that have been directly frozen are worth a total of $200 million.

International News Service, London, 15th: All Sunday newspapers carried the news of President Roosevelt's order to freeze Axis deposits in the United States on the front page with large headlines. The Sunday Express said, "The US Has Given Hitler a New Blow." The Sunday Express called President Roosevelt's actions "a prelude to war." The laying of mines in New York Harbor was also prominently featured in Sunday newspapers.

Italy Prepares to Retaliate Against the United States

Haitong News Agency, 15th: The Italian government has issued an order to investigate and estimate American assets in the country. Informed sources said that this is a prelude to the Italian government's intention to retaliate against the US government's freezing of German and Italian funds.

International News Service, Washington, 15th: According to the Justice Department's opinion, after the last World War, Germans in the United States established a complex system to control certain American industries and obtain rich profits. This is why President Roosevelt froze Axis assets in the United States, its purpose is to deal with this role of the Germans. Today, Justice Department officials said that the president's strict order has put the United States in "economic war with the Axis powers." It is said that all German-owned patents, international patent agreements controlled by Germans, are also included, and most financial revenue instruments will be subject to strict control thereafter. It is also said that German investment profits and royalty income in the United States amount to $15 million per year. Now this income has also been cut off, and the German high command will no longer be able to obtain information on the secret development of the American military industry. This is the first time in twenty-three years.

### US Treasury Secretary Calls on the Nation to Prepare for War: Better to Die Standing Than Live on Our Knees

Reuters, Amherst, Massachusetts, 15th: Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said yesterday at a dinner for the Amherst College alumni that if the American people are not prepared to fight to defend themselves, they cannot maintain their freedom. We must do something to eradicate the tyranny being carried out overseas, and temporarily risk losing our happiness or our lives. If we do not do so now, we will risk losing our freedom. Should we die standing, or live on our knees? It is up to us to decide.

### US Navy Department Announces: Mines Laid in New York Harbor; Training Nature, Not Real Defense

Havas Agency, Washington, 14th: According to an announcement by the Navy Department today, the entire sea surface in New York Bay, from Coney Island to the Sandy Hook Peninsula, a distance of 20 miles, will be laid with mines. It is reported that the shipping industry has been notified that the mine-laying date is approximately between June 15 and September 30, and the location of the water mines is roughly indicated. To prevent any eventuality, the mine-laying area will be constantly patrolled by the Navy.

Reuters, Washington, 15th: The Army Department, which is responsible for laying the mines, stated that the mine-laying in New York Harbor is a training exercise, not a plan to defend the harbor. In the past, mine-laying has been done for training purposes. The Navy Department's disclosure only caused concern because of the tense international situation. It is said that laying mines is originally the duty of the Navy, but American rivers and ports are under the jurisdiction of the Army.

Reuters, Washington, 15th: The US Navy Department yesterday disclosed its preparations to lay mines downstream in New York Harbor, which will be done this summer. It has not yet been stated whether it is only for training or for real defense. "The Washington Post" yesterday issued an inevitable demand for participation in the war, saying that if we are in a state of war, then we must act as if we are in a state of war, without concealment. Since Hitler has imposed his contempt for American policy on us, the time to resist Hitler has now arrived. Future actions must be taken by President Roosevelt, who has the title of marshal and is responsible for protecting American lives and property under the Constitution. At least he should instruct the Navy to search for and destroy Nazi submarines and privateers, who are wantonly harming American lives and property to diminish our maritime freedom. Hitler is now competing to control the Atlantic in order to embarrass the United Kingdom and seize control of the Western Hemisphere, but the President, in his fireside chat, has declared that the United States will actively resist any attempt by Hitler to seize maritime power. The Naval Hydrographic Office said that the sea line will extend from the mine-laying area to the Sandy Hook coast, and the mine-laying area will form a quadrilateral. Sandy Hook is two miles from the lighthouse and extends one thousand yards in one direction. This mine-laying area will be marked with four spherical buoys. Mines will be gradually placed from today until September 30, and the shipping industry should pay attention. After the armed mines are dropped, the area will be constantly patrolled. It is reported that last week the shipping industry received a warning from the Navy that it would conduct naval defense work in the ports of Los Angeles and San Diego. The Navy hinted that anti-submarine nets would be set up, but the official site did not comment on what work should be done.

### Welles Angrily Condemns Germany: Violates International Law; Germany Should Be Responsible for the Sinking of the American Ship; America Will Not Be Moved by Threats

Reuters, Washington, 15th: Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday told reporters about the torpedoing of the American ship "Robin Moor" in an emotional tone, saying that an American merchant ship engaged in peaceful commerce was tragically sunk in the Atlantic Ocean, and American citizens, including women and children, were forced to desperately board small lifeboats. This is greatly contrary to the provisions of international law, international ethical principles, and humanity. When reporters asked him to express the American attitude, Welles was unwilling to make a final statement without receiving a detailed report on the case. Welles discussed Berlin's threatening remarks that any ships carrying contraband to the United Kingdom must be sunk, saying that Americans are never moved by threats. This time, the "Robin Moor" was neither in a war zone nor carrying items prohibited by American law, yet it was sunk. Three-quarters of the crew and passengers died. As for the rumor that some of the rescued have arrived in Italy, the US ambassador to Italy has telegraphed to firmly deny this claim. Philip, the secretary of the US Embassy, who recently interrogated the crew of the "Robin Moor" in Pernambuco, has now gone to Para and will bring a detailed report and photos of the German submarine that sank the American ship, and fly to New York.

Reuters, Washington, 15th: After the American ship "Robin Moor" was torpedoed and sunk, yesterday there was support in Congress for the State Department's protest or request to Germany. Some argued that American ships should be armed to resist submarine attacks or air raids. The Navy Department has been secretly preparing for the need for a large number of guns and cannons for several months, so that merchant ships can be armed when a decision is made. In addition to newly manufactured guns, the United States has stored a large number of usable guns since the last World War.

### Japanese Ambassador to the US Visits Welles: Content of Talks Not Disclosed

United Press International, Washington, 15th: Undersecretary of State Welles met with Japanese Ambassador to the United States Admiral Nomura yesterday afternoon. Nomura said that his visit to the State Department was to express personal opinions and not to deliver any note from the Japanese government. However, Ambassador Nomura refused to disclose any specific content of his talks with Welles. Many observers believe that it may be related to the United States continuing to supply Japan with oil.

### Matsuoka Cables Italian Prime Minister: Reaffirms Loyalty to the Axis

United Press International, Rome, 15th: It was officially announced that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka cabled Mussolini to congratulate Italy on its recent military victories and reaffirmed his confidence in the Axis powers' establishment of a new world order. This document was delivered by the Italian ambassador to Tokyo.

### Thailand Refutes: Japanese Rumors

Reuters, Bangkok, 15th: Thai political circles have dismissed as absurd and malicious the reports in Japanese newspapers that Britain is trying to overthrow Thailand's current pro-Japanese cabinet. They said that the British authorities in Malaya have recently asked some Thai fugitives living in Louang, who have always opposed the current Thai regime, to move to a place further away from the Malayan-Thai border. It can be generally known that the British side has no intention of hostility towards the current Thai cabinet. It is reported that the Japanese newspapers have based their various rumors on the saying that five terrorists from Chongqing were arrested because they were involved in a plot to assassinate the Thai Prime Minister, but this has not been confirmed by responsible parties. Political circles here regret this attempt to create ill will between Britain and Thailand and between China and Thailand.

Reuters, Bangkok, 15th: Thai State Councilor Major Osananda told a Reuters reporter today that news from Tokyo listed his name with those of Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Thai political fugitives living in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, and said that he was plotting to overthrow the current Thai cabinet. He did not think it was worth criticizing, because this news was absurd and ridiculous.

### Dutch East Indies Government Submits Supplementary Budget to Parliament: For Expenses of Implementing Compulsory Military Service

### British Aid to China Society Prepares: Fourth Anniversary of China's War of Resistance; One Bowl of Rice Dinner Scheduled; Fundraising to Relieve Chinese Disaster Victims

Reuters, London, 15th: The Aid to China Society is currently preparing a large-scale commemoration of China's four years of resistance and nation-building, striving for freedom. Hundreds of thousands of pamphlets titled "Four Years of Resistance and Nation-Building" are being prepared, detailing the special progress of China in developing its original strength during the war, and a one-bowl-of-rice dinner will be held on July 7 to raise funds to relieve the Chinese people affected by the war. Dr. Koo Vi-kyuin, the Chinese ambassador to Britain stationed in Lisbon, will chair this grand event. Commemorative meetings will also be held everywhere on the same day to make the British public understand the work that China has undertaken and is currently undertaking in the common struggle to liberate the world from Axis slavery. Lord Lisdowne, chairman of the Aid to China Society, published an article in the Manchester Guardian, raising funds to relieve war disasters in China and awakening the British people to the importance of China's war effort as one of the three pillars of world freedom. It also stated that in the past few months, hundreds of people have followed the actions initiated by the Aid to China Society, and hundreds of schoolchildren have written prize-winning essays. The Aid to China Society has assisted in organizing an industrial organization to link the work of British aid with Chinese industrial cooperatives.

### Overseas Chinese in Sumatra: Support Dutch East Indies War Effort

Reuters, Batavia, 15th: Overseas Chinese in Sumatra held a meeting and decided to provide various forms of support to the Dutch East Indies government in the event of war.

### British Ship Sinks in the North Atlantic: All Crew Members Rescued

Reuters, Washington, 15th: The 46 crew members of the American cargo ship "Telesia" were rescued by the US Coast Guard cutter "Duane" in the North Atlantic, approximately 350 miles from Newfoundland. The Coast Guard authorities have just received a radio message from the "Duane" reporting the incident. It is said that they are currently carrying the rescued people to the port of St. John's, Newfoundland. The message included the phrase "Everyone is safe and sound, no one died." However, it did not mention what happened to the cargo ship. The "Telesia" was built in 1925, weighs 4,743 tons, and its registered port is London.

Editorial

### A New Stage in US-German Relations

The sinking of the Robin Moor has aroused very strong public opinion in the United States, and various retaliatory measures have been suggested, resembling the scene after the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915. However, the US government, even though its current position on the European war is far beyond the absolute neutrality of twenty-five years ago, has been very calm and cautious in this case. When the news first came, it tried to avoid being dominated by subjectivity and emotion, and calmly collected the facts about the sinking. So far, the facts have been clarified, not only confirming that the sinking of the Robin Moor was indeed done by a German submarine, but the German official statement on the 13th brazenly admitted this and even hinted that this type of unfortunate incident will continue to be replayed under the so-called reason of "contraband." If we compare the Nazi attitude towards the US at this time with the various explanations and guarantees made to the US in 1915, we can clearly see the seriousness of the current international situation, which is far beyond what could be compared when the Lusitania incident occurred.

On the eve of a war, there is usually a period of legal and moral debate, and the US and Germany are currently going through this process. The German side claimed that the sinking of the Robin Moor was because it was carrying "contraband," and that it was "contraband" because Britain had listed it as "contraband." Even if the claim is true, it can only be regarded as a very ridiculous reason, because the German side has no right to apply the British definition of "contraband" to American merchant ships and cargo. Although each country has its own different views on the so-called "contraband," according to the German explanation, it can indeed be proven that the ship was not carrying military supplies - and since neutrality has not been abolished, it is impossible for American ships to transport military supplies to Britain - moreover, the port of call, Cape Town, although a "British port," is not a war zone. To sink it near American territory is nothing more than a provocation against the US, and the anger of the Americans is naturally justified. The original international laws on naval warfare are almost ineffective in practical application. The Nazi authorities do not hesitate to easily tear up formal treaties that have been signed and are in effect, let alone international laws that lack binding force. Therefore, if the US protests to Germany, it will have no results, similar to this type of negotiation in history. In addition, the US has never recognized the Red Sea area as having been designated by Nazis as a war zone, and has begun to transport military supplies to the Near East. This is certainly another factor that could cause more disputes between the US and Germany.

In the past year, the hatred of the US for the Axis powers and its support for Britain have progressed in direct proportion to the tension in the European war. The German side knows this very well, so it stopped fantasizing about diplomatically easing the US long ago. On the other hand, its resentment towards the US is only vented through conspiracy and unbridled slander. As for actual hostile actions against the US, the Robin Moor incident can be regarded as the beginning. Of course, in order to contain US aid to Britain and participation in the war, Germany had already arranged for the third clause of the Tripartite Pact in the Pacific, but the objects it sought were not absolutely loyal to the alliance. And if the US were to go to war in the future because of responding to German provocations, the interpretation of the alliance's effectiveness would also require great effort. Hitler must also know these situations very well, so it is believable that Germany's sinking of the American ship was not intended to promote early US participation in the war, because that is not only not in the Axis's interest, but also the containment forces it has already deployed are unreliable. Its intention is probably not only to retaliate against the US for its deep disgust for totalitarianism and aggression, so as to avoid the loss of internal prestige caused by long-term forbearance, but also to launch an offensive targeting the weakness of the US's still immature war preparation and emotions, in order to contain Roosevelt's active steps in aiding Britain.

In recent days, although there have been some isolationist arguments and war-averse mentalities mixed in with the American sentiment, on the whole, there is only indignation and anger. The US Undersecretary of State's statement that Americans are not moved by threats is the best answer to Nazi atrocities. The first step the US authorities will take will probably be diplomatic means. The order to freeze all German and Italian funds in the US on the 14th, although unrelated to the sinking of the ship, can be considered a de facto response, and steps such as arming merchant ships and severely dealing with German submarines have long been in the works. Roosevelt's fireside chat a few days ago only mentioned guaranteeing the arrival of aid to Britain's war equipment and did not explicitly state what further means and methods would be adopted. If it is said that there are still some internal difficulties that have not been overcome, then this time Germany's piracy will undoubtedly help the US government eliminate some resistance, promote a sharper conflict between the US and Germany, and even engage in war. The sinking of a merchant ship, no matter how significant the repercussions, is not enough to constitute a reason for immediate participation in the war. Even in the last World War, participation in the war was implemented only after many American ships continued to be victims of unrestricted submarine warfare. But the impact of this incident on American society and even the psychology of the people may be more effective in deafening and awakening people than the loud calls of the American authorities, making Americans believe that at the very least they cannot help but engage in armed self-defense, and that war against the Nazis is finally unavoidable. Currently, Hitler's attention is focused on the Near East and northeastern Europe, but he will soon feel that the force from across the Atlantic is his greatest threat.

### 27 Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing, US Military Attaché's Office Destroyed, USS Tutuila Slightly Damaged, Foreign Residences on the South Bank Hit, Large Fires Along the Riverfront, Southern Yunnan Also Bombed

Chongqing - When Japanese bombers brutally bombed Chongqing today, the new office of the US Military Attaché and buildings constructed with US Red Cross funds were destroyed. A US gunboat and a US Navy bar also sustained minor damage. The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, Gauss, inspected the damage with embassy staff and noted that bombs fell within 100 yards of the US Embassy, an area known as a "safe zone" on the south bank of the Yangtze. (Fess, Associated Press Special Correspondent, 15th)

Chongqing - This afternoon, 27 Japanese planes raided here. The office of US Embassy Military Attaché Meyer was hit by a bomb, and several bombs landed within 75 yards of where the US gunboat Tutuila was docked. The ship was not damaged. Bombs rained down along the Yangtze River, mostly falling into the river and on the south bank near the US Embassy. The International Club took a direct hit, and half of the building was destroyed. Several foreign residences on the south bank were hit, causing large fires along the riverside avenue. (Reuters, 15th)

Chongqing - This afternoon, 27 Japanese planes carried out massacres and destruction in Chongqing's commercial and impoverished residential areas. Two special buildings built with funds from the American Red Cross under the "Housing Project" were also destroyed along with the homes in the impoverished residential area. At least four bombs fell within the "safe zone" on the south bank of the Yangtze River. These four bombs all exploded within 150 yards of the US gunboat Tutuila, but the ship only sustained minor damage. One bomb exploded within a few feet of the new office of the US Military Attaché. The US Military Attaché's office was located midway between where the Tutuila was docked and the US Embassy, and the Tutuila was less than 300 yards from the US Embassy. Thirty Chinese people standing at the entrance of a crudely built air raid shelter were killed. No foreigners were killed or injured. I stood on a small hilltop on the south bank and witnessed these 27 bombers, at 15,000 feet, arrayed in a line like slow-flying mosquitoes. Then the bombs fell, sounding like tearing paper, and the entire north bank opposite the US Embassy was filled with dust and smoke. The intense shaking caused us to step back. I and the other onlookers were standing about 1,000 yards away. The reporter then heard a huge explosion, turned and looked, and saw thick smoke erupting on the south bank of the Yangtze River, between the US Embassy and the Tutuila, with dust flying everywhere. The lower city of Chongqing was shrouded in smoke and dust. In addition to evidence of incendiary bombs, there were raging flames in the bombed areas. Several ships in the river were destroyed. Some of the boatmen on the bombed ships survived, while others were filled with corpses. Four bombs fell within a 150-yard radius of the Tutuila. Another bomb fell on the hillside near the new office of the US Military Attaché. The office was almost completely destroyed. The bomb exploded at the entrance of an air raid shelter, killing about 30 Chinese people. US Ambassador Gauss and embassy staff investigated the damage after the air raid alert was lifted. The windows of the US Embassy were shattered, and the plaster on the walls was loosened. The US Navy bar also suffered severe tremors, and the plaster on the walls was almost completely peeled off. The Tutuila suffered minor shrapnel damage, and some glass windows were shattered. The Italian Embassy also suffered minor damage. Anti-aircraft guns were quite active, but the bombers were flying very high, beyond their range. About 400 shops and houses were destroyed in the bustling areas of the city, including several public apartments built by the American Red Cross. Apart from the air raid shelters on the south bank, there were few deaths caused by the air raid. An estimated 40 people were taken to hospitals. It was reported that several air raid wardens were also killed, and there were several fires, but they were quickly extinguished. Shops on both ends of the bombed area resumed business within 15 minutes of the alert being lifted. After the bombers flew away, I inspected the destroyed office of the Military Attaché and then went down the river to inspect the Tutuila. The officers and men of the ship had already landed. A sailor said that a bomb that fell within 75 yards of the ship caused the stern of the ship to jump three feet. Another bomb landed on the shore, showering the ship with sand and gravel. A piece of shrapnel hit the ship, shattering windows and pottery, and damaging curtains. The only person injured was electrician Louis, who suffered a severe abrasion on his hand. (Associated Press, 15th)

Chongqing - 27 Japanese planes again attacked Chongqing on the 15th, entering the city's airspace at around 1 PM and dropping over a hundred bombs.

### Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Launch Multi-pronged Attack on Huaian City, Both Buzha and Banzha Towns in Northern Huaihe Recovered, Chinese and Japanese Forces Confronting Each Other Under Huaian City

Somewhere in Northern Jiangsu - Chinese troops southeast of Huaian in Northern Jiangsu launched a two-pronged attack on Huaian City on the evening of the 5th. One route bypassed and occupied Buzha Town and Banzha Town north of Huaian, cutting off the connection between Huaian and Huaiyin. The other route vigorously attacked Huaian, immediately occupying the new city and the walled city of Huaian. At noon on the 6th, Japanese troops in Huaian City, feeling isolated and without reinforcements, exited the west gate and retreated towards Huaiyin. They were ambushed by Chinese troops at Banzha, suffering heavy casualties and several destroyed vehicles. The Japanese then fled back to Huaian City and held it under siege.

### Over a Hundred Japanese Warships Concentrated off the Coast of Zhejiang, Some Moving South, Aiming to Threaten India and the Dutch East Indies

Chongqing - According to reliable sources received here, over a hundred Japanese warships are currently concentrated off the coast of Zhejiang Province, including transport ships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers. Some of them are moving south. Because the concentration of such a large number of warships is definitely not directed at China, people here believe that Japan will soon undertake a large-scale operation in the South Pacific, and that at the very least, Japan will again exert strong pressure on the Dutch East Indies, as negotiations between the two countries have apparently broken down. (Reuters, 5th)

### Sweden Lays Mines in Territorial Waters to Prevent Germany, Entire Garrison of Gotland Mobilized, German Transport Ships Have Sailed North

Associated Press, Stockholm, Sweden, 15th - It was learned yesterday that due to the large-scale troop movements of Germany in Scandinavia, Sweden has laid mines in its sea to prevent accidents, and has mobilized troops on Gotland Island. A report from Norway stated that German troops have spread mines and set up other defenses on the Norwegian coast in the past few days, apparently preparing for military operations in the near future. It is reported that the German army has cut off the waterway traffic outside Stavanger and Igan Strait in Norway. From today onwards, all ships heading to and from Stavanger Island are prohibited. The German army has also confiscated countless Norwegian ships in the past few weeks, while intensifying control over land traffic in southern and northwestern Norway. In addition, 310 farmland in Kristiansand Island have been confiscated by the German army for the construction of airfields. A Swede from Gotland to Stockholm stated that German transport ships, each batch of 25 ships, sailed north on June 6th, 8th, and 9th. On June 12th, a large number of transport ships sailed south. These ships all sailed within Swedish territorial waters. Outside Kanius Island, several German warships telegraphed local officials in Gotland on the nights of June 6th and 7th, requesting to enter Weixinbei Port, but were refused. The next day, Swedish patrol ships found that mines had been laid in the sea outside the port. On June 6th, at least 32 German planes flew to southern Gotland. Afterwards, Soviet planes also frequently flew over. The mobilization of Gotland is almost complete. (The telephone line to Stockholm was cut off at this point in the report.)

### British Troops in Tobruk Gain Minor Victory

Reuters, Cairo, 15th - Military officials here said that the British troops in the Tobruk area had gained a victory, which could strengthen the British defenses, but its importance should not be exaggerated, as it was only a local battle aimed at widening the positions of the British troops in the area. There are mobile battles in the western desert, and British troops have won several minor victories.

### Italian Planes Bomb Gibraltar for the Second Time

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 15th - The air raid on Gibraltar mentioned in yesterday's Italian military report was the first attack by the Italian Air Force on the British naval base this year. The first was on the 6th of this month. Military officials here believe that this move can be seen as a symbol of intensifying attacks on British bases in the eastern and western Mediterranean. Since the end of the Balkan War, after the German and Italian troops occupied Crete, the Axis air force can freely move in the central Mediterranean to attack British bases in the east and west. According to the "Lavolov Report" from Ahsiel, the military authorities in Gibraltar not only expected the area to be subjected to air raids from time to time, but also the possibility of paratroopers landing in the area in the near future. It is reported that the United Kingdom is now engaged in special air defense training, shooting balloons dropped from aircraft.

### Rumors of Heavy Troop Concentrations on the German-Soviet Border, German Troops Withdraw from Greece and Crete, Concentrating on the Romanian Border in Moldavia

Associated Press, Istanbul, Turkey, 15th - A senior Turkish leader, after completing a Balkan inspection yesterday, confirmed that German troops had withdrawn from Greece, Crete, and Bulgaria. He also said that these troops are currently concentrated in Moldavia in Romania and other points in the Soviet border territories under German control. It is claimed in this regard that Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu has also mobilized all Romanian reserve forces. This measure of Romania, with a large number of troops, has led to a shortage of labor and is also the cause of reduced food production and distribution.

Haitong News Agency, Rome, 15th - The newly appointed Soviet Deputy Representative to Romania, Kogitikov, arrived here yesterday from Moscow. Soviet Ambassador to Rome, Laurentiev, will leave here and return to Moscow in the near future.

Havas, Bucharest, Romania, 15th - It has been rumored that the Soviet Minister to Romania, Lavrentiev, has been recalled to the country. Soviet officials here have solemnly denied this, saying that the current situation is extremely delicate, and Lavrentiev is well-versed and able to cope with it, and the Soviet government will not suddenly make any changes.

Reuters, Ankara, 15th - The mutual deployment of heavy troops on the Soviet-German border is regarded by many well-informed people in Turkey as a bluffing action to gain a better position in the negotiations. However, there are also some who hold a more serious view, believing that the Soviet Union is deeply disturbed by the current situation and has turned Bessarabia into a large military camp, placing mines and obstacles to prevent tanks from advancing on all roads leading to the border. Goring's statement that Germany needs Ukraine for a long-term war against Britain has not been forgotten by the Soviet Union. It is believed that Germany must have made demands on the Soviet Union for joint control of Ukraine and participation in Soviet industry, which Stalin would find very difficult to accept. It is said that half of it is to suppress the instability caused by food shortages, and half is related to Germany allowing Romania to return Bessarabia. It is said that General Antonescu has therefore obtained the cooperation of many Romanian leaders. It is believed that General Antonescu's recent trip to Berlin was for this matter. It is known that the reason for the food panic in Romania is partly due to the need to supply ample food to the huge German army stationed in Romania for military use. The Turkish leader also said that the new road for Romania to mobilize Slovakia towards the Soviet Union has now been built, and the order to prepare air raid shelters in Romania around June 15 has also been issued. Some people in Turkey have another view, believing that the German and Soviet troops on the border are the prelude to the establishment of a broad political and military agreement that will affect the Middle East. The possibility of the Soviet Union and Germany jointly establishing a new order in Europe is also expected. Although Turkish people have this different kind of concept, they all expect that there will be very important developments in the short term.

International News Agency, London, 15th - According to today's report in the Sunday Express, after a 40-hour meeting, Stalin and his military leaders have accepted the German request for close economic cooperation. According to the report, because military leaders told Stalin that the Soviet Union is currently unable to cope with Hitler's war machine, Stalin has decided to accept it. Negotiations are reportedly being held in Moscow to discuss the Soviet counter-proposals to Germany's demands. It is expected that a new agreement will be signed this week. Soviet officials deny that the Soviet-German situation is tense, and deny that Germany has made a request to the Soviet Union for further economic cooperation. The Sunday Express dismisses this as a political tactic.

### Hess Threatens Britain, If They Do Not Accept Peace Terms, They Will Conclude an Alliance with the Soviet Union

United Press of America, Glasgow, 15th - Glasgow Mayor Dowd Guan spoke at the Arms Week meeting last night. Nazi Party leader Hess had told British officials that if Britain did not accept the Axis peace terms, Germany would conclude a military alliance with the Soviet Union. Dowland said last week that Hess came to Britain with peace terms, hoping to return to Britain after discussing them with Scottish dignitaries.

### Croatia Joins the Axis Pact, Signs in Venice, Another Act of a Puppet Show

Reuters, London, 15th - Swiss Radio said that the puppet state of Croatia is about to join the Axis alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. This is probably one of the main reasons for the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Venice. The German Foreign Minister arrived in Venice last night. According to the German News Agency, the diplomatic authorities of Germany and Italy met last night. Kulin Bavaria, the head of Kroit, left Zagreb for Venice yesterday, accompanied by the Minister of Land and the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Haitong News Agency, Venice, 15th - The head of Croatia, Bavaria, signed a protocol here at the Doge's Palace this morning, announcing Croatia's participation in the Tripartite Pact. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Japanese Ambassador to Italy Hori, Hungarian Minister Tavilano, Romanian Minister Vukin, Bulgarian Minister Kardev, and Slovakian Minister Galfanak were all present.

### French Ships Sail Out of Toulon, Vichy Denies

Reuters, London, 15th - According to Swiss Radio last night, the Vichy government has formally denied that the French fleet has sailed out of Toulon.

### Syrian French Troops Retreat, British Force on the Outskirts of Damascus, Roads and Bridges Are Destroyed, British Air Force Assists Warships

Associated Press, London, 15th - According to sources yesterday, Syrian French troops have withdrawn from Kiswe and roads a few miles from Damascus. British troops have now occupied Nabata.

Reuters, Cairo, 15th - The latest reports from the Syrian battlefield say that the Allied forces are still advancing slowly in Syria because they sometimes encounter resistance and sometimes the roads are destroyed, preventing rapid advance. According to military officials, the Allied forces are very close to Saida. Apart from the above news, there is no information here about the current situation.

Associated Press, Cairo, 15th - Headquarters announced that the Allied forces are currently in contact with the Vichy forces on the entire Syrian front line, and the Allied forces in the central area have made new achievements yesterday.

Reuters, London, 15th - The Free French Headquarters here received a telegram from Jerusalem stating that the Free French Army's entry into Damascus will be realized soon. Allied troops are stepping up their attack on Sidon, but at the same time minimizing casualties. Reuters asked the Cairo correspondent to report that the Allied forces entered Syria in five routes, making continuous progress and striving to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Currently, the British authorities have allowed merchants from Lebanon and Syria to enter Palestine and purchase gasoline in various places, and especially allow them to transport wheat, flour, white sugar, coffee, and kerosene to the areas occupied by the Allied forces in Syria. According to the Beirut Vichy News Agency, Syrian French Affairs Officer Dunz issued an order instructing all officials not to leave their posts unless ordered by their superiors. Currently, gendarmes and police patrol the streets of Damascus and Beirut at night to prevent disturbances. At the same time, civilians continue to evacuate, and a large number have left the country. Announcements have been issued in Damascus and Beirut, urging residents to remain calm.

Reuters, Cairo, 15th - According to news from Jerusalem, a military spokesman there stated that after the Allied forces occupied Mgarong, they divided their troops into two routes, one to the northwest and one to the northeast, continuing to advance. The pressure around Damascus is currently intensifying. According to a correspondent traveling with the army, there was no resistance in Mgarong. The British army's advance was only hampered by the retreating Vichy troops blowing up the bridges. Residents seemed very welcoming to the Allied forces' entry.

Havas World News Agency, Vichy, 14th - Military observers here recently stated that it has been seven days since the British troops and the de Gaulle troops invaded the two states of Syria and Lebanon. Although they have continuously launched fierce attacks on our army's positions in various places, the important cities are still in our army's hands. The enemy troops who crossed the Oran Plain and attacked the city of Damascus were blocked by our army outside the city of Qisu and are currently 12 miles away from the city of Damascus. As for the enemy troops attacking the city of Beirut, they are Australian Commonwealth troops who attacked our army's positions under the cover of the British fleet. Although they once broke into the city of Sidon, they have been repelled and are 30 miles away from the city of Beirut. However, the British navy has strong strength, and there will be some developments in the next few days. However, in any case, the operational plan decided by the British government has been hit.

Associated Press, Beirut, 15th - A French military report stated that the joint attack on the city of Sidon by the British infantry and tank army has been repelled by the French army. Although the British navy bombarded fiercely, the French army still defended its position. French planes bombed the British tank convoys south of Sidon and directly hit them. A British twin-engine plane was shot down. The French air force and navy cooperated very closely. The city of Beirut is calm. There is a possibility that it may be occupied by the Allied forces. Only a quarter of the people in the city have evacuated. Syrian Administrative Officer Dunz ordered all gendarmes and police to remain in place.

Reuters, Cairo, 15th - A British Air Force bulletin in the Middle East stated that the British and Australian air forces continued to provide air support to the Allied forces in Syria and to British ships patrolling the Syrian coast.

### England and France Exchange Documents Regarding Syria; France Expresses Extreme Indignation at British Actions

Havas World Telegraph Agency, Vichy, 14th: The documents exchanged between England and France regarding the Syrian affair have been made public. The French Information Agency has also issued a statement commenting on them, stating that the British note declared that if the French government itself took or allowed others to take any action that infringed upon British interests, then Britain would take aggressive action in response. The British side, based on rumors spread by some newspapers and radio stations, namely the so-called rumors that the enemy had infiltrated Syria, believed that it had the right to attack Syria. This kind of action, which is purely premised on its own interests, disregards the plight of the local people, and arbitrarily expands the war, is something that no country can tolerate. Moreover, when Britain launched the invasion, it also admitted that there were no German or Italian elements in Syria, which shows that its actions are even more unreasonable. The British government also requested that General Pétain instruct the French garrison in Syria not to resist British military actions. The French government is very indignant at this proposal and has resolutely rejected it. The French army has a responsibility to defend the territory in Syria, and no one can ask it to abandon its duties. If the British government really intends to end the bloodshed, it should immediately admit that the claim that German troops have entered Syria is a misunderstanding and resolutely withdraw its troops. In short, the solution to the problem still requires the British to resolve it themselves.

Reuters, Vichy, 15th: The Vichy News Agency stated that the British side recently sent a note to the French government proposing that a ceasefire by the French forces in Syria would be beneficial to both countries. The French government has rejected this proposal. The British note stated that the Vichy government should order its troops stationed in Syria not to resist the measures taken by the Allied forces to prevent the German side from using Syria as a base of operations.

### Turkey Still Suspicious and Fearful of Germany; Vigilance Remains Unrelenting

Reuters, Ankara, 15th: The Turkish News Agency's Berlin correspondent reported that Germany has assured Turkey that it need not fear the Axis powers. People have different opinions on this statement. Turkey is certainly happy to hear that Germany has no malice towards Turkey and supports Turkey's policies, but it is deeply disturbed by Germany's repeated declarations of its intentions, so they are speculating whether this is a prelude to Germany making economic demands, or part of the intimidation tactics against the Soviet Union. If a conflict occurs between the Soviet Union and Germany, Turkey's position has been guaranteed by the recent Soviet-Turkish mutual guarantee agreement, which has consolidated the previously established non-aggression pact. Germany is well aware of this, but some people say that Germany sincerely declared German-Turkish friendship in order to improve its position vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. At the same time, Turkey is still carrying out its defense preparations without the slightest懈怠.

### Red Army Exercises in Moscow and Kyiv

Reuters, London, 15th: Swiss Radio reported that the Soviet Union is currently conducting extensive exercises, such as parachute and tank drills. The exercise locations are in the Moscow area and the Kyiv region.

### Report of Tegol's Injury Proved Inaccurate; The Injured Person Was Someone Else

Reuters, London, 15th: According to a correction from the Free French News Agency in Damascus, the person injured by the bombing by an aircraft bearing the tricolor flag was General Rigan-Tierholm of the Free French Army. The report that the leader of the Free French Army, Tegol, was injured is inaccurate. Ri is currently leading the Free French Army forward in Syria. He formerly served as the Governor of Djibouti and was one of the earliest French generals to publicly oppose the armistice with Germany. Ri is young and well-known in East Africa.

### British Navy Sinks German Supply Ship

United Press, London, 14th: According to the Admiralty, a supply ship for the German battleship Bismarck has been sunk by the British Navy. This is the sixth German supply ship sunk recently. In addition, another armed fishing boat was sunk. It was also announced that British submarines in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas recently sank eight Axis ships and severely damaged two others. The attack locations included not only the sea but also Axis ports. An Italian convoy, including one fast ship and one armed fishing boat, was sunk by British submarines using artillery fire. Another submarine torpedoed and sank an 8,000-ton transport ship. The Italian oil tanker Sianbo, 5,232 tons, is said to have arrived at Istanbul with severe damage from a British submarine torpedo. Another submarine sank a fully loaded 1,000-ton supply ship in the Italian port of Randusa Island.

### Spanish Army and Air Force Hold Exercises

Reuters, Madrid, 15th: The Spanish Minister of the Army, accompanied by several senior officers and some foreign military attachés, inspected the exercises of the Thirteenth Division north of Madrid yesterday. Troops carrying flamethrowers and automatic weapons also participated in the performance. The attacking side was assisted by a squadron of air force dive bombers.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 15th: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman declared yesterday that all speculations commenting on other countries' attitudes towards Spain are superfluous. Spain's attitude towards Germany and Italy has been clearly expressed.

### Dutch Minister of Defense's Resignation Approved

United Press, London, 15th: The Queen of the Netherlands has approved the resignation of the Dutch Minister of Defense, Dixhoorn, and has appointed Interior Minister Baozhen as Acting Minister of Defense. The official appointment will be made after Foreign Minister Kleffens returns.

### Turkey Cracks Down on Smuggling; Soviet Ships Detained

### On the Special Reserve for Industrial and Commercial Deposits

— Wang Wennan

In recent years, one of the main reasons why general industrial and commercial enterprises have been able to obtain huge profits is nothing more than the currency value fluctuations and the surge in inventory prices. Therefore, at the end of each year's final accounts, astonishing profits can be concluded on the books, but in reality, most of them are virtual values on the books, not real wealth. When prices return to normal in the future, general industrial and commercial enterprises will inevitably suffer losses from falling inventory prices because they must maintain a regular amount of inventory to meet their operational needs. Will the so-called surplus today not still be equal to zero in the future? If, today, this type of surplus from rising inventory prices is still distributed as dividends according to normal methods, once prices fall, losses will inevitably occur, and the dividends that have already been distributed cannot be recovered. The impact will inevitably involve the business itself. Although the company has regulations to withdraw one-tenth of the surplus as a public reserve fund, the amount is limited and not sufficient to meet the needs of future compensation. Therefore, in order to maintain industrial and commercial industries and prepare for future revival, the government has specially formulated the "Methods for Special Reserves for Industrial and Commercial Deposits in Extraordinary Times," which are divided into eight items. They have been approved by the Executive Yuan and announced and implemented on April 14 of this year. All general public organizations must abide by and implement them from this year onwards. I will now express my humble views on the content of the measures as follows:

(1) Special Reserve Withdrawal Methods According to the provisions of Article 2 of the Special Reserve Methods, when industrial and commercial enterprises organized as companies have a surplus at the end of each business year, in addition to the provisions for withdrawing public reserve funds in accordance with laws and regulations, they shall withdraw special reserves in accordance with the following provisions.

1. If the surplus exceeds one-fifth of the total paid-up capital, withdraw 10% of the surplus.

2. If the surplus exceeds one-fourth of the total paid-up capital, withdraw 20% of the surplus.

3. If the surplus exceeds one-third of the total paid-up capital, withdraw 30% of the surplus.

As mentioned above, the so-called industrial and commercial enterprises organized as companies refer to companies that have been registered with the government and approved for establishment. They must all abide by the various provisions of these methods. Suppose a certain limited liability company has a total paid-up capital of 100,000 yuan. The operating results for this year show a surplus of 21,000 yuan, which exceeds one-fifth of the total capital. According to the provisions of the first item above, in addition to the legal public reserve of 2,100 yuan, a special reserve of 10%, or 2,100 yuan, must also be withdrawn. From the above example, it can be seen that if the annual surplus of a general company-organized enterprise exceeds 20% of the total paid-up capital, it must withdraw a special reserve in addition to the legal public reserve to prevent future price fluctuations and use it to compensate for unexpected losses.

(2) Special Funds for Storage and Periodic Reporting This special reserve is stipulated to be stored in banks in special funds so that the authorities can check it at any time. We must withdraw the full amount. At the same time, it is stipulated that one month after the end of each business year, the business report, balance sheet, property catalog, and profit and loss statement should be submitted to the competent authorities and reported to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record. However, the Shanghai municipal administrative authorities are temporarily closed. Before they are restored to their original state, industrial and commercial enterprises in this city may directly report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to speed up the process.

(3) Provisions for Taxation and Use The special reserve is stipulated to not be exempt from tax. Therefore, when general company-organized enterprises pay the profit tax and excess profit tax, this reserve should still be included in the calculation of the tax payable and not deducted to avoid affecting government tax revenue. For its use, it is stipulated that it may not be arbitrarily distributed without the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, except for compensating for unexpected losses.

(4) Penalties for Violating Various Regulations Anyone who violates the various provisions of these methods, fails to withdraw the special reserve in full, or makes false reports, may, after investigation, be fined up to 1,000 yuan for the company's practicing shareholders, promoters, directors, and supervisors in accordance with the provisions of Article 232 of the Company Law.

The purpose of the government in formulating these methods is entirely for the benefit of industrial and commercial enterprises themselves, deeply instructing all industries not to be deceived by the current abnormal prosperity and to slightly consolidate the foundation of the business. For the sake of preparing for a rainy day, sufficient reserves should be withdrawn to be used as compensation for unexpected losses when prices fall in the future. This shows the government's far-sightedness. It is hoped that industrial and commercial enterprises organized as companies will understand the government's intention to maintain them, lead all industries to strictly comply, and that it is of utmost importance to prepare for the revival of industry.

### Soviet Foreign Trade Organizations

Although cargo ships on the Pacific Ocean are still very busy, the Shanghai market, which is supported by imported goods, is already worried about the day when these cargo ships stop coming to Shanghai. Everyone holds a contradictory emotion: that is, without the United States joining the war, world peace will not be easily restored. However, if the United States joins the war, Shanghai's life will not be easy. At that time, there will be too many and too serious reasons why life will not be easy. The interruption of imported goods is also very distressing.

Even so, everyone is not without self-consolation. Everyone believes in the local saying that "the boat will naturally go straight when it reaches the bridge," and some people are concretely conceiving that the Soviet Union may be the supporter of Shanghai's situation at that time. Although the Soviet Union may not be willing to carry this wet wood, and the Soviet Union will sooner or later be drawn into the whirlpool. More importantly, where does Stalin's heart lie, on the right side? Or leaning to the left? If it leans to the right, Shanghai will be finished anyway. But no matter what, Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles seem to be waiting for the arrival of Soviet products. And Soviet products also seem to intend to reach this big market in the Far East. Recently, Soviet merchants and brokers close to Soviet merchants in Shanghai have been very active. This is a completely new attitude. The Soviet-Chinese Trade Company has already opened, but it is in Hongkou, which is desirable but unattainable. It is said that there is also a more powerful Lianhua Foreign Company in preparation, located in the French Concession, surrounded by broker organizations such as Lihua Trading Company and Sida Foreign Company.

However, the Soviet Union's foreign trade is state-owned and planned. His plan is completely based on his own principles, and the needs of foreign markets are not in his plan. Therefore, what Shanghai needs may not be what he has, and what he can supply may not be what Shanghai wants. Also, because his exports were originally the discharge of excess domestic production, he neither pays attention to packaging nor standardizes the weight units of the packaging. When commercial disputes arise due to non-compliance with delivery standards, one party to the dispute is a merchant, and the other party is a Soviet government agency. The arbitration and the effect of the arbitration both raise questions. Therefore, although Soviet merchants in Shanghai are currently very active, steady friends are still hesitant.

In addition to these practical problems, what makes people more difficult is the fundamental lack of understanding of the Soviet trade system. Everyone has long known that it is state-owned, but they do not know how it is state-owned? And the above-mentioned so-called practical problems actually arise from a fundamental lack of understanding.

The Soviet Union's foreign trade is under the highest authority of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade. It was not until 1930 that it separated from the People's Commissariat for Domestic Trade and operated independently. The reason why it separated from domestic trade was actually the beginning of attention to international competition. The main functions of the department are four: (1) establishing trade policies; (2) implementing the above policies; (3) handling tariff affairs; (4) organizing foreign trade management agencies. Therefore, various specialized agencies are set up within the department. The main ones include the State Administration Bureau, the Planning Bureau, the Trade Policy Bureau, the Taxation Bureau, the Export Bureau, the Import Bureau, the Exchange Bureau, the Foreign Trade Loss Prevention Bureau, the Rationalization Bureau, and the National Supervision Bureau for Export Commodity Quality. As of June 1940, the Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Trade was Mikoyan, the Vice-Chairman was Kaurchikov, and the Trade People's Commissar was Stepanov, among others. The department has commissioners in each federal autonomous republic, and in foreign countries, it represents the department in the name of "Trade Representative Office" to perform supervisory and command duties. This "Commercial Representative Office" can be said to be a branch of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade, and it can also serve as a type of Soviet diplomatic agency, performing the functions of negotiating and signing commercial treaties. Therefore, it is composed of two parts. One part is dedicated to general affairs and is responsible for supervising the other part and other relevant agencies. The other part is dedicated to the actual business of import and export. The Soviet Union currently has commercial representative offices in:

London, England; Vienna, Austria; Berlin, Germany; Copenhagen, Denmark; Salerno, Italy; Warsaw, Poland; Istanbul, Turkey; Stockholm, Sweden; Oslo, Norway; Tehran, Persia; Athens, Greece; Mai Mai Cheng, Outer Mongolia; Paris, France; Tokyo, Japan

In addition, there are specialized trading companies in England, the United States, and Argentina; for trade with the Far East, there are also special trade agencies. At the same time, various specialized agencies are established according to commodity categories. Below, we will list the names of the commodities that each agency is responsible for managing, but the names of the agencies are too long, so they are indicated by numbers.

Export Agencies and the Export Products They are Responsible for Managing

Type 1: Automobiles

Type 2: Linen, flax yarn

### Cotton Market News and Knowledge

— Lecture by Mr. Zhang Yifan, Recorded by Feng Zhida

—Commercial News Textbook for the Business School of Shanghai University—

The world's cotton production is about 100 million dan or more per year. The United States produces the most, followed by India, and China ranks third with an annual production of more than 10 million dan.

Cotton Producing Areas: China has a very wide cotton producing area, including the six provinces of Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Longdong in the Yellow River basin, and the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan in the Yangtze River basin. Other provinces in the southwest, such as Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Guizhou, are also flourishing. In addition, textile workers account for the largest number of workers in the country. From this, it can be seen that the rise and fall of the cotton industry is of great importance to our entire national economy.

Quality: The quality of cotton, in addition to being clean, dry, and free of water and ramie adulteration, is determined by the length, width, twist, and strength of its fibers. Long fibers can be spun into fine yarn, and vice versa. The standard for fiber length for ordinary spinning is:

The cotton produced in our country can be roughly divided into two types: one is "native cotton" and the other is "improved cotton," such as "American cotton." Native cotton is only suitable for spinning 12 to 16 count yarns; improved cotton, such as the American cotton of Shandong, especially "Lingbao cotton" (Henan), is the best, because its fibers average over one inch in length and can be spun into fine yarns of 20 to 32 counts or more. Higher count yarns are finer yarns, and vice versa are coarser yarns. Generally speaking, most domestic cotton can be spun into 20-count yarn.

The length of the fiber depends on the use of spinning and weaving, and it is most important that the length is uniform. Long fibers are soft, and vice versa are stiff. Warp yarns should use stiff raw yarns, and weft yarns should be soft. The so-called twist and strength refer to the degree of twisting of the fiber per inch. High twist fibers are strong and tough, and vice versa are loose and soft. Sea island cotton has a twist of 240 degrees per inch, Egyptian cotton has 180 degrees, Brazilian cotton has 140 degrees, Indian cotton has 120 degrees, and domestic cotton is roughly similar to Indian cotton.

Grades: To facilitate cotton transactions, exchanges rate various cottons according to their grades. In our country, the standard is domestic fine-staple cotton that can be spun into 20-count yarn. The first grade can be used as raw material for 32-count yarn, including Lingbao cotton, Luoyang cotton, Tianjin American cotton, and Shandong American cotton. The second grade is the standard grade, such as Tianjin fine-staple, Shandong fine-staple, Changyin fine-staple, Shashi and Hankou high-grade fine-staple, Tongzhou fine-staple, and Dongtai fine-staple. The third grade is raw material for 16-count yarn, such as Hankou, Shashi, and other fine-staple cottons, as well as cotton produced in Shanghai, Taicang, and other places. The fourth grade is raw material for 10-count or lower yarns, such as Yuyao, Shandong, Hankou, Tianjin, and other coarse staple cottons. Each grade is further divided into four classes: A, B, C, and D. In the past, our country's standard cotton was based on cotton that could be spun into 16-count yarn. Before the war, it was changed to 20-count yarn, which is a manifestation of the progress of our textile technology and the improvement of cotton quality. However, cotton quality improvement is still relatively backward. Therefore, although domestic cotton production is large, raw materials for fine yarns still need to be imported from abroad, and domestic cotton is exported to offset international payments.

American cotton is divided into nine grades on the New York Exchange, namely: (1) Middling fair (2) Strict good Middling (3) Good Middling (4) Strict Middling. The above are all upper grades. The fifth is Middling, which is the standard grade. The term "Middling" reported in the news refers to this. The next are (6) Strict low Middling (7) low Middling (8) Strict good ordinary (9) Goodordinary.

Indian cotton is divided into seven grades on the Bombay Exchange, namely: (1) Extra Superfine (2) Super fine (3) Strict fine. The fourth grade is fine, which is the standard grade. Below that are (5) wall up fine (6) Barely fine (7) fullygood. However, when Indian cotton is traded in Shanghai, it is classified by place of origin, namely Broaca, Gmra, and Brengal. Broaca and Brengal are the fourth-grade standard cottons, 7/8 inch and 5/8 inch long, respectively. They can be spun into 26 to 28 count yarns. Gmra is raw material for 20-count yarn.

Transactions: Before the war, cotton transactions in Shanghai were divided into two types: spot and futures. Trading unit: On the exchange market, the spot is 50 Sima dan, and the futures are 100 Sima dan. The market price is calculated in national currency yuan per dan, and the bid unit is five cents. Futures have a term of one to six months. Now they are all spot transactions. Foreign cotton is traded in term futures with foreign firms. The price is still calculated in Sima dan, and the transaction is calculated in bales. Each bale has a different weight, as follows:

Indian cotton (general) 400 lbs Brazilian cotton 400 lbs

(Southern) 500 lbs Egyptian cotton 730 lbs

Burmese cotton 400 lbs African cotton 400 lbs

American cotton 500 lbs

Domestic cotton packaging is divided into five types: iron rolls, large bales, medium bales, small bales, and burlap sacks. Iron rolls are wrapped in cloth and tied with iron sheets, weighing about 410 catties. Large bales weigh about 180 catties, medium bales weigh about 125 catties, and small bales weigh about 60 catties.

Futures traded on the New York Exchange are limited to twelve months, and the transactions in January, March, May, July, October, and November of each year are the most active.

### Orchid Seed High-Priced Goods Look Promising

The arrival of orchid seeds has been scarce recently. The market inventory is only a few dozen pieces. However, at the same time, the needs of various gangs are also weak. Therefore, the market situation is not very prosperous. The inventory of high-priced goods has been exhausted, and the firm's hand goods are also scarce. Therefore, the market outlook is promising.

### Hardware Spot Shortage, Market Booming

Recently, the hardware market has been affected by the closure of overseas sources and the extremely thin inventory of this street. Therefore, the circulating goods are increasingly scarce. The standard prices of various goods are booming. The minds of the industry are also invigorated. The entire market feels like there is a market but no goods. However, actual transactions have not been lively. The recent overview of various goods is recorded as follows:

Tinplate: American tinplate of sizes 24 and 26 has been out of stock for a long time. Currently, only a certain hardware store on North Suzhou Road can supply the market with a small number of spot transactions. The other inventories are even more negligible and cannot affect the market. It is found that the only destination for this product is drum makers, lock factories, and machine factories. Outer port orders have recently been cut off. The market atmosphere is very high due to the thinness of circulating goods. People's hearts are also holding firm on the sales offer. Yesterday, the price of size 24 goods was estimated at 1,200 yuan per box, and the price of size 26 was shouted at 950 yuan per box.

Ribbed Steel Bars: Ribbed steel bar transactions are weak because the construction gangs on this street have not extended their orders, and transactions with outer port merchants are also negligible. However, because overseas sources are not continuing, relying only on the inventory in this city is limited after all. The industry has seen this phenomenon. Although its sales are stagnant, the market is still holding firm. Yesterday's market price, such as 3-4 point sizes, required 3,300 yuan per ton, and 5-point to 1-inch goods were also sold for 3,250 yuan. Compared to the previous market, the dark market trend is very firm.

Black Steel Billets: Recently, the market has been showing extraordinary vigor due to the urgent search in the market. The market price has risen by as much as 100 yuan per day. Billet factories, printing factories, thermos factories, and machine factories on this street are taking advantage of the opportunity to bid. In the thin spot market, the search has become even scarcer, causing the market price to rise again. Currently, 2,000-pound old steel factory goods are priced at 3,700 yuan per bundle, and new steel goods are also sold for 3,600 yuan, which is another 100 yuan increase compared to before.

### Palaisse Cloth Rises Again

Palaisse cloth has rebounded again. Hongsheng goods are wholesaling for 11 yuan and 75 cents per yard, Zhanghua cotton sheep pattern for 20 yuan and 7 and a half cents, Ewo five blessings pattern for 21 yuan and 50 cents, Meifa for 24 yuan, Xiexin for 25 yuan, Yinfeng ordinary men's color for 21 yuan, first-class women's color for 25 yuan, Yuanfeng flying horse pattern for 28 yuan, British products for 37-38 yuan, and Dong goods No. 3000 for 19 yuan, which is an increase of half a yuan to one yuan per yard compared to last weekend. Striped and plain colors are selling well. The reasons are: (1) Although Palaisse cloth is a summer product, it also sells well in late spring and early autumn. (2) The rumors of large shipments arriving in previous months have now been proven to be only a few. (3) The factory price has always been high, and the recent output has decreased. The prices sold in the current market are still mostly contrary to expectations.

### Wax Thread Linen Sells Widely

The wax thread woven Chongma calico has been selling very well in the market recently. Large and small stores in the Western clothing gang have a great need for wholesale and retail. The Nanjing gang also has a strong appetite. Because it is the cheapest material for making Western clothing in the summer heat, it is quite popular and sells well. Customer clothing stores and uniform manufacturers continue to have designated demand. Yesterday, Fair and Lianxin brands, directly from the factory and large wholesalers and brokers, traded more than 100 pieces in the morning and afternoon. Beige is priced at 2 yuan and 30 cents, white is 2 yuan and 40 cents, and gray is 2 yuan and 50 cents. Beige is in strong demand, while gray and white colors are in relatively short supply. It is found that the factory's production is now mostly intended to deliver prepaid orders first, resulting in a shortage of spot inventory in the market, and the market price is even firmer than the previous day.

### Indian Coal Insists on Not Falling

Indian bituminous coal has been scarce in recent months. Although the inventory in this city is very sufficient, merchants are unwilling to sell it at a discount. Therefore, during this period of slow sales, it can still be maintained, which is not without reason. Currently, the industry's discounted prices are 430 yuan per ton for lump coal and 375 yuan per ton for slack coal. The ex-warehouse price of foreign firms, plus barge costs, is firmer than last month.

### Schellan Bandon Oak Tree Declares Dividends

Schellan Bandon Oak Tree Co., Ltd., managed by British firm Ewo, is scheduled to hold its 26th annual shareholders' meeting on June 23. A dividend of 40 cents in national currency per share is proposed for the year 1940.

### Western Newspapers Discuss Japan's Steps After the Breakdown of Dutch-Indonesian Negotiations: Rash Advance Southward Will Inevitably Fall into a Trap; the Netherlands, with British and American Assistance, Will Never Surrender

An editorial in the English-language Great American Weekly stated that Japan's threats to the Dutch East Indies in the past week were obviously a clumsy imitation, but the skills were lacking and the situation was different. A rash course of action would inevitably fall into the most dangerous trap in history, it can be asserted.

Wandering at a Crossroads, Not Knowing What to Do

Japan's behavior is obviously copying Hitler's old articles, attempting to coerce small countries to submit to its demands. This method, applied to Czechoslovakia, Austria, Romania, and Bulgaria, was effective. But what the Japanese have not understood is that if this method cannot take effect, it must be followed by force to achieve its goals. However, Japan currently has no sign of moving troops south to Borneo, Java, and Sumatra. Then, its other method is only to retreat in the face of difficulty. But the problem lies in how to avoid losing face.

The Situation Between Vietnam and the Netherlands is Different Now Than in the Past

The reason why Tokyo attempted to intimidate and threaten the Netherlands was that Japan had successfully dealt with French Indochina in the same way. However, the situation in the Netherlands and France is fundamentally different. Because France was originally one of the European powers, and its colonies were all over the world, the loss of Vietnam alone would not have a significant impact. Therefore, the Vichy side believed that it was better to give up a corner with pain and preserve other areas rather than fight a war with no hope of victory. But the situation in the Netherlands is very different. If it loses the East Indies, the Netherlands' position will be equal to that of Albania. Therefore, the Netherlands will do its best to protect it and will not hesitate to fight to the death. Moreover, the Dutch East Indies has obtained assistance from the United States and America, which cannot be compared with Vietnam.

Retreating in the Face of Difficulty is Almost Inevitable

Today, the Netherlands has firmly rejected Japan's demands. The Netherlands has the assistance of Washington and London, while Tokyo cannot hope for effective help from Berlin and Rome. Tokyo's choice is either force or breaking its word. Based on the current situation, Japan will probably break its word, and breaking its word is Japan's masterpiece. Examples include returning the Guandong Peninsula to China, canceling the Twenty-One Demands, forcing China to submit, and no longer interacting with General Chiang Kai-shek, etc.

### It is Rumored that Twelve Soviet Merchant Ships Will Sail to the Far East; Three Have Arrived in Hong Kong

Amidst the scarcity of ships on various Far East routes, Soviet ships are taking the opportunity to act as substitutes. The Soviet authorities have dispatched twelve large merchant ships to sail to various parts of the Far East. In the future, in addition to sailing to Shanghai, they will specialize in sailing to Hong Kong, Singapore, or Rangoon. This is because of the business agreement between the Soviet Union and Thailand, and its routes will extend to Bangkok, Thailand, Calcutta, India, and other places. According to sources in the shipping industry, a total of three ships have arrived in Hong Kong. Two of them have entered the Taikoktsui Shipyard in Hong Kong for repairs, and one has entered the Kowloon Shipyard for repairs. Each ship has a displacement of more than 5,000 tons. All crew members are Russian. The kitchen, miscellaneous, and restaurant staff among the crew are all Russian women. On one of the ships, the shipowner and cook are also Russian women. It is expected that Soviet ships will sail to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Rangoon, Bangkok, and other places. Under the international situation, it is generally believed that they are safer than ships of other nationalities and their business will be more developed.

### The French Municipal Council Will Change Office Hours Starting Today

The French Municipal Council has recently changed its hours and issued a special announcement yesterday (15th). Starting today (16th), the office hours will be from 8:30 am to 12:00 pm and from 2:30 pm to 5:00 pm every day.

### The Whole City Consumes Electricity Thriftily; Electricity Consumption Decreases; Both Concessions Obtain Congratulations and Records

The electricity companies in the two concessions in this city believe that the European war is expanding and the countries at war are successively requisitioning ships sailing to the Far East. As a result, the source of fuel for this city is feeling panic. Therefore, after obtaining the consent of the authorities of the two concessions at the beginning of this year, they have successively implemented electricity reduction measures. In order to achieve practical results, in addition to stipulating that those who exceed the electricity limit will be charged six times the fee, they have also carried out extensive publicity to persuade all industries to save unnecessary consumption. All citizens, in this time of hardship, are willing to work together, so they have also voluntarily saved electricity. According to reporters, the electricity consumption in April this year in the International Settlement was 56,242,000 kWh, of which 44,838,000 kWh was for industrial use and 6,092,000 kWh was for commercial use. Compared to March, industrial electricity consumption decreased by 2,057,000 kWh and commercial electricity consumption decreased by 1,081,000 kWh. The total electricity consumption in the French Concession in April was 5,100,000 kWh, which was also a decrease of 917,000 kWh compared to March. It is heard that the authorities of the two electricity companies in this city are still satisfied with this achievement, but they still hope that all sectors of the city will work hard to conserve electricity in order to achieve greater results.

### Freight Rates Between Hong Kong and Bangkok Increase Starting Yesterday; Freight Between Shanghai and Bangkok Has Not Yet Been Handled in the Same Way

Since the British ships sailing on the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Rangoon route have suspended operations due to war-related military relations at Guangzhou Bay and Haiphong, Vietnam, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield & Swire in this port have transferred ships to operate the Rangoon route. As for the freight rates for ships from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Rangoon, they were once increased by 15% two months ago. On May 25, the freight rates from Hong Kong to Rangoon were increased by another 35%. It is also rumored that Butterfield & Swire in Hong Kong announced that all freight rates between Hong Kong and Bangkok, including connecting freight, would be increased by approximately 25% starting yesterday. Reporters specially inquired about whether the prices of goods shipped from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Bangkok by the Taikoo company here will be increased at the same time. It is said that the goods shipped from Shanghai to Bangkok through Hong Kong are generally reported by the Taikoo Company headquarters in Hong Kong. This place has not yet taken the same measures as the Shanghai headquarters.

### After British and American Loans to China, the Stabilization Fund Increases Dramatically; the New Fund Totals 70 Million US Dollars and 5 Million Pounds of British Goods Loans to China

After the British and American loans to China to maintain foreign exchange and the currency system, the China Stabilization Foreign Exchange Fund Committee was established. The members for China were Chen Guangfu, Xi Demao, and Bei Songsun. The members for the United Kingdom were Rogers, and the members for the United States were Fox. Now, the above five members have arrived in Chongqing one after another to discuss the Stabilization Fund Committee

Preliminary Work

It was decided to fully maintain the legal foreign exchange. For the import of necessities, foreign exchange will be supplied as much as possible after government approval. As for the black market in Shanghai, in order to take care of the friendly countries' trade with China, it will continue to be maintained. However, speculators who manipulate prices and those who arbitrage for profit will be cracked down on. All friendly banks in Shanghai and Chinese banks that handle foreign exchange will cooperate to assist the committee to eliminate all improper foreign exchange transactions to make it

Sustainable

Regarding the committee's fund, in addition to the 10 million pounds that have not been used up in the past, the new fund is 50 million US dollars in US loans to China, 5 million pounds in British loans to China, and 20 million US dollars loaned by the National Bank of China to the government. Therefore, the fund is very sufficient, and both foreign exchange and currency credit can be maintained. All Chinese and foreign industries have unanimously expressed their support for the establishment of the committee.

### Wage Increase for the Shanghai Municipal Council Employees Will Be Reconsidered Today; All Parties Hope to Overturn the Original Proposal

The general wage increase plan for the Shanghai Municipal Council employees, since it was proposed by the Civil Service Commission, is believed by all sectors of the city to be sufficient to stimulate the rise in prices and make the public's living burden increasingly heavy. Therefore, it is urgently appealed that when the Municipal Council held its bi-weekly meeting last Wednesday, it once discussed the original proposal submitted by the Civil Service Commission. As a result, it was agreed to put it on hold temporarily. The increase in employees' salaries also makes it difficult for the Municipal Council's financial situation to be adjusted and raised. It is learned that the Civil Service Commission, under the order of the Board of Directors, is scheduled to convene a meeting at 4:30 pm today to re-examine the original wage increase proposal. Well-informed sources believe that today's Civil Service Commission meeting should adopt an extremely objective attitude and make the most prudent consideration. The points that should be noted are three: (1) The current basic salary, living allowance, and rice subsidy of the Municipal Council employees at all levels; (2) The general situation of current prices and whether there is a trend of rising step by step; (3) The salary and subsidy levels of other industries, and whether the levels of their salaries exceed those of the Municipal Council employees. Based on the above three points, it should be decided whether it is necessary to increase the salaries of the Municipal Council employees again based on the current objective situation. However, the general public believes that there is no most suitable reason for the Shanghai Municipal Council employees to increase their salaries again. For the sake of the happiness of the masses, it is hoped that the Civil Service Commission can overturn the original proposal at today's meeting. According to the rumored original wage increase plan of the Civil Service Commission, the employees' living allowance rate will be increased from 150% of the basic salary to 180% or 200%. It is also learned that, secondly, to increase the current net income of employees by 40%, or first add 20%, and then add another 20% as needed.

### Saigon Mixed Broken Rice Begins to Be Sold Off

The Saigon No. 1 and 2 mixed broken rice, which is managed by the import committees of the French Concession and operated by foreign firms, was first approved for shipment this month to Shanghai for relief. Last Friday, the import committees received a telegram from Saigon saying that this broken rice will continue to be shipped to Shanghai for relief. After receiving the telegram, the foreign firms began to sell off the July futures. Various grain stores also actively ordered. It is estimated that on Saturday (the day before yesterday) morning, Shenji and Heyi foreign firms sold off a total of about 2,500 tons.

### After the Assassination of a Dada Merchant, the Search is Intensified

After the Dada merchant and lawyer was shot and killed on the 13th of this month, the French police attached great importance to this bloody case. They are now actively searching for the fugitive shooter. It is learned that at 9:00 pm and 11:00 pm the night before, the French police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives and police cars to the inns on Tianzhu Church Street, Xin Yong'an Street, and Fada Road near the place where the Dada merchant was shot for a large-scale search, which lasted for a long time. As a result, there were still no gains.

Residents in the Nanshi District are All Subjected to Search

After the Dada merchant was assassinated on the 13th, the French Concession authorities suddenly strengthened their defense. Detectives are stationed at the iron gates in and out of Nanshi every day, and strict searches are carried out on pedestrians and vehicles. Since yesterday, Nanshi has also provided assistance, ordering pedestrians entering the concession to line up in a single file on the sidewalk in front of the Siming Guild Hall to proceed in turn. After passing through the iron gate, the detectives searched them one by one before letting them into the concession.

The Corpse is Scheduled to be Buried in the Public Cemetery

The Linxi Daily reported that after the French lawyer Dada was shot and killed in this port, his body has been moved from Guangci Hospital to Wanguo Funeral Home. It is scheduled to be buried in the Baxianqiao Public Cemetery at 9:00 am this Wednesday (18th). The French Concession Police Department is conducting a thorough investigation of the case and has determined that the murderer is a "terrorist." The office where Dada worked before his death was sealed off by the French Consulate authorities yesterday (14th).

### Today, All Sectors Commemorate the Passing of the Premier

Today is the 19th anniversary of the Premier's passing in Guangzhou. According to central government regulations, the two anniversary days of June 16, the Premier's passing in Guangzhou, and October 11, the Premier's passing in London, have been merged and moved to September 9, the anniversary of the Premier's first uprising. Although all sectors of the city will not hold ceremonies, they recall that on this day 19 years ago, the Premier was killed in Guangzhou due to Chen Jiongming's rebellion for more than 50 days. Although the situation was extremely dangerous, the Premier relied on not fearing power and not fearing violence, and struggled hard. In a short time, the traitor finally fell, and the Northern Expedition was finally promoted smoothly. In this time of national crisis, in addition to deeply commemorating, all sectors are determined to emulate the Premier's perseverance and unyielding spirit, work hard to resist construction, strive for the final victory, complete independence and liberation, and continue to promote the frugal movement to meet the needs of national construction.

### Plague Outbreak in Ningbo

The plague in Ningbo has recently relapsed. Due to the lack of management of sanitation work, it has spread rapidly since it occurred. The number of patients has reached more than 5,000, and the number of deaths totals more than 10.

### Western District Erection of Sandbag Fortifications to Strengthen Defense Work Due to Bandits Opening Fire and Rushing Through Obstacles, Authorities Forced to Adopt Better Protection

Along the border roads in the western district of the Public Concession, sandbag "fortifications" have now been erected next to the barbed wire obstacles to provide better protection for the police officers stationed there. The police authorities have long intended to take this measure. On the 14th of this month, bandits rushed through the obstacles at the intersection of Hart Road and Robison Road and shot three police officers, which accelerated the implementation of this measure. Two days ago, workers hired by the Public Works Department filled the foundations for sandbag piles at the intersections of roads along the border.

Once Erected, No Date for Removal

The sandbag "fortification" at the intersection of Bubbling Well Road and Avenue Foch (on the 16th) has been completed, reaching shoulder height. Once erected, there is no foreseeable date for its removal. According to reports, on the 14th of this month, a group of kidnappers, escorting a hostage, attempted to rush through the obstacles at the Hart Road intersection and escape into the "badlands" of western Shanghai. Police officers intercepted them, and they were shot at, injuring three officers, one of whom was seriously wounded in the head. On May 13th, there was also a case of an exchange of gunfire between Yao's bodyguard and the police. The Jing'an Temple Police Station then reported to the Police Department requesting the addition of sandbags for protection.

### Japanese Navy Expands Again, Blockading South China Seas, No Impact on Transportation in Sino-Japanese Free Zones, Third-Country Shipping Suffers Further Setbacks

Since the Japanese side announced the blockade of the Chinese coast starting from June-July last year, the shipping of third countries has suffered greatly, while the foreign goods needed by China are all imported via the Burma Road, without affecting the situation. Shimada, commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, announced the expansion of the Japanese military blockade line along the South China coast the day before yesterday, expanding the blockade area in Guangzhou Bay and other sea areas: (1) Haimen Bay, Qiwang Bay, and nearby sea areas west of Lotus Peak Cape of Good Hope; (2) Songlin Bay, Zhaoan Bay, Tongshan Bay, Futou Bay, and nearby sea areas included in the line connecting Da Mao Wu, the southern end of Nanao Island, Shizi Island, and Chiyu Jiangjun'ao in a cross shape. The Japanese Consulate in Shanghai has notified the Jianghai Customs and the consulates of various countries in Shanghai that it will take effect from zero hours on the morning of the 17th (tomorrow). However, there are no shipping lines between Shanghai and the above-mentioned places, and the customs has not announced the suspension of customs clearance.

### Robbers Open Fire, Resist Arrest, One Thief Shot, Two Captured Alive

At around 9 p.m. last night, a man was walking near North Szechuan Road and Chekiang Road when he was suddenly encountered by four robbers who blocked his way. One of the robbers hid a pistol in his long gown, the muzzle pointing out as a threat. He was robbed of a gold ring worth more than fifty yuan. As they were trying to escape, the man suspected that the gun held by the robber was a fake, so he shouted "Catch the thief!" and went forward to grab one of the robbers. Another robber fled south to the Dongxin Bridge on Avenue Edward VII when he happened upon detectives from the French Police Department inspecting pedestrians. Seeing that the three people looked flustered, he ordered them to stop and intended to search them. The robbers took the initiative and opened fire to resist arrest. The detective also drew his gun and fired back, wounding one of the robbers on the spot, a bullet hitting his abdomen. A pistol and five bullets were found on his body. Another robber was captured alive, while the other robber escaped without a trace. Afterwards, the injured robber was taken to Guangci Hospital. Because the incident occurred in the Public Concession, the injured robber was transferred to the Public Concession Police Hospital for treatment.

### Aiding Mother in Abusing Wife, Young Owner of Southern Goods Store Arrested

Zi Senquan, a native of Ningbo, the young owner of Da Hua Southern Goods Store at 190 Rue Mère Mathilde, 22 years old, married a woman of the same town, Ms. Ding (currently 21 years old), in October last year. The couple got along harmoniously after the marriage, but Zi Senquan's mother, Zhu (49 years old), for some reason, had no good feelings for her daughter-in-law, and recently regarded her as a thorn in her side, often scolding her for trivial matters, and sometimes beating her. Ms. Ding had no choice but to tell her husband the truth, but she was also scolded. Recently, Zi Senquan even helped his mother abuse his wife. If she was slightly unsatisfactory, he would beat her. A few days ago, due to some trivial matter, the mother and son beat Ms. Ding at home. The neighbors were indignant and secretly reported it to the French Police Department. The police sent personnel to arrest Zhu and her son. Ms. Ding was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment.

### Lord Mayor of London Cables Thanks to Shanghai British War Relief Society for Funds

The cable of thanks was sent from London on the 10th of this month, stating the use of the donation of 1,300 pounds. It is reported that the Shanghai British Distress Fund remitted a large sum of 1,000 pounds to London in April this year because London was bombed and the disaster was severe, for the purpose of refugee relief expenses. Since the outbreak of the European War, the British War Relief Society has remitted a total of 154,445 pounds to the British capital.

### Notes on Male and Female Suicides

### Direct Communication Between New York and San Francisco with South America, Announced by Shanghai Branch of Globe Wireless Company

The Shanghai branch of the American Globe Wireless Telegraph Company recently announced that the company has applied to the Washington Federal Communications Commission for permission to open the first direct wireless telegraph service between San Francisco and Bogota (Colombia, South America) and between New York and Bogota. The company also plans to reduce the telegraph fees from San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, and Los Angeles to Bogota by 14%, and the telegraph fees between New York and Bogota by 12%. The current telegraph fees have not changed for more than 15 years. The reduction of fees and the establishment of direct wireless telegraph service will encourage a more complete understanding and closer connection between the United States and South America.

### Shiliupu Ground Goods Industry Subject to Control Again Starting Yesterday

According to news from the ground goods industry yesterday, the Shiliupu ground goods industry has joined a certain Nanshi branch for business starting yesterday. According to reports, when the market was established in July last year, it had urged the Shiliupu ground goods industry to join, but the industry firmly refused because it did not conform to its business habits. Until recently, some small vegetable vendors who set up stalls for open-air business were forced to join the larger ground goods businesses due to livelihood pressure. Due to the special circumstances, they had to reluctantly join. It is said that the conditions for Shiliupu merchants to join are as follows: (1) The iron gate connecting the Nanshi Shiliupu, which used to open at 5 a.m. every morning and close at 10 p.m., has been changed to open earlier at 3 a.m. and close later at 12 p.m. in order to facilitate the access of merchants and vendors. (2) The vegetable market must be covered with straw sheds to prevent vegetables from being exposed to rain and sun. (3) The market side may collect a commission of 3 cents per yuan of goods value. (4) Prices must be estimated according to the actual situation in the market. According to a person in the ground goods industry, currently the goods that have joined, in addition to some vegetables transported from Pudong, are mainly eggplants, night-blooming cereus, and edamame transported from Hangzhou, totaling more than 1,000 pieces per day, with a total business volume of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. As for the fruits transported to Shanghai, they are not involved because the sources are different.

### Small Denomination Notes in Short Supply in Ningbo City, Large Denomination Notes Used at 80% of Face Value

Since the Ningbo Incident, the commercial market has not yet recovered. The crux of the problem lies in the withdrawal of the four banks, which makes financial circulation impossible. Residents avoid coming to Shanghai or hide in their hometowns, and the urban area population is sparse.

Before the Ningbo Incident, the currency in circulation was mostly in denominations of 50 yuan and 100 yuan. The notes were all stamped with the words "Chongqing" to prevent them from flowing into the occupied areas. These large denomination notes were called "large notes" locally. In the past, they could be exchanged at the four banks, so they could indirectly promote the prosperity of the commercial market.

Since the withdrawal of the four banks, these large notes cannot be exchanged, which has seriously hit the business community, and the small denomination notes left in the Ningbo market have all flowed to Shanghai to purchase rice, resulting in an increasing shortage of circulating funds in the Ningbo market, which is similar to suffering from anemia. The merchants and people are even more distressed, and large denomination notes are used at 80% of face value.

The Ningyu Steamer

is afraid of being requisitioned, so it is still stranded in Yuyao, so the traffic between Ningbo and Yuyao only relies on boats, and the schedule is extremely chaotic. The serious rice shortage has not been alleviated at all, but has become even worse. There are already Japanese liaison ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo, each carrying Ningbo local products for export to Shanghai.

### Old Woman Falls to Her Death

Zhang Bu, an old woman from Wuxi residing at 157 Mingguo Road, 59 years old this year, has been suffering from mental illness due to the recent harsh environment. Her daily actions were abnormal. At 7 p.m. on the 14th, she accidentally fell down the stairs at home, and her head was injured, causing her to faint. She was sent to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late to save her life.

### On the Works of Ni Yide

— Zhaotong

Although Impressionist painting brought about a major revolution in color, the result was that their own works became a game of color, forming a delicate, empty, and aesthetic expression. As the times have changed, nine out of ten Western painters who have even a slight inclination have been more or less influenced by Impressionism. However, in the works of Ni Yide, there is not a trace of such an influence. On the contrary, he belongs to the era before Impressionism, or after Cézanne. The characteristic of his style is the expression of a giant's sense of form, the establishment of a majestic realism, laying a solid and unshakable foundation for China's new art.

From such technical cultivation, he went on to pay attention to the issue of subject matter. Western painting, from Impressionism to the modern 20th century, paid too much attention to "how to express," but forgot the question of "what to express," thus falling into the shortcomings of the emptiness of content in painting. Soviet socialist new realism and the recent French Surrealism are powerful reactions to this tendency. Starting from the ideas of new realism and surrealism, he conceived a kind of nationalistic subject matter.

The so-called "expression of the national spirit" is a very vague statement. What kind of national spirit do we need after all? The kind of lofty, elegant, chic, and detached taste expressed in traditional Chinese painting, which is praised by Westerners as the Chinese national spirit, is it what modern China needs? The Chinese national spirit has been transformed since the Jin and Tang Dynasties due to the influence of Lao-Zhuang philosophy, especially the influx of Buddhist thought. We can see the most obvious examples of the expression of this transformed national spirit in Li Bai's poems and in Yun Lin and Shi Tao's paintings. The true Chinese national spirit should be before the Qin and Han Dynasties, which was a spirit of majestic tragedy, generosity, and chivalry, a spirit with a sense of reality, a "Great Knight's soul." The most concrete and clear expression of this spirit in literary and artistic works is Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian." Shaping and modernizing this spirit is probably the theme attempted in Ni's recent works.

However, there is a clear distinction between works of art and propaganda posters. The nature of propaganda posters is explanatory, analytical, and enumerative, while the expression in works of art is symbolic, suggestive, and comprehensive. Therefore, a painting with content does not necessarily have to be a narrative of a story or an explanation of an idea. It is a complete and elusive thing. We cannot understand it, but only feel it. For example, what is depicted in Ni's recent work "Great Han" is only a horse, two Great Hans, and a background of yellow earth. However, in this, we can understand the tragic mood of the ancient poet's "A solitary smoke rises straight from the desert, the setting sun hangs round over the Yellow River." At the same time, we can also imagine the sacred mission of modern Chinese youth in the Central Plains and outside the Great Wall. The "Virgin Land" represents the development of the resources of Free China. "Plateau" only depicts two horses, but the horses seem to be personified, with a firm and resolute character. The form is magnificent and bold. The painting "Nostalgia" adopts the techniques of the Surrealist school, expressing the mood of the long and great ancient China.

The Italian modern painter Chirico (Theme) modernizes the memory of ancient Rome. Ni's works have similarities with Chirico. He is trying to modernize the shaping of the great spirit of the ancient Chinese nation.

Such works have gone beyond appreciation and taste, and are commemorative works of a permanent nature.

### YMCA Health Campaign Closes

The summer health campaign organized by the YMCA closed yesterday. The number of visitors broke all previous records. The exhibits and health knowledge listed were of great benefit, so the guests were all interested in it. In view of the fact that external diseases such as boils, heat rash, scabies, and dampness are extremely popular this season, the association has obtained a large number of "Ding's Ointment" from Hua Yi Pharmaceutical Factory and distributed them to guests to maintain their health. Those who received it were all delighted. The fact that this exhibition achieved such a satisfactory result in the shortest possible time is due to the efforts of the association, and the tireless assistance of major pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai such as Wuzhou, Hua Yi, and Guangming is also particularly meritorious.

Study Lecture

### How to Study English (4)

— Ye Jingfeng

This method may feel unfamiliar at first, but you will naturally get used to it after one or two tries. This approach has at least two benefits: (1) it helps you understand how to structure paragraphs in writing, and (2) having grasped the overall meaning, you can guess the meaning of unfamiliar words to some extent in each sentence. Even when consulting a dictionary, you won't feel completely lost about how to interpret the word. It's quite exciting to guess six or seven tenths of the word's meaning. 1. What to Pay Attention To The author's habit is to focus on the longest sentence, the shortest sentence, or the most irregular sentence in a paragraph. While this method may not be a perfect guide, it can spark interest in studying. However, the most important thing is to pay attention to structures that differ from Chinese. For example:

I went there on business.

This translates to "I went there to do something." If the sentence uses a special structure:

Business took me there.

This requires special attention, as this type of construction is rare or perhaps non-existent in Chinese sentences. Sentence structures like this are common in English, but it's difficult for us to think of them when we write ourselves. Passive voice constructions are also used frequently in English, which we don't tend to use as much. Consequently, our sentences often have a Chinese flavor. Next, we should pay attention to idioms. For example:

She has left her home for good and all. Some people might not understand this sentence. If we translate it as "She left her home for good and all good," it would be a joke. This is because we don't understand that "for good" means "forever" and "and all" means "altogether," so we don't know it should be interpreted as "She has abandoned her home forever."

If we want our English to be elegant, we must understand and accurately use these idioms.

Next, we should pay attention to meaningful individual words. For English learners, a good word is a treasure. These treasures are our assets. However, these treasures have wings. Even if you catch them for a moment, they will fly away if you are not careful. To hold onto them, it's best to use them often.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### The Philosophy of Beauty

— Wang Yizhi

—— Shanghai people's greatest shortcomings are "transportation" and "housing"——

As the nation faces difficulties, everyone shares the sorrow. The scarcity of resources leads to mental distress, which is not unique to Shanghai, nor limited to China. However, human effort matters, and the environment is shaped by the mind. Finding solace in one's spirit can often compensate for material poverty. I have a piece of advice for readers: "Happiness, health, and beauty are mutually causal." A love for beauty is a natural right shared by all humanity. When people are struggling with hunger and cold, they have no time to think about "beauty." If one is trapped in a cold place, like a great, freezing church, listening to a famous musician, they might retreat in fear, having no heart to appreciate the beauty of the pure sounds. When people are extremely tired, they also don't know how to find pleasure in beauty. Laborers like cattle and horses, as well as domestic servants, fall asleep as soon as their work is done and never feel any beauty in their lives. Similarly, child brides under the oppressive authority of old Chinese families, and children in some families who are restricted by tradition and unable to express their natural inclinations, as well as child laborers in the early industrial age in foreign countries who were not protected by laws, and apprentices who spent their lives hunched over before machines were invented, generally appear half-withered. Those who look at them cannot feel any positive emotions. When this happens to women, it can even make it difficult for them to find a suitable partner for life. A recent poem says, "Surely their inner thoughts will never be understood, they entrust their flowering talent to a sick plum blossom." These few words fully express the hidden pain of human destruction of natural beauty.

Moreover, people have different heights. Although it is said that there are racial differences between East and West, I observe that in European and North American countries, free people who are well-fed and well-clothed produce children who steadily grow taller and stronger (not like the children of the poor who are thin despite being tall). In contrast, in the Chinese nation, with its four thousand years of history, due to a lack of mental well-being and outdoor exercise, the stature of later generations has gradually become smaller. This is the opposite. Deciding when humans age, although it differs due to race, since the founding of the Republic, new families have escaped the troubles of concubines and the hardship of mother-in-law relationships. We often see that married middle-aged women are more beautiful than middle-aged spinsters. As for the graceful appearance of young people studying in America, it is because school villages in the New World are conducive to being close to nature and daring to beautify themselves, or working hard at sports to develop their physique, or learning social skills to harmonize their natural instincts. The easiest exercise is to walk long distances, and the most beneficial social activity is to be brave in helping others. This is the greatest pleasure and benefit that even a poor country like China, or an isolated island like Shanghai, can offer to everyone.

To put it bluntly, the use of beauty is extensive. The happiness it brings is both immediate and far-reaching. Who would not hope that their spouse and children become more beautiful day by day? For people in Shanghai, the greatest shortcomings are "transportation" and "housing." When traveling, one cannot always walk on shady paths, and there is little pleasure in strolling. When living, one cannot expand the courtyard at home, and the temperament of children deteriorates. However, all the inventions, accomplishments, and most of the amazing achievements in the world often originate from temporary hardship, or from a self-interested and selfish thought, suddenly gaining unexpected happiness and joy. If we want to do our best to compensate for the lack of nature, then in these years of worrying about hunger and cold, we should pay attention to the reason why happiness, health, and beauty are mutually causal. Perhaps every day there must be a certain time to approach art, music (such as phonograph records), or heart-pleasing poetry, books, and literature as much as possible to temporarily forget the environment of life. Or rely on strong will and self-discipline, never to hurt people with harsh words and expressions (certainly not wanting to inflict harsh words and expressions on children), relying on this to cultivate the ecological beauty of companions and groups that has not yet been lost. Or learn to work hard and move more, be careful about food, and thus express their own healthy beauty. Shanghai is now one of China's major cities and is also convenient for approaching world trends, so it will not be like those trapped in remote and poor villages who tend to decline due to the lack of external objects for reference. It is truly unfortunate but fortunate.

### Talking About Raincoats in the Plum Rain Season

— Huang Ziqiang

The times are constantly progressing. When our country had not yet discovered raincoats, everyone used umbrellas to shield themselves from the rain. Later, Europe and the United States imported a kind of raincoat, which was worn on the body, both lightweight and comfortable. Raincoats are divided into many types due to the different materials:

First: Rubber raincoats. There are also two types of this kind of raincoat: pure rubber and laminated rubber. Pure rubber raincoats are relatively thick and heavy in texture, but they are not strong and easily tear. Laminated rubber raincoats cannot be washed clean of dirt, or they easily let water in after washing; at the same time, after being exposed to rain and water, they gradually increase the weight of the raincoat, which is extremely unsanitary for the body, especially too cold in winter and too hot in summer.

Second: Rainproof cloth raincoats. The texture is relatively light and convenient, but they cannot waterproof when encountering heavy rain or staying in the rain for a long time; at the same time, the effectiveness is lost after three or four washes, so they are not durable to wear; another disadvantage is that, like rubber raincoats, they are not suitable for winter and summer.

Third: Transparent oil silk raincoats. This kind of raincoat is thin and light, comfortable to wear, and the solid texture allows air to permeate, allowing body temperature to evaporate. Furthermore, stains can be wiped off easily. They are most suitable for wearing outside coats in winter.

According to customs reports, more than 13 million yuan of foreign goods are imported every year. In recent years, especially Japanese goods, the number of imports has occupied the first place. The first type of laminated rubber raincoats and the third type of oil silk raincoats are mostly Japanese goods on the market. There are also many American goods, and the texture varies, with American goods being the most refined, but the price is extremely high, requiring more than one hundred yuan per item.

It was not until the past two or three years that domestic oil silk raincoats began to be produced. According to the current consensus in the domestic raincoat industry, the products produced by the Meilun Waterproof Fabrics Factory are the most refined and can be compared with American goods, while the price is only half of the American goods.

One of the main raw materials for oil silk transparent raincoats is silk. Since the occupied areas were controlled, Shanghai has been unable to purchase high-quality silk materials, which has had a great impact on the output of the domestic industry. However, Meilun was able to find ways to make up for the deficiency under these difficult circumstances, and the products can still be compared with American goods, which is truly the glory of the domestic industry.

### Monday Home Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Sword beans have not been on the market for long and are still very tender. They cost about 30 cents per pound, which is not cheap, but if you add some auxiliary ingredients, one pound can make two small bowls for both day and night meals. There are not many ways to cook sword beans. For meat dishes, you can only stir-fry them with shredded pork, braise them with sliced pork, or add them to eel shreds as a representative of a flat dish, which is also not impossible. As for vegetarian dishes, you can stir-fry them with sliced water chestnuts or dried tofu shreds, or braise them with fragrant mushrooms and tofu. Vegetarian old ladies will definitely welcome them.

### Snail Dwelling and Conch Domain

— Zheng Yimei

It is not easy to live in Chang'an. Land is expensive in Shanghai, even more so than in Chang'an. One's space for eating, drinking, and resting is confined to a corner, to the point where it is difficult to even unroll a scroll or settle down to study. How much more so for those who burn incense, play the zither, discuss swords, or play the flute. In the past, my late friend Hu Jichen called his residence "Snail Dwelling," describing its narrowness, which can be said to be very apt. Xie Zixian, known as Xian'ou, is skilled in the six methods of painting. With his brilliant brushwork, he depicts the illusory scene of the Conch Domain, making people smile knowingly and further believe in the special nature of life in Shanghai. His illusory scenes of the Conch Domain are often drawn on postcards. Among the green peaks and beautiful ravines are several butterflies. Within them, there are several monks, and several things such as chimes, money, banners, and canopies, as well as all the details of palm-leaf scriptures, prayer cushions, bright lamps, and Buddha niches, all exquisitely prepared. When viewed with a magnifying glass, the faces are lifelike, and the expressions are vivid. Mustard seed Sumeru, seeing the big in the small, is truly the ultimate in bizarre and varied skills, which only famous masters can achieve. However, Xie Zi does not do it easily because it consumes too much eyesight and time. Now, a collotype edition of Xie Xian'ou's painting collection has been printed and is being distributed by the World Bookstore. The figures, ladies, landscapes, and Buddhist images are all extremely marvelous, and the illusory scenes of the Conch Domain are especially worthy of appreciation. The taste of the game opens up the mountain art garden. The saying goes, "Creation enters the tip of the brush, and the tip of the brush steals creation." Xie Zi's skills are truly commendable.

### Cars on the Streets of Moscow

— Xi Nong

We have long been accustomed to seeing cars in Shanghai, but they are all imported products loaded from Europe or the New World. However, most of the cars seen on the streets of Moscow now are made by the Soviet Union's own Gorky and Moscow factories.

The Soviet Union had no automobile industry ten years ago; however, the automobile industry in recent years has advanced rapidly and developed quickly. The Soviet masses already have great strength and good car-making technology; the products of the Gorky and Moscow two major automobile factories are still not enough to meet the needs and are being expanded as much as possible.

The cars on the streets of Moscow are now like those in major cities around the world, passing through like waves in teams; trucks and most passenger cars belong to state public institutions. Other factories, newspapers, clubs, and social organizations all have service cars and office cars; thousands of workers come and go, rushing to their future with heroism.

Under capitalism, workers naturally acknowledge that cars are the exclusive property of exploiters; privately owned black-plated cars are even more symbols of exploiters. So, perhaps there will be no privately owned black-plated cars in the socialist capital of Moscow? But in fact, citizens of Moscow also have privately owned cars. This is a manifestation of the prosperity of the Soviet people; privately owned cars only began after the Soviet Union had its own automobile industry. I remember that six years ago, the Soviet government issued an order that pilots who flew more than 300,000 kilometers could receive a car for transportation. In recent years, the most technically superior workers at the Moscow Gorky Automobile Factory have each been given a car. It can be seen that privately owned cars on the streets of Moscow are the result of the excellent achievements of technically superior workers; and they are very different from privately owned black-plated cars in our Shanghai.

Correction: Regarding the article "Cart Drivers in the Southwest" last week, I recently received a letter from a reader stating that "cart driver" should be changed to "car driver," and "truck driver" in the article should also be changed to "truck driver." This correction is made above.

I really can't describe the heart of the second landlord. Of course, any kind of people are a mix of good and bad. However, this landlord of mine can be said to be the representative of the personality of "Shanghai Second Landlords." He became a second landlord before the Incident, with very small rents and no transfer fees. Even now, after the new rent increase, the three-story building is only a little over 120 yuan; in addition to living in two floors himself, he charges almost 300 yuan for the three rooms on the third floor and one room on the second floor? The location is in an alley at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Luber, which has never been vacant. Since the Incident, it has been even more profitable three times over.

He raises the rent at least four times a year, and also charges for tap water, electricity, house taxes, and even the streetlights at the alley entrance, the strips used in the kitchen, and the funnels for pouring water. He almost demands everything from the third tenants every day. In fact, the cost of tap water and electricity has only increased by a few tens of percent at most, but he wants to exceed the fixed price.

Adding Three and Five, Following the Current

Taking last year as an example, the rent and tap water fees have been increased four or five times. In January of this year, he increased the rent again. His reason for the rent increase was that the first landlord had increased his rent, which was a legitimate reason, and the obligation of the third tenants was undeniable. Unexpectedly, three months later, last month, the second landlord's wife issued an order to increase the rent again. She said, "The first landlord has increased the rent, the tap water fee has also risen, and next month there will be an increase in house taxes, so we have to increase your rent as well. If you don't want to pay more, move out quickly." The few of us third tenants were not afraid of her female authority, but felt strange. Why did the first landlord increase the rent in January, and now the first landlord is increasing the rent again? The first landlord's increase is a general increase and can never increase twice in four months. So, everyone inquired separately and found out that the rent increase in February was driven by the second landlord's greed, and this rent increase was actually instigated by the first landlord.

Extra Profit, Forty-Nine Percent

However, we now realize that he was fraudulent last time and should ask him to refund the rent he increased last time. Then, we should increase the rent from the date when the first landlord increased his rent, which would be a reasonable solution. However, the second landlord will not reason with you, and there are even more unreasonable things than this. The French Concession tap water fee has only increased by 26 percent this time, as recorded in the newspaper, and everyone knows it. He has to increase it by 75 percent (based on the original basic amount of the tap water fee). What is the reason for this? Only he himself knows, which is that because the tap water fee has increased, you, the third tenants, have to pay for the water he uses himself. In the past, he decided the electricity bill, and you had to pay whatever he said you used. Now, some of us third tenants have installed our own water meters, and this time she copied the codes and found that they did not match the last digit. Isn't this clearly a trick she is playing? There is also a joke that one of our tenants does not play mahjong with his family, which is also a factor in the rent increase.

Man in the Inner Quarters, Woman Leaving the River East

The world is so big, there is everything, and there are even more strange things about landlords in Shanghai. Our second landlord, Mr. Zhu, hides in the room and does not come out (this not coming out means not meeting with the third tenants, because when he comes out, he has his own car to ride in). He lets his wife come out and confront us. It is not an exaggeration to call her a female tiger. Because she sees that the third tenants are unwilling to increase the rent, she will refuse to collect the rent, and at the same time, she will issue a roar demanding that you move out immediately! If the second tenant ignores her, she will even quarrel with you, with great momentum and boundless anger, wanting to fight and use force, stop supplying tap water, cut off electricity lines, and even more inhumanely, when you are cooking, she will stir up dust and let it fall into your food. She keeps saying that she wants to hit people, saying, "If a woman hits a man, the man does not dare to fight back." Her purpose is that because she cannot resolve things with you through reason or law, she wants to disturb you and insult you privately, sparing no effort to use the most despicable means to make you unable to live in peace, unless you increase the rent.

She does not understand justice, she forgets public health and public order, and she does not know the law. She only knows how to use despicable and dirty means to fight for her own petty interests.

But what about "him"? Will this Mr. Zhu always hide in the room and not come out? A third tenant on Avenue Joffre respectfully submits

### Also Considered "Long-Gown Class"

— Sun Yifan

May I ask, can you wear a short shirt to class as a teacher? That has probably never happened before! The little children all wear long gowns, although most of them are torn and patched. Can teachers not wear long gowns? Can they not be properly dressed? Standing on the podium, what would they look like? In fact, teachers are exactly the same as coolies, only with the distinction of "long gown" and "short shirt."

In principle, we can no longer afford to wear long gowns. Look! Rice, coal, and daily necessities are getting more expensive day by day, but salaries remain the same. I'm afraid the long gown with eight holes on my body will have to rely on patching again. In fact, my wife at home has already worn short shirts (not because it's hot). Am I also considered "long-gown class"? What about the entire elementary school teacher community?

"Long-gown class" has face but no substance.

"Teacher, your long gown is torn!"

(9) An Eccentric Farmer

He sat down again on the wooden bench in front of the lamp. The letter Zhao Si had asked someone to write for him was taken out and looked at for the seventh time: The Dong Province Colonial Bank has already collapsed. Is there any hope of recovering even half a penny of the more than three thousand yuan? What should he do if the Fuhua Bank also went bankrupt in the same way?

A gust of cold wind blew in again through the cracks in the window, causing him to unconsciously tighten the cloth belt around his waist even more.

"I'll set off tomorrow to rush there. I wonder if it's still in time?" He thought that since things had become so serious, he certainly had to make a trip; but when his fingers stroked his face, the two intersecting scars, the scraps of skin rolled up like the edges of dumplings, and the small piece missing from his nose, all made him so discouraged that he dared not even think of going out.

For the past three or four years, because he had been with those farmers all along, they had gradually become accustomed to his strange appearance, and the self-consciousness and shame in his heart had unknowingly diminished day by day. Now that he suddenly had to go out, he really didn't know what method to use to muster up his courage.

He repeatedly stuffed Zhao Si's letter into a pocket on his shirt, then straightened the short blue cotton-padded jacket he was wearing on the outside, and slowly stood up from the wooden bench.

"Why, child, why aren't you asleep yet?" He turned his head and looked towards the kang, and Mei Bao's eyes were still not closed, her face revealing a kind of melancholy rarely seen in children.

"Papa, today the nanny said that her whole family is going back...!."

This was another unexpected piece of news.

"Nonsense, child, she's just saying that to tease you."

"No, Papa, it's true!" Even though Mei Bao was still a six-year-old child, she could no longer be fooled about what was true and what was false. "Brother and sister are both... both saying that. Their papa, who is... that Wang Si, is putting clothes... putting them into... boxes...!."

"What?" Begonia asked in surprise. (133)

### Encountering a Soulmate

— Xinghua

I have been unemployed for a long time and I am very bored at home. Every day, I just run around the roads and walk around everywhere. Today, I unintentionally met an old friend whom I had not seen for many years.

"Hello! Long time no see." He greeted me first.

"Old Li, I didn't expect that we would meet on the road."

"The weather is really nice today! Haha!" After inspecting me from head to toe.

"The weather is really nice, haha! Haha,"勉强地(reluctantly).

"Very good! Very good, haha!"

"You must be very successful lately, old brother."

"Where, where, it is said that you have made a fortune lately."

"To tell you the truth, I have been unemployed at home for the past few days. Old brother, you have a wide social circle, can you help me find a job?" Impulsively.

"This... this..." His two eyebrows squeezed together, his nostrils turned upwards.

"As long as it's enough to maintain my livelihood, I don't care about the salary." I knew I was being too presumptuous.

"...Look, how spirited that foreigner walks!" I didn't expect him to answer like that.

"What! You won't even help with this small favor?"

"Hmm, what song is that foreigner humming? Oh! I remember! I have a meeting today! Excuse me, I won't keep you company, goodbye!"

"......" I stood blankly at the crossroads.
