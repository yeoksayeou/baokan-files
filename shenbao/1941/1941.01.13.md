### Completion of Sino-Soviet Trade Agreement; Total Value of Goods Amounts to Tens of Millions; Both Parties Limited to Delivery of Goods Within the Year; Part Three of Agreement Recently Signed

Chongqing - According to a report in the "Saodang Bao," mouthpiece of the Chinese Army, negotiations for the Sino-Soviet barter trade agreement were completed at the end of last year. The content is divided into three parts. The first and second parts involve China exchanging wool and tea worth 10 million yuan for Soviet supplies. These two parts were signed and announced earlier. The third part involves China exchanging minerals for Soviet machinery and other goods, and it was also signed recently. It is reported that the total value of goods included in this barter trade agreement is estimated to be tens of millions of yuan, which is the highest figure in Sino-Soviet trade relations to date. All goods under the agreement must be delivered and cleared within this year. The newspaper praised this agreement as further evidence of increased Soviet aid to China. (Reuters, 12th)

Chongqing - The third part of the Sino-Soviet trade agreement was recently signed, completing the entire agreement. According to the agreement, the first part stipulates the quantity of Chinese tea to be exported to the Soviet Union, the second part stipulates the quantity of wool to be exported to the Soviet Union, and the third part stipulates the quantity of minerals to be exported to the Soviet Union. In return, the Soviet Union will export machinery and military supplies to China. Both parties are limited to clearing the goods within this year. Although the total amount of the barter trade has not been announced, the tea portion alone amounts to 10 million yuan in Chinese currency, so the magnitude of the total quantity can be imagined. Official sources say that this agreement will open a new era in Sino-Soviet trade and will prove that Soviet aid to China is becoming more active. (Havas, 12th)

### Japanese Troops Invade Jiuling Mountains; Over 4,000 Killed or Wounded; Chinese Troops Defeat Japanese One by One; Capture Southeast Stronghold of Tongcheng

Dongjiang - Three hours after the recovery of the outposts around Jiuling Mountains, the reporter re-ascended the mountains for inspection. Looking down at Dongting Lake, it was boundless. Looking north at Wuhan, it was magnificent. Chinese and Japanese troops have fought for this majestic mountain twice. The first time was during the Hubei Campaign the year before last, and this is the second time. Both times, the Chinese army won. This time, the Japanese army used the strength of the Kuma troops to encircle the Chinese on both wings starting from the 6th, intending to extend their outer defense line of Tongcheng to Jiuling. When they advanced, Huang'an Baoding Pass on the left wing of the Chinese and Yangtai Jian Yuntang Ridge on the right wing were disturbed by the Japanese. The advanced outposts on the front of Jiuling were proactively withdrawn by the Chinese army due to the protruding terrain. Starting on the 8th, the Chinese army launched annihilation battles on both the left and right flanks. Since the morning of the 9th, the Japanese were defeated one by one, not only driving out all the Japanese troops invading the two wings of Jiuling, but also restoring the original appearance of the advanced outposts on the front of Jiuling. The Chinese pursuit troops had directly reached the city of Tongcheng on the 11th. The Japanese strongholds of Wanshan and Zhengshan on the southeast sides of Tongcheng were also under Chinese siege. Based on the Japanese corpses and wounded soldiers seen along the way, and further confirmed by the confessions of prisoners, it is judged that the death toll in this invasion is at least over 4,000, especially the troops belonging to the Machijiri Division, which suffered the most casualties. Refugees from the war zone have recently returned to their hometowns to rebuild their homes. The Hunan Provincial Government has sent personnel to the war zone to handle relief and rehabilitation, and the people are full of joy. (12th)

The Chinese army broke them down and defeated them one by one, causing the Japanese to suffer heavy casualties and retreat northward. In this battle, a total of over 4,000 Japanese soldiers were killed, and a large amount of supplies and military equipment were captured. Another unit of the Chinese army completely destroyed the Japanese military works in Dafu Town of Chongyang and Wulipai of Tongcheng on New Year's Eve. The Japanese troops in Western Hubei, Yichang Longquanpu, who were attacking Xu Zhenmiao Shimenzi, were defeated by the Chinese. The Chinese army near Shashi recaptured Zhuanqiao (16 li from the city) and Cong Cong Wan (8 li from the city) on the 4th. The Japanese launched several counterattacks, but all failed.

Jiangxi-Guangdong

In Jiangxi Province, the Japanese battalion commander Fukuyama, who was wounded in the left arm in the battle of Xishan (west of Nanchang) last year, died in Nanchang at the beginning of the month. Recently, the Japanese army near Nanchang has been frequently stirring. On the 5th, 6th, and 7th, they made contact in Shanbei Zhao Ta and Dong Wang and other places north of Shabu Tan (southeast of Nanchang), but were repelled by the Chinese, with a total of over 600 Japanese soldiers killed or wounded. The Chinese army in Zhangshupu rushed into the Japanese阵and completely destroyed their works. The Chinese army near Pengze attacked Phoenix Mountain and captured Xiaomei Mountain on the morning of New Year's Day. At dawn on the 1st, the Japanese infantry and cavalry in Sanshui, Guangdong Province, jointly attacked Huangcheng, but were fiercely attacked by the Chinese in the area of Shangxia Keng, suffering losses and fleeing back. On the 29th, the Chinese army launched a night raid on Fuhe Wei in Zengcheng, directly entering the Japanese阵and completely destroying all Japanese works. The Chinese army attacking Shenzhen on New Year's Eve was quite successful. The next morning, the Japanese launched a counterattack on Henggang, but were still fiercely attacked by the Chinese and fled back. In the Chaoshan area of Eastern Guangdong, over a thousand Japanese infantry and artillery launched continuous attacks on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th, but were all repelled by the Chinese army.

Other

(1) On the 8th, Japanese aircraft bombed Huiyang in Guangdong Province, destroying the Italian church and killing the Dean, Ms. Wanli (transliteration), the nurse, Ms. Dixi (transliteration), and two monks, as well as several workers. The Chinese side deeply regrets this. (12th)

### National Food Conference Scheduled to Be Held in Chongqing; Determine Inter-Provincial Food Supply and Demand; Solve Food Problems in Various Provinces

Chongqing - The National Food Conference is about to be held in Chongqing. Representatives from the food control committees of various provinces will gather here to discuss the national food control issue. It is reported that the current monthly rice demand for 500,000 residents of Chongqing is 100,000 shi. According to the current plan, the National Food Control Committee can transport 240,000 shi of rice to Chongqing from neighboring areas each month. It is widely expected that the problem of rice shortage here will be resolved soon. (Reuters, 12th)

Chongqing - The National Food Conference, originally scheduled to be held on February 20th, has been moved forward. The main topic will be to determine the supply and demand of food between provinces in order to solve the food problems in the southeastern provinces. (Havas, 12th)

Chongqing - The National Food Administration is scheduled to convene a National Food Conference on the 20th of next month. Representatives from various provinces will come to Chongqing to attend, in order to discuss the food management policies for this year. (Havas, 11th)

Chongqing - The registration of grains and goods in Chongqing is progressing smoothly, and the general price level is also considered stable. According to the opinions of authoritative figures in the economic community, registration is only one of the transitional measures to stabilize prices. The most important thing to pay attention to is proper handling after registration, and the management methods should be announced as soon as possible to stabilize business sentiment. If so, those with inventory will be willing to sell, and new goods can come in continuously, matching supply and demand, and the price stabilization work can easily get on the right track. Regarding this point, it is reported that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and relevant agencies have drafted "Measures for Combating the Hoarding of Important Goods in Extraordinary Times," which also specifies reasonable profits for merchants in detail to ensure their protection.

Editorial: The Alertness That Should Exist Amidst the US's Outflow of War Materiel

Following closely on the heels of the US President's congressional message and the unprecedentedly massive national defense budget proposal, the US State Department simultaneously submitted to both houses of Congress at noon on the 10th the broad "War Materiel for Aiding Democratic Nations Act." This act stipulates that as long as the US President deems it beneficial to the US's national defense, he may disregard conflicts with other laws and authorize the Army and Navy at any time to supply warring democratic nations with war materiel in every possible way. Only now, after the cessation of the Great European War, has the US authorities once again adopted an extremely active and resolute policy of intervention in the world situation, and the prediction by the Americans last fall that Roosevelt's re-election would lead to ever-increasing advances in his foreign policy has now been powerfully demonstrated in fact.

For days, Nazi Germany has boasted of its success in concluding a new agreement with the Soviet Union as a diplomatic triumph; however, even if the quantity of a barter-based economic agreement is doubled compared to before, its actual value is likely insufficient to compensate for one-hundredth of the great "arsenal" that democratic nations obtain from the United States! Britain, China, and Greece will receive unprecedentedly significant support from the United States, while on the Axis side, only Germany receives a considerable exchange of goods from the Soviet Union, and even that is exchanged for concessions regarding the Baltic region. In Japan, even the long-running trade negotiations with the Soviet Union and the fisheries agreement, which is extended annually as a matter of routine, have recently been halted. The stark contrast in their respective situations is evident when compared. Although the size of the support cannot hastily determine the future success or failure of the ongoing war of aggression and anti-aggression, the general trend indicates that the balance of power will shift from equilibrium to the absolute advantage of the anti-aggressors, and that is generally not a rash judgment. Moreover, all the aggressor nations have successively entered the final stages of reaching their peak and beginning to decline.

However, amidst this generally optimistic situation, there are still some issues worthy of vigilance; if the world is too optimistic about the improvement of the international situation and neglects the current difficulties, it will inevitably increase the dangers ahead and weaken or delay the effort to correct the chaos and restore order. Why do we say this? First, even if the US's "War Materiel Outflow Act" is quickly and smoothly passed by Congress, the US's national economic institutions and industrial system are still insufficient to meet the demands of wartime provisioning. It is said that the large-scale supply of war materiel to various democratic nations will not be fully implemented until after July of this year. Therefore, the period of the next few months remains a worrisome phase; on the aggressors' side, they will inevitably regard this as the last good opportunity they desperately want to exploit. Second, in international relations, Britain and the United States have consistently failed to completely break down the traditional barriers with the Soviet Union, and therefore cannot exert the effect of jointly sanctioning aggression. The signing of the three agreements between the Soviet Union and Germany cannot immediately be rashly judged as tacit approval by the Soviet side of Germany's use of force in the Balkans, let alone be misinterpreted as support from the Soviet Union for the Axis powers, but it is difficult to say that there is no political tacit understanding between them; moreover, compared to Britain and the United States, the Axis' relationship with the Soviet Union is obviously closer, and the expansion of bilateral economic agreements will inevitably offset a portion of the effect of the British blockade and even the US's aid to Britain. This is a loophole and a weakness, and if it continues for a long time, it will prolong the war disaster and also invisibly increase the burden on the democratic nations. Third, in the US Congress, there is generally no problem in passing the State Department's recommendations, but opinions in the legislature are still complex, and isolated fallacies remain stubbornly held; it is evident that even if the US authorities have broad vision and consider all possibilities, they have still failed to completely overcome the shortsighted and selfish financiers and politicians, and the evolution of the world situation to this point has not yet prompted the awakening of these people. Roosevelt's advocacy of supporting China, Britain, and Greece must also be accompanied by the statement that it will avoid dragging the United States into the war, and although the wording is extremely skillful, the intention is well-meaning. This issue will still require further efforts from enlightened people in the US government and public to correct the errors and rectify the customs. Fourth, since the US's firm attitude and policy were announced, Japanese public opinion has become increasingly noisy, although its emotions, both above and below, initially lack a foundation of agitation and solidity, and all preparations are being made with all-out effort. Its radicals are even more unrestrained in their speech, such as Admiral Isamu Takeshita, who, as a veteran of the navy, actually said that any area with abundant sunshine and a warm climate is where Japan intends to be; their "scheme to advance south" "does not require any explanation of the reason"; and they even despise the military preparedness of the South Seas, saying that they are not worth mentioning; their eagerness to try is already obvious. If the situation in the Balkans undergoes drastic changes following the signing of the Soviet-German agreements, even if that is not the final victory of the Axis powers, it will inevitably simultaneously lead to major disturbances in the South Pacific. Britain and the United States have already made some preparations for this, but the progress is slow, and there are many weaknesses, and they have not yet possessed the decisive ability to curb the disaster; whether this crisis will erupt at present does not depend on the existence of British and American resistance, but mainly on whether the Axis' new plans in Europe succeed.

The increasingly intense international crisis of the past nine years has now brought a glimmer of settlement with the arrival of the new spring of 1941. While deeply encouraged, the world cannot help but feel that the relations of recent evolutions are of great importance, no different from the decisive moment for the brightness and darkness, progress and regress of mankind. The recent steps taken by the United States have made all the aggressors' attempts to ease or restrain the United States no longer have room for maneuver; if they are unwilling to bow their heads and repent, they have no choice but to take risks and seek success. It is expected that the next six months will be a period of fierce struggle and also the last difficult period of the anti-aggression war; because after this, the absolute advantage of the democratic front can be declared certain, and the aggressor nations will no longer have any possibility of succeeding. However, some of the weaknesses that currently exist in the democratic front still require further efforts from the authorities and those concerned with the world's fate.

### US and Britain Reach Agreement: Lease of Naval and Air Bases; Aid to Britain Debated in Congress, Minority of Senators Advocate for Minor Amendments

Washington – Political observers generally believe that the aid to Britain bill will pass both houses of Congress, but the Republican isolationists are prepared to resist some of the proposals. The Republican Party acknowledges the need to grant great power to the President, enabling him to make swift decisions and implement them quickly, but they feel that Roosevelt is acting too impulsively without limits. They fear that this bill will become a tool in the ideological war between democratic and autocratic countries. Former President Hoover commented on the bill, saying that it would lead to a large-scale abandonment of duty by Congress, which is something Congress should consider. To his knowledge, the British Parliament has never made such a concession. Former Republican presidential candidate Dewey also stated that this bill is an attempt to abolish American self-government. However, Senator Payne, the leader of the ruling party, said that the bill would definitely pass without amendments that would harm its essence. This bill is not a blank check; Congress still has the power to allocate funds, so it can control the quantity of aircraft and other supplies provided to Britain. Senator George, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed a different opinion last night, stating that the aid to Britain bill would be amended before passing Congress to ensure that foreign countries borrowing American war materials provide the best possible guarantee within their means. The bill does not currently specify a guarantee, and he wants to include an amendment that stipulates an appropriate guarantee. The President, in his view, should not consider this an obstacle to the main objective of providing aid as quickly as possible. The so-called guarantee does not necessarily have to be money; Britain has raw materials such as tin and rubber, which are all acceptable to the United States. The President is currently spending the weekend at the New Hyde Park, and according to his aides, the President is confident that Congress will grant him the unprecedented powers proposed in the bill. (Reuters, 12th)

Washington – It was revealed here yesterday that a clause in President Roosevelt's aid to Britain program would allow British ships damaged in the war to be armed and repaired in US ports if passed by Congress. This revelation, following the introduction of the aid to Britain program yesterday, has stirred up emotions in Washington. Some believe that if this plan is adopted, the US will move closer to active war. State Department officials believe that this plan contradicts the Hague Neutrality Convention, but others say that the President does not want to be bound by "unilateral international law." It is revealed that this legislative program would empower the President to transport US battleships, destroyers, aircraft carriers, and other military equipment to Britain. It is also revealed that if this program is implemented, US ports will be wide open to arming and repairing the British fleet. Congressional leaders say that the US Congress will take swift action (regardless of whether it has authority or not) to grant the President broad powers to implement his "lease or lend" program of aid to Britain, which was submitted to Congress yesterday. (International News Service, 12th)

Washington – According to official sources last night, Congress is about to pass the proposed full-power aid to Britain program, but the unprecedented powers granted to the President in the original bill must be greatly reduced. The methods of reduction may include setting a strict two-year limit for the President and requiring collateral for leasing military ships, airplanes, and munitions to the US. However, final passage may be preceded by fierce debate in the Senate, as some non-interventionists want to conduct an "anti-dictatorship" movement nationwide through radio addresses. This debate has divided the party ranks; most Republicans in the eastern coastal area have joined the Democratic Party in supporting nationwide aid to Britain, while most opponents of intervention are Republicans and members of the Progressive Party in the Midwest. The administration has adopted a strategy of presenting the most stringent bill, hoping that its opponents will focus on reducing President Roosevelt's power without reducing actual aid to Britain. (International News Service, 12th)

The House Military Committee Requests Review of the War Materials Leasing Bill

Washington – Although the administration submitted the leasing bill to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday, the House Military Affairs Committee yesterday requested a review of the legal basis of the bill. Representative May of Kentucky, a Democrat and chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, said that the bill concerns national defense procedures and that "if the President fully implements the bill, there is a considerable risk that he may completely donate his own naval and land army supplies to others." Senator George of Georgia, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that the bill would be amended in the Senate to stipulate that Britain must provide reasonable guarantees before obtaining military materials. Senator George said that he supports the "purpose" of the bill, but regarding methods of protection, he said, "No matter what is transported abroad, there must be a written guarantee of some kind included in the bill. I believe this provision will be included in the bill when it is passed by the Senate." He also said that "the guarantee does not necessarily have to be money." (Associated Press, 12th)

It is said that various facilities such as small auxiliary airfields, docks, and military supplies can be provided. (International News, 12th)

Ottawa – It is reported that the Canadian government will soon announce plans to build several aviation bases between the US border and Alaska, which will be built by Canada but can be used by US military aircraft flying between the US and Alaska. It is now believed that this measure was recommended by the US-Canada Defense Committee. The bases will be spread across northern Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, and Alaska. (Reuters, 12th)

Eight US Bases to Be Built on British Islands in the Western Hemisphere

Washington – The United States and Britain have agreed to establish eight US naval and air bases on British territory in the Western Hemisphere. The formal ninety-nine-year lease agreement will be signed after the US delegation, which is scheduled to depart for Britain soon to discuss technical details with British officials, completes its mission. (Reuters, 12th)

New York – It is reported here that the British Embassy in the United States has submitted a new request to the US government, hoping that the United States will provide Britain with more destroyers and light cruisers. It is reported that the US Navy Department opposes this measure, and Navy Secretary Knox fears that the strength of the US Navy will be weakened as a result. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

The US-Owned Island of Saint Lucia: Of Extreme Military Value

Washington – Among the eight naval and air bases that Britain has leased to the United States under the famous destroyer-for-bases deal, the island of Saint Lucia is particularly useful to the United States. The activities of Americans dedicated to preventing the French island of Martinique from falling into German hands have been going on for several weeks. Unreleased diplomatic documents, the US Navy's undisclosed operations in the frozen Caribbean, and other secret information have enabled Europe, the United States, and South American countries that signed the Havana Agreement to prepare to prohibit the transfer of sovereignty over Martinique to other European countries. In this situation, Saint Lucia, only 24 miles from Martinique, has also attracted international attention. If a certain European country takes any action in Martinique, the same reaction will inevitably occur in Saint Lucia. Even as a naval port, Saint Lucia is already of great use to the outer defense of the United States around the Caribbean Sea. Because Saint Lucia is close to Martinique, the island has suddenly attracted people's attention. This is an unprecedented trend in the history of the Antilles. Since Columbus discovered the island in 1502, it has been the center of military and naval operations and the political reactions during every European dispute. During the French Revolution, the island was transferred from French to British hands, and then from British to French hands several times. Historically, the island's importance has been due to its strategic location on the edge of the Caribbean Sea and the presence of good ports in Castries and Soufrière Bay. But there are also political reasons, as the island was the meeting place for Anglo-French colonial competition in the Antilles in previous centuries. On one side was French Martinique, and on the other was British Saint Lucia. Once Britain and France clashed in Europe, Martinique and Saint Lucia would become battlegrounds. If Britain and France remain allies and fight side by side in this European war, there will be no problems in the Antilles. Since Germany's conquest of France, French territories in the Western Hemisphere have become a concern not only for Britain but also for the United States. As a result, military experts and even ordinary people have realized the true value of Saint Lucia to the United States once the European war spreads to the Caribbean. (Associated Press, 12th)

Hanoi – Thai aircraft attacked the Vietnamese border towns of Ta Kai Tuo and Savannakhet on Friday. Recently, these two places have been the targets of attacks by Thai artillery across the Mekong River. Informed sources say that French anti-aircraft fire eventually drove the Thai aircraft away. It is also learned that the new commander-in-chief of Vietnam, General Matern, will arrive in Saigon on Sunday to succeed General Martin, who will return to France within a few days. (Associated Press, 12th)

Hanoi – An official communiqué recently released states that (1) our aircraft bombed the Thai cities of Sakon Nakhon and Korat today in retaliation for repeated violations of our border by Thai troops, achieving considerable success. (2) Our artillery fire also destroyed the artillery positions in Mok Town west of Savannakhet and the gendarmerie post in Saya Mong. At the same time, the Thai artillery west of Viet Zeng was also hit hard, rendering it almost unusable. (3) In addition, it is confirmed that Thai troops attacked our Cambodian state on the 4th and 5th of this month, but were repelled by our troops and suffered heavy losses in the Beling area.

Bangkok – A communiqué from the Thai Supreme Command recently stated that the Thai air force and army jointly attacked Vietnamese troops in the Aranyaprathet area on Saturday. However, the communiqué did not provide details of the attack. Bangkok Radio has called on the French to stop shooting, saying, "If you stop shooting, then we will..." Bangkok Radio also asked the French to send representatives to discuss adjusting border issues, otherwise Thailand will continue the war until victory. The radio also said that Thai aircraft did not bomb Saigon and Nong Khai because those two cities have not yet established proper defenses and many Thai aircraft are still there. The radio told Saigon Radio that Saigon had prepared to receive Thai aircraft bombs and requested a quick reply, stating that they could no longer wait. The Thai Supreme Command stated that after a fierce artillery exchange on Saturday between the Thai artillery in Mai Phanthun and the French artillery in Savannakhet, the French artillery in that area had been silenced. (Associated Press, 12th)

French Deploy Defenses on the Border

Vichy – Regarding the Thai-Vietnamese border conflict, semi-official sources here recently released information stating that the French army in Vietnam is deploying a defense line 20 miles from the border. The Thai army's attacks are nothing more than attacks on some outposts in this 20-mile "no-man's zone." Although the seriousness of the situation on the Vietnamese border is well understood here, the news coming from foreign sources recently is completely inconsistent with the reports received from Hanoi, which is undeniable. It has been found that the Thai government recently purchased many of the latest aircraft from abroad. The French air force in Vietnam is fighting these aircraft. The foreign aid received by Thailand is varied. These new aircraft are just one part of that aid. (Havas, 11th)

Hanoi – An official communiqué recently released stated: (1) Our aircraft again flew to Thailand today and bombed the towns of Slaket and Prachin Buri in retaliation. (2) Clashes occurred between reconnaissance units of both sides in Yang Tang Gon, 15 miles northeast of Poipet, and in Krabei, 6 miles outside Poipet. The Thai troops in both places were repelled by our forces. At the same time, an encounter also occurred north of Samrong. (3) After our aircraft bombed Ubon Ratchathani, Sisaket, Korat, Prachin Buri, and Slaket yesterday, an air battle occurred over our city of Xieng Lieb. Two Thai aircraft were shot down by our forces. (4) Thai aircraft attempted to bomb our outposts along the Mekong River, but were repelled by our anti-aircraft artillery. (5) Another team of Thai aircraft dropped two bombs in our town of Ta Khaek and four bombs in the town of Geng Ka Bo, 12 miles north of Savannakhet. There were no losses or casualties. (Havas, 11th)

### Another Victory for Soviet Diplomacy: Containing Germany's Southern Advance Plan. The Soviet Union is Willing to Maintain Friendship with Neighboring Countries; The German-Soviet Agreement is Not Directed at a Third Country

Washington - Well-informed diplomatic circles here predicted yesterday that the true beneficiaries of the expanded German-Soviet trade agreement are Turkey and Bulgaria. If this prediction is correct, the Soviet guarantee to supply Germany with increased quantities of oil, meat, and machinery is the reward Germany received from the Soviet Union for abandoning or temporarily shelving its plan to reach the Dardanelles via Turkey and Bulgaria. Diplomatic circles here also believe that the Soviet statement that "various economic problems" between Germany and the Soviet Union have been resolved also benefits Britain. It is asserted that once Germany seizes the Dardanelles, it could then directly threaten British-owned Iranian oil fields or the Suez Canal, or even attack both simultaneously. According to diplomatic circles here, if the Soviet Union "buys off" Germany, preventing it from attacking the Dardanelles, then Britain's dominance in the Mediterranean can be maintained for a while because Germany will not be able to block the Suez Canal's outlet to the Mediterranean. Military experts say that Berlin's announcement that German aircraft would assist Italy in attacking British fleets in the Strait of Sicily can also prove that Germany has temporarily shelved its Balkan invasion plan aimed at the Dardanelles, Iran, or the Suez Canal. They believe this move is Germany's attempt to use air raids to loosen the British naval blockade of the Mediterranean. These air raids will definitely depart from Italian bases. The traditional Soviet policy is to prohibit any major power from dominating the Mediterranean and to prevent European powers from reaching the Dardanelles from the Black Sea gateway. Therefore, diplomatic circles doubt that Germany will necessarily occupy Bulgaria and Turkey. (International Telegram, 12th)

Moscow - Yesterday, "Pravda" commented on welcoming the German-Soviet trade agreement, stating that the Soviet Union's foreign policy and its policy of strengthening commercial relations with various countries are now increasing the Soviet Union's economic strength and strengthening the Soviet Union's international influence. The Soviet Union is willing to promote this kind of relationship with all neighboring countries that understand economic and trade relations, it said. "Izvestia" also published an editorial stating that the German-Soviet agreement is not aimed at a third country, so no one can object to this latest agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union because the Soviet government concluded economic agreements with other warring and neutral countries in 1940 and is willing to sign similar agreements with other countries this year. Other countries should understand that it is time for the Soviet Union to maintain its own independent policy as a non-belligerent country, it said. Other newspapers also regarded the German-Soviet agreement as another victory for Soviet foreign policy and said that a new development in German-Soviet friendly relations has now been achieved. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)

Moscow - "Pravda" recently published an article titled "New Victory for Soviet Foreign Policy," elaborating on the important significance of the new German-Soviet agreement. The newspaper said, "This action is extremely important for the country and internationally. Its importance is not limited to the content of the agreement. The conclusion of this agreement is sufficient to show that the friendly relations between the German and Soviet peoples have been further consolidated. It also proves that since the signing of the non-aggression pact on August 23, 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union have continued to successfully resolve various issues. The German-Soviet border agreement and the agreements concluded in Riga and Kaunas are the result of the implementation of the Soviet Union's peace policy. This policy is based on the great Lenin-Stalin ideology and is now being continued by the Soviet government."

"Stalin stated at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, 'We advocate peace and strengthen relations with all countries. This is our attitude. If any country does not attempt to infringe upon our country's interests, we will continue to adopt this attitude.' The conclusion of this new German-Soviet agreement is sufficient to prove that the above-mentioned great foreign policy has achieved victory. At a time when the borders of various countries and the countries themselves have been destroyed by gunfire, the borders of the Soviet Union can remain unwavering due to the bravery of the army, the unity of the people, and the wisdom of its diplomatic policy. The agreement of January 10, 1941, completely resolved the German-Soviet border issue. This border stretches from the Igarka River to the Baltic Sea. The agreement also confirms the legal relationship between the German and Soviet borders and the lasting nature of friendly relations between the two countries. In addition, the new agreement has a direct connection with the border agreement of August 31, 1940, and will enable German-Soviet relations to be further developed based on the non-aggression pact. The head of the Soviet government, Molotov, once said, 'The creation of German-Soviet friendly relations is by no means a temporary phenomenon. This kind of friendly relationship is actually promoted by the fundamental interests of both countries.' This statement has been confirmed by the new agreement. In fact, the fact that various new German-Soviet agreements can be completed in a very short period of time proves the accuracy of Molotov's statement."

"What is particularly worthy of discussion is the economic agreement. According to yesterday's communique, the agreement is an expanded agreement that will enable the economic plans of Germany and the Soviet Union to be further developed, which is extremely beneficial to both countries. The enemies of the Soviet Union are trying to alienate Germany and the Soviet Union and provoke the emotions of the two peoples. However, the Soviet Union still maintains a peaceful policy towards Germany and other friendly nations. Molotov stated at the Sixth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, 'War provokers, for the sake of their own imperialist interests, are eager for us to adopt a policy of hostility towards Germany. These gentlemen must know that the Soviet Union is never to be used by others. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is to consolidate relations with all friendly countries. Whether it is in strengthening the economy or improving its international status, there are achievements every year. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is purely based on the interests of the people. The Soviet Union is eager to develop economic and trade relations with any country that can estimate the importance of conducting trade with the Soviet Union. Regarding this point, the agreement signed on the 10th of this month has clarified it." As for the agreement on immigration and the rights of joint industries between the two countries, it is also very important. The agreement stipulates compensation for German property losses in the three Republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, etc. In short, the property issues that could not be resolved by the previous immigration agreements between the three Republics of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania and Germany have now been resolved. The Soviet people unanimously and enthusiastically support the Soviet government and also support the government's wise peace policy because this policy can indeed consolidate the political and economic strength of our motherland and protect our sacred and inviolable borders. In conclusion, the three agreements signed can be called a new victory for the Soviet Union's peace policy. Under the guidance of the wise and victorious Lenin-Stalin party, the Soviet government continues to adopt the above-mentioned peace policy." (TASS Telegram, 12th)

### German-Soviet Celebration

Moscow - Soviet Russian People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov held a banquet last night to celebrate with German Ambassador to Russia Schulenburg, Dr. Schaur, head of the German economic delegation, as well as counselors and secretaries of the German embassy and their wives. On the Russian side, those invited to attend included Vice Chairman of the People's Committee Mikoyan, Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Krutikov, and many representatives from the Foreign Affairs, National Defense, and Foreign Trade Committees. This banquet was related to the celebration of the German-Soviet economic agreement. (Haitong Telegram, 12th)

Berlin - German officials believe that the German-Soviet economic agreement is a continuation of the German-Soviet trade agreement of February 11, 1940. German companies have received orders from the Soviet Union based on the new agreement. Payment for the goods will be made through a clearing system. The quotas for goods have not been announced, but a portion of these quotas has indeed increased, and the rest will also be revised. The transportation methods have not changed. Ten railway lines and the Baltic Sea and Danube River can all be used to transport goods. The Soviet Union has also permitted German goods to transit to other countries. (Haitong News Agency Telegram, 12th)

Rome - After Germany and the Soviet Union signed various agreements, people here regarded it as evidence that the relationship between the Axis countries and the Soviet Union was gradually normalizing, rather than a surprising diplomatic move. From Italy's standpoint, the signing of this agreement is beneficial to Soviet-Italian economic relations because the quotas for the exchange of goods between the two countries will be revised.

### Tobruk is Isolated; British Army Bombs; Vanguard Forces Advance Westward to Benghazi; Italian Casualties and Captures Now Total 80,000

Cairo - General Headquarters announced that the battle of Tobruk is proceeding smoothly. Since the British army began its general offensive in Libya, the total progress of its advance has been 230 miles. (United Press Telegram, 12th)

Correspondent with the Tobruk Army - Tobruk, the strong fortress of Italy in North Africa, is now being intensely bombed by the British army because a large number of fresh artillery units of the British army have arrived. The British army's mobile forces have already cut off the traffic from Tobruk to Derna, isolating Tobruk. Now, they are advancing westward to Benghazi to prevent the Italian army in Tobruk from breaking out. General Bergonsuli, the commander of the Italian army who previously defended Bardia, seems to have escaped after listening to the confessions of British prisoners. The Italian army losses were the following nine divisions: the 1st and 2nd Libyan Divisions, the Maraireh Desert Army, the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Blackshirt Divisions, the 64th Catanzaro Division, and the 62nd and 63rd Cirene Divisions. (United Press Telegram, 12th)

Cairo - The British Army General Headquarters announced yesterday afternoon that since the start of the British army's offensive in the western desert, the Italian army's losses, including those killed, wounded, and captured, have been no less than 80,000, including 1,250 officers. One senior officer was killed and eight were captured. Among the British army's spoils of war are 41 medium tanks, 162 small tanks, 589 artillery pieces, 300,000 rounds of ammunition, more than 600 machine guns, 700 light artillery pieces, 11 million rounds of small artillery shells and machine gun bullets, and 1,700 trucks. However, most of them are no longer usable. In addition, many military supplies were seized. In the Battle of Bardia alone, the Italian side had a total of 2,041 officers killed and captured, and 42,827 soldiers. Among the military equipment lost were 462 artillery pieces, 120 tanks, and 708 transport trucks. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)

London - The total number of Italian soldiers killed and captured in Bardia reached 44,868, which is larger than initially expected by officials in London. However, after studying the captured soldiers, the reason is also quite simple. Bardia was the frontline base of the Italian army. In addition to the combat troops, there were also a large number of personnel handling industrial hygiene and other work related to the military base. The number of these personnel was very large, which was not taken into account when the Central Office initially estimated the strength of Bardia. Therefore, the estimated number differs from the actual number of prisoners by nearly 10,000. The figure of 44,868 can now be regarded as including the entire Bardia garrison because it seems that very few Italian soldiers escaped the encirclement. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)

Superior British Air Force Moves to the Front Line to Coordinate with the Army in Attacking the Enemy

Cairo - As the British Army advances rapidly westward, crossing the Libyan desert, the British Air Force has also moved to the advanced base to coordinate with the Army and attack the enemy from nearby. The absence of the Italian Air Force is a notable point in the recent battles. The claim from Rome that Italian bombers destroyed British mechanized units seems to be unfounded. The British military report has not yet confirmed it. Both sides have withdrawn their aircraft and pilots to airfields further west. This must be the reason for the current inactivity of Italian aircraft. However, British bombers are now bombing Italian airfields day and night, not giving the Italian Air Force a chance to rest. Italian Commander-in-Chief Graziani may now want his airmen to rest temporarily in order to work hard in the future. I must admit the superiority of the British Air Force due to the lack of supply of manpower and resources. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)

A British Air Force communiqué from Cairo stated that on the night of January 9, British bombers went on a mission to bomb enemy airfields in Benina and Berka in Africa. The runways, hangars, and aircraft scattered on the ground at the Benina airfield were hit by bombs, causing fires and explosions. Many aircraft at the Berka airfield were also bombed, and barracks and hangars were also heavily damaged. British fighters patrolled incessantly in the Tobruk area, but no major battles occurred. Italian troops and mechanized units retreating from Klisura in Albania were severely attacked by British aircraft on Friday. British aircraft discovered a large Italian army unit retreating north of Klisura and immediately dropped bombs, which exploded nearby. British aircraft also attacked the Gabrooni factory in Italian East Africa, causing fires in several areas within the target area. Many houses in the Asmara area were also hit by bombs and caught fire. British aircraft also made dive-bombing attacks on Italian army assembly points. On January 9, the South African Air Force attacked the Yavello airfield in Abyssinia, dropping many bombs, causing the fire to spread throughout the airfield, destroying two Italian aircraft, and damaging the remaining aircraft. All British aircraft returned safely to base. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)

British Forces Launch Offensive in East Africa, Capturing El Wak Fortress

London - According to reliable sources in London last night, before capturing the El Wak fortress in Kenya, the British army first ambushed a tank force in the jungle at dawn. Although Italian machine guns fired at them, injuring four people, the British tank force did not return fire, so the Italian army did not know the truth. Shortly thereafter, troops from the Gold Coast arrived in front of the Italian army's position, which was heavily protected by barbed wire. The British artillery, four miles away, also bombarded the enemy position for more than ten minutes. The British tank force then rushed out of the jungle on the left and attacked with infantry along the entire line. The infantry's engineering team blew a ten-yard gap in the enemy's barbed wire, and the tanks rushed in through this gap. The infantry from the Gold Coast also charged in. The Italian army was caught off guard and abandoned its artillery and machine guns, fleeing in droves. Only two people armed with guns resisted, and both were killed. British tanks attacked everywhere, destroying their buildings. This battle yielded a lot of spoils, including four two-inch caliber artillery pieces. The Italian army initially thought that tanks could not be used due to the rugged terrain, so they panicked and were unable to resist when they suddenly saw the tanks attacking. According to reports from Nairobi, although British tanks were shot at by guns and artillery, the tank bodies were strong and only the steel plates were slightly cracked. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)

Johannesburg - South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts said in a speech yesterday that British and South African troops would launch an offensive against Italian troops in Abyssinia and British Somaliland. He said that we are bogging down a large Italian army in the desert between Kenya and Abyssinia, preventing them from being transferred. Their number is at least equal to that broken by General Wavell. If the South African army did not contain them, these 200,000 Italian troops would be transferred to the north and become General Wavell's great sigh. Now the time for action has come. Our work in 1941 is to wipe out the enemy not only in Abyssinia but also in British Somaliland. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)

### Nazi Aircraft Launch Fire Attack, London Suffers Another Unprecedented Holocaust; Thousands of Incendiary Bombs Dropped, Large Fires Erupt; Civil Defense Teams Mobilized to Quickly Extinguish Fires

London - At 7:10 last night, London's anti-aircraft guns sounded loudly. Fifteen minutes later, German aircraft dropped thousands of incendiary bombs, as dense as raindrops. This air raid was extremely fierce and rapid. By 10:00 PM, the German aircraft had returned. Some speculated that it was due to a sudden change in the weather in the area of the German aircraft base within France at that time. Many people in London stood on the roofs of buildings to watch the fire, calling it the largest fire since last September. After the event, the streets of London were piled with rubble. (United Press Telegram, 12th)

London - Enemy aircraft attempted to launch another fierce attack on the city of London last night, dropping thousands of incendiary bombs, but most of them were quickly extinguished by civil defense teams, national defense teams, and fire brigades. One firefighter said that as soon as an incendiary bomb landed, firefighters would appear, and rooftop watchmen would shout out the location where the bomb landed to the fire brigade, so the fire brigade was able to extinguish the bomb before it spread to the buildings. Enemy aircraft are still using their usual tactic of dropping incendiary bombs first and then dropping high-explosive bombs. As soon as enemy bombers were discovered in the sky, British fighters took off to pursue them. Yesterday's white book stated that there was little activity in the British sky. In the afternoon, enemy aircraft dropped bombs on a town in East Kent, destroying some houses and causing minor casualties to residents. The War Department recently stated that the National Defence Corps will be used to deal with incendiary bombs in the future. Some areas will use the National Defence Corps as special patrol teams so that they can quickly provide assistance when needed. However, this method is temporary. It will be terminated after the new organization that penetrates the platform and the organized fire prevention team are perfected. (Reuters Telegram, 12th)

London - German fire-bombing raid on London last night. Fortunately, thousands of fire guard men and women bravely fought to extinguish the fires, and London was spared the encirclement of flames. New types of fire bombs fell on the city, and many fire guards were killed and injured. Several tons of building debris were scattered in various parks and streets. Many London residents were also killed and injured. Churches, shops, residential buildings, and large buildings were destroyed throughout London. After four hours of German bombing, it stopped due to the deteriorating weather and the intense counter-attack by the British Air Force on German air bases on the northwest coast of France. A huge bomb hit a subway passageway where hundreds of people were sheltering. Many were killed, but many were also rescued by rescue teams. A row of multi-story houses, full of people, was completely destroyed by an incendiary bomb. Two German aircraft were shot down. Several large fires were extinguished before midnight. The British Air Force heavily bombed Le Havre and heavily bombed Lorient and Brest. (International Telegram, 12th)

London – In the week ending January 10th, British air raids on Germany and German-occupied territories were limited to only a few days due to poor weather. However, the bombing was quite intense, focusing on enemy docks and ships. The targets included Blayais (which was attacked for three consecutive nights), naval bases, shipyards, factories, railways, and storage yards, all of which sustained heavy damage. The naval docks and harbors of Wilhelmshaven and Emden were bombed for many hours. Due to excellent visibility, many bombs hit their targets. Brest, France, was bombed for three days and nights. In Rotterdam, Holland, an oil depot was hit and caught fire. In Egersund, Norway, an important railway bridge was directly hit. In nineteen attacks on harbors and ships, two focused on oil refineries, three on railways, and several on factories and airfields. A total of four aircraft were lost in these operations, but three German planes were shot down. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)

### Random Notes on the European War (29): Diary of a British Officer on the Western Front

May 20th: General Gamelin, the Allied Commander-in-Chief, has been replaced by Weygand. General Weygand believes that the outcome of the battle can be decided within 24 hours. British bomber squadrons are currently penetrating deep into German territory, but they are not concentrating their full force to bomb the crossings of the Meuse and Wasle rivers to disrupt the German vanguard outposts. Especially at night, we are allowing the German troops to sleep soundly all night long. Because the German army has advanced too quickly, its artillery has not been able to keep up. The Allied artillery has also been either abandoned or transported elsewhere during the retreat, so neither army is currently firing its artillery. The relentless artillery fire that keeps the enemy awake at night can now only be replaced by the air force.

4:00 PM: General Dill and General Longue are here holding a meeting with the Air Force Commander-in-Chief. The entire key to future safety lies in whether we can prevent the Germans from continuing to reinforce their troops, and whether we can launch a powerful flanking counterattack in time to cut the pocket-shaped position between Amiens and Sedan into two segments. According to a telegram from the Air Force Department, they will attack the enemy's supply stations. This target probably refers to places like Ham, east of Eisen. However, to preserve our troops, we must have more immediate assistance.

The efficiency of the German army's operations can be seen from the following intercepted radio message from the German headquarters. The Germans are using completely unencrypted code. One message said, "All bombers proceed to bomb Cambrai." At 2:00 PM, another message was received saying, "All fighters proceed to bomb Arras." At 2:10 PM, a reply from the German front line was intercepted saying, "All fighters have been dispatched."

This speed can be compared to the Allied side's telegraphic procedures. How do we send telegrams? How do we transmit orders by radio? To my personal knowledge, the Allied authorities never use unencrypted code to send telegrams. They transmit orders for immediate dispatch using encrypted code. The person sending the telegram must first translate the order into encrypted code, and the person receiving the telegram must translate the encrypted code back into the text. The procedure is cumbersome, inevitably wasting several hours, and opportunities are fleeting, leading to missed targets. Not only that, whenever we receive urgent news and urgent requests, we must first send a plane to check whether there is a need for it. Sometimes the dispatched plane does not return, so we stand still. Even if the return report confirms the need, the round trip takes time, and even if there is action, it is too late. The secret to victory in battle is very simple: quick decision-making and rapid execution. The German lesson is that it is better to act incorrectly than to sit still.

May 21st: The German army has advanced from Belgium to Boulogne on the English Channel, cutting the Allied forces into two segments. Calais has been set on fire. The counterattack to close the pocket has so far produced no results. One of the pilots dispatched by the Air Force Headquarters has just returned. The French army was originally scheduled to launch a counterattack at dawn today in the area of Arras, Cambrai, the Cambrai road, and Bapaume. He departed at 5:00 AM to inspect the area. The report he obtained suggests that France seems to be following Poland's path, to be conquered by the enemy in three weeks.

3:00 PM: I heard that the British and Belgian armies have won a counterattack, but it is only a local victory, small in scale and insufficient to affect the final outcome.

The French lack imagination. They have never used landmines and hand grenades to destroy advancing German mechanized units. They have also never used military blankets to wrap makeshift bombs, so that enemy tanks are surrounded by flames when they explode. Neither junior officers nor soldiers have any initiative or adventurous spirit. They rely wholeheartedly on the Maginot Line, believing themselves to be as secure as a rock, and their initiative has completely disappeared.

May 22nd: The French army has still not launched a counterattack, and a good opportunity has been missed. General Georges was questioned by the British army as to why the counterattack he had authorized was so slow to materialize. His liaison officer defended him, saying that he could not overrule the opinions of the various divisions and issue orders without their consent. This statement is astonishing. Only now do I realize that the soldiers' committees talked about in the French army by the Blum cabinet in 1936 have greatly undermined military discipline. The ranks are filled with the spirit of internationalism, which hinders the headquarters in everything and greatly impedes its actions. Today, I also learned from a French officer that one-third of the French army is recruited from the densely populated northern France. Now that it is in German hands, one in three French soldiers is homeless. Man's love for his home is innate. Now that they have lost their homes and everything they own, how can they have the heart to fight?

The British army's only armored division landed in France yesterday and will depart from Rouen to compete with the German tank corps. However, the enemy's strength is too disparate!

### British Air Force Assists Greece in Pursuing Retreating Italian Troops; Enemy Remnants North of Kleisoura Eliminated; Italian Troops Launch Three Counterattacks Along the Coast Without Success

Athens – The Greek High Command announced (today) that as the Italian troops retreated from Kleisoura, they were fiercely pursued by the British Air Force. Later, it was announced that the Greek army had eliminated the remaining enemy north of Kleisoura and had achieved a new victory. It is reported that many new prisoners have been captured, and a large number of military weapons, ammunition, food, etc. have been seized. 20,000 Italian troops retreating from Kleisoura were trapped at the narrow first point on the Berat road and suffered heavy casualties from British air raids and strafing. It is reported that the broken tanks and motor transport vehicles of the vanguard blocked the road. The Greek army on the northeast line advanced through heavy rain. Although the Italian artillery fire was fierce, the Greek army still occupied several strategic high points in Giermani. It is reported that the village of Obali in the Moschopolis area has also been occupied by the Greek army, but the Devol River has not yet been crossed. According to news from Budapest, the Italian army launched a fierce artillery attack and has driven the Greek army out of Pogradec, but this news has not been confirmed today. (International News Agency dispatch of the 12th)

Struga – According to frontline reports arriving here yesterday, the Greek army has repulsed the three determined attacks by the Italian mechanized units on the Greek positions in the Dujakat area (Dujakat is located on the main Albanian coast road leading to Vlora). At the same time, six British and Greek aircraft bombed Vlora, damaging the coastal engineering there. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)

### Göring Delivers Speech to Miners; Urges Efforts to Increase Production to Strive for Final Victory

Berlin – When German Marshal Göring awarded the War Merit Cross to 470 miners, he delivered a speech stating that Germany's slogan is "Armaments and War." Germany's grand arms industry plan, to develop domestic raw materials to avoid dependence on foreign countries, has gradually seen success. In contrast, Britain relies on foreign countries for its arms and food, requiring two or three hundred ships to transport them back and forth every day. In addition to protecting the country, the German Air Force can continuously attack the enemy. The number of bombs dropped daily reaches 180,000 to 240,000, while British planes drop only 200 to 600 bombs on German territory every night. If we believe what is written in the British newspapers, Britain would have already won. Although German factories have been disturbed, they have never stopped working. As for the suffering endured by the major cities in Britain, one can imagine the enemy's situation. German planes attack Britain in formations of three to five hundred, while British planes attack Germany in formations of only twenty to thirty. Moreover, the bombs carried by German planes are ten times heavier than those carried by British planes. The distance to fly to London is ten times shorter than the distance for British planes to fly to Berlin. The output of military supplies is definitely superior to that of the enemy, so we should have no doubts about Germany's victory. The volume and speed of our arms production have not changed in the slightest. The enemy's production losses have reached 60% to 70%, and total output has fallen to 50%. I have extremely high demands on you. The task is difficult, but we will overcome all difficulties, and this work can also succeed. What I require is that during the war, every soldier must fight and every worker must work twice as hard. Last year, Germany produced 500 million tons of coal, while the rest of the world produced only twice that amount. This is your amazing contribution, which almost no one dares to believe. The output of iron ore, potash, and mineral oil has increased several times compared to previous years. This is the result of the workers' unremitting efforts. These indispensable raw materials are the basis for our country's cultural prosperity and survival, and are more important than gold. In the four-year plan, coal is the most important raw material, and many chemicals are made from coal. Artificial textiles also come from coal. Its uses are so extensive that it is hard to imagine. The work of miners is no different from that of soldiers on the front line. Without skilled miners, Germany's industry would not be free, and Germany would have no national defense.

### Germany Launches in Europe; Japan Will Surely Respond; Observations of the Chongqing Newspaper

Chongqing – The "Central Daily News" special diplomatic correspondent predicts that Germany will soon launch offensives simultaneously in both Europe and Asia, stating that Germany's attack in the Balkans will encounter resistance from Bulgaria and Greece and may cause conflicts of interest between Germany and the Soviet Union. At the same time that Germany is acting in Europe, Japan will also be active in the Pacific and South Pacific, first to implement its southward advance plan and second to support Germany. Japan is encouraging Thailand to attack southern Vietnam and will seize the opportunity to capture Saigon and South Vietnam. The correspondent attaches great importance to the arrival of a large number of German representatives in Japan and the Japanese military commission's visit to Berlin, believing that Germany and Japan will soon intensify their submarine strategy in the South Pacific. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)

Berlin – German Propaganda Minister Goebbels held a radio conversation with Japanese intelligence officer Ito yesterday, discussing the close cooperation between the Axis powers and Japan, lasting for half an hour. (Haitong dispatch of the 12th)

Tokyo – Japanese Lieutenant General Horiuchi expressed his views in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun, stating that Japan's assistance to Germany should be as enthusiastic as the United States' assistance to Britain. Although the United States has declared neutrality, its level of assistance to Britain is as if it has joined the war. As for the relationship between Japan and Germany, it is limited to exchanging New Year's greetings. The government should immediately organize a Japanese youth volunteer corps to be sent to Germany. (Haitong dispatch of the 12th)

### British Universities Establish Lecture Series to Discuss Far East Events

London – British universities, at the request of the London China Committee, have scheduled to open a special lecture series at the end of this week for Asian students. The lecturers will be former British Consul-General in Shanghai, Pratt, and Honorary Secretary of the British Academy, Dawson. Dawson's topic is "The Reconstruction of Bombed Cities," which is in response to the request of Chinese students. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)

### Anglo-German Economic Warfare Will Become Increasingly Intense

London – British Minister of Economic Warfare Dalton said in a speech in Auckland yesterday that in the last two days, the navy has intercepted many ships loaded with goods attempting to break through the British blockade. He will use the cooperation of the navy and air force to vigorously intensify all forms of economic warfare. In the coming months or weeks, the war will become increasingly intense. There is no doubt about this, because Hitler cannot remain passive while Italy is suffering heavy losses in Africa and Albania. Hitler and Mussolini are bound to cope with the increasing pressure of the British blockade and the material and moral assistance that the United States is providing to Britain. President Roosevelt's recent remarks will surely inspire all those in the world who love freedom and uphold justice. Dalton continued by saying that the British government, at the request of the US President, has decided to allow certain supplies to pass through the British blockade to the occupied areas of France, saying that there will be strict restrictions on this method to prevent its abuse. If any violations of the conditions are found, the British government still has the right to prevent its passage. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)

### US Announces Last Year's Gold and Silver Production in the Philippines

Washington – The US Treasury Department announced yesterday the gold and silver production in the Philippines in 1940, stating that the Philippines produced 1,111,697 ounces of gold, valued at US$30,909,400, and 1,303,100 ounces of silver, valued at US$926,634. (United Press dispatch of the 12th)

### The Reform Problem of Our Country's Financial Institutions After the War (Part 2)

— Wang Yutong

The Concentration of National Capital and the Bank Merger Movement

In today's advanced countries, financial strength is invariably concentrated under sound systems, and the concentration of capital and the bank merger movement are extremely closely related. Great Britain promoted bank mergers to strengthen its country in 1884, and during the First World War, it continued to make every effort. In 1919, the famous merger of the Manchester & Liverpool District Bank was recorded in financial history. The United States implemented a large-scale bank merger in the spring of 1929; after the financial panic of 1927 in Japan, large and small banks underwent a thorough merger movement. The capital of Chinese banks ranges from an average of 250,000 yuan to a maximum of 10,000,000 yuan for the Central Bank. Compared with the financial strength of banks in other countries, the difference is vast. The actual strength of Chinese banks is small. In ordinary times, if a single bank undertakes a large-scale investment project, its strength is insufficient. If it seeks to unite with its peers, it is constrained by circumstances and difficult to realize. As a result, foreign banks often seize the opportunity, which has been a common occurrence in the past. This is one point. Moreover, small-capital banks struggle to survive in ordinary times and already feel exhausted. If, unfortunately, a financial panic occurs, the banks will bear the brunt. Those with weak financial strength will inevitably be overwhelmed and their weaknesses exposed. At this time, the impact on the banks themselves is small, but the repercussions on the social economy are significant. This is the second point. The organization and operations of commercial banks are common knowledge and need not be detailed. However, based on past painful experiences, and considering the proliferation of speculative small banks in the country, which not only do not contribute to the overall commercial finance, but often participate in various speculative activities contrary to it, disregarding national interests and acting in complete opposition, such as the rubber stock, real estate, margin trading, and government bond transactions of the past. Although the domestic banking business has appeared to make great progress in the past decade, in reality, its foundation is almost entirely built on speculative activities. In the years before the August 13th Incident, government bond trading and real estate operations were important businesses for general commercial banks. After the currency system reform, taking advantage of the domestic price fluctuations, they engaged in commodity speculation. After the outbreak of this war, the government advocated active economic construction to strengthen the resistance. Therefore, the inland areas were in urgent need of a large influx of funds, but financial institutions still flocked to Shanghai, and remained hesitant and cautious about participating in economic activities in the rear, often only engaging in superficial publicity. In the end, they all tended towards: (1) buying and selling foreign exchange and arbitrage; (2) investing in commodities or accepting mortgages on goods; (3) buying and selling foreign stocks in Shanghai and rubber stocks in Southeast Asia; (4) investing in American stocks and commodities such as cotton, wheat, and metals; (5) buying and selling domestic government bonds on the black market; (6) investing in real estate. The astonishing profits made by various banks last year were all thanks to the aforementioned foreign exchange trading and other transactions. The speculative fever among the general public was also indirectly fueled by the banks. Therefore, the first step after the war should be for the government to strictly restrict the establishment of ordinary commercial banks, and to establish new basic principles for approval. For existing banks with unsound internal organizations, they should be urged to reorganize or be dissolved. Those with similar objectives or business natures should be ordered to merge with each other, so as to concentrate their strength to establish a foundation for self-reliance and self-defense, and to strive for capital concentration and unified objectives, so that the credit system becomes more consolidated. This is particularly suitable for China's post-war financial policy. Moreover, the function of bank mergers is very great, and to list the most obvious ones: (1) increasing bank credit; (2) diversifying risk; (3) preventing unfair competition; (4) ensuring the safety of bank operations.

Promoting Industrial and Commercial Prosperity and Implementing a Low-Interest Rate Policy

The low-interest rate issue is an important financial policy for our country in the future. In the early years, I strongly advocated its active promotion. However, at that time, our country's financial organization was not sound, and the objective conditions such as the business and personnel of financial institutions were also difficult to match, resulting in too great a gap between theory and reality. In the autumn of the 25th year of the Republic of China, when the Chinese Economic Society held its annual meeting in Shanghai, the economic problems of the extraordinary period were the focus of academic discussion. When I attended the discussion on China's financial problems, I still emphasized the importance of the low-interest rate issue, but all of this was only an exploration of academic theory in the past.

Since the beginning of our country's modern financial industry, although the scale has been roughly established, speculative fever such as credit crises, government bonds, real estate, and margin trading has caused the still nascent financial industry to suffer ruthless setbacks. In recent years, the proliferation of weak banks has competed to use high interest rates as the only tool to attract customers, leading to the failure of capital to obtain normal use. Banks have thus lost their ability to regulate the social economy and facilitate national finance, only allowing speculative activities to flourish and industry to have no way to develop. The outlet for bank funds has become increasingly narrow. This situation has existed for a long time and need not be repeatedly described. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, except for a corner of Shanghai, where industry and commerce have shown a distorted wartime state; in terms of the trend of the entire financial market, it seems to have suddenly changed its old appearance, each invigorating itself, and unanimously advancing towards the great goal of assisting economic construction. This is something to be congratulated for the future of Chinese finance. However, the excessively high interest rate of funds has ultimately become the biggest obstacle to all economic undertakings. It is clear that the reduction of interest rates has become the most urgent financial problem in the future!

In recent years, with the reduction in the need for funds in various countries and the sluggish financial situation, international finance has had a consistent trend of reducing interest rate policies. The downward trend of discount rates of central banks in various countries from 1930 to the present is shown in the following table:

From the content of the above table, it can be seen that the interest rates of various countries have indeed shown a downward trend in the past ten years, but in recent months, there has been a tendency to rebound. This must be attributed to the outbreak of the European War. If the world can be free from wars and large-scale destruction of property in the future, the trend of interest rates declining day by day seems predictable. Considering that the interest rate in China's financial market is too high, there are several key points: (1) The business of most banks in China relies heavily on foreign deposits. If banks do not reduce deposit interest rates, it is not easy to reduce loan interest rates. However, reducing deposit interest rates will make it difficult for banks to absorb deposits. This is one of the reasons hindering the low-interest rate policy. (2) Most of the loans from Chinese banks are fixed. Fixed loans easily make funds stagnant, resulting in fewer transfers of capital and lower yields. Therefore, in terms of the number of capital transfers and the degree of risk, it is difficult to thoroughly lower the general interest rate; (3) Although the establishment of China's central bank has a considerable history, the central bank and the general financial market have not been able to maintain a close relationship so far. Since it is unable to exercise its function of controlling finance, how can it achieve the lowering of interest rates through normal channels like other countries? (4) The excessively high interest rate of government bonds is also the biggest influence. In the winter of the 24th year, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to gradually reduce the market interest rate based on the social and economic situation, and at the request of the Shanghai Money Industry Association, appropriately reduced the 8% interest rate on the outstanding financial bonds of the 24th year. This was the beginning of the low-interest rate movement in our country; However, it is found that the government bonds of our country used to set 8% as the normal interest rate. Although various bonds have been sorted out and reissued as unified bonds with 6% interest, it is still considered too high. Some say that excessively high interest rates are an obstacle to the development of industry and commerce, while excessively low interest rates also have the drawback of capital flight. The presence of foreign banks in China is numerous and powerful, and this aspect seems to be worrying. In fact, if it can be carefully considered and implemented, there is no need to worry. Moreover, with the rapid changes in the international situation today, the economic power of foreign merchants in China, which they used to rely on to look down on everything, will inevitably gradually shrink in the future. With the increasing prestige of the emerging China, its achievements in the future are limitless, which will make the international community look at it with new eyes. How can it be compared with the Amon of Wu under the old days? Moreover, the low-interest rate policy has become a pending issue that is the unanimous desire of the financial industry today. If the overall interest rate reduction is not actually implemented, not only will the financial industry itself be unable to survive, but the tens of thousands of economic recovery projects after the war will also inevitably be hindered. Therefore, in order to consolidate the foundation of the financial industry itself in the future and cope with the post-war financial situation, we should first find ways to adjust the structure of the central bank and enrich its content, so that it can change its historically unnatural phenomenon with the general financial market and maintain a close relationship. Then, special banks should set an example and first propose deposit rate reductions. Ordinary banks can follow suit. In the future, after the deposit interest rate is reduced, the burden on banks will be lighter, and the loan interest rate will also be reduced accordingly. Its contribution to the revival of industry and commerce after the war is not shallow. Other issues, such as how to increase the number of capital operations and reduce the degree of risk, and how to adjust the interest rate of government bonds, will have to be discussed in the future.

(The interest rate reduction of various commercial banks in Shanghai this time is of a different nature and cannot be discussed together with the contents of this section. I will write another article on it when I have time.)

Assisting the Social Economy and the Development of Financial Institutions for the Common People

The most important financial institutions for the common people in our country were originally: (1) pawnshops, (2) mutual aid societies, (3) postal savings, (4) simple life insurance, (5) savings banks, and (6) personal loan businesses; However, pawnshops have always been privately operated. Although there was once a proposal for public operation, it never materialized. It has always been criticized by the world along with personal loan businesses and regarded as a financial organization that exploits the common people; The mutual aid society system has a long history, but it is only limited to remote areas. Recently, cooperatives have been established to make up for its shortcomings, but due to its historical relations, it has not yet gained the deep understanding of the people; According to a survey in the 25th year of the Republic of China, the total amount of postal savings was only more than 54.42 million yuan. Compared with Japan, which has a population of only more than 90 million, and the total amount of postal savings reaches 400 million yen, it is indeed a huge disparity in the social wealth of the two countries, which is also sufficient to be regarded as the result of the recent habit of luxury among the people of our country, losing their virtue of thrift, which ultimately prevents social funds from being concentrated in large quantities; As for simple life insurance, it has not been established for a long time, and it cannot be compared with Japan, where every 30 out of 100 people are insured with simple life insurance; I think that in the future, in addition to working hard to promote the business of the above-mentioned various types of financial organizations for the common people, we may also adopt the Japanese unlimited liability company system to make up for our shortcomings, so that in the negative action of preventing the people from wasting money and borrowing debts, we still embody the utmost intention of promoting production groups.

Adjusting Personnel Issues to Adapt to the New Environment of the Future

Zeng Disheng once said: "Those who hold high positions should take knowing people and understanding things as their duty. It is not easy to learn to know people, but it is possible to gain knowledge through experience and hard work. The advancement of all undertakings depends on obtaining talents. Therefore, how to make talents correspond to the cause is something that Chinese financiers should deeply understand. The financial industry is related to various industries, and the knowledge required is naturally diverse. Moreover, modern society is becoming increasingly complex, and the knowledge required is also becoming increasingly complex. If the operation of the financial industry only pursues the abundance of capital and does not focus on the effectiveness of talent organization, the cause will inevitably decline. Therefore, how should personnel issues be adjusted and a sound personnel administration mechanism be established to meet the future environment after the war? It is easy to choose people for the cause, but it is difficult to choose the cause for people. The only accumulated habit of personnel management in China's financial institutions in the past lies in the failure to separate and distinguish the right and wrong interests of "people" and "things," resulting in the difficulty of obtaining a truly perfect system, and ultimately leaving behind the criticism of setting up things for people or delaying things because of people. The European and American banking systems are mainly represented by the British and American systems. The settings of shareholders, directors, and the general management office are roughly similar, but from the general manager down, the British system takes the centralized system, while the American system uses the decentralized system; The centralized system concentrates power in the general manager, and the rest are branches. However, in terms of the classification of business aspects and responsibilities, the general manager cannot take care of everything, so there are directors of each department to share the burden; The decentralized system is different from this. Each department of the bank has a manager, deputy manager, and assistant manager. Each department has a secretary, and each branch also has a secretary, who are all hired as the highest-level employees. Therefore, when dealing with a part of the business, they work together and help each other to achieve success, and take into account the overall axis of the bank, so that it can achieve the effect of collecting the strengths of all and being swift and quick. Those who argue that although the centralized system has various levels of important personnel, since the power is limited to the position, those below cannot act on their own initiative. The powers of the directors of each department also have their own scope, which is more abundant than the measures of the decentralized system and does not stick to one corner. Those who can achieve the effect of doing more with less effort and gathering strength should not be compared on the same day. The personnel system of China's financial institutions has always followed the regulations of the British and American systems, but has not been able to be consistent. In the future, it seems appropriate to adopt the strengths of all parties and eliminate their weaknesses, and to be inclusive and smelt them together, not sticking to one system and one regulation, but to pursue new methods while taking into account national conditions as the first priority.

The above discussion is only a brief outline and simple description, hoping to elicit valuable opinions, and thus be able to gain the rise of all parties and discuss with the wise people at home and abroad. (End)

### The Implementation of Our Country's Public Treasury Law and the Modernization of Financial Administration

— Wang Wennan

In today's wartime, the implementation of direct tax system, the reform of accounting system, the innovation of financial system, and the transformation of financial administration are merely the most obvious aspects of financial facilities, which shows the determination of the authorities to create with difficulty. In addition, the government has improved the financial revenue and expenditure management system to establish the foundation of a unified treasury. Since the promulgation of the Treasury Regulations by the National Government in the 16th year of the Republic of China and the establishment of the Central Bank in the 17th year, the bank has been given the special privilege of acting as the national treasury; all national treasury revenue and expenditure affairs were transferred from the Bank of China and Bank of Communications to the Central Bank, and gradually entered the path of unification. Unfortunately, at that time, financial revenue and expenditure were not on the right track. Various revenue and expenditure agencies still did not go through the treasury for the withdrawal and payment of funds, but paid themselves or allocated them to the competent authorities, and did not achieve the effect of centralized unification. As a result, the accounting authorities were very difficult to exert their supervisory effectiveness; the accumulated habits of corruption have not been thoroughly eradicated. The government realized the crux of the problem, and resolutely implemented the public treasury system; in order to make our country's finances on the right track, the Public Treasury Law was promulgated in June of the 27th year, and the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Public Treasury Law were promulgated in June of the 28th year, totaling 40 articles; On October 1st of the same year, the National Government clearly ordered the implementation to begin; Since then, financial power has been unified, and the receipt, disbursement, and custody of public funds have been concentrated, which is truly a dawn for China's finances. The characteristics of China's public treasury system are briefly described as follows, and I hope that the wise people at home and abroad will correct it:

(1) Concentrating National Capital: The public treasury system of our country is based on the principle of unification. All government funds are received by the public treasury; various agencies shall not arbitrarily establish treasuries and disperse custody, so as to avoid the evils of abuse and private interests. With funds concentrated in one place, the government should be more than sufficient to pay for all expenditures. Moreover, all expenses are planned and allocated by the Ministry of Finance, and there is no need to worry about the waste of national capital. According to the provisions of Article 3 of the Public Treasury Law, the Central Bank is the only agency for acting as the national treasury; however, since its branches are not widespread, it may entrust other banks or post offices to act as agents. It can be seen that the funds of all government offices should be deposited into the Central Bank; centralized receipt, disbursement, and custody of public funds; then the state financial resources, the government is easy to control.

(2) Adjusting Social Finance: The custody methods of public treasury systems in various countries are slightly different; there are distinctions between the national treasury system, the bank entrustment system, and the bank deposit system. The national treasury system is where the government establishes its own treasury to handle the receipt, disbursement, and custody of public funds. However, the establishment costs are huge, increasing the burden on the people; in modern times, various countries do not take it. The bank entrustment system entrusts the receipt, disbursement, and custody of public funds to banks as agents, and the banks only bear the responsibility of custody; they are not allowed to use the funds, which seems to have the drawback of stagnant funds. The bank deposit system is where the government's receipt and disbursement of funds are all handled by banks as agents; banks receive the government's public funds as government deposits; which are no different from ordinary people's deposits. Banks can use them as operating funds and use them freely to adjust the contraction of social finance and activate the national economy. According to the provisions of Article 8 of the Public Treasury Law, "The cash and matured bills and securities received by the bank as an agent of the government shall be in the form of funds"; then the deposit method of the public treasury in our country adopts the bank deposit system. The original intention of the legislation is very appropriate. The government can take interest on deposits, and the banks can rely on them for use. The two are mutually used, which is really beneficial to social finance.

(3) Refreshing Financial Administration: According to the current financial system in our country, there is a combined organization. Separately speaking: one is the budget system, where all revenue and expenditure of government agencies every year are based on the budget; and must not be arbitrarily expanded or contracted. The second is the accounting system, where the government sets up an accounting office to manage the recording of revenue and expenditure accounts and the preparation of budgets. The third is the auditing system, which is handled by the Audit Department, which specializes in the responsibility of checking and signing payment orders, that is, ex-ante audit. At the same time, it also verifies and cancels the expenditure calculation books sent by various agencies, that is, ex-post audit. The fourth is the treasury system, which unifies financial resources and concentrates the receipt, disbursement, and custody of public funds. Using these four systems in combination, the financial system must be strict and orderly. Unfortunately, in the past, because the public treasury system could not be established, the three parties of budget accounting and auditing were out of order; the accounting supervision was difficult to achieve; Now that the government has vigorously implemented the public treasury system, the accounting authorities can exert their supervision and verification to the greatest extent; then a clear and perfect financial administration mechanism can be expected to be completed. The reform of our country's finances is also just around the corner.

In short: the implementation of the Public Treasury Law directly puts finances on the right track, and indirectly increases the creditworthiness of our country's external finances. Therefore, the importance of the Public Treasury Law has been generally seen, but it is hoped that the whole country will work together to promote this excellent law, in order to thoroughly eliminate the accumulated habits of corruption, so that the reputation of the clean government will be spread overseas.

### The Twenty-Ninth Year's Remnants of the Woolen Industry

— Written by Fushi Sheng

First Quarter

Just as the lunar New Year approached, businesses were all seeking to close out the year. Each had profits, waiting for the reopening on the second half of the second month (i.e., the fifth day of the Lunar New Year) for trading to resume. However, Yuanbao (silver dollar) transactions mostly decreased. This was because last year's profits were ample, and each company already had a considerable amount of inventory. Additionally, the opening prices were on the rise, and the available patterns were limited, leading to a wait-and-see attitude. Nevertheless, due to the lack of new goods arriving at the port and the increasing costs, existing stocks were running low. Even the local Shanghai factory goods were frequently reporting price increases due to rising raw material costs, high overhead, and reduced production. Looking at the goods on hand, each was like a rare treasure. In early March, the wholesale trade in woolen goods was bustling, with many shipments to Tianjin and Beijing. The Western-style clothing makers and tailor shops on this street were eager to buy, and prices rose again, exceeding the opening prices. Buyers were accommodating to sellers and paid in cash, otherwise, prices would rise or someone else would snatch the goods up. This showed how brisk the business was. The demand for woolen Western suit fabrics from Dalian, Yokohama, Tokyo, Nagasaki, and Kobe increased frequently, but it was mostly limited to the aforementioned. It was said that the cost of living in those places was much higher than in Shanghai, and there was a shortage of everything, so they all purchased goods from Shanghai. Prices continued to rise. Italian goods sold especially well. Due to the high prices and shortages of imported goods, the sales of Shanghai-woven factory goods expanded. Both insiders and outsiders actively hoarded goods. Summer goods were especially selling well. After the middle of the month, various sectors tried their best to suppress prices, and the silver and money industries refused to provide mortgages, increasing the interest rates on loans. The delivery of woolen goods was delayed. Previous hoarders wanted to sell their stocks, resulting in standard market conditions with apparent firmness but hidden weakness. Special soft fabrics like Police and Wah Foo clothing materials, single-sided flannel, Hume No. 4, Harris Tweed, Xia Wei Ni, medium-thick serge, Han Li Meng, grass-yellow and grass-green riding breeches fabric, Walter Ni, rabbit wool, flannel, raincoat fabric, and silk gauze fabrics continued to sell well. People in the industry were optimistic about the future market, and there were many large orders for new goods in the second half of the year. However, Italian goods were all priced in US dollars and required a 30% down payment, so British goods were more frequently ordered.

Second Quarter

Except for Police, the rest all sold well in time. Those holding legal tender were again using manipulative tactics to collect and hoard goods, causing linen, rubber cloth, white canvas, white serge, white Zhigong, feather yarn, Fatty Pierre, Barré Ni, and Xia Ke Si Gen, which should have been sold in summer, to rise across the board. On June 2, the exchange rate suddenly plummeted, like a bolt from the blue. Businesses were shocked, and the prices of all goods rose sharply. Sample-based consignment shops issued notices raising prices by 20% or 30%. Wholesale transactions were temporarily suspended. All previous forward contracts that had not been settled were disputed and canceled. For two or three days, the rush to complete cash transactions at wholesale shops was unprecedented. Yi Chang Tai, Yi Feng, Hua Fu Tai, Yi Tai, and other shops made as much as seven or eight thousand yuan, and they all closed early. Buyers knew that the exchange rate had plummeted and that all goods would have to rise in price, so they all rushed to buy in advance. Although the US dollar and the shilling slightly recovered, the prices remained high. Each company in the industry regarded its inventory as treasure and arbitrarily raised prices. Italy joined the war, and the European war expanded, making woolen orders even more difficult. Most of the spring orders received telegrams from the factories, stating that in addition to price increases, 70% or 80% could not be woven. Many foreign companies canceled the orders they had placed. People's hearts were thus more firm. In early July, woolen prices continued to rise, and each type of goods remained scarce.

Third Quarter

Market conditions deteriorated, because many seaports were blockaded, transportation was limited, Japanese control was increasingly strict, and taxes and exchange rates were involved. Many out-of-town sales stopped. Also, because goods prices had been rising continuously, reaching the peak, and considering the unpredictable changes in the domestic and international environment, hoarding significantly decreased, resulting in standard market conditions with apparent firmness but hidden weakness. Also, due to the hot summer, mildew, and summer vacation, transactions decreased. In August, prices fell frequently, and the market atmosphere changed sharply. The main reasons were: (1) prices were high, and purchasing power was weakened; (2) overseas telegrams reported that wool prices had fallen by two yuan per pound; (3) domestic factory wool production was higher than before; (4) hoarders sold their stocks regardless of market prices; (5) due to the frequent price drops, buyers were increasingly afraid to buy, and the market weakened step by step. Hoarders generally suffered considerable losses. The heads of the special hoarding company jointly organized by the industry in Qipan Street looked worried, because they had hoarded a large number of woolens, and the mortgages they had taken out from the silver and money industries amounted to five or six million yuan, with monthly interest payments of seventy or eighty thousand yuan. In the second half of the month, the trend improved slightly, and the weather turned cooler, which revitalized business, and some goods started to rise again.

Fourth Quarter

The three months of this quarter were much better than the previous one. Overcoat wool was scarce, and qipao (cheongsam) wool was fashionable for a time. Seagull dragon horse sea wool overcoats for men and women became popular and sold widely. Wool edges with Western text and patterns were still fashionable. Domestic factory products were mostly woven. In terms of colors, green and blue were popular for both men's and women's clothing. For interlined overcoats, cashmere was more popular than riding breeches cloth. Thick and thin overcoat fabrics were generally popular with black and white interwoven patterns. Retail prices increased month by month. Since the factory price rose sharply by one or two yuan on December 8, people's hearts became more firm. The prices of various goods rose sharply. When foreign exchange tightened, holders hoarded even more. Due to the ever-changing domestic situation and various rumors, people inside and outside the industry who had floating capital were again absorbing and hoarding large amounts of woolens. Spring flannel and Police were especially sought after, and the city market atmosphere became more brisk and prices rose. The situation was special, and prices continued to rise. The main reason was: (1) The profits for the 29th year set a new record.

### Seafood: Ningbo Dried Mussels Stock Dries Up

Dried mussels have been actively selling recently. The supply of Ningbo goods has been intermittent, causing the stock to gradually dry up. Specifically, the seed mussels are in short supply. The current market price has risen to 460 yuan, three or four grade tribute 440 yuan, Yuan Tan 420 yuan, other foreign goods and general Tan goods 560 yuan, selected Zhuang 600 yuan.

### East Shrimp Tail Returns Strongly

The price of East shrimp tail in the previous market once dropped sharply. The lowest price of Yuanwei was only 3560 yuan. Recently, as all gangs made purchases, the market price rose step by step. The current market price must be 450 yuan. This good was taken out of the water in the autumn, although it is dry, the color and luster are not as good as before. Chao Bian is 500 yuan for the higher grade, 480 yuan for the second grade.

### Medicinal Materials: Dried Lily Bulbs Continue to Be Tight

Dried lily bulbs are out of stock due to lack of new arrivals, so the market situation is very tight. However, the medicine gangs do not buy at high prices, resulting in few transactions. But the shops insist on not loosening, and yesterday the market even called for a 5-yuan increase. It is expected that the market will rise again in the spring.

### Jian Qu (Distillers' Yeast) Expensive

Jian Qu (Distillers' Yeast) is facing source delays and is scarce on the market. Recently, it has been heard that local authorities have banned exports, making the market even tighter. If actual sales move, there is a risk of out-of-stock in the future. The current market price is generally 290 yuan, and high-quality goods are 320-330 yuan.

### America Has Not Banned Imports From Japan, Still Hopes Japan Will Automatically Awaken, The Export Ban Has Been Severely Affected, Roosevelt Decides to Fully Assist China and Britain

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" yesterday published a commentary by Woodhead, which stated: The US government and party leaders have quickly drafted the necessary legislation and submitted it to Congress to enable President Roosevelt to fulfill his commitment to fully assist democratic countries. After several meetings at the White House, leaders of both houses of Congress presented a comprehensive bill on the 11th of this month. The effect of this bill will be to give President Roosevelt the power to dispose of US industrial resources and supply them to countries such as Britain, China, and Greece, except for those necessary for its own national defense. The US President believes that defending these countries is defending the United States itself. The US government has made it clear that it will not hesitate to take basic steps to assist democratic countries and is determined to do so. The reason why it has not immediately taken action to prevent Japan from obtaining foreign exchange is that it still hopes that Japan will avoid danger, wake up early, and understand that challenging Anglo-Saxon countries will ultimately be ineffective. The export embargo imposed by the United States has caused serious anxiety and uneasiness in Japan. None of Japan's products are indispensable to the United States. If the United States imposes an import embargo on Japan in addition to the export embargo, Japan's important industries, including silk, canned goods, food, and porcelain, etc., will inevitably face complete bankruptcy.

### The French Concession Municipal Council's Budget for This Year, Revenue Exceeds 33 Million, Expenditures Equal Revenue

House tax: 15% on the rental value stipulated in the current regulations, and the principal tax is also 15%. Other donations and taxes: 10% to 200% on all consultation fees and miscellaneous taxes, each according to the regulations. (B) Ordinary Business License Tax: The Board of Directors resolved to cancel the special business license taxes for various industries as follows: bakeries, Western-style pastry shops, candy shops, fruit stores, employment agencies, film production companies, private wireless radio broadcasting stations, wireless radios, manufacturing and repair factories and sales stores, and listed them under ordinary business licenses. These tax rules will be implemented from January 1, 1941. (2) Under the expenditure item, the Board of Directors resolved that the estimated expenditure for 1941 should also be 33,183,358.55 yuan.

### As the Lunar New Year Approaches, Security is Tightened, Setting Off Firecrackers is Strictly Prohibited, Curfew on Lunar New Year's Eve Remains Normal

The police authorities of the two concessions in the city have recently increased the number of Chinese and Western detectives patrolling and guarding the area in order to maintain good security within the boundaries, as the Lunar New Year approaches and various industries are settling accounts and collecting money, fearing that unscrupulous people will take the opportunity to rob them. On the French Concession side, French and Vietnamese armed defense forces stationed in Shanghai will also carry machine guns and join police officers in guarding and guarding key transportation routes. Car patrol teams will also patrol in batches. The newly deployed wire mesh frames at the borders of the Public Concession will not be removed. In addition, the setting off of firecrackers for folk religious ceremonies and thank-you ceremonies is strictly prohibited. The curfew on the 26th of this month, which is the Lunar New Year's Eve, will be enforced as usual.

### Western Overseas Chinese Boy Scouts Commemorate Baden-Powell, This Afternoon the 19th, at the Jiangxi Road Church

Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the World Scout Movement, passed away in his residence in Kenya due to illness. After the bad news spread from London to Shanghai, the Western overseas Chinese Boy Scouts of various levels in the port have now scheduled a memorial service to be held at the Jiangxi Road Cathedral at 3 pm on the 19th of this month (Sunday) in order to commemorate the founder of the World Scout Movement. At that time, Boy Scouts of more than a dozen nationalities will gather to participate. At 2:30 pm, the Boy Scout Commander Mr. Gordon will lead them into the church square. All Boy Scouts must wear Boy Scout uniforms, but without sticks, and each with a black gauze band. In addition, Boy Scout trainers and Boy Scout groups will also attend the ceremony. It was rumored several months ago that Baden-Powell had passed away, and the local Boy Scouts planned to hold a memorial service, but later learned that it was a false rumor, so they stopped holding the service.

### The Shanghai West Blockade Line Is Gradually Being Removed, Only Great Western Road Has Not Been Opened

The western area of Shanghai, which was blockaded for half a month due to the assassination of a Japanese military policeman, has gradually returned to its original state since it was opened on the 15th of last month. Except for the barbed wire net at the intersection of Great Western Road and Jing'an Temple Road, the obstacles at Jing'an Temple Road, Yuyuan Road, Jessfield Road, and Caojiadu roads have been gradually removed. The British 7th Road bus has now resumed its original route, directly reaching Caojiadu. The 14th Road bus has still not been able to enter Great Western Road. After a part of the houses in Wangjia Lane were demolished, the Japanese have rushed to build "Sasaki Road." Residents of Yongyuanbang, Zhu Anhong, and others have also regained their freedom.

### All Industries Are Preparing to Collect Donations for Troop Transportation, Responding to the Spring Ceremony to Reward the Troops, Saving Annual Fees for Comfort Needs, Celebrating the Year of Victory and Promoting Enthusiastically

This year, all provinces, cities, and counties across the country are preparing to expand the promotion under the leadership of the General Association, celebrating the year of victory, soldiers serving on the frontiers, and preparing to conquer the plains. After all circles in Shanghai decided to respond to this campaign, it is reported that all industries have begun to promote it separately, so as to make collective and full donations in a rigorous and unified step. At the same time, citizens from all walks of life are also saving Spring Festival expenses from a personal perspective, or saving gifts, or transferring Spring Festival feast funds, all for the needs of comforting the soldiers. Therefore, this Spring Ceremony to Reward the Troops will be more enthusiastic and active. All Spring Ceremony to Reward the Troops donations will be collected by various national banks in accordance with the unified donation method of the Ministry of Finance and remitted to the Ministry of Finance for unified planning and distribution.

### Entrusting Brokers to Complete Foreign Rice Transactions at 10 Yuan Lower Than the Limit Price Fully Proves That the Sharp Rise in Rice Prices is Purely Due to Hoarders Speculating

The Shanghai Food Cooperation Association will start purchasing rice and grain on a specific day. Members of the association will receive special treatment and can go directly to the association on Edward Road to complete the registration procedures. It has now been agreed to order a triplicate form for food, which includes (1) the purchaser, (2) whether the purchaser is a member, (3) the food ordered, A. name, B. grade, C. quantity, (4) the deposit to be paid, (5) the address, including A. the detailed address for sending the rice (the road, lane number, building number, etc. must be filled out clearly), and B. the address for notifying the payment of the balance. All payments for ordered food can be sent directly to the association's collecting agencies, namely the Xinhua Bank and Tongrun Native Bank. It is hoped that all sectors of the city will actively participate in order to increase the people's food reserves.

Ningbo Fellow Association Sets Rice Price

The "Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association Food Regulation Association" specializes in providing group ordering of foreign rice for the benefit of Shanghai fellows. The first batch last year has been distributed to the ordering customers and has been completely completed. It is reported that the second batch of rice has arrived at the port and the procedures for leaving the warehouse are being handled within the day. The price of this rice has also been assessed by the association, that is, 99.3 yuan per bag. Those who entrust the purchase of more than ten bags will be delivered by a special envoy of the association to give preferential treatment. The association believes that the Shanghai people's food panic has not been completely resolved, but in order to implement the original intention, it has decided to continue to handle the third batch of orders. The association welcomes people from Ningbo to come and purchase.

Futures Prices Are Lower Than Limit Prices

Since rice brokers resumed entering the market on the 9th of this month, the situation has been normal. The Brokers Friendship Association has appointed Shao Qingfu and Cai Weixiang to be responsible for urging members. It is recorded that various foreign firms have entrusted brokers to complete more than 300,000 bags of futures transactions, and the prices are as follows: Jin Shen Foreign Firm sold 7,500 tons of January 15 shipment of small milled rice, priced at 82.7 yuan; 1,000 tons of No. 1 rice, priced at 90.045 yuan; 500 tons of mixed broken rice, priced at 69.5 yuan. He Yi Foreign Firm sold 1,000 tons of immediately loaded No. 1 rice, priced at 96 yuan; 1,000 tons of February shipment, priced at 90.02 yuan. Jinhua sold 1,000 tons of immediately loaded No. 1 rice, priced at 95.5 yuan; 500 tons of the next period small milled rice for January, priced at 83 yuan; 500 tons, priced at 81 yuan; 500 tons of No. 1 rice for February, priced at 92 yuan. Dafu Foreign Firm sold 2,000 tons of small milled rice shipped on January 9, priced at 83.5 yuan; 5,000 tons shipped on January 15, priced at 85 yuan. Ding Taihua sold 2,000 tons of No. 1 rice for February, priced at 93 yuan; 1,000 tons of No. 2 rice for January, priced at 89 yuan. Wan Yu sold 2,000 tons of No. 1 rice for February, priced at 92.6 yuan; 1,000 tons of No. 2 rice for January, priced at 89 yuan. Xinchangsheng sold 1,000 tons of No. 2 rice for January, priced at 88 yuan. Jianyuan sold 2,000 tons of No. 1 rice for February, priced at 92.75 yuan; 2,000 tons of small milled rice for January, priced at 80.05 yuan. There are also Japanese foreign firms selling 4,500 tons, priced at 82.3 yuan. The total above is more than 300,000 bags, and the price per stone of rice is about 10 yuan lower than the current limit price. It can be seen that the rice hoarders deliberately hoard and raise prices.

Explanation of Brokerage Fees

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Trade Association announced to the market yesterday: For the purpose of announcement, it has recently been claimed by the trade that how the various expenses required by brokers to handle the sale and purchase of rice should be calculated at the time of the sale and purchase transaction. Please forward this to the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee for a clear explanation. After the matter was forwarded to the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, the Committee replied: The evaluation of various foreign rice is the price sold by the owner. Brokerage fees are not included. However, market quotations should be based on the evaluation, and brokerage fees should not be included to prevent abuses. This is hereby announced to the market for your information.

### A Japanese Man Was Shot on Nanjing Road, Two Bullets Hit Vital Spots and the Injuries Were Serious, Temporary Strict Security and Inspection of Pedestrians

In front of the Zhonghe Commercial Savings Bank at No. 402, the corner of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road, at about 3:15 pm yesterday, a Japanese military officer wearing a uniform was walking side by side with a person wearing a plain-colored suit from west to east, when suddenly someone fired two shots at him, hitting his left breast and lower abdomen, and blood oozed out. He leaned on his companion and was still able to walk with the illness to the front of the Wangkai Photo Studio at No. 378, next to the Sichuan store, before he finally collapsed.

The Gunman Fled Without a Trace

At this time, Song Xueshun, a Chinese police officer No. 812 from Shandong, who was in charge of the traffic lights at the Huajinli intersection on Shanxi Road, suddenly heard two gunshots and immediately drew his gun and chased after the sound, but the pedestrians were crowded and he did not know where the gunman was. He immediately reported to the Central Police Station by phone. The district chief ordered Criminal Inspector Jiang Shangpei to lead Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene in a car for a strict search.

Temporary Martial Law, Serious Situation

On one side, temporary martial law was imposed on Shanxi Road to the east road intersection. Vehicles were allowed to pass in the middle of the road. All men and women pedestrians were only allowed to proceed from east to west, along the sidewalk on the south side of the road. Pedestrians traveling from west to east were completely prohibited from passing, and the situation was very serious.

The Injured Japanese Man Was Sent to the Hospital for Treatment

The injured Japanese military officer, Xiyan Xiong, is 37 years old. A ambulance was called and rushed to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for diagnosis and treatment. At 5:30 pm, he was still lying in the surgical room, waiting for the doctor to perform surgery. According to the doctor, it is not yet possible to predict whether his life is in danger. At the scene of the incident, although Chinese and Western detectives searched closely for bullet casings, it was reported that nothing was found. At about 5 pm, the area was lifted from martial law and traffic was restored. The police station is stepping up its efforts to catch the gunman.

### Portuguese Gambling Den, the Main Culprit Is at Large, Only Documentary Evidence Was Confiscated

The Public Concession Police Department has recently been strictly cracking down on gambling dens within the concession. At about 1:00 pm the day before yesterday, it suddenly received a tip-off that there was a secret gambling den opened by Portuguese people in the De Yi Building (Denis Apartments) on Jing'an Temple Road and Carter Road, gathering crowds to gamble (roulette). They immediately notified the Portuguese Consulate and obtained a search warrant, leaving many detectives to search.

According to shipping industry news, the Hong Kong authorities recently announced that this port is a smallpox infectious port. From now on, passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong must have a smallpox vaccination certificate for inspection upon landing in Hong Kong.

### The Tahu Tuo Wheel Is Postponed to Arrive in Shanghai

The President Tahu Tuo of the American Post Ship Company was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 19th of this month via Manila and Hong Kong, but it has now been postponed to the 21st due to some reason. It will be berthed at buoys 11 and 12, and will return to San Francisco and Los Angeles the next day via Japan and Honolulu. Joint transport to New York. According to the American Post Ship Company, the ship's cabins are almost completely presold, but there are still vacancies in first class, but this is not due to the evacuation of American overseas Chinese, but is only the normal state at the beginning of each year, because most American missionaries, etc., take vacations and return home at this time, and the general American overseas Chinese do not take the ship to evacuate.

### Postal Workers Demand Increased Subsidies, The Principle Has Been Accepted, the Head Office Telegram Has Been Sent With Detailed Measures, The Commercial Association Will Meet Again Today to Discuss

All postal workers and staff of the Shanghai Postal Administration and its subordinate branch offices, due to the impact of high rice prices and rising living costs, submitted a clause to Director Zha Peilin through the Shanghai Postal Workers Union in November of last year, including various living subsidies, to be issued together with the year-end bonus, and living costs to be issued according to the living cost index published by the Municipal Council, i.e., 21 yuan. It has been delayed until now for three months. On the 7th of this month, the Postal Workers Union made a final appeal to Director Zha, hoping for a satisfactory response before the 13th. A telegram has now been received from Director Guo of the Kunming General Administration.

The Head Office Replied With Principle Approval

The Shanghai Postal Association and the Shanghai Postal Workers Union jointly announced yesterday: Regarding the addition of living subsidies to the year-end bonus, the two associations sent a letter to Director Zha on the 7th of this month, with a deadline of before the 13th of this month for a satisfactory reply.

Because the cost of living is becoming more and more expensive, they have made a request to the employer to increase the living subsidy. The association of the museum has scheduled a joint meeting of the executive supervisors this morning to make a final appeal to the employer.

### 印花不准倒貼

Postage stamps and revenue stamps all bear the portraits of leaders and martyrs, intended to commemorate revolutionary sages and heroes.  Reversed or haphazard pasting is not only unsightly but also disrespectful.  Regarding the orientation of postage stamp placement, the government previously issued a circular order.  Revenue stamps, however, have continued with the old practice. It is recently heard that the National Government, based on a request from the Executive Yuan, has issued an order to financial institutions in all regions to forward to shops and businesses that, henceforth, revenue stamps must be pasted respectfully and correctly, without being inverted, to show reverence.

### People in Cities and Towns Along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line Live in Dire Straits; Japanese Control Everything, Prices Soar; Bandits Run Rampant, Opium Dens and Gambling Houses Are Everywhere

The *North China Daily News* reports: A dispatch from Peiping once stated that the Japanese have not implemented any effective administration in North China. The reporter will now briefly describe the situation along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway line to supplement this information.  First, regarding the Shanghai Railway Station, the state of congestion is indescribable.  This is a result of implementing an absurd measure that causes great discomfort, namely the thorough search of all passengers' luggage and persons.  The Japanese monopoly is constantly creating new tactics, hence this strict search.  Various foreign goods and many Chinese-made products are confiscated. Almost nothing is not considered contraband.  Salt and tobacco are subjected to the strictest searches.  From this, it can be seen that the congestion at Shanghai Station is a direct result of the restrictions on trade.

Daily Necessities Are All Expensive

Kerosene is also among the prohibited items.  It is heard that a sales agent dispatched by a certain American oil company can only transport oil into the interior if it is purchased through Japanese merchants.  The latest price of kerosene is thirty yuan per can.  Currently, the prices of essential goods in cities and towns along the line are: rice at sixty-nine yuan and fifty cents per dan, pork at eight liang per yuan, matches at fifty-five cents to eighty cents per packet, and salt at only one pound per yuan. If one can obtain a purchase certificate from the salt monopoly, one can get three pounds per yuan.

Armed Bandits Run Amok, Breaking the Law

The situation within ten li surrounding the towns is appalling. Armed bandits run rampant, breaking the law.  Within the cities, Japanese collaborators insult and oppress the people, and this has intensified in recent months.  Villages are still being looted and then burned to the ground.  Last month, two villages were destroyed, one with five hundred households, all the houses razed, and the other with two hundred households, seventy percent of the houses destroyed. This news is verified and reliable.

Controlling Everything, Encompassing All

There are now Japanese naval vessels patrolling in Lake Tai.  Japanese soldiers are stationed at all key points.  Ships must obtain permits to pass.  White rice sells for seventy yuan per dan in the northern part of Lake Tai and forty-six yuan in the south.  The reason for this may lie in the above.  Factories, power plants, ironworks, and match factories in the railway zone cities, as well as the fishing, silk, and slaughtering industries, are all controlled by the Japanese, and the profits mostly go into Japanese pockets.  Before the war, there were hardly any Japanese in the cities and towns along the railway line. Now, Japanese are everywhere, numbering in the hundreds. These fellows certainly do not live on air alone, and their private purses are gradually filling up.

Opium Dens and Gambling Houses Abound, Taxed Daily

The business of narcotics has increased rather than decreased.  Advertisements for the sale of opium are openly posted in many town and city streets, catching the eye everywhere.  Although the sale of white powder is not as public as that of opium, it can be purchased everywhere.  Another harmful development is the surge in gambling dens along the route from Shanghai to Jiangning. Gambling is rampant, and nightly profits of twenty thousand yuan are not uncommon. It is said that one gambling den owner pays taxes of up to two hundred yuan per day.  An upright Japanese official once expressed opposition to gambling to his superiors and attempted to shut down some gambling dens and even went to raid them.  When this was heard by his superiors, he was immediately transferred back to Japan and replaced by an accommodating person.

Reasons for High Rice Prices

The high prices of food in the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway area are not only due to the low value of the Chinese yuan.  Rumors are rife that food rice is being shipped abroad (to Japan), which is alarming and demands attention, and it must be acknowledged that a large amount of food rice is being shipped out of China as a fact.  Another factor is that patriotic Chinese troops do not allow livestock to be transported into Japanese-controlled areas.  Looking at all aspects, the situation in the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway area last year was actually worse than at the end of the previous year. Military management and administration have not been successful.  The so-called "governments" in various places have no power when it comes to good deeds, but have considerable power when it comes to evil deeds, which is deeply lamentable.

### Thirty-Six Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb the Suburbs of Zhuji City; Nine Japanese Warships Gather Off the Coast of Shipu; Two to Three Thousand Japanese Troops Are Currently in Dinghai

According to news from Zhejiang Province associations in Shanghai, thirty-six Japanese planes, starting at dawn on the tenth, formed formations and took turns bombing Zhuji all day.  Fires broke out in many places in the city and suburbs, causing severe damage.  Jinhua and Shaoxing, being close to Zhuji, also issued air raid alerts all day long, making the situation quite tense. Although Japanese planes passed through other coastal areas, they have not yet wreaked havoc.

Watching and Waiting for Eastern Zhejiang

Since the ninth, Japanese warships have been gathering on the Zhejiang sea.  More than ten ships have gathered off the coast of Shipu. According to news this morning, five Japanese warships are still anchored off the coast of Dongmen Island in Shipu.  Two Japanese warships each are also anchored off the coasts of Chuanshan and Ligang, cruising back and forth, acting anxiously.

Gathering in Dinghai

Furthermore, according to news from Dinghai, a considerable number of Japanese troops have been gathering in the area recently, totaling over two to three thousand.  There are also mixed units of Chinese puppet troops. Their uniforms and equipment are incomplete.  Their intentions are unclear.  However, Chinese troops stationed along the coast of Yinzhen have been closely monitoring them and keeping the Japanese warships under surveillance.

### The Number of Exposed Corpses Increases Daily

According to the report released by the Pushan Cemetery, from the sixth to the eleventh of this week, a total of 178 adult corpses and 369 child corpses were collected and buried in the public concession area.  Although it is the depth of winter, the weather in this port is still quite warm, but the number of exposed corpses on the roads and in the alleys is increasing daily, which truly reflects the soaring prices of everything in the isolated island and the difficulty of making a living.

### Chief Assistant of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Finance Department Resigns

Mr. Hergeson, Chief Assistant of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Finance Department, who has served in the bureau for many years, has submitted his resignation due to personal reasons, which has been approved and he has formally left the bureau.

### Dismissed Driver Arrested

The Shanghai Brewery on Yichang Road recently discovered that more than a hundred empty barrels, each worth over a hundred yuan, had been stolen, with an estimated loss of over ten thousand yuan. They secretly reported this to the Jintuo Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Feng Baishun to investigate.  It was found that the truck driver delivering the goods, Hu Kairen from Hubei, 25 years old, had been suspended for misconduct last Christmas.  However, his uniform had not yet been handed over to the factory.  Therefore, he was familiar with all the customers who had previously received deliveries.  He went door to door to trick them into giving him the empty barrels without any flaws.  Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, it was discovered that Hu was hiding on a painted pleasure boat on West Suzhou Road, and he was apprehended at that address and sent to the court for investigation.

### Mail Transported to Free China via the Yunnan-Burma Road; New Postal Agreement Established Between China and Britain; Central Station for Mail Exchange Established in Wanting

According to sources from the postal authorities, after the Japanese army occupied and controlled the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, overseas mail from China was no longer transshipped via Vietnam. Now, after thorough consultation between the Chinese and British authorities, a new postal agreement has been established. Mail that previously had to be sent via Vietnam will now be transported via the Yunnan-Burma Road. All mail sent from coastal areas of China and from foreign countries to provinces in Free China will be transported via the Yunnan-Burma Road. Mail sent from provinces and regions in Free China to coastal areas such as Hong Kong and Shanghai and to various foreign countries will also be transported by trucks on the Yunnan-Burma Road. A central station for Chinese and British mail exchange will be established in Wanting, near Lashio. Therefore, mail transshipped via Vietnam can be avoided in the future. The accumulated mail since the Japanese army occupied the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway can gradually be cleared, and the time will be faster than at present. As for airmail, Hong Kong will remain the central transit station.

### Glove Factory Lost Money on Orders; Attempted Arson; Planned to Obtain Insurance Money to Cover Losses; Arson Attempt Thwarted, Case Concluded and Awaiting Sentence

Hu Meifu from Ningbo has been running the Shixin Leather Goods Glove Factory at 36 Lane 6, Lloyd Road for years. He originally had fire insurance of 25,000 yuan with the Xinhua Insurance Company. Recently, Hu received an order for 500 dozen gloves from the Shanghai office of the Japanese 52nd Trading Company, valued at 26,000 yuan. However, due to the recent soaring prices of leather, Hu calculated that he would lose 10,000 yuan, so he was unable to deliver the remaining 100 dozen gloves, and the customer was urging him to do so. In order to overcome this difficulty, Hu racked his brains and, after much thought, increased his fire insurance with Xinhua by 15,000 yuan, bringing the total to 40,000 yuan. Then, on the tenth, he bought a gallon of gasoline and at 4:00 AM the next morning, he poured it on piles of cotton and firewood to start a fire. After the fire started, Hu fled to Room 519 of the Central Hotel, planning to claim compensation from the insurance company after the fire. Unexpectedly, the fire was discovered by the neighboring Daqingyong Hotel, and the entire staff extinguished it with water, preventing it from spreading. After the incident, Chinese Detective Wang Shanqing of the Old Zhabei Police Station investigated and found the arson fact. Hu was arrested, and it was also found that his wife, Hu Xu, had jointly conspired. She was also arrested and sent to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division. The police lawyer, Shu Zhishan, charged him with arson under Article 173 of the Criminal Code. The two defendants hired lawyer Qian Zheng to defend them. After hearing the facts and clarifying the details, the judge ordered them to be detained and await sentencing.

### Abduction of Kang Shoufan Case; Bandits Captured

Kang Shoufan, director of the Guohua Cotton Weaving Factory on East Youheng Road in Hongkou, was kidnapped by bandits at around 10:00 AM on December 13th of last year when he was driving his car to the factory gate. He disappeared without a trace and was hidden for nearly twenty days. It is now learned that Kang escaped and returned home on the 4th of this month. According to his statement to the police, the two bandits guarding the hostage got drunk and he escaped. At around 2:00 PM yesterday, the Putuo Road Police Station received a tip that the bandits in this case were skating at the Wing On Company Skating Rink. Several detectives were dispatched quietly to arrest them and bring them back to the police station for investigation.

### Young People Associate with Bandits, All Rounded Up; Dressed in Suits, Wearing Diamond Rings, Exceptionally Stylish, All Stolen Goods

Romantic youths Xue Genqing from Ningbo, Zhang Fulin, Zhou Yongfu, Weng Zhutang, Mao Yuqing, Chen Zhongxiang, Chen Xianliang, Zheng Liangzhe from Guangdong, and others are addicted to prostitution and gambling, spending money like water. Recently, they have been associating with bandits. When their money ran out, they resorted to robbery. They had multiple fake pistols. This was discovered by Chinese Detectives Sun Chao Chen Hu Kuang-jung of the Shanghai Municipal Police. These fellows often frequented the Wing On Skating Rink, the Jue Lu Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, and the Garden Hotel at 219 Zhejiang Road, engaging in entertainment and games. At around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, Western detectives, assisted by the above detectives, arrested eight people, including Xue Genqing, at the above locations. They confessed that four fake pistols were hidden in Room 2 of the Xin Travel Hotel at 16 Lane 502, Guangdong Road. Chinese and Western detectives rushed to the address and searched the room, finding the pistols in a wardrobe. The dancer, Tan Hongmei from Yangzhou, was also taken into the police station and detained separately. The day before yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, explained the case, stating that the gold ring and diamond ring worn by the defendant Zheng Liangzhe were robbed from somewhere, and the victim had not yet been identified. He requested a postponement of the investigation. Subsequently, Huang Fusen, the detective in charge of the case, explained the process of solving the case. The defendants were all well-dressed, wearing leather shoes and Western suits, and were exceptionally stylish. Under interrogation, their statements were evasive. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to be detained separately for further verification at a later date.

### Group of Suicides

Qingnian Ding Songyuan, 23 years old, a resident of 27 Lane 168, Chengdu Road, was a student at a certain middle school. Because he failed this winter vacation examination, Ding was deeply ashamed and unhappy. Unexpectedly, he had the idea of committing suicide. Suddenly, at 10:50 AM yesterday morning, he drank poison at home. His family discovered him and called a car to take him to Shilong Hospital for treatment.

Yesterday morning at 3:40 AM, a traveler named Wu Jinnian (22 years old) in Room 39 of the Pacific Hotel at 430 Guangxi Road suddenly took poison in his room and committed suicide. The tea boy discovered him groaning in the room and realized that he had taken poison. He immediately called for an ambulance and sent him to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the reason was economic hardship.

Chen Defu, a Shanghai native, 26 years old, residing on the front floor of 85 Wenli, Da Tong Road East, lost his job due to the war and was trapped in poverty. His wife, Zhang (of the same age as Chen), is currently working as a helper at 23 Henan Road, while Chen ekes out a living as a peddler. Recently, due to business losses, coupled with the approaching end of the lunar year, he suffered double economic pressure and was unable to maintain his livelihood. He had a moment of despair and went alone to Room 13 of the Yongfu Hotel at 341 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession at 11:00 PM on the ninth and swallowed poison to commit suicide. He was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but died on the afternoon of the eleventh.

### Unable to Endure the Night Cold, Burning a Coal Stove; Wife and Three Children Poisoned to Death; Husband's Life Also in Great Danger

Zheng Bingwen from Guangdong, 29 years old, lived in the second-floor pavilion room at 37 Yongji Lane, Weihaiwei Road. The night before last, Zheng was burning a coal stove indoors for warmth due to the severe cold. He forgot to extinguish it before going to bed, resulting in Zheng, his wife Li (27 years old), his eldest son Fuji (5 years old), and his daughter Fuzhen (3 years old), all being poisoned by coal gas. They fell into unconsciousness. It was not until around 8:00 AM yesterday morning that a co-resident with Zheng, because he had not left his room, became suspicious and opened the door. He discovered the poisoning and quickly reported it to the police and called for an ambulance to take them to Baolong Hospital. However, Zheng's wife, Li, and their children were poisoned too severely and died one after another. Zheng himself is also in critical condition. At this time of deep winter, residents who burn coal stoves for warmth are earnestly urged to endure the night cold and be sure to extinguish them before going to bed to avoid death from coal gas poisoning.

### Manager of Dingda Cloth Store Accused of Embezzling a Huge Sum; Court Summoned Him But He Did Not Appear; Further Summons Ordered

Dingda Gauze Store in Wuxi has a towel shop in Yongji Lane, Jiangxi Road, and appointed Zhu Shangyi as manager. The gauze store had the most dealings with the Shanghai Dafeng Gauze Store on the second floor of the Gauze Exchange on Avenue Edward VII. Whether buying or selling spot or futures, Zhu handled everything with Dafeng Gauze Store. According to commercial practice, it was not necessary to pay cash; everything depended on mutual credit. Zhu took the opportunity to embezzle more than 70,000 yuan in national currency from February of the 28th year of the Republic of China to June 21st of the 29th year. This was recently discovered by shareholders such as Yuan Shaokun of Dingda Gauze Store, who dismissed Zhu from his position and ordered him to hand over the account books. However, Zhu continued to procrastinate. Yuan Shaokun recently commissioned lawyer Lin Yingqing to file a complaint in the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing Zhu of breach of trust and embezzlement. The case was recently summoned by Judge Huang at the Third Criminal Division. The plaintiff, Yuan Shaokun, along with his lawyer, Lin Yingqing, appeared in court to testify.

### Teachers at Xingzhong Primary and Secondary School Demand Pay Raise

The Xingzhong Primary and Secondary School located at Qunxian Villa on Xuehuali Road, Jin Shenfu Road, used the excuse of increasing salaries for teachers and staff to raise tuition fees for students by two yuan per person last semester. This semester, they used the same reason to increase tuition fees for students of all grades by 30 to 40 percent. However, neither decision has resulted in any increase in salaries for teachers and staff. All teachers and staff, because everything is expensive and they cannot maintain their livelihoods, have unanimously requested the school authorities to improve their treatment: (1) Request to be paid double salaries for this month of this semester, (2) Salary increase of 50 percent starting next semester, (3) Salaries for the next semester should be calculated based on six months, (4) Teachers cannot be dismissed without cause, (5) Teachers cannot be arbitrarily insulted, (6) Non-resident teachers should be given a rice allowance.

### Good Fortune in Soccer: Dong Wah Beats Clarks Again Yesterday, Two to Zero, One Goal in Each Half, The Situation Was Tense, but Not Much Excitement

In the Western Union Football League Group A match, Dong Wah faced Clarks again at the Recreation Ground yesterday morning at 10:30 AM. Dong Wah had a sweeping victory of seven to two in the first round. Yesterday, due to injuries to key players, five reserve players were called up to play. Clarks' captain Simmons was unable to attend, and Li took his place as center-back. Although the match was slightly less exciting, the situation was very tense. Dong Wah's strength was certainly lacking, and Clarks was admittedly not as good. As a result, Dong Wah won two to zero, with one goal in the first half. Because the Western Police team lost again to St. Francis the day before, Dong Wah's hopes for the Group A championship have become stronger again. Yesterday, the Bian team missed many opportunities, and the number of times Clarks could have scored but didn't was countless. This shows that Dong Wah had good fortune in soccer.

The Clarks team kicked off

and was immediately blocked. Dong Wah's offense was strong in the first ten minutes. Jia Youliang, Chen Yutian, and Li Yichen all had opportunities to shoot, but none succeeded. Later, Jia Youliang got the ball and crossed it in. Li Yichen dribbled forward a few steps, raised his foot and shot, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. Li and Dai coordinated their attack. Dai dribbled to the front, but was kicked out by Mink. Kapustin passed to England, but he was too slow to catch up and was lightly intercepted by Qin Bicao. Dong Wah's crisis was averted, and the entire army began to attack again. Dai, as the center forward, led the three armies straight into the enemy territory. Blott, eager to save the ball, dived but failed, and the center forward rushed too hastily and missed the shot. Three minutes later, Dong Wah's Dai Linjing received support from the rear, passed it to the right winger Jia Youliang. Jia passed the ball and shot, but it was touched into a corner by Greenberg. Dong Wah repeatedly attacked without success, and the Clarks team was also unable to break through Dong Wah's defense. The situation was extremely dull. Until the 42nd minute, Gao Baozheng suddenly advanced on the right, passed the ball in, Dai Linjing waited for the ball and with a powerful kick, shot straight into the net, breaking the deadlock and earning a lot of applause. Dong Wah's offense was also boosted by this. Chen Yutian and Li Yichen made two consecutive shots, but both missed the target. At the end of the first half, Dong Wah led one to zero.

After the break

Clarks switched Kapustin and Wiley to increase their offense. Soon, Kapustin dribbled in, Li Ning rushed out, luckily Kapustin's shot hit the post and bounced out, Zhuang Youren added another kick to turn the danger into safety. Dong Wah having avoided being broken, Dai Linjing again shot from 30 yards out, hitting the post and bouncing out. Chen Yutian did not catch up in time, and the good opportunity was lost. Since then, Dong Wah's offense has been frequent, but unfortunately, the Clarks defense was tight, and they were unable to succeed. Clarks' center forward England had two excellent opportunities to score within three yards of Dong Wah's goal, but both were saved by Qin Bicao, whose performance was excellent and rare. After 35 minutes, Gao Baozheng got the ball and dribbled forward, secretly passed it to Li Yichen, Li swept it into the net, making it two to zero. The statutory time ended, and Dong Wah won again by two to zero against Clarks.

### Advice to Coal Merchants

— Sun Choucheng

The coal market has been very stable recently. Although it is winter and the demand for coal is high, the daily supply and sales are sufficient to maintain balance. Therefore, speculative coal merchants have no way to be active. After the market opened a few days ago, speculative coal merchants deliberately spread unfounded rumors in an attempt to raise prices and earn extra profits, which eventually caused the long-dormant coal market to become tight. As a result, in addition to the increase in the price of raw white coal, the price of coal briquettes also rose by eight yuan per ton (from 144 yuan factory price to 152 yuan, and 7 yuan 8 jiao per load in retail). Therefore, the association of cooked water operators has also sent representatives to the Public Concession Board and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to call for assistance and demand the cancellation of the coal price increase. Coal is one of the seven necessities of life (firewood is one of the seven necessities, but since many people in Shanghai burn coal stoves, they use coal instead of firewood). It is indispensable for families and should not only consider personal interests while disregarding the lives of others. My friend Yuan Qumei has written eight quatrains to advise the coal merchants, hoping that their conscience will not be as black as coal briquettes, and that they will not sell expensive coal mixed with mud and sand. Although the language is popular, the intention is profound. I am sending it to this publication in the hope of improvement. (1) Drinking blood and eating raw meat, succeeding Suiren, cooking and ripening food rely on firewood. Since Watt invented steam, coal combustion has been pure firepower. (2) The mining of national coal is still scarce, but land and water transportation is already smooth. It is used as a substitute for firewood for daily use, leaving the mountain woodcutters idle. (3) Don't say that people take food as their heaven, it is useless to have rice without coal. It is futile to starve to death at the border, and every thatched cottage has no smoke. (4) How can you order prices to be the same when there is full of grain and must be some coal? The wholesale and the retail price should be appropriate, and it is right to share wealth among others. (5) In the past, all surplus was purchased, and it is true that prices will go high and low. Try to pluck a hair to benefit the world. How is the flat price of coal briquettes? (6) Don't compare coal color to your conscience. You should report good news even if you seek profits. Since ancient times, hiding things often invites robbers. Gentlemen, broaden your minds. (7) It turns into slag as soon as it catches fire. A large amount of mud and sand are mixed in. It is difficult to swallow half-cooked and half-raw. It's just that the rice grains have not blossomed. (8) Production should prevent fakes from confusing the real ones. Cunning merchants are skilled in their own ways. It is good to rely on good faith to maintain justice, not to flatter and learn to smile.

### The Story of Furs

— Chen Nianyun

Time flies, and winter has already arrived. Fur garments are everywhere on the streets of the foreign concessions. I will now tell the story of furs to fill the pages of this publication.

The Strategies of the Warring States, Qin Strategies, records: "Su Qin presented his proposals to the King of Qin ten times, but they were not adopted. His black sable fur coat was worn out, and his hundred catties of gold were exhausted. His resources were depleted, so he left Qin and returned." Su Qin was the one who united the six states against Qin. The King of Qin did not use Su Qin's plan, so his gold was used up and his sable fur coat was damaged. The politician was pitiful, but later Su Qin persuaded Yan and Zhao to unite the six states and form an alliance to resist Qin. Su Qin was the leader of the alliance and was unstoppable.

The Analects, Chapter on the Village Party, records: "A black gown with lambskin fur, a white gown with deer fur, and a yellow gown with fox fur. The casual fur coat was long, and the right sleeve was short." Black is black, white is white, so a white gown is matched with deer fur; fox is yellow, so a yellow gown is matched with fox fur. The clothes should be matched with the fur to make them look good. Confucius was a sage and teacher who liked to wear fur. His design of fur was artistic. In order to keep warm, the casual fur coat should be long, and in order to make it easier to work, the right sleeve should be short. Confucius not only advocated wearing fur, but also made artistic designs. Although there are only a few words, they are all-encompassing.

"Dream of the Red Chamber" is a love story, and there are many amorous stories in it. Qingwen, who was ill, mended a peacock feather fur coat at night, which was also one of them. Because Baoyu's peacock gold thread fur coat, which was given by Grandma Jia, was accidentally burned, it had to be worn the next day for a birthday celebration. So he asked a tailor to mend it, but no one had the skill. Baoyu was very anxious. Qingwen, who was ill, learned about this and struggled to get up, mending it overnight while sick. Such deep affection and love made the Yihong Gongzi (Baoyu) truly blessed.

### The Significance of Dusting Off the New Year

— Zhang Mengzhao

Before the end of the lunar year, housewives in middle and lower-class families are busy dusting off the New Year. I remember when I was a child, I saw my mother and sister dusting off the New Year. They wore blue headscarves (a shield to avoid dust), short clothes and skirts, rolled up their sleeves and tied straw to long bamboo poles to make dust brooms. They got up early in the morning to clean the courtyard and the rooms, leaving no dust or cobwebs under the eaves or in the corners of the walls. After the big cleaning, everything looked new. The old dirt was gone, and the new colors arrived. Their spirit of diligence and cleanliness is truly admirable! To see whether a housewife is good or bad, you only need to see whether the furniture, the plants, and even a piece of cloth in their home are cleaned clearly. Otherwise, by the end of the year, if there are still cobwebs and dust, the decadence of this family can be imagined.

There are many maids and servants in the mansions of rich families on the isolated island, and they clean every day, but they cannot be said to be prosperous families. Why? Because their pleasure-seeking housewives are born lazy and only know how to play mahjong every day and dance every night. They leave everything to the servants, what is so valuable about that? On the other hand, housewives in poor and middle-class families do everything themselves and do not rely on servants. They clean their pigeonhole homes spotlessly. This is truly what is meant by: "A room does not need to be large to be elegant, and flowers do not need to be many to be fragrant." I hope that all the virtuous housewives on the isolated island will rise up, do it themselves, and do this cleaning movement of dusting off the New Year.

### Auxiliary Products for Walking

— Zheng Mei

The use of a cane for support is found in the Book of Rites, which says: "Carrying one's hands behind one's back and dragging a cane." Therefore, painters who paint the Four Sages of Mount Shang must depict them with canes and wandering around. This is because they are old and weak and cannot do without it. This is different from Westerners who carry walking sticks merely as a formality. The late Mr. Ding Zhonghu examined this in detail in his article on the health of the elderly. This old man was well-versed and worthy of admiration.

A cane is called "Fulao" (supporting the old), which can not only provide support for walking, but also allow the hands and feet to take care of each other and prevent rushing. Its length must be one foot taller than the head, so that when entering and exiting doors, there will be obstacles, which can be used to remind oneself to be careful. The Wang Zhi (Royal Regulations) says: "At fifty, one uses a cane at home; at sixty, one uses a cane in the village; at seventy, one uses a cane in the country; at eighty, one uses a cane in the court." It is appropriate to use it when etiquette requires it. Do not pretend to be young and strong, and abandon it. As for the cane made of bamboo, it is chosen for its lightness and ease of lifting. Therefore, the supporting cane must be called "Fuyi," also called "Fuqiong." According to the records, "Yizhu" is produced in Yizhou, Sichuan, and its roots have three branches, which is unusual. The "Qiong" cane, which is as high as a crane's knee, is produced in Xuzhou, Sichuan, and is called "Qiong." Bamboo has many kinds, but only the original solid material is suitable for use. Rattan can also be used as a cane, especially those produced in Guangdong and Guangxi. The Yi Qi Shi in the Book of Rites mentions that the king gave tooth canes to the elderly. The Book of the Later Han Dynasty says that people who are seventy years old are given canes, with a dove bird at the end, because the dove is not choked. One wants the elderly to eat and drink without choking, so one wishes them no choking. I once saw an old copper dove, with mottled vermilion, which was indeed a cane head from the Han Dynasty, because ancient people made it of copper. Nowadays, short canes are mostly used, which are not canes. Their length is the same as the waist, with a horizontal bar of four or five inches on top for easy gripping, called "guai" (crutch). It is best to use plum branches, which are old and tough, with natural forks that can be gripped. Young and old alike carry them when traveling in the mountains or walking in muddy roads, and they can borrow its strength. As for the elderly, when they stroll in the wilderness or stand idly in the courtyard, they occasionally carry it. However, people always prefer convenience and hate the roundabout way. Therefore, people prefer to use crutches rather than canes. The original intention of making canes may gradually be forgotten. A spare item can be hung under the cane head, such as Ruan Xiu hanging money on his cane, which is called "money on the cane head." The style is to nail a copper ring under the cane head, about five or six inches apart, and then tie the item to the ring. Some people use a small bottle to insert seasonal flowers as a cane head bottle. Bao Puzi says: "Hang a gourd on the cane to store elixirs."

In the past, there was a Zen monk named Yiquan who presided over the Baiyao Nunnery. His Zen friend wrote a verse for his cane: "The old support the cane, the cane supports the old, if one loosens one's grip, one often falls." Yiquan greatly praised it, and also imitated it to write a verse: "The monk is drunk with wine, the wine is drunk with the monk, one night, the sun rises high." Those who heard it laughed at him.

In the past, the Ke Garden in Suzhou held a Suzhou cultural relics exhibition, which included a dragon-headed cane, which belonged to Qian Muzhai. It was about five feet long and exquisitely carved. Looking at it, one could not help but feel nostalgic.

I once saw a neighbor's sunny and rainy cane, which could be opened and closed. When closed, it was no different from an ordinary cane, but when opened, it became an umbrella, which was also very ingenious.

### Recent Trends in Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation in the New Year Market (Part 2)

— Tian Shi

To prepare it, take a handful of shredded dried apples, simmer for three minutes, let it sit briefly, and then add sugar to the juice and drink. Apple tea contains "malic acid," which aids digestion, facilitates excretion, and stimulates the appetite and kidneys. It uses chemical action to capture "uric acid" in the blood, so that this uric acid waste can be combined with fruit acid, preventing it from harming the body and easily excreting it. On the other hand, fruit tea also contains "tannin," which is produced by soaking tea for a long time, and has the special function of relieving diarrhea. In short, it can cleanse the blood and prevent gout. While it promotes excretion, it does not cause diarrhea. In addition, this fruit tea can prevent insomnia.

Third, Housing: The most amazing new chemical product in this autumn's market is "Plexiglas" (which can also be translated as flexible glass). Its appearance is similar to glass. However, its chemical properties are unlike ordinary glass, whose raw material is silicate. Its wide range of uses can also be used as a substitute for wood or iron. The raw materials for Plexiglas are wood, coal, and limestone. First, they become an organic, acrylic-like synthetic resin. Then, through the chemical process of "polymerization," they are transformed into a transparent material that can be shaped by high heat (thermoplastic). Although this material is as thick as 20 centimeters, it is still very transparent. Its transparency is stronger than ordinary glass. Unfortunately, it weighs one-third more than ordinary glass. It is very tough and elastic.

### A Week's Home Cooking Menu

— Ms. Ying

I am very ashamed! I have been doing this week's menu for this publication for a long time. Originally, the dishes I made were mainly economical, so I specifically called it the economical menu. However, in the past six months, rice has become like pearls, firewood like cassia, and the prices of all things have soared. Whether meat or vegetables, they have all risen, so which item can be called economical? Every time I make this menu, when I write the word "economical," I feel that it is out of date, so from this issue, I changed the economical menu to the home cooking menu. In the past, pork and beef were the cheapest meats, and I always used them alternately every day on this menu, and I didn't dare to bring out the aristocratic chicken and duck. Now pork and beef cost more than two yuan per pound, which is about the same price as chicken and duck, so on Saturdays and Sundays, when everyone thinks it is a day for leisure and entertainment, I also let them come out to show their faces.

Monday: Cabbage Heart Braised Meatballs, Scallion Grilled Small Crucian Carp, Spinach Braised Tofu, Braised Radish Slices

Tuesday: Tomato Beef Slices, Sweet and Sour Yellow Croaker, Cabbage and Vermicelli, Shrimp Roe Stir-fried Gluten

Wednesday: Mustard Greens Stir-fried Shredded Pork, Pea Sprouts Stir-fried Small Shrimp, Plain Stir-fried Tatsoi, Plain Tofu Soup

Thursday: Mutton Braised Bean Noodles, Steamed ______ Fish Soup, Fried Dough Sticks and Soybean Sprouts, Raw Mixed Water Celery

Friday: Shredded Pork Braised Tofu, Dried Shrimp Egg Drop Soup, Plain Stir-fried Cabbage, Preserved Vegetable Mung Bean Sprouts

Saturday: Algae Duck Gizzard Soup, Drunken ______ Fish Slices, Braised Vegetarian Ten Scenes, Scallion Oil Radish Shreds

### A Plea on Behalf of Elementary School Teachers

— Editor

After the publication of "Increasing Tuition Fees and Increasing Salaries" in the 10th issue, within two days, we received a total of thirty-six letters from teachers appealing for help. The consistent request was the same as that mentioned in the article "Increasing Tuition Fees and Increasing Salaries": that the school's finances be made public and that the increased tuition fees be distributed to all teachers. Among them, two letters were even more poignant: one was "Appeal from Teachers of ×× Elementary School to All Sectors," and the other was "The Life of a School Teacher Versus a Rickshaw Puller" (both published later). The former had been forced to retain students' major exam scores as a means of resolving the problem; the latter even lamented that they were not as good as prostitutes and rickshaw pullers.

The lives of elementary school teachers are indeed too difficult. This publication has published many cries from the depths of their hearts in the past. However, the Chongqing orders have not been able to take effect as expected. The repeated increase in tuition fees has only filled the pockets of individuals. As a result, "when they are squeezed too hard, a huge force of resistance will erupt," and there has been a trend of strikes and slow-downs. This is a most unfortunate thing!

"Today's youth are the pillars of the future country. The responsibility of educating and guiding youth is extremely important." All the elementary school teachers in Shanghai work tirelessly because of this sense of responsibility. Therefore, in addition to expressing our sympathy, we hope (and want to succeed) that those with a little conscience will automatically resolve this matter. Otherwise, the results of "resistance" and "self-pity" will have terrible consequences – consequences that will cause pain to those close to them and bring joy to their enemies.

The moment of survival of "isolated island" education is just a moment away. Please, principals, have pity on the youth of the next generation!

### Appeal to All Sectors from Xing× Elementary School Teachers

We respectfully and with utmost sincerity appeal loudly to all sectors. Our current action is due to our inability to endure the exploitation by the school.

In this day and age, everything is expensive. The school increased tuition fees by 30-40% for students in order to raise teachers' salaries. Of course, this is justifiable. However, in this commercially-driven school, the school administration used the salary increase as a pretense to increase its own private wealth. In reality, we teachers are still tightening our belts and eating the northwest wind. Although we received a salary increase last year, we each only received an increase of two yuan. What can this supplement for us?

Furthermore, the school usually treats teachers as shop owners treat their employees, which we have tolerated. However, when we are squeezed too hard, we will inevitably unleash a huge force of resistance.

This time, we have withheld the results of the final exams. Of course, we extend our sincerest apologies to all parents of the school. Once the school accepts our conditions, we will immediately proceed with the settlement procedures.

Our proposed conditions are: (1) We demand double the salary for this month of this semester (calculated as one and a half months, double salary should be calculated as three months). (2) Increase the salary for the next semester by 50%. (3) Calculate the salary from the next semester based on six months. (4) Teachers should not be dismissed without just cause. (5) Teachers should not be insulted at will. (6) Teachers who do not live in the school should be given a rice subsidy (based on a percentage of the rice price).

We long for the sympathy and assistance of all sectors!

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Just as Yuqin left the master's room, he saw Yuhua waiting for him in the side entrance from a distance. He was scratching his short hair incessantly, revealing an extremely anxious expression.

"What did the master say to you?"

Yuqin followed him towards the outer wing, explaining the master's words to him in detail as they walked.

"Humph!" Yuhua's expression changed immediately, and he let out a very gloomy snort from his nose.

Yuqin immediately regretted it. He knew that this elder brother of his had the most volatile personality among the students, like a volcano about to erupt all year round. Once, when the martial arts teacher beat Yu Kun with a rifle, he had the courage to snatch it away. Also, once in the backstage, just as Yuqin, dressed as Liu Yingchun, was about to go on stage, a student playing a painted-face role was bothering him too much. Yuhua, playing Xue Rengui, was about to go on stage as the gongs and drums were starting up. As soon as he heard Yuqin's scolding, he retreated from the entrance to the stage and slapped the student playing the painted-face role twice, filling his mouth with blood. Later, back in the class, the master punished him to kneel in the courtyard. In a fit of anger, he knelt there all night, refusing to get up no matter who called him...

This really worried Yuqin. He thought that he himself might be able to endure it, but it was hard to say about Yuhua. When that regimental commander came in the afternoon, as long as he said one more word, Yuhua might immediately turn against him. However, this was a regimental commander, one who carried a gun and was followed by guards, not like that student playing the painted-face role! If Yuhua did anything, he would certainly suffer. Therefore, Yuqin felt as if a major disaster was about to happen.

The reason he was sitting alone worrying at this time was half because of Yuhua.

"What's the big deal? With so many people around, I doubt he'll do anything to me!" He deliberately spoke more lightly, hoping to ease Yuhua's mood.

"Wait and see!" The 20-year-old young performer became angry as soon as this matter was mentioned.

Yuqin originally wanted to ask him, "Could this Regimental Commander Yuan be the big fat man at Guanghe Tower that day who had a fierce look in his eyes and cheered the loudest?" But the words came to his lips, and he forcefully held them back. He knew that if he discussed this matter with him further, trouble would definitely erupt in a moment. It was best to mention it as little as possible. (7)

### "Singing for a Living" and Rickshaw Pullers

— Liang

I have also made a living by "singing for a living." What is "singing for a living"? It is being a teacher. A teacher takes a book and goes to the podium to lecture for an hour. Isn't that the same as a prostitute taking a huqin and being called to a restaurant to sing a little song or a Beijing tune? However, a prostitute only sings for a few minutes before patting the young master's shoulder and saying, "I'm leaving now, please come and play sometime," and that's it. But a teacher on the podium, like "a cat can jump and a dog can bark," must last for forty-five minutes or fifty minutes without stopping. The teacher's inferiority to the prostitute lies in this point. It seems I am not as good as her.

Is this still a matter of a few years ago? At that time, the salary of a middle school teacher was still one yuan or one and a half yuan per hour. But for a teacher with a family of five like me, the salary earned in a month was not enough to keep his wife and children from hunger. Since the August 13th Incident, the cost of living in Shanghai has increased seven or eight times, or even ten times or more, compared to a few years ago. But the salaries of teachers have decreased compared to the past, with some receiving five or six jiao per hour, and others receiving seven or eight jiao per hour. Not to mention elementary school teachers. What difference is there between the life of a teacher like this and that of someone crawling on the ground writing petitions!

The youth of today are the pillars of the future nation. The responsibility of educating and guiding the youth is extremely important and great. However, their treatment is not only inferior to that of prostitutes, but also beyond the reach of rickshaw pullers. A rickshaw puller will not accept a fare of less than four or five jiao for a journey of five or ten minutes or more. Therefore, the rickshaw puller's labor can earn him four or five yuan or five or six yuan per day. But how much money can a teacher earn per day? However, there are people who sympathize with rickshaw pullers, but few who sympathize with the lives of teachers. Alas!

### Aphorisms on Self-Cultivation (10)

Some people treat others with uniform humility and gentle attitudes, speaking considerately, without any harsh words or severe expressions. This is called a round life. Some people have a dignified attitude and speak righteously, without the slightest wavering between right and wrong. They are very serious about everything they do. This is called a square life. There are also those who speak sharply and have a calm attitude. This is called a pointed life.

(Above) Dizzy and lightheaded, eyes spitting fire.

Running east and west, barely enough to eat.

Everything is rising in price, tuition fees are not high.

Workers can strike, but I cannot.
