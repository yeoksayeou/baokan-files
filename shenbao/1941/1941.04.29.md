Editorial

### Aid to China and the Soviet Union

American public opinion is the source of politics and the embodiment of the highest power in the nation beyond constitutional provisions. The maturation of public opinion comes from the fierce rise and fall of opposing views, eventually leading to harmony and unity, and from the product of space and time. Roosevelt has been in office as President for nine years, and "the people are still the same, the country is still the same." However, the current method of providing maximum aid to Britain in the war was unimaginable last year. This is not because there is any difference in policies or personnel this year compared to last year; rather, it is because last year, public opinion was still in the midst of fierce rise and fall, not yet harmonized or unified, whereas this year, it has matured. Regarding aid to China, there has never been strong opposition. The main issues are the warmth of attitude, the weight of quality, and the urgency of timing. The trend shows a gradual shift from cold to hot, from light to heavy, and from slow to urgent. The space for the aid-to-China movement is expanding, and time is moving forward. In the near future, we will see the maturation of public opinion that treats aid to China and aid to Britain equally. The aid-to-China movement, aiming for equal treatment with Britain, has been rising at a rapid rate in the past three to four months. The other night, former US Ambassador to France Mr. Bullitt gave a speech to many prominent figures, urging equal support for China and Britain. His speech was based on eloquent facts and filled with passion, which will surely accelerate the maturation of this movement into public opinion. What is particularly gratifying is that the agreement for the US $50 million China Stabilization Fund and the British £5 million China Stabilization Fund, totaling 1.9 billion 法幣 (Chinese legal tender) at the Shanghai exchange rate, has just been signed and established. While some may be shocked by this huge sum, and others may be satisfied with this generous aid, Mr. Bullitt's speech came after the signing of the loan agreement. This best illustrates that those who understand the severity of the Far East issue, the value of China's war effort, and the direct connection between China's war and American well-being do not see this generous aid as the end, nor are they satisfied with this huge sum. Such a view should be gratifying not only to the Chinese people.

Mr. Bullitt's speech contained many cautionary words, such as "The only reason we (the United States) have not been attacked by Germany, Italy, and Japan is that they have no spare strength to reach us; Britain prevents Germany and Italy from disengaging in Europe, and Japan is similarly trapped by China; China is exhausting Japan, and its assistance to Britain and the United States is greater than what we have already assisted China; China is fighting for our safety, no less than Britain." These explanations are all accurate and incisive. From this, by discussing cause and effect, the fairness of rights and obligations, the pain and difficulty suffered by China and Britain, and the close relationship between the United States and China and Britain, one can inevitably reach the conclusion and assert that the United States must, and indeed urgently, aid China in the same form as aid to Britain, and provide China with the assistance it needs. Mr. Bullitt's speech also focused heavily on the Soviet Union. He believed that the recent neutrality pact signed by the Soviet Union and Japan was akin to the two countries becoming bandit brothers to divide China. He also believed that one of China's hopes was that the Soviet Union would eventually provide China with effective military assistance to defend against Japan, but the Chinese now know that this hope has been shattered. They also fear that the Soviet Union's current limited assistance to China may be cut off at the orders of Hitler. This view stems from his belief that "Communist countries are the enemies of all who live in freedom," revealing his prejudices and their origins. We need not dwell on the origins of his prejudices; however, we can take this opportunity to state our different observations: The result of the signing of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact certainly partially explains why the Soviet Union will not provide China with effective military assistance to defend against Japan; however, our observation is that China never hoped from the beginning that the Soviet Union would engage in military conflict with Japan for the sake of China, so it cannot now be regarded as the disillusionment of this hope. Secondly, the existence of contradictions between the Soviet Union and Japan will not be eliminated by the neutrality pact. The question is whether the Soviet Union will have such a day, engaging in military conflict with Japan for its own sake. As for whether the Soviet Union's aid to China will continue, it does not depend on Japan's desires but on the threat that the Soviet Union feels from Germany or Japan, whether it can overcome them, and what it cannot withstand. Its quantity does not depend on China's needs but on the strength that the Soviet Union has to spare. Whether it will revert to its old ways and divide China does not depend on the plans of the Soviet Union and Japan but on the success or failure of China's survival and self-reliance; it does not depend on the current desires and impulses of the Soviet Union and Japan but on the long-term interests of the Soviet Union. Regarding the Soviet Union, there have always been many in Britain and the United States who harbor deep-rooted suspicions, and Mr. Bullitt is likely one of them, which we do not wish to agree with. However, we sincerely wish to say one more word to Mr. Bullitt and some British and American people who share his views. We will not lightly discuss how the Soviet Union advances or retreats in Europe or how it makes friends or enemies. In the Far East, the situation seems chaotic but is actually simple, seems disorderly but is actually consistent. The future of the Far East is determined solely by the rise and fall of China. Without the China issue, there is almost no so-called Far East issue. The strength of the future voice of countries other than China in the Far East depends on the amount of support each country currently provides to China. No matter how it evolves, this is an inevitable and subtle formula!

### Madame Chiang Broadcasts to England, Saying that Britain is Fighting for Democracy and that Although There are Temporary Setbacks, Ultimate Victory is Inevitable

London: The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) rebroadcasted Madame Chiang's speech last night, expressing the Chinese people's sympathy and admiration for the British people. It stated that the British, like the Chinese people, are fighting for democracy. Any army cannot win every battle or gain advantages everywhere. As long as Britain's morale remains undiminished and its people remain strong, possessing the necessary conditions to continue fighting for freedom, it will inevitably achieve ultimate victory. Madame Chiang also appealed to Britain to donate to the China Relief Fund run by foreigners, saying that the Chinese people will never forget the aid given by Britain. China has been fighting for four years, and there are 50 to 60 million refugees. (Reuters dispatch of the 28th)

Chongqing: The BBC specially invited Madame Chiang Kai-shek to deliver a speech in English to Britain at 2:40 AM on the 28th. The BBC used a medium-wave and long-wave radio station to broadcast it nationwide on the 20th and used shortwave to report to the world at 3:45 AM. This is the first time that the BBC has invited an important figure from our country to speak. In order to ensure clear reception, the BBC specially asked Madame Chiang to broadcast in advance at 2 AM on the morning of April 20. The BBC recorded the sound in London, fearing that the reception would not be clear at the time, so that there would be time to re-broadcast and correct it. This shows its seriousness about this event. After Madame Chiang broadcasted at the Chongqing International Broadcasting Station on the 20th, a telegram was received from London stating that the reception was very satisfactory. The translated record of Madame Chiang's speech is as follows:

Friends in England, during our war against Japan, you have given China sympathy and assistance. I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak to you today and to briefly express the gratitude of my compatriots. The British donations to relieve China's disasters, formerly known as the "Sir Meyrick Relief Fund," have always encouraged our fight for freedom. We know that Britain is also engaged in a difficult life-and-death struggle, but British people are still doing their best to continue to support us. We Chinese have always been a nation that does not forget favors, and we will naturally never forget this expression of friendship from Britain. Today, my broadcast topic is about my

Relief Efforts. Four years of war have turned 50 to 60 million Chinese compatriots into refugees. Some have been temporarily settled, while others are still displaced and will not have a stable life until the end of the war. But they would rather endure this current hardship and difficulty than be ruled by the Japanese. Japanese planes have repeatedly bombed our undefended cities and villages in the rear. Taking Chongqing in June last year as an example, two days of continuous air raids left 70,000 residents homeless. Throughout the summer, on clear days and moonlit nights, Japanese planes bombed without fail. By winter, Chongqing was left with only dilapidated ruins and desolation. But today, if you

Come to Chongqing to Take a Look, what kind of impression would you get? Temporary, simple houses are being built as fast as bamboo shoots after rain. How is this possible? Because the Chinese spirit does not know the word failure. Those merchants, in the places where the Japanese dropped bombs and set fires, rebuild their huts and reorganize their old industries before the smoke and ashes cool down. Many organizations, such as the New Life Movement Association, church groups, and various cooperatives, under the leadership of the government, are helping the affected citizens with excellent results. We do not regard the affected compatriots as objects of pity but feel that they are worthy of respect. Patriotic citizens are active members of productive enterprises. The relief committee has been operating 17 handicraft and light industry factories and is actively promoting several

Reclamation Plans. 1.83 million refugees have been arranged to work on land reclamation. In 1938, the Japanese bombed the large bank of the Yellow River, burying more than 200,000 compatriots. Now, many refugees are also engaged in embankment repair work. At the beginning of the war, our country had only 6,000 registered doctors, and the army alone needed at least 50,000 military doctors. The supply of medical supplies was also severely short, so British friends, the doctors and medical equipment provided to us by the International Red Cross and the Chinese Red Cross have greatly benefited both our military and civilians. Here, I want to mention the important contribution of our country's women to the war. The General Association of Chinese Women's Comfort Corps has raised no less than

50 Million Yuan in medical supplies and medical relief funds over the past four years. Most of the staff in the front-line and rear hospitals are volunteers. They gladly sacrifice the comfort of their lives to serve the country. We are also providing education and care to the 25,000 refugee children rescued from the war zone, hoping that they will gradually forget the tragic experiences of the past and restore the joy and innocence that they should have in childhood under the care of loving caregivers. If we had sufficient tools and equipment, perhaps we could rescue even more refugee children. I have one last thing to say: there is no army in the world that wins every battle, and there is no army that wins everywhere. As long as a country's morale does not decline and the people's will does not waver, they will surely achieve

Final Victory. You can firmly believe that China will never lay down its weapons until justice is reaffirmed. Only in this way can we comfort the heroic spirits of those comrades who have made noble sacrifices. I hope you can feel that our struggle and Britain's struggle are both spiritually and in fact for the same goal. Because we have personally experienced it for four years, we sympathize with your current suffering more deeply than any other nation. To the British friends who are fighting bravely for democracy, we in China express our infinite sympathy and admiration. (Dispatch of the 28th)

### American Celebrities Call for Aid to Britain: Provide Military Aircraft to Enable Britain to Achieve Victory and Deliver Them by Warships to Their Destination

New York: Rockefeller, the son of the American oil magnate, sent a letter to the publisher of the New York Times, which stated that he firmly believed that the American people and the people of South American countries could actively assist the British Empire at any cost. Everyone, in particular, should work together to enable President Roosevelt to deliver a large amount of armaments to Britain, enough to enable Britain to achieve victory. The United States can only manufacture armaments, and if it cannot transport them to their destination, it will still be of no avail. The key is how to accomplish this task. This is the responsibility of President Roosevelt and his military advisors. (Havas, 27th)

New York: Mr. Douglas, chairman of the "Committee to Aid Britain in Defending America," recently issued a speech stating that the United States should dispatch warships to escort armaments to Britain. Although this policy is extremely dangerous, the loss of British merchant ships is "quite alarming." He said that if we are alone and friendless in the current world, it is also extremely dangerous. We can manufacture armaments and load them on ships, but we must be able to transport them to Britain for their use. (Havas dispatch of the 27th)

### Churchill's Broadcast Address Reaffirms Britain's Resolve to Fight, Dispelling Concerns About the Situation's Development, Meeting Difficulties with a Steady Gaze, New Crisis in the Mediterranean May Extend to Western Turkey and the Soviet Union

London - British Prime Minister Churchill (see picture) last night broadcast an address to all parts of Britain, reaffirming the unwavering determination of the British people to either win or die, urging listeners not to be alarmed by the current developments in Europe and Africa, and stating the reasons why Britain had to decide to send troops to aid Greece. In this address, Churchill highly praised the actions of the British people under the fierce German air raids, and also expressed his appreciation for the United States' decision to patrol the waters of the Western Hemisphere.

Departing for Inspection as if Ascending to the Bridge

Churchill said in his address that last week someone asked him if the people felt a little uneasy because of the severity of the war situation. In order to personally inspect the extent of the public's anxiety, he went to some of the most heavily bombed cities and ports, and the areas where the poor suffered the most. Now that he has returned, he is not only calm and at ease, but also in exceptionally high spirits. Leaving the Prime Minister's office, which is crowded with official duties and has no time all day, and entering the streets and docks of London, Liverpool, Manchester, Cardiff, and Swansea, is like leaving a stuffy room and ascending to the bridge of a warship. This is a tonic, and he would advise anyone who is tired and needs a boost to take it. The people's spirit is so high that it elevates humanity above the level of material facts and into a peaceful realm that seems not to exist in the current world. He was delighted to see it. The battlefield experience and emotions maintained by our country's sea and land soldiers for hundreds of years are now shared by all the people, regardless of gender, age, or weakness, all of whom are under enemy fire like soldiers. They are proud to be fighting alongside the soldiers on the front lines to the end. In short, the British people are determined to either win or die, which is truly the most heroic period in our history, with infinite glory. You can imagine how deeply he feels his responsibility. His responsibility to the people is to be in office and to help them safely through the difficult times they are currently facing.

Assisting Greece is to Preserve Honor

Churchill continued to talk about the war, saying that the British army, which had captured most of the Italian army in Libya, was very small in number, which few people in the world know. General Wavell, in his repeated victories, never used more than two divisions or 30,000 men at any one time. After the British army reached Benghazi, they received a call that was difficult to refuse. Last November, the Italian army attacked Greece without warning. The Greeks bravely fought back and defeated the Italian army. Hitler secretly arranged to help the aggressors. The lack of unity among the Balkan countries allowed Hitler to gather troops in the central Balkans. While the Greek army was severely defeating the Italian army, the German army took the opportunity to invade the Greek border. Greece, under this threat, asked for our help. Our strength was already strained, but we had to respond to this call. The Greeks had said that if neighboring countries did not help and Britain did not provide assistance, they would fight on their own, but we British could not ignore it, otherwise it would damage the honor of the British Empire. If we lose this honor, how can we hope for or deserve victory? Victory and defeat are not constant and are subject to change, so military actions or miscalculations can be remedied, but shameful and disgraceful behavior will cause us to lose the respect we currently enjoy in the world and will destroy the elements of our strength.

German Propaganda Strives to Drive a Wedge Between Britain and Australia

In the past year, we have, through our actions, gained the unprecedented goodwill of the American people. He dares to say that the actions of the United States are not based on calculations of gain or loss, but on the noble moral emotions that arise from the foundation of human life. We must do our limited best to respond to Greece's call. We consulted with Australia and New Zealand, and both governments declared their agreement without hesitation. Thus, an important mobile land army from part of the Nile River was sent to Greece to fulfill our promise. At that time, the most suitable troops to be mobilized for this campaign were those from Australia and New Zealand, and only half of those who participated in this campaign came from Britain. Now, German propaganda is trying to drive a wedge between Britain and Australia, pointing out that we are unwilling to use British troops for this campaign and are making Australian troops do it instead. He will let Australia deal with this kind of nonsense on its own. We certainly know that the military force that we can send to Greece is not enough to contain the tide of German aggression, but we did hope at the time that Greece's neighbors could take a stand of cooperation with Greece in time because of our participation in the war. As for how this hope was not realized, we will know in the future.

Italian Prime Minister's Boasting is Laughable and Shameful

Churchill also spoke of Yugoslavia, saying that "the loyal people of that country rose up against a government that sought to submit to Nazi rule and live in humiliation, in order to save their country's soul and future, but it was too late to protect its territory. The army had not yet been mobilized, the soldiers had not yet set out, and the enemy's mechanized units had already crossed the border. At the same time, the Greek army, with its vastly outnumbered forces, could not resist, and the victorious army in Albania was forced to disarm. Since this major change has occurred in the Balkans, the Australian army and others have had to fight on one side and retreat to the sea on the other. Newspapers now carry articles by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini congratulating his army on its victory in Greece. This is truly a laughable and shameful new record in the world. While this tragic event was taking place in the Balkans, our army in Libya was also suffering a worrying setback. The German army's advance was so rapid and its numbers so large that it was beyond the expectations of our generals. The British armored unit, which had previously defeated the Italian army, had to be reorganized, and a British armored brigade, which was originally expected to be able to hold the border until mid-May, had to retreat. Most of its vehicles were destroyed by the superior German armored forces, but our army still firmly defended the Tobruk fortress on the German side, where it repeatedly defeated the enemy and captured many prisoners. This is the recent situation of the war on the Libyan and Egyptian borders.

African War Will Become More Intense

We must now expect that the battles in the Mediterranean, the desert, and the sky will become more intense and widespread. However, our army has now cleared the Italian army in Cyrenaica and will now eliminate the German army. This is more difficult and cannot be accomplished in a short time. You all know that I never disguise defeat as victory. I have never underestimated the German army's combat power. A few months ago, I said that the rapid and continuous victories that our army had gained against the Italians might not continue, and we must be prepared for adversity. One thing that can be determined in the war is that the war is full of disappointments and mistakes. Now, Germany's trampling of the Balkan countries and the creation of a bloody and hateful divide between the Germans and the people of Greece and Yugoslavia is a major mistake that we will see in the future. If Germany, with its current army and supplies, makes the common-sense move to invade Egypt, it will be another mistake that we will have to wait to see in the future. He never wants to predict the outcome of any war that has not yet been fought, but he dares to say that if he sees the armies of both sides in the Middle East exchanging their tasks, and the army led by General Wavell replacing the position of the German army, then he will be very unhappy. This is his personal opinion, and he knows that there may be different observations. In addition to the threat to Egypt, there is almost certainly a new crisis in the Mediterranean. The war may spread to Spain and Morocco in the future, and may even extend to Turkey and the United States. Germany may reach out to seize the granary of Ukraine and the oil wells of the Caucasus, and who can say if it will even covet the Caspian Sea? We can only do our best to deal with it. Wherever the enemy goes, we will fight there. But one thing is certain: Hitler, whether in the East, the Middle East, or the Far East, will not escape the condemnation of justice. If Hitler wants to achieve his goal of victory, he must conquer Britain or cut off the communication lines between Britain and the United States.

Go All Out to Deal with the Atlantic War

At the beginning of February this year, when he gave a broadcast address, many people thought that the Nazi invasion of Britain was imminent and would soon begin, but the invasion of Britain has not yet been implemented, and our navy, army, and air force have been strengthening their numbers, equipment, combat power, and training every month. In the future, we can guarantee our island. When he compares the current domestic situation with last summer, he feels that we can be happy. He believes that if we do not slacken our efforts, we will eventually show very good results. Saying too much is exaggeration, and being a little lacking in self-confidence is also foolish. So what will be the result of our life in the Atlantic Ocean? What will happen if many ships carrying food that people depend on for their livelihoods are sunk? What will happen if the large amount of war materials that the United States is now planning to transport to Britain are blocked on the way? Hitler threatened in February to intensify the submarine and air war, but we have taken all possible plans to deal with this kind of attack. It is still the same now. We are now concentrating on defending against it. This is what is called the Atlantic War. If we want to survive, we must win this victory. When we think of how easy it is to sink ships and how difficult it is to build ships, when we think of the fact that we have no fewer than two thousand ships sailing on the sea, and no fewer than three or four hundred ships sailing in dangerous areas, and when we think of the large army we are maintaining in the Near East and protecting our communications in the world, we should know how much those who bear the responsibility for winning attach importance to the Atlantic War.

Very Pleased with American Aid

He is very pleased to hear about the major plans recently decided by the American president and people, which Britain can express in words. The American fleet and naval aircraft have now been ordered to patrol the vast sea of the Western Hemisphere to protect the ships of all countries. The American government and people recognize that Britain's war is justified and know that if Britain fails, American interests will also be harmed, so they have made a solemn promise to help Britain in the war. The United States is now providing its resources, using its industry, and exporting its weapons to meet Britain's needs. He knows that it certainly does not want to see its noble actions be ineffective halfway and allow the products of its factories to sink to the bottom of the sea. The submarine warfare carried out by Germany is far contrary to the international agreements that Germany recognized a few years ago. This is not an effective blockade, but a massacre. He is sure that although the Atlantic War will be long and difficult, and its outcome has not yet been decided, it has now entered a more difficult but more satisfying stage. The United States is now closely united with us and is giving us spiritual, material, and naval assistance. Looking at the determination announced by the United States, Hitler and Mussolini will undoubtedly fail. The Huns have a population of less than 70 million, most of whom have been used to suppress the Austrian, Czech, and other ethnic groups. The British and American people number 200 million, already have naval power, and are gradually gaining an advantage in the sky. Their resources, skills, and steel are far beyond what Germany can reach. They have decided not to allow freedom to be trampled by dictators, nor to allow the tide of world progress to be reversed because of this. We are inevitably worried about the development of the three continents of Europe, Africa, and Asia, but there is no reason to panic. We must face the current difficulties with a steady gaze. What is happening in the East now is far less serious than what we encountered last year. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)

### The German-Italian Allied Forces in North Africa Advance Beyond the Egyptian Border; British Naval and Land Forces are Strenuously Containing Them; German Troops Near Benghazi are Bombed

Khartoum Yesterday, the Axis forces invading Egypt and its borders, consisting of two columns of motorized troops, presumably mostly Italian, are east south of the Solum escarpment. Informed sources believe that the enemy's advance is no more than fifteen to twenty miles from the sea and shows no signs of southward disturbances. Activity along the line is limited to the area from Capuzzo to Solum. The battle situation is similar to that when the Italian army reached Sidi Barrani last September, except that the invading enemy forces are believed to be much smaller than the four or five divisions used by the Italian side to attack Sidi Barrani last year. The enemy's invasion has been plagued by British armored forces, resulting in some loss of materiel. British armored vehicles are constantly in contact with the enemy forces to impede their advance. Informed sources believe that the enemy may attack Sidi Barrani, but even if the enemy reaches there, the situation will be even more unfavorable to the enemy than last year because its forces are not very strong, and the British army is firmly stationed in Tobruk. Apart from Tobruk, there has been little enemy air activity to date. (Reuter, 28th)

Cairo Yesterday, British troops and mechanized units fought fiercely with German and Italian forces in North Africa to prevent their advance. These Axis troops have already admitted to having crossed the Egyptian border near Solum and penetrated twenty-five miles east of Sidi Barrani. British headquarters said today that British forces are advancing along the coastal road and that British ground forces are repeatedly attacking the enemy's flanks to impede their advance. There is no sign that German and Italian forces are advancing south from Egypt. (International News Service, 28th)

London Recently, German forces in North Africa have received a large number of reinforcements and have begun a general offensive against Alexandria (the British naval port in Egypt) and the Suez Canal. German troops have penetrated Egyptian territory in several places. According to British official reports, British forces blocking the German advance have been pushed back. German and Italian mechanized troops, after driving east for four hundred miles from Cyrenaica, have been encamped on the Egyptian border for two weeks, constantly accumulating reinforcements and supplies in preparation for a direct assault on Cairo. During this period, the front-line fighting has been quiet, with only minor contact. However, the British army has also been rushing reinforcements from East Africa to meet the enemy. The purpose of the German offensive, which began immediately after the end of the Balkan war, is clearly to resolve the battle before the British troops in Greece can be transferred back to Africa. At the same time, the German side is stepping up pressure on Spain to coordinate with the Egyptian offensive, with the aim of using the German western pincer to close the Strait of Gibraltar. (Associated Press, 28th)

Cairo According to official announcements, British armored patrols are now in contact with enemy forces that have crossed the Egyptian border. On Sunday, when several Junkers transport planes landed at the Qinnina airfield near Benghazi, they were attacked by British fighter planes.

British fighter planes also strafed oil tankers and enemy forces between Derna and Bardia, inflicting heavy damage. (Reuter, 28th)

The Italian Stronghold of Dessie in East Africa Captured by the British

Khartoum The war in Abyssinia is proceeding smoothly and will soon be over, with the complete occupation of Italian East Africa. The British defense forces in Sudan occupied the Motta fortress on Thursday, capturing twelve enemy officers and hundreds of colonial troops, and seizing two cannons, one fighter plane, and a large amount of stored military supplies. According to Italian colonial troops who deserted and surrendered to the British army in the Amba Alagi area, desertions from the Italian colonial army are increasing daily, so many units are now being liberated. (Reuter, 28th)

Nairobi According to an official announcement here, Dessie, an important stronghold of the Italian army in Abyssinia, was occupied by British troops last Saturday. The city is one of the last resistance bases in Italian East Africa. The communiqué stated that our army entered Dessie at 6:00 p.m. on Saturday. At present, the Italian army has only two options: to retreat eastward towards French Somaliland or to continue fighting along the road north of Dessie. The Italian army suffered heavy casualties around the city, with more than 300 dead, 600 wounded, and 500 captured. At present, the only larger bases of the Italian army in Abyssinia are Gondar and Jimma. (Reuter, 28th)

Rome The High Command stated that the Italian army, unable to withstand the pressure of the British army, withdrew from Dessie, the last fortress in Abyssinia. (Associated Press, 28th)

Addis Ababa British troops are now advancing on the last strongholds of resistance by the Italian army in Abyssinia, and preparations for King Selassie's return to the capital are also actively underway. Many civilian houses are flying the blue, gold, and red Ethiopian flag. Patriotic Ethiopian troops have now taken over the defense of the artillery at the capital's airport. A certain hospital in the capital has also opened a special ward for the treatment of wounded Ethiopian soldiers, and Ethiopian women are serving as nurses. News from the front states that the war is proceeding smoothly. In the Campo Chevo Pass (controlling the road to Dessie), South African British troops fighting the Italian army have advanced another two miles. At the same time, Nigerian British troops fighting in the Fiche area of the capital destroyed an enemy motor transport convoy and are continuing to pursue enemy troops in the mountains. In addition, a British Air Force communiqué stated that a hangar storing enemy aircraft at the Makalle airfield was bombed by the British Air Force. Enemy forces and fortresses on Lake Tana were also bombed and strafed. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuter, 28th)

### Bullitt Urges US Aid to China to Be Like US Aid to Britain; Strongly Attacks the Soviet-Japanese Treaty

Washington Former US Ambassador to France William Bullitt broadcast to the American people last night, saying that the battlefield in China is, from a strategic point of view, "our country's western front." He called on all Americans not only to aid China with all their resources and strength but also to deliver the necessary goods to China in an effective way. Bullitt strongly argued that the United States should take steps to ensure that all arms, ammunition, and aircraft are delivered to China and to keep this lifeline for US aid to China open forever, the same as it treats Britain, knowing that "China's war effort contributes to our country's security no less than Britain's." Bullitt advocated giving China all the aid it needs so that China will no longer have to rely on the Soviet Union. Bullitt also said that even with Japan attacking China, it is morally and materially moving towards unity and strength. One of the biggest reasons for Japan's attack on China in 1937 was to stop China's progress because China's national strength was developing so rapidly. Japan saw that China was superior to Japan in terms of numbers, resilience, and knowledge. Japan felt that the opportunity to enslave China like Korea would soon be lost. Bullitt also recalled his visit to Chiang Kai-shek in 1934, saying that Chiang Kai-shek had predicted to him at that time that Japan would attack China and said that although Chiang Kai-shek believed that Japan might win a temporary victory, he was confident that the final victory would be China's. Bullitt continued that Britain has contained the German and Italian forces across the Atlantic, while China has contained Japan within China, preventing Japan from launching a naval war outside the Chinese war to attack Britain and our country. This China, which contains Japanese power, has already done a very great service to the American people, and the Chinese people have done this service for us far greater than any service we have done for China. China's war effort contributes to America's security no less than Britain's war effort. Bullitt then issued a warning that to maintain China's heroic action, even greater assistance is needed. Bullitt also spoke of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, saying that the Chinese people originally believed that this war against Japan was also attacking Japan on behalf of the Soviet Union, so they all expected the Soviet Union to help to the end. Now the Chinese people have seen Stalin and Matsuoka embracing at the Moscow station. China's only hope at that time was that the Soviet Union could always help China to resist Japan, but today China has seen that this hope, on Hitler's orders, is afraid that not even a drop of aid can be given. Bullitt also declared that communist countries are enemies of all mankind living in freedom. The United States should directly aid China and should do so alone, knowing that helping China is helping the United States. China and Britain are now under severe pressure. For the sake of our own salvation, we must exhaust our country's production of national defense tools. We must not only step up production but also properly send these goods to China and Britain. If we hesitate and covet temporary peace, we will perish. We can no longer leisurely choose between peace and war. The only path we can choose now is to keep our country's lifeline to China and Britain open and to do our best to help these two countries; otherwise, we will be fighting alone in this hemisphere against the combined forces of dictators with resources from Europe, Asia, Africa, and most of South America. We must now choose to back China and Britain regardless of the consequences. Helping China and Britain with all our resources and strength may not avoid war, but whether war can be avoided or not, we must help China and Britain. If the dictators want to fight us, we should let them know that this country (the United States) has never known the word "defeat," and we should let them know that this nation, which opposes the conspiracies and ambitions of these people, values freedom more than life. We should let them know that this trumpet, made by the unconquerable soul of mankind, never blows a retreat. Bullitt severely criticized the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty, believing that this agreement has made the Soviet Union and Japan band together as robbers and sacrifice China. Bullitt also said that, however, no one would be so naive as to believe that the Soviet Union and Japan could turn enemies into friends, and said that Stalin was forced to sign this treaty on Hitler's orders. He also said that the Soviet-Japanese Treaty was a gift from Hitler to the Japanese warlords, making Japan feel safe in the north and able to resolutely attack the British and Dutch territories in the east and fight against the British Empire and the United States. Bullitt also said that anyone who believes that America's security can be guaranteed without worry is delusional. "The only reason we have not been attacked by Germany, Italy, and Japan is that they are not yet able to attack us." It is also reported that no fewer than 3,000 people listened to Bullitt, representing the United China Relief Association, deliver a speech in the chamber of the parliament, including government officials, diplomats, and social celebrities. In addition, the new Chinese Foreign Minister Quo Tai-chi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China T.V. Soong were also present to listen to the speech. When Quo Tai-chi arrived, the entire audience greeted him with warm applause. The chairman of the United China Relief Association, Federal Security Administrator McNutt and his wife, presided over the meeting and decided to donate US$5 million to combine with Chinese relief affairs.

### Carol to Fly to Chile

### European War Commentary (48) The Power of the Flying Fortress

President Roosevelt said, "America is the arsenal of democracy." This is certainly not empty talk, given the scale and speed of production in the US arms manufacturing industry.

The democracies need US arms, mainly airplanes, and especially yearn for the assistance of the US "Flying Fortress." The so-called Flying Fortress is a huge bomber, no different from a flying battery. It is equipped with bulletproof defenses and can carry a large number of bombs to bomb thousands of miles away. Its destructive power is far beyond the reach of ordinary bombers.

Douglas and Boeing are famous in the United States for manufacturing Flying Fortresses, which can compete with Germany's most powerful dive bombers and Messerschmitt aircraft. However, the largest factory in the history of aircraft manufacturing is the Douglas plant, which created the Douglas B.19 super bomber, the so-called Flying Fortress. The Douglas plant, which manufactures this type of aircraft, is the largest commercial airport in the United States. It has three manufacturing plants near Los Angeles, California, employing 40,000 workers and manufacturing various types of military aircraft, such as the DB-7 and SBD-1.

The manufacturing project of this type of aircraft is huge. At least 9,000 different drawings were made before the first one, ordered by the US Army Department, was started. Then 500 engineers, technicians, and machinists were mobilized, taking four years and costing $2 million, until it was recently completed, and it is generally recognized as the largest and most powerful bomber in the world. The Douglas B19 Flying Fortress is made of all metal. The fuselage is 132 feet long, the wingspan is 212 feet long, and the height is 42 feet 9 inches. It has a fuel capacity of 11,000 gallons and is equipped with four Cyclone engines, each with a power equivalent to 1,000 horsepower. The landing rubber wheels are 96 inches in diameter and weigh 2,700 pounds each. The maximum speed is 100 miles per hour. It has a crew of ten and can carry 18 tons of bombs, with a range of up to 7,500 miles. In other words, it can fly back and forth between Honolulu and Tokyo, or between New York and Europe, without stopping. Its bombing power can withstand 36 German dive bombers.

The Douglas B19 weighs 80 to 100 tons and is not only suitable for long-range bombing but can also transport soldiers to the battlefield, carrying 125 fully armed soldiers each time.

However, the Douglas B19 takes a long time to manufacture, which is too slow to meet urgent needs. Therefore, the current popular "Flying Fortresses" are all Boeings. The power of this type of aircraft also exceeds that of ordinary bombers by several times.

The Boeing aircraft factory is located in Seattle and uses mass production methods to produce large quantities to meet the urgent needs of the country and foreign countries. The factory is divided into several main parts. (1) The pattern-making department has 500 experts, and each aircraft requires a total of 5,500 drawings from various departments, covering an area of 18,578 square feet. (2) The allocation department. The factory manufactures multiple aircraft at the same time, and each aircraft requires 29,600 parts to be matched. Therefore, each part must be manufactured in order and applied in time. The department has precise statistics on the manufacturing situation. The status of a certain part of a certain aircraft, whether it has not been manufactured, is being manufactured, or has been completed, can be seen at a glance. (3) The manufacturing department, which includes a mold-making workshop, pressing the fuselage and wings; a riveting workshop, drilling holes with electricity and riveting the frame parts; an electric welding workshop, welding all kinds of lead pipes needed for the entire aircraft, 5,400 feet; and a wiring department, installing 1,422 sections of long and short wires needed for the entire aircraft, totaling three and a half miles. In addition, there are raw material department and packaging department, etc.

The Boeing B17 bomber is 68 feet long, the wingspan is over 100 feet long, and the height is 15 and a half feet high. It is equipped with four 1,400 horsepower engines, and there are machine gun emplacements on both sides and at the rear. The range is 3,000 to 4,000 miles, and the maximum speed is 300 miles per hour. The crew consists of seven to nine people. After flying from the United Kingdom to bomb Berlin and returning home, it can continue to fly 2,000 miles, or fly from the United Kingdom to bomb southern Italy or the Skoda armory in Czechoslovakia and return freely overnight.

Boeing's manufacturing rate was about one aircraft every two weeks a year ago, now it is about one aircraft every four days, and it is expected to be one aircraft every two days soon. The US Army Department has ordered 500 aircraft from the factory, and they have been delivered one after another, dozens of which have been transferred to the United Kingdom by the British government for use.

### Grains What is the Reason for Setting a New Price Limit? Or Why Was It Abolished?

With No Proper Follow-Up Measures, Rice Prices Soared; Speculators Were Unscrupulous and Raised Prices by Over Ten Dollars in a Single Day; Market Prices Were Over Twenty Dollars Higher Than When Prices Were Limited; Over Fifty Thousand Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived, and Japonica Rice Also Rose by Five or Six Dollars

Yesterday, the Bureau of Public Works announced the cancellation of the price limit for foreign rice without proper follow-up measures. As a result, people were agitated and demand increased. Speculators were unscrupulous, and in addition to actual sales to retailers, scattered households, merchants, and rural households, new speculators and outsiders were particularly active. Large households collectively defended and raised prices, while floating households released prices and competed to buy, and the market price soared under the influence of these factors. The price rose sharply and was difficult to contain. No. 1 Western rice was quoted at $136.50, which was still close to the black market price on Saturday. It then rose from $137, $138, $139 to $140, then added one or two dollars, and closed at $145. Informal trading in the afternoon remained active, and the price was raised again by two to three dollars. As a result, it rose by four to five or eight to nine dollars compared to last weekend. The original Ying Wah Sze bag also saw extraordinary activity, with small bags quoted at $162 for spot goods, $153 for futures, and broken rice at $130 for spot goods, $128 to $129.50 for futures, and the market price for rice at $130, with transactions of no less than 2,000 tons and more than 30,000 bags for spot goods. New transactions included 600 tons of Heyi's small bag for the upper period of May, priced at $156.20. In short, the price limit is like the belly of a fat merchant. Each time it is released, it widens once. The bellies of the masses, however, are restricted once and deflate once.

A Large Quantity of Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's steamship arrived on Saturday (26th), carrying 10,800 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Beihai steamship arrived in Shanghai on the same day, also carrying 8,337 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Jiangsu steamship arrived on the 27th, carrying 10,490 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Taiyuan steamship also arrived in Shanghai on the 27th, carrying 4,407 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Ganzhou steamship also arrived on the 27th, also carrying 500 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng steamship also arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (17th), carrying 17,112 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. A total of six ships arrived in succession, carrying a total of 56,546 bags of foreign rice. A large quantity of foreign rice arrives continuously, and rice prices rise continuously. This kind of scene loses the common sense of reason. I really don't know how far it will be allowed to go before they are willing to think for the public. (Ancestor)

Both Thick and Thin Japonica and other national rice have arrived in scarce quantities, and the market price has been shoulder to shoulder with foreign rice, causing stores to consider it cheaper and demand is quite strong. At the same time, goods see foreign rice repeatedly surging, and the selling mentality is also firm. Under the dual circumstances, the market prices of both thick and thin Japonica rice all rose by a huge five or six dollars. It is estimated that high Kunshan tin Japonica rice is $140, secondary is $138, and the blue corner of the bucket sees thin Japonica rice at $136, and secondary down to $132 or $133. The glutinous rice market is flying high across all goods. Not only are there brisk retail sales to rice porters and cake shops, but also large households are hoarding, so the selling price has also seen an increase. However, it is not as remarkable as the national and foreign rice, with an increase of only three or four dollars. It is estimated that Hong Kong white rice is $124,000 and glutinous tea is $118.

### The Flour Market is Initially Stable, Then Firm; There is Talk of a Supply Suspension for Pingbao Flour

The flour market is initially stable, then firm. The opening market in the morning was still stable, because the actual sales to merchants were not fierce, and the cargo owners were not eager to sell. Jinlong brand sifted flour traded over a thousand bags, priced at $4.04, and Huawu brand Australian flour traded five hundred bags, priced at $31. However, the Pingmai flour from this factory was sold until yesterday because there was insufficient raw materials. The supply is temporarily suspended, and the quantity and price will be determined again starting next month. In addition, the rice price soared, and people's hearts were suddenly aroused, so the selling price in the later market has been shouted up three or four cents, and all those who held the goods were guarding and hoarding for profit, so the transaction saw rejection.

The wheat trading volume was as light as ever yesterday. Durham wheat has reached the order decline, and domestic arrivals can be said to be extinct. The market supply source has long been interrupted, so buying and selling has stopped invisibly. The factory's retail sales are also without goods to collect.

### Price Limit Lifted, No Drastic Change in Oil Cakes Yet

Yesterday, the concession authorities also abandoned the price limit on the miscellaneous grain and oil cake market, so the transaction situation was still lively. It is estimated that 250 pieces of raw oil, 100 loads of factory oil, 100 barrels of Dalian oil, over two dried bags of various soybeans, over three thousand bags of corn spot goods, three to four hundred tons of futures, and over thirty thousand pieces of spot and futures soybean cakes were traded. However, although the market price was largely outside the price limit under the encouragement of good opportunities for people's hearts, its potential energy was limited due to limited actual sales, and the number of chips on the market was still abundant, inevitably stifling the atmosphere of activity. Therefore, predicting the future, I am afraid it will not be as horizontally leaping as the rice market.

### Finance Foreign Exchange with Large Settlements, Foreign Rice, Kerosene, and Cotton

In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's official rate was announced at 9:30 AM, with the US dollar rebounding to 0.0625, calculated at $5.215. Dutch and Swiss rates followed suit, while French and German rates were inactive, and other rates remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American currencies initially eased and then rebounded, mainly because the signing of the Sino-British-American Monetary Agreement inevitably triggered selling pressure. Speculators were the first to unload, and foreign banks such as American banks showed interest. The US dollar was strongest, with settlements possible at $5.21875. Around 9:30 AM, it was suddenly reported that import firms dealing in rice, oil, and cotton were aggressively buying, and speculators also shifted to accepting, halting the easing trend. Around noon, it softened to $5.15625, but soon rebounded to the original level. In the afternoon, speculators continued to buy aggressively. Chinese banks such as the East Asia Bank sold US$100,000, and British banks such as the Chartered Bank also sold. The situation remained stable, and the May US dollar only tightened by 0.03125, calculated at $5.15625. Spot and forward British gold, as well as forward US dollars, all closed flat, with brisk trading.

Speculation also driving buying

Since morning, overseas news reported that silver was uniquely strong, while the US and British currencies were flat. The exchange rate between various countries saw the US dollar rise by 0.25 against the British pound, while other rates remained flat. At the opening of the domestic market, the selling prices of banks were: spot British exchange at 3/1875, US dollar at $5.1875, and the Russian ruble immediately strengthened to $5.21875. After speculators sold a small amount to Chinese banks, the Russian ruble saw an American bank sell to Shanghai Continental and Zhejiang Industrial at the same price. Suddenly, it was reported that importers were making large-scale purchases, also at $5.21875 for April and May. Speculators also turned to buying at the same price, and the easing trend stopped, followed by a rebound. HSBC's official British rate was flat, and after the US dollar rose, importers and speculators again rushed to buy the April-May US dollar at $5.1875. Near noon, it was difficult to settle at the above price, but soon rebounded to the original level. At noon, the market price for British gold was 3/1875, and the US dollar was $5.1875.

Chartered Bank sold April US dollars to Chinese banks at $5.1875. Spot prices also softened, making settlement at the above prices difficult, but soon rebounded to the original level. At the 4:00 PM closing, spot prices and May futures for British exchange were all at 3/1875. Spot and April US dollars were both at $5.1875, while May futures were at $5.15625.

### Four Banks Reopen, Gold Market Rises Higher, Influx of Idle Funds Rush to Purchase Cash for Storage

Yesterday's gold market in the silver and unofficial markets initially fell but then suddenly rose. Prices have crossed the $6,700 threshold. Public confidence has greatly stabilized due to the formal reopening of the Four Banks. However, with abundant idle funds, there was a rush to buy foreign exchange and cash. After the agricultural opening, foreign banks closed out their long positions. After seeing a low price of $6,645, news that foreign exchange was tightening due to speculative buying and settlement by foreign firms spurred buying. Gold firms and securities houses rushed to buy, and short positions were quickly covered. The rise accelerated further at noon, exceeding $6,700. In the afternoon, a certain money house aggressively bought, rising to $6,730, which was then sold off by exchange brokers, falling back by $20. It ultimately rose by $37. Trading was brisk throughout the day, totaling about 30,000 taels. For intermonth swaps (April rolling into May), the seller, Chengji, posted 80 taels to Yongcheng, with a spread of $40, which then fell back by $10. The rise in cash prices was even faster, due to the influx of idle funds and a sudden increase in buying power. Yida sold 30 taels to Defu at a price $150 higher than the forward price. Yongfengyu sold one hundred and several dozen taels to Zhongyu at a price $155 higher. Gold firms sold 50 taels to money houses at a price $160 higher, rising to $170 higher at noon, with buyers present. In the afternoon, Chengji sold one hundred taels each to Shunyuan and Decheng at a price $160 higher, a rise of about $50. Jewelry gold reversed from falling to rising, ultimately rising by $5, calculated at $710. Customs gold and other currencies were flat.

Silver Rises $37

The market opened at 9:15 AM at $6,650 per bar (ten taels), $25 lower than last Saturday's noon closing price, due to the reopening of the Four Banks and the release of short positions. It then fell to $6,645. Suddenly, news that the US dollar had rebounded from weak to flat, with settlement difficult at $5.21875, boosted confidence. Chengji and Dafeng aggressively bought, raising the price to around $6,670. Unexpectedly, after 10:00 AM, Yiyuan, Renchengyong, Yida, Chida, and Defu all rushed to buy, raising it to around $6,690, and then fluctuating. Xinfengyong was aggressively selling, and Defu sometimes resold. After 11:00 AM, settlement was difficult at US$5.1875, and retail investors rushed to buy even more eagerly. Shihe bought three hundred and several dozen taels, raising it to $6,713. Deda, Chengji, and Xinfengyong sold in small amounts up to $6,700 at noon, closing at $6,703. The market then rose to $6,715 in the afternoon after a 2:00 PM opening, $12 higher than the noon closing price. Retail investors sold in small amounts up to $6,705. Yida and Dafeng bought, and the US dollar softened, so the price rose gradually. Shunyuan aggressively bought, raising it to $6,730. Exchange brokers Xinfengyong and Jufengyong, as well as securities houses and banks, sold off, and small amounts were seen at $6,708. The market closed at 4:00 PM at $6,712, a rise of $37 from last Saturday's noon closing. Based on the May US dollar settlement price of $5.15625, it was calculated at $6,754, a discount of $42. The price fluctuated by $85 throughout the day. The cash firm's own price was $180 higher than the spot price, buying at $80 lower than the selling price. Spot gold was not priced and inactive.

Jewelry Gold Relisted at $710

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael reversed from falling to rising. Datongxing and Xintongxing lowered it by $5 to $700 at 9:15 AM. It rebounded by $5 at 10:00 AM, and rose by another $5 at 2:00 PM, reaching $710, a rise of $5. Buying was at $40.

### Securities, Bond Market Again Appears Uncertain

The unofficial market for public bonds saw a weakening trend immediately after opening yesterday. The Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks did indeed reopen yesterday morning. Because the public bond market knew of this news last Saturday, those who were long continued to add to their positions, causing the appetite to feel satiated. After the Four Banks reopened, high-priced positions were released, so market prices reversed and fell slightly. Confidence was relaxed again. At the initial opening in the morning, it fell slightly. Tongkang, Hongda, Dasheng, Xingxie, Kangxie, and Yuanda Hua all sold. Shunchang's appetite to buy was still strong. Qia Tai Hengfu Shengda Jiufu also had needs, but the support was still weak. The noon closing fell by two or three cents. In the afternoon, Tongkang continued to sell. Xie Kang Wuhe also sold a lot. Yichang, Xinming, and Hongda were all seeking to sell. Xin Feng Qia Tai Shun Chang Jiu Feng Chang Kang Yong Kang Dun Yu and Heng Kang in the market either covered shorts or went long. The amounts varied. There were all buyers. Supply still exceeded demand. Categories A and C both broke $4, Categories E and D both broke $3, and Category B also broke $6. The trend was unstable. The result was a uniform drop of 4.5 to 7.5 cents. The turnover was approximately $2 million. A brief summary table is listed below.

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 73.20 73.35 73.35 Down 0.70

Unified B 66.70 65.95 66.00 Also Down 0.70

Unified C 64.75 63.85 63.95 Also Down 0.70

Unified D 63.10 62.60 62.60 Also Down 0.45

Unified E 63.60 62.80 62.85 Also Down 0.75

96 6.40 —— 6.40 Also Down 0.60

In stock trading, 200 shares of Dahua Matches were traded at a price of $33.75.

The public industry stock market opened and continued to rise, then turned uncertain. High prices could not be maintained. The closing trend was still stable. Several famous stocks had "ex-dividend" prices yesterday. This should not be confused with last Friday's closing price. Although the potential of rubber stocks was strong, it was not very active.

### Yarn & Cotton Dou Ma Brand Speculation, Slightly Rising with Gold Market, Hard for Miscellaneous Yarn to Sell

The yarn market turned from low to high, but the actual situation showed little progress. This was because the difficulty of transportation prevented companies from moving. However, longs believed that yarn mills would inevitably reduce production due to electricity conservation issues, so the desire to go long remained firm. However, the outlet was narrow, and the two factors canceled each other out, so the market entered a period of stagnation. The high price for 20-count Dou Ma yarn was $1,496, and the low price was $1,480. Initially, it was trading at $1,492 in the afternoon. Later, it was reported that the price of silver was continuing to rise, so it rose again to $1,499. The final price was $1,495-6. Currently, the yarn market fluctuated with silver prices. However, spot transactions were rare. In short, this was not a fundamental solution. Moreover, apart from the Dou Ma standard, which was passed around, other yarn brands were more difficult to sell.

The Dou Ma Brand opened in the morning, and market sentiment was peaceful. In addition, the Four Banks had reopened, and speculative forces were weaker. The opening price was $1,482. It then rose slightly to $1,487. At this time, Tianjin merchants, securities firms, and others sold off, dropping it again to $1,480. It fluctuated between $1,483 for a long time. At the same time, Guangdong merchants did not trade. However, after the news that silver prices had improved, longs pulled and lifted prices, raising it to $1,496. When prices were high, profit-takers released their positions, and shorts became active, pushing the market down. The closing price was $1,492. An analysis of the amount of turnover by different merchant groups for the half-day statistics of 6,360 bales is listed below:

Hong Kong 120 Same Industry 6,200

Mainland 40 Statistics 6,360

### Cotton Arrivals Still Flooding In, Transactions Cold and Quiet

The current cotton situation is quiet and desolate. This is because recent arrivals have been crowded, and the owners all made profits and were eager to sell to avoid warehousing rent and miscellaneous fees. However, the recent environment has been unfavorable, and yarn prices are not planned, so sales are slow. Mills must oppress and reduce production due to electrical saving issues, and there are no methods for raw materials, so the market has the risk of falling. Yesterday, Shenxin and (former Guangqin) two yarn factories dealt in a little bit of coarse fleece for a total of 740 bales. Tongfeng imported 200 pieces of Brazilian cotton. The breakdown is as follows:

South Taicang Cotton 208 240 Bales Delivered to Factory

Huoji Cotton 205 and

Huoji Cotton 207 Shenxin 2200 Bales Again

Brazilian Cotton 330 Tongfeng 200 Pieces Delivered to Warehouse

Another news item: the foreign cotton trade of foreign firms in Shanghai Port is still uninterested due to the impact of the current situation, but the market is still firm. Yesterday, in addition to 34 small batches of Brazilian cotton and Indian cotton, there was no other news. The New York cotton market was quiet and firm, rising due to buying and short covering. As a result, closing prices were up 2-8 points from the previous day. The Indian cotton market initially rose due to short covering and continuous support from buyers, but was then pushed down by speculative profit-taking. Finally, closing prices rose again due to spot merchants buying. As a result, closing prices rose except for White Low grade going to 4-5 month rising 9 rupees and 7-8 month rising 5 rupees, the rest rose about 1 rupee each. It is also predicted that the market situation will continue to rise half a rupee at the opening today.

### Piece Goods, Cloth Led by Yarn Higher

The trend of the factory cloth market was flat yesterday, with the market slightly firmer in the afternoon, because although cloth sales were sluggish, raw yarn suddenly saw an upward trend again. Sales prices varied. White goods, fine cloth, and western materials rose by $0.20 to $0.50 per bolt. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth, fine yarn, and line woven products were particularly firm. Inside and outside holders absorbed more. Poplin etc. rose by $0.35 to $0.50 per bolt. More than 600 pieces of various cloths were traded in the street. Guangdong-Hong Kong firms handled more than 100 pieces of Hua Feng blue cloth etc. Firms from abroad in Singapore and other places handled more than 6,000 bolts of bleached cloth bleached twill khaki etc. The real sales of Dongbu are still mediocre, so the rise of mid-range fine cloth is weak, but inside and outside holders show no small appetite. The price of high-end fine cloth rose by $0.40 per bolt, and the price of each brand of fine twill rose by $0.25 to $0.50. Because the 42-count fine yarn line of the Four Gentlemen brand saw a high market again, buyers flocked and supply was severely lacking, rising sharply by over $0.02 per yard. The closing price in the afternoon was $1.555.

### Sugar Market Raw White Rises Again the Near and Far Months Rise Equally

Yesterday, the sugar market was booming, and the trend rose again. In the trade association closing, the spot 24 raw white sugar opened flat, $99.80. Not long after, it jumped over the $100 mark again, trading at $101 to $102, an increase of $2. The large lot for the end of the month initially traded at $99.70 to $100, then $100.20, $101, $1.50, and $2.10, an increase of $2.10. The lot to be invoiced by the 10th of next month traded at $101.70 to $102, $102.50, $103, $103.80, closing at $103.50, an increase of $2. Taikoo Car White B traded at $105 to $105.50, increasing by $0.50. HX Dong Zhan at $96.20, Dutch Red at $76. The factory's snowy white traded at $102, and Jingming ice traded at $135. 5,800 coins of sugar arrived from Hong Kong on the 28th.

### Coal Indian Coal Rises Again

For Indian bituminous coal, big firms started hoarding again yesterday, and spot goods were exhausted. There were not many old orders, leading the market to cross the $400 mark again, seeing a new high. Calcutta lump was being openly bid at $425, but owners were still reluctant to release their goods. Coal powder traded at $360. Indian lump coal from the street stores was $448 per ton. Only old transactions were being processed, and new customers were not being sold to.

### Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks All Reopened Yesterday. Security at Each Bank Entrance Extremely Strict, Market Rumors Cease and People's Hearts Stabilized

The Shanghai branches of the four national banks, Central, China, Communications, and Farmers, were ordered to reopen uniformly from 9:00 AM yesterday. Since the reopening of the banks yesterday, it has confirmed that the Chinese government is determined to continue to maintain Shanghai's finances regardless of the environment. Therefore, the various unfounded rumors circulating in recent days have been shattered. The details are recorded below:

All Branches Reopen

(1) The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank on Avenue Road was merged into the office on Baker Road for business operations. (2) The Shanghai branch of the Bank of China on Hankou Road, as well as the offices in the Eight Immortals Bridge, Tongfu Road, Jing'an Temple, and Xinzha Road, and the Shanghai offices and liaison offices of the retreated branches in the occupied areas, have all reopened. (3) The Shanghai branch of the Bank of Communications on Mulling Road, as well as the branches on Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Minguo Road, and the Shanghai liaison offices of the branch offices in the Zhen and Zhejiang areas, have fully reopened. (4) The Shanghai branch of the Farmers Bank of China on Avenue Joffre was merged into the office on Edinburgh Road for business operations.

Tight Security Protection by Armed Detectives

During the closure of each bank, safety issues were agreed upon with the concession authorities. Therefore, when each bank reopened yesterday, the police authorities dispatched six to ten armed detectives to guard each bank entrance. Strict inspections and interrogations were carried out on people entering and exiting. American troops were stationed at the entrances of the banks in the American defense zone, and two members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were stationed in the A zone, all with pistols drawn, in a very tense situation. For those opened in the French Concession, many French and Vietnamese military police were also protecting, and armored vehicles were parked at the entrances. Sandbags were also piled up in important locations in each bank and iron gates were built to ensure safety.

50,000 Yuan in Consolation Money for Each Bank Employee Killed

After two deputy directors of the Bank of China were shot and killed in front of the Bank of China villa, the bank authorities deeply mourned their outstanding work performance during their lifetime. It was approved by the Chongqing head office and each was allocated 50,000 yuan in consolation money. Most of the more than 100 households of bank employees residing in the Bank of China villa have moved out. Only a dozen families are still residing there. It is heard that the dormitory has been subleased to the Japanese. The released Bank of China employees who were previously detained have returned to work and are performing their duties as usual.

Restore Collection and Delivery and Maintain the "Four Bottoms"

After the four banks reopened, all notes and drafts within the closure period will be re-registered for collection and delivery on the date of reopening. At the same time, the bank note exchange and the money industry note exchange have resumed the exchange of notes from the four banks. Anyone holding notes from any of the four banks, in addition to being able to withdraw cash from each bank, can also transfer to the bank for transfer. Therefore, legitimate Chinese and foreign businessmen have expressed unlimited excitement about the reopening of the four banks. The fact that the four banks can reopen before the Shanghai financial industry's accounting cutoff on the fourth day from the end of the month will stabilize the entire financial system, allowing various industries to operate flexibly. With the adjustment of the four banks, commercial banks and exchange houses can continue to provide loans, allowing each industry to safely get past this cutoff.

Rumors Cease and Hearts Stabilize

The New Sound News Agency recently learned from the financial market that before the four banks closed, speculators in Shanghai spread rumors and aggressively hoarded foreign exchange and gold in an attempt to make profits. Now that the facts have proven that the four banks have not withdrawn and have reopened, the market rumors have ceased and hearts have stabilized. The black market exchange has been released, and the prices of various commodities have fallen. Therefore, people's livelihoods and social stability have benefited greatly. It is hoped that people in the isolated island will not easily believe unfounded rumors in the future, and will not engage in speculative transactions that violate wartime financial policies. Speculative transactions are not only prohibited by law, but also harm people's livelihoods and affect finances.

Maintain the Stability of the Black Market Foreign Exchange

The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank restored the publication of the equilibrium tax rate and legal foreign exchange rate at 10:00 AM, and handled matters in accordance with the established policy. The British HSBC Bank's black market foreign exchange rate remained stable. The rumor that the black market exchange rate would not be maintained was thus debunked. Regarding the Chinese Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund, since the Sino-American and Sino-British loans were signed, the Stabilization Fund has increased by 110 million yuan, so the statutory exchange rate will be able to be sustained permanently and will not fall. As for the Shanghai black market foreign exchange, in order to take into account the business of local merchants, it will continue to be maintained and managed by the Stabilization Committee.

### American University Students Donate to Promote Aid to China National Fundraising to be Held on May 4th, and Congratulatory Telegram Sent to Chinese Students

The American Student Union, abbreviated as (ASA), to express sympathy for Chinese youth, will promote fundraising to aid China for Chinese students on the 4th of next month, the Chinese Student Movement Memorial Day.

All proceeds from the donation will be sent to China and donated to Chinese youth students. The union plans to send a telegram to Chinese students on that day to express admiration for their spirit of fighting hard to win freedom and equality for the country.

### The Remains of Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan Hold a Casket Closing Ceremony, to be Solemnly Held at 11:00 AM this Morning, Over 40,000 More People Went to Mourn Yesterday

Five days have passed since the martyrdom of Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan, and from morning to night yesterday, the intersection of Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road was crowded with people, like a surging angry tide. Tens of thousands of people went to pay their respects to Xie's remains, with young students being the most numerous, and there were also many people from the business community. This phenomenon not only shows the public's admiration for national heroes, but also may be due to General Xie's sacrifice for benevolence, which has aroused an irresistible enthusiastic tidal wave of millions of people in the isolated island. The funeral committee of Xie's remains has decided to hold a casket closing ceremony at 11:00 AM this morning. It is expected that there will be even more people who go to pay their last respects to Xie. The details of yesterday's situation are recorded below:

Over 40,000 More People Went to Mourn

From 7:00 AM yesterday morning, crowds continuously went to pay their condolences. From 1:00 PM, it became even more crowded. In order to maintain order, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department placed barbed wire into a curved shape at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road, 40 steps away. Another barbed wire fence was erected. Seven or eight western constables and many Chinese constables were directing at the scene. There were also two red police vehicles on standby at the intersection. Students were the most numerous among the crowd, and most went in collective formations. In addition, there were also many workers and Chinese constables. Wreaths, elegiac couplets, and elegiac plaques were raised high in the air. At 5:00 PM, the two barbed wire fences were knocked down, and the Singapore Road street sign was also crushed. The number of people was estimated to be around 40,000. Thanks to the effective maintenance of order by the police, no incidents occurred. After entering the camp, the crowds filed into the auditorium to pay their respects to the remains, and the order was very good. More than 1,000 wreaths, elegiac couplets, etc. were received yesterday.

Casket Closing Ceremony to be Held this Morning

The funeral committee of Xie's remains has decided to hold a casket closing ceremony at 11:00 AM this morning. The program is recorded as follows: (1) All stand in silence, (2) Play music, (3) The officiant takes his place (the officiant is Vice Regiment Commander Lei), (4) Sing the national anthem, (5) Bow three times to the party and national flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, (6) Silent tribute for three minutes, (7) Present flowers and fruits, (8) Play mourning music, (9) Pay respects to the remains (all go around the coffin in turn), (10) Closing the coffin (playing music), (11) Ceremony complete. The band is supplied by the China Women and Children Relief Association and the Orphanage and Training Institute.

Various Suggestions for Making Statues for Commemoration

The Isolated Army Camp has received many suggestions from all walks of life in recent days, among which the most important is the suggestion to cast a bronze statue of Regiment Commander Xie to commemorate him permanently. Xie's glorious history is deeply imprinted in the minds of the people of Shanghai. If there is no statue, how can it express eternal thoughts? However, according to Vice Regiment Commander Lei, we deeply agree with this matter in principle. However, how to proceed will be carefully considered, and we hope that all circles will contribute specific opinions, such as fundraising methods, construction locations, etc., to facilitate the process. In addition, Xie's burial site has been decided to be temporarily in the small garden in front of Xie's bedroom. However, whether it is permanent or temporary will be decided after asking the central government and obtaining the consent of the family. However, some commercial firms have already gone to discuss it, and will send the designs in a few days, which will then be reviewed and selected. Also, there has been no news of Xie's family arriving in Shanghai as of yesterday.

Joint Memorial Service by All Circles in the Provisional Capital

Reuter News Agency, Chongqing, 28th: After Xie Jinyuan, the commander of the Shanghai Isolated Army, was killed, the National Comfort Association and the various groups in the Provisional Capital have decided to hold a joint memorial service on the 10th of next month. All cinemas here today also premiered the film "Eight Hundred Heroes."

### Four Banks Resume Business, Price Limit Removed: Rice Prices Soar Again Yesterday - Speculators Recklessly Hike Prices, Time for Decisive Government Action Is Ripe

Yesterday, the Rice Market Management Committee received an order from Deputy Director Ho De-kui of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and immediately drafted and issued Announcement No. 193 to the market, stating that upon the order of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the China, Communications, Kincheng, and Farmers Banks have resumed business, and financial stability has been achieved. The emergency price limit of the 17th of this month is hereby lifted. From today (yesterday) onwards, merchants and civilians are permitted to determine reasonable market prices in accordance with the economic principles of supply and demand, etc. This is a special public announcement for general knowledge.

Raising Prices by Four or Five Yuan in One Day

Yesterday, after the rice market opened, speculative activities remained rampant. Rice shops had already entered the market, but brokers had not yet appeared. The price of rice was raised by a significant four or five yuan per picul. The highest price for domestic rice reached 140 yuan per picul, and Saigon No. 1 also rose to 138 yuan. In the past week, the price of rice in the city has risen by fifteen or sixteen yuan per picul. If there is no thorough solution, the severity of the food problem will be unimaginable. Therefore, citizens hope that the authorities will take decisive action, set a strict price limit based on the cost of rice in warehouses, regardless of the consequences.

Profit of Forty Yuan Per Picul

It is found that the main reason for the recent rise in rice prices is the hoarding and speculation by large warehouse owners. Rice shops are vying to purchase spot goods, and the general blindly follow suit. The unfounded rumors spread by speculators in the market have a significant impact, fueling the rampant price increases. On the supply side, more than 30,000 bags arrived yesterday, and more than 300 bags of domestic rice arrived in Shanghai. The city's rice reserves are increasing rather than decreasing. It is found that the cost of each picul stored in warehouses and arriving daily is no more than 90 yuan. However, the current selling price has been raised to more than 130 yuan. In an instant, the profit per picul has reached more than 40 yuan. Most warehouse owners are still unwilling to sell off their stocks, and their ulterior motives are self-evident.

Inexpensive Hong Kong Rice Should Be Quickly Shipped to Shanghai

The authorities of the Public Concession previously agreed with the representatives of the Hong Kong authorities in Shanghai that Hong Kong would supply the city with 250,000 bags of foreign rice per month, and the price per picul would be more than 20 yuan lower than the current selling price in Shanghai. Because it was not approved by the miscellaneous grains and bean industry, the authorities planned to sell this cheap rice directly to rice shops to reduce the burden on citizens. According to reporters, this inexpensive rice has not yet arrived in Shanghai, so rice shops are unable to purchase it and can only buy from unscrupulous elements controlling the rice market. Therefore, all sectors deeply hope that the authorities will immediately find a way to ship the rice to Shanghai as soon as possible, so that rice prices can be slightly suppressed to alleviate the difficult lives of ordinary people.

### Associate Manager of China-US Daily News, Wen Tiansheng, Attacked - Shot Four Times, Lung Injury Severe - Still Conscious, Life Not in Danger

Wen Tiansheng, associate manager and advertising director of the China-US Daily News, usually does not concern himself with politics and dedicates himself to his duties. Unexpectedly, at 10:15 yesterday morning, just as he stepped out of his residence on Gordon Road, three thugs suddenly opened fire on him. He was immediately sent to Baolong Hospital. Although his injuries are serious, his life is not in danger. The details are as follows:

Serving as Associate Manager of China-US Daily News

Wen Tiansheng is a native of Jiashan, Zhejiang, and is 36 years old. He graduated from St. John's University in Shanghai. He has served as the associate manager and advertising director of the China-US Daily News for many years, and also served as the director of the business department of the Great Evening News. He has extensive knowledge and experience, and is also amiable and approachable. He usually only knows how to work diligently and be loyal to his duties, and has absolutely no political connections. However, because of his efforts in service, he has received threatening letters several times, and people have inquired by telephone, and some have even visited to inquire. Because he had no grudges with anyone, he dismissed them with a smile and did not reduce his enthusiasm for his career in the slightest. Unexpectedly, he suffered this misfortune.

Shot Four Times in Ambush

Mr. Wen's residence is located at Lane 727 (Dadel Lane), Gordon Road. He usually lives in the office building, but sometimes he goes home to visit his family. At 10:15 yesterday, Mr. Wen got up at home and planned to go to the office to work. Unexpectedly, just as he stepped out of the entrance of Lane 727, two thugs were already lying in ambush there, each with firearms. Seeing him come out, they suddenly took him by surprise, jumped out, and opened fire, firing several shots. Mr. Wen was caught off guard and was hit in four places, including both knees, which were grazed by the same bullet, only injuring the epidermis; one bullet hit his right foot; and one bullet entered from his left lower back, passed through his lung, and went straight up to his right breast. This injury is very serious. After Mr. Wen was hit, he fell to the ground at the entrance of the lane. A Sikh policeman from No. 22 heard the gunshots and caught sight of the fleeing suspects. He drew his gun and chased after them, firing several shots. The thugs also opened fire to resist arrest and eventually escaped. At this time, Mrs. Wen also heard the alarm and rushed out. At the same time, the police received a report and dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate and summoned an ambulance to send Mr. Wen to Baolong Hospital for treatment.

### Reassessment of Real Estate Values - Additional Municipal General Tax - Additional Tax Rates Determined Based on Property Type - Tax Amount to Be Adjusted After Rental Value Is Assessed

The Public Works Department of the Public Concession recently issued a notice to taxpayers regarding the collection of municipal general taxes, stating: "For the purpose of issuing a notice, the report of the Special Committee on the Study of Tax System Inequality, published in the Shanghai Municipal Council's English Gazette on Saturday, January 5, 1941, was approved at the annual meeting of taxpayers on Thursday, April 17, 1941. In accordance with the provisions of the report, tax bills are now being sent, and the main points of the report are briefly described below for the attention of all taxpayers.

Basis for Taxation

(1) Before the rental values of all properties are reassessed, the amount of municipal tax payable for all leased properties shall, from April 1, 1941, be calculated based on the rental value recorded in the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax register on June 30, 1937, which is used to collect taxes, and then increased by the percentage indicated below, depending on the type of property and its location. (2) If the rental value of premises used by owners has been assessed according to the value on June 30, 1937, and then uniformly increased by 20%, the percentage increase should be changed to be handled according to the table below, instead of a general increase of 20%. (3) Before the general reassessment of rental values, the rental value of all houses built, renovated, or added to since June 30, 1937, should be estimated according to the value on that date, plus the percentage indicated below, and the municipal tax payable should be calculated from April 1, 1941, based on the estimated rental value with the added percentage. (4) All owner-occupied premises whose rental value has not been reassessed according to the value on June 30, 1937, should promptly reassess the rental value according to the value on that date, plus the percentage indicated in the table below. Before the rental value has been assessed, the municipal tax should be collected from the owners from April 1, 1941, temporarily based on the municipal tax paid for the premises in the first quarter of the year, plus the corresponding percentage that should be added according to the table below. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council will notify the owners that once the rental value of the premises is assessed or reassessed, the tax amount paid will be adjusted, and the excess will be refunded or the deficiency will be collected.

Percentage Increase

The attached table is as follows: (A) Properties not used for residential purposes: Central District 50%, Western District within and outside the defense line 40%, outside the defense line 20%, Northern District Huishi area 25%, other parts 20%, Eastern District within and outside the boundary 20%. (B) Properties used for residential purposes: Central District 40%, Western District within and outside the defense line 20%, outside the defense line 20%, Northern District Huishi area 20%, other parts taxed according to the rental value assessed according to the 1937 value, Eastern District within and outside the boundary taxed according to the rental value assessed according to the 1937 value.

### Business Representatives Officially Talk with Authorities Yesterday

The business labor dispute was formally discussed at the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday morning by Mr. Xing De, director of the Industrial Section, and Mr. Zhen Gaoyi, who convened the labor representatives at the Shanghai Municipal Council. Five representatives from the factory staff representatives and the distribution office staff association attended. First, Mr. Lu explained the five points raised by the representatives. After discussion, it was considered that the first point was the most important and needed detailed study.

Reasonable Solution Based on Commodity Prices

The mediator is currently asking the employers to compare the salaries from July of last year to March of this year with the commodity price index published by the Shanghai Municipal Council every month, striving for rationalization and seeking a permanent solution to avoid future disputes. The remaining points are easier to resolve. Subsequently, the labor representatives asked the employers whether important personnel of the company in Shanghai were responsible, otherwise negotiations would not be easy to progress quickly and smoothly. Mr. Lu said that he had contacted the employers and planned to complete the negotiations within a short period of time. He also said that the course of the labor dispute was quite good. After a six or seven-day strike, there was no disturbance, which was very admirable. The labor representatives stated that their attitude was that the minimum living rate published by the Shanghai Municipal Council was the standard for this request, and it seemed that there was nothing wrong with it in terms of reason. They hoped that the employers would consider the suffering of the labor and tide over the difficulties together. Otherwise, if the situation expands, the employers should bear full responsibility.

Road Workers Make Demands

The English-language Great American Daily News reported that the Public Works Department of the French Concession recently dismissed 50 garbage workers, and the remaining 1,000 workers went on strike last Saturday and Sunday to protest. The Public Works Department had to hire about 150 White Russians today (28th) to work on cleaning up the garbage. It is reported that their wages are eight yuan per day. The strikers said that 50 workers were dismissed for no reason, causing a labor dispute, and made several demands to the authorities, such as increasing wages, raising rice subsidies, and rehiring the dismissed workers.

Small Newspaper Workers Increase Rice Subsidy

Due to the sharp increase in printing costs, the small newspapers in the city increased the wholesale price by two-fifths from April 1 to maintain operations. Therefore, the printing workers who print small newspapers, with the gradual increase in rice prices and the daily increase in the cost of living, could not maintain their livelihoods with their original wages and jointly requested the employers (printing houses) to increase their wages by 30%. The matter has been discussed several times in meetings between the printing house industry and the small newspaper industry to discuss countermeasures. It is now known that a concrete solution has been reached: each typesetting printing worker will be given an additional rice subsidy of 10 yuan per month by the employers. The workers, in view of the great difficulties faced by the printing houses and small newspapers, also expressed satisfaction with this response in order to achieve cooperative results. The rice subsidy will be calculated from April.

### Famous Artist Wu Nanyu Dies of Illness

The famous artist Wu Nanyu, who specialized in calligraphy and painting, and was especially skilled in carving, could engrave thousands of needle-point small characters on a square-inch ivory plate, which could not be identified without a magnifying glass. The flowers, birds, landscapes, and figures he carved were all lifelike, with the magic of nature and the ingenuity of craftsmanship. He was famous at home and abroad. Unexpectedly, heaven did not grant him long life, and he died of asthma in his hometown of Yangzhou on the 23rd of this month, at the age of only forty-six. Everyone who heard the news mourned and regretted his passing. It is truly a great loss to the Chinese art world.

### Problem of Detained Yugoslav Ship - Can Be Resolved in a Few Days - Port Authorities in Negotiations with Japanese and Italians

The Yugoslav cargo ship "Toni Slav," was still under "protection" by Italian sailors and maritime police yesterday. According to responsible sources, the matter could be resolved in a few days. It is reported that the Jianghai Customs Port Administration, the Italian Consul, and the Japanese naval authorities are still in negotiations. The "Toni Slav" cargo ship is leased by the Yugoslav Shipping Company to transport wheat from Australia. Its Shanghai agent is the British company Jardine Matheson. The ship was still flying the Yugoslav flag yesterday. The Italian authorities insisted that the captain of the ship had voluntarily requested the dispatch of troops to "protect" the ship after Yugoslavia was captured by Nazi forces.

Customs Prevents Italian Action

The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the Jianghai Customs maritime police dispatched a patrol team to guard the Yugoslav cargo ship "Toni Slav" today (28th) to prevent further action by the Italian authorities in this area. At the same time, Italian sailors remained on board. Although the ship was under the "protection" of Italian sailors, it was still flying the Yugoslav flag.

Can Be Resolved in Two or Three Days

It is generally believed that after the Japanese naval authorities and the Japanese consular authorities protested and the Customs authorities negotiated with the Italian authorities, the Italian sailors can be removed in the next few days. A Japanese naval spokesman announced this morning that all issues related to this matter will be almost completely resolved, but he could not say when the Italian sailors would withdraw. Customs officials also said this morning that the case would be resolved within the next two or three days.

The Japanese naval authorities continued to take measures to ensure safety in other public places in the area. It is reported that the bombing of the Rongguang and Donghe cinemas on the 16th injured about 20 people and killed several people.

The Japanese authorities are now intensifying their search in the Hongkou area, and a large number of Japanese residents who have joined the security corps are assisting in the operation.

Japanese Residents Assist in the Search

The plan was for Japanese residents to be divided into small teams and stationed in shifts at various intersections in the Hongkou district designated by the Japanese Marines authorities to observe the situation. It was not stated whether these security corps would assist Japanese Marines and military police in searching houses and pedestrians. The spokesman also said that the Japanese Marines and military police, in cooperation, would soon implement strict measures, the nature of which could not be disclosed. What could be said was that searches would be carried out throughout the Hongkou area in order to find the weapons used by the perpetrators of the bombing.

### Returning from the Soup Kitchen (1)

— Liu

Rice is expensive, fuel is expensive, and all daily necessities are expensive. They are so expensive that some people are clapping their hands and celebrating, while countless others are drooping their heads and losing their spirits.

One does not know the value of rice until one is hungry. Therefore, it is best not to talk about the high price of rice to those who have rice to eat. Although rice is expensive, it is still much cheaper than candy that costs more than ten yuan per pound and Florida tangerines that cost one yuan. Those who have 10,000 or 8,000 bags of rice in their hands are still craning their necks and hoping for the price of rice to rise!

Only when one sees people struggling on the edge of starvation does one realize that rice is truly a life-sustaining soup, "get it and live, don't get it and die," there is no room for forcing it. Therefore, the rice that is usually taken for granted, having rice to eat, one still needs delicacies; having delicacies, one still dislikes the taste. If one's life declines directly to the level of ordinary life, if one has a sense of remorse, one will deeply regret the extravagance and waste of the past, and realize that the use of rice is much greater and more precious than all rare and exotic foods. A certain prime minister of the Ming Dynasty, extremely extravagant and luxurious, had snow-white and fat rice residue flowing from the sewer into the temple next to his mansion every day. The monks in the temple saw it and cherished it, picked it up from the sewage, washed it clean, dried it in the sun, and stored it for food. When the prime minister failed and his property was confiscated, he rented a house in the temple next to his mansion. The monks served him white rice, which he found very delicious. He told the monks, and the monks said, "This is from your house," and told him the reason. The prime minister was ashamed and regretted it to the extreme. Seeing this situation, I would like to ask those who have rice to eat and do not care about those who do not have rice to eat to cherish their blessings and quickly create blessings, and not only care about the current pleasure of the mouth, but also care about the future blessings, which is the perfect blessing!

I am also one of those struggling in the current difficult life; but I often comfort myself, although I am not as good as the top, I am more than enough than the bottom, but if prices continue to rise so high, our lives will inevitably decline from the usual most frugal level to below or the lowest level one day. But after visiting the soup kitchen, seeing the people eating porridge, I couldn't help but feel infinite emotion, and I didn't feel infinite comfort in my personal life.

I always feel that doing charity requires not only hard work but also bearing complaints, and it also requires a bit of spirit to have a percentage of effectiveness. I usually deeply admire the old charitable organizations for their good intentions and good intentions, but in terms of handling affairs and organization, they are inevitably inferior to the undertakings of public and Christian religions due to various relationships and making do with what is available. I like to visit various relief undertakings as research materials, because I believe that to treat social diseases, one must first understand the cause of the disease and the methods of treatment throughout history. But I never like to flatter people, nor do I like to be demanding. I know that "doing charity is difficult", "criticizing is easy, doing things is difficult", but since I returned from the soup kitchen yesterday, I can't help but feel that the current charitable organizations have made progress in all aspects, and it is indeed time to look at them with new eyes.

### Drugs Found in Abbot's Room

Huabu No. 329 of the Gordon Road Police Station saw a man holding a bar of cocoa-flavored cigarettes at 6:50 the day before yesterday. His behavior was suspicious, so he stepped forward to search him. He found a package of opium dross in the box and took it to the police station. After questioning by Detective Tao Afu, he learned that his name was Lu Jinbao, 39 years old, from Shanghai. According to his confession, the opium dross was entrusted by Yun Zhao, the abbot of the Baoben Hall Temple in Changsha, to be delivered to a certain Jia in the Yinhua Lane, Xiaoshadu Road for collection. He said that he had delivered the soil three times before and after. According to the confession, the detectives went to Baoben Hall to arrest Yun Zhao, but he had already escaped after hearing the news. Only three opium pipes, six large cans of opium dross, eight small cans, seven bags of heroin, and two bags of ashes were found in Yun Zhao's room and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, Lu Jinbao was escorted to Criminal Court No. 3 of the Special Court. Chiang Baolian, the police lawyer, explained the process, saying that the accomplice, the monk Yun Zhao, had not yet been arrested, so he requested permission to postpone the trial. After questioning by Judge Huang Risheng, he was ordered to be detained and retried on a later date. The seized soil was detained for safekeeping.

### Accumulation of Thefts Near the Great World; "Little Ningbo" Arrested

Xu Jinbao from Ningbo, nicknamed "Little Ningbo," 26 years old, was the leader of a gang of robbers. He resided at the Xiao Ke Inn, No. 12 Pi Shao Nai Road, outside the Little North Gate. Daily, he instigated his gang to rob gold bracelets and wristwatches from women and felt hats and clothing from men passing through the area from the Great World southward to Nanyang Bridge. The gang members handed over the stolen goods to Xu for pawn or sale, and he divided the proceeds. Xu thus reaped the benefits of a fisherman, leading a comfortable life, much like a shop owner. Detectives Gao Meiyan and Wang Dong and Detective Li Yuyuan of the French Concession Police learned of this and arrested Xu the other night. They also retrieved wristwatches, clothing, gold ornaments, and other items from various pawnshops and brought them back to the police station. They are awaiting further arrests of his fugitive gang members to prosecute them together.

### Owner of Dehe Pharmacy, Gao Zhiyun, Assassinated; Shot Twice at the Intersection of Yunnan Road and Died

Gao Zhiyun, a native of Suzhou, 60 years old, owned the Dehe Pharmacy at No. 682, Intersection of Duoya Road and Yunnan Road. The business was doing reasonably well. Yesterday, around noon, three friends of Gao came to the pharmacy and invited him out for lunch. Gao, feeling he couldn't leave the counter unattended, went out with them. They walked slowly westward along the road. As they were talking and laughing in front of the Hot Spring Bath House newsstand at the intersection of Yunnan Road, suddenly a black-clad assailant emerged from the roadside, drew a pistol, and fired two shots at Gao. One bullet hit his foot, and the other hit his back and pierced through to his chest. Gao bled profusely and fell to the ground immediately. The assailant, seeing his purpose fulfilled, fled into the crowd on Yunnan Road. The patrol officer on duty at the intersection of Edward Avenue and Yunnan Road rushed to the scene, but the assailant had vanished without a trace. An ambulance was called to take Gao to the Guangji Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of his injuries, he had already died by the time the ambulance arrived at the hospital. The three friends quickly returned to the store to report the situation and then abruptly left. During the war, Gao served as the first captain of the South City Citizens' Self-Defense Force when it was organized. After the National Army moved westward, Gao focused solely on business and did not involve himself in external affairs. His sudden death is perplexing. Gao is survived by his hungry wife, Mrs. Zhang, and a young son (currently studying at a certain primary school), leaving them in dire straits.

### National Universities Establish Application Centers in Hong Kong; Everything Handled According to the 29th Year

(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Ministry of Education announced the cessation of unified enrollment for public universities in the 30th year. This year, each public university should handle its own enrollment regarding the unified examination system. All enrollment examination procedures have now been clearly stipulated by the Ministry of Education, instructing all universities and colleges to follow them. However, some young people concerned about the unified examination are worried that their chances of entering higher education will be affected after its cancellation. It is now learned that each university will establish application centers in Hong Kong to facilitate applications from overseas Chinese students and handle everything according to the 29th year. Since overseas transportation routes have changed, the Student's Friends Society in Chongqing has compiled and printed updated routes and notified overseas Chinese students.

It is also learned that Sun Yat-sen University will establish a recruitment office in Hong Kong to recruit outstanding talents from Hong Kong and Macau. Peking Yenching University is scheduled to hold entrance examinations for guaranteed admission on the 9th and 10th of next month. Outstanding students from secondary schools recognized by the university can apply to participate in the examination. The fifth district, which is the Hong Kong and Macau district, has entrusted Pui Ying Middle School to handle the guaranteed admission examination.

### Ministry of Education Improves Overseas Chinese Education; Actively Selects Teachers; Sends Orders to Hong Kong to Report Required Number of Personnel

(Hong Kong Correspondence) In order to improve overseas Chinese schools, the Ministry of Education intends to select outstanding domestic teachers to serve overseas. Overseas Chinese schools have been specially ordered to report the required number of teachers. Overseas Chinese schools here have successively received this order, which states, "Upon investigation, overseas Chinese schools often lack teachers, and many teaching positions remain vacant, making it difficult to hire qualified personnel to fill them. Meanwhile, teachers trained domestically for overseas Chinese schools have no outlet. Under these circumstances of mismatch between teacher supply and demand, it is difficult to accelerate the progress of overseas Chinese school improvement. Hereafter, each overseas Chinese school should report the required number of teachers, subjects, teaching hours, salary, and the travel expenses the school can bear to the Ministry for the selection of excellent teachers to be sent to teach overseas. Please comply with this order."

### The Tonghui School Strike Takes a Sharp Turn; Resumption of Classes Scheduled for Today

The Tonghui Primary School strike, which has lasted four days, took a sudden sharp turn yesterday. The faculty has decided to resume classes today, ending the turmoil. People in the community are rejoicing. The reporter from Dahuashe has compiled the details as follows:

The Entire Faculty

Earlier yesterday morning, the unfortunate incident had not seen any development. However, personnel related to education strongly urged the faculty to consider the big picture and quickly resume classes via telephone. Gu Chuan-ying, the faculty representative of the school, revealed the intention to resume classes and said that preparations were actively underway. They no longer insisted on the removal of the principal. Jiang Zong-pan, the chairman of the school board, had already accepted the principles of the faculty's demands during the previous day's discussion and had no intention of refusing. However, he believed that all matters must be discussed in detail before concrete solutions could be reached, so he hoped that classes could be resumed first and then a resolution could be sought. Therefore, the opinions of both sides did not differ greatly, and the faculty deeply understood the importance of the matter. Once they changed their minds, everything was easily resolved.

Resumption of Classes in Normal Condition Today

Late yesterday evening, the faculty on strike, after collective discussion, believed that people in the community, the media, and the educational administrative authorities were all earnestly urging them to resume classes. The school board had also clearly indicated that, in addition to the investigation of the corruption case, which had already been thoroughly investigated, and the issue of the principal's removal, which was no longer to be discussed, everything else could be discussed at length. Therefore, they resolutely decided to resume classes immediately. People in the community, hearing this news, were pleased that the faculty could prioritize the overall situation and not just argue over emotions, that the school board members had taken appropriate measures, and that the administrative authorities had effectively mediated. It is also learned that Principal Tang Guoxun will also return to school today to resume his duties as usual. The school board and administrative authorities will also send personnel to express their concern. (Dahuashe)

### Shan Kun Cup Small Ball Performance Match; Fu Lai Defeats Mixed Team

The Shan Kun Cup Charity Small Ball Tournament concluded the day before yesterday. When Samsung and Wenbin competed to the intermission, the match ball was auctioned off on the spot. Zhong Wenji, the deputy manager of the good old Times Foreign Company, purchased it for 300 yuan, the highest price. The benevolent gesture is admirable. The match ball was signed by movie star Chen Yanyan. All ticket revenue from that day will be handled by personnel sent by the Refugee Orphanage. Detailed accounts will be announced within days. Also, according to Wei Shigeng, the host of the match, yesterday's news was slightly inaccurate. The performance match had Xu Shi-lai defeating the mixed team 2-1, not the mixed team defeating Shi-lai.

### Light

— Wu Dai

Recently, the German authorities, in order to investigate the luminosity and projection distance of various lights during blackout, specially conducted various experiments by scientists. The results revealed that a burning match can be seen from half a mile away, a street lamp can be seen from one and a quarter miles away, and indoor light shining through a window can be seen from twelve and a half miles away. Therefore, on blackout nights to guard against air raids, even a tiny spark is significant.

A mere matchstick, something smokers burn in seconds, hardly anybody would have expected that it can shine as far as half a mile away in the dark.

Therefore, a tiny spark, if not handled properly, can cause a great disaster.

On the other hand, a tiny spark can also be a guiding light for travelers in the dark. This immediately made me think of elementary and secondary school teachers who are living the hardest lives in today's society. They are emitting small points of light in the darkness. In the deep night, this is not entirely in vain.

### Tactics in Nature

— Jian Nong

Since "struggle for life" is the biggest argument of evolutionism, it is also a universal phenomenon in nature. Therefore, every species has its own special tactics. Now, let's not talk about the plain ant "trench warfare," the weasel catching chicken "ambush warfare,"... nor use "the eagle preys on the birds" as a metaphor for "air combat," but pick a few things that ordinary people don't pay attention to to talk about.

Nerve Warfare

According to the great scientist Thomson's statement: weak organisms use mimicry or camouflage to avoid attracting the attention of enemies; while powerful or highly poisonous things, on the other hand, exaggerate and flaunt their physique, colorful patterns, etc., to show their fearlessness, so as to make enemies panic and tremble, achieving their own purpose of winning without fighting. For example, those venomous snakes and pythons with splendid scales and all five colors are excellent examples. This means of displaying troops and showing off force and intimidating with empty threats can be called nerve warfare.

Evading Air Raids

The peanut blooms on the ground and is fertilized on the ground, but in order to caress and protect its precious seeds, it must let them deeply burrow into the underground layer: if we interpret this with the biggest rule in biology, "teleology," isn't this very obviously to avoid the air raids of those gluttonous birds? As for all other tuber or root plants, can they also be measured in this way?

Setting Traps

For a plant to want to eat an animal, for something that cannot move to want to eat something that can fly and leap! Then, what other good way is there than to use sweet bait to lure the enemy into one's own trap? The Venus flytrap has leaves covered with thorns on the edge of its fan, but as soon as that unlucky insect falls into the area, it immediately snaps shut with interlocking teeth, making it truly impossible for them to fly! The pitcher plant opens its lidded "jar" that is half-filled with clear water, and the cobra lily opens its "bottle" with dense inward-pointing hairs that are full of mucus: as long as greedy, reckless things come to patronize their nectar, well, one slip and you slide into the inside, immediately there is a lid to cover, and hairs to block, this is called able to get in but unable to get out!

Posting Sentries

Deer, we know, are animals that like to live in groups and lead a collective life. They gallop and roam together during the day, and rest and sleep together at night, but when they are sleeping, there must be one or two night watchmen patrolling and watching near everyone to prevent the enemy from raiding and plundering the camp. If there is a bit of wind or grass movement and the situation is suspicious, they will hiss and call out to alert all of their companions. Isn't this exactly like the sentries we post when we humans are marching?

Commander-in-Chief

The herds of elephants in tropical Africa give us a very clear impression of battle formation. When they forage or rush to the water source in groups, they are always led by the oldest and most experienced elephant, and the rest follow closely in a single line. The leading elephant often holds its nose high in the air: the rest follow with their eyes fixed on its "trunk"! Even when encountering enemies, whether charging or retreating, it is all directed by that raised nose: what else is this but a commander-in-chief?

### Hens' Teeth Not Rare

— Song Cheng

Recently, a household in Wusong Town raised a rooster that suddenly laid eggs, and this news spread as a marvel. In fact, according to biology, it is not surprising at all.

Why is there a distinction between male and female? Regarding this question, many biologists have used many methods and done many years of research. One type of research is done with microscopes. The results of this research found that it is related to a special chromosome in the cell - the sex chromosome (Sex Chromosome). However, sometimes an abnormal state of half-female and half-male is produced, called intersex. The reproductive organs and secondary sexual characteristics of intersex organisms are somewhat like female and somewhat like male. Why do organisms have this intersexuality? To give a biological explanation: every organism's body has two tendencies, one is to develop towards femaleness, and one is to develop towards maleness. If maleness is stronger, it becomes male. If femaleness is stronger, it becomes female. If the developmental forces of femaleness and maleness are equal, this organism will exhibit intersexuality.

If the strength of the male and female forces in the body changes, and the original stronger force becomes weaker, the sexuality of this organism seems to be able to be reversed. Recently, many species of animals have been discovered that can indeed change from female to male, or from male to female. This type of phenomenon is called sex-reversal. Someone experimented: after castrating a rooster, the male-style comb, wattles, and feathers cannot fully develop; after castrating a hen, the nature of a rooster can be expressed instead. A hen crowing in the morning is an abnormal thing, and it is also a very common thing to see. Someone carefully investigated this phenomenon and found that a hen, after laying eggs and hatching chicks, had her ovaries destroyed by tumors, and then gradually grew testicles, emitted rooster-style crowing, showed rooster-style combs and wattles, changed into rooster-style feathers, and, most notably, could mate with hens. This is clear evidence.

Now, the news of a rooster laying eggs is the opposite of the above example, and this rooster is tending towards femaleness. The rooster's testicles have probably been destroyed, and ovaries have grown, and it has laid eggs. This is undoubtedly a sex-reversal phenomenon, and it is definitely not an ominous sign.

Human Affairs

### Humans Eating Humans

— Zuo You

Primitive peoples often killed and cooked the old and weak people in their tribes to fill their hunger due to lack of food. However, in addition to being forced by hunger to cannibalize each other, there are also some barbaric peoples who engage in the cruel act of eating people for various different reasons.

In the wilderness of Africa, as well as in the islands of the South Seas and the Pacific, there are many merciless natives who are very fond of eating human flesh. It is said that these natives feel that no animal meat is as palatable as human flesh, so whenever they capture an enemy or traveler, they salivate and desire to eat him, and will not give up until they kill and devour him. In the Mexican region of America, there is also a type of native who actually treats the captives they catch as livestock. Every time they return from war, they carefully select the enemies they have captured, and kill and cook the fat captives first, using them as a grand feast at their victory banquet. As for the remaining thin captives, they are fed and fattened, and then killed again after their bodies have become fat.

In Sumatra, there is a semi-civilized tribe that believes that after people die, they will run to a very happy paradise; however, before reaching paradise, they must first pass through a very dangerous and narrow single-plank bridge. Below the single-plank bridge, there is a ten-thousand-foot abyss, and elderly and weak people who walk on the bridge will accidentally lose their footing and fall down, never being able to enter that paradise. Therefore, the filial children and grandchildren in this tribe, in order to enable their parents to pass smoothly through that narrow single-plank bridge after their death, will kill and cook them before their parents become too old. When these filial children and grandchildren are eating their own elders, they must also hold a grand ceremony. They first invite all their relatives and friends to observe the ceremony, and then send their elderly parents to a tree. Then everyone gathers under the tree to dance and sing. After singing for a while, several people shake the tree trunk with all their strength. The elderly people climbing on the tree cannot support themselves and fall from above. Then everyone rushes up and cuts the half-dead elderly people into two sections with knives. One section is cooked and shared with the guests, and the other section is thrown into the wilderness, allowing birds and beasts to peck at it.

A good-fighting tribe of red people in northern America likes to cook and eat human hearts. They believe that after eating human hearts, they will increase their courage in battle, so every time they kill a person, they must dig out this person's heart and liver, roast them over a fire, cut them into thin slices, and distribute them to the warriors to enjoy.

In addition, there is also a black people tribe in the interior of Africa that often kills criminals and then distributes the meat of the dead to everyone to cook and eat, but they usually do not eat human flesh.

In the past, the uncivilized tribes in the border of our country also had the behavior of eating human flesh. The upper reaches of the Jinsha River contain many silver mines, and the Golog people in that area make a living by mining silver. However, their mining technology is quite rudimentary, so they often get very little silver. The Golog people then believe that this is because the local Han people have angered the god of the mine, so whenever they see a Han person, they try to capture him, kill him to worship the god of the mine, and then share the skin and flesh of the dead.

(7) A Cross Scratched on the Face

Both Chief Garrison Officer Yuan and his nephew were gone. A young servant was watering flowers in the courtyard. Upon seeing Qiu Haitang enter, he dropped the watering can and rushed anxiously into the inner room.

Qiu Haitang took off his long coat and sat bored on a rosewood swivel chair, constantly thinking about his sick daughter.

This room was very close to Ai Bao Fan's main house. Although Qiu Haitang had never been there, he deduced that Xiangqi's bedroom must be at most a row of houses away.

He had been sitting for less than a minute when he seemed to hear many people's voices inside, a chaotic uproar, as if someone was shouting loudly, and others were crying. Boards were stomping deafeningly, mixed with the cries of a small child who was extremely frightened, as if a full-blown martial arts play was being staged in the room at the back of the building.

Qiu Haitang's heart began to pound, but even when he stood at the window, he couldn't hear Xiangqi's voice.

Suddenly, the young servant who had rushed in earlier came out again, but he no longer watered the flowers. Instead, he sat silently on the stone steps, turning his head to look at Qiu Haitang every now and then, with an extremely suspicious expression.

"What's going on inside, causing such an uproar?" Qiu Haitang couldn't help but ask him first.

"Nothing much," the young servant said with an embarrassed look. "Please sit for a while, the Commander will be out soon."

Qiu Haitang was trying to calm his mind when he suddenly heard a scream from inside, followed by a thud, making the voices even more chaotic. That scream was so shrill and high-pitched that he immediately knew it came from a woman's throat. Although he had never heard Xiangqi scream like that, he couldn't be sure it was her, but who else inside would dare to scream like that? (93)

### The Lucky Me "Charlie"

— Shen Fu

Mention Charlie McCarthy, and a natural smile is bound to appear on the lips of movie fans. That strangely shaped wooden kid, speaking in an old-fashioned, playful manner, makes people laugh with every move.

There are many detailed reports about the activities of many Hollywood stars, scattered throughout newspapers and magazines. Here, the author introduces a bit about Charlie McCarthy, hoping to be welcomed by readers.

Body and Appearance—Charlie McCarthy's agile body is thirty-eight inches tall and weighs forty pounds. In addition to his original head, Charlie has several substitute heads and five or six bodies. The original head was carved by a manager named Mike in a Chicago bar and sold to Edgar Bergen—Charlie's owner, Charlie's soul, that guy whose hair is slicked back and who is inseparable from Charlie, is thirty-seven years old this year, a Chicago native, Charlie has rosy cheeks and messy, coarse red hair. His face has a unique quality that cannot be replicated. When broadcasting on the radio, he is covered with cellophane (transparent paper) to prevent his skin from being damaged by the wind. Bergen tried to carve several others in the same style, but failed many times. So, he had to insure Charlie for $5,000. When Charlie travels, he must buy a full ticket because the insurance company requires him to occupy a compartment so he can be locked inside. A few years ago in New York, one of his substitutes was kidnapped, causing a national uproar. But Bergen himself knew that the real Charlie was safely hidden in a vault at a bank in Hollywood.

A Glimpse of Reputation—Charlie recently went to New York to broadcast, and 60,000 people requested tickets to visit the broadcasting studio. When he got off the train at Grand Central Station, many photographers held their cameras high above their heads, squeezed through the crowd, and shouted, "Tell that guy to move aside!" That "guy" was Bergen. There was a Charlie McCarthy Day at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco and the New York World's Fair. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Charlie with a wooden Oscar statuette.

Income Overview—Charlie's income is five times that of President Roosevelt. Just for using his name as a trademark for alarm clocks, shirts, dolls, and many small toys, he is paid $100,000 each year.

### Liu Tianhong Has Elegant Tastes

— Mei Zhuang

Mr. Liu Shuyi, art name Tianhong, comes from a prominent family in Hunan Province (Governor-General Liu Kunyi is his uncle). Because of his love for opera, he became a performer. Mr. Liu is exceptionally talented, surpassing ordinary children. At the age of five or six, he was already able to perform on stage, and at the age of eight, he was already performing as the leading actor at the Gong Wu Tai. His performance in the opera "Crying at the Ancestral Temple" was highly praised by opera enthusiasts and is still admired today. In the spring of 1927, Mr. Liu left Shanghai and went north to study under Mr. Yu Shuyan. After three years of diligent study, his art had reached a high level of accomplishment. He occasionally performed in the old capital (often collaborating with Xun Huisheng), and his reputation was excellent. Newspapers unanimously praised his art, saying that Mr. Liu's artistry was superior to others in its elegance and refinement. Operas such as "Zhan Taiping," "Zhuliangzhai," and "Wenqiao Naofu" were deeply imbued with Yu Shuyan's authentic style. From these few words, one can see the extent of Mr. Liu's achievement. Later, due to a failing voice, he angrily changed his profession. However, in his spare time, he still could not forget his passion for vocal music. Singing loudly, he still retained the charm of his former performances. Famous amateur singers such as E Lügong, Xiao Shui, and Sun Yangnong all praised him, saying that Mr. Shuyan was the only one who understood the "rhyme" of singing opera, other than Mr. Liu. Recently, the Golden Stage authorities invited Mr. Liu to make a guest appearance, and Lügong especially encouraged him. Mr. Liu jumped up and said, "Living in seclusion is boring, and I feel lonely. Trying out my voice would be a great pleasure." Therefore, without hesitation, he readily agreed. Pure and refined music, playing ancient tunes alone. I know that those who admire Mr. Liu's reputation but have not heard him sing will be excited to hear this news and listen to his elegant performance with great pleasure.

### A Few Words on "Cao Cao Captured and Released"

— Ruo Shui

Recently, whether in the South or the North, almost every "Tan-style Lao Sheng" often stages the opera "Cao Cao Captured and Released." The entire opera "Cao Cao Captured and Released" is divided into four acts: the Courtroom, the Road, Killing Lü, and the Inn. Currently, most performances only include the Road, Killing Lü, and Inn acts, and some even only perform the Road and Killing Lü acts, omitting the beginning and end, the Courtroom and Inn. Since Cao Cao is neither "captured" nor "released," this greatly contradicts the title and plot of the play. The sin of laziness is difficult to tolerate in the rules of opera.

Those who perform "Cao Cao Captured and Released" today, such as Yan Jupeng, Tan Fuying, Yang Zisen, Xi Xiaobo, and Zhou Xiaotian, all achieve good results, with Tan Fuying and Yang Baosen performing the best. Yan Jupeng's voice narrowed and his singing became strange in his later years, so he is not considered.

The difficulty of "Captured and Released" lies not in the heavy singing, but in the fact that it goes from Xipi to Erhuang. Erhuang is deep and mellow, with an aged tone, which is not suitable for those with poor voices, because it involves many low notes. Xipi is more fluent and high-pitched, and can be assisted by falsetto, and long interludes can be used for rest, because the interlude of Xipi is longer than that of Erhuang. Therefore, it is easier to sing Xipi before Erhuang, but if one sings Erhuang after Xipi, there are few who do not become hoarse. Moreover, three Erhuang sections follow one after another, with each section more intense than the last, leaving no room for rest. Therefore, those whose voices are not solid and whose breath is not sufficient dare not sing "Cao Cao Captured and Released" lightly. However, those who perform "Cao Cao Captured and Released" today only perform the Road and Killing Lü acts, avoiding difficulties and being lazy, and their faults cannot be excused.

In the past, Gui Fen and Tan Xinpei were both famous for this opera, which can be called a masterpiece. In addition, the Kui-style Lao Sheng Shuang Kuoting was also good at it, with a unique style. After Tan's death, there were very few followers of Gui Fen, with Wang Fengqing being the closest, with a hint of Wang's sad and passionate spirit. There were many performers of this opera in the Tan school, but none were as refined and tasteful as Luo Xiaobao. Now that Luo has passed away, and Yu Shuyan's voice is too thin, the remaining ones such as Tan Fuying and Yang Baosen are still passable, but they are far from their predecessors.

Chapter Seven: Why Are Attacks on Cities and Killing Generals So Turbulent?

At this time, Li Xin's circumstances had changed, and his mentality had also changed accordingly. On the one hand, he admired Hong Niangzi's charm, and on the other hand, he was grateful for Hong Niangzi's rescue. He stepped forward and bowed deeply to Hong Niangzi, saying: "All my past actions were wrong, I beg your forgiveness. I am deeply grateful for your selfless rescue yesterday, and I will never forget your great kindness." Hong Niangzi turned her head and smiled, saying: "Do you only now realize my sincere intentions? You are such a heartless person! I treated you with all my heart, with tenderness and affection, to win your favor. Who knew that you would betray me and run away, not even looking back? Isn't your heart too hard? Ever since you went down the mountain, I have been very worried and immediately sent scouts to Qixian to inquire about news. It was only when the scouts returned that I learned that you had been framed by the magistrate of Qixian and imprisoned. This is you walking into the trap yourself. I originally wanted to come and save you, this ungrateful and heartless person, but I thought that although you were indifferent and unkind to me, you still had no malice, otherwise you could have abandoned me and killed me to report your merits. But you were unwilling to harm me, you are still not ungrateful or unjust. Moreover, you were imprisoned because of me. If I don't come to save you, who else will save you? Therefore, after discussing it with my brother, we decided to go down the mountain to rescue you. I and twenty of my men and children disguised ourselves and infiltrated the city to rob the prison first. My brother led a large force to attack the city afterward, acting in two groups. Now I am happy to have rescued you, and your hatred has been avenged. We have come to Qing Shi Mountain again. From now on, will your heart still waver and change? Do you still dislike me for being a female bandit and are unwilling to marry me?" When Hong Niangzi said this, Li Xin had already grasped her soft hand and said: "I dare not, I dare not. I now recognize you as a heroine among women, a paragon of chivalry, how dare I treat you like a bandit again? I fully accept your love. Moreover, I have nowhere to go. Don't worry. I will never have any other intentions again. I sincerely wish to marry you and grow old together. Heaven and the sun are above, I, Li Xin, vow to be a loyal subject. Don't worry." (50)
