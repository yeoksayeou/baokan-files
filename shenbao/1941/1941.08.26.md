### British Prime Minister Churchill Announces US-Japan Negotiations Underway; If Peace Fails, They Will Jointly Curb Threats; Also Strive for Liberation of Occupied Areas in Europe

United Press International, London, 25th – Prime Minister Churchill warned last night that Japan is an aggressor in the Far East and should quickly submit, otherwise, it should receive the full strength of Britain and the United States. Mr. Churchill also declared that after defeating Hitlerism and seizing the weapons of aggressive nations, Britain and the United States intend to become the armed "police" of the world. The British wartime leader broke his silence regarding the historic maritime conference with President Roosevelt, openly declaring that he and the US President had made a solemn oath to jointly crush Nazism, and stated that this oath "should be fulfilled and must be fulfilled." The Prime Minister, in a half-hour broadcast address to the world, raised the question asked by the British people, namely, how close is the country to war? He declared that the US Navy had saved the Western Hemisphere from Hitler's rule, stating "God sees," President Roosevelt began to reorganize the strength of the US Navy eight years ago. Churchill, when warning Japan, spoke with a threatening tone, without any politeness.

Reuters, London, 25th – British Prime Minister Churchill, in a broadcast to the world last night, disclosed that the United States is currently, with infinite patience, seeking a fair and peaceful solution, giving the greatest guarantee to Japan's legitimate interests, and said that we hope these negotiations can be successful. If they ultimately fail, then we will naturally, without hesitation, rally to the side of the United States. Japanese warlords, attempting to imitate the styles of Hitler and Mussolini, have invaded China and devastated its 500 million people for five years now. The Japanese army, moreover, threatens Singapore and the Philippines with its actions. Such actions must be stopped. All efforts will be made to achieve a peaceful resolution.

Regarding the Eastern Front, Churchill said that about 1.5 to 2 million Nazi cannon fodder have consumed the dust of the endless Russian plains. British officers inspecting the Soviet front lines have reported their admiration for the efficiency of its military organization and its well-equipped forces.

Churchill, speaking of the British and American guarantee to destroy the Nazi dictatorship, said that many feasible measures to achieve this goal are already being arranged and implemented. We will do our utmost to overcome all difficulties to deliver supplies to the Soviet Union, without allowing any obstacles. Residents of the occupied areas of Europe should all hold hope, assistance is coming. A large army is now being formed for them. Liberation is certain.

### The Maritime Conference Has a Major Mission; Symbolizes the Profound Unity of Britain and America

The original text of the British Prime Minister's broadcast first mentioned his maritime conference with President Roosevelt, saying: "I think the audience will certainly wish me to state the circumstances of my crossing the ocean to meet the beautiful President, where the meeting was held, which is confidential. But I may say that it was held somewhere in the Atlantic. Our party traveled on the latest British battleship, HMS Prince of Wales, escorted by British and Canadian destroyers, directly to the meeting place. I spent three days with my comrade Roosevelt, and British and American naval and military officers were also in continuous consultation. President Roosevelt has been elected three times as the leader of the world's strongest country. I am the servant of the British King and Parliament, and I am now responsible for guiding national affairs in these troubled times, and my duty is also to ensure that what I say and do in administration can be supported by the entire British Empire. Therefore, this meeting must be important, because the two major groups of humanity in the world, namely the British Empire and the United States, speak the same language, embrace the same ideas, and have all the great power that contributes to human progress, only part of which is currently mobilized, and is still being mobilized one after another. Therefore, this meeting is symbolic, and its main importance lies in this, because what it symbolizes is that in any place and at any time, in a form that everyone can understand, it always arouses the profound unity of the English-speaking people of the world in times of emergency. I say that what it symbolizes is even more important than this, namely, the gathering of the forces of good in the world to resist the terrible forces of evil that permeate all of Europe and a large part of Asia. I do not speak these words lightly. This is an unprecedented gathering in history, representing the English-speaking people undertaking the guiding work of the happiness of the people of all continents during a period of hardship and turmoil, and making selfless and loyal efforts to guide the world out of worry and into the great road of freedom and justice. This is truly the most noble and glorious opportunity that any part of humanity can have. All those who see all kinds of extraordinary and terrible things, fiercely like a raging tide, impacting humanity, even if they are extreme skeptics, must feel that we each have the opportunity to devote ourselves and fulfill our duties in a grand plan whose results cannot be reversed."

### Sternly Condemns the Nazi Trampling of All of Europe and Praises the Brave Fighting of the Soviet Army

Recently, terrible things have followed one after another, namely, the Nazi iron hoof has trampled on all of Europe. The most vicious weapons of war and science, combined with the most miserable performance of cunning evil, have become an unprecedented tool of aggression. All human rights, customs, characteristics, and the structures passed down by many ancient countries and ancient peoples, are all subject to it: Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece, Croatia, and Serbia, especially France, have all been poisoned. And Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria have become accomplices and brought shame upon themselves. But the true status of these countries is not much different from that of the occupied territories. Sweden, Spain, and Turkey are now all alarmed and do not know which country will be victimized next. The most famous countries and nations in Europe are now all thrown into the abyss, and without assistance, they will never be able to extricate themselves. But Hitler still does not consider himself satisfied. He previously concluded a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union – the same as with Turkey – in order to keep the Soviet Union unprepared, waiting for his attack. But nine weeks ago today, Hitler suddenly launched a surprise attack, with millions of troops and their sharp weapons, wreaking havoc on what he called an ally, with the aim of crushing the Soviet Union. These terrible things are unfolding before our eyes every day, with the selfish desire to control the world, putting two or three million or more people to death. What else is he but a demon? "Lead forward, destroy the Soviet Union" – this is the demon's command. Thus, from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, six or seven million soldiers have entered the death struggle. Alas, this invasion is not easy, and not into uninhabited territory. The Soviet people, united as one, rose up to defend their country. The Nazis bled for the first time for a thousand miles. Nearly two million Nazi cannon fodder have been buried in the dust of the endless Russian plains. The battle line stretches nearly two thousand miles. The Soviet army fought extremely bravely. Not only have British officers who inspected the Soviet front lines praised the efficiency of its military organization and the excellence of its equipment, but even the invaders are astonished and dismayed. In Hitler's experience, the uselessness of mass slaughter is here for the first time. He then engaged in the most terrible acts of revenge. Wherever the German army arrives, cities are completely destroyed. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet patriots who defended their homeland have been slaughtered in cold blood by German military police. Since the Mongolian invasion of Europe in the 16th century, such large-scale systematic and cruel slaughter has never occurred. And this is only the beginning. Where Hitler's tanks have passed, famine and pestilence are bound to follow. The current crimes are simply indescribable. However, it is not only Europe that is suffering from the pain of invasion.

### Clearly Issues a Warning to Japan; Determined to Stop Its Military Threat

Japanese warlords, imitating the style of Hitler and Mussolini, and striking a pose as if a new European revelation, have invaded China, and trampled on its 500 million people, for five years now. The Japanese army is engaged in fruitless pursuits on this land, with disaster, destruction, and corruption spreading everywhere, and Japan still calls this the China Incident. Now Japan extends its influence to the South China Sea of China, seizes French Vietnam, and threatens Siam, Singapore, and the Philippines under American protection with its military actions. Such actions should indeed be stopped. All kinds of efforts will be made to seek a peaceful solution. The United States is now, with infinite patience, trying to establish a fair and peaceful solution with Japan, giving the greatest guarantee to Japan's legitimate interests. We sincerely hope that these negotiations can be successful. But I have something to say. If this kind of hope is not realized, then we will naturally, without hesitation, rally to the side of the United States.

I now turn to a tranquil bay somewhere in the Atlantic. There, the sunlight shines, and huge ships flying British and American flags are suspended. When I met with the US President, we held an opinion that although we did not intend to formulate the final and formal goals of war and peace, we had to give a brief wartime statement to the people of all countries, especially the oppressed people, explaining the goals that Britain and the United States wanted to achieve, so that others could join us on the path ahead, which is still difficult and long. However, there are two obvious differences between this and the attitude adopted by the Allies in the later stages of the last war, which cannot be ignored: (1) Britain and the United States do not now assume that there will never be another war in the future, but we want to make full preparations to prevent the recurrence of war in any period we can foresee. The way to do this is to disarm criminal countries in an effective manner on the one hand, and retain adequate protection for ourselves on the other. (2) We do not want to destroy German trade with various commercial obstacles, as was done in 1917. We have indeed embraced a view that if any great power cannot prosper or cannot find a way to enable its country and people to enjoy a suitable life through industry and commerce, it is not a blessing for the world, nor is it a blessing for Britain and the United States. These two points are important changes in principle that all countries should be familiar with.

### Provides a Final Victory Guarantee to People Fighting for Freedom

What is more important is that we should give the hope and guarantee of final victory to the hundreds of millions of people who are fighting for their lives and freedom or groaning under the Nazi yoke. Hitler and his ilk are enticing the people they have harmed to submit to their own destiny, to be whipped and cooperate. What is the so-called new European order that Hitler and his gang want to use to bind Europe first, and then apply to all continents? It is the right of governance of the ruling nation. The purpose of the ruling nation is to eliminate the freedom of democratic constitutional systems and ordinary men, as well as the historical rights of various countries, and replace them with the Prussian-style black iron rule and the strict discipline of the political police imposed on the laboring classes, as well as the concentration camps and firing squads set up everywhere. That is all there is to the so-called new order. Napoleon, in his heyday, had his authority widely shaken. At that time, only the coast of Russia and the solid rocks and fleets of the Strait of Dover stood between them. Napoleon's army, carrying the high tide of the French Revolution, proclaimed the slogans of freedom, equality, and fraternity, sweeping away the dilapidated systems and aristocratic privileges of the Middle Ages. However, Napoleon's empire passed away in an instant, like a dream. Today's Hitler has none of Napoleon's doctrines, nothing but the desire to open up and seize, nothing but the unfortunate production of modern science for the annihilation of human countries. The people conquered by him have encountered extreme suffering. We must give them hope, we must give them the belief that suffering will eventually end and resistance will not be in vain. Even if the journey is dark and long, the end will surely see the light. This is the symbol of the Atlantic Conference.

Brave Norwegians, do not be discouraged. We will not only cleanse your country of invaders, but also sweep away the filthy Quisling who is the tool of the invaders. Czechs, be confident that your independence will be restored. Poles, your people's loyalty and perseverance in resisting brutal oppression and the bravery of your soldiers on land, sea, and air will never be forgotten by us. Your motherland will be resurrected and regain its rightful place in the new organization of Europe. Loyal and brave Frenchmen, raise your heads high. The likes of Darlan and Laval will not be allowed to be obstacles to restoring your inherent rights. Persevering Belgians, Dutchmen, Luxembourgers, Yugoslavs, and honorable Greeks, although you have been humiliated by the enemy, do not show the slightest retreat. Keep the purity of your souls. When iron and Nazis come into contact, make them realize, when their victory is hopeless, that they are morally abandoned by mankind. Now aid is coming. A large army is now armed for you. Have faith, have hope, and liberation is certain. You must know that the President and the British representatives at their maritime conference have jointly undertaken to finally destroy the Nazi dictatorship. This is a solemn and important undertaking that must be carried out. Now it will be put into practice. Naturally, many practical methods required to implement this undertaking are now being arranged and implemented.

### Deeply Regrets That Countries Failed to Unite; Resulting in the Pain of Being Defeated Individually

Now someone asks, how close is the United States to the war? There is indeed someone who knows how to answer this question. If Hitler has not declared war on the United States, it is not because he cherishes the American system, nor is it because he cannot find an excuse. He has destroyed several countries without any reason. The reason why he dare not declare war is that he is afraid that the United States will immediately double its great power that it is currently using to control him. I believe that this is the real reason, which can be seen in the effective methods that Hitler has followed. What is this method? It is very simple, namely, his piecemeal attack. Hitler has already enslaved a large part of the world using this method. Three and a half years ago, I asked the people of the country to advocate that countries that were aware of the imminent crisis should jointly organize a strong defensive alliance in the principles of the League of Nations. Unfortunately, no one listened to my words at the time. Germany reorganized its military, and all parties remained indifferent, until the Czech Republic was annexed, and the French government betrayed its close friends and broke its promises in the difficulties of its allies. The Soviet Union was deceived into neutrality, and the French army was annihilated. Suppose that the European Low Countries and the Scandinavian Peninsula had united with Britain and France to jointly defend themselves, how would the current situation have occurred? At least there would have been an opportunity to resist. If the Balkan countries had united early, they would have been able to protect themselves and avoid destruction. Alas, they were all isolated and fell one after another. The progress of evil has never been so smooth. Now Germany is attacking the Soviet Union with all its strength, knowing that the Soviet Union is separated from the Western democratic countries and that the transportation of supplies is difficult. But we will do our best to overcome this difficulty and deliver aid to the Soviet Union. We have already decided to hold a meeting of British, American, and Soviet representatives in Moscow to resolve this entire plan. No obstacles will be allowed to occur. Why did Hitler attack the Soviet Union, causing himself serious injuries? This is nothing more than the idea of ​​turning his full strength to attack Great Britain. After defeating the Soviet Union, he would turn to Great Britain, and if he could succeed, he would settle the long-standing old accounts with the United States and the people of the Hemisphere. Piecemeal attack is his means, simple and effective. As long as he can take the final step, he can become the master of the world.

### Fortunately, the US President Revived the Navy; Making a Great Contribution to Mankind

Now I am very happy that someone has woken up early. President Roosevelt, with his true knowledge and insight, saw the great danger facing the British and American people. This is why I am so happy. Thanks to God's protection, President Roosevelt revived the strength of the US Navy eight years ago. Otherwise, today the United States would have to obey the European dictators. The United States has this power to save itself and make an unparalleled contribution to mankind. We held Sunday prayers in a certain bay in the Atlantic. The US President personally boarded a British ship and worshiped with hundreds of British and American soldiers on the deck. On that day, the sun was bright, and we sang hymns passed down from our ancestors, which we had memorized at home since childhood. When we sang Onward Christian Soldiers, I felt that what we are now working on is the destiny that God has already revealed. I looked around at the brave men of the same language, the same faith, the same basic laws, the same ideals, the same interests, and the same dangers, holding a densely arranged prayer. I couldn't help but feel that the only, and also real, hope to save the world from being conquered lies in this. Thus, our courage and determination were even higher. When we crossed the ocean back home, several American destroyers carrying mail to American soldiers in Iceland accompanied us. One afternoon, we arrived in the middle of the Atlantic and met a convoy transporting weapons and supplies made in the New World to help those in the Old World who were protecting themselves. At that time, as far as the eye could see, the sea was full of ships, about seventy or eighty ships of different shapes and sizes, arranged in fourteen rows, with British ships escorting them and airplanes soaring above. I felt even more that although this battle is difficult and long, we have the ability to fulfill our duties and achieve our goals.

### US Makes No Criticism of the British Prime Minister's Speech

United Press International, Washington, 25th

Last night, State Department officials made no criticism after listening to British Prime Minister Churchill's speech. No criticism was made regarding Japan or the reported US mediation of the Far East issue. Non-official personnel expressed great satisfaction with Churchill's statement that Britain would support the United States in its Far East policy, but they believed that the statement of assistance has not been realized recently, because British Foreign Secretary Eden recently made a speech in the House of Commons on the Japanese issue, and his speech in many ways expressed Britain's friendly attitude toward Japan.

### Exports Over Imports and Prices

Ever since the economic panic that re-emerged in European and American countries in 1929, countries have abandoned the doctrine of free trade and re-advocated the mercantilism of the Middle Ages, believing it to be a remedy for the defects of the system. At that time, the United States had just emerged from the dangerous storm and was striving to implement a policy of austerity, drastically reducing imports from Europe, which in turn worsened the economic situation of the countries concerned and promoted the twist and turn of doctrinal choices.

If any country wants to forcibly reduce its imports by artificial means, freeze the lives of the other party, or at the same time adopt coercive measures to increase its exports and seize the markets of other countries, then the seriousness of the impact on the target can be imagined. Those who are well prepared in normal times will inevitably rise up to resist and retaliate, which is the embryo of an artificial control system. The mercantilism of the Middle Ages belonged to one body and occasionally worked in similar ways. At that time, Britain, looking at the failure of free trade, decided to export high-value manufactured goods and exchange them for large quantities of low-value raw materials, thus producing a surplus in exports. Because the total value of exports must be greater than the total value of imports, it could obtain the import of foreign gold to achieve its trade clearing purpose.

The aim of medieval Britain's efforts to make trade exports exceed imports, so as to produce a surplus in exports, and to prevent trade imports from exceeding exports, so as to produce a deficit, was to collect world gold, so as to dominate the economic gains. A few years ago, the countries that tried to increase the surplus of exports and obtain the input of gold were based on the quantity theory of money. After the increase of domestic gold, it could stimulate the rise of prices, so as to eliminate panic and prosper the market. At that time, countries were in a state of depression and could not find a way out. Getting this suggestion, it was okay to test whether the theory and the facts were in line with each other. In practice, countries had no other good way out than to try to reduce imports and save on expenses. Those who were tested based on the above theory included Britain, the United States, Japan, and other countries, but the results were counterproductive. Although exports could be reluctantly increased and the input of gold could be obtained, the stagnation of prices could not be raised, and the market was still as desolate as before, only causing people to be disappointed and sigh.

The explanation for this is enough to show the difficulty of plugging the gaps, and the difficulty of the theory being put into practice. In recent times, those among the Chinese people who hold this theory to test the economic strength have inevitably made a mistake of a thousand miles for every millimeter. During the war, they still want to increase exports and seek the inflow of gold to prosper the market. What is the difference between this and a fool's dream? Economically strong countries cannot do it even while fighting and taking into account the peacetime economic development, let alone economically weak countries? And that the introduction of a deficit is a symbol of economic collapse, how can it be credible, because a country with a deficit must first have purchasing power, so its deficit is also a surplus, what is the benefit? Therefore, the issue of exports over imports is by no means as simple as general analysis, and must be regarded as a judgment. A few months ago, many American economists visited Germany and Japan and praised Germany's economic strength, because the soundness of its production mechanism was beyond the imagination of outsiders. As for the economic mechanism of Japan, it was said that it was far less complete than Germany and that there was a danger of collapse. From this, it can be seen that the analysis of these people is very different from the previous statement.

However, the most urgent outstanding issue to be resolved is the exchange rate and price issue of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee. Commissioner Fox advocated maintaining the exchange rate and the price at the same level. In other words, assuming that the US exchange rate stands at 5 yuan and 32 and 11/100ths, and the rice price stands at 120 yuan, then these two prices must be maintained at this level and not allowed to deviate from each other, because Fox believes that the exchange rate can influence the price. This theory was discussed a few years ago, but there is no solid evidence to be found. According to the fact that my country's rice price has never been affected by the exchange rate and rarely changes, while the rice prices of other countries are instead dominated by my country's rice prices, this is a normal economic activity and is also a good result of the absence of manipulation and monopoly. As Mr. Shafar said, the Shanghai market has no central organization to preside over it, just like the previous Tianjin, where no one cares about the profits that can be made in three days, then everyone will rush to it in shock. Mr. Fox came to this country with great hope, and is especially concerned about the people's livelihood, which we all admire. However, the environment in Shanghai is very different from that of other countries. I would like to say to Mr. Fox not to talk about the exchange rate and the price together, so as not to make the situation more chaotic. On the contrary, I sincerely hope that he will maintain the stability of the price in the way that he maintains the exchange rate, so that several good things can be achieved in one fell swoop.

### Reception for Journalists: Foreign Minister Guo Delivers Speech; Expresses Strong Welcome for Churchill's Warning to Japan; Far East and European Fronts Now Integrated; Japanese Bombing Cannot Destroy People's Fighting Spirit

Chongqing – Foreign Minister Guo gave a speech at a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists on the 25th, first stating that British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast speech yesterday issued a stern warning regarding Japan's further [illegible] in the Far East, which China welcomes greatly. This warning, and the results of talks held separately between the US and Japan in Washington and Tokyo, have made Japan understand that this is a kind of (red light) from democratic countries regarding Japan's [illegible] policy. If Japan ignores this warning, it will clash with (armed police), so it can be seen as Japan's last chance to choose to abandon or continue its [illegible]. I personally doubt whether Japan will accept this warning. We deeply admire Mr. Churchill's broadcast speech, but we do not agree with the point that Japan is imitating the threatening policies of Hitler and Mussolini. I believe that Japan is not only imitating, but in fact, it is the originator of this policy. Japan's threat to democratic countries in Asia has a long history. Foreign Minister Guo continued, stating that one concrete result of the Luo-Qiu talks is that the Far Eastern front and the European front have been integrated, which is gratifying to China. I have always believed that the wars in Europe and Asia are actually two battlefields of the same war. At this point in his speech, Foreign Minister Guo strongly condemned the Japanese planes bombing schools in the rear. Mr. Guo stated that since the Japanese planes frantically bombed our capital, the spirit of our people has been very firm, and the general rescue work has been particularly heroic. Moreover, everyone is able to help reduce losses in their daily work. If the Japanese think that bombing can eliminate our people's will to fight, then they have not learned a lesson in the past four years. The frenzied bombing they have carried out in China has had the opposite effect. After Foreign Minister Guo delivered his speech, foreign journalists successively raised questions: (1) Has Foreign Minister Guo heard anything about the results of the US-Japan talks? Mr. Guo replied that he had not, and said that unless Japan abandons [illegible], democratic countries will never change their anti-aggression stance. Japan's [illegible] behavior has reached an irrecoverable point. Whatever decision the US and Japan make, I believe it will not conflict with the Atlantic Charter. (2) What about the news that Japan has made demands on Thailand? Mr. Guo replied that he had not received any reports recently, but since Thailand's attitude has become tougher, Japan's pressure on Thailand seems to have eased. However, I do not believe that Japan has given up on Thailand; it has only made slight changes in its tactics. In short, with the help of the UK and the US, Thailand will definitely adopt a tough policy. (25th dispatch)

Chongqing – Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi stated yesterday afternoon when receiving journalists that China is quite satisfied with British Prime Minister Churchill's broadcast. Regarding the President's attempt to discuss a solution with Japan, Mr. Guo doubts whether any solution is possible because the democratic countries have decided to curb Japan's continued aggression, while Japan insists on its established policy of continuing expansion. However, he said that any solution must be consistent with the eight principles outlined in the Atlantic Conference. Mr. Guo also said that the British Prime Minister's broadcast clearly stipulated limits. If Japan tries to advance beyond this, it will inevitably encounter resistance from the combined forces of the UK and the US. However, he wished to make a correction to the British Prime Minister's broadcast, namely that Japan is not imitating Hitler and Mussolini, because Japan's consistent aggression in the Pacific began long before Hitler and Mussolini even wanted to begin aggression.

### For Easier Air Raid Precautions, Many Foreigners in Chongqing Also Use the Lunar Calendar; The Middle of Each Lunar Month is a Dangerous Period; All Dinner Gatherings are Suspended at That Time

Chongqing – Many American and other foreign nationals in Chongqing use a calendar that combines both the solar and lunar calendars. This is because the full moon always occurs on the fifteenth day of the lunar month, and around the time of the full moon, Japanese planes almost always come for night raids. Therefore, it is more convenient to use the lunar calendar when planning dinner parties or evening gatherings. According to experience in Chongqing, the dangerous period is between the tenth and twentieth or twenty-first day of each lunar month in the summer and early autumn. This experience is very accurate, so many activities, such as evening theatrical performances, are often suspended during the period from the tenth to the twenty-first. The air defense authorities also advise the public to prepare some extra snacks or other portable food during this period because daytime raids often follow night raids, and the public is trapped in air raid shelters for long periods of time and cannot prepare food. Sometimes, people are continuously trapped in air raid shelters for up to fourteen hours, with less than thirty minutes of time between the all-clear signals. During the period from the tenth to the fifteenth of the lunar month, air raids often occur in the first half of the night, starting at sunset on the first day or two, and then gradually later as the moonlight increases. After the fifteenth, the air raids start later, often beginning between 3 and 4 a.m. on the last few nights. On a beautiful moonlit night on the campus of the American School or elsewhere, the moon is generally still popular, but during the bombing season in Chongqing, people will have a completely different view of the moon in a month or two.

Reuters, London, 25th – According to responsible sources in London, Soviet troops are entering Iran from the Caucasus, while British troops are taking the route through southern Iran. The British troops entering Iran are directly under the command of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army. The British Navy in the Persian Gulf is commanded by Admiral Arbuthnot, Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies. No information regarding the plans for this military operation can be released at this time.

Reuters, Moscow, 25th – Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has notified Iranian Ambassador Seyed that Soviet troops have crossed the Iranian border today. The notification stated that, in view of the activities of German intelligence personnel within Iran, which threaten the security of the Soviet Union, and the Iranian government's refusal to take measures to deal with German activities, the Soviet government believes that it is necessary to implement the provisions of Article 6 of the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty and send troops into Iran to protect its interests. The notification then recounted the diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Iran over the years, stating that recently, the activities of German intelligence personnel within Iran have reached the point of threatening the Soviet Union and Iran itself. German intelligence agents have infiltrated more than fifty Iranian government agencies and are trying to cause trouble to disrupt Iran's peaceful life and incite Iran against the Soviet Union, and force Iran into war against the Soviet Union.

Reuters, Simla, 25th – A Japanese official announced that the British and Soviet governments have taken joint military action in Iran today. The intention of this action is solely to ensure that the Axis powers no longer have any opportunity to threaten the security of the Soviet Union, the Middle East, and India, and to prevent Iran's oil production and other resources from falling into Nazi hands, as Iran itself is unable to prevent this. Therefore, this action is a means of guaranteeing security and has no intention of interfering with Iran's independence.

Reuters, London, 25th – British troops entered Iran this morning, the last natural fortress of Eurasia, which has become the source of Nazi conspiracies to encircle the Soviet Union and a starting point for the German invasion of India. London sources stated today that the Iranian government's response to the Anglo-Soviet note of August 15 indicated that it was not prepared to accept the Anglo-Soviet suggestions to its satisfaction, and further negotiations would be futile. Therefore, the British and Soviet governments must take other measures to protect their important interests.

Havas, Rome, 25th – According to reliable sources here, Soviet troops have invaded Iran from the east of the Caspian Sea, with Astrakhan as their destination. Another army has departed from the Transcaucasus and is heading straight for Lake Urmia and the city of Tabriz. The ultimate goal of both armies is to occupy the entire coast of the Caspian Sea and the northern provinces of Iran. British troops are heading for Khorramshahr. Iranian military authorities have not deployed defenses along the border, but have concentrated troops in key areas inland. As of now, no fighting has occurred.

Associated Press, London, 25th – News from Ankara this morning stated that Iran is prepared to deal with the British army's invasion from Baghdad and Basra across the border. News reports that a secret radio station in Iran managed by Germans announced that British Indian troops and Soviet troops have crossed the Iranian border. News from Cairo stated that German radio stations announced that four divisions of the British Indian Army were assembled on the Iranian border. Meanwhile, special news from Tehran, Germany, stated that German embassy officials are rapidly preparing to evacuate German women and children, but the city is still quiet. It is heard that the newspapers only hinted at the tense situation yesterday. Tehran news stated that yesterday there were heavy trucks and long trains departing from Tehran, mostly heading south. Troops and artillery have rushed to the border. News from Cairo stated that Iran is conducting recruitment throughout the country, and it is estimated that the total number of troops will reach 100,000, equipped with weapons made in Sweden, Britain, Japan, and Germany, as well as a small number of tanks and 100 aircraft, most of which are made in Britain.

### On the Southern Odessa Front: Red Army Continues to Win Victories; Romanian Army Suffers Extremely Heavy Losses; Two Infantry Divisions Annihilated in Succession

TASS, Moscow, 25th – The Soviet Information Bureau issued a battle report stating that fierce fighting continued on the night of the 23rd and the morning of the 24th on the Northern Kinche Sasaura, the Central Smolensk, and the Southern Odessa fronts. The battle situation on the Southern Odessa front was extremely fierce, and the Romanian army suffered extremely heavy losses. In addition to the 15th Division being annihilated, its 3rd Division has also been crushed, with a total of ten thousand killed and wounded. Only eight hundred survived. In the most recent battle, our army captured 24 artillery pieces, 115 machine guns, 20 light artillery pieces, and 5 anti-tank guns. The Romanian 3rd Division no longer exists.

TASS, Moscow, 25th – On the Southern Odessa front, in addition to annihilating the Romanian 3rd and 15th Divisions, the Red Army recently achieved another great victory. The Romanian 5th and 7th Divisions were both heavily damaged. The 5th Division suffered a total of 9,000 killed and wounded, and lost 25 artillery pieces, 140 machine guns, 15 tanks, and 30 trucks. The 7th Division suffered 7,000 killed and wounded and lost 100 machine guns and many other military supplies.

Reuters, London, 25th – The Berlin radio station announced that German troops had occupied the Black Sea port of Ochakov (between the Odessa [illegible] and the mouth of the Dnieper River). It was claimed that after the troops under General Popov of the Soviet Union retreated across the Dnieper River, Ochakov was isolated and the German troops captured it, taking 800 prisoners and seizing 18 anti-aircraft guns and 30 artillery pieces. The German side also claimed to have repelled the Soviet attempt to land troops on the Estonian coast from the Gulf of Finland. The German official news agency said that Soviet troops departed from three Soviet ships and attempted to land in small boats. They and their crew were "annihilated." Although the German mechanized army advanced to Novgorod ahead of the main force, there are still large numbers of Soviet troops behind them fighting separately. The German official news agency reported that there was fierce fighting on the Estonian border between Lake Peipus and Lake Ilmen, 110 miles east of Leningrad, indicating that part of the Soviet troops led by General Voroshilov is still fighting at least 150 miles from Leningrad. The news agency also stated that the German troops in the north broke through heavily fortified defenses and continued to advance after destroying concrete and steel bunkers and trenches. Several newly built military bridges in the area (the large one on the Pliussa River) have been captured by the German troops.

Reuters, London, 25th – A Soviet communiqué stated that on the evening of August 24, our troops continued to fight strongly in the Kexholm, Dnepropetrovsk, and Novgorod directions. According to reports from our patrol ships, four German transport ships protected by motorboats in the Baltic Sea encountered the Soviet fleet. The German ships spotted the Soviet ships and sailed towards the coast, using the coastline as cover. Soviet gunners opened fire on the German transport ships and motorboats. A few minutes later, a Soviet ship fired a torpedo and hit a German transport ship, which sank immediately. The second German transport ship saw this and immediately sailed towards the coast and ran aground on the beach. The German motorboats attempted to release a smokescreen, but it was ineffective. Our destroyer sank two of the motorboats. The third German transport ship was also hit and caught fire and sank. The fourth transport ship also ran aground and was unable to move. One of the German transport ships was carrying troops, tanks, and military supplies.

Soviet Troops Counterattack Several Days Ago: Defeat a German Infantry Division

Reuters, London, 25th – General Timoshenko, commander of the Soviet troops in the central front, recently issued a special order congratulating his subordinates for their great defeat of the German army. This may refer to the counterattack launched by General Konev's troops several days ago. According to recent news, this Soviet counterattack defeated the German 164th Infantry Division, killing 3,000 German officers and soldiers, destroying its headquarters and 130 tanks, more than 100 trucks, and many artillery pieces, and continued to capture several villages. The German reinforcements that came from the rear were also defeated. The news from the German side in the area only mentioned German aircraft's fierce attacks on Soviet traffic. News from the Ukrainian Dnieper River bend reported that a Soviet cavalry unit had driven the German troops out of a town and occupied the headquarters of a German division. 700 German corpses were left in the town. In the north, Leningrad is still in a dangerous situation. The German side said that it had occupied many villages in the Karelian Isthmus, causing Vyborg, 80 miles from Leningrad (ceded to the Soviet Union last year), to be isolated. The German side is now describing the development of battles more than 100 miles from Leningrad. It is said that German troops attacked Soviet defenses between Lake Peipus and Lake Ilmen and advanced southeast along the Leningrad-Moscow railway, crossing the Lovat River. The German side also acknowledged that German troops in Estonia are still advancing towards Tallinn, and the Soviet reinforcements sent from the sea have been defeated by German tank troops. Although the fighting in Estonia is far behind the German troops who are trying to seize Leningrad, the German military headquarters spokesperson in Berlin said that the Estonian war is the second of the three major battles on the Eastern Front. He also said that the remaining two battles are the German army consolidating its positions on the Dnieper River in preparation for further fighting, and the German army's two wings surrounding a large group of elite Soviet troops north of Kiev. The spokesperson also prepared the German side for winter fighting in the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union still has a large area in Europe for retreat, and US support is too late to provide significant assistance to the Soviet Union.

Reuters, London, 25th – It is reported that Soviet troops are now launching a fierce counterattack northwest of Leningrad. The Kronstadt naval fortress, 18 miles west of the city, is still in Soviet hands, and Pskov has not fallen. In Ukraine, German troops have not crossed the Dnieper River.

The War Has Entered Its Tenth Week: Germany Still Has No Hope of Victory

Reuters, London, 15th – A military commentator said that the war on the Eastern Front has entered its tenth week, and the German army has not yet achieved a decisive victory. The war is proceeding along the entire front from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. The German army's desperate attacks are meeting with resolute resistance from the Soviet army everywhere. The Soviet army is showing signs of counterattacks, and its morale is higher than at any time since the start of the war. In fact, the Soviet army around Smolensk in the central sector has now begun to take the initiative. The enemy first transferred its main force to the area and then tried to find a point of attack that was easy to launch in the north or south, so the enemy's main force in the area may have been weakened. However, since the Soviet side has a huge reserve strength, the German side cannot reduce its troops at will in any area. General Timoshenko of the Soviet Union now has sufficient time to prepare for a fierce counterattack. On the northern front, the German side claimed to have won a local victory near Lake Ilmen, and Finnish troops have also achieved success. However, the German and Finnish troops' attempt to seize Leningrad does not seem to have made significant progress. It is now clear that Tallinn is difficult to capture, as is Odessa in the south. The German side seems to have given [illegible] the opportunity to seize Odessa, but has so far failed to capture it. It is reported that the German side is now pressing [illegible] to send a large number of troops to reinforce, which proves that the "new order" is an increasingly heavy burden on the German side's dependent countries.

### It is Reported that England and America are Proposing Three Conditions to Japan; Vichy French Newspapers Disclose the Contents

According to a Vichy dispatch from the Associated Press on the 25th, based on Churchill's speech last night stating that he would do his best to cooperate with the United States to resolve the Pacific issue, it seems to confirm reports from Shandong that England and America have discussed with Japan to establish a "Three-Point Agreement." This move is the result of recent discussions between Churchill and Roosevelt during the Pacific Conference. Newspapers supporting the Axis powers here have published the contents of the agreement, which include the following points: (1) Recognizing Japan's right to advance southward, but only limited to purely economic aggression, without territorial seizure; (2) Recognizing Japan's special rights in China, but in accordance with the Nine-Power Treaty; (3) If Japan allows the United States to mediate, it will do its best to help end the war in China. French observers believe that if Japan agrees to give up all rights to territorial expansion and withdraw from China and other occupied areas, England and America will allow Japan to obtain all the raw materials it needs in the Far East, such as [missing word] and rubber. This agreement is of direct concern to France, as it may change the Franco-Japanese agreements of 1940 and 1941, which allowed Japan to occupy Vietnam militarily and economically.

According to a Washington dispatch from Havas on the 25th, Senator Bloom, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said that the British Prime Minister has given new hope to the countries conquered by Hitler. Churchill's speech involved Japan and warned the country, which is considered very important by all parties. According to Committee member Thomas, "Prime Minister Churchill made it clear to Japan that it should separate from Germany and Italy."

### America Builds New Ordnance Factory

According to a Washington dispatch from Havas on the 25th, the United States recently established a new ordnance factory in Anniston, Alabama, with a total cost of $7 million. Construction began on January 21 last year and has now been completed, five weeks ahead of schedule. This ordnance factory exclusively manufactures Curtiss-Wright fighters and motorized ambulances to supply to the United Kingdom. This new type of fighter plane is considered superior to the products of any aircraft factory, with 1,150 horsepower and capable of flying to an altitude of 20,000 feet.

### Beaverbrook Returns to England from America

According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 25th, British Minister of Supply Beaverbrook recently returned to England from the United States aboard a transport command plane across the Atlantic. He has completed his mission of discussing supply issues in the United States and Canada and has returned to the United Kingdom, landing in a port in Scotland and immediately coming to London. It is reported that he flew to Canada and then to the United States two weeks ago.

### China Believes American-Japanese Negotiations Cannot Achieve Anything

According to a Chongqing dispatch from Havas on the 25th, the strong tone in Churchill's speech warning Japan to stop its southward advance is highly praised here. Political figures said that recent rumors from Japan about continuous negotiations between the United States and Japan on the issue of the Sino-Japanese War have been confirmed by Churchill's speech. However, the content of the discussions concerns the entire Far East, not just the Sino-Japanese War. The Chinese government firmly believes that President Roosevelt will never allow China to make any sacrifices. On the contrary, the main purpose of the US-Japan negotiations guided by Roosevelt is to stop Japan's aggressive ambitions. This is the policy of the United States, not just a hope, and its nature is active, not passive. Political figures here firmly believe that US-Japan negotiations cannot achieve anything. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to regard the current US-Japan negotiations as a prelude to US-Japan war.

### America Transports Military Equipment and Gasoline to the Soviet Union; Japan May Temporarily Not Obstruct to Induce America to Relax the Embargo

According to a Tokyo dispatch from Havas on the 24th, well-informed sources here said that regarding the issue of American military equipment and gasoline being transported to Vladivostok through the seas controlled by the Japanese Navy, the Japanese government has reportedly decided to tolerate it temporarily. It has also decided that if the US government can compensate and the Soviet government can provide certain guarantees to reciprocate Japan's compromising attitude, Japan will still maintain this policy in the near future. From this, it can be seen that Japan has another "card" for bargaining in its diplomacy with the United States. Because the United States has begun to supply gasoline to the Soviet Union, and American oil tankers sailing to the Soviet Union must pass through the Japanese archipelago, Japan could easily intercept them. However, if Japan sees its neighbor the Soviet Union receiving gasoline supplies while it gets nothing, it will be difficult to tolerate this for long. Therefore, if the United States can relax its economic sanctions against Japan and allow it to end the "gasoline embargo," the Japanese government may be able to provide guarantees that it will always be friendly towards the United States regarding the American gasoline supply to the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Japanese government may further request the US government to be cautious and not to provoke Japanese public opinion. For example, the incident on January 31, 1940, when the Japanese mail ship Asama Maru was intercepted by a British cruiser near Yokohama, greatly shocked Japanese public opinion. It is hoped that such incidents will not happen again.

Hoping the Soviet Union Will Also Provide Friendly Guarantees

As for relations with the Soviet Union, since Japan can adopt a compromising attitude towards the transportation of American military equipment to Vladivostok, it also hopes that the Soviet Union will provide guarantees. In other words, the Soviet Union guarantees that it will neither participate in the Anglo-American group to encircle Japan nor use American military equipment to attack Japan. If so, Japan will abide by the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, not hindering the Soviet Union's war against Germany in the slightest, and allowing American military equipment and gasoline to be transported to Vladivostok without obstruction. Conversely, if the Soviet Union refuses to provide the above guarantees and adopts an unfriendly attitude towards Japan in the Anglo-American-Soviet Conference, Japan will have no choice but to regard the Neutrality Pact as invalid. In short, there are credible signs that Japan is trying to use the transportation of American military equipment and gasoline to Vladivostok as a tool to resolve US-Japan issues, in order to break through the difficulties in US-Japan negotiations. Japan's adoption of this method is extremely clever, and its purpose is probably to persuade the Soviet Union to defend Japan in the future Anglo-American-Soviet conference and to encourage the US government to adopt a moderate attitude towards Japan. That's all.

### American is Considering Taking Over Japanese Manila Hemp Factory in the Philippines; Secret Discussions are Underway Regarding Implementation; Japan Allows American Residents in Tokyo to Withdraw

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 25th, it is reported that the US government is currently considering taking over the Japanese Manila hemp factory in Davao Province, Philippines, to cope with the Manila hemp panic in the seabees. Since the US Treasury Department ordered the freezing of Japanese funds, the Manila hemp production in Davao Province has also been affected. Officials are paying close attention to this situation, as 75 percent of US Manila hemp imports in the Philippines are supplied by Davao. It is known that US officials have been secretly meeting with Philippine officials in Washington and Manila to decide how to implement this matter.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 25th, it is reported that most of the American residents who plan to take the "Tatsuta Maru" to Shanghai on August 28 have purchased berths on the ship's hammocks or servants' cabins, as the other cabins have already been fully booked. It is believed that there are two reasons why these American residents can finally leave Japan: one is that the United States is eager to withdraw important personnel in Japan, allowing its military and naval officers, and the other is that Japan wants to get rid of the bad reputation of "using people as hostages." Nippon Yusen Kaisha sold tickets to 26 of these American officials, which was probably under pressure from the Foreign Ministry. After these Americans arrive in Shanghai, they will transfer to the US Pacific Shipping Line's transport ship "Henderson" to return to the United States. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai at the end of the month.

### Honolulu Lloyds Stops Accepting Bombing Insurance

According to a Havas dispatch from Honolulu on the 25th, Brandt, manager of the Honolulu branch of Lloyds Insurance Company, said that the company has decided to stop accepting bombing insurance. However, this decision is not due to fear of war in the Pacific, but to concerns about potential sabotage activities in the area.

### Germany Announces Sinking of Multiple British Ships

According to a quick dispatch from Huitong News Agency in Berlin on the 25th, the German Supreme Command issued the following special military message from the Führer's headquarters on Sunday night, stating that German naval warships and submarines operating overseas have sunk a total of 25 enemy ships, totaling 148,200 tons. Among them, submarines operating in a few days sank a total of 21 enemy merchant ships, totaling 123,000 tons. These merchant ship convoys were from the British base in Gibraltar. In addition, one escort destroyer, one flat-deck warship, and one gunboat were sunk. Only eight [missing word] managed to escape into Portuguese territorial waters.

### France Uses the Excuse of Communist Sabotage to Severely Punish Dissidents; Demonstrations Occur in Paris; Vichy Accuses the Soviet Union of Conspiracy

According to a Reuters dispatch from Vichy on the 25th, Vichy Interior Minister Pucheu declared last night that he would impose extremely severe punishment on communists and others who disturb the peace. It is said that the Pétain government is "equipped with arms to act." It can now assure the people that the government will crush all attempts to oppose its rule without mercy. The sabotage of railways and the demonstrations in Paris are "regrettable" events, which are part of the Soviet plan to cause conflict between France and Germany. He knows that if such activities are allowed to continue to develop, they will cause difficulties. Communist elements, in order to support the Soviet Union, are attempting to incite disputes between civilians and occupying authorities in the occupied areas, creating tension. Therefore, the French authorities must curb these activities to prevent the relationship between the French government and the German authorities from becoming more difficult. Although the action of inciting incidents has taken shape, he must fulfill the mission entrusted to him by Pétain and Darlan and will never allow these actions to continue. Bolshevik elements must not undermine government policies. He will arrest criminals through laws and the police to make them harmless. Pucheu finally announced orders for sentences of hard labor and even death.

The market price returned slightly by 3 or 4 jiao, fluctuating back and forth, and slightly squeezed upward. Changes that have not been seen for many days are difficult to grasp. As a result, the prices of Types D and Xu did not rise or fall, and the rest still improved by 5 fen, 1 jiao, or 2 jiao. The total trading volume was about 1 [missing word] 450,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category  Highest  Lowest  Closing  Compared to Previous Day

Type A  77.20  76.85  76.85  Up 0.20

Type B  71.20  72.00  72.00  Also 0.10

Type C  68.90  68.39  68.50  Also 0.05

Type D  66.35  66.10  66.10  Flat

Type Xu  67.50  66.95  67.00  Flat

Stock trading, trading volume: 40 company shares, priced at 14 yuan.

Also, the stock market of the Public Trading House opened strong and was exceptionally active throughout the day. The total trading volume was estimated at over one million shares. Rubber shares were particularly booming. Xiangtai shares opened at 78 yuan, gradually falling to a low price of 70 yuan, and then returning to 75 yuan. Almost all shares had progress, and the underlying momentum remained firm.

A new British wool textile limited company was recently established by British merchants in this city, with an authorized capital of 10 million yuan in national currency, divided into 2 million shares, each with a par value of 5 yuan in national currency. It is planned to initially raise 1.1 million shares. In addition to using 560,000 shares to pay for the price of a new wool mill built on Weianma Road, 250,000 shares will be allocated for directors and their relatives to subscribe, and the remaining 190,000 shares are scheduled to be publicly raised by the Chartered Bank on the 28th, it is said.

### Another Major Blow to Consumers: You Hoard, I Hoard, Everything is Hoarded; This Rises, That Rises, Everything is Reported to Rise

The price increases in recent days are unusual, all due to the foreign exchange control, which is indecisive, sometimes long, sometimes short, sometimes loosening, sometimes tightening, inexplicable, without any benefit, and speculators have taken this opportunity to act wildly. Gold once reached over 10,000 yuan, silver reached 10 yuan per tael, yarn and calico [missing word], everything skyrocketed. Sugar merchants also raised sugar prices, with white sugar being sold at 1.48 yuan per catty and brown sugar at 1.28 yuan per catty. Mushrooms rose from 18 yuan to 28 yuan, and dried shiitake mushrooms were over 30 yuan. Dried shrimp rose to 19 yuan. Cigarettes, soap, matches, and candles have all been reported to rise in price in recent days. Copper scraps and broken iron have all become scarce goods. And the price of vegetables is more expensive than meat was originally, with green vegetables costing 7 or 8 jiao per catty [missing word]. Other items also became expensive accordingly, too many to list. The reason why foreign goods are expensive is because of hoarding. Since the announcement of the suspension of foreign exchange supply and the prohibited import goods list, everyone has been importing all kinds of foreign goods, so everything has risen in price. Also, since the barbed wire on the edge of the concession was restored, those who make a living from vegetables [missing word] all believed that a blockade was imminent, and high prices were expected. Those with goods all benefited, but consumers without goods were in an unspeakable predicament.

### Cotton Yarn: Fine Yarn Jumps 100 Yuan; "Double Horse" Affected by Rumors; Futures Also Plunge Due to Urgent Selling; Generally Still Dragged Up by High Cotton Prices

The yarn market initially rose and then weakened, but actual transactions remained brisk. Hong Kong merchants showed strong buying interest, so all kinds of yarn rose in price. The price increase of 32-count single yarn was particularly strong. 32-count "Golden City" and "Golden Treasure Star" were even sold for 3,045 yuan, jumping 100 yuan compared to Monday. In addition, "Tian Nv" 20-count yarn also rose by 50 yuan, which shows how strong the yarn market is in general. However, the "Double Horse" factory's standard yarn was sold off by those who profited from it. At the same time, there were rumors in the market that were bearish. In addition, many bulls closed their positions in the exchange, and the market turned loose. However, there is another saying that the price of raw materials is difficult to fall. The price of cotton for 20-count yarn is 450 yuan per picul. Each piece of yarn requires 350 catties of cotton, which is equivalent to 1,575 yuan. In addition, there are miscellaneous expenses of 250 yuan, totaling about 1,825 yuan. Therefore, most cotton merchants are optimistic about the purchase of 20-count yarn. However, after rising for many days, there should be a correction. The high price of 20-count "Double Horse" was 1,742 yuan, and the low price was 1,717 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 1,708 yuan, rising to 26 yuan. Later, it was heard that the price of yarn and cloth in the exchange fell, and it fell back to 1,703 yuan at the close.

"Double Horse" opened in the morning, and due to the tight term, it made up for the short positions. The opening price was 1,735 yuan, but it was sold off by those who profited from it, and fell back to 1,725 yuan. Later, it was heard that the spot price of 20-count "Blue Phoenix" was 1,780 yuan, and the market sentiment was revived. At the same time, Guang merchants were eagerly searching for spot yarn, and the spot price rose further, gradually rising to 1,745 yuan. When it came to the close, due to rumors, the forward contract in the exchange fell by 18 yuan, and the market sentiment weakened again. The selling pressure increased sharply, falling to 1,717 yuan at the close. It was found that the total turnover in half a day was 8,600 bales. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 600, Local Merchants 8,000, Total 8,600.

The "Golden Double Horse" futures market was fluctuating wildly, completely dominated by rumors. When it opened in the morning, although the U.S. cotton price fell slightly, the factory's orders continued to advance with the remaining momentum of the weekend. Therefore, those engaged in futures yarn exerted their influence, successively entering the pull-up, so the buying interest was strong, with a tendency to go straight to the sky. Later, various rumors such as the peace between China and Japan and the problems in the local area caused a major blow to the multi-party spirit, and suddenly turned from buying to selling, so the trading floor was completely monopolized by sellers, and fell sharply. The opening prices for September, October, and November contracts in the morning were 1,610 yuan, 1,646 yuan, and 1,678 yuan respectively. The October and November contracts each rose by 8 to 12 yuan. After that, they gradually rose, with the September contract reaching as high as 1,626 yuan, the October contract 1,659 yuan, and the November contract 1,681 yuan. Suddenly, bearish rumors arose, and the exchange also showed a sharp decline. Seeing the fluctuations, the bulls saw that the trading floor was full of sellers, and the market price turned from firm to soft, and the footing was unstable. The noon close for the September contract was 1,625.50 yuan, the October contract was 1,654 yuan, and the November contract was 1,664.50 yuan, with mixed gains and losses. The turnover in the morning was 17,490 bales. In the afternoon, it felt even more sluggish, and the potential of buyers was weaker. The market was depressed and fell again. As a result, the near-term contract was 1,610 yuan, and the closing was flat. The far-term October and November contracts each fell by 10 to 21 yuan. The total turnover for the day was 37,360 bales, an increase of 20,100 bales compared to the previous day. As of the 23rd, the amount of three-month storage was 22,290 bales, including 7,560 bales for the September contract, 10,370 bales for the October contract, and 4,360 bales for the November contract. The opening, high, low, and closing prices for the day are recorded on the left (net quotation):

Opening - Highest - Lowest - Closing - Compared to Previous Day

September 1,610.00 - 1,627.00 - 1,599.00 - 1,610.00 - Unchanged
October 1,646.00 - 1,659.00 - 1,629.00 - 1,638.00 - Down 10.00
November 1,678.00 - 1,686.00 - 1,644.00 - 1,645.00 - Down 12.00

### Brazilian Cotton Orders Completed: 1,400 Bales

The Shanghai cotton market became active again. The only reason for the continued excitement of the cotton market is that it is now possible to apply for standard foreign exchange for ordering foreign cotton. At the same time, compared with the black market US dollar, the market price per dan has a difference of more than 50 yuan. Therefore, regardless of yarn mills or cotton firms, they have abandoned the trend of collecting spot goods and turned their attention to directly purchasing Brazilian cotton or US cotton from various cotton trading houses. It is also heard that the purchase price is very low, and the selling price on the market is extremely high, so the profit is very high, even surpassing all speculative businesses in Shanghai. Yesterday, nearly 1,400 bales of Brazilian cotton were transacted.

A large amount of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's "Mao Sheng" wheel brought 4,979 pieces of Indian cotton from Hong Kong and stacked them on the Roosevelt Wharf.

The spot cotton situation is still advancing. Coarse and fine cotton have risen in price. Although the mills' appetite is not strong, cotton merchants, seeing the rising price of yarn, are very tight-fisted. The price of coarse cotton has risen by another 7 or 8 yuan. However, in the afternoon, the bid price and yarn and cloth fell at the same time, and the market sentiment turned more cautious, which affected the reduction in transactions.

Special Note: De Lin No. 4, 100 Pieces Delivered to the Warehouse

Special Brazilian Cotton 7, 140 Pieces
Medium Indian Cotton 100 Pieces
Indian Yam 200 Pieces
339 100 Pieces
335 200 Pieces
Special Middling Lin 382 100 Pieces

### Coal: Fuel Panic Will Become More Serious; Foreign Firms Stop Selling White Coal, Prices Soar to 520 Yuan

Although the listed price of Jardine Matheson's White Coal is still 480 yuan, since the peers stopped selling last week, there is no market for it, which is equivalent to a mere formality. As a result, stores in this street have no goods to sell and have to pay high prices to search for old orders in the market for supply. Therefore, hoarders can hold out for higher prices, manipulate them, and the off-the-book price has reached 500 yuan. A few transactions were made yesterday, with a price of 520 yuan, so the prices in the stores on this street are very chaotic and have no standard. If the merchants continue to manipulate like this, the fuel shortage will become more serious.

### Grain: "Small Squeeze" Falls Again

Yesterday, foreign rice fell sharply again, and the form was even weaker than last weekend. The market has a large inventory, and the source is continuously arriving. In addition to frequent new transactions, yesterday, He Ji Shen Ji and other foreign firms had the latest legal foreign exchange application arrived, so they sold 1,750 tons of "Small Squeeze" ready-to-load at a low price of 142.5 yuan. It is also heard that there are several other batches in negotiation, so the market sentiment was shocked, and both futures and spot rice fell. The spot price of "Small Squeeze" from Yinghua Company was as low as 140 yuan, the price of Lu goods was 144-145 yuan, and the price of No. 2 was still 135 yuan to 133 yuan. The spot price of "Small Squeeze" fell again to 116 yuan, which was 4 yuan lower than the price of the "Small Squeeze" sold at a reduced price. Although some floating households and retail customers took advantage of the small price to purchase at the close, the market price recovered slightly, but the market sentiment was still depressed. The total transaction volume of spot rice was more than 10,000 bags, and Yinghua Company accounted for about 700-800 tons.

A large batch of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's "Mao Sheng" wheel arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying 34,558 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Yu Sheng's wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (4th), also carrying 18,900 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which were also unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf.

Thick and thin japonica rice and domestic rice are popular with local stores, but due to the small amount of goods arriving, the owners are unwilling to sell them easily. Under the sale, the market is forced to stabilize. Jiangnan early rice opened at 152 yuan to 150 yuan and 5 jiao. Wuxi original packaged special japonica rice opened at 154 yuan, and the general market opened at 149 yuan. As for Pudong new japonica rice, due to the sunny weather, there is more new rice coming out. More than 20 shi arrived at the port, but the outlet is still the same, so the selling price is difficult to stabilize and is soft. It is estimated that the opening price is 156 yuan to 155.5 yuan. The Hong Kong goods of glutinous rice have always followed the lead of foreign rice. Now that foreign rice is falling again, the market sentiment is also depressed, and the sales are sluggish, so the selling price has followed suit. The opening price of Hong Kong special yuan was 130 yuan, high-quality goods 128 yuan, secondary goods to 124 yuan, glutinous rice 116 yuan, secondary goods to 112 yuan, and the price of domestic yuan was unavailable due to lack of goods.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Rapeseed is in Short Supply

Recently, rapeseed has been in great demand due to the strong competition from various oil mills and the continuous purchase from Japanese merchants, so the situation is very good. The price of rapeseed in Wuhu has risen to 63-64 yuan, and the price of secondary goods is 60 yuan, which is more than 10 yuan higher than the previous week.

### Gray Cloth: Many Floating Traders Sold for Profit; Eastern Cloth Advanced Rapidly and Retreated Quickly; -Factory Cloth is Apparently Loose but Actually Tight-

Factory Cloth: The market rose first and then fell yesterday. The trend is still firm. As a result, most cloth prices are still higher than last week. Fugui fine cloth sold for 53 yuan and 7.5 jiao in the morning, and fine twill returned by 5 jiao. Yihua's coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and other grades rose by 2.5 jiao to 1 yuan, because the goods are tighter. The transaction volume of various cloths in this street was more than 300 pieces. Nanyang merchants handled more than 200 pieces of bleached cloth and bleached twill colored cloth, and Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled more than 300 pieces of blue twill, etc.

Eastern Cloth: Rose sharply and fell quickly. The market turned weak. At the beginning of the morning, due to the pull of outside hoarders, the rising trend became more and more intense. The leading fine cloth factory's orders were quoted at 59 yuan and 5.6 jiao. Later, the futures in the market exchange fell sharply, and the price fell directly. The leading spot orders fell to 58 yuan at the close, which was 5 jiao lower than last week. Futures all fell by more than 1 yuan per piece. The new orders for Four Gentlemen Serge reached a peak of 1 yuan, 3 jiao and 4 fen, and fell back to 1 yuan, 2 jiao and 4 fen and 75 at the evening close. The new orders for old taxes fell to 1 yuan, 2 jiao and 1 fen and a half.

### North and South Goods: Yuanzhi Enters the Market; Secondary Goods Have Not Been Traded

Jinshan Yuanzhi: The new goods this year are very scarce. A small number of the first batch arrived. Because they are not high-quality goods and the cost is high, they were shown yesterday. Because the grains are small and not very suitable for sales, the asking price is too different, so they have not been traded. The old goods opened up by 10-20 yuan, and the high-quality goods are even firmer.

### Shanghai Merchants' Foreign Exchange Applications Are All Concentrated in Hong Kong for Decision; The Standards for Review and Selection Are Extremely Strict; It is Said That British and American Experts Will Continue to Hold Meetings

The foreign exchange management issue in Shanghai, which is under public scrutiny, has been resolved satisfactorily after Hall-Patch, a British member of the Equalization Fund, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and consulted with Dr. Taylor, an American official stationed in Shanghai, and key members of Chinese and foreign banks. According to what the reporter of New Voice News Agency learned from the National Bank yesterday, the central agency for managing foreign exchange in Shanghai is still the Equalization Fund Committee's temporary office in Hong Kong. All the proposed methods and review procedures are concentrated and implemented by the office. Although designated Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai will supply foreign exchange for the import of necessities, the right to make all decisions is in the hands of the Equalization Fund Committee. The application forms for applying for the supply of foreign exchange are currently being printed by the four banks and will be distributed to designated Chinese and foreign banks soon. Importers applying for foreign exchange for necessities must fill out the application form in accordance with the regulations and be approved by the Equalization Committee before they are allowed to settle and sell.

Application Procedures Are Extremely Strict

Importers engaged in the trade of necessities may request supply from any designated bank. The foreign exchange rate is determined by the Equalization Committee, deducting the commission due to the bank, which is US$5.3125 and US$3.15625. The first step for importers is to fill out the application form, in which they should indicate the applicant's name, purpose, tariff number, commodity name, country of origin, quantity or weight, value, port of departure and date, place of import, sales area, foreign exchange currency, amount, date required, place of remittance, and remarks, etc. They must also prepare supporting documents and send them to the Hong Kong Equalization Fund Committee through the designated bank for review. The Equalization Committee has full power to decide whether to approve or not. If approved, the designated bank will supply it according to the approved amount, and then the bank can replenish it from the Equalization Committee in the same amount. As for the period between application and approval, due to the uncertain shipping schedule between Shanghai and Hong Kong, the transfer of the application form is very time-consuming, but it is at least one week. In other words, one week after the application, it can be known whether it is approved or not.

Review and Selection Have Definite Standards

The review is also very detailed. After receiving the application form transferred from Shanghai, the Hong Kong office of the Equalization Fund Committee will immediately check whether the items applied for foreign exchange are necessary and how important they are. In theory, the import of all necessities (referring to those stipulated by the Executive Yuan in September 1940) is allowed to settle foreign exchange, regardless of their importance. However, in consideration of the impact of the Equalization Fund itself on the amount, the Equalization Fund will choose the important necessities and supply the full amount of foreign exchange equal to the value of the goods. As for the essential or re-essential necessities and items that are close to luxury and are not included in the prohibited import category, the Equalization Committee may consider the situation and allow the settlement of part or all of it or refuse to supply it. From this, it can be seen that the Equalization Fund Committee has the opportunity and ability to directly control foreign exchange from Shanghai. The designated Chinese and foreign banks are only intermediate agencies for importers to apply to the Equalization Committee. This method will be fully implemented after the application form is printed, and speculative elements in the name of importers will not be able to use their old tricks.

Chinese Commercial Banks Are Also Allowed to Operate

According to the provisions of the general note of the United States, the banks that can operate foreign exchange business are HSBC, Citibank, McGarrah, Advantage, Tongjilong, Chase, Sassoon, New Sassoon, Old Sassoon, Moscow National, Netherlands, Ander, Aia, United Express, etc., fourteen friendly banks and the four Chinese banks of China, (the Central Bank and the Farmers Bank foreign exchange business is handled by the China Communications Bank), Shanghai's Chinese commercial banks such as Guohua, Xingye, Shiye, Kenye, Shanghai, Zhongnan, Jin Cheng, Overseas Chinese, Zhongxing, East Asia, Continental, and Guohuo, etc., are not included in the regulations. The unfinished foreign exchange business of each bank before the freeze was all settled on August 15, and the Central Bank collected and cleared it on its behalf. However, after the discussion between Taylor and key members of the banking community, in order to protect the interests of Chinese commercial banks, each bank is allowed to operate foreign exchange business. If importers request a supply of foreign exchange, they must transfer it to China or Communications to apply to the Equalization Fund Committee for approval, and they may not directly request it from the Equalization Committee. Under this circumstance, the China Communications Bank does not charge a handling fee, and the commission of 0.3125 (same as the US dollar) is entirely received by the Chinese commercial bank.

The First Batch of Applications Is Under Review

According to news from foreign banks, after the Equalization Fund Committee announced the supply of US and British exchange at the prices of 5 yuan, 3 jiao, 4 fen, 3 li, 75 and 3 yuan, 1 jiao, 8 fen, 75, some importers in the area have requested foreign exchange settlement from designated banks. Although this was before the implementation of the measures agreed upon by the Shanghai banks and Dr. Taylor, in order to maintain legitimate trade, the batch of applications has been sent to the Hong Kong Equalization Committee for review. The review method and standards are the same as those mentioned above.

Specific Measures Are Waiting for Instructions from Hong Kong

According to a report from Da Zhong News Agency, since the Equalization Committee announced that it specially approved the China, China, Communications, Farmers, and HSBC, McGarrah, Advantage, Citibank, and Chase nine banks to comply with the provisions of the United States General Note No. 58 and are not included in the Chinese government's banned items list of British and American imported goods, foreign exchange can be supplied at the new exchange rate. As of yesterday, the above basic principles have not changed. However, in recent days, it has been rumored that the supply of foreign exchange will be restricted by classifying necessities. According to the director of the Foreign Exchange Department of a certain National Bank Shanghai Branch, as of now, what can be told is that the specific measures have not yet arrived in Shanghai, and the established principles have not changed. We have not yet started to handle this business. The list of embargoed items reported is not the most recent revision, so this bank is currently waiting for it to be delivered from Hong Kong as a basis.

Meetings Will Be Convened Soon

According to the North China Daily News, regarding the foreign exchange issue in Shanghai, British and American experts from the China Equalization Fund Committee have held a meeting with foreign and Chinese commercial banks in the city. It is learned that meetings will be convened soon to discuss and improve the foreign exchange market in Shanghai.

### The Central Bank Is Ordered to Handle the Unfreezing of Domestic and Foreign Exchange Funds; Purchasing or Depositing at the Market Price; If You Want to Withdraw in the Original Currency, It Is Limited to Proper Use

After the Central Bank was issued a general note by the US government, it has settled the unfinished foreign exchange business of Chinese commercial banks before July 26 in accordance with the provisions of Note No. 60 on August 15, and the Central Bank collected and cleared it on its behalf in order to avoid freezing of funds. Regarding how to unfreeze the funds of Chinese people, the Ministry of Finance has notified that the Central Bank will purchase them at the market price, or transfer them to the bank to open a new account in the original currency. However, withdrawals should be applied for in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance and are limited to proper and necessary uses, such as ordering goods necessary for China, but must not conflict with the list of items in the prohibited import measures during the emergency period. Regarding the market price of foreign currencies, the Ministry has stipulated: (1) US$5.165, (2) GBP3.325, (3) Indian Rupee 17.5, (4) HK$21.

### US Judge: Washington D.C. Has Telegraphed Yesterday - Sending Mr. Ruden to Serve Temporarily

The English-language American Evening Post reported that Mr. Ruden, a well-known lawyer and commissioner of the US Consular Court in Shanghai, received a telegram from Washington today (the 25th), appointing him to temporarily serve as US Judge in China during the period when the US Judge in China, Mr. Heilmic, is on leave to return to the United States.

If Taylor does not have a lawyer, the Judge's Office will appoint a lawyer to

Defend

Him. After Taylor was arrested on August 9 for embezzlement of public property, he was unable to post bail and was imprisoned in Ward Road Prison pending trial.

### Shenchang Foreign Firm Workers Strike - Clash with Police - More Than Ten People Injured

At around noon yesterday, all the workers in the factory and warehouse of Shenchang Foreign Firm at No. 86 Tongliang Road, Yangshupu, suddenly went on strike. It is not known how they clashed with the detectives, and it is said that more than ten workers were injured. It is understood that the factory originally provided rice subsidies of 60 yuan and allowances of 165% to all workers, and each worker could get more than 100 yuan. Now, due to the shrinking foreign exchange, the factory has changed the rice subsidies to 45 yuan, the allowances to 153%, and canceled the night shift, resulting in a sharp reduction in workers' income. On the 22nd, representatives were pushed to petition to maintain the original number. Because there was no response, all the workers went on strike yesterday.

### Public Bus Labor and Management Agree - Resume Service This Morning - Stopped Yesterday Due to Demands for Improved Treatment - There Should Be No Problems Today to Resume

The workers of the China Public Bus Company, in view of the increasing cost of living in Shanghai, which has led to insufficient income, demanded that the company increase workers' allowances and improve the personnel management system. The coppersmith workers first went on strike at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, and the ticket drivers responded and went on strike yesterday morning. The Public Concession authorities immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to Kangnuo Road, the entrance of the company, to be on strict guard. At the same time, the Huxi Special Police also dispatched a number of people to station at the entrance of the company.

Mediation Agreement - Prerequisites

The authorities sent personnel to negotiate with the company at 2:00 PM yesterday. In order to maintain public transportation and labor-management cooperation, it was decided to have two prerequisites: (1) The company accepts the workers' demands and strives to improve the personnel management system. (2) Increase workers' allowances and negotiate openly after the workers resume work. It was also agreed that the vehicle and machine workers will all resume work first this morning. After the above prerequisites were agreed upon, the labor side notified all workers, and all workers will resume work this morning. At the same time, the company is also preparing to resume the operation of vehicles.

Plan to Resume Traffic This Morning

Since the vehicle workers went on strike, all public buses on all routes have been completely suspended. Route 1: Zhaofeng Park to the Bund; Route 2: Sichuan Road Bridge to Anhe Temple Road; Route 5: North Railway Station to Sanmaoge Bridge; Route 7: Nanyang University to Caojiadu; Route 9: Zhaofeng Park to Nanjing Road Bund; Route 10: Caojiadu to the Bund; Route 12: Nanyang University to the Bund; Route 14: Dunxin Road to the Bund; Route 15: Huifu Road to the Bund.

Evacuation Ship

According to the news obtained from the shipping industry yesterday, the American President Line's "Café Phil" will arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month for some of the American nationals who have withdrawn from the city to take back to the country. According to the American President Line, there are usually only two ships per month that pass through Shanghai and return to the United States. This month, in addition to the "Coolidge" and "Harrison", there will be one more "Café Phil". Most of the American nationals here are now preparing to take two specially dispatched American President Line ships to leave Shanghai and return to the United States. The first ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai in the first week of September, and the second ship will leave Shanghai in the first week of October.

### Traffic Outside the Settlement Under Strict Japanese Inspection; Barbed Wire Added Along the Railway Line in West Shanghai; Only Three Bridges Passable in Yangtzepoo

The Japanese have added barbed wire along the railway line in West Shanghai. It is rumored that only those traveling without belongings will be permitted to pass; anyone carrying items will be prohibited. The waterway at the Zhongshan Road Bridge's Toyota Cotton Mill in West Shanghai was also blocked yesterday.

Pedestrians Subject to Rigorous Inspection

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," it was learned this morning (the 25th) that, starting Wednesday, the Japanese authorities in the Chinese areas adjacent to the Kunming Road Public Settlement will implement strict measures to inspect all Chinese people crossing the border. While a certain Japanese officer would not disclose any official information on this, he stated that such measures are possible to prevent the movement of terrorists, while foreigners will likely not be obstructed and will be allowed to pass as usual. Simultaneously, it is widely rumored this morning that the Japanese authorities will close off Hongqiao and Jiangwan. One account claims that the Japanese army has erected new barbed wire from Xujiahui, reaching directly to Jiangwan, leading to concerns that the Public Settlement may be isolated from the outside world, similar to the restrictions imposed on Tianjin last year. This is likely not the case.

Most Bridges in Yangtzepoo Closed

According to the "Shanghai Times," the Japanese Naval Command in Shanghai, in order to curb the increasing activity of terrorists in Yangtzepoo, ordered yesterday (the 24th) the indefinite closure of all bridges over the Yangtzepoo Creek, except those on the main thoroughfares of Yangtzepoo Road, Pingliang Road, and Ward Road. It is reported that the Ward Road Bridge will be open from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM daily. Furthermore, Uraji, an employee of the Japanese-owned Shinko Cotton Mill, was attacked by four assailants on Saturday night in Yangtzepoo; his condition remains critical as of last night. It has been revealed that Uraji was shot twice in the abdomen and underwent surgery that night, but has shown no improvement.

### Fresh Pork Butchers Unwilling to Relocate to Central Slaughterhouse

The city's fresh meat merchants, fresh pork slaughterers, and slaughterhouse workers previously organized a temporary joint office to argue against the Municipal Council's leasing of the Hongkou Sazing Road slaughterhouse. They were able to maintain the status quo. However, yesterday, the industry suddenly received a letter stating that all fresh pigs slaughtered in the former Public Settlement's Soochow Creek and Ningpo Creek slaughterhouses will be transferred to the Sazing Road slaughterhouse for slaughter starting September 1st. The status quo will remain for the French Concession, Wangjiadu, and Xujiahui, but usage fees will be increased, and all meat merchants must pay the difference in usage fees. Upon hearing this, the merchants convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, unanimously opposing the measure and continuing to appeal to all sectors. The workshops have also decided to uniformly reject it.

### Clerk Reading Movement; Businesses Unanimously Support; Managers Write Earnest Letters of Recommendation; Lixin Accounting School Donates Free Tuition

Since the launch of the "Reader's Education Fund" and the "Clerk Reading Movement," various sectors of society have enthusiastically supported it, exceeding the enthusiasm of the primary, middle, and high school groups. Reputable tutoring schools that have been operating for many years have sent letters donating free tuition slots, providing aspiring business and industry employees with the opportunity to learn and improve with good teachers and helpful friends.

Important Notes Regarding Application Form Pick-Up

The number of people picking up application forms has increased daily. However, please note the following: (1) Application forms should be picked up in person; mail requests cannot be processed. (2) One application form per person; please do not pick up multiple forms at the same time. (3) After receiving the form, please fill it out and submit it promptly, as the tutoring schools' start dates are approaching. To save everyone's time, we wish to complete all procedures as soon as possible so that you can start school on time.

Lixin Accounting School Donates Ten Slots; Lixin Accounting School, founded by accountant Pan Xulun, has a complete organization and outstanding results. It has also specially allocated free tuition slots for this newspaper. A letter received yesterday stated: "Since commodity prices have been rising, an increasing number of clerks and apprentices are unable to afford education. Recognizing this, your newspaper is organizing a 'Reader's Education Fund' and launching a 'Clerk Reading Movement' to benefit underprivileged working youth. This is truly commendable. Our school has always been dedicated to cultivating and educating working youth, and we have been working hard towards this goal for over a decade. Most of our students are working youth, and we highly approve of charitable education initiatives. We have been providing one hundred reduced-fee slots each semester to assist underprivileged students interested in accounting for many years. To support and respond to your newspaper's 'Reader's Education Fund' and 'Clerk Reading Movement,' we are allocating ten fully free tuition slots (five for elementary bookkeeping and five for advanced bookkeeping) to show our support. We hope that those who aspire to study accounting and have been verified by your newspaper as being underprivileged with high aspirations but unable to afford education will be recommended for admission by letter before September 10th. Please review and respond accordingly."

Store Managers Recommend Clerks

Shao Wenhan, the manager of the Paris Jewelry Store on Avenue Joffre, wrote: "Since your newspaper established the Education Fund, countless hard-working students have been spared from dropping out of school. This initiative is recognized and praised by all sectors. Now, you are continuing to organize a 'Working Youth Reading Movement,' which will undoubtedly receive even more love and support from the entire society. I am confident that your newspaper provides comprehensive service and contributions. Our apprentice, Zheng Hongsen, is not only loyal in his daily work but also very determined to learn. I allowed him to attend the Fourth China Evening Tutoring School last year. He excelled in both academics and conduct at the end of the semester. Now that the fall semester is about to begin, he is almost forced to drop out of school due to his limited financial resources. Fortunately, your newspaper is enthusiastically promoting the Education Movement, so I am recommending him for admission, hoping that he will be accepted and have the opportunity for further study. I am deeply grateful and thank you in advance."

Special Note for High School and College Groups

Most of the education grants for high school and college students announced the other day have already been claimed. A small number of students are requested to immediately notify us of the school they have been admitted to or have decided to transfer to by letter. Those who have already notified us can come to our office to collect the funds and complete the procedures. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.

### Restoration of Ningbo County Parcel and Postal Remittances Rejected by the General Office

Mail between Shanghai and Ningbo has not been restored since the commencement of communications. Ningbo County Postmaster, Mr. Chang, recently came to Shanghai to contact the Administration, requesting the restoration of Shanghai-Ningbo remittances. However, the General Office stated that, as the Ningbo Bank has completely withdrawn and the savings and remittance department of the Ningbo County Post Office has subsequently ceased operations, there is currently no need to restore it, and the request has been rejected. Due to the current poor shipping conditions, there is no room for consideration regarding parcel services, so they will remain temporarily suspended.

### Compilation of a Cost of Living Index for Chinese Staff

— Cai Zhengya

The Municipal Council's Department of Industry and Social Affairs is compiling a cost of living index for Chinese salaried staff. It convened representatives from Chinese and foreign public and private enterprises. Mr. Cai Zhengya gave a speech on the compilation method. Some attending representatives proposed that the manuscript be written and published in the newspaper so that responding families could understand it. We have found the full text and are recording it as follows.

Origin of Compilation

The decision by the Bureau of Industry and Social Affairs to hold a Chinese staff cost of living index is actually due to the urgency of social needs. Commodity prices have been rising in recent times, and not only do the staff members feel the pressure of living, but the employers also want to know exactly how rising commodity prices affect the lives of the staff. Therefore, they have come to ask. The Bureau has already compiled two types of indices: one for the Chinese worker stage and one for Western expatriates, both of which are not suitable for this purpose. Why? The lifestyle habits of Western expatriates are different from ours. The living needs of workers have fewer substitutes, and although staff members have substitutes, such as changing to foreign rice when the price of domestic rice is high, there are things that cannot be saved at the so-called "long gown" stage, and the pain they feel may be even greater. "People, without another index, can't speculate.

How to Compile the Index

The compilation of an index often starts with bookkeeping. Of course, everyone can say how much rice a family of five eats and how many coal balls they need. However, the scientific method is not so simple. It must be proved by facts before there is a basis. The bookkeeping period should ideally be up to a year. Income and expenditure vary with the seasons, for example, at the end of the year, income will increase and expenditure will increase. However, according to the compilation methods of various countries, there are also those that have been reduced to two months, because few people have the perseverance to keep a full year. At present, our people compare and verify the Western expatriate index with accounts for three months and one full year, and the difference is also limited, so it is decided to set it to three months, which is a relatively short period, so that you can see the completion early.

Based on these accounts, the Bureau has calculated the quantity of each item required for clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and checked its rise and fall according to the prices obtained from weekly surveys. It must be based on facts and not on speculation. Therefore, the accuracy of bookkeeping is closely related to the index we compile.

Selection of Items

Please briefly describe the points that should be paid attention to in bookkeeping. The brand names, quantities, values, purchases, or daily use of the items used by each family are different. When compiling the index, each item must be checked one by one, and then sorted according to the number of families purchased, the quantity, the value, the frequency of use, the popularity, and the popularity. To determine the choice. If only a certain amount of food and a certain amount of fuel are recorded in the bookkeeping, it will be useless during analysis. The Bureau has compiled "Bookkeeping Instructions", which includes examples of income and expenditure for reference. For example, if there is more cash in the income of eight, there are also non-cash items, such as rice and coal ball allowances, which should be recorded according to quality and quantity. It is best to indicate the market price, and our office will convert it. In addition, there are also sporadic income, such as old newspapers piled up at home, which take up a lot of space. They are often exchanged for old goods, which is also a kind of income and should still be recorded. In terms of expenditure, for example, if you buy a can of canned food, you must record its name. Brand name. Share. Units, etc., can be checked. As for playing mahjong and dancing for fun, it is a constant thing to regulate the body and mind. The Bureau aims to compile the index this time, rather than investigate the social situation, and there is no need to conceal it. However, there are also those who do not want to express it in writing, so they use terms such as recreation and entertainment as a substitute. The Bureau does not ask how to relax or how to have fun. (To be continued)

### $700,000 Kidnapping Case; Suspects Confess Involvement; King Surname Mastermind Imprisoned in Minhang; Main Suspect Not Apprehended; Hearing Postponed

A King surname, the owner of a woolen shop on Henan Road, lives on Rue Cardinal Fesch in the French Concession. On the evening of April 26th of this year, at 10:35 PM, King left the Liangyu brothel in the Xinhua Alley on Fuzhou Road. When he reached the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road, intending to board his private car driven by chauffeur Jiang Yukun, he was suddenly confronted by several kidnappers who threatened him with guns, kidnapped King, and placed the chauffeur under surveillance. One of the kidnappers drove the car themselves,

Demanding a Ransom in US Dollars

Driving to Room 3 of Apartment 64 in Jingzi Villa on Rue Cardinal Mercier for temporary lodging. They then tied up chauffeur Jiang Yukun in the room and took the kidnap victim King to Minhang Town for imprisonment. They sent a letter demanding a huge ransom. Later, the chauffeur shouted for help and was rescued. The police requested an arrest warrant based on the report. Two months later, representatives from the kidnappers and King's family contacted each other several times. As a result, King was ransomed for US$35,000 (totaling 700,000 French francs). After returning home, King was too frightened and went to Hong Kong for rest.

Suspects Apprehended

It has been learned that the Public Concession police apprehended the suspects in this case, Ningbo native Ying Risheng, Ningbo woman Ying Yan, Ningbo native Feng Furong (aka Little Feng), Zhou Zhifeng, and Wuxi native Mo Rushan (aka Mo Weizhou), in places such as Haig Road on the 20th of this month. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the Special First Court. Concession police attorney Zhang Tianyin prosecuted Ying, Feng, and Huan for kidnapping and extortion. He requested that Ying Yan and Zhou Zhifeng be detained further, as the circumstances of the case are complex and there are still many accomplices at large, and requested permission for a postponement.

Main Culprit Still at Large

The defendant Ying Risheng confessed that the case was initiated by the fugitives King Jiuru and Dong Xinghua. Many people participated. They discussed it somewhere in West Shanghai. At that time, I and Ma Rong each held a handgun. After kidnapping the victim, Feng Furong drove to Jingan Villa first, then imprisoned him in the Wan family's home in Minhang. After two months, they received US$35,000 for ransom and released him. I received 14,000 French francs, which has now been spent.

Each Received Loot

Feng Furong admitted to driving the car and also received 42,000 yuan afterward. Mo Rushan confessed, "I didn't go at the time, just waited for news at the Old East Hotel on Sanma Road because I was listening to Wan's orders. Afterward, I received US$2,200, which has all been spent." Judge Shi verified the confessions and ordered all defendants to be detained. The case was postponed to September 8th for further hearing.

Scholarly Lecture

### Cultivating Sound Reading Habits (2)

— Hu Deling

4.  Utilize Time and Environment

Our reading plan should be formulated based on our own actual situation. In other words, our reading plan should be flexible, not rigid. We should read whenever we have a minute, without fearing that we don't have enough time, or that the environment is bad, or that life is unstable. We should cultivate sound reading habits in insufficient time, adverse environments, and unstable lives, and actively utilize time and environment, seizing every opportunity to read actively. The universe is a great university, society is a great teacher, and opportunities for active reading are everywhere.

5.  Engage in Collective Research

Time is precious, but we should save a tenth of our time to engage in collective research. This doesn't necessarily mean waiting until we have a dozen or five or six people before we can start. At least two people can begin collective research. When two people divide and cooperate on a subject, the results they obtain will definitely be more than what each person could achieve individually, and also better. It not only saves time and energy spent on redundant efforts in the division of labor, but also increases our interest in reading and cultivates our reading habits by discussing academic research questions.

6.  Record Keeping and Life Observation

Record keeping of reading and life observation are also methods for cultivating sound reading habits. They can not only promote our reading habits, but also actively encourage them, preventing us from disrupting them. Keeping reading records is a work full of self-examination, self-criticism, and self-creation. If we can incorporate reading records into our diary entries, its effectiveness will be even more significant. Life observation is equally effective. For example, we can set aside a certain time each day to examine our daily life. As far as reading is concerned, we can simply list six points: (1) What book did I read today? (2) How much did I read? (3) What were the main contents? (4) Did I have any thoughts after reading? What were those thoughts? (5) Were there any unclear or difficult-to-understand points? (6) Were there any doubts? What were those doubts? In this way, we can solidify our reading habits. If we incorporate reading records into our diary entries on the one hand, and set aside time each day to examine our reading matters in life on the other, this means we are automatically learning and automatically encouraging ourselves at the same time. There is no reason why reading habits cannot be cultivated soundly. (The End)

### "No Unauthorized Personnel"

— Xiao Yun

In the mansions of the wealthy, or at the entrances of other important locations, we often see a sign that reads "No Unauthorized Personnel." The stern and aloof expression of the owner conveyed by such places presents an interesting contrast to the "WELCOME" mats commonly seen at the entrances of middle-class homes in foreign countries.

The same phenomenon can often be observed in everyday human life. Some people cling to their inherent prejudices for life, unable to accept any other new ideas. They meticulously protect their narrow, self-contained world and take pleasure in it, fearing the intrusion of new things. They put up a "No Unauthorized Personnel" sign for the entire world.

A segment of the hedonistic bourgeoisie does the same. They indulge in lavish entertainment, seek pleasure at will, and live in a small circle of material enjoyment, ignoring the rest of the real world. They refuse to observe the tragic scenes of society because it would hurt their feelings and disturb their leisurely mood. Therefore, they resolutely reject the intrusion of other ideas, and they also put up a "No Unauthorized Personnel" sign.

Every era has its new trends of thought, and every era also has its stubborn conservatives. New trends of thought are uninvited guests, entering through any door or crack. Some people open their doors wide, laying out a "Welcome" mat at the entrance; others build airtight walls of copper and iron, hanging a "No Unauthorized Personnel" sign outside the door.

"No Unauthorized Personnel" may seem safe and comfortable, but what about the futility of "burying one's head in the sand"?

### Female Slave

— Ping

It was an evening when I stepped onto the quiet Qiqi Road, and the night breeze couldn't help but send chills down my spine.

"Ping!" I suddenly heard someone call my name, so I looked up and gazed around. At a window by the roadside, I spotted a haggard face smiling at me, but I didn't recognize her.

Perhaps it could be called a "chance encounter," for I ended up being her guest, led to her presence.

"Ping! I'm old and faded, you don't recognize me anymore, do you?" she asked me.

"That's right, may I ask who you are?" I really couldn't remember who she was.

"Qiangwei! Do you remember?" she replied.

Oh! Qiangwei, I remembered, she was one of my classmates, and an excellent one at that. But after dropping out of school, it was said that she had fallen to become a "dance hostess"!

"Qiangwei! You are my old classmate," I replied, but I hesitated a little about her being a "dance hostess," not wanting to bring it up.

"Ping! Don't you despise me for being an unchaste woman? Can we still be friends?" she probed, sensing my hesitation. I was quite impressed by her frankness.

For a moment, I couldn't find a suitable answer, only vaguely saying, "No, we are still friends." This sentence seemed to bring her unexpected joy, but the smile couldn't hide the haggard look on her face.

"You are the mistress here, right?"

"I can be considered the mistress here," she replied a little reluctantly.

"How fortunate! To be the mistress here." Actually, seeing her haggard face, I already had some doubts about her "happiness."

"Happy? Please don't say that." Unexpectedly, these words made her eyes turn red.

After that, I had few opportunities to speak. Qiangwei talked on and on about her circumstances since we parted ways. Sorrow controlled her emotions, and tears welled up in her eyes. I couldn't help but feel sorry for her.

Soon, I took my leave. Thoughts surged through my mind. Qiangwei was a pitiful creature. For the sake of her family's livelihood, she had no choice but to sacrifice her future and become a "dance hostess." Later, she was forced to follow this dissolute young man, thus ending her life's happiness. As a result, people mocked her and cursed her. But after hearing the cries of this oppressed woman, I pitied her, I sympathized with her, because she was a female slave bought from the poor by society. This is society's sin and shame.

Afterwards, I almost went to see Qiangwei, when ruthless ridicule and curses had almost driven her to the brink of madness. Although I tried my best to comfort her, it did nothing to heal the wounds in her heart, nor could it alleviate the pain that had penetrated deep into her organs.

That day, I received a letter, part of the handwriting already obscured by tear stains, which read:

"Ping: You are my only friend. Since meeting you, you have almost saved me from the hands of death, so that I could extend my miserable life to this day.

You understand everything about me, you will pity me, sympathize with me. I have already tasted the bitterness of human life to the full. Now I only have a soulless shell left. What value is there in living? Why endure the boundless suffering? ...

Ping! I feel infinite sorrow. I tell you, society is my execution ground, chastity is my shackles, money is my executioner. From now on, I bid you farewell forever. I wish you

Happiness

Qiangwei"

Farewell forever! When I read this letter written in blood and tears, Qiangwei had already ended her tragic life. I hope she will sleep forever in a happy paradise.

Qiangwei is dead! Who will pity her? People only have ruthless ridicule and curses for the female slave bought from the poor by this society, ultimately driving her down the path of suicide. I feel that Qiangwei is too pitiful! Not only did she suffer unjust pain throughout her life, but even after death, she could not escape this unjust accusation!

Whenever I step onto the quiet Qiqi Road, I always remember the pitiful Qiangwei, "Society is my execution ground, chastity is my shackles, money is my executioner." I can't help but shed tears of sympathy for her.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Chapter Twelve: Unexpected Turmoil

Zhang Xiaogouzi, carrying a load of luggage, stood idly by like a stage extra, no longer able to guess when Begonia would finish saying what she wanted to say in her heart. So he simply put the luggage down and squatted on the ground, oblivious to everything, quietly admiring the wild scenery decorated by the heavy snow of the past few days.

"Dad, don't worry, I'll do everything you say," Meibao said, adjusting the navy blue cotton cheongsam she had put on today, her eyes red-rimmed.

"In case that fellow surnamed Shang comes to the school to look for you again, don't be afraid. Just tell him that this matter will be resolved by me and Manager Meng. If he has anything to say, tell him to come to Zhangshu Village..." Begonia suddenly thought of something else just as she was about to leave. "If he keeps pestering you, then just tell Principal Fang about it. Although she's a woman, I think she has a lot of spirit and will definitely be able to deal with him."

"Dad, it's very cold, you should go back quickly," Meibao said, picking up the leather suitcase and urging Begonia to go back.

"If we don't hurry, there won't be any vehicles to hire in Beihe Town later!" Xiaogouzi also stood up from the ground and urged.

Begonia smiled and nodded at them.

"Okay, go now! If Xiaogouzi wants to play in the city for a few days, it doesn't matter if he comes back later, there's nothing to do at home anyway." (194)

### Cable Bridge for Vehicle Transport

— Ke Zhong

In modern warfare, speed is a universally recognized factor for victory. To practice wartime transportation, the United States Army specially used a steel cable bridge instead of the usual pontoon bridges or bridges to transport vehicles across the Yanshan River. This type of cable bridge took only three hours from the start of construction to completion, and could safely transport seven-ton military trucks to the other side. This type of cable bridge is simpler, faster, and more economical than ordinary pontoon bridges, and is also a major revolution in military transportation. The picture shows the situation of trucks being transported across the river.

### Heaven

— Lan Wen

I spent some time under the tutelage of an old pastor when I was young, and I learned some stories that took me to a distant era, a distant place. But a child's imagination is linear, unable to weave brilliant, magnificent pictures. Gradually, God moved further and further away from me.

Our people's blood lacks a bit of religious fervor.

In the days that flew by, I passionately loved many things, but neglected religion. What does a passing white cloud have to do with you?

One day, I walked into the church, just for a strange thought: to see the old pastor with his silver hair. But I was disappointed. The pastor was a young man, his hair was black.

The young pastor didn't like to tell stories. He said, "We must build heaven on earth."

Following the crowd, I walked out; a sentence was turning in my mind, turning incessantly.

Someone is trudging through the desert, someone is running in the mountains, the young pastor has a light in his hand; understanding "What world is this?", they shoulder heavy burdens, choose a difficult road, and pursue an ideal in the vast universe.

The world is therefore lively, history is therefore brilliant, and humanity is therefore eternal.

I don't believe in religion, but I remember the young pastor's words.

Who doesn't want to build heaven on earth?

### Random Notes from Shou Chun's Teapot Studio

Thoughts on Capturing and Releasing Cao Cao (Part 1)

Capturing and Releasing Cao Cao is a commonly performed Peking opera for old male roles, and it is also a play that actors and amateurs alike enjoy studying. I have studied this play myself, and even performed it on stage fifteen years ago, from the court scene to the inn scene. I feel that I am incompetent in every way, but I occasionally have some insights that I dare not keep to myself. Now I write them out for the study of fellow enthusiasts.

(1) In the court scene, the lyrics sung by Chen Gong and Cao Cao are all in "Suo Po Zhe" rhymes, which are very difficult to sing properly. The singing style for old male roles is the old tune and the old score. I have never heard of the Tan style (because Tan Xinpei [the great Tan Xinpei] did not like to sing the court scene much in his later years), and the singing styles in the later scenes of traveling, killing the family, killing Lü Boshe, and the inn are different in flavor. If the court scene is not performed, then the words "capturing and releasing" have no basis. If the court scene is performed, it has the disadvantage of being like a two-piece gown of different colors (a two-piece gown, also known as a Han-style long gown, the upper part is mostly white ramie cloth, and the lower part is mostly light green cooked silk. This kind of clothing was commonly seen more than twenty years ago). This is the tenth question. Yan Jupeng and Tan Fuying often started singing from the court scene when they performed this play, and they changed the singing style a lot, but they also lost the solemn atmosphere. What should be done? Also, the four lines of the opening poem recited by Chen Gong are inexplicable and should be improved. Please everyone study this. (2) In the scene of killing the family, Cao Cao comes on stage first, raising his sword to make a killing gesture. I see that the family members being killed mostly wear blue robes and cover their heads with their sleeves, making it difficult to see their faces clearly. Who are these people? In theory, these are the family members of Lü Boshe, including the aunt whom Cao Cao claimed he wanted to visit in the village, as well as sons, daughters-in-law, daughters, servants, etc. There are dozens of people in the whole family, big and small. Therefore, old actors performing this play specifically ordered old female roles, male roles, female roles, clown roles, and miscellaneous roles to come on stage in their respective colors (that is, the faces, makeup, and costumes are all based on the roles) to a number of up to ten people, for Cao Cao's great massacre, to justify his crime of mistakenly killing many people. By doing this, the audience can easily understand.

### Two Villains on the Silver Screen

— Yi

Among the relatively famous villains on the silver screen today, Wang Xianzai and Hong Jingling are a well-known pair. They both have quite long histories in film. Wang was a veteran villain from the former Star Film Company, and Hong was a basic antagonist from the former Lianhua Film Company. Now they have both been recruited by Guolian one after another to work together, which is a common sight on the silver screen. Wang Xianzai is forty-three years old and has a rather upright appearance, a high nose bridge, a long face, and ordinary glasses, which are his special mark. He recently had a bright red wart removed from his ear, which has made him much more handsome. He likes to smoke famous domestic cigarettes and used to frequent dance halls, but now he goes to the Jinmen Theater with his wife to watch plays and enjoys playing chess and drinking. His first wife passed away long ago, and his current wife, Yuan Zhuru, is also a basic employee of Guolian, specializing in playing typical middle-aged housewives. He only has one daughter, named Wang Wei, who is waiting to be betrothed. She loves drama and is deeply interested in it, and is an actress in the Tianfeng and Huasheng drama groups. In his spare time, Wang chats casually, his attitude is natural, humble, and courteous. He looks younger than his age, and has the appearance of a standard young leading man. He lives at No. 18, Mindeli, Fuxu Road.

Hong Jingling is already forty-seven years old. His skin is darker and shiny. His hair is balding, which makes him look even smoother. His facial features are not unusual, his eyes are not slanted, and his mouth is not crooked, but when he acts, he has an annoying look. He performs joys, sorrows, anger and happiness vividly. He recites Amitabha Buddha and holds eighteen Arhats in his hand, which is a routine matter at all times. In his residence, he displays a "My Buddha Bodhi" compassionate mentality and practices universal relief and does good deeds, benefiting refugees. In addition to acting, he also engages in antique trading as a side business. He usually smokes cigars, eats vegetarian meals, and his clothes are clean and hygienic. He only has one precious daughter, who has long since become a father-in-law. He is accommodating in both Chinese and Western ways, and is amiable and approachable. He often recalls anecdotes from outside the silver screen. He lives at No. 3, Ji Wu Fang, Ximen Road.

Chapter Fifteen: Where Did the Powerful Family Forcefully Take Her?

Tian Hongyu then said to the four maids, "You must carefully support this Miss Chen to the painted boat, and serve her by her side, not allowing her to leave even an inch." He then said to Yuanyuan, "Good girl, don't hesitate anymore! I will never treat you badly, quickly come with me." Hua Hudie also urged Yuanyuan to leave. Yuanyuan was powerless to resist and could only reluctantly agree with tears in her eyes. She was slowly escorted down the emerald building by the four maids. As for the suitcases, she didn't even have time to hand them over. Hua Hudie took the initiative to take them away, carrying the two boxes that were placed outside. One of them was the one she had prepared last night. Tian Hongyu was very pleased and went downstairs with Hua Hudie. Yuanyuan really didn't want to go and turned her head every step of the way as she left the courtyard. A painted official boat with lanterns and decorations was already parked by the water. The maids helped Yuanyuan onto the boat. Tian Hongyu and others all got on board. Yuanyuan's foster mother was also escorted to the cabin, tears welling up as she wanted to talk to Yuanyuan, but in front of so many people, it was inconvenient to say anything. She only said "Take care." And Yuanyuan also covered her face with a handkerchief, extremely sad, and dared not sob loudly. Tian Hongyu immediately wanted to set sail, so he urged Yuanyuan's foster mother to go ashore, and then sounded the gong to set sail. With a burst of gong sounds, the painted boat turned around. Just as it was about to depart, Yuanyuan's foster mother and family members were still standing on the shore watching the painted boat, feeling sad. But on the opposite side, a fast boat was rowing towards this way. Standing on the boat was a handsome young man in a Confucian scarf, precisely the pity-jade lyricist. He had prepared at home and came today specifically to meet Yuanyuan, wanting to elope with her. Who knew that the peerless beauty had been preempted by a powerful person and forcefully taken away? When the lyricist saw the painted boat, he was already taken aback. Seeing Yuanyuan's foster mother, the Chen family and their neighbors all standing by the water, but not seeing Yuanyuan, he knew that things were not good. As the boat approached, he didn't even have time to go ashore, but loudly asked Yuanyuan's foster mother on the shore. "Where is Miss Yuanyuan?" Yuanyuan's foster mother didn't even know that the lyricist had come to conspire with her adopted daughter to elope. It was inconvenient for her to tell, so she pointed to the painted boat, meaning that Yuanyuan was in the boat and had been taken away by someone. (152)

### Screen Idol Rudolph Valentino

— Written by Qi Hua

Fifteenth Anniversary of Death

On August 23, 1926, a megastar fell in Hollywood. This was Rudolph Valentino, the star of films such as "The Four Horsemen." This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of his death. He was universally loved by women around the world, and revered as the screen idol of the silent film era, much like modern women worship Tyrone Power. Although Valentino has passed away, he remains an unforgettable figure for American women.

On this day, Hollywood Cemetery specially dispatched extra guards to manage the crowds of women mourners from all over. They silently contemplated the final resting place of this great lover with sorrow. "Many left flowers at the tomb." Fifteen years after Valentino's death, he still captivates and is revered by women. If Mr. Valentino knew, he would surely smile in his grave.
