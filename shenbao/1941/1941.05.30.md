### US President Issues Statement: No Intention to Amend Neutrality Act, Emergency Powers to be Implemented Gradually, Naval Actions May Extend to the Atlantic

Washington – President Roosevelt, while claiming yesterday that he did not intend to request the repeal of the Neutrality Act, avoided discussing whether he would ask Congress to amend it. The President told reporters in Washington that such questions were too delicate to answer. The President also stated that the policies he intended to implement did not conflict with the Neutrality Act's restrictions on American ships entering combat zones. The President would not depart from the fundamental principle. He said that maintaining freedom of the seas also allowed for the prohibition of ships from entering specific ports. The President insisted that, in the history of the current Neutrality Act, Congress indeed wished to retain complete rights over maritime freedom as a traditional American policy, even though it had designated certain combat zones and prohibited American ships from entering them. Regarding the invocation of priority for steel production, the President cited revised government reports indicating that, as a result of increased demand due to the Lend-Lease Act and expanded national defense programs, the steel shortage in 1941 was 1.4 million tons, whereas initial estimates had indicated a surplus of 10 million tons. In 1942, the shortage would reach 6.4 million tons, compared to initial estimates of a surplus of 2 million tons. (Reuter, 29th)

Washington – President Roosevelt announced yesterday that he would implement powers in a gradual manner to fulfill the order issued Tuesday night placing the nation in a state of full emergency. He stated that these actions would be implemented from time to time in the form of announcements or executive orders. The President told reporters that he had no intention of requesting Congress to amend the Neutrality Act, which would prevent the US from transporting raw materials into war zones. Roosevelt also mentioned that priority would be given to steel production because steel production facilities were quite inadequate. Furthermore, he noted that if mediation of labor disputes failed, the government might take further direct action. Well-informed circles yesterday interpreted the President's assurance to Britain as a signal that American naval operations would extend to the Atlantic, or that the "special task force" established to deal with the Axis threat might be deployed. It was also stated that "this American fleet" might consist of battleships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines. They predicted that the fleet's operations at sea would be similar to the British fleet's pursuit of the "Graf Spee." Some sources claimed that the right to open fire first would be given to the Axis powers. If the Axis powers were unwilling to fight a superior fleet, the United States could deliver goods to Britain without a fight. However, they believed that if Axis warships opened fire, the United States would have to retaliate and could transport goods to Britain. Millions of Americans, from New York to Manila, from St. John's Island to Alaska, were vying to seek from the President's eloquent speech what special steps the government would take. The President's speech and the announcement of full emergency powers have heightened national attention to the threat facing the Western Hemisphere. In addition to informing the world that the United States was determined to assist China and Britain at any cost, President Roosevelt stated that the imminent material crisis must be addressed by the nation's utmost strength in national defense production. He said that this must be done at any cost, whether for private individuals or capitalists, for labor or managers. Therefore, the country has now made the following clear policy decisions: (1) Assist China and Britain with raw materials in any way possible; (2) Maintain freedom of the seas; (3) Defend the two hemispheres from all aggression and threats of aggression; (4) Support this policy with force if necessary. The United States must now choose between supporting this policy, even to the point of engaging in war with the Axis powers, or allowing the government's credibility to collapse under the pressure of public opinion. Observers believe that the government will choose the former. (Reuter, 29th)

Washington – President Roosevelt's secretary, O'Leary, told reporters yesterday morning that the President would have a special meeting with reporters in the afternoon. When reporters told him that the President's remarks had caused some confusion regarding the convoy issue, O'Leary replied that he thought the President would clarify it in the afternoon, but he thought the President had already clarified it. A reporter also asked if the President's call for the nation to prioritize national defense should be interpreted as the end of the debate period. O'Leary replied that free speech would indeed continue. He also said that the President's remarks represented 80% of the matter, with 20% left to be announced later. O'Leary also stated that, according to a survey by Columbia Broadcasting System, the number of people who listened to the President's speech exceeded any previous record. It was estimated that there were 65.65 million listeners in the United States, 20 million in Canada, and many listeners in South America and Britain. The White House received an endless stream of telegrams and phone calls, breaking previous records, the number of which was impossible to count. Secretary of State Hull told people that the reaction to the President's speech was very positive, as was the reaction from diplomats in Latin American countries. (Reuter, 29th)

Washington – President Roosevelt met with British Ambassador Halifax and renowned British economist Keynes for two and a half hours on Wednesday. It was heard that the discussions involved American defense production and the general economic situation. Halifax claimed that the issue of taking further steps to escort convoys to Britain was not discussed, as it was a matter for the US President himself. The President informed them how war material production was progressing, which he considered to be extraordinary. (Reuter, 29th)

### Germany Reissues Warning to the United States

Berlin – The German government yesterday "mocked and refuted" President Roosevelt's speech and reissued a warning stating that the "total blockade" of Britain still existed and that any American ships attempting to break through it would be sunk. Reliable sources said, "Germany has no quarrel with the United States, but Germany is prepared to deal with new enemies. Roosevelt's reiterated freedom of the seas was dismissed as one-sided. Roosevelt was also accused of trying to create a "panic situation" and attempting to speak unilaterally on behalf of the Americas. It was also stated that the declaration of a state of emergency would be "the end of American liberalism." (International News Service, 29th)

### Reactions of US Senators and Representatives to the President's Speech

Washington – President Roosevelt yesterday led the United States to the brink of an undeclared war, and he was prepared to fulfill his declaration of unlimited emergency powers. In his eloquent fireside chat, he emphasized that labor strikes and various obstacles must be stopped immediately. He expanded the scope of the aid-to-Britain program and used force to protect the transportation of military supplies to support his declaration. President Roosevelt's assurances exceeded the scope of escorting convoys. His speech elicited different reactions across the country, with some in favor and others in opposition. People across the country, from government leaders to ordinary people on the street, had different views. Minnesota Republican Representative Maas said, "This is what we call war." Texas Democratic Senator Connally called the President's speech a "bugle call to enlist all Americans to do their duty." Ohio Republican Senator Taft said, "The declaration of an unlimited national emergency has no legal effect. The President has no authority to declare such a state of emergency and revoke constitutional rights. Virginia's people considered the President's speech an ultimatum, which was not an exaggeration." Another famous commentator from the Howard newspaper chain, Kreckel, said, "Our America has changed overnight." Thus, after a small wait, President Roosevelt has acquired new powers. The Presidential Palace has been placed in a position to start an undeclared war, or even to wage an undeclared war against the Axis when he deems it necessary. This speech and announcement are no different from the government announcing that a state of war has been established. (Reuter, 29th)

### All Parties in the United States Give High Praise, While Republicans Criticize It

Washington – Congressional criticisms of President Roosevelt's remarks were mixed. Democrats and those in favor of aiding democracies praised it, while Republicans criticized it. The Republican candidate for president in 1936, Landon, who has always advocated non-interventionism, claimed that the democratic system in the United States has now come to an end, at least temporarily. Most Washington newspapers gave it high praise. The Washington Post stated that Hitler is no longer just the enemy of our friends, but also our enemy. New York Times Democrat Senator Glass agreed with every word and sentence in the speech. Georgia Democratic Senator George, who is also Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the speech was a very powerful statement of the government's basic policy. The leader of the isolationists, New York Republican Representative Fish, called it "an excuse for interventionists." North Dakota Republican Senator Nye said, "The President is telling us that we are already escorting convoys." Nevada Democratic Senator McCarran said, "This speech is just another way of declaring war." New York Democratic Senator Wagner said, "The American people, in the face of an unprecedented global crisis, have placed an unparalleled responsibility on President Roosevelt's shoulders. The President has only resolutely accepted it and bravely implemented it." (Reuter, 29th)

Washington – A well-known commentator from the "Scripps-Howard" newspaper chain, Simms, wrote yesterday, "Diplomatic envoys here warn their governments that the United States is now only waiting for the Axis powers to take an 'excessive action' to join the war." Simms said, "This is their interpretation of President Roosevelt's speech and announcement." He also said, "Diplomats believe that the President's move to inform congressional leaders of everything in advance (before the speech) is the closest the President can get to declaring war within the possible scope. Envoys here interpret American policy as similar to an ultimatum. In fact, we are reporting to Rome that the President's decision will have a far-reaching impact on Italy. Italians who heard the speech yesterday morning were shaken by it. It is heard that newspapers and wireless telegraph operators are saying that the United States is not only moving towards war, but also deploying armed forces in key locations to prepare. This is alarming. Italy is awaiting this speech with great concern, not only government officials, but also the public. Therefore, a large number of people listened to the speech in the morning. Generally speaking, this decision will be a blow to Italy. Any Italian should know its importance." Positive reviews continue to come from all over the United States, showing that the people are deeply moved by the speech. The New York Post wrote in large letters, "The President has declared that the Navy will guarantee Dakar, the Azores, and Fortaleza at any time." New York Governor Lehman said that those who fight for their own freedom and the freedom of others will definitely have stronger beliefs and more courage after hearing the President's words. (Reuter, 29th)

New York – The largest labor union in the United States, the "American Federation of Labor," has responded to President Roosevelt's speech and asked all unions to join the federation and to do their best to mediate any disputes in national defense industries, and not to lightly announce strikes unless all efforts have been exhausted. Willkie also gave a speech today, urging American workers, "We cannot be satisfied with just building one plane when the Nazis build one plane, or building one tank when the Nazis build one tank. We must overwhelm the Nazi armories." (Reuter, 29th)

Editorial: The Reaction to President Roosevelt's Speech

After President Roosevelt's historically significant speech two days ago was broadcast, it quickly spread to every corner of the world, causing a variety of different fluctuations and reactions. Briefly speaking, among democratic countries and their people, there was generally a sense of comfort and satisfaction, while occasionally expressing slight regret that Roosevelt did not clearly declare the specific steps to be taken thereafter. In aggressive countries, for the most part, the threatening words of Liddell continued to be heard, but they could not completely conceal their inner fear. Based on this, it can be seen that the attitude declared by the US authorities, even though it aroused the hostility of aggressors, still felt insufficient for those who earnestly hoped that the United States would clearly express its future plans. Regarding this situation, there is a need to further analyze and explain it.

Careful analysis of the various developments in the United States shows that it has long held a firm position on the current situation. In essence, that is to defeat the aggressors and assist democratic countries in achieving victory in the war. This fundamental aspiration of Roosevelt's was declared repeatedly even before the outbreak of the European war. As for its actual implementation, it must adapt to the development of the international situation externally, and adapt to the strength and public opinion of its own country internally. Therefore, it may not always be able to completely satisfy the requirements of some people. If the United States had been able to provide thousands of aircraft to France when France was defeated last summer and Reynaud appealed to the United States, it might have been possible to save the tragedy of Compiègne. The effect would naturally not be comparable to the current support for the British army in the bitter fight, but that was not allowed by the public opinion and national defense production capacity of the United States at that time. From this, we can understand that the US authorities have their own unavailing difficulties, and criticism is only futile. During this year, the United States has made a leap in its political tradition from deciding to do its best to assist democratic countries in the war to declaring the existence of a national emergency, which cannot be considered very fast compared to the various developments in the international situation. However, it has made the greatest effort and loyalty in overcoming internal and external obstacles. Even in Roosevelt's speech the day before yesterday, he not only rebuked the peace fallacies of the isolationists, but also warned the US agencies mediating industrial disputes to do their work early, showing that even when the brink of war has been reached, there are still some internal problems to consider. However, it can be asserted that these problems will not have any strong obstruction or restraint when the critical moment for major decisions arrives. As the United States is speaking in the status of a non-belligerent country, its measures to support democratic countries have reached the maximum extent, and the next step is only to participate in the war. At this moment, the US authorities clearly do not want to put the act of participating in the war ahead of various effective measures, although the existence of the state of emergency has already indicated that the United States is on the eve of war. If aggressive countries must push the United States from the edge of war into the vortex of war, the United States will not only not hesitate, but is also prepared. Although it is already engaged in a disguised war in practice, it is not willing to take on the appearance of war itself in form. This is probably the fundamental belief of the US authorities at this moment. As for how to deliver aid to Britain, whether to adopt convoying or use the recently established "special task force" for reconnaissance, that is a matter for the US State Department to carefully consider, and the method may not be immutable. Since the unlimited state of emergency already exists, President Roosevelt has obtained all kinds of powers except for participating in the war, and it can be imagined that he must have thoroughly planned the future development and steps. Even though he did not make specific declarations in his speech, he can fully exercise his own powers on this point.

It is natural that the firm attitude of the US authorities aroused strong agitation on the Axis side, but it remains questionable to what extent its ability can fulfill Liddell's threats and rhetoric. The sinking of the Bismarck proved that British maritime authority should not be taken lightly, and Germany's attempt to seize dominance of the Atlantic was only a frustrated illusion. Of course, Hitler is unwilling to sit idly by and watch aid to Britain arrive, but its naval strength cannot achieve the effect of completely obstructing it. The goal is difficult to achieve, and instead only leads to the consequence of establishing another belligerent enemy. If the Nazi authorities do not want to act too emotionally, they cannot avoid making major considerations. During the last war, the Imperial German authorities made many efforts to mitigate American participation in the war due to maritime disputes. The Nazi authorities may not be less clever than the Imperial German era. On the other hand, this is naturally the time for the Tripartite Pact, and Liddell's remarks the other day happened to be made to reporters of the Allied News Agency, which was probably not accidental. The tone in Tokyo has been quite fluctuating in recent days, and the long-silent rhetoric has been repeatedly discovered, which can be expected to be the result of a tacit understanding between Germany and Japan in order to deal with the United States. The American President, in his speech, praised China's war effort and promised to give China additional assistance, which was undoubtedly also aimed at the application of the Tripartite Pact. Recently, after the failure of the moderate policy towards China, Britain, and the United States by the Matsuoka faction, the hard-line anti-China and anti-US arguments of the military faction have prevailed again. However, even the large-scale military offensive against China that was launched recently has been trapped in a dilemma, and there is very little realistic significance in extravagantly talking about war with the United States. The sinking of the Bismarck proved that a good tradition is more decisive than the strength of a warship itself. Regardless of whether the tough stance of the aggressive countries is enough to scare the United States, even if it moves from stance to practice, the sum of the forces of democratic countries today to deal with the joint offensive of the allied countries, the number of successes and failures, is not a difficult problem to determine.

### Roosevelt's Failure to Mention Japan is of Great Significance

Washington – According to responsible members of Congress who met with President Roosevelt a few hours before he delivered his radio address two days ago, government officials are increasingly confident that Japan's participation in the Axis powers will soon decline. They cited President Roosevelt's failure to mention the Pacific issue in his radio address as evidence. Their belief is based on news from Tokyo that [a force] now gaining ground is gradually influencing the military clique. Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed his opinion that President Roosevelt's failure to discuss the Pacific issue is of great significance, and he expects that the situation in the Far East will change slightly. (Reuter, 29th)

### Willkie Fully Supports the Policies Announced by the President

New York – Republican leader Willkie last night gave his full support to President Roosevelt's fireside chat on Tuesday night. Willkie prepared a statement saying, "The President has said what we need to hear in excellent language. The President is very clear and correct in his recognition of the economic, social, political, and military impact on the United States after the Nazis defeat Britain. The President has also announced facts that have not been made public before to show that the situation in Britain is serious. Our foreign policy has been announced. Now, whether we are Republicans, Democrats, or New Dealers, we should unite to

### Chongqing Newspapers Enthusiastically Praise Roosevelt's Fireside Chat

Chongqing – This morning, all newspapers published Roosevelt's speech as the top news item and enthusiastically praised it in their commentaries. The Central Daily News said, "The American head of state has made a final decision, and the United States' defense of freedom has also reached a final juncture. Before the publication of this speech, the United States was only an arsenal of democratic countries. After the publication, we believe that the United States has entered a period of full action. If the United States is not conquered, the resistance of China and Britain will not fail. In other words, we firmly believe that China and Britain have obtained a guarantee of victory." It also said, "Roosevelt is one of the greatest politicians in ancient and modern times, and his assumption of the head of state of the United States is both the fortune of the American people and the fortune of all democratic countries in the world." Ta Kung Pao said that after reading this great speech, it can be known that American neutrality has become a thing of the past and has turned to a wartime system, serving as the last bastion of democracy. However, the speech did not specifically mention Japan, which may be mistaken by Japan as an intentional avoidance.

### Italian Commentary on Roosevelt's Speech Remains His Usual Trickery

Rome – Informed sources here last night commented on President Roosevelt's speech, saying that the manner in which the speech was published was somewhat similar to the American election campaign. (As far as Britain is concerned, it is inevitably disappointed with Roosevelt's speech, because the US did not participate in the war, but only declared a state of emergency. The reasons stated by Roosevelt are only for domestic people to listen to, which shows that the anti-war faction in the United States still has considerable efforts. The focus of Roosevelt's remarks is still the threat to the United States if the Axis powers win, and the threat of totalitarianism to Europe. On the contrary, democracy is not the case. Roosevelt claimed that the social reform of the United States has seen progress, but it is contradictory to ignore the progress of social reform in the Axis countries. Roosevelt admitted that the merchant ships lost by Britain exceeded those built by three times, and one time higher than those built by the United States and Britain. As for struggling for maritime freedom, the Axis countries are also fighting for this. In short, the speech is in accordance with Roosevelt's policy of making the Americans believe that the United States must participate in the war. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

Rome – Gedda, the editor-in-chief of American News, commented on President Roosevelt's speech, saying that Roosevelt was selling his usual tricks. In return for Britain's cession of the Western Hemisphere territory, he only expressed his willingness to give Britain assistance, but did not make a specific indication. Roosevelt's decision was not based on Britain's needs, but on the interests of the United States. There are many contradictions in Roosevelt's speech, and the reason is that the interventionist faction in the United States wants to say that its goal is to carry out aggression in the name of defense. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)

### Japanese Newspaper Believes that This Speech Has Removed the Appearance of Neutrality

Tokyo – The Japan Times published an editorial criticizing the American President's speech, entitled "On the Edge of War," saying that the American President's speech had no trace of neutrality, but expressed a firm opposition to Hitler's position, and even made a promise to resist Germany's rights in British territorial waters. The United States has now abandoned the last appearance of neutrality, and the reason for this is not the public opinion expressed by the Neutrality Act, but the President's words and actions. (Reuter, 29th)

Tokyo – Kokumin Shimbun and Hochi Shimbun both criticized President Roosevelt for expressing his intention to provide more powerful assistance to Chiang Kai-shek. Hochi Shimbun wrote, "The United States is now daring to clearly reveal its hostility towards Japan. The United States should be wary of the position Japan now holds, which has been forced to take various effective measures to deal with hostile threats. Kokumin Shimbun said that the United States has shown that it is an enemy of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and Japan cannot stand idly by. Miyako Shimbun urged President Roosevelt to carefully consider the consequences of the United States assisting the Chiang government, which is currently trapped in Chongqing, for the result of this umbrella is only to make many trillions of people in China continue to suffer from the war, otherwise the United States must be responsible for disrupting peace in the Far East. The press heard that the political stench in President Roosevelt's speech was not worth worrying about, because his words were intended to threaten the Axis countries on the one hand, and to incite domestic enthusiasm for participating in the war on the other hand. (Reuter, 29th)

Correction: In the advertisement for Xizhong Futang Pharmacy published in this newspaper, the last word "服" (fú, take) in the eighth line was mistakenly written as "硬" (yìng, hard), the last word "硬" (yìng, hard) in the ninth line was mistakenly written as "瓶" (píng, bottle), and the last word "瓶" (píng, bottle) in the tenth line was mistakenly written as "服" (fú, take). This statement is hereby made to correct the errors.

### Britain Acknowledges the American Public Will Grant the President Discretionary Power

London, Reuters Diplomatic Correspondent: A London spokesperson's comment yesterday that the American President had begun preparing for war summarized the general impression of the President's speech. The British public believes this speech will allow the American people to grant their leader discretionary power. Londoners noted the declaration of freedom of the seas, considering it not only crucial but also evidence of the American President's extraordinary political acumen. This is because the President, amid the public debate over transporting aid to Britain, resolved the dispute with a simple solution—the Lend-Lease Act. The President did not detail escort methods but announced a broad, fundamental policy of freedom of the seas, encompassing all matters related to escorting. Therefore, its importance is far greater than declaring escort details. Predictions within the United States that Axis nations will not welcome the President's speech are considered accurate here, as the speech not only practically guarantees aid to Britain but also analyzes.

### German Foreign Ministry Spokesperson States Speech is Not Surprising

Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry spokesperson commented last night on President Roosevelt's speech, calling it "unmoving." It only discussed the developments of the war and the status of belligerent nations, failing to mention concrete measures to aid Britain. Germany's position has been thoroughly explained by the Führer's speech in the Reichstag and Admiral Raeder's remarks to the Axis Allies. Roosevelt's assertion of maintaining freedom of the seas—that the United States has the right to transport munitions at will—completely ignores the freedom of civilians in belligerent nations to obtain provisions and the protection of neutral countries' trade. As for the recently claimed threat to North America by Germany, it is utter nonsense. Regarding the declaration of a state of emergency, this directly affects the American people, reducing some of their freedoms and increasing the President's power. We have no need to panic. (May 29th, Haitong News Agency)

Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared today that the most important point of President Roosevelt's speech was the declaration of a national state of unlimited emergency. In other words, the U.S. government, to increase Britain's advantage in the war against Germany, will demand greater sacrifices from the American people. It was also stated that Roosevelt later told foreign reporters he had no intention of abolishing the Neutrality Act. Berlin has taken note of this statement but believes it does not seem to align with his speech. (May 29th, Haitong News Agency)

### American Anti-War Group Continues to Fight

Washington: Fifty-five members of the Congressional anti-war group stated yesterday, "President Roosevelt has not yet been absorbed by the pro-war faction, so we are quite encouraged and will continue to fight against the war." These non-interventionists, after a lengthy closed-door meeting, issued the above statement. They further said, "Mr. Roosevelt did not offer millions of voters a meal from a cauldron in his fireside chat. Millions of voters firmly believe in the President's firm promises made during his election." (May 19th, International News Agency)

The telegram was sent to Lu Bigan, Chairman of the New York Committee of the United Relief for China. (May 29th, United Press)

### Soong Tzu-wen Resigns as President of the National Defense League

Washington: Soong Tzu-wen, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of China, announced yesterday that he has resigned from the position of President of the China Defense League. He has already reported the reasons for his resignation to Clark, the secretary of the association. (Editor's note: The China Defense League that Mr. Soong announced his resignation from has absolutely no connection with the China Defense Supplies Corporation based in the United States. The nature of this so-called China Defense League is not clearly understood here. However, according to reliable sources, the association's location is in Hong Kong, and its participants include not only people from various Chinese political parties but also many foreigners. Its nature is like a privately organized research group, aimed at promoting American aid to China in the form of military materials. (May 29th, United Press)

Tokyo: Negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia are reportedly at a "very critical" stage. According to Japanese sources, Foreign Minister Ōhashi requested the Dutch Minister Ba Boqite on May 19th to expedite the economic talks in Batavia. Ten days have passed without a reply. The Dutch East Indies is now adopting an anti-Japanese attitude. The international situation seems to have turned in favor of Britain and the United States. Japanese figures fear that if the Dutch East Indies does not reconsider its attitude towards Japan, the situation may undergo a serious change. (May 29th, Reuters)

Fierce Battle Rages Between British and German Forces on Crete
British Troops Withdraw Voluntarily from Canea, Sea Still Controlled by British Fleet

Cairo: British overseas troops fought desperately in a do-or-die battle on Crete yesterday, trying to block the Nazis. Sources say fierce fighting on Crete is ongoing, especially between Canea and Maleme. New Zealand troops are engaging in hand-to-hand combat with German forces. British reinforcements have been shipped in by sea, while German forces have not used tanks. (May 29th, United Press)

London: According to the latest news from Crete, New Zealand, Australian, and British troops are now fighting shoulder to shoulder on Crete, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. The fighting is intensifying daily. It is reported that German troops continue to pour into the main battle areas around Maleme and Canea. Yesterday, an official in Cairo said that Allied forces had been forced to retreat due to heavy attacks and intense aerial bombardment. Last night, a spokesman for the Cairo headquarters said that this battle was a desperate struggle. A New Zealand officer who had recently returned to Cairo from the island said that the battle was old-fashioned on land but completely new in the air. Dominion troops had to close in on the enemy for close combat. According to the latest reports, the two sides are fighting so closely that it is difficult to see the progress of the battle. There are isolated battles in Rethymno and Heraklion, but the main battle is taking place in the Canea area. British forces are defending a broad front there, constantly under attack from the enemy on land and in the air. The New Zealand officer left in Cairo said that when the German paratroopers first landed and attacked, they looked like lost sheep. London claimed today that Germany had used

London: A Cairo dispatch states that British Empire troops and German forces in Crete are engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat west of Canea, using light machine guns, hand grenades, rifles, and bayonets. German claims that Canea has completely fallen have not been officially confirmed by London. However, several British correspondents in Cairo have telegraphed that British troops have voluntarily withdrawn from Canea. The British War Office says that this withdrawal is not surprising. It is believed that the fighting in the Canea area is among the fiercest seen in this decisive battle. Australian and New Zealand troops, who have been fighting hard for a long time and remain determined, still want to repel the German forces, who are constantly being reinforced with paratroopers and troops carried by planes, but are constantly subjected to bombing. A British spokesman in Cairo said, "This is a fierce, decisive battle." If the German forces occupy Canea, their next target will be the naval base at Suda Bay. However, it is believed that this place is not very useful to either side at present. The German air force is extremely dominant, so it would be too dangerous for the British to use Suda Bay. But even if Germany does occupy it, it will not be of great use, as the British navy still controls the sea and can still prevent any Axis convoys from approaching Crete. In any case, if the German forces want to effectively control Suda Harbor, they must also occupy the Akrotiri Peninsula, which is a broken land rising to 1,000 feet and extending to the south bank of Suda Bay, all the way to Cape Tríbuna. The German landing in Heraklion is also considered dangerous, as the German forces may be able to gather sufficient forces there to attack from the east, which would seriously threaten the British defenses in western Crete. After consolidating their position in Maleme, the German forces are no longer using paratroopers and gliders in that area. They are now only using troop transport planes. London estimates that the German forces are using 1,200 Junkers Ju 52 planes to transport German troops to Crete. At the height of the German attack, one plane was arriving every minute. (May 29th, United Press)

### German Mountain Troops Reach Suda Bay, Italian Troops Land on Crete

Berlin: This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that German warships sank 52,000 tons of enemy merchant ships at sea yesterday, 41,000 tons of which were sunk by the same warship. The Bismarck shot down five British planes on the evening of the 24th of this month and sank a British destroyer on the night of the 26th. In addition, another British ship was hit and caught fire. German mountain troops on Crete are pursuing fleeing enemy troops and have reached Suda Bay, capturing many enemy soldiers. The bay is a British naval base and is now free of British troops. Yesterday, German bombers and dive bombers fiercely attacked British positions in northern Crete, sinking a merchant ship and a patrol boat near the island. German anti-aircraft guns shot down two British bombers. Italian troops have landed on Crete. (May 29th, Haitong News Agency)

London: Military authorities in Cairo stated last night that the battle of Crete is continuing to develop and intensify. The fiercest fighting is in the area between Canea and Maleme. The situation is somewhat unclear, and it is difficult to obtain accurate information. German reinforcements are arriving constantly. The British Empire forces, holding a discontinuous line, are now retreating under German attack. There are enemy sightings in Rethymno and Heraklion. The fighting in these two locations is not coordinated with other areas and is not very important. The main battle is in Maleme. The British Empire forces currently fighting fiercely are mostly New Zealand and Australian troops, with some British troops as well. It was reported yesterday from London that one of the reasons why the British Air Force cannot use bases on Crete is the lack of air defense. The small squadron of British fighter planes moved from Greece to Crete is far fewer than the number of German planes, so it has been withdrawn from the island. It is also reported that Germany has recently reduced its air force stationed in northwestern Europe and transferred a large number of dive bombers and fighters through the Balkans to Greece, a flight distance of 1,200 miles, while British ships transporting military supplies to British troops in North Africa must travel 12,000 miles around the Cape of Good Hope.

### Situation Unchanged on Egyptian Border, No Progress for German Troops East of Mountain Pass, East African Campaign Nearing Completion

London: A dispatch from Cairo last night stated that regarding the second day of the Nazi invasion across the Egyptian border in the western desert, apart from the occupation of Halfaya Pass, there was little change. Most of the German troops are still on top of the mountain pass, with only a few German soldiers appearing across the mountain pass. Therefore, the scope of the military operations currently underway within the enemy territory is difficult to estimate. German troops have not made significant progress east of the mountain pass. German troops are being transported by trucks, with some attached tanks and planes, but not as many as during the invasion three weeks ago. The fighting is now concentrated on a line six or seven miles long south of a location seven miles from the sea. At the same time, the war in Abyssinia is nearing completion. Although it has become more difficult due to continuous heavy rains, it is still progressing satisfactorily. The strength of the Italian army has diminished and it has lost its fighting spirit, especially suffering from British planes and British army fire. The Italian garrison at Daibatate Fort, halfway between Dessie and Gondar, is now surrounded by a large number of patriotic troops. The important activity in Iraq is air raids. (May 29th, Reuters)

It is believed that German casualties are many times higher than British casualties. (May 29th, Reuters)

British Minister Praises Indian and African Colonial Troops

London: General Sir Frederick Ingram, known as the "Father of the Indian Army," and Minister of War Croft stated in the House of Lords yesterday that General Wavell is simultaneously addressing the North African campaign and completing the conquest of Italian East African colonies. Sir Frederick Ingram said that the authorities have not fully praised the outstanding achievements of the officers and soldiers transferred from the Indian Dominions and colonies in the East African campaign, and he feels quite uneasy about this. Most of these troops come from South Africa, India, and various African colonies. Hitler must have ordered Italian Duke Aosta to try to prolong the war as much as possible in order to restrain the British forces in Abyssinia and consume a large amount of their military supplies, but the war in Abyssinia progressed extremely quickly. When the Italian army collapsed, they secretly buried mines and carried out large-scale destruction, but our Indian friends overcame these difficulties quickly and properly, and no army could have done better. Croft enthusiastically endorsed Sir Frederick Ingram's praise of the imperial troops from India and South Africa, saying that the distance from the coast of East Africa to Addis Ababa is extremely far, but in less than a month, the capital of this Italian East African colony fell. The Axis powers' strategy in East Africa was clearly to seize Egypt and the Suez Canal, and to drive British troops out of the Mediterranean, so our first priority was to eliminate the serious threat of Aosta leading a large army of 250,000 to attack us through Sudan and Suez. The victory in the East African campaign will have a decisive impact on the crucial period we are encountering in the Middle East. The army led by Aosta was said to number 300,000, and more than 90,000 of them have been captured by the Allied forces in East Africa, so it is expected that there are currently 17,000 Italian troops in Gondar and 25,000 Italian troops in Chima. (May 29th, Reuters)

### British Ships in the Mediterranean Display Power, Sinking Five Italian Ships, Including a Giant 18,000-Ton Liner, German Ships Off European Coast Heavily Attacked

London: Yesterday's Admiralty communiqué stated that the British Navy has recently sunk an 18,000-ton enemy liner and several other ships. The number of enemy troops and military supplies bound for the North African battlefield that are lost en route is increasing. In addition to the enemy destroyer mentioned in the communiqué of May 23, there are also one troop transport ship with a displacement of 9,000 tons, one oil tanker with a displacement of 7,000 tons, and one giant ammunition ship that were sunk by the British Navy. Another smaller enemy ship was shelled and hit several times. In April, the British Navy intercepted five enemy supply ships sailing south escorted by three Italian destroyers and destroyed them between Sicily and Tripoli. Not only are enemy ships feeling the power of British ships in the Mediterranean, but also ships that the German side has sent to transport supplies along the coast of occupied Europe due to insufficient railway capacity are repeatedly subjected to heavy attacks by the British Air Force during the day. On Wednesday, one German supply ship outside Brest (with a displacement of 5,000 tons), escorted by five armed fishing boats, was attacked by a British Air Force coastal plane and hit by two bombs, gradually sinking. The armed fishing boats all opened fire, but the British plane only sustained two injuries to its fuselage. (May 29th, Reuters)

Chongqing – Central Standing Committee member Wang Faqin passed away at his residence in Chengdu at 7:00 AM on the 28th due to incurable cancer.

It is reported that Wang's remains were placed in a coffin tonight and will be buried in Chengdu temporarily within three days. Wang was a native of Gaoyang County, Hebei Province, born in the 42nd year before the founding of the Republic of China. He joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) in his early years, followed the National Father of the country in the revolution, and was always elected as a member of the Central Executive Committee.

### Those Going Abroad Must Sign Their Names on Their Passports

Chongqing – Relevant sources stated that anyone using a passport should sign their name on the passport. This is a common practice in all countries. The passports issued by our country also have a space for the passport holder's signature. Those who obtain passports to go abroad should sign their names as soon as they receive the passport. However, many Chinese people do not comply with this. Recently, the authorities in Burma have been very strict in inspecting the passports of foreigners entering the country. Many Chinese officials and businessmen traveling to Burma have been detained. The main reason is that the passports they held were not signed by the passport holder. The Burmese side considers such situations to be illegal. In the future, Chinese people going abroad should pay attention to the passport signature regulations. (Dispatch, 28th)

### After the US Export Control Act is Implemented in the Philippines, the Axis Powers Cannot Obtain Oil and Metals; Many Cargo Ships Have Stopped Loading

Manila – The US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, announced at noon today that US President Roosevelt has signed the Export Control Act, extending the export licensing system to the Philippines. From now on, the Axis powers will not be able to obtain metals and vegetable oils from the Philippines. Officials of the Philippine Customs Service have ordered several ships here to stop loading, including the Japanese cargo ship Ikawa Maru, which attempted to load 1,600 tons of iron before the deadline, but ultimately failed. In the first four months of 1941, the quantity of coconut oil, iron ore, manganese, copper, chromium, and hemp transported to Japan broke previous records. Military authorities believe that a large part of it was transshipped to Germany. At the same time, due to the implementation of export controls, President Roosevelt's fireside chat, and Japan's seizure of American goods in Vietnam, the Philippines is also stepping up its defense activities. It is reported that President Quezon will broadcast to the Philippines next week via radio, clarifying the Philippines' position on President Roosevelt's policies. President Quezon said that President Roosevelt's speech was "breathtaking," and therefore it is expected that he will guarantee the full cooperation of the Philippines, making the Philippines a forward post of the American defense line in the Far East. Military circles here said that Japan's activities in Vietnam are a test of whether Washington is too busy paying attention to Europe and can allow the resumption of the southward advance policy. The Philippine Congress is scheduled to convene a special session on June 9 to discuss legislation to adjust the defense of the Philippines and the defense of the United States. At the same time, cargo ships from England have also brought the largest amount of military supplies in the history of the Philippines to supply the American troops. The US garrison in the Philippines is constantly increasing, so additional land has been acquired to provide camps for the newly arrived troops or to build temporary barracks. Troops are exercising daily in the city center of Manila along the city walls, which were used by the Spaniards for defense in the past. (United Press dispatch, 29th)

### Public Concession Water, Electricity, and Gas to Increase Prices Again Starting in July

Electricity to Increase by an Additional 50% Surcharge

Water to Increase to 250%

Gas Usage to be Limited, with Several Times the Fee for Exceeding Usage

The three major public utility organizations in the Shanghai Public Concession, namely the Shanghai Power Company, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, and the Shanghai Gas Company, previously requested approval from the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department (工部局) to appropriately increase monthly fees or limit consumption due to skyrocketing special prices and huge expenses. The Board of Directors referred the case to the Public Utilities Committee for discussion. After the committee convened a regular meeting this Monday to review the reports and original proposals submitted by the respective companies, it found the requests to be justified. It then passed a measure to increase water and electricity fees and limit the consumption of gas. The Board of Directors approved this measure at its regular meeting the day before yesterday, and it is scheduled to take effect on July 1st of this year. However, the people of this city are burdened by the ever-increasing costs of water, electricity, and gas, which places a heavier burden on their lives. It is hoped that the authorities will give it a final consideration, reduce the price and quantity, and lighten the burden on citizens' lives. The details of the various measures are recorded separately below.

Electricity Fee Increase

According to the announcement by the Public Works Department (工部局), the Shanghai Power Company previously submitted a report stating that the prices of materials and water rates continue to rise, which has led to a sharp increase in various operating expenses, making it difficult to cope. Therefore, it requested the approval of the Public Works Department (工部局) to levy a [temporary] surcharge of 50% on the basic electricity fee for all types of users, in addition to the current [fuel] and [exchange rate] surcharges, in order to supplement funds. The calculation of this new surcharge will be based on an exchange rate of US$5.25 equivalent to 100 National Currency (國幣). The amount of the surcharge will be adjusted monthly by the Public Works Department (工部局) and the company in accordance with the current calculation method of the [exchange rate] surcharge.

Prices of All Used Items

Have Skyrocketed

It has been found that almost all of the items used by the company are purchased from abroad, and the increase in electricity fees pales in comparison to the rise in the cost of living in this port. For example, the price of No. 2粳米 (japonica rice) was 9.27 yuan per picul (石) in 1928, but it had increased to 125 yuan by May 2nd of this year, an increase of more than twelve times. Similarly, the price of coal per ton was 12.232 yuan in the same year, but it rose to 175.03 yuan on May 2nd of this year, an increase of more than twelve times. The electricity bill for a typical small residential user, which was 3.08 yuan per month in 1928, is 9.55 yuan this year, an increase of 220%. The electricity bill for a large residential user, which was 25.9 yuan per month in the same year, is 97.55 yuan this year, an increase of 277%. The electricity bill for a small factory, which was 154 yuan per month in the same year, is 635.52 yuan this year, an increase of 313%. The electricity bill for a large factory, which was over 28,000 yuan per month in the same year, is over 123,000 yuan this year, an increase of 471%.

New Surcharge

Has Been Approved

Referencing the comparative table of electricity fees in various foreign ports attached by the company, such as Tokyo, [unclear name], Hong Kong, as well as the French Concession and [unclear name] in this port, it can be seen that the electricity fees charged by the company (including all surcharges, together with the surcharge in this case) are indeed the lowest, except for the French Concession. The case has been thoroughly discussed by the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Department (工部局), and the result is that the company's request to increase prices is in accordance with the chartered business regulations and should be approved. It has been forwarded to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department (工部局) and approved at its regular meeting on the 28th of this month, and will be implemented from the date of termination of the electricity usage period for each user on or after July 1st of this year. The new surcharge only applies to the basic electricity fee, and this is hereby declared.

Water Fee Increase

According to the announcement by the Public Works Department (工部局), the Shanghai Waterworks Company submitted a report stating that the prices of goods have continued to rise recently, especially the costs of fuel and electricity. At the same time, the number of allowances issued to employees has also increased, resulting in a sharp increase in various expenses, making it difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, it attached the budget statement of revenue and expenditure for this year and requested the Public Works Department (工部局) to approve the increase of the water surcharge from 110% to 250% in order to increase revenue, supplement funds, and be able to pay the British gold dividends stipulated in the business regulations and allocate depreciation of the company's assets. The Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Department (工部局) discussed the case and concluded that the company's request to increase prices is in accordance with the provisions of the chartered business regulations and should be approved. It has been forwarded to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department (工部局) and approved at its regular meeting on the 28th of this month, and will be implemented from the date of termination of the water usage period for each user on or after July 1st of this year.

Gas Usage

According to the announcement by the Public Works Department (工部局), the Shanghai Gas Company, in view of the uncertain supply of fuel and in order to prevent gas consumption from exceeding the amount used in the previous year, requested the approval of the Public Works Department (工部局) to implement measures to limit gas consumption. After discussion by the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Department (工部局), it was considered that the request was justified and should be approved. It has been forwarded to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department (工部局) and approved at its meeting on the 18th of this month, and will be implemented. The measures are as follows:

New Applications

Will Be Rejected

1.  From June 1st of this year, all new applications for the supply of industrial gas will be rejected. In addition, new applications for the supply of household gas will also be rejected if it is found that there is a need to switch to gas instead of other fuels for economic reasons.

Exceeding the Limit

Will Be Charged Separately

2.  From the date of commencement of gas usage on or after June 1st of this year, the monthly gas consumption of any user shall not exceed the consumption amount of the same usage period in the previous year. If this is not possible, it shall be limited to the consumption amount of the previous period in the current year. If this is still not possible, it shall be limited to the amount reasonably required as estimated by the company. When this limit is exceeded, the excess part will be charged as follows: (A) For the first time exceeding the limit (one month), the current rate will be doubled. (B) For the second time exceeding the limit (one month), the current rate will be tripled. (C) For the third and subsequent exceedances (one month), the current rate will be quadrupled. The above measures are of a temporary nature and may be modified or abolished at any time. The company will separately notify users of their monthly allowable consumption. The fees collected in accordance with the above Item 2 will be allocated by the company to a reserve fund for use in ways that are beneficial to users, as agreed upon by the Public Works Department (工部局) and the company.

Electricity and Gas

Minimum Charge

According to the announcement by the Public Works Department (工部局), the Shanghai Power Company and the Shanghai Gas Company have provisions for minimum charges for each user. This measure has recently been considered by the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Department (工部局). According to the Shanghai Power Company, from an economic point of view, this charge measure is indeed necessary. However, in view of the current urgent need for the public to conserve electricity, it is planned to temporarily suspend the above measure during the fuel emergency period, except for large users, even if it causes losses to the company. At the same time, the Shanghai Gas Company argues that this measure should be retained, otherwise it will greatly reduce the company's revenue, leading to the need to increase surcharges to compensate for the shortfall in revenue. The Public Utilities Committee believes that the situations of the two companies are completely different. The Power Company is requesting users who are not subject to power reduction restrictions to voluntarily save electricity due to the abnormal fuel supply, while the Gas Company only wants to prevent gas consumption from exceeding the amount used in the previous year. As far as household users' consumption is concerned, this consumption only accounts for a small portion of the Power Company's power output, while it accounts for about 70% of the Gas Company's gas production. In principle, the previous charging measure should be retained. However, in order to avoid hindering the consumption of savers, this fee amount should be reduced according to the percentage of consumption reduction. Therefore, it is recommended that the minimum electricity fee of the Power Company be reduced to 70% of the current amount, and then adjusted according to the situation. At the same time, the Gas Company's charging measure should be retained, but if consumption is actually reduced, the minimum amount of the fee should also be reduced accordingly. The above recommendations have been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department (工部局) at its regular meeting on the 28th of this month.

### New Appointed Officers of the 4th Marine Regiment of the US, a Total of Ten Field Grade Officers

Since Colonel Howard took over the command of the 4th Marine Regiment of the US Navy stationed in Shanghai, he has been actively rectifying the defenses and strengthening the strength.

They are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the President Coolidge liner of the American President Lines in early June. They include Lieutenant Colonel Asted, Majors Ryderly, Woolf, and Jensen, Captains Blanc, Clayke, Lyme, Roe, and Wagner, and Lieutenants Picked and Shofner, a total of ten people.

### Postal Service to Fengqiao, Zhuji, is Open, Telegraph has not Yet Been Restored

The postal service between Shanghai and various places in eastern Zhejiang, Fengqiao and Zhuji, has been opened. Telegraph equipment is being installed. Although the Ningbo Post Office has been restored, only mail from Ningbo to Shanghai is open, and mail from Shanghai to Ningbo is not yet smooth. However, the post office still accepts mail from Shanghai to various occupied areas in eastern Zhejiang that are lightweight, but the actual delivery is very slow.

### Rice Merchants Ordered Over 10,000 Tons of Tribute Rice, to Arrive Next Month and Be Sold Immediately, Hong Kong Rice and Tribute Rice Have Different Qualities

According to the announcement of the Public Works Department (工部局), recently, various newspapers in this port have expressed opinions on the fact that the French Concession (法租界) Public Works Bureau (公董局) will sell Saigon broken rice at a price of 108 yuan per bag or about 87 yuan per picul (石). In this regard, it should be noted that the only difference between the above price and the price of Yang Rice (Rangoon Special Small Broken) sold by the Public Works Department (工部局) is due to the difference in rice quality. Due to the different nature of the above two kinds of Yang Rice, the asking price is also different in the market of this port. Looking at the following comparison, the facts are obvious: On May 20, Rangoon rice was 104 yuan, and Saigon broken rice was 81 yuan; on May 26, Rangoon rice was 115 yuan, and Saigon broken rice was 93 yuan.

Ordering Tribute Rice

Paying a Deposit in Advance

The Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 mixed broken rice purchased and shipped to Shanghai by the French Concession (法公董局) is handled by the Import Committee in Shanghai and the Export Committee in Saigon, while the French Concession (法公董局) and the Vietnamese government are in a supervisory position to control it. Foreign firms in this port that operate Vietnamese Yang Rice will no longer be able to trade privately with rice merchants in this city, and must join the Import Committee before they can handle the trade of this tribute rice. Therefore, there are currently 40 foreign firms participating in the Import Committee, such as [Dafu Corporation]. This tribute rice is a futures product for June and will not be shipped to Shanghai until between the 1st and 30th of next month. Currently, various grain stores (雜量行) are required to pay a 50% deposit in advance to the Import Committee when ordering tribute rice, and retail rice shops (零售米號) are also required to pay a 30% to 50% deposit to the grain stores (雜糧行) when purchasing. The amount of transactions concluded by each Import Committee foreign firm must be reviewed and filed with the French Concession (法公董局) on a daily basis. According to rice industry sources, the current quantity of tribute rice ordered by various grain stores (雜糧行) from the Import Committee foreign firms is about 10,000 tons or more. As for when this tribute rice will arrive and be sold, it is not yet determined, but the ships sailing from Saigon to Shanghai will take at most twelve days.

Wholesale Price of Hong Kong Rice

Slightly Increased

According to the statistics of the Shanghai Public Works Department (公共租界工部局) on the compensation for each bag of rice returned to Xiangmao Foreign Firm (祥茂洋行) by rice shops (米號家) in this city with less than 224 pounds of rice, the average loss per bag of Yang Rice sold by the department is about one and a half pounds. The price sold by the department to each wholesale rice firm (批發米行) is 122.91 yuan per bag, and the price sold by each wholesale rice firm (批發米行) to each rice shop (米號) is 133.50 yuan, with a profit of 10.059 yuan per bag, which is more than double the 4% profit obtained by the rice shops (米號家). In order to make up for the expenses caused by the lack of rice, the department has specially increased the price of Yang Rice ordered by each wholesale rice firm (批發米行) from the Public Works Department (工部局) from 122.91 yuan to 124.70 yuan per bag from yesterday, an increase of 1.79 yuan per bag, but the price sold to the rice shops (米號) is still set at 133.50 yuan per bag, and the retail price is still 110 yuan per picul (石).

Not Paying for Rice

Taking Sales Rights

The day before yesterday, Xiangmao Foreign Firm (祥茂洋行) [unclear] by order of the Public Works Department (工部局), revoked the right of 33 rice shops (米號) in the two concessions in this port to sell Hong Kong rice at a fair price. According to the reporter of Pingming News Agency (平明社), the reason for their punishment was that they did not follow the ordering procedures and were slow to pay Xiangmao Foreign Firm (祥茂洋行). After it was published in the newspaper yesterday, they rushed to Xiangmao Foreign Firm (祥茂洋行) to request [something]. It is heard that the Public Works Department (工部局) has permitted Tongshang (通商), Futai Xin (福泰新), Jinshengchang (晋盛昌), Yuchengtai (裕成泰), Gongschengchang (公盛昌), Guchangsheng (顧昌盛), Heshungong (和順公), and Taishan (泰山) to restore their profit-making sales of Hong Kong rice. Yesterday, they have paid and delivered goods to the market. Xiangmao Foreign Firm (祥茂洋行) is scheduled to move into its office on June 1, and the new address is on the sixth floor of the Asia Petroleum Company Building at No. 1 The Bund. In addition, according to a letter from Yudafeng Rice Shop (裕大豐米號), the shop has not received a notice from the Public Works Department (工部局) to stop selling Hong Kong rice and is operating as usual.

Striking Workers

Have Resumed Work Yesterday

After a part of the workers of the rice shops (米號) in the two concessions went on strike the day before yesterday, the market was not affected because the shops still had apprentices to work with the shop owners. The strikers sent representatives to the Rice Shop Association (米號公會) in Mao Yi Lane (懋益里), Shanhai Pass Road (山海關路), at 2:00 pm yesterday, stating that they were taking into account the business of the rice shops (米號), and on the one hand, they persuaded all the workers to resume work immediately, and on the other hand, they hoped that the association would quickly respond to the conditions put forward by the workers, so as to avoid a stalemate. Therefore, all the workers of the Rice Shop Association (米號業) resumed work yesterday morning. It is also heard that at 10:20 am on the morning of the day before yesterday, someone drove to Huasheng Rice Shop (華盛米店) at No. 233 Weihaiwei Road (威海衛路) to instigate a strike, and was discovered by Deputy Detective Wang Guanren (王關仁) of Chengdu Road Police Station (成都路捕房), who arrested Tong Xinyi (童心一), Chen Zhioren (陳治仁), Wang Chunyuan (王春元), Li Guangtian (李廣田), Zhu Yifei (朱一飛), Li [unclear] (李[unclear]), Tao Guozhang (陶國章), Xiong Fucai (熊福財), Gu Wangxing (顧王興), Xiong Fangzheng (熊方正), Zhu Senyuan (朱森元), Huang Zhongyuan (黄中元), Wang Qiming (王啟明), Zhou Sichun (周思椿), Shen Jinwen (沈金文), Zhang Zhisheng (張至生), Ma Miaogen (馬妙根), Wang Derong (王德榮), Yan Zhongzheng (岩中正), and Chen Wende (陳文德), a total of twenty people, and took them to the police station (捕房). Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special First Branch (特一院刑八庭). The police station (捕房) lawyer Qian Xun [unclear] (錢恂[unclear]) stated the facts and requested [unclear] for custody. The court approved the custody and postponed the trial for seven days.

Due to the special environment, the people of this city, in accordance with the wishes of the concession authorities, will not hold extravagant ceremonies, but will only mourn the great achievements of these historically significant martyrs for the country and the nation with a somber spirit, and will all remotely worship the souls of the martyrs at [unclear] noon. The authorities of the two concessions, because today is a revolutionary anniversary and the end of the Dragon Boat Festival accounting period for the business community, are afraid that unscrupulous elements will cause trouble, so they have decided to implement joint defense for one day in accordance with the joint defense measures. As for the May joint defense, it will be revoked from midnight tomorrow, but ordinary precautions will still exist to ensure the security and order of the concession.

Youth Federation Statement

Commemorative Significance

Today is the 16th anniversary of the May 30th Massacre. The Youth Federation of this city believes that with the current changes in the times, the changes in the international situation, and the Sino-British relations are also very different from those of today sixteen years ago. Therefore, it specially issued a letter to the citizens yesterday, expounding the commemorative significance. The original text is roughly as follows: Today is the sixteenth anniversary of the May 30th Massacre. Every year today, we always use a sad and indignant mood to commemorate the martyred worker Gu Zhenghong and countless compatriots. But today we no longer use a sad and indignant mood to commemorate it. We have already taken resolute action to avenge the martyred heroes. Our more than four years of fighting, although it is to strive for the eternal freedom and liberation of the Chinese nation, is also to turn the commemorative day of national humiliation into a glorious holiday. Now our struggle has awakened the illusions of the general imperialists. We believe that the tragedy sixteen years ago will never happen again, because the current era has changed, and the international situation has also changed. Countries that did not understand us in the past now understand us. Not only do they no longer use brutal means to oppress us, but they also actively help us. Compatriots, as long as we can work hard and struggle, any difficult cause can be successful. Victory will always belong to us.

The audience in the cinema is mostly farmers and rickshaw pullers.

### Record of a Brain Dissection by Wang Xianli

Last night, I saw a bloody human head in my dream.

Since developing an interest in psychology, I've always liked to analyze my dreams, seeking their roots. Most of the time, I manage to find the source of the dream, relieving a burden in my heart.

Of course, this time was no exception. I was just about to analyze it when I chuckled to myself. Didn't I witness Dr. Su dissecting a human head yesterday? And I watched it intently for two and a half hours!

I had long heard of the advancements in modern medicine, that it had reached the point of being able to dissect the brain. I always regretted not having seen it with my own eyes. Once, I met Dr. Su Ningbo Sheng, the director of the Neuropsychiatry Department of the Red Cross Society, and learned that he could perform brain surgery. I told him about my desire to see brain surgery, and to my surprise, he agreed immediately, saying he would definitely notify me next time he had the opportunity.

The day before yesterday afternoon, a nurse called to inform me that Dr. Su would be operating at 2 PM tomorrow and asked me to come and watch.

I chuckled to myself. Dr. Su was so serious about this operation that he had a nurse call to make an appointment, as if inviting me to dinner or a movie. Great! I would not miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

On the afternoon of the 22nd, at 2 PM, I walked into the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road under the scorching May sun. In the operating room preparation area, I saw Dr. Su Zongsheng, already dressed in white gown and trousers, vigorously scrubbing his arms with soap and a brush at the white porcelain sink. When he saw me, he greeted me with a smile and introduced me to the other two doctors and several nurses. A tall doctor said to me, "Are you not afraid?" I didn't know how to answer for a moment. I勉强勉强 said, "I think I'm not afraid."

Another assistant physician led me into the changing room. I took off my outer clothes, and he put a white cloth cap on my head, covered my mouth and nose with a white cloth mask, and put on a snow-white short gown. I looked at myself in the mirror, looking every bit like a doctor! An imposter doctor.

The lady in charge of the operating room came to the changing room and asked me suspiciously, "Are you really not afraid?" She explained that it was not allowed to watch surgery casually, but since Dr. Su had invited me, it was fine, but "Are you really not afraid?" she asked, her eyes wide open in English. I didn't know what to do. I still answered the same way: "I think I'm really not afraid." The doctor who led me into the changing room嘴角嘴说, "If you're afraid, just tell me." I nodded.

When I came out of the changing room, Dr. Su was still washing his arms. He said that usually before an operation, he always spent more than half an hour washing his arms. After washing with soap, it wasn't enough; he also had to wash with disinfectant. After washing with disinfectant, he had to cut his nails. After cutting his nails, he had to wash again. After washing, he wiped them dry with alcohol and then put on gloves.

Dr. Su asked an assistant to bring the skull model from the office while saying that the patient was a woman in her forties or fifties who had come to see him two years ago, complaining of long-standing trigeminal neuralgia on her right cheek. Initially, he treated her with injections, but injections were not a permanent solution. A week ago, the patient came to him again because the pain was unbearable and she had been unable to sleep or eat for several days and nights. Dr. Su explained that surgery was the only permanent solution, and the patient agreed, her determination reflecting the depth of her suffering.

Half of the skull model's cranium had already been sawn off, with the skull cap connected by a rope, and the mouth could be opened and closed, resembling a horror movie scene. Dr. Su was still washing his hands, instructing an assistant to point out the part of the head he would be operating on and explaining the origin and path of the three sets of nerves that passed through the right cheekbone.

At 2:15 PM, several white-clad angels swarmed the patient from another room into the operating room. We followed behind, and the snow-white operating room was bustling with activity. The patient was completely wrapped in white cloth, already under general anesthesia, and the hair on the right side of her head had been completely shaved. She was sound asleep on the operating table, occasionally snoring.

The operating room was rectangular with a semicircular extension. The semicircular part was entirely fitted with white frosted glass windows to allow light to penetrate. Above the operating table, six bright electric lights were shining. Next to the operating table, there were two trays for gauze, cotton, medicine, and all the surgical instruments, managed by a nurse.

Before the surgery, an assistant physician cut open a blood vessel in the patient's neck and used a drip to infuse her with glucose and saline to prevent excessive bleeding or other accidents. Another nurse sat to the patient's left, monitoring her pulse and blood pressure.

At 2:25 PM, the atmosphere in the operating room was at its most tense. With the help of two assistant physicians and a team of five nurses, and under the gaze of two other doctors and me, this imposter doctor, Dr. Su began operating on the patient's head.

### Food - Rice Hoarders Repeatedly Tried to Stir Up Trouble - Fortunately, the Arrival of Goods Was Continuous, and Their Ambitions Were Not Realized

The price of foreign rice on the market yesterday initially rose and then fell, and the market remained volatile. The price rose by two or three yuan in the morning market and fell by a small amount in the midday market. There were few transactions in the afternoon, and the market lacked momentum. As a result, the price was only one or two yuan higher than the night before. In the early market, due to the storm in the Pacific, the buying interest was quite strong, and the re-export by Japanese merchants and the domestic demand were both active. Hoarders were extremely excited. Small traders immediately raised their prices to as high as 120.05 yuan. Saigon No. 1 rose to 126 yuan, No. 1 to 121 yuan, broken rice to 95 yuan, and Minden to 123 yuan. Siamese No. 2 rose to 119 yuan, 　 rice to 108 yuan, British Yao's Saigon No. 1 to 145.5 yuan to 144.5 yuan, Xiaowen to 141 yuan to 140 yuan, and broken rice to 107 yuan to 106 yuan. However, after the market price rose, actual sales became sluggish. The international storm also did not develop beyond what was expected. Large households and hoarders also had to wait for inquiries after the holiday. Many small floating households took the opportunity to sell at high prices, so the market immediately turned weak. As a result, the closing price for Saigon No. 1 was 124 yuan, No. 2 was 119 yuan, Minden was 123 yuan, 120 yuan, Xiaojiao was 118.5 yuan, 118 yuan, Tokyo broken rice was 111 yuan to 109.5 yuan, and special broken rice was 114 yuan, 93 or 4 yuan. Statistics showed that the market was tight at first and then weak, and the price was still about one or two yuan higher than the previous market. The total transaction volume of spot rice for the whole day was 13,000 to 4,000 bags. There are thousands of tons of original bags of British Huasi.

The Public Works Department's publicly sold rice has also arrived in Shanghai. The Yihua Shipping Company's Dingsheng Wheel transported 10,000 bags from Hong Kong and arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, docking at the Luo Qifu Wharf for unloading. The French company's postal ship B.DE.S. Pierre transported a large batch of foreign rice directly from Saigon and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, docking at the Hongkou Shuntai Wharf for unloading. The exact number will be reported after it is investigated today. (Zu)

Yesterday, many national rice varieties such as thick and thin japonica rice arrived due to the rush for the holiday. Moreover, those porters have limited financial resources and urgently need to sell, so despite the tight supply of foreign rice, the selling intention was very loose. Therefore, although the sales were quite good, the market did not change much, and was even slightly soft. Kunshan fresh japonica rice was priced at 132-3 yuan, Zhongguan was 130 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice were priced at 134 yuan for special grade and 131.5 yuan for ordinary grade. Zhongguan was priced at 130 yuan. The original package was opened with wood.

Due to the rebound in the price of foreign rice, people's hearts are good, and the road ahead is not only becoming more prosperous in shops, but also in the retail appetite for rice carriers, so the market price has been raised by two or three yuan across the board due to the full sale. Hong Kong Tuanli was priced at 115-6 yuan, Weili was priced at 113-4 yuan, Juezhi was priced at 111 yuan, glutinous green beans were priced at 105 yuan, Juezhi was priced at 101 yuan, and national glutinous rice was priced at 115-6 yuan.

### Flour Gradually Increasing

The current foreign flour market is showing signs of improvement. Generally, there is no excitement for speculative trading on the side of the Dragon Boat Festival, and local sales are not lonely. Because the price of rice has gradually rebounded in recent days, people's hearts have been rejuvenated. Those who hold goods often hold on, and the depressed atmosphere of the past has dissipated. The opening price of Golden Dragon flour was 29.9 yuan and 29.85 yuan, once rising by 67 cents, and the subsequent market slightly loose, only opening at 19.7 yuan. The opening price of the Fortress flour was 30.05 yuan to 30.03 yuan. There were 10,000 bags of strong transactions, but the current inventory is full, and the foothold of the market is still difficult to consolidate, and it still cannot get rid of the floating and unstable state. There is no market for wheat. The market is closed for one day for the Dragon Boat Festival today.

### Miscellaneous - Soybeans and Corn - Prices Fluctuate by Half a Yuan

Yesterday's miscellaneous grains and oil cake market remained mediocre. However, the market atmosphere was still enthusiastic during the day, but actual sales were too weak, and the environmental stimulus was not enough to arouse the new excitement of speculators. Therefore, there were no huge changes in various market prices. Due to the lack of soybean stalls in yesterday's soybean market (300 bags of Jiaozhou beans and 100 bags of Guide beans), prices fell by about half a yuan. There was local demand for corn, and the market rose slightly by three to five cents, with 1,000 packets of sales. The recent stack of soybean cakes still has an appetite for absorption, so the kick-the-ball business was quite tight in the first half of the day, and prices once rose by five to six cents. In the second half of the day, the selling pressure increased, and the kick-the-ball was forced to decline. As a result, the fluctuation was only between one and two cents compared to the previous day's market. A total of 44,000 to 5,000 pieces of spot and forward cakes were traded.

There were also 255 bags of beans and 1,290 pieces of soybean cake, all of which were shipped to Singapore today (the 30th).

### Yarn and Cotton: Two Days of Jumps in Cloth Prices Trigger Profit-Taking; Double Horse Reaches a High of 1,460 Yuan; Suddenly Strong Demand for Coarse and Fine Yarn from Hong Kong Merchants

The yarn market, which had risen sharply the previous day, initially rose yesterday, then remained flat, but the trend was still firm. However, after two days of jumps, some of which were as high as 100 yuan, profit-taking was inevitable, and traders then re-entered the market. The market saw three changes in one day. However, the spot yarn business has improved greatly compared to the past. Hong Kong merchants bought around 2,000 bales of coarse and fine yarn, including 510 bales of 20-count yarn. The remaining 2-3 count, Yu Ji, Da Fa 20-count, Yu Cheng herding and 10-count coarse yarn totaled 1,500 bales. This further boosted confidence among various parties. According to the market, some foreign buyers have already emerged, waiting for prices to ease slightly before buying again, which would lighten the underlying pressure. What the inside story is, outsiders of course cannot know. 20-count Double Horse reached a high price of 1,460 yuan and a low price of 1,438 yuan. In the afternoon, with today being the Dragon Boat Festival and the market about to close, gray market trading was scarce.

### Cotton Market Good

The situation with spot cotton is slightly good. This is because spot yarn sales are brisk, and factories, with strong sales of finished goods, will replenish their raw materials, so there is hope for development in both coarse and fine cotton. However, yesterday, with the Dragon Boat Festival approaching, firms lacked interest, and actual transactions were very quiet. Only Middling was traded, opening at 100 pieces at a warehouse price of 420 yuan.

Another report from Shanghai: foreign firms' cotton trading was slightly lively due to the stable yarn market. In addition to continuous small-volume transactions of Brazilian cotton among traders, factories such as Bao Feng also purchased a total of 300 bales of Middling, with current selling prices around 350 yuan. As a result, there is hope for a turnaround in the cotton market.

As a result, closing prices were up or down 32 points depending on the delivery month. Indian cotton remained suspended. It is predicted that the market situation at the opening today will be 2 to 8 rupees higher than yesterday.

### University Graduation Examination Should Be Strictly Enforced; Director Chen Delivers a Speech

(Chongqing, May 29) - Regarding the graduation examination for colleges and universities, Director Chen made a speech to reporters, stating, "The revised graduation examination method for colleges and universities, namely the so-called comprehensive examination system, is only a slight improvement on the original graduation examination method, and it is very simple.

It is not a general examination. Therefore, the comprehensive examination system should be strictly enforced by all schools."

### Guangdong Education Department: Relief for Coastal Schools

(Shaoguan News) - Taishan, Kaiping, Lufeng, Dianbai, Yangjiang, Haikang, Hepu, Chaoyang, and Haifeng counties in Guangdong Province have recently been affected by the war. The public and private primary and secondary schools in these nine counties have all suffered losses. The Education Department has sent personnel to conduct thorough investigations and intends to provide relief through various methods. It is now found that although the counties have been successively recovered, the number of schools suspended due to the war is quite large. In addition to the secondary schools having separate relief measures and being supervised to quickly resume classes, arrangements should also be made to accommodate the primary school students and teachers. The department has also received an order from the Ministry of Education to provide immediate relief. In order to unify the methods, seven relief measures have been formulated: (1) The school buildings and equipment of primary and secondary schools and national schools in townships (towns) that have suffered losses should be repaired and supplemented by county allocations and by supervising the townships (towns) where the schools are located to raise funds. Private schools should be handled by school boards allocating funds to restore classes in the shortest possible time. (2) Schools suspended due to the war, whose school buildings and equipment have not been damaged, should be ordered to resume classes on a specific date. (3) The original principals and teachers should be re-employed in all schools that resume classes. (4) Students who have moved to other places from the war zone with their parents should request to transfer to equivalent primary schools in their relocated locations. (5) In addition to the existing primary schools in various places accommodating as many primary school students withdrawn from the war zone as possible, the county government should increase the number of classes in public and private primary schools as needed to accommodate them. (6) The expenses required for increasing the number of classes, if belonging to township schools, should be allocated by the county or local authorities. Private schools should be allocated by the school boards. (7) In townships threatened near the war zone, mobile schools or itinerant education should be organized by the county to maintain the studies of local children. The above measures have been distributed to the aforementioned county governments for prompt compliance.

Therefore, as a result of discussions among the principals of various schools recently, it has been decided that tuition fees will be increased by 30% to 50% starting from the next semester as a remedial measure. The schools will still be able to decide based on their specific circumstances, and the increased tuition fees will still be used as much as possible to improve the treatment of teachers and staff.

### Li Huitang Talks About South China's Expedition Aspirations: A Group of Nineteen to Depart in February

(Hong Kong, 15th Dispatch) The South China Football Team is embarking on a Southeast Asian expedition. A group of nineteen, led by team leader Chen Jingtao and captain Li Huitang, departed from Hong Kong at 8:30 this morning aboard the "Female Micro" vessel, heading first to Singapore. After playing three matches in Singapore, they will proceed to Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Selangor, Penang, and other cities, with a duration of two months. The expected return is in mid-July. According to Li Huitang's pre-departure statement, he has three aspirations for this trip: (1) Singapore currently has two first-class Chinese football teams, with no shortage of emerging talents whom I (Li himself) have yet to meet. I sincerely hope this trip will discover outstanding individuals. (2) Foreign teams that come to Singapore for football matches often have the pleasant feeling of "good ball skills, good audience, and good referees." Overseas Chinese compatriots support the games, not seeking victory or defeat, but hoping for satisfactory performances with good sportsmanship. I sincerely hope that this good atmosphere in Singapore can return with our team to Hong Kong. (3) Sports development in Singapore is very widespread. In my opinion, comparing football talents between Singapore and Hong Kong, Singapore should be ranked first. Singaporean overseas Chinese children are very fond of sports, lively and robust, truly worthy of being called the new youth of the great era. Furthermore, it is decided that in addition to the team's entire elite, the South China expedition team will also borrow Wei Weiquan, Xu Cheng, and Zhong Yongsen, three major generals from the Eastern Club, making the team's strength even more formidable.

### Zongzi

— Jue Hui

Visiting a friend, I had just pushed open the door when the aroma of ham zongzi permeated my senses!

"Ah... how perfect, how perfect, eat it while it's hot."

Speaking wouldn't cause any harm, eating was the priority.

At that moment, it seemed that life was just a zongzi, all thoughts vanished, and eating was all that mattered. I originally wanted to ask about the matter I entrusted to him, but I was intimidated by his ravenous "eating posture" and didn't dare to speak.

Chewing stopped, he smacked his lips, and then shrugged his shoulders in a somewhat Hollywood-esque manner. "Are you free today?"

In fact, asking that question was equivalent to not asking, he knew very well that I was idle all day long.

"Yes!" I couldn't help but lick my tongue, the taste of ham had indeed been missed for three months, fragrant and crisp.

"Another year easily passes by, it's Dragon Boat Festival again, damn, time flies by so fast!" He temporarily "composed" a "poem", looking utterly moved!

I really couldn't think of anything to say, even searching through the corners of my brain. After a long while, I squeezed out a meaningless sentence that was neither here nor there: "What have you been doing lately?"

"Plenty, plenty," he began to count on his fingers, "Eating tofu at cram schools, flirting in movie theaters, strolling around dance halls, sitting in cafes; or else following women in the park and whistling..." Then a "shush" sound, the aroma of zongzi was tempting.

"You have a strong sense of elegance." I am also "witty" sometimes, and I often consider this "remarkable".

Probably because everyone is from a land of propriety and righteousness, we "socialized" very politely with each other for half an hour before I "opened the skylight." So, I felt myself forcing a smile on my face. "Any progress on the matter I asked you about?"

"Oh--" he fell straight down from the clouds, blinking his eyes, "This... I'm still thinking of a way."

How fortunate! At least he didn't refuse, he "is still" thinking of a way.

Leaving his door, I "vaguely" remembered that when I ate zongzi last year, I also took the "still in progress" reply from his house back to my hometown!

Year after year, there is always zongzi to eat every year.

### Fixed Rice

— Gao Yang

Our director strode into the office. As soon as he entered, he announced:

"Reporting a good news to everyone, we can also order the 'Hong Kong Rice' fixed by the Public Works Bureau, priced at one hundred and ten yuan per dan. Each bag is calculated as one dan and two dou and a half, totaling one hundred and thirty-seven and a half yuan in national currency. Each person can order a maximum of two bags, and a deposit of seventy yuan in foreign currency is required for each bag, but the bags must be returned!"

After a pause, he raised his voice again——

"If anyone wants it, you need to decide today, so I can let my wife handle it."

Then the colleagues became restless, because this was a major matter concerning "the people's food." Everyone felt a sense of relief, as if having asthma, they felt a little better.

But at the time, everyone couldn't decide because they all had to go home and discuss how many bags to order.

In the afternoon, the office became lively again, with everyone discussing. However, some people had rice at home and were willing to give up their rights. So, everyone contacted each other, "Can you let me have the rice under your name?"

"Sir, I'll order four bags!"

"Mr. Shao, I'll order two bags!"

Before long, there were already thirty bags of rice.

The next day, Director Shao came to report the news again, saying that the rice could not be directly picked up from the "foreign firm", or they would have to deliver it. Instead, it had to be handled by a designated "rice store." This work was to be handled by a rice store opened by one of our colleagues (note that it's a colleague).

Of course, none of us objected, as long as we could get the rice! Fortunately, not every rice store belongs to the "vermin class"!

A day later, even more "specific measures" arrived, saying that ×× Rice Store, due to the troublesome procedures and "unmentionable losses," had to come up with the following measures:

(1) Each bag will be calculated based on its actual weight, and a price of one dan and two dou will be charged for the time being, because the size of the incoming packages varies, and there will be losses and gains.

(2) Those who want bags will have to pay a bag deposit of five yuan in national currency first.

(3) Each bag will be charged an additional one yuan in national currency for handling.

But the colleagues suddenly reacted like a tidal wave. The reason being——

"We are all colleagues, and we can buy it outside anyway. Why do we have to bother our friends? Let's withdraw, to save trouble."

Suddenly, sixteen bags were withdrawn!

The first one to make the withdrawal was me - busy writing checks - because the payment was made in cash when the money was collected, but it was all deposited into the bank. To get a refund, I had to write checks.

In this way, we finally ordered the rice, and we also bothered a colleague, but the fifty or sixty yuan earned by ×× Rice Store "cannot be discounted"!

### "Grab One"

— Qishui

A whole day has passed, and I haven't put anything in my stomach.

Ah, my stomach is protesting, crying out in hunger. I hurriedly tightened my belt and shouted, "Be good, just hold on a little longer, just a moment longer, and the 'cheap rice' will be delicious!" So I finally managed to drag my bony legs.

The road is long, and no fuel has been added—a few dollars worth of gasoline. Others burn it for fun, but I can't even afford sesame seed cakes and fried dough sticks. Take a bus? I've already emptied my pockets, I can't.

"Sir, please help! Grab one!" Suddenly, a woman's panting voice, I quickly looked up, the woman was stretching out both hands, posing as if she wanted to run but not. Looking back quickly, a... let's call him a scoundrel, holding a paper bag, had already run very far. The woman sighed, a long one.

"Please help, grab one!" Six words, no different from six bayonets, piercing my every cell?

My stomach is crying out in hunger again, but this time it's crying even harder.

(8) Perceptible Friendship

"You're not Yu Hua, are you also afraid of that scoundrel Yuan Baofan?"

"Only a fool would be afraid of him!" Yu Kun almost jumped straight out of bed. "But since you mentioned Old Liu, I want to ask how he's been lately? You two are both writers, you must have some news!"

Mentioning Liu Yuhua, an unpleasant feeling arose in Qiu Haitang's heart again.

"He's been performing in Shanghai, but southerners love to watch local plays, and Old Liu hasn't been able to make a name for himself yet. Last year, Li Yufang came back from Shanghai and told me that his situation was very bad, and he had even started smoking opium: I immediately wired him two hundred yuan, and also wrote a long letter, urging him to quit smoking and come back to the north as soon as he had the chance, just follow me onstage, and we won't have to worry about not becoming popular. Who knew that after this letter went out for a long time, I never received a reply from him, I guess my words urging him to quit smoking were too strong and made him angry..." Qiu Haitang said this long passage in a row, only then did he feel his strength was a little lacking, but generally speaking, his condition today was indeed much better than yesterday.

"You were being superfluous! How can they sing Tan-style male roles without smoking? If they don't smoke, can they still be considered Tan-style male roles?" Yu Kun couldn't help but tease him like this.

Qiu Haitang also knew that he was trying to distract him from his thoughts, so that he wouldn't add another layer of sadness because of Yuhua, so he immediately shifted the topic back to the main subject.

"Enough idle talk, Second Brother, are you ultimately willing to go or not?"

"Even if I don't want to go, I doubt you'd let me off." Yu Kun's hand was again fumbling in his pocket for his last cigarette, but he ultimately didn't take it out. "Anyway, this kind of demon-subduing and monster-catching task can also be considered my specialty, I'm not afraid of Zhao Sirongkui and that gang of people flying up into the sky!"

However, the reality was not so, when he rushed to Beijing the next day, because several days had already passed, Rongkui, Jin the big guy, and several servants inside and outside Qiu Haitang's house who had been stirring up trouble had already fled and disappeared, leaving only Zhao Si, who had not done anything significant, sitting there guarding the house.

### The Nutritional Problems of Shanghai Residents

— Yangzijiang

Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," under various complex causes such as control, hoarding, and manipulation, the soaring prices of various commodities have undoubtedly posed an extremely serious threat to the lives of its millions of residents. The general public is feeling even more difficult lives due to the severe impact of rising prices. At the same time, the nutritional problems of residents are seriously brewing here.

No matter in which corner, especially in relatively poorer areas, one can always see many people with various morbidities due to malnutrition; this situation is obviously extremely unfavorable to a society.

According to the Public Works Bureau's investigation report, the recent food prices are due to the expansion of control over goods entering Shanghai, resulting in scarce supplies. The supply of aquatic products such as fish has also sharply decreased due to the coastline being blockaded. In addition, hoarding, manipulation, and profiteering have contributed to extremely high prices. According to the Bureau's statistics, besides rice, which need not be discussed, the price of tofu per piece in 1936 (i.e., before the Shanghai Battle) was 0.0072 yuan, but now it has increased fivefold. Green vegetables originally cost only 0.035 yuan per catty, but now they are twice as expensive. Radishes, potatoes, leeks, bean sprouts... etc., which have always been regarded as the most common and basic food, have now risen more than five times. Fresh pork cost only 0.292 yuan per catty in 1936, but now it costs 1.120 yuan. Fresh fish originally cost only 0.163 yuan per catty, but recently they have risen sevenfold. Other foods rich in nutrients such as chicken eggs, lard, and fruits have now been affected by high prices and have greatly reduced the intake of the general public.

Not long ago, the authorities launched the National Nutrition Research Association, which convened experts to study the distribution quantity and value of nutritional elements of general foods such as grains, beans, vegetables, meat, sugar, and lard, in order to meet scientific and wartime needs.

The severity of the nutritional problems of Shanghai residents is obviously greater than in other places, and the urgency of remedial measures is what everyone is concerned about.

The Central Health Administration recently conducted a thorough review of individual nutrition problems at the National Health Conference. And according to scientific methods, it set seven standards for remedying general nutritional deficiencies; these can also be used as a reference for Shanghai residents, and are now specially offered to Shanghai residents for reference: (1) Use more beans and coarse grains, as the overly simple (incomplete amino acids) of rice protein is harmful to nutrition. (2) Vigorously encourage chicken, fish, and livestock farming, so that everyone can enjoy meat foods and improve our lack of animal protein. (3) Promote brown rice and dark flour, improve steaming methods and avoid bad habits such as discarding rice soup, so as to avoid the waste of vitamins and minerals. (4) Eat more vegetables and fruits, if vegetables are to be cooked, it should be for the purpose of sterilizing and removing parasites. It should not be cooked for too long, so as not to reduce or eliminate vitamins. (5) Make more use of sunlight to supplement the deficiency of vitamin D. (6) Within the scope of economic possibility, add oil and fat to adjust food, so as to increase the lubrication of food.

The severity of the public nutrition problem brewing in Shanghai is already undeniable; I hope this will attract everyone's attention. Of course, we cannot ignore the actual situation at this time and place, and merely "talk about food and count treasures", which will inevitably be ridiculed, but within the possible scope, this is not a superfluous proposal.

### Fragments of the Ice Skating Performance: Ever-Changing...Like Heavenly Horses Flying; Painted Faces Take the Stage...Unexpectedly Opera Steps and Lyrics

— Qian Di

Yesterday, the Yong'an Ice Skating Rink held a grand technical performance and a costumed Peking opera to commemorate its third anniversary. This can also be said to be a stimulating and fresh piece of news, a first in Shanghai. By 3:30 in the afternoon, the surroundings of the ice skating rink were already packed, with many male and female ice skating enthusiasts focusing their attention on the empty rink. After a while, the radio reported: "Technical performance begins!" Then, twelve members of the ice skating team wearing yellow shirts and black trousers, formed a long line and entered the rink. The leader was Shen Weihou, a veteran of the ice skating world from over a decade ago, and the audience gave him warm applause.

The performance began!

The whole rink was quiet, everyone watched breathlessly. The first program was "Third Anniversary Commemoration," and all the team members skated around the rink three times. Next were: "Plum Blossom Stakes", "Golden Rooster Hanging Upside Down", "Antarctic Crane Playing", "Lotus Spin", "Hundred Steps Piercing Willow", "Balance Scale", "Bomber", "Cartwheel", "Dragon Gate Formation". Among these performances, Miao Huaiqiu's "Hundred Steps Piercing Willow" and Shen Weide's leadership of "Bomber" were the most brilliant. "Hundred Steps Piercing Willow" started with three people drawing eight-shaped steps with their feet, and then Mr. Miao passed through their legs with a low one-word step. Afterwards, the number of people gradually increased until he passed through twelve people, and the audience shouted loudly: "Good skill!" In addition to the "boom boom" sound made by the ice skating shoes, the "Bomber" also had the national flag of our great Republic of China on the nose of the plane. When the national flag flew in the rink, the audience spontaneously clapped, which showed everyone's inner enthusiasm for loving the country.

The so-called "Costumed Peking Opera" is that the ice skating team members wore ice skating shoes, dressed up as female roles, and played young male roles, actually taking the stage in painted faces, and there were also gongs and drums, and also huqin, which was a different flavor from the performances of famous actors such as "Golden" and "Carlton".

The "Costumed Peking Opera" started at 7:00 in the evening. What they performed was "Battlefield Lovers", with ice skating rink coach Ding Jinfu playing the flag bearer, Zhao Guojie playing Wang Botang, and Miao Huaiqiu playing Dongfang Shi. At the beginning, four team members dressed as flag-waving and cheering people, meeting the audience with various different poses. Shanghai people probably saw for the first time people wearing opera costumes who could not wear boots, but instead replaced them with ice skating shoes. This is not considered strange, the good show is still in the back!

When the flag bearer came out, he held a memorial tablet in his hands, and his ghostly face made the whole audience laugh, and the up-and-down steps in his feet showed his extraordinary skills.

Shen Weide came out with a large knife in his hand, with a swallow step, his feet were flat and his hands straight, his posture was beautiful, he really deserved to be a veteran of the ice skating world.

Miao Huaiqiu's Dongfang Shi came out with a twisting posture, wielding a gun in his hand, delicate and unrestrained, like a gentle dragon breaking free from a rabbit, a heavenly horse flying. Then Zhao Guojie's Wang Botang also came out, his stage steps were very steady, and although his posture with the spear was not as good as that of a Peking opera actor, he also had considerable skill.

Regarding the singing aspect, because I am a layman, I don't like to listen to it very much, I just watched the tricks of playing the gun, and I was quite interested. The gun came and went, the gun went and came, sometimes falling, sometimes rising, giving way on this side, pushing on that side, ever-changing, with many styles. I really doubt how you can have such great skills with ice skating shoes on your feet?

After watching the performance, I thought to myself: "Ice skating, this child's play, is both a sport and entertainment, it gives people great benefits for the health of their bodies and the regulation of their minds."

After famous movie star Deanna Durbin and Vaughn Paul were married, a picture of the newlyweds – the picture shows Durbin cutting the wedding cake to treat the guests, while Paul is full of smiles, his joy in his heart is truly beyond description.

### Symphony of Drama and Film

— Bai Ding

Since Li Hong married Yu Guang, she has been pregnant, so she had to speed up her work in "Where the Soul Returns," which she starred in at Lianhe. At the same time, Yang Xiaozhong's another horror film after "Zombie Revenge" "Tomb Human Slave" is scheduled to be jointly performed by the original cast members Li Hong and Jiang Ming, and they are now looking for a female lead early.

After Ai Wu's article "On the Bad Tendencies of the Ping Opera Circle" was published in the previous issue of Shanghai Weekly, it caused the resentment of all Ping Opera critics in Shanghai due to its distorted content. Yesterday, they specially jointly wrote a letter to Flit, the editor of the newspaper, raising three questions and asking Ai Wu to be responsible for answering them.

Wu Yonggang's "Red in Iron Window" was unanimously praised by public opinion after its premiere. The content of the whole drama completely exposes the deformed phenomenon after the August 13th Shanghai battle, which can be compared with Xia Yan's stage play "Suspended City".

After playwright Yu Ling arrived in Hong Kong, he changed his style and began to write film scripts. The story outline still imitates the principles of "Flowers Splattered with Tears" and "Night Shanghai", depicting the current state of Shanghai. According to his letter to a friend, he said that he will be able to finish the script soon, the film title has not been determined, and the script will be prepared for production by the Xinsheng Company.

It is reported that it is planned to elect two representative works, one representing before the war and one representing after the war, limited to the company's productions. Now the owner of Lianhe, Zhang Yangkun, has authorized the distribution department to plan everything.

### Blood Rain in the Qiong Garden

Chapter Ten: Gongsun’s Sword Qi Initially Emerges, Part One

What was the purpose of this visit? It was nothing more than to expose the dark secrets of that adulterous couple. Firstly, to let Wang Yongtai know the truth of the matter, so that he would not let the house thief go unpunished and suspect good people. Secondly, to take this opportunity to eliminate future troubles for Wang Yongtai, which is why he deliberately chose this date to come. It was rare that the dog-like couple were already in a clandestine meeting, so he could capture them both at once. As for this unexpected turn of events, Ran could not have foreseen it. Since I cannot dare to return the precious sword for the time being, that dog-like couple must not be let off lightly. Although I have no weapons in my hands, my fists alone are enough to deal with them. With this thought, Xu Jing immediately turned around, leaped back onto the wall, and walked silently to the front of He Ji's room. Peeking through the window, he saw Sang Yiqing and He Ji inside the mosquito net, moaning and groaning, seeking the pleasure of the Yang Terrace. Xu Jing's anger grew more intense, his rage escalated, and he used all his strength to push open the first window panel on the left. With a sound, the window fell to one side, and Xu Jing jumped into the room in one stride. Sang Yiqing, hearing the window noise from inside the net, poked his head out and saw Xu Jing standing upright in front of the net, his face full of anger. He couldn't help but cry out "Ah yo!" and shrink back into the net. Xu Jing shouted, "Dog thief! You are so bold as to engage in bestial acts behind the old man's back, do you have no humanity?" Sang Yiqing knew he was in a bad situation and, without time to dress, grabbed a pair of trousers and jumped out of the net naked, trying to escape. However, Xu Jing lifted his leg and kicked him, causing him to tumble and fall to the ground. Xu Jing went over, stepped on him with one foot, and sneered, "Tonight, your doomsday has arrived!" He snatched a waistband from him, tore it in two, and tied up his hands. Sang Yiqing was pleading, "Master Xu, I have no previous grudges with you. Please spare me. Please don't let the old man know, or else both my cousin and I will lose our lives. If you let us go, it will be a great act of kindness, and we will never forget your great virtue. We will enshrine your longevity tablet with incense and flowers, and our rebirth will be granted by you, Master Xu. If you are ever in need, my cousin will show her respect with gold, silver, and jewels, as long as you spare us tonight." Xu Jing ignored him and lifted the curtain with one hand, only to see He Ji covering her lower body with a large cloth, with nowhere to hide on the bed. (76)

### Abstract of the Philosophy of Zealous Practice

— Zong Yu

Service must adapt to the needs of society, adapt to one's own abilities, and adapt to the current environment. If these three standards of service are all met, your service can be roughly determined.

### Li A Mao's Health Mailbox

(Encountered a moralistic gentleman's question) On May 23rd, someone asked, "Is the recent appearance of small pustules on my face after having relations with a dancer related to this contact?" The reply was to have further contact. What is this all about? Isn't it too obscene?

(Answer) In general, the appearance of small pustules on the face of unmarried young men and women is a sign that the body is strong and there is a physiological need for marriage. The cure is simply to get married, and once married, the pustules will disappear. Many people suffer from this, and this mailbox has answered this question several times. Now, this person suspects that the small pustules are caused by having relations with a dancer, which is a big mistake. In fact, it is exactly the opposite. It shows that one encounter is not enough to prevent the appearance of pustules. Therefore, since a relationship has already occurred, it would be good to continue it. This is prescribing the right medicine for the ailment, so what's inappropriate about it? In short, your moralistic views are too deep. A medical perspective is different from an ordinary perspective. A medical perspective is above the waterline. What ordinary people consider obscene, medicine considers very ordinary. For example, when a woman gives birth, a doctor cannot refuse to examine her or deliver the baby because her actions when she conceived were obscene. Please take off your old-fashioned glasses.
