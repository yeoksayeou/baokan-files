### Japanese Troops Retreating from Northern Hunan, Rear Routes All Intercepted by Chinese Forces, Places Like Jinjing and Fulinpu Recovered, Japanese Casualties Exceed 79,000

Chongqing - According to Chinese sources, yesterday when the Japanese army attempted to retreat north and cross the Miluo River, their rear routes were intercepted by powerful Chinese troops. The river was filled with Japanese corpses, destroyed trucks, and drowned horses. Battlefield dispatches stated that the Chinese army is currently surrounding the Japanese army and continuing their annihilation operations. The telegrams of congratulations received by Xue Yue, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese forces in Hunan Province, from public organizations across the country, arrived like snowflakes. Celebrations were held in all major cities. One of the immediate and obvious effects of the news of the victory in Changsha was a sharp drop in prices in Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)

Chongqing - After the good news from the front lines of Northern Hunan arrived here like snowflakes, the whole city rejoiced as if in madness. The sound of firecrackers did not cease throughout the night. According to the latest reports from the front this morning, Jinjing, Fulinpu, Baishui, and Wengjiang have all been recovered. The various Chinese sweeping units have achieved many victories. The Chinese armored units, scattered behind Japanese lines in the Xinqiang River and Miluo River areas, upon receiving news of the Japanese army's general retreat, all rose up to intercept and narrow the encirclement. The Japanese army, in a panic, abandoned their retreat procedures, discarding heavy weapons such as artillery and tanks in a chaotic retreat. They are currently being cut into sections by Chinese pursuit teams on both banks of the Miluo River and are being severely attacked individually. (Dispatch from the 3rd)

Chongqing - According to an announcement by General Xue Yue's headquarters, as of last night, the Japanese army's casualties in the Changsha battle, including those abandoned on the battlefield, totaled 79,500, of which 33,600 were dead. The Chinese army captured a total of 796 Japanese soldiers. (Reuters dispatch from the 3rd)

Changsha - On the morning of the 2nd, Chinese and Japanese forces engaged in a major battle along the Liu, Ci, and Lao rivers east of Changsha. The Chinese army displayed extraordinary courage, directly striking at the core of the Japanese army and killing countless enemies. From the bodies of important Japanese officers, a general retreat order issued by Japanese commander Anami Korechika was found, predicting that the Japanese army would begin retreating on the morning of the 1st. The Chinese forces advanced the timeline, intensifying the narrowing of the encirclement on the morning of the 1st, not allowing the Japanese army any chance of escape. This led to the decisive defeat of their main force and the achievement of this great victory, comparable to the battle two years prior. This is all thanks to the great achievement of cooperation between the military and the people. (Dispatch from the 2nd)

Changsha - The Second Battle of Changsha, which has attracted worldwide attention, saw the Chinese army engaging in bloody hand-to-hand combat with the main force of the Japanese army, which had begun a total collapse, in and around Changsha and its northeastern regions for several consecutive days. The Chinese army has launched a pursuit everywhere, like autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves. All Chinese forces pre-positioned along the Lao, Liuyang, Miluo, and Xinqiang lines have also risen up to intercept. The Japanese army, panicking and hearing the rustle of wind and the cry of cranes, disregarded retreat protocols and fled north. On the morning of the 2nd, the Chinese army again captured the main body of the Japanese army in the Jinjing, Wukou, Changle Street, Fulinpu, and Sanxianqiao areas, capturing many prisoners and supplies. They are currently continuing their pursuit. (Dispatch from the 2nd)

Changde - The battle on the outskirts of Changsha, after weeks of arduous fighting by the Chinese army, was completely decided last night. The Japanese army, lured by the Chinese army to the area south of the Guadao River, north of the Liuyang River, and west of Yong'an City, initially resisted stubbornly, hoping to achieve some success, and occasionally harassed the outskirts of Changsha with small units. However, they were subjected to continuous attacks by strong Chinese forces, resulting in heavy casualties. Furthermore, their retreat routes were completely cut off by the Chinese army, leaving the Japanese army isolated in a corner, running out of ammunition and food, and ultimately abandoning their armor and soldiers, dividing into three routes to retreat north (one along the railway line, one along the highway line, and one along the paths between the railway and highway lines). They are currently being surrounded and severely attacked by Chinese ambush troops. There are no longer any traces of the Japanese army near Changsha. The generals and soldiers of all Chinese units have vowed to kill them all and not allow even a single piece of armor to return north. (Dispatch from the 2nd)

Therefore, the people of the country should be vigilant, no matter how deep the sympathy of foreign aid, the matter of survival still depends on our own strength. (Havas dispatch from the 3rd)

### Military Affairs Commission Issues Summary of Operations for One Week, September 26th to October 2nd

Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that this week (September 26th to October 1st), the eyes of the entire country and the international community have been focused on the Changsha defense battle. The brave soldiers on the Chinese front lines have fought hard for weeks and finally inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese, forcing them to retreat quickly. This is arguably one of the most glorious pages in the history of the Sino-Japanese War, and also the greatest achievement China has achieved in four years of war. The Chinese people have no air of arrogance. The decision of victory or defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, and the stability of the situation in the Pacific, can both be transformed by this battle. We hope that the military and civilians of the entire country will be of one heart and one mind, pooling their wisdom and efforts, and taking steady and orderly steps towards a difficult road. The god of victory and light is smiling and welcoming China. The Changsha defense battle: (1) The motives for the Japanese army's offensive were nothing more than (1) attempting to eliminate the main force of the Chinese army on the Northern Hunan battlefield, (2) attempting to undermine China's repeated declarations of its firm national policy of resisting Japan, (3) wanting to exaggerate its prestige on the anniversary of the Tripartite Pact, (4) attempting to salvage the sorrow of the stalled US-Japan talks, (5) deliberately demonstrating its strength and determination to advance westward, and (6) attempting to destroy the abundant harvest in the Dongting Lake region. (2) The strength used by the Japanese side included the entire 3rd, 4th, and 6th Divisions as the main force, and the majority of the 13th, 33rd, 40th Divisions, and the 18th Independent Brigade as auxiliaries, totaling more than five divisions, reaching 130,000 men. This accounts for one-quarter of its total active duty soldiers at home, and also represents the entirety of its most elite troops on all battlefields in China. (3) The Japanese army's offensive was divided into three routes: the western route, about one division, followed the old railway line, attempting to attack the north side of Changsha; the eastern route, three divisions, passed through Pingjiang, Jinjing, and Chunhua Mountain, attempting to attack the east side of Changsha; and the central route, two divisions, passed through Gangkou, Changle Street, Wukou, and Fulinpu, attempting to attack the northeast of Changsha. In addition, there were dozens of amphibious tanks, dozens of artillery pieces, hundreds of ships, and hundreds of aircraft assisting in the battle, creating a very large force. (4) The battle began on the 18th. The Chinese army met the enemy head-on on the entire Xinqiang River line, killing many Japanese soldiers. Later, according to the planned strategy, they retreated to both banks of the Miluo River. At dawn on the 20th, part of the Japanese army advanced south. The Chinese forces left behind strong units north of the river to begin exerting their power. On the morning of the 21st, they repelled more than 10,000 Japanese soldiers at Guanwangqiao and recaptured Guanwangqiao. (5) From the 24th night to the Ma Fengzui area on the south bank of the Miluo River, a long and winding battle unfolded between China and Japan. On the 25th, the entire line fought with the Japanese all day long near Sanjieqiao, Liqiao, Fulinpu, and Gaoqiao. On the 26th, the Japanese army, which was fiercely attacking south, was stopped by the Chinese on the line from the Laodao River, Muzi Shop, to Chunhua Mountain. At the same time, Chinese forces behind the Japanese had occupied important river-crossing points along the Miluo River such as Wukou, Changle Street, and Xinshi. At this point, the Japanese army felt the pain of being attacked from both front and rear. (6) From the 27th to the afternoon of the 28th, the battle continued on the original positions. The Japanese, feeling extremely bored, imitated the Nazis and used paratroopers, who landed in Dongtun Ferry and Donglu in the eastern suburbs of Changsha, and were immediately all killed. The plainclothes units that entered the city of Changsha were also swept away by the Chinese. (7) On the 29th, the battle became even more intense. Chinese forces gradually encircled the Japanese army attacking south from all sides. On the 30th, they killed two large battalions of Japanese supplies near Sanjieqiao and captured the two important strongholds of Lulin Pool and Yingtian. At this point, the battle situation underwent a major change. (8) By noon on the 1st, the battle had reached the decisive stage. The Chinese troops surrounding the Japanese army gradually narrowed the encirclement and launched an extremely tragic and unparalleled bloody battle. (9) The Japanese army ran out of ammunition and supplies, while the Chinese army was full of morale. Therefore, they engaged in a white-knife melee with the Japanese, causing heavy casualties. At this point, the Japanese momentum was suddenly broken, and the entire line wavered. At about 2:00 AM on the 2nd, they began to break through and fled north in three routes. The Chinese army closely followed the Japanese army in front and behind, carrying out a thorough pursuit. The results of the battle are still being investigated. In addition, the Japanese army in Guangdong also began to stir on the 18th to echo the battle in Northern Hunan. On the West River, the Chinese army successively recovered Chikan, Sanbu, Taishan, and Danshui Port on the 29th, and continued to capture strongholds such as Xuetang Mountain and Shangzhongxiajiaofeng on the 30th. The remaining Japanese retreated to Xinhui. On the North River, the Japanese were also pursued by the Chinese army, and they crossed the river and fled in hiding on the night of the 29th. The Chinese recovered Qingyuan City on the morning of the 30th, killing more than 200 remaining Japanese and capturing many war trophies. (Dispatch from the 3rd)

Editorial

### Observations on Commercial and Industrial Dynamics During the Mid-Autumn Festival

Since the outbreak of war, each Mid-Autumn Festival has passed uneventfully. However, based on observations reported in newspapers this year, the festival seems unusually lively, far surpassing last year's. Indeed, after four years of speculation and hoarding, wealth has gradually concentrated in the hands of a small number of industrialists, merchants, and wealthy hoarders. "Easy come, easy go," extravagant and uncontrolled spending has become the hallmark of the "new rich." Consequently, any business catering to luxurious consumption, regardless of how expensive its goods may be, is thriving and enjoying tenfold profits. Is this extreme hedonism the source of Shanghai's prosperity? However, investing everything in speculation and hoarding cannot last, and the general trend of luxury consumption has followed speculation and hoarding.

Speculation and hoarding have reached a highly unpredictable stage today. Initially, it involved trading actual goods. Later, because fluctuations in spot trading were not significant, and the procedures for delivery were cumbersome and inconvenient for manipulation, there was a shift in speculative psychology. This was reflected in the "futures" of American dollars, the "gold" of Double Horses cigarettes, and the soaring stock prices. Yet, this was not the end. Rice merchants, seeing that rice prices had reached a point where it was difficult to raise them further, began manipulating oil prices. With the merger of rice and oil merchants, oil prices suddenly jumped by hundreds of dollars, and the upward trend continues unabated. Furthermore, funds have been raised to peg foreign exchange rates, causing those speculating on American dollar futures to suddenly lose their basis. Although some have switched to settling in Hong Kong dollars, the speculative mindset believes that without the backing of foreign exchange, the cotton yarn market has become the focus of speculation in recent days. Former short sellers are in a state of exhaustion and can hardly cope. Cotton itself is supposed to be a source of foreign exchange, and there should be no shortage of American, Indian, coarse, and fine cotton. However, other factories besides the British and Chinese factories cannot enjoy this right. Even for the cotton that British and Chinese factories can purchase with foreign exchange, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not be diverted elsewhere, and the unpredictable nature of human hearts makes it difficult to resolve the issue of foreign exchange supply.

Furthermore, with continuous sales in the Dutch East Indies and Hong Kong, speculation seizes the opportunity to enter, and the recent surge in yarn prices has become one of the most sensational events in the market.

Since speculation has become rampant and prices have soared, not only when compared to pre-war levels, but also when compared to prices during last year's Mid-Autumn Festival, everything has increased several times. What was once considered a satisfactory profit of one or two percent is now considered insufficient even with doubled earnings. "Profiteering" has deeply penetrated the psychology of the industrial and commercial sectors, further fueling the upward trend of prices, making it difficult to control. However, upon closer examination, apart from hoarding, the business of shops has declined significantly. The higher the profit, the higher the price, and the more difficult it is to purchase. For four years, there has been no significant price reduction. This year, everything is expensive. The purpose is either to attract customers during the Mid-Autumn Festival or to slightly reduce prices to promote sales because profits have already been high due to frequent price increases. However, based on a substantial observation of Mid-Autumn Festival business, there is only one day left, and I fear that there has not been any fruitful harvest. This shows that the general consumption volume has been greatly constrained by high prices, reducing purchasing power, and reflecting that the livelihoods of most people are difficult and social poverty is increasing.

Furthermore, since the outbreak of war, the psychology of capital flight has been extremely strong. If people cannot purchase foreign exchange, they buy gold; if they cannot buy gold, they buy foreign currency. Gold pounds and gold yuan have made the money exchanges, which specialize in converting foreign currencies, thrive. All speculative transactions are concentrated there, making silver houses and money exchanges products of the times. Conducting business over the phone is the most popular new trading method in Shanghai. Recently, many newly organized banks and limited liability money exchanges have been established. These are all phenomena of abundant idle capital, and we will see what the future holds.

Initially, Chinese and foreign merchants used foreign stocks as speculation, and the buying and selling were incredibly lively. Stock prices also soared, exceeding the face value by six or seven times, and many other stocks reported increases. After the speculative fever for foreign stocks subsided, the collection of Chinese stocks began. Firstly, Chinese factories have benefited from rising prices and have all made substantial profits. Secondly, the general public believes that investing in industrial and commercial enterprises is safer than holding currency, and they also buy Chinese stocks. This is why the stock exchange has been particularly prosperous recently, with prices exceeding face value by two or three times, or at least around one time. However, the most profitable textile and various industrial stocks have limited circulation in the market, so it is still impossible to gain a complete picture of the overall situation of Chinese industry and commerce. The reason why industrial and commercial capital has been difficult to attract in the past is that their stocks are not easily traded. Once invested, they become illiquid assets, difficult to sell, and difficult for those who want to buy. Now that a situation of stock circulation activity has been created, when the situation stabilizes in the future, attracting investment in new businesses will not be as hesitant as before.

In addition, the real estate industry has also experienced unusual development. Although it is impossible to obtain statistics, the open spaces that are usually seen are now filled with houses, and there is no space to be found. The business of selling buildings in separate units is booming, regardless of whether they are new or old. The demands for petty rent and miscellaneous fees are insatiable, often reaching thousands, and the general working class suffers from the oppressive threat, making housing a problem. Those with capital generally regard real estate as the most reliable investment, but many newly built buildings focus on decorating the exterior, are poorly made, and of substandard quality, making the issue of durability a major concern. Once peace is achieved and residents move inward, will the Shanghai real estate industry not repeat the mistakes of the January 28th Incident, with supply exceeding demand? It is still difficult to say now.

Therefore, based on the superficial observations at present, everything is still booming. Let's observe the future trends. Whether it will be as valuable as gold or jade, it is what those engaged in business should pay attention to!

### British and American Far East Military Leaders Hold Important Meeting in the Philippines to Discuss a Wide Range of Unprecedented Issues, Accelerating Aid to China via the Burma Road

Reuters, Manila, 3rd - British Far East Commander-in-Chief Brooke-Popham arrived here by plane at 1:30 PM to hold a three-day meeting with military and civilian authorities here to discuss various British and American issues in the Far East. According to his interview with reporters, the scope of the meeting is wider than ever before. One of the results seems to be increased British-American cooperation to accelerate aid to China via the Burma Road. Those whom Brooke-Popham plans to discuss matters with include Major General MacLeod, Commander of the US Forces in the Far East; Brigadier General Magruder, leader of the US Military Mission to Chongqing; Admiral Hart, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet; Sayre, US High Commissioner to the Philippines; and President Quezon of the Philippines. He is scheduled to return to Singapore on October 6. Brooke-Popham and three aides met with Major General MacLeod, the first meeting since MacLeod assumed command of the US Forces in the Far East. Later, Brooke-Popham told visiting reporters that he was particularly interested in discussing with Magruder various British-American issues concerning China, including adjusting efforts to increase transportation on the Burma Road because there are a large number of goods waiting to be transported in Lashio. The problem is to ensure the delivery of these goods. Brooke-Popham acknowledged the significance of this meeting as closer military cooperation between the ABCD nations, but said that military and political matters would be discussed. Brooke-Popham also said that the current tranquility in the South Pacific is because Japan is now beginning to believe it has been fooled by the Axis powers and recognizes that it is in a dilemma. As a result of the Soviet Union's resistance to Germany, Japan's fear of the Soviet Union has been increasing. Brooke-Popham concluded by saying that the defense forces of Singapore have been repeatedly strengthened. We have been waiting for an attack for several months and believe that our vigilance must not be relaxed in the slightest. Although we are quite strong, we are never complacent about defense and constantly improve it. No one can predict when the Japanese "young officers" will deviate from the track. The British policy in the Far East must be carefully considered to avoid giving Japanese warmongers the opportunity to use propaganda that Britain intends to attack Japan. If they attack, we will inflict a heavy blow, but this war is the last step in our minds, and Hitler is our great enemy.

United Press, Manila, 3rd - Reliable sources said today that British Far East Commander-in-Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham will arrive here from Singapore soon to hold a meeting with US military leaders. He is expected to arrive here before Magruder's military delegation departs for Chongqing. Members of the delegation arrived here yesterday from Honolulu. Since Brooke-Popham's last visit to Manila, the Philippine Army has been incorporated into the US Army, and Major General MacLeod has commanded the US Far East Forces.

International News Service, Downey, California, 3rd - It was announced here today that several British-ordered Vought aircraft will soon be shipped to China. Vought Aircraft said that this type of fighter has a speed of more than 350 miles per hour and can fully cope with bombers in the airspace over the Burma Road. A large number of them are now being shipped to China. The aircraft currently in China cannot fight effectively at the altitude where Japanese aircraft fly.

### Hull Says US-Japan Negotiations Have Made No New Progress; Maintaining Freedom Is the Central Belief of the United States; It Is Up to Japan to Decide What to Do

Reuters, Washington, 3rd - Yesterday, a news reporter asked Secretary of State Hull if there were any new developments in the situation with Japan. Hull replied that there were indeed no new developments of a discernible nature. When asked if he intended to meet with Japanese Ambassador Nomura in the near future, Hull replied that he intended to let the ambassador decide, as he himself had no new ideas. When the reporters entered the reception room, they saw a huge birthday cake with twenty-one candles lit on it, as yesterday was Hull's 70th birthday. After the Secretary of State entered the room, one of the reporters stood up and said that he wished to represent the reporters in extending their best wishes to the Secretary of State, whose enthusiasm and affection were far more brilliant than the candlelight. The Secretary of State then delivered a speech thanking them for their kindness and said that he had served in the government almost continuously for 49 years. One of the most important lessons he had learned from this long period of contact and experience was that politicians and people everywhere must recognize the serious responsibilities that freedom places upon them because they enjoy freedom. They must stand firm to uphold stable government and to seek peace, security, and the wise and selfless implementation of ideals and habits of social progress. The Secretary of State continued, saying that we are now living in a dark age. In such times, we should all devote ourselves to upholding the central belief, the belief in the highest value of the fate of free people and Christian morality. Because we hold this belief, we will gladly respond to the sacrifices needed for the atrocities we are experiencing today. Because we hold this belief, we cannot lose hope, and the lessons that many of us have learned, as I have, will eventually be learned by everyone.

### Ishii's Remarks: Self-Boasting

Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd - Intelligence Bureau spokesman Ishii, when hosting foreign news reporters this morning, acknowledged that the results of the recent battle in Hunan Province might affect the US-Japan talks in Washington. When asked if the impact was unfavorable, Ishii gave an evasive answer, saying, "Ask the US government." Ishii also boasted that the Hunan battle had given the leaders in Chongqing a very serious feeling, as their elite troops were easily defeated. When asked if the rumors that the United States had placed convoys in the Pacific were true, Ishii replied, "I can almost say that this is nonsense."

### Dutch East Indies Military Raw Materials Supplied to the Soviet Union: Japan Says It Cannot Be Ignored

Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd - A Japanese dispatch from Batavia says that according to a report in the Java Bad news, several Soviet merchant ships recently entered Surabaya. Although the purpose of the ships' arrival has not been announced, according to observers, it is believed that the ships will carry military supplies back to the Soviet Union.

Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd - Intelligence Bureau spokesman Ishii refused to comment on the news reported in the morning paper that Soviet ships were in Surabaya, loading a large amount of important raw materials to Vladivostok, saying that the newspapers seemed very angry. However, the Japanese Consul-General in Batavia is still negotiating with the Dutch East Indies authorities to restore trade. At present, trade between the two sides has actually stopped. If the Dutch East Indies authorities do transport a large amount of goods to the Soviet Union, the Japanese government will certainly not ignore the matter. According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, "Kochi Times," well-informed circles in Japan now believe that the Dutch East Indies authorities are implementing the Soviet aid program agreed upon at the Moscow Three-Power Conference. The Dutch East Indies authorities have repeatedly taken anti-Japanese actions recently, which gives these circles reason to believe that the Dutch Far East colony's attitude toward Japan is extremely worrying.

United Press, Tokyo, 3rd - "Kokumin Shimbun" warned the Dutch East Indies today not to transport oil and other supplies to the Soviet Union. The newspaper commented on reports from Batavia that Soviet ships had recently entered Surabaya, loading large quantities of oil and other supplies, saying, "The Dutch authorities have made many excuses to prevent oil from being transported to Japan, but now they are openly transporting aid to the Soviet Union. We really do not know what their real intention is." "Kokumin Shimbun" also said that Japan is adopting a peaceful policy toward the Dutch East Indies, but if the Dutch East Indies, which has no strength and insufficient military equipment, relies on the strength of Britain, the United States, and other third countries to continue to take strong hostile actions against the Axis powers, Japan's southward policy will enter a new stage. Japan has focused its attention on the tense situation of Japan's southern lifeline, and the Dutch East Indies is part of this lifeline.

### Hitler Delivers Broadcast Speech

### China Is Fighting for America and Will Win Final Victory; Fundraising Rally for China Held in New York; Willkie and Others Attend and Deliver Speeches

United Press, New York, 3rd - Federal Social Security Administrator McNutt declared yesterday, "China is fighting for our victory, and China will win victory." McNutt made this statement in a speech to 6,000 Chinese and American people at the "Voice of China" rally held in Madison Square Garden. The rally was hosted by the United China Relief, and Republican leader Willkie was an important figure at the venue. Other speakers included Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih, renowned newspaper commentator Lippmann, and New York State Governor Edison. The speeches were broadcast nationwide. The rally launched a fundraising campaign for $5 million to aid China. McNutt solemnly declared in his speech that the United States should protect its interests in the Far East. McNutt said, "I have been in the Philippines until now, and I have watched China have a total of 300,000 trained officers and soldiers." He praised China, saying, "The East is not as far as the wheels of your car. If China falls, the open door will be closed forever. If the Philippines joins fascist Japan, there will be a barrier reef between us and all five continents. If Singapore falls, the East will become an outpost of totalitarian states. At that time, you will understand how close China is, and understand that the East is your neighbor." McNutt recalled the tragic situation of Shanghai being bombed, which he witnessed four years ago when he traveled there with Admiral Yarnell.

Willkie told the audience that if China fails, the militarism of totalitarianism will control the East and threaten our West Coast as Hitler intends to threaten our East Coast. All the speakers were introduced by Willkie, and New York Mayor LaGuardia was also one of the speakers. Dr. Hu Shih thanked those attending the rally and said that in the past two months, $40 million in Chinese currency has been raised to relieve China. Hu condemned Japan and quoted a Chinese proverb, "When a thousand people point their fingers, one dies without illness." Dr. Hu also said, "As I speak here, my compatriots in Chongqing are setting off countless firecrackers to celebrate the recent great victory of the Chinese army in Changsha." Edison praised China's resistance, saying, "Even the tenacity displayed by the British people when they suffered terrible bombings last autumn cannot be compared to the tenacity and courage of the Chinese people." Lippmann mentioned the upcoming Double Ten Festival, saying, "We are now just beginning to give China a little help, and China has been providing us with powerful help for four years now. Without an independent China in the Pacific to help maintain peace, there can be no peace." Li also emphasized the military importance of Singapore. Performers included Jack Benny and Eddie Cantor, and a thousand Chinese people sang the Chinese marching song "Arise." Guests included Mr. and Mrs. Butler, Mr. and Mrs. Lamont, Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller, Mr. and Mrs. Pfielte, and Roosevelt.

### Soviet Forces Launch Major Counteroffensive and Succeed in the Staraya Russa Area; German Casualties and Material Losses Are Heavy; Marshal Reichenau Pleads for Aid from Home

TASS, Moscow, 3rd - The German 291st Infantry Division, 506th Regiment, known for its fighting prowess, has been defeated by the Red Army led by Frolov. The enemy suffered 600 dead and wounded, and two German tanks, eight artillery pieces, and one truck were destroyed. The Red Army also captured a large amount of military equipment and ammunition.

United Press, London, 3rd - The Daily Mail's Stockholm correspondent reported today that Soviet marines have landed at a stronghold on the occupied coast of the Leningrad area and, after fierce fighting, have gained a firm foothold. Marshal Reichenau used radio to urgently ask Hitler for help to replenish the losses suffered by the German army due to the powerful Soviet tanks breaking out of Leningrad.

Reuters, London, 3rd - The main points of the recent battle situation on the Eastern Front are: (1) The Leningrad garrison's counterattack was successful; (2) The German threat to the Kharkov industrial area in eastern Ukraine is precarious; (3) The German army is simultaneously attacking the Crimean Peninsula. The Soviet Union's midnight communiqué stated, "On October 2, our army engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy along the entire line. On September 30, 20 enemy aircraft were destroyed, and the Soviet army also lost two aircraft." A supplementary announcement stated that the Soviet army's counterattack in the southwest front was successful, and the German army suffered heavy losses in manpower and material. German corpses and destroyed tanks and artillery were scattered on the battlefield. In two days, the German army suffered 2,700 dead, wounded, and captured. The Soviet army seized 41 artillery pieces, 16 anti-tank guns, 17 grenade launchers, 21 machine guns, 7 tanks, and a large amount of military equipment.

Moscow Radio broadcast a special dispatch from the Soviet News newspaper stating that the Soviet army launched a major counterattack in the Staraya Russa area near Lake Ilmen, 125 miles south of Leningrad, recovering four villages and a tactically important mountain. Furthermore, Pravda reported that during continued fierce fighting on the Nepa River, the German army repeatedly attempted to reinforce, but was defeated by the Soviet army and suffered heavy losses.

Reuters' correspondent in Moscow reported that a matter of even greater concern on the Eastern Front is in Ukraine, where German troops are advancing on the Kharkov industrial area in an attempt to weaken Soviet military production. At the same time, they are attempting to invade Crimea. Although the minerals and industry at the eastern end of this peninsula are quite important, and it is a major source of tobacco, if it is lost, it will have a small impact on Soviet morale. However, the German invasion views the peninsula as a land-based military and political objective rather than an industrial objective. The defense of the peninsula depends heavily on the Perekop Isthmus. The German side has claimed to have invaded halfway through the isthmus, but the Soviet side has not admitted it and said that the German army suffered heavy losses on this line. During the Crimean war, the German side will extensively use dive bombers, while the Soviet army can rely on the strong assistance of the Black Sea Fleet to defend Perekop.

### Germany Continues Terror Policy Against Czechoslovakia, 130 Czechs Killed, Detectives Sent Out to Arrest Suspects

New York, 3rd, United Press - According to news from various European capitals, the unrest in German-occupied areas is increasing, especially in Czechoslovakia, where two-thirds of the territory is under martial law. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) reported that 130 people have been executed in Bohemia and Moravia, and more are being killed. According to well-informed sources in Berlin, 30 people were executed in Prague and Brno on Wednesday. Martial law has been imposed in three new regions of the Czech state. Furthermore, an official Berlin gazette denied reports that Irris, the successor to the Czech state who was accused of treason and sentenced to death, had not yet been executed, but the time of Irris's execution has not been announced. According to news from London, Czechs in London have received information stating that the number of people arrested and killed in Czechoslovakia is greater than what has been revealed in the news. German secret police are currently sending out detectives to search extensively in various poor rural areas. It is said that tens of thousands of Czechs are fleeing their homes, as if facing a great calamity, while others wander the streets with no fixed abode, and some hide in the mountains and forests, all trying to avoid being caught by the detectives of Hitler, the head of the German police in Bohemia and Moravia. There are also those who commit suicide out of fear of being arrested, a truly tragic sight. The Berlin German Daily reported that a Dutch-German newspaper had reported that the German military commander had announced the death sentences of four people. Three of them were shot for alleged sabotage and espionage, and another was reportedly executed for shooting a railway employee. Another person was sentenced to death for alleged sabotage, but the sentence was later reduced to life imprisonment. Many other saboteurs and spies were also sentenced to life imprisonment. According to news from Rome, some bandits had disturbed Trama in Greece, but were dispersed by Bulgarian troops.

### Budget Fails, Australian Cabinet Resigns, Fadden Ordered to Form New Cabinet

Canberra, 3rd, United Press - Fadden, who succeeded Menzies as Prime Minister of Australia on August 29th, resigned today due to a vote of no confidence from the Labor Party during the budget discussion. It is believed that Governor-General Gowrie will ask Curtin, the leader of the Labor Party who overthrew Fadden, to form a new government tonight. After the Labor Party voted against Fadden, he adjourned the meeting. The motion of no confidence in the government was proposed by the Labor Party, which attacked the government's delay in levying taxes on low incomes and its promise to increase the pay of soldiers by one shilling. The Labor Party's amendment to the budget stated that the party opposed the unfair methods stipulated in the budget, which violated true equality and sacrifice. After Fadden resigned, Curtin issued a statement saying that the Labor Party would continue the war with all its strength, as the war involved the interests of the "laboring" class more than any other class. He said he would ask the opposition party to join the War Committee.

### Air Battle Between Britain and Germany in the English Channel, 24 Hours This Week, To Exchange Wounded Prisoners of War, German Planes Shot Down During Moonlight Raid on Britain

London, 3rd, United Press - Authoritative sources here say that the fighting between Britain and Germany along the English Channel will cease for 24 hours this week to exchange wounded prisoners of war. Royal Air Force and German aircraft will cease all activity, and soldiers on the west bank of the canal will also cease firing. Except for a few submarines tasked with protecting the wounded soldiers returning to their home countries from concentration camps, all others will remain at various seaports. This matter will be carried out in extreme silence, and no welcomes, flag-waving, or cannon salutes will be allowed.

London, 3rd, Reuters - Before midnight yesterday, German planes attacked Britain under the moonlight and three were shot down. Two of them were shot down while sneaking across the northeast coast of England, and another crashed in the Firth of Forth area. Residents in the northeast also saw a plane catch fire and fall. The German pilots parachuted down and have been captured. Last night, the northeast and southeast were attacked by enemy planes. A city on the southeast coast was bombed heavily twice. Anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, and fire brigades were dispatched to extinguish the fires. The attack on northeastern England lasted for several hours before it ended.

### Six Synagogues in Paris Destroyed, Act of Terrorism

Zürich, 3rd, United Press - Terrorists destroyed six synagogues in Paris between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM, injuring six people. Several synagogues were almost completely destroyed. The seventh attempt to bomb was unsuccessful. The bombings occurred shortly before the Jewish New Year and the Day of Atonement. It appears that the bombings were carried out by the same group of people who visited each synagogue in succession. Violent explosions were heard in six areas. Police say the interiors of the synagogues were heavily damaged, and only the walls remain in several places. The seventh location was spared an explosion because the bomb was discovered in time.

### French Workers Steal Military Supplies, Shot by Germans

London, 3rd, Reuters - The headquarters of Free France in London issued a statement saying that several boxes of explosives were recently stolen from a storage depot in northern France. Subsequently, a German military ammunition train and two freight trains were blown up near Lille. As a result, twenty French railway workers in the city were arrested and shot without trial.

### German-Turkish Trade Agreement to be Signed Soon

Ankara, 3rd, Reuters - According to Turkish officials, the German-Turkish trade agreement may be signed on Monday or Tuesday.

### Fierce Battles to the Death Continue for Four Weeks Around Poltava, Poland, Between Soviet and German Forces

Fierce battles to the death have erupted around Poltava, a southern Ukrainian railway hub from which Soviet troops withdrew two days ago. Although the terrain there is still flat, the German advance on Kharkiv, a major industrial city 58 miles northeast that manufactures tanks, has been slow. Poltava has few factories, and its loss, apart from slightly affecting morale, is of little importance. This area is located in the heart of Ukraine, with beautiful scenery, and is the hometown of the great writer Gogol. Peter the Great defeated the Swedes here, and Pushkin wrote the poem "Poltava," making this place immortal. The area is mountainous, with crisscrossing valleys and roads. At this time of year, the ground is extremely muddy.

The danger to Leningrad remains serious, but the Soviet confidence in defending the city has greatly increased in the past week. Thirteen German infantry divisions, five tank divisions, and three mechanized divisions, which began a major offensive against the city six weeks ago, have mostly been defeated, causing German morale to decline. It is estimated that 100,000 German soldiers attacking Leningrad have been killed or wounded. The Soviet defenders are not content with passive defense and have repeatedly launched counterattacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The support of the Soviet Air Force has also been effective.

In the far north, Soviet troops have repelled German attacks. Reports that Finnish forces have occupied the town of Gaarelia on the isthmus have not been confirmed. Finnish progress is clearly slow due to difficulties in transporting military supplies.

### Fresh Soviet Troops Arrive in Leningrad, Strength Sufficient to Defend, No Need to Worry

The German forces are at significantly varying distances from Leningrad. Although German troops at some locations have approached the city, the German forces along the Gulf of Finland are currently blocked by the fleet. This can be seen from the Soviet claim that there is fighting far to the west of Kronstadt and the German claim that German long-range artillery is shelling Oranienbaum. Kronstadt is located 20 miles west of Leningrad and is an island fortress defending the city. Opposite it is Oranienbaum. The Soviet military newspaper Red Star recently published news acknowledging that at the beginning of the German offensive against Leningrad, the Soviet Union relied only on exhausted troops retreating from the German border and the Leningrad garrison newly mobilized. But now, fresh troops have arrived and are becoming more active. The German forces have not only failed to encircle the city but have often been unable to hold their positions and have been driven back. The current weather and muddy ground are making military operations even more difficult. It is generally believed that Hitler failed to achieve his goal of launching a fierce offensive against Leningrad during the warm season and will now wait until the ground freezes and the roads north of the city are easier to travel on before attempting another offensive. At the same time, the German forces may use bombing to try to weaken the morale of the city's people. However, according to Soviet newspapers, although German bombing has destroyed many houses, it has had no other success. People generally have the impression that the German forces on the Eastern Front have not been as successful in their air attacks as they were in attacking Britain. This is due to the German Air Force's strength being dispersed across multiple fronts and the Soviet Air Force's heavy attacks on German airfields at the front.

### Leningrad Under Snow and Wind, German Advance Will Face Difficulties

London, 3rd, Reuters - A Reuters military commentator said that yesterday's Soviet and German communiqués contained no important reports. The German communiqué repeated the old tune that "military operations are proceeding according to plan," while the Soviet communiqué also stated that there was fierce fighting on all fronts. From this, it is clear that there have been no major developments on either side. It is quite clear that the German advance in the south must have been halted. However, it is not yet clear whether the German commander will make a desperate gamble in the southern sector or launch another offensive in the central sector. It is reported that the weather at the front has deteriorated, and Leningrad has already seen snowfall, which will make mechanized transportation extremely difficult. Although it will be slightly easier to use troops after the ice freezes, the German soldiers cannot withstand the severe cold and lack adequate cold-weather equipment, which will make it very difficult for them to operate. The weather will also hinder air operations to some extent, so the German forces may transfer some squadrons back to Western Europe to resist the increasingly intense attacks by the British Air Force. London has confirmed that the fighting on the Perekop Isthmus in the Crimean Peninsula is fierce, but the German advance has been slow. In the far north, reports that Finnish forces have occupied Petrozavodsk have not been confirmed. However, according to sources in London, as long as Kandalaksha in the north remains under Soviet control, there is no risk of the supply line to Murmansk being cut off. Although the German forces have not publicly acknowledged the seriousness of the situation, they have reprinted articles from Italian newspapers expressing the possibility of long-term Soviet resistance.

### British Field Marshal States that German Winter Offensive Against Soviet Union Extremely Disadvantageous

London, 3rd, International News Service - According to news published by the International News Service in the United States, Field Marshal Lord Ironside expressed his opinion today that a winter offensive against the Soviet Union would face many difficulties. Ironside said that the Soviet Union has many advantages in terms of training, equipment, and clothing in winter warfare. He continued, "Every commander who leads troops to the vast lands of the Soviet Union must feel the difficulty of his responsibility, because of the dramatic changes in temperature and the inconvenience of transportation within the Soviet territory. This feeling will increase with time as the troops advance." Ironside concluded, "The German desire to capture the Soviet Union may be a very big mistake militarily."

### U.S. President and British Prime Minister Send Letters and Telegrams to Stalin, British-American Mission in Moscow, Currently Only Discussing Wartime Supplies

Moscow, 3rd, International News Service - Just as the Three-Power Conference concluded after two days of intense work, Stalin received letters and telegrams from President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill yesterday. The contents of these communications are unknown.

Moscow, 3rd, Reuters - The chief British representative, Lord Beaverbrook, briefly described the progress of the talks between the British-American Mission and U.S. officials to reporters yesterday, saying that goods have been successively arriving in the Soviet Union, and Soviet representatives expressed genuine satisfaction with the British and American products during the conference. When asked by a Reuters reporter if he had mentioned post-war events, Beaverbrook replied that "we are currently only discussing wartime supplies." Beaverbrook and U.S. chief representative Averell Harriman naturally declined to disclose the quantity and type of supplies to the Soviet Union. However, Harriman stated that the import work began at the end of the conference and that several personnel who recently arrived here are currently dealing with the difficult problem of aiding the Soviet Union. Many more will also join. American military officers and American experts like Colonel Faymonville, who are receiving and managing supplies here, will handle many difficult problems to meet various needs. The chief representatives of Britain and the United States both praised the very cordial atmosphere of the Soviet government's hospitality. They dined with important Soviet figures and watched Soviet-produced films. Harriman also said that Beaverbrook was the best person he had ever worked with in his life.

### Soviet Wartime Industry Moved to Safe Areas, Appears to Have Achieved Success

Washington, 3rd, United Press - Government officials here familiar with Soviet progress told a United Press reporter yesterday that the Soviet Union's move of wartime industry from the path of the invaders to safer areas appears to have achieved great success, allowing them to continue production behind the Ural Mountains. These officials also said that this is the most promising aspect of the current stage of the Soviet resistance and that if this continues to be successful, it will have a major impact on the war. It is reported that the Soviet Union is moving large quantities of machinery and skilled technicians to new locations by truck and train to continue working. People recall that during the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese also took this kind of action under circumstances as difficult as those facing the Soviet Union today, and it was very successful.

### Japanese People in America Spying, U.S. Senator Proposes Investigation Committee

Washington, 3rd, United Press - Democratic Senators Gillette and Johnson proposed in the Senate the establishment of a special committee to investigate reports of espionage activities by Japanese and other Axis diplomatic representatives in the United States. Gillette said that American citizens of Japanese descent on the West Coast are currently "doing their best" to expose anti-American activities. These activities are being carried out by Japanese immigrants who now believe that the United States and Japan are about to go to war. Gillette also said that the work of these patriotic Americans is being greatly hampered by the government's lack of interest in this matter. When Gillette spoke of certain groups engaging in pro-Japanese activities, he said, "It is known that most of this destructive conspiracy is caused by the activities of Japanese consuls in Hawaii and the western United States. If these reports are confirmed by investigation, then the Japanese consuls should suffer the same treatment as the State Department gave to the German and Italian consulates." Gillette did not specify which groups or individuals are engaging in anti-American activities, but he said that some groups have reportedly remitted funds to Japan or helped them distribute propaganda films of a promotional nature in the United States. He also said that the Japanese Military Association and the Imperial League near Los Angeles are working closely together. Both groups have organizations throughout the United States. Gillette added that the association has remitted funds to Japan and that members have sworn allegiance to Japan. He also said that the American People's Association has assisted Japanese people in the United States in selling Japanese military bonds and helped them distribute propaganda films sent from the Japanese Army Department to the United States.

### No Peace Until Nazism is Destroyed, President Roosevelt Publishes an Article

New York, 3rd, Reuters - The Miners' Magazine published an article by President Roosevelt, stating that the only possible peace with Hitler is a peace from complete surrender. He also said that most Americans have changed their views on neutrality now that they know what the consequences of Hitler's victory will be. The security and independence of the United States itself are now threatened for the first time, and democratic systems of government and ways of life are also in the same danger. These are all things that are clearly visible now.

### U.S. President Has the Right to Deploy Troops for War, Clearly Stipulated in the Constitution

Washington, 3rd, Reuters - The Chief Legal Counsel of the Treasury Department, Foley, said yesterday in a speech to the Indiana State Bar Association that the President has the constitutional authority to order the Navy to clear Axis raiding ships from the seas and to protect merchant ships carrying cargo to Britain. The Constitution clearly stipulates that if American ships are attacked, the President can order American troops to take hostile action without any permission from Congress.

### Cotton Yarn; Too Many Shorts, Easily Changeable; Cotton Yarn Price Increase Increasingly Acute; Floor Specifically Engaged in Throwing Stones Down a Well; Double Horse Soars Straight Through the 900 Yuan Mark

Yarn; The market was initially peaceful in the morning, but the trend was weary. This was due to reports that the Guotai shipping vessel, carrying approximately 2,000 tons of cotton and cloth, had been detained. This caused renewed anxiety. At the same time, the exchange's yarn and cloth opened sharply lower, and the wind was especially fierce. As a result, the Double Horse market situation was also affected, showing signs of hesitation. When the exchange's cloth prices suddenly jumped sharply in the second and third sessions, the market conditions changed dramatically, the floor turned rapidly, and buying voices shook. Shorts, seeing the unfavorable trend, scrambled to cover. As for the general floor, they specialized in the move of throwing stones down a well, taking the opportunity to chase higher. Buyers came one after another, and there were not enough chips to distribute, so the market soared straight through the 900 yuan mark. However, Hong Kong bank transactions were still slow and inactive. This was because, after days of circling, there were too many shorts. Now, seeing the unfavorable environment, they all started to cover, so the market price rose directly. However, the gains in the past two days have also been sharp, and the future waves are becoming more and more vast. The high price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,907 yuan, and the low price was 1,862 yuan. The afternoon opening immediately rose to 1,914 yuan, eased to 1,909 yuan, and then rose again to 1,929 yuan at the close due to warehouse warrants. The off-exchange price was 1,931 yuan.

Double Horse opened in the morning, covered by rumors, opened small at 1,872 yuan, and immediately fell to 1,861 or 2 yuan. However, some buyers were quite active, and then rose again to 1,872 or 3 yuan. Upon hearing that the exchange had rebounded, people's hearts suddenly turned strong. Shorts on the floor were panicked and dragged in at market prices. As a result, buying voices were frantic, and the market rose steadily, from 80 yuan to 90 yuan, straight out to over 1,900 yuan, and the situation became even tighter at the close, at 1,907 yuan. It was found that 15,100 bales were traded in half a day. The amount purchased by each bank is listed as follows:

Nanyang 80 Hong Kong 110

Counterparts 15,000 Statistics 15,100

Gold; The Double Horse futures market continued its efforts, and the rising wind became more and more diffuse. The eagerness of all parties to absorb and cover reached unprecedented records. Although there was no special news, people's hearts were surprisingly active and high. Although US cotton was soft, the spot price, under the absorption of all parties, moved abnormally, and the intensity of its step-by-step rise was endless, causing the factory orders to become surprisingly tight, so there was talk of shorts posting. In addition, the exchange's drastic fall and rise, and the futures yarn followed suit, with buyers gathering like bees and the short position's front line shaking. Under the disorder, covering was even worse, so near and far terms have rushed out of the 1,800 yuan mark. At the beginning of the morning, the factory orders initially fell slightly due to the decline in foreign cotton, and the futures yarn opened and fell accordingly, with near and far terms falling by about 10 yuan. After entering, the trend reversed, and the factory orders first soared, and the futures yarn rose sharply by 8 yuan to more than 10 yuan to the noon closing. In the afternoon, it continued its efforts, still tired and recovering, and the rising wind became more and more widespread due to the intensity of pulling. The prosperity of the floor buyers, the shortage of chips, the October period once reached as high as 1,820 yuan, the November rise was as high as 1,822 yuan, and the December was also as good as 1,845 yuan. After a rush out, it slightly returned downwards. As a result, the near and far terms both rose sharply by 32 yuan to 38 yuan. The price table is listed below:

October November December

Opening 1755.0 1770.0 1795.0

Highest 1820.0 1822.0 1845.0

### Securities; Sichuan Gang Stops Selling; Public Debt Turns Higher

Public Debt Black Market; Yesterday, the market was quite strong due to the turn of the Hunan Provincial War to victory.

All kinds of goods, such as yarn and flowers, have soared to astronomical prices, rising sharply. Public debt is no exception. Therefore, although the spot market is crowded, it does not hinder the psychology of going long. Every time there is a spot market sale, it once turns down slightly, and then turns higher again. It is still difficult to see a small market for the time being. Yesterday morning, Yitai and Lianyi bought in, supplied by Hengkang and Renfeng. The rest were mostly retail investors going in and out. The market price of Category C opened at two yuan, first trending lower, and then turning higher, rushing out of two yuan.

Then, Runde, Dingkang, Shengda, and Hongda all had sales, and the market was slightly fatigued again. The key to the current rise and fall is whether the Sichuan Gang continues to sell as the standard. It did not fall because of the danger of Changsha, and it did not rise because of the victory in Changsha. It fell completely because of too much stock, and it rose because of too much money. Yesterday's market price ended up rising two and a half jiao to five jiao. The trading volume was about one million six hundred and seventy thousand yuan. The following is a brief table:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the Previous Day

Also, at the Zhongye Public Association stock market, the buying force was extremely strong, and most of the stocks rose to new highs. The opening market was firm, and it did not decline until the close. This is because the holidays are approaching, and the prospects are good. Industrial stocks and rubber stocks are on the same pace, but the gains are mostly in the well-known stocks.

### Food; Rice Market After All Timid

Yesterday, foreign rice initially flat and then rose, and the market price saw another plate pile-up. The reason was that when the market opened in the morning, the entrance and exit were balanced, and the market lacked the appearance of progress. It was then reported that Dafu Foreign Firm had a small amount of ready-to-load rice, a telegram contact of 1,300 tons, at a price of 141 yuan, and that the Public Sale small amount of rice also had a negotiation of 10,000 tons, at a price of about 133 yuan and 2 jiao. Therefore, people's hearts were timid, and the selling atmosphere turned strong. The spot price of the small amount of rice immediately dropped to 118 yuan. It was then heard that Dafu's telegram was not transferred, and the public sale of 10,000 tons was also afraid of being difficult to approach. Therefore, people's hearts turned, and the floating households in the customer gate took the opportunity to absorb the rice at a flat price. The market price gradually rebounded, and the price of the small amount of rice exceeded 9 yuan to 119 and a half yuan. The closing price saw a profit-taking exodus, still opening at 119 yuan. The other rice also turned from fatigued to firm, and the result was close to the previous evening. The Yingsi company small amount of rice was 140 yuan, the second was 135 yuan, only slightly piled up compared to the previous market. However, until the afternoon, the shape of the market turned flat and soft again due to the lack of continued actual sales and the letting of the node in the warehouse. The total trading volume of spot rice was 24,500 bags. The Yingsi company had 6700 tons, and the inventories of foreign rice at various warehouses were found to be 1,122,695 bags, 5,540 bags less than last week.

The thick and thin new and old glutinous national rice market, because the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, the porters are engaged in finishing, resulting in a sudden shortage of arrivals, and the local village stomach is turning to more earnest because of preparing for accumulation. In the situation of scarce arrivals and wide sales and unbalanced supply and demand, the prices of both japonica rice have increased by two or three yuan per ton. It is estimated that the southern early broken is 1556 yuan, the Kunshan new japonica rice is 153 yuan, the second is 150 yuan, and the new Dujian has lost its way since it was raised in the previous dynasty, but it is still open at 133 yuan to 131 yuan.

The glutinous rice because the selling price has already been loud enough, sales turned weak, but the cargo owner selling intent is still firm because the cargo is scarce, so the market is fixed, open Hong Kong high white yuan 143 yuan and a half, 142 yuan, ordinary 140 yuan, the second is 138 yuan, glutinous tea grass stock will be exhausted, strong and unusual, still open 134 yuan.

### Tapioca Flour Transshipment Active

Yesterday tapioca flour was active in transshipment and actual sales, and the prices of American and Camden flours rose in unison. Floating dealers and scattered hoarders took the opportunity to drag them in, and the market was quite tense. However, large hoarders stopped buying due to letting the node, and there were no consultants, and there were also scattered customers who took profits at high prices. Therefore, although the market was tight, the increase was not as expected by the general public, but no new orders have been made for a long time, and actual sales have always been strong, and the foot of the flour market is still solid. In the morning, the price of the fortress was 35 yuan and 4 and a half jiao, and in the afternoon it was from 5 jiao, 6 jiao to 35 yuan and 7 jiao. Bananas were 35 yuan, 1 and 2 jiao, Jinlong Xizhan was 33 yuan, 4 and 5 jiao in the early market, and in the afternoon it rose from 33 yuan, 5 jiao and a half to 33 yuan, 7 jiao and 5 points.

The price of wheat was still lacking in whole batch arrivals at 50 yuan, and the Japanese factory's purchase price also reached 478 yuan.

### Oil Market; Even Oil Already Being Sold; Speculation Still Not Letting Go

Dalian soybean oil was already being sold yesterday, and the price per company's code was 245 yuan, which is only 1823 yuan per city. However, the quantity to be distributed has not yet been determined, so the market opened flat in the morning, and people's hearts were greatly lowered. The futures price once fell by 34 yuan due to the oil merchants throwing out one after another, but the multi-party group still refused to give up and continued to pull up the price. Therefore, the price rose again after falling, and the result was higher than before, with more than 10,000 Dan of factory refined oil being traded.

### The Exchange Equalization Fund Will Reduce Foreign Exchange Supply: Shanghai Merchants Request a Relaxation of Quotas; The Use of Export Drafts Deserves Close Attention; Importers Pay High Prices to Compete for US Dollars

According to sources in the banking sector, the Exchange Equalization Fund's approved supply of foreign exchange to Shanghai merchants for this month will be reduced by US$1 million compared to September. September was US$7.5 million, and October will be reduced to US$6.5 million. Therefore, various industries have sent representatives to Hong Kong to request the Equalization Fund to supply more foreign exchange. Banking circles did not explain the reasons for the reduction in foreign exchange supply but expressed hope that the Fund's supply in the future could be increased.

### Connection Between Dutch East Indies and Shanghai is Possible

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury states that merchants are very active. Although there are reports that some representatives have left Shanghai for Hong Kong, it is more accurate to say that the majority of merchants are going to Hong Kong to resolve their own business matters. At the same time, there are signs of a resurgence of the black market in Shanghai. It is crucial that the Hong Kong authorities can truly ensure that the recent export drafts are fully used for legitimate purposes. There are widespread rumors of various illegal activities. At the same time, a system of connection between the Dutch East Indies and Shanghai is possible. The motive is said to come from importers, who are willing to pay high prices to buy US dollars.

### Various Organizations Jointly Send Congratulatory Telegrams: The Great Victory in Northern Hunan is Inspiring

All sectors of this city are heartened by the news of the unprecedented victory in the Second Battle of Changsha, which has garnered worldwide attention. Yesterday, various Shanghai industrial, commercial, and other organizations jointly sent congratulatory telegrams to the Central Government.

### Unimpeded Postal and Telegraphic Communications Between Shanghai and Changsha

The postal and telegraphic communications between Shanghai and Changsha in northern Hunan are becoming increasingly smooth. According to sources at local telegraphic agencies, telegraphic communications between Shanghai and Changsha have never been interrupted. However, currently, due to congestion from military telegrams, only telegrams from banks sent from Shanghai are being handled. In terms of postal delivery, there are frequent exchanges. The Shanghai Postal Administration receives and sends a particularly large amount of airmail, which is transferred via Hong Kong and then transported to Yunnan by air, making it extremely convenient.

### Profiteering Merchants Rampantly Raise Yarn Prices: Secret Order for Investigation

It Impacts People's Livelihoods Severely; Strict Sanctions Should Be Imposed

Recently, cotton yarn prices have been manipulated by profiteering merchants, with each piece soaring by more than 200 yuan. With the arrival of autumn, this has a particularly significant impact on people's livelihoods. Upon learning of this situation, the Central Government was extremely angered and has secretly ordered the authorities stationed in Shanghai to conduct a strict investigation and impose severe sanctions on hoarding profiteers. After this order arrived in Shanghai, the responsible authorities secretly dispatched officers to conduct investigations into the yarn, flower, and money industries.

### One-Shift Work System: Gradual Support from the Business Community

Various Industries with Interrelated Time Zones with Foreign Ports; Frequent Commercial Information Makes Adoption Difficult

The Shanghai Times reports that the Shanghai Power Company has begun to study a one-shift work system (from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM), which could greatly reduce fuel consumption. It is expected that the results of the study will have a significant impact on whether various parties support or oppose this measure.

### Power Company Begins Research

According to a senior official of the company, this can only be effective if all Chinese and foreign businesses implement a one-shift work system. However, among the stores in the International Settlement, Chinese stores consume the most electricity, and it is doubtful that they would be willing to close early and suffer business losses. Moreover, in office buildings, many will continue to consume coal and electricity in the afternoon and evening. Furthermore, after employees of commercial firms finish their work in the afternoon and return home, this will inevitably increase the electricity and fuel consumption in their residences. However, if water heaters are turned off early, it would be quite effective in saving fuel.

### Shipping Industry Finds it Difficult to Adopt

The Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury reports that the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce held a meeting on the 2nd to discuss adopting a one-shift work system in winter to conserve fuel. Some expressed disapproval, as ships from all over the world arrive in Shanghai at any time, so shipping companies cannot change their working hours. Based on the current situation, some British firms in this city may not support this measure. However, it is said that a few American firms have already changed their working hours. It is believed that after the correction of daylight saving time, many commercial firms will follow suit and implement a one-shift work system. Furthermore, an official of the Public Works Department stated this morning (the 3rd) that the Bureau has not yet decided on the date to end daylight saving time. It is expected that this matter will be discussed and decided within the next week, possibly implementing it from the 11th or the 18th.

### Passengers to Hong Kong Require a Deposit: Shipping Companies Telegraph for Clarification

Since the Hong Kong government announced the revocation of foreign agents for entry permits effective October 15, although local agents here can still apply for these permits on behalf of passengers, the privilege of issuing temporary entry permits in Shanghai will terminate on October 15. Passengers who have already obtained temporary entry permits issued by various agents must depart for Hong Kong before the 10th of this month and arrive before the 15th, otherwise, they may be denied entry. Furthermore, according to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, who inquired with authoritative sources in the transportation industry, passengers arriving in Hong Kong after the 15th of this month, regardless of their class of travel, must pay an additional deposit of HK$100 to be allowed to land. The reporter further inquired with various shipping companies, who stated that they do not intend to collect this deposit and will not sell tickets without a formal hard-copy entry permit issued by Hong Kong authorities. The companies have telegraphed Hong Kong for clarification.

### From the Beginning of Next Year: Six Types of Consumer Goods Under Monopoly: Salt, Sugar, Tobacco, Alcohol, Matches, and Tea

According to relevant sources, the design work for the monopoly of six important consumer goods—salt, sugar, tobacco, alcohol, matches, and tea—has been fully completed by the end of last month. Regulations and measures are also being drafted to begin the monopoly. In terms of operations, it is planned to establish six companies to manage these affairs, with branch offices in various locations. The Ministry of Finance has also decided to establish a National Monopoly Bureau to be responsible for all administrative management. Furthermore, the country will be divided into several monopoly zones based on production and sales distribution, with a monopoly sub-bureau established in each zone.

### Workers of the Meller Launch Struggle for Jobs: Turmoil on the Puxi Waterfront

The "Tenay" Launch Was Leased by the Kailan Mining Administration: Workers Were Expelled and Plan to Reclaim the Launch

The British Meller Shipping Company, in addition to its oceangoing ships, has eight local launches, which specialize in towing large import and export ships and carrying passengers, and also has eighteen cargo barges, with a total of 260 coxswains and sailors.

### The "Tenay" Launch

Recently, the launch "Diana Mollel" was leased by the Kailan Mining Administration for use between the New Customs Wharf and the Kailan Coal Yard Wharf, carrying employees of the company. Because the original "Yinping" launch was dispatched to Hong Kong, the "Tenay" was leased as a replacement. On Saturday morning (the 27th) of last week, the handover took place at the New Customs Wharf. Unexpectedly, the original coxswains and sailors of the "Tenay" launch were expelled and landed, and the Kailan Company dispatched the coxswains and sailors of the former "Yinping" launch to serve on board.

### Workers' Actions

The workers who left the "Tenay" launch negotiated with the Meller Company, which initially agreed to reassign them to other launches. However, after several days of negotiations, the matter was ignored. To show solidarity, the workers of the other launches and cargo barges jointly went on strike the day before yesterday (the 1st), and on the morning before yesterday (the 2nd), the workers hired a small motorboat to go to the Kailan Yard to detain the "Tenay" launch.

### Two Launches Chased Each Other

Unexpectedly, when they sailed to the Yangshupu waterfront, the two launches met. The workers ordered the "Tenay" launch to stop. The coxswain of the "Tenay" launch, in a panic, accelerated and sailed to the Lu Jiazui Customs Port Police Station (commonly known as the Water Patrol Station) pontoon and docked alongside. The coxswains and sailors all boarded the police pontoon. The Meller workers then returned to Puxi to await a resolution. It is heard that the striking workers, in addition to demanding that all personnel of the "Tenay" launch be reinstated, also plan to demand wage increases.

### New Films Sent to China: No Longer Certain

Regarding the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee’s suspension of providing exchange settlements for Western film rental fees, cinemas in Shanghai and Hong Kong that specialize in showing Western films have separately requested the Equalization Fund and American film companies to maintain the status quo. However, there is no certainty about this matter. Therefore, American film companies have suspended the shipment of new films to China. Whether the demands of cinemas in Shanghai and Hong Kong can become a reality is uncertain. Hollywood film companies have not yet responded, but judging from the general situation, there is little chance of success. According to a reporter from the Daguang News Agency, who inquired with relevant parties yesterday, there are currently still three months' worth of unaired American new films left in Shanghai for use. As for photographic films such as Kodak and DuPont, due to transportation difficulties and the lack of a continuous supply, there is a risk of interruption. What remains in the city is only enough to maintain for half a year. Therefore, not only are cinemas specializing in showing Western films panicking, but Chinese film companies are also feeling that the future is fraught with difficulties.

### The Mamantoff Murder Case: The Assailant Changes His Confession: States That the Person Who Instructed Him to Commit the Crime Was Named Pan Ying and Resided in Hongkou

The Shanghai Times reports that after the Russian businessman Mamantoff was stabbed to death on Route Lafayette on the 14th of last month, the assailant Liu Fanglin, the accomplice Zhang Xinwu, and the Russian actor Khovass, who is suspected of being the instigator, have been arrested by the French police. The assailant Liu initially confessed that Zhang instructed him to commit the crime, but later changed his confession, stating that the person who instructed him to commit the crime was a Chinese man named Pan Ying (transliteration) residing in Hongkou. This person promised to pay 2,700 yuan to kill Mamantoff and first had Liu recognize Mamantoff's appearance before waiting on Route Lafayette on the evening of the 14th. Upon seeing Mamantoff on the street, he fired a shot to assassinate him, then fled into a nearby street and hired a rickshaw to return. The French police have dispatched detectives in all directions to apprehend Pan Ying and continue to investigate the motives for the murder. It is heard that if Khovass is confirmed to be the instigator of the murder, Mamantoff's family will demand 30,000 yuan in compensation.

### French Power Company Announces Electricity Restrictions: 25 Times the Fee for Exceeding the Prescribed Amount

The Shanghai Times reports that the French Tramways and Electricity Company, in order to make citizens deeply aware of the need to save electricity, announced a new measure yesterday: Electricity consumption exceeding the prescribed allocation will be charged at 25 times the fee. According to the company, the prescribed allocation is based on the average amount of electricity consumed during the four months with the highest electricity consumption between July of last year and June of this year. The funds collected from exceeding the consumption amount will be allocated by the administrative authorities to a special fund for the benefit of all users.

### Hong Kong Restricts the Entry of Cash: Travelers Feel Deep Inconvenience; China Travel Service Can Provide Small Amounts of Travel Expenses

News from Hong Kong reports that the Hong Kong government has restricted the amount of cash that passengers can bring into the country, limiting each passenger to £5 in British gold or the equivalent in other currencies. Many passengers traveling to Hong Kong transfer to other ports, and £5 in British gold, equivalent to only HK$75 or CN$400, is not sufficient. Local banks in this city have also received freezing orders for payments in Hong Kong currency and Chinese currency, so they do not offer Hong Kong exchange services. It is learned that the China Travel Service can provide small amounts of necessary travel expenses through its Hong Kong branch. However, applicants for remittances must present ship tickets and other documents proving that they are indeed travelers to Hong Kong before the funds will be provided.

### Previous Detention of the Thai Ship: News of Release

The Thai ship "Suriyothaiwaha" loaded a large quantity of foreign rice in Bangkok on the 11th and 12th of last month and arrived in Shanghai, docking at the Longmao Pier in Pudong for unloading. After the rice was unloaded, the ship was fully loaded with export goods in Shanghai and was scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on the 28th. Unexpectedly, before setting sail, the ship was detained by the Jianghai Customs. It is reported that the ship was detained for violating customs regulations on export goods. The Taishengli Company, which previously acted as the ship's agent, stated that they have already cleared up the misunderstanding and the ship should be released for export yesterday. However, as of yesterday evening, the ship was still docked at the Longmao Pier, with no sign of setting sail. It is said that the ship may be released today, but it is difficult to predict.

### Japanese "Izumo" Ship Sails into the Yangtze River: "Luzon" Ship Returns to Shanghai

The U.S. Navy's Shanghai-based shallow-draft gunboat "Luzon" set sail on the morning of the 1st of this month and patrolled the Yangtze River. It is now learned that the ship returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM and is still docked at the Yangjingbang waterfront. The Japanese Navy's Third Fleet flagship "Izumo" suddenly left Shanghai yesterday morning. It is heard that it exited the Wusongkou and sailed upstream along the river, possibly heading to Nanjing or patrolling upstream. Details are unknown.

### Moral Society Appeals for Saving and Economizing to Help Those in Need

The Shanghai Three Teachings Moral Charity Association spares no effort in providing assistance to hidden poor and street refugees. Various organizations also deeply commend the Association's work. The American Red Cross has continued to donate 200 bags of oatmeal to the Association, and the International YMCA has donated 500 yuan to support the Association's relief efforts. As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, intellectuals, feeling that extravagance is meaningless, the Festival Economy Committee has advocated saving during the Autumn Festival to help those in need. The Association has also issued an appeal to all sectors of society to save on banquet expenses and transfer the funds to charitable causes, which has gained the sympathy of various sectors of society. Donations of funds and goods can be sent to the Association at No. 10 Hongyun Villa, Lane 70, Jing'an Temple Road.

### U.S. Military Club: New Location Secured

The Shanghai Times reports that the U.S. Marine Corps in Shanghai has reached an agreement with the British Church of Christ, 1623 Avenue Road, to lease the church for use as a club on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. The remaining three days will be reserved for the church members to hold meetings. The U.S. Military Club was originally located in a building adjacent to the Dahua Theater on Jing'an Temple Road, but recently, as the building has been sold to the Jewish General Association, it has moved out to find a new location.

### Mrs. Silas Hardoon, Lisa Calieri, Passes Away Yesterday

Suffered from a Prolonged Illness, Old Age, and Medical Treatment Was Ineffective; No Direct Heirs, Leaving Behind a Huge Fortune

Mrs. Lisa Calieri Hardoon, the widow of the late Silas Hardoon, suffered from dementia several years ago and had been recuperating in the Aili Garden, receiving medical treatment. Unexpectedly, in the past three weeks, her condition worsened, and she suddenly vomited blood. After the family took the blood to the hospital for examination by a doctor, it was said to be dementia combined with lung disease, already in the third stage. After medical treatment, she eventually succumbed to old age and ineffective medicine, passing away at 5:55 PM yesterday, at the age of 78. The funeral is scheduled for tomorrow.

### Real Estate: A Start from Scratch

Mrs. Hardoon was from Shanghai. She was poor and lost her parents at a young age. In September 1886, she married Silas Hardoon, a Jewish expatriate in Shanghai. At that time, Hardoon was serving at the E.D. Sassoon & Co., and had already shown promise and was valued by the authorities. In 1900, Hardoon & Co. was established, specializing in real estate business. Almost half of the real estate on Nanjing Road was owned by Hardoon. Hardoon had become a British citizen, and served as a director of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, and later as a director of the Public Works Bureau of the International Settlement for a total of 14 years. The value of his real estate increased sharply with the increasing prosperity of the Shanghai market, and his assets accumulated more and more, becoming a leader among foreign merchants. Mrs. Hardoon contributed a lot to Hardoon's success behind the scenes, so the couple remained deeply in love even in their old age.

### Conversion to Buddhism

After middle age, Mrs. Hardoon converted to Buddhism and built a hermitage in the Aili Garden. She persuaded Hardoon to spend more than 200,000 yuan to print 8,000 kinds of Buddhist scriptures for circulation. She also founded Huayan University to promote Buddhism, and devoted herself to charity and education. She urged her husband to do his best for it. She generously donated huge sums of money for both north and south water disasters and large and small disaster relief efforts. She also established free primary schools in and outside the city, published a series of classic elementary school books, added to the Kangxi Dictionary, and opened the Aili Garden from time to time to use the admission fees as charitable funds.

### Huge Fortune Left Behind

Hardoon died in 1931. According to his will, all his property was managed by Mrs. Lisa Calieri Hardoon. At that time, there was a lawsuit between Hardoon's relatives over the distribution of the property, and Mrs. Hardoon won the case. Later, there was the incident of adoptive son George Hardoon being expelled for licentious behavior. Recently, several Jewish people claiming to be Hardoon's relatives have hired a Japanese lawyer to request inheriting 62.5% of the late Hardoon's estate, but there has been no progress. It is estimated that the current total value of Hardoon's estate is as much as 80 million yuan in national currency.

### No Direct Descendants

Mrs. Lisa Calieri Hardoon's name was inscribed by Lian Nanhu, a licentiate, and she has no direct descendants, but has many adoptive children, both Chinese and foreign. George Hardoon is one of them. Mrs. Hardoon originally intended to make him her heir, but a rift developed due to George's misconduct. One of her adoptive daughters, Luo Shunhua, is said to have married the movie star Bai Yun not long ago.

### Japanese Man Carrying a Large Sum of Cash: Robbed on the Way: Police Arrest One Thief

At 10:25 AM yesterday, three Japanese employees of the Daifeng Yarn Factory were carrying 22,000 yuan in cash to the factory to pay wages. Unexpectedly, they were stopped by a thief near Yichang Road on West Suzhou Road. The thief pulled out a gun to threaten them, first seizing a package of banknotes (2,200 yuan) from one of the Japanese employees, and then attempted to continue the robbery. One of the three Japanese employees shouted for help. At that time, Chinese police officer No. 2489 nearby heard the alarm and went to arrest them. However, the thieves preemptively opened fire on the police to resist arrest and fled on foot. The police officer drew his gun and fired back, firing two shots, and also blew the police whistle. Nearby police officers were informed and encircled them, resulting in the arrest of one thief, who was immediately taken back to the police station for questioning.

### Prisoner Commits Assault: Sentenced to Additional Imprisonment

Gui Genxiang (formerly a carpenter), a Ningbo prisoner serving a five-year sentence at the Ward Road Prison, has been in prison for three years. On August 27th of this year, at around 7:00 AM, he had a dispute with fellow prisoner Tao Jingen over a trivial matter, resulting in a quarrel and fight. As a result, Tao's scrotum was torn and his testicles were injured. He collapsed in extreme pain and was sent to the police hospital for treatment, and only recovered after a month. Gui Genxiang was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the hearing. Based on Tao Jingen's testimony of the incident, police lawyer Jiang Baolian requested additional punishment. As a result, Gui Genxiang was sentenced to an additional two and a half years of imprisonment as a warning.

### Soochow University and Zhejiang University's Sacred Music Groups Jointly Participate in Worship: Led by Professor Zhao Meibo

### Three-Painter Oil Painting Exhibition Closes Tomorrow

The three-painter oil painting exhibition held in the painting hall of the Daxi Company has been very popular with visitors in recent days.

Zhu Qizhan's "Cold Forest Evening Glow" and "Magnolia," Qian Dingzhi's "Double Vase of Flowers" and "Zhao Feng Garden View" and "Pujiang Jia Bo," are both insightful and exquisite, and also have a creative spirit. Zhou Bichu's "A Corner of the Studio," "Temple," and "Dahlia" also show a new path, with bright colors.

### Letters to the Editor

Rectification Statement from the Chinese Christian Charitable Relief Association

In your esteemed newspaper on the 1st of this month, a section mentioned the statement of the United Christian Association. Now, our association will provide the details of the situation. Our association was established in the spring of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940], initiated by Mr. Dong Shaoru, uniting over a dozen Christians and pastors. We rented four rooms at No. 2, Lingji Street, Yuhang Bridge, South City, as a dormitory for homeless refugees, providing accommodation and meals to the elderly, young, disabled, and infirm as much as possible. However, the number of people in need of rescue increased daily, and the resources were insufficient. Therefore, we expanded to No. 45, Dongjia Alley, Lingji Street. Currently, there are over a hundred elderly and young people who do not work and forty others who come and go daily. Daily expenses are not raised through external donations but are maintained by Mr. Dong's efforts. However, recently, prices have risen sharply, and the association's funds are strained. One person's efforts are limited. Therefore, the current chairman, Mr. Tan Qiuyin, invited famous opera singers to perform at the Lyceum Theatre. Our members donated funds. However, due to religious issues and heavy rain, the results were not ideal. If anyone has any inquiries, please come to our office at No. 103, Renji Hospital, Shandong Road. We would be happy to welcome you.

### Brilliant Autumn Light

Autumn is the best season of the year. When we recite the verse "The weather is cool but not cold," we feel comfortable. The beauty of autumn, apart from the cool climate, is the clear sky, free from dust and sand, as blue as the sea. Looking into the distance from a high place, the mind feels particularly broad and pure. Try walking slowly through the long woods in the morning or at dusk, and you will surely appreciate the brilliant autumn light. (Photo by Kang Zuyi)

### A Slave to One's Child?

— Feifei

It's not even six o'clock yet, and Xiao Xuan is already calling "Mom!"

He is my "automatic alarm clock," accurate in time and powerful in ringing, far above the average "Swiss-made" one. While others are still dreaming sweet dreams, I have to accompany this "alarm clock" to stroll in the garden.

— How bitter, Feifei!

Many classmates frown for me, as if they pity me very much.

Pei said to me like this:

"You can't see a spoiled wild child, but you're acting like a typical mother."

"Perhaps you're enjoying yourself, but our impression of you is that it's such a waste. You're limiting everything in your life for your child! Please remember that you are not only a 'mother' but also a 'person'! You still have your universe, your future!"

"Why do you like being a slave to your child? That's what Hitler's followers do."

"?" — Pei's words also startled me for a while.

So I asked myself: "Are you a follower of Hitler?"

Even though I was "calmly reflecting" like a third party, my brain immediately popped out to admit:

"When you saw Hitler 'go back to the kitchen,' you were already the mother of two children!"

My reason returned to its original state. It told me that what I was doing for my child was more natural than anything else, even more natural than when I embarked on the path of love.

So, I once told a few classmates, especially Pei:

"If you don't misunderstand, the first chapter of the life textbook should be 'Slave Studies.'"

"People who achieve success in a certain career must have something concrete or abstract that has become their slave:"

"Medical scientists become slaves to bacteria and pathology."

"Musicians become slaves to pianos, guitars, violins—'rhythm.'"

"Electricians are slaves to 'induction' and 'electrons'!"

"Writers are slaves to 'rhetoric.'"

"At the same time, it's very clear: 'Lovers become slaves to each other.'"

"To be more serious, officials are slaves of the people!"

"Conversely, people can also fall into a bizarre 'slave desire.' Today, the people who are thinking about coal and rice are slaves to rice and coal."

"So, I don't feel ashamed of being a slave to my child. At least (pardon the expression), it's more honorable than you lazying in bed and being slaves to enjoyment!"

It's not that my thinking is one-sided. I express great excitement about maintaining my current "slave" status. I think that if I abandon my current position as a slave and, as Pei said, look for another "universe," that would be the same as banishing my master—my child—from the universe.

"A slave to one's child," if it can lead to something bright and beautiful, why not do it?

Today, the sun has just come out, and I'm already pushing Xuan's stroller around in the small garden. I can't help but feel my joy:

"Child! Mom is a slave of love, and there is nothing else in my heart—except you! I wish Xiao Xuan happiness, I wish Xuan a budding flower! Like the morning light bringing vitality, like the daytime bringing light, filling the blue sky, the bright red earth!"

The morning glow reflects our faces: beautiful Xiao Xuan; proud mother—"a slave to her child!"

### The Origin of Names

— Su Wu

In the world, every human being "except all things" has a name, and other various animals and plants also have a name to mark their identity. Although, the origin of some names may be laughable or strangely unexpected; however, a name is still a name, and after using it for a long time, it is no longer considered strange.

For example, let's talk about the kangaroo among animals. Its English name is "Kangaroo." The origin of this word is also very special:

When Captain Cook discovered Australia, his sailors brought a strangely shaped animal back to the ship, but no one knew what it was called. So, they brought the animal back to shore to ask the local aborigines. As a result, the sailors returned to report that:

"This is a Kangaroo."

Years later, people realized that when the aborigines were asked the name of the thing, they replied "Kangaroo," which actually meant:

"What are you saying?"

From then on, what the aborigines of Australia said, "What are you saying?", became the English name of the kangaroo and has been used ever since.

### Transparent Baby Bed

— Ke Zhong

Recently, the Mercy Hospital in Chicago, USA, in order to ensure the safety of newborns and to enable nurses to take care of babies more closely, specially built a transparent baby bed, which is made of a newly invented plastic, shaped like a glass cover. The actions of the baby in the bed can be seen at a glance. This kind of transparent baby bed can also be converted into an oxygen mask or greenhouse, which is a major advancement in saving the lives of babies and benefits mankind infinitely.

Thirteen Years of Wandering in Shanghai

"Old Third, in the beginning in the Three Kingdoms, General Zhao Si saved Ah Dou three times at Changban Slope, in the Yangtze River. Everyone respects and admires him. For your daughter's sake, I have also made two meritorious contributions. Look, this Zhao surname of mine won't disgrace my ancestors again, will it?" Yu Kun sat smiling on the corner of the table, looking at the Autumn Begonia father and daughter.

Mei Bao came home with Manager Meng again today, even Xiao Gouzi came along.

"Big Brother, hold on with the boasting!" Autumn Begonia, holding a cup of tea, stood by the doorway and said, "Last night I thought carefully, although Mei Bao was rescued by you, I have now added an opponent. I'm afraid I can't stay here any longer."

Autumn Begonia's illness has been cured for more than twenty days, but his body has not fully recovered. In the sixth lunar month, he still has to put on two large cloth jackets before he dares to go to a windy place.

"Why?" Yu Kun scratched his bald head as if he really didn't understand.

"It's because the method you used was clever, but you did it too fiercely. Not to mention Shang Lao Er hating me to the bone, even the Meng's family may come looking for trouble after you leave!" Autumn Begonia said with a worried look.

"But, Dad..." Mei Bao wanted to interject, but Yu Kun immediately waved his hand to stop her.

"What are you afraid of them! Do you think they will commit murder and arson?" He simply wanted to make Autumn Begonia anxious for a while. "Even if you can't live here, can't you move somewhere else?" (228)

### Radio Listening

— Zhi Yu

Most radio stations, except for a few, have a major flaw, which is that the speed of the records is inaccurate. Some are too fast, some are too slow. When it's fast, it's like a "horse race." A perfectly good original tune will become an "allegro." And the sound that comes out is sharp and harsh, making people get goosebumps. As for when it's slow, "sick man moaning" is the most appropriate description, and that kind of energy will really make people doze off. On this point, I hope that the authorities of all radio stations with faulty records will pay attention to it.

I know that there are many drama lovers among the readers, but what we can usually hear on the radio is mostly the so-called "civilized drama" of "Blue-Green Mandarin" mixed with "Wu dialect," while the pure and noble drama of the northern country is "as rare as the morning star." Here, I want to introduce Democratic Radio to all drama-loving listeners: They have special drama programs every Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday from 6:30 PM to 7:00 PM, inviting major famous drama groups and movie stars in Shanghai to broadcast dramas. In the past, the professional drama troupes that participated included the Tianfeng Drama Society, the Shanghai Drama Art Society, and the Zhonglu Drama Society. Famous stage stars include Tang Huaiqiu, Tang Ruoqing, Lan Lan, Xia Xia, and Han Fei. Famous dramas broadcast include "Grievances in the Qing Palace," "Border Town Story," "Under the Pomegranate Skirt," and "National Hero." Although "one can only hear the voice, but not see the person," the melodious and crisp sound is enough to make you feel relaxed and fascinated and satisfy your drama addiction!

Finally, I want to mention the "common disease" of general radio stations, which is that the "accounting" reports are too lengthy, especially the comedic broadcasters. The advertising reports are always a long string of chatter, and they are all the same. The result must be that listeners turn off the radio or listen to other stations. At five or six jiao per word for electricity, who would want to listen to your lengthy and annoying report? I hope that all broadcasters will improve this shortcoming and know that reporting advertisements is not about being lengthy and verbose, but about being concise and attracting attention!

The above is only a brief expression of my humble opinions based on what I have heard.

### Little Chronicles of Pear Garden Figures

— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Illustration by Zhang Yizhang

(3) Zhang Eyun

Among the southern Kun characters [female performers] who have achieved success in the old capital in recent decades, Zhang Eyun can be considered the most successful. And among these so-called four major Kun Dan [female roles], she is also the most versatile. In addition to Qingyi [serious female role], she is also good at the Happy Marriage and Red Luan type of plays. Although Xue Yanqin and Xin Yanqiu also have their own accomplishments, neither of them plays Hua Dan [vivacious young female role]. She should lose to her in this regard. Her Qingyi and Hua Dan are both good at and proficient, and her style is similar to that of Xun Huisheng. Her demeanor is casual, with an air of aloofness, which is also somewhat similar to Xun Huisheng. To position her in the position of Xun Huisheng among male roles, everything is naturally suitable without any borrowing. She was once married to a nephew of the Anhui Governor, Mr. Ni, and to the husband of Jin Youqin, the differences in time being far apart, but she soon divorced and returned to the stage, but her reputation did not decline as a result. Over the years, she has been on the rise. Now, she and Xin Yanqiu are like the states of Jin and Chu, confronting each other and unwilling to concede. At this time, among the Kun actors, they have the same "demeanor of a predecessor."

### Lang Yuxiu Vocal Concert

— Prepared

Miss Lang Yuxiu is the daughter of the famous photographer Mr. Lang Jingshan. She has a natural talent for singing. In the 26th year of the Republic [1937], she went to Europe to study and was admitted to the Royal Conservatory of Music in Belgium. The following year, she scored first in the entire school in the subjects of theory and aural training. In the public examination in 1939, she won the highest award. Last year, the European war spread to Brussels, and the school was closed. Miss Lang returned to China. At that time, traffic was blocked, so she was stranded in various parts of South Africa, and it took seven months to reach Shanghai. Now, Mr. Lang Jingshan's old friends Mr. Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guanqun, Yuan Hesong, and Hu Guigeng, in order to make Miss Lang's hard work for several years available to the public, initiated the Lang Yuxiu Vocal Concert, scheduled to be held at the Lyceum Theatre at 9:15 PM on the 17th of this month. There will also be a piano solo by Miss Li Huifang, and a violin and piano duet by Mr. Xu Weilin and Mr. Singer. It is said that Miss Lang is learning high-pitched coloratura, which is the most difficult to learn in singing. There are very few who can do this, not only in China, but also among singers in Europe and America. Apart from the special seats that have been reserved by friends, there are very few 20 yuan tickets and tickets below 15 yuan left. Music lovers should not miss this opportunity.

Chapter 17: Rushing to Anger for a Beauty

Zhang Cangqiu said: "Very good, let us not forget today's words and swear to fulfill this wish." So the four talked about the situation of their troops and left the forest, returning to their own camps to wait for Wu Sangui to show what he would do. Wu Sangui was originally ordered to advance into the customs, but the army had already set out, so why did it stop halfway? Of course, this matter could not but be doubted. Originally, Sangui's natural intention was to rush to the capital to defend the imperial capital, fight bravely against the bandits, establish immortal achievements, be famous in history, and have power in the court. He himself could be like Guo Fenyang in the Tang Dynasty, with wealth and fame gathered in one person. But when he arrived in Luanzhou, he suddenly heard that the bandits had broken the capital and Emperor Chongzhen had died. He was greatly shocked, feeling that the bandits' military power was indeed very powerful, like a broken bamboo, with no resistance. Then, even if his army rushed to the capital, it would be like being a guest in someone else's home, losing the advantage of the situation. And the momentum of the bandits was even stronger, waiting at leisure, with the advantage of numbers, the outcome could not be predicted, he had no certainty, and could not help but hesitate, so the army stopped there. Since he was worried about the safety of Yuanyuan, he had repeatedly sent messengers to Beijing to inquire about news. Suddenly, he received a letter and 40,000 taels of gold from his father, Wu Xiang, sent by a trusted person. Wu Xiang's letter said that when Li Zicheng attacked Chengtianmen, the capital's garrison was empty, and they did not dare to fight. The three camps outside the city surrendered, and Heaven had abandoned the Ming Dynasty, so he had also surrendered to the King Chuang. And King Chuang kept him and taught him to write to persuade Sangui to return, so as not to lose the etiquette of a prince. He first rewarded the followers with 40,000 gold. He must understand the times, act according to the situation, and surrender to the new master as soon as possible, so as not to lose wealth and status. Otherwise, the lives of the family would not be guaranteed, and the father and son would never see each other again. (185)
