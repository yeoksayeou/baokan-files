### Bai Chongxi Urges Guangxi Army and People to Defend the Border with the Yunnan Army; 70,000 Japanese Troops Deployed Along the Transportation Lines of Vietnam, Guangxi, and Yunnan; Large Quantities of Military Supplies Have Continuously Arrived at Haiphong

When General Bai Chongxi of Guilin inspected the southern Guangxi region and reviewed the troops defending the Guangxi border, he addressed the troops, stating that when the Japanese army attacks Kunming, it may re-enter Guangxi Province through Vietnam. He urged the army and people of Guangxi Province to cooperate with the army and people of Yunnan Province to defend the border. Upon receiving this information, the Southwest Command learned that approximately 20,000 Japanese troops landed in Haiphong between October 17th and 24th. They are currently deployed along the highways and railways connecting Yunnan and Guangxi provinces. The Japanese army has also transferred 50,000 reinforcements to the Tokyo area, half of which have been deployed along the Vietnamese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. On October 28th and 29th, Japanese transport ships arrived in Haiphong again, carrying troops, 20 tanks, and 4,000 barrels of oil. It is also reported that the Japanese army in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province...

The public statement issued to various newspapers by the Director of the Information Office of the Burmese Government in Rangoon stated that the latest reliable information indicates the possibility of the Japanese army attacking Yunnan Province. Chinese telegrams create the impression that the Japanese side must be making greater preparations and mobilizing more troops than currently apparent to launch this attack. The statement further stated that if the Japanese launch an attack, the Burmese people should not consider this merely an extension of the entire Chinese incident to another front, as the Japanese claim. The statement reiterated Berlin's pressure on Japan to pay attention to the Soviet Union, saying, "Regardless of where the cat will jump, we in Burma cannot ignore the potential possibilities contained in the current situation."

Mr. Hu declined to comment on the words and actions of some people in the area and Hong Kong. Mr. Hu brought four proposals, which are the opinions of various overseas Chinese groups in Singapore: 1. Request the government to strictly implement the program for resisting Japan and building the nation, and eliminate all speech and actions that violate the Three Principles of the People. 2.

### Hu Shi Meets with Roosevelt; Personally Delivers Document from Chairman Chiang; Suggests More Aircraft Aid to China; Large Numbers of American Air Force Personnel to Arrive in China Next Spring

Washington: Chinese Ambassador to Washington, Dr. Hu Shi, presented a document to President Roosevelt yesterday, stating that the document contained "[information that the President should obtain]". Later, Dr. Hu Shi said that China hoped to obtain a large amount of lend-lease materials, especially aircraft and bombers. He also stated that he believed the Chinese people had no reason to worry about the US-Japan negotiations. He stated that Churchill's warning that if the US and Japan were to go to war, Britain would declare war on Japan within an hour, was extremely "important". According to reliable sources, the document presented by Dr. Hu Shi to President Roosevelt was issued by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and mentioned the situation in the Far East. It suggested allocating more aircraft, especially bombers, to China. Observers here speculate that the document also included recent statements from other prominent Chinese figures emphasizing the importance of immediately dealing with Japan, an ally of the Axis powers. Some Chinese believe that Japan is currently the weakest of the Axis powers. Some even stated that if Japan were to be subjected to Allied bombing and counterattacks by the Chinese army, it would be forced to abandon its aggression and ties to the Axis.

Hong Kong: Hundreds of American aviation pilots, technicians, and mechanics will join the Chinese Air Force in the second quarter of 1942, preparing to launch a general counteroffensive in the autumn. The above news has been confirmed by the president of Southwest Associated University in Kunming. Following the suggestion of General Magruder, head of the US military mission to China, Flying Fortresses under the lend-lease act will also arrive in China with American pilots. Ten air force bases will be opened in South China, scattered across Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces. It is estimated that 50 Flying Fortresses will be enough to help the Chinese army counterattack, and the airfields can also be used by various democratic countries if necessary. It is rumored that there are nine Flying Fortresses in Changsha, flown by American pilots, which repelled a group of Japanese aircraft. This is because the speed of these aircraft is unmatched by Japanese aircraft. Chinese front-line officers believe that American-made fighter planes and bombers are absolutely necessary tools for a successful counteroffensive by the Chinese army. Japan has approximately 800 aircraft in China, and China needs at least 1,000 aircraft and 70 Flying Fortresses to gain air supremacy and destroy Japan's military-industrial bases.

### Minister of Education Chen Lifu Eloquently Discusses Social Education

Chongqing: On the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, Minister of Education Chen Lifu published an article titled "Developing Social Education to Promote a Cultural Construction Movement" to inform social education workers across the country. He first stated that the realization of the Three Principles of the People and the purpose of education lies in striving to fulfill Sun Yat-sen's great aspirations. The Founding Father's strategies for national construction, which emphasize psychological construction to rectify people's hearts, social construction to strengthen organization, and material construction to enhance material strength, are indeed the foundation of great cultural construction. Social educators should be responsible for training every citizen, making them members of the movement. Therefore, the Ministry of Education coordinates social education activities with the cultural construction movement. Secondly, he informed social education comrades of two important ideas. First, social education workers should have a sense of responsibility that if even one person is not reached, it is their fault. Since social education is not limited by time and space, and there are always objects to be taught and opportunities to teach, there is a responsibility to teach everyone. Tools and methods, such as movies, broadcasting, drama, songs, paintings, and reading materials, are very convenient and abundant, making teaching easier. Social educators, like Yi Yin to the people, should make it their mission to educate the entire population. Secondly, social education workers should understand the relationship between their own mission and the war of resistance and national construction. They should participate in promoting public training work that benefits the cause of the war of resistance and national construction, such as the New Life Movement and the National Spiritual Mobilization. Moreover, since the target of social education is adults, its work is, in effect, a more direct contribution to intensifying the training of cadres for the war of resistance and national construction, and its achievements can be readily seen. In conclusion, he encouraged social education comrades to emulate the Founding Father's spirit of being tireless in learning and teaching, to educate the people, and to renew the culture and construction, thereby laying a solid foundation for social education's active development. The Three Principles of the People will thus be popularized throughout the country, and social education will be promoted to the world. (Dispatch, 11th). Military news from Chongqing: 1. The Japanese army on Tianzipo, across the river from Yichang, harassed the Chinese forces but were repelled.

The Chinese forces returned fire, suppressing the attack and preventing the Japanese infantry from moving rashly. 2. The Japanese army in Zhongxiang County and near the old Yellow River railway bridge launched a reinforced counterattack, but was dealt a heavy blow and stopped. Chinese and Japanese forces are currently in a stalemate. (Dispatch, 11th)

### Salt Monopoly to Be Implemented on New Year's Day Next Year

Chongqing: Director of the Salt Affairs Administration, Miao Yunqiu, said that the salt monopoly has been set for implementation on New Year's Day next year. However, the salt administration structure will not be changed, and the official collection and transportation system will continue. The division and shore system will be abolished. Therefore, salt merchants will be free to transport and sell salt, but the selling price will be controlled by the government. The government hopes that the price of salt can be unified, at least within each province. Regarding the official collection and transportation funds, the Four Banks Joint Treasury has loaned 80 million yuan, and the national treasury has allocated 11 million yuan to increase equipment and transportation tools. Miao recently visited six provinces—Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Hunan—to inspect salt administration. He said that everything was satisfactory. (Havas Agency dispatch, 11th)

### Fierce Fighting in Crimea; German Offensive Checked; Soviet Counteroffensive Successful on Moscow Front

Berlin (United Press dispatch, 11th): The official German news agency acknowledged yesterday that German forces advancing on Sevastopol in the Crimean Peninsula have been halted by a fierce Soviet counteroffensive and are making no progress. The news agency claimed that the German forces had broken through the Soviet counteroffensive after fierce fighting. London (Reuters dispatch, 11th): A Soviet midnight communiqué stated that fighting was particularly intense in the Crimea and Tula regions of the Eastern Front. It was also reported that Soviet forces on the Moscow Front in the Volokolamsk and Mozhaisk regions had switched to the offensive, and Soviet forces in the Soppchov region were also counterattacking. With the German forces on the Northern Front hampered by blizzards, heavy snow, and severe cold, they have shifted their main offensive to the Crimea. Regarding the northern route, the Germans claimed to have occupied the important transportation hub of Tikhvin (approximately 100 miles southeast-east of Leningrad) while fighting between Lake Ladoga and Lake Ilmen. Only a narrow strip of wasteland remains between the German positions and the Svir River bridgehead held by the Finns, allowing the Soviet forces to advance and retreat, but there are no roads through this wasteland.

London (Reuters dispatch, 11th): A Reuters military correspondent stated that the German claim that they were massing troops for a new offensive against Moscow should not be taken lightly. The Germans may be mobilizing reserves and ammunition in preparation for a major offensive in the spring, hence the current halt in their offensive. Furthermore, the German command may feel that with the approach of winter, large-scale military operations cannot be resumed, but rather that the main forces must be withdrawn to areas where it is easier to maintain warmth and supplies. If so, the Germans will use minimal firepower and hold onto their already occupied positions for as long as possible, while the Soviet forces seize the initiative. The German high command seems to have adopted this strategy on the Leningrad front. Hitler's statement that he does not want to achieve victory for the sake of prestige suggests that his offensive will likely be suspended during the winter.

### Philippine Presidential Election

Manila (United Press, 10th): Nearly 3,199,000 Philippine voters, two-fifths of whom are women, went to the polls today to elect a president and vice president, 24 senators, and 96 congressmen. The senators and representatives will form the Philippine's first Congress to replace the unicameral National Assembly currently established under constitutional amendments. Prior to the establishment of the Republic in 1935, the Philippines had a bicameral system, but senators were elected by districts rather than by a national electorate. It is expected that the election will be dominated by Quezon's Nationalist Party, and that Quezon and his friend Armanuela will once again be elected president and vice president, respectively, is a foregone conclusion.

### The Crisis in the Far East is Imminent; Joint Anglo-American Action to Restrain Japan; A Powerful British Fleet to be Deployed to the Pacific if Necessary; Doubts about Appeasement Towards Japan Now Dispelled

Reuters, London, 11th - The "News Chronicle's" Singapore correspondent cabled today, stating that according to a responsible non-British source, Anglo-American joint action to deal with the Far East, especially any new aggression plans in the Pacific islands, has already reached the stage of detailed discussion of practical problems. As for the broad cooperative action policy or the basis of this plan, the two sides reached agreement some time ago. The correspondent also said that, to his personal knowledge, in addition to supplying the British forces in Malaya and Australia with aircraft and materials, the United States has taken more concrete steps to ensure British cooperation in overcoming any new illegal territorial ambitions of a certain third country. The main purpose of this joint plan is to prevent any Axis-incited blitzkrieg.

Reuters, Singapore, 11th - There is widespread satisfaction here with Prime Minister Churchill's clear warning to Japan, which is seen as preemptively eliminating any hopes Japan might have of forcing a diplomatic wedge into the democratic front on the eve of Kurusu's arrival in the United States. It is understood that a military blitzkrieg is not possible, and Japan's greatest hope is to exploit any opportunity to sow doubt and suspicion between the two major democracies. The news that Britain will send a powerful naval force to the Far East if necessary is not surprising here. What is truly gratifying is Churchill's statement that the British Air Force now surpasses the German, and that the British Navy can make its power felt in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Therefore, people here believe that air power is extremely important to the military strategy of the democratic front in the Far East, whether in the hinterland of the Burma Road or on the sea lanes of the Pacific. In fact, General Pownall, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Far East, stated that if the Malay Archipelago is blockaded, the British forces alone can break through it within six months, and it now seems possible to accomplish this in an even shorter period. Furthermore, the official statement from Chongqing, which came at the same time as Churchill's warning, that the ABCD countries have fully agreed on measures to protect the rear of Chongqing, can also be seen as a clear indication that if Japan wages war against the United States, all British forces mentioned by Churchill will be deployed against Japan within an hour from their alert positions. Although it is not known what joint measures the democratic countries have agreed upon to defend the Burma Road, there is ample evidence among the Chinese here that the Western democratic countries will provide all assistance short of war.

Washington, 10th - Most diplomatic and press circles believe that the Pacific crisis is imminent and virtually unavoidable. Judging from the developments in Washington over the past two days, the US government is intensifying various preparations in both diplomatic and military terms to cope with this unprecedented crisis. There is widespread satisfaction here with Prime Minister Churchill's speech yesterday, in which he issued a warning to Japan, declaring that Britain would join the United States in fighting Japan if the United States goes to war with Japan. The Prime Minister's high praise for Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, calling him a great hero and commander in Asia, has also made a deep impression here. The Prime Minister's warning to Japan is likely due to Japan's imminent threat of invasion of Thailand. The Prime Minister also confirmed that the United States and Britain are implementing a joint defense plan in the Pacific. Observers believe that the situation will undergo significant developments after the House of Representatives passes the amendment to the Neutrality Act this Wednesday (the 12th). The US Navy Department's order for the Marine Corps in China to prepare for immediate withdrawal is clearly a preparation for war, without any doubt. Therefore, observers believe that the visit of Japanese envoy Saburo Kurusu will inevitably fail. On the day Kurusu arrives in the United States, American public opinion will take a hostile attitude, more than double that of when Nomura arrived in the United States this February. Currently, various arrangements are being made overseas. In Washington, the atmosphere on the surface is very tense, but in reality, it is very calm. It is generally believed that the US government and people are determined to cope with the crisis, whether in the Pacific or the Atlantic.

Prime Minister's Solemn Declaration Inspires China

Reuters, Chongqing, 11th - Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi made the following comments on Prime Minister Churchill's speech: Prime Minister's stern warning to Japan, just as the Tojo Cabinet is busy conducting war preparations in Vietnam, is wholeheartedly welcomed. This timely public declaration, clearly indicating that Britain will assist the United States if it goes to war with Japan, is beneficial because it not only demonstrates the unity of the United States and Britain but also strengthens the ABCD front. The Prime Minister's statement that powerful British naval forces can be deployed to serve in the Far East further enhances the power of his warning, as this is the first time such a warning has been made in this tone. Japan seems able to understand it. The Prime Minister's praise for China is greatly appreciated, especially his affirmation that China is a pillar of civilization and part of the world fighting for democracy and freedom against tyranny and barbaric force, which is even more deeply appreciated.

Reuters, London, 11th - Some quarters believe that Prime Minister Churchill's speech in the Guildhall in London, in addition to preemptively responding to Hitler's future peace moves, was aimed specifically at Japan. The Prime Minister's solemn declaration, made at a time when Japanese envoy Kurusu is about to arrive in Washington and the Japanese Parliament is about to open, that Britain would declare war on Japan within an hour of the outbreak of war between the United States and Japan, and that the British fleet would sail to the Pacific if necessary, is a sincere piece of advice to Japan not to take steps that would worsen the situation in the Pacific. Churchill did not mention the US-Japan talks, but only said in general terms that Britain is doing its best to preserve peace in the Pacific. It is not known what the British government considers to be a fair and reasonable solution to the Pacific problem. However, it can be seen from the Prime Minister's praise for the Chinese people's resistance under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his belief that China's resistance must result in the liberation of the country that British policy is based on the Nine-Power Treaty. The activities of British and Dominion politicians, such as Duff Cooper and Wavell, in inspecting the Far East can also be seen as a preparation for future contingencies. According to a political reporter, the Japanese government's attitude has not put the British government in a state of reassurance, and British cabinet members have various intentions to prevent Japan from further aggression and to provide all possible assistance to China. If Japan sends troops to Yunnan, it could have serious consequences, as Japan could easily inflict a major blow by cutting off the Burma Road. The Prime Minister's speech was one of the most important he has ever given, and was enthusiastically praised by the 200 people in attendance, including 20 government officials, representatives from various Allied nations and Dominions, and important figures in the Church of England.

Reuters, Chongqing, 11th - Chinese people here were greatly encouraged today when they received Prime Minister's speech, declaring that if a crisis occurs in the Pacific, Britain is ready to go to war with Japan. As far as the Chinese reaction to this speech is concerned, it can be said that it is universally welcomed, as the Prime Minister's speech may be the most straightforward statement on the Far Eastern situation made by Britain to date. It shows that Britain's attention to Far Eastern affairs has not been neglected due to European affairs, that Britain is prepared to cope with any Far Eastern incidents, and that the United States and Britain will take joint action in the Far East. This speech naturally gives rise to various interpretations. The points currently raised by people here are as follows: The Prime Minister did not mention the possibility of a Japanese offensive against the Burma Road, and what the Chinese are most concerned about is what the United States and Britain will do if Japan attacks the road. Can the meaning of this speech be seen as the United States and Britain will fight Japan if it attacks the road? The Prime Minister's speech only announced that if Japan goes to war with the United States, Britain and India will declare war on Japan, but did not mention that Britain will also declare war if Japan attacks the Soviet Union. Up to now, there have been various indications that Japan is trying to avoid conflict with the United States. Now that the Prime Minister is still talking about the United States and Japan going to war, can this speech be seen as indicating that the United States and Britain have decided to fight Japan, or is it merely an attempt to force Japan to submit? The above three points are merely conjectures. Chinese people here generally believe that the Prime Minister's speech must be a clear indication that the United States and Britain will help China and defend their interests in the Far East against Japan.

Anglo-American Control of Sea Power Will Impose a Blockade on Japan

Reuters, London, 11th - The "Times" correspondent in Washington cabled that there was no surprise among the British people regarding the many references to the Far East in Prime Minister Churchill's speech at the Guildhall. According to reliable sources, East Asian affairs occupied the entirety of the British-American cabinet meeting held last Friday, which was called a historic secret. It was only after the fact that the newspapers learned that arrangements for increasing the power of the Pacific by the United States and England were proceeding. Regarding Churchill's claim that England would declare war following the United States entering war with Japan, it has already revealed the possible power that Japan would encounter. The entire contents however, can only be revealed by the United States. There are no signs of easing pressure on Japan here, as there will be a continued increase in aid to China, and Anglo-Dutch-Soviet mutual coordination, with steps taken that may have the result of a full economic blockade on Japan, and there are no reasons for doubt regarding the existence of a free and independent China, which has been proposed as one of the necessary conditions for future reconciliation between the United States and Japan. However, it remains unclear how Japan, in its current situation, can transition from a policy of conquest to cooperation with countries in the East and West. Reuters, Sydney, 11th - All Australian newspapers published Prime Minister Churchill's warning to Japan and unanimously expressed satisfaction. The "Sydney Sun" editorial stated that this speech implies a complete Anglo-American alliance. Now that Britain is able to send a powerful fleet to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, the land transportation in the Middle East and Malaya can be secured by sea. Singapore will cooperate with Manila and Hawaii as the key to Anglo-American maritime strategy, and this force will be able to completely blockade Japan and control sea power.

Thailand Will Become a Battlefield; Calls on People to Rise Up

Reuters, Bangkok, 11th - While broadcasting on the official Bangkok Radio Station, an announcer issued a very serious warning to the nation, repeatedly urging the Thai people to prepare for war. It is said that Thailand will be dragged into war this year or next year. We can only escape war by strictly adhering to neutrality, but we must be prepared to defend our neutrality. The announcer also made the audience aware of the formidable force of potential aggressors, saying that the military equipment of the aggressors who may attack Thailand is perhaps a hundred times more powerful than Thailand's equipment, but the Thai people must not abandon their traditional heroic resistance because of this. The people of the country should be awake at all times, and not wait until the sound of cannons roars and bombs fall in front of their doors before preparing, and especially when the weather is becoming drier now, they must not be unprepared. The announcer's speech exceeded the allotted time, and as it ended, he repeatedly asked the people of the country to be awake, listen quietly, think about it, believe in this statement, and take action. This speech has made a deep impression on the audience. Some audience members believe that this speech was unexpected and quite alarming. Reuters, Bangkok, 11th - According to Sri Krung Daily, war in the Far East seems difficult to avoid. In the event of a conflict between the United States and Britain and Japan, Thailand may soon become a battlefield. Thailand's strategically important and abundant natural resources may easily make it a stage for war. The local newspapers also carried news of Japanese fishing boats illegally fishing in Thai territorial waters, saying that last week, a motorboat took advantage of the wind and rain to open to an island near the Kra Isthmus to engage in unauthorized fishing. A notice was posted outside the Japanese Consulate today, urging Japanese residents to behave properly and stating that those who ignore this warning will be deported or have certain rights revoked as punishment.

### US-Japan Negotiations; Slim Hope for Compromise; US Guarantees It Will Never Sacrifice China; Japanese Envoy Kurusu Arrives in Honolulu

Reuters, New York, 11th - According to a Washington dispatch, isolationist Senator Taft told reporters today that President Roosevelt has rejected a substantive proposal for reconciliation offered by Japan because Japan refuses to promise not to attack Vladivostok. This proposal was made in recent talks between US and Japanese officials. According to the report, Japan offered to withdraw from China, but would maintain troops in five major cities. The Japanese side hesitated to guarantee not to attack Vladivostok, fearing that Japanese cities or ports would be bombed by the Soviet Union. It is very doubtful whether the special envoy Kurusu can obtain a compromise at present. According to Taft, son of the former President of the United States, the above information belongs to Crichton and is allowed to be published, but he said that he believes the news is reliable. International News Service, Washington, 11th - Japanese envoy Kurusu, who is attempting to avert war in the Pacific at the last minute, is currently en route to the United States. Authoritative sources here told International News Service reporters today that President Roosevelt is prepared to present the following six points to Kurusu: The US is unwilling to sacrifice China for US-Japan peace; The US government is not prepared to reduce military assistance to China; If Japan guarantees to end all military aggression in the Pacific, the US is willing to make economic concessions to Tokyo; Japan must abandon its demand for freedom of military action in the Far East; If it attacks the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, or Singapore, the US fleet will be prepared to take action; The US insists that the above areas should remain the property of their original owners, because the US obtains its rubber, tin, and other important raw materials from there. At the same time, President Roosevelt met with Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shi. It is reported that the President has assured Ambassador Hu that China will never be abandoned to Japan.

Reuters, San Francisco, 11th - Japanese envoy Kurusu, who flew to the United States on an emergency mission, is currently stranded on Midway Island due to aircraft trouble.

United Press, Honolulu, 11th - Kurusu arrived here from Midway Island this afternoon and saw the powerful US fleet gathered here. Kurusu notified the Japanese Consul General Kita here by radio that he was quite tired and did not want a formal welcome or special gathering or program.

### Japanese Perceptions of Prime Minister's Speech

Reuters, Tokyo, 11th - When asked by foreign reporters this morning to comment on Churchill's speech regarding Britain's position on the US-Japan situation, Information Bureau spokesman Ishii replied that Churchill must be singing his own praises and that there was nothing strange about his words. If he had said anything else, it would have been strange. Churchill apparently made this statement based on the ideals expressed by US Secretary of the Navy Knox. According to Domei News Agency, well-informed sources believe that the speech indicates Britain's desire to maintain peace in the Far East and that Britain is constantly trying to prevent a conflict between Japan and the United States, because once it breaks out, US aid to Britain will be greatly reduced and the supply line to the Far East will be jeopardized.

Reuters, Tokyo, 11th - Today's newspapers and public opinion are apparently inconsistent in their interpretation of Prime Minister Churchill's speech. It is difficult to determine whether Churchill intended to incite war or to prevent the possibility of war. For example, Domei News Agency, a semi-official Japanese news agency, broadcast to Europe, saying that according to well-informed sources, the Prime Minister's speech is quite in line with Britain's attempt to prevent a conflict between the US and Japan, fearing that the US will reduce aid to Britain. On the other hand, newspapers such as the Nichi Nichi Shimbun said that the purpose of the Prime Minister's speech was to make the United States fight Japan in order to protect British interests in Asia, and that Britain's naval power in the Far East is one-tenth of Japan's.

### Soviet Ambassador to the US; Litvinov; Appointed Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs

Soviet Ambassador to the US; Returns Home for Consultation

Reuters, Moscow, 11th - According to official announcement, the People's Committee has appointed the Ambassador to the US, Litvinov, as Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs.

Havas, Washington, 10th - Secretary of State Hull told news reporters today that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, has already departed to return home for consultation, and will return to his post as soon as his official duties are completed.

### US and Japan Ease Freeze; Establish Reciprocal Agreement

United Press, Tokyo, 11th - "Asahi Shimbun" reported today that the US and Japan have established a reciprocal agreement to ease the ban on the freezing of assets. Under this new regulation, US government agencies in Japan, including the embassy and consulates, are exempt from requiring permits for bank deposits and withdrawals, and can obtain Japanese currency from remittances from their home government.

### Japan Only Respects Force; US-Japan War Inevitable; General Yarnell Loudly Calls Out; Appeasement Towards Japan Will Be Too Late

United Press, New York, 11th - Former Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, warned yesterday against appeasing Japan, saying that US-Japan war is inevitable. Admiral Yarnell, in cooperation with the Institute of Pacific Relations, delivered a series of speeches on Columbia Broadcasting System, entitled "Asian Events." The Admiral said, "Appeasing Japan is fated the same as Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler in the past. If we withdraw from the East, it is tantamount to withdrawing from half of the world. If Hitler does what he wants in Europe, then we will be forced to withdraw from the other half of the world and become an isolated and helpless country. If this fate befalls us, the world will become a very small world, and if the views of the isolationists prevail, the world will return to the chaos of the Middle Ages." The Admiral also said that even if the US recognizes Japan's new order and withdraws from the Far East, including the Philippines, the avoidance of war will only be a matter of a few years. Yarnell also said, "If Japan overthrows its tyrannical rule and abandons its dreams of the Far East, war can be avoided. However, there is no hope of this happening, and Japan is an ally of Germany. If we go to war with Germany, we will, and Japan will be involuntarily drawn into the war. Based on the above reasons, it seems that war between our country and Japan is inevitable. It would be advantageous in every way if the US and Britain could force Japan into war now. This is how Britain and France pressured Italy at the beginning of the European War." The Admiral also warned that Japan's control of Singapore would force the US and British navies to withdraw from the Far East, and said, "The minds of the Japanese military only respect one thing, and that is force."

### Editorial: [China's Freedom and Equality]

This is a well-known and widely recited. great rallying cry. For eighteen years, it has been tied to the hearts of 450 million people, forming a motto for joint effort. And in the last four years, it has especially embarked on a process of practice, approaching final realization day by day. Going back forty years from eighteen years ago, the launch of the movement to pursue China's freedom and equality has lasted a full sixty years! Today, when the whole country commemorates the founding of the Republic of China, and the birthday of the great revolutionary leader who created this movement and left behind this phrase, the current situation in China approaching the light is truly the most timely and precious gift.

The attainment of China's freedom, the major prerequisite, must be to break the shackles imposed on China by the imperialist powers. The achievement of China's equality, internationally, must gradually enhance its position in order to be commensurate with its inherent historical and geographical conditions. Although China embarked on the road towards this great goal more than sixty years ago, only by glancing at China's current international environment can we fully believe that it has approached the stage of realization.

First, is the growth of China's fighting force. Four years ago, China had no active role in deciding the fate of the Far East or even itself. The Far East has always been a state of equilibrium among European and American powers and Japan. Under this situation, China was subject to all its developments and changes. However, as a result of four years of arduous struggle, all of China's latent forces have been brought into play, and all the corrupt elements that hindered progress have been swept away. The millions of troops and even larger reserves organized, equipped, and tempered in the arduous struggle, plus the elite air force, are a major new factor that has joined the international situation in the Far East and even the world over the past four years. What is especially important is that the high morale and fighting ability of 450 million people have caused the world's perception and evaluation of China to undergo an epoch-making change. In this way, a solid foundation for China's freedom and equality has been laid in both strength and psychology.

Second, is the rapid advance of construction endeavors. Four years ago, the goals of the various efforts we could see were mainly biased towards the stage of psychological construction. A major test came four years ago on the banks of the Marco Polo Bridge and the Huangpu River. The Chinese nation was ultimately able to live up to its divinely bestowed mission and resolutely raised the beacon of resistance. There is no doubt that this is the result of decades of efforts in psychological construction. On this solid foundation, China has been able to resist foreign insults on the one hand and implement its vast nation-building program on the other hand for the past four years, and has embarked on the stage of material construction in the nation-building strategy. At this time, on the one hand, because the progress of the war destroyed some of China's budding industrial base, this undoubtedly increased the difficulty of China's rear construction; but on the other hand, because the coastal blockade and the disruption of traffic between the treaty ports and the interior, the tentacles of imperialist economic aggression were mostly cut off, which formed a favorable condition for China's construction endeavors, sufficient to offset the former's unfavorable effects and more. China's top authorities have said that a country without a solid economic and material foundation will always stagnate as a vassal of the powers. All the achievements made by China in its efforts towards self-sufficiency over the past four years have begun to play a role today, providing the most reliable guarantee for China's freedom and equality.

Third, is the improvement of legal status. The constraints of the various unequal treaties suffered by China were, of course, only an inevitable product of its military defeats, its economic fragility, and especially its complete loss of self-confidence. Therefore, after fighting hard to this day, all unequal treaties have long lost their basis for existence. Any far-sighted European and American politicians have long recognized this point. Therefore, the British and American authorities have repeatedly issued declarations over the past four years, preparing to abandon all unequal agreements and treaties between them and China, and to treat China with a completely equal spirit. The agreement reached between Foreign Minister Guo and the British and American authorities before returning home to take office is only the beginning of a broader agreement. Of course, we cannot ignore that all of China's interactions with friendly countries over the past three or four years have also been conducted entirely under this new spirit. The improvement of China's international legal status has shown signs over the past four years and has unfolded a guarantee of complete freedom and equality in the future.

Fourth, is the increase in China's role in the evolution of the international situation. In the previous League of Nations, China's position was not as good as that of second-rate countries such as Romania and Turkey. This, in any case, was a state of complete incompatibility with its various conditions and the most unfair. However, after four years of arduous and heroic fighting, it has fought to a stalemate with first-class military powers; and in Europe, even powerful countries like France have declared collapse in the face of aggressive forces. In this way, China's international status today is naturally on par with powers such as Britain and the Soviet Union. The formation of the ABCDR front is a concrete expression of the improvement of China's international status. The greatest mission of China in the future is to further expand its role and fully achieve complete freedom and equality.

### Armistice Day Commemoration in Europe: Roosevelt's Speech Urges National Sacrifice for Freedom; French People Hold Pain in Their Hearts

A Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 11th:

President Roosevelt, yesterday, commemorated Armistice Day by leading senior civil and military officials to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington Cemetery. After two minutes of silence, he delivered a speech, the main point of which was to urge the American people to have a greater understanding of the sacrifices needed to maintain freedom and liberation in a world subjected to cruelty, tyranny, and enslavement. He stated that the sacrifices made by Americans in 1917 and 1918 were not in vain, that Americans believe it is worth fighting for freedom and liberation, and that they are prepared to do so.

An Agence France-Presse dispatch from Vichy on the 11th: France today commemorated the 22nd anniversary of the signing of the Armistice of World War I with a calm, depressed, and silent attitude. At 11:00 AM, one minute of silence was observed in memory of the 1.5 million French war dead. The Armistice Day commemoration in Paris was particularly somber and quiet, as the public was prevented by the authorities from even paying respects at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

### Full Text of British Prime Minister's Speech

A Reuters dispatch from London on the 11th:

Yesterday, at the inauguration luncheon held by the City Hall for the new Lord Mayor of London, Sir Laurie, Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech. His key points were:

*   To warn Japan that if the U.S. and Japan go to war, Britain will support the U.S. within one hour and declare war on Japan.
*   To praise China's heroic resistance.
*   To reveal that if the U.S. fleet were to operate in the Atlantic and require the British fleet to move to the Pacific, the British fleet in the Mediterranean could be redeployed to the Pacific.
*   To declare Britain's determination not to negotiate with the Nazis. Churchill's original speech is as follows:

Nazis' Heinous Crimes Spread War Globally

"According to long-standing custom, whether in times of peace or war, the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary deliver speeches at the City Hall annually, as we do today. This year, our ancient City Hall is in ruins, our diplomatic affairs have withered, and all of Europe is groaning under Nazi tyranny. The war, which began with Hitler's invasion of the Low Countries, has now devastated Europe and spread to Northeast Africa. It is now about to extend to most of Asia, and the remaining quarter of the earth will soon suffer the same catastrophe." After describing the German massacre of hostages in occupied territories, the Prime Minister stated, "The Vichy government's praise of German magnanimity is unbearable to the French people, and Darlan's proposed plan for loyal cooperation with those who conquer and kill French people is also a major problem. Even the arch-criminal Hitler himself is alarmed by the public outrage caused by his heinous crimes and atrocities. Therefore, it is Hitler who is threatened, not the French people. Hitler dares not proceed with his hostage-killing program, not out of mercy, but because of the fear for his personal safety that arises in his evil heart. You all agree with this. In general, I can say that the people who are killed in many places by Nazi executioners, whom they call communists and Jews, must be regarded as heroes who died for their country on the battlefield (applause). In some ways, the sacrifices of these people are even more meaningful than those of soldiers who die in battle. Their red blood, the innocent blood spilled on the execution grounds and killing platforms, will forever leave stains that will never fade for centuries. Let this be the foundation on which their so-called 'New European Order' will be built, and the terrifying system by which Nazi criminals and their quisling partners seek to rule many famous ancient cities of Europe, even to control all of Europe and dominate the world. The Nazis believe that the best way to achieve their ambition is through this."

British Navy and Air Force Are Stronger Than a Year Ago

The Prime Minister then compared Britain's position today with that of a year ago, stating, "In those days, our military equipment was incomplete. Now, a large part of the American navy, as Knox said, is taking action to deal with the common enemy. The Soviet Union's resistance has inflicted a terrible blow on German military power, and we also have an air force that is at least equal in quantity to the enemy and superior in quality. A year ago, I announced to Parliament that we had dispatched a fleet of battleships to re-enter the Mediterranean. Since then, German and Italian convoys have been repeatedly destroyed. Today, the Admiralty has reported the destruction of an Italian destroyer. The Italian navy is in decline, and our supplies can pass unhindered in all parts of the Mediterranean. From all of this, it can be seen that we are still the masters of the Mediterranean. (Applause) Today, I can say more, because of the impact of American aid, because of our sinking of the 'Bismarck,' because of our creation of excellent battleships and large aircraft carriers, and because of the decline in the morale of the Italian navy, I can tell you again at the Mayor's annual meeting that we now feel fully capable of serving in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean with a powerful naval force, accompanied by necessary auxiliary warships, when needed. We extend our long arms of kinship, like brothers and mother and child, to reach the people of Australia, New Zealand, and India. And the armies of these places have already fought with outstanding achievements in the Mediterranean theater. The actions of our navy towards Australia, New Zealand, and India, in conjunction with the American main fleet, will provide practical evidence and allow all who have eyes to see the power of freedom and democracy has not reached its limits."

If the U.S. and Japan Go to War, Britain Will Declare War on Japan Immediately

The Prime Minister then spoke about Japan, saying, "I must speak frankly and without evasion here. About forty years ago, we fought for the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1902, always strived to promote good relations between Britain and Japan, and also had good intentions towards Japan and admired many of its talents and qualities. However, I am horrified by the prospect of conflict between Japan and the English-speaking world. The respected interests of the United States in the Far East are well known. The United States is now making every effort to maintain peace in the Pacific. We do not know whether this effort will succeed, but if it does not, I feel it is my duty to announce now that if the United States does come into conflict with Japan, Britain will declare war in succession within one hour. Calmly and objectively observing the overall situation, I feel that it seems to be a very risky action for the Japanese people to throw themselves into a world game of opposing the three-quarters of the world's people in the Pacific in an entirely unnecessary situation. If a country's modern warfare depends solely on steel production, isn't it too dangerous for a country like Japan, which produces only about seven million tons of steel annually, to challenge the enormous United States, which produces about ninety million tons of steel annually? The assistance that the British Empire can give to the United States in various ways has not yet been calculated. I very much hope that peace in the Pacific will be preserved, as is the well-known aspiration of Japan's most enlightened politicians. Various preparations for common interests now threatened are now being implemented and continue to be implemented."

Churchill Praises China's Heroic Resistance

The Prime Minister then spoke about China, saying, "How can we not be moved by the Chinese people, under the leadership of the great Asian hero Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, fighting with their bare hands for five long years without the slightest slackening in their amazing defense of their national territory, freedom, and independence? If the noble resistance of the entire Chinese nation to aggression and expansion does not result in the ultimate liberation of their country, wouldn't this be a great tragedy for world civilization? I feel that this is an emotion that penetrates our hearts deeply."

Gratitude for American Aid; Unremitting Efforts in War

The Prime Minister then spoke again about Britain's current position compared to a year ago, saying, "On this day last year, we did not know where we could get a dollar of American currency. This is well known to you in London and need not be said by me. We were able to collect and send about 500 million pounds to the United States through a very strict plan, but our financial resources had reached their limit. A year ago, all we could do was order goods from the United States, and we did not know how to manage them afterwards, only with hope and encouragement. Soon after, the President's great policy and the passage of the Lend-Lease Act followed. According to this Act, about 30 billion pounds are dedicated to the cause of world freedom without keeping accounts of currency. From then on, we no longer heard the ridicule that American democracy only cared about money in its heart and mind. Undoubtedly, this Lend-Lease Act must be regarded as the purest act in history, and as far as we are concerned, we are not ashamed to receive this assistance. We ourselves have made unprecedented sacrifices in finance and economics. Now, the American government and people have announced that what they have given us will be sent to the front lines, so that we can devote ourselves to the determination to attack with all our strength. We are neither complacent nor slacken our efforts. However, in this short period, we have encountered many wonderful things. How can we not thank God? From the various developments that have already occurred, we can gain new beliefs and devote all the power in our souls and spill all the blood in our veins to our work. We have heard from many sources that Berlin will soon launch a peace offensive. The signs of the neutral countries are now quite obvious, and these signs all point in one direction, that is, indicating that the sinner who released the demons to harm the world now hopes to escape from the net of heaven with his unsustainable victories and unjust loot. We must absolutely declare our responsibility to ourselves, to our Soviet allies, and to the American government and people: whether we have assistance or not, and no matter how difficult or long the time, Britain and its government, in close cooperation with its autonomous territory governments, will never conduct any negotiations with Hitler or German representatives of the Nazi regime. We are determined in this, and we deeply believe that the ancient city of London will be with us to the end." (Applause)

### Import Association Cracks Down on Profiteering: Actual Actions Imminent, to be Realized by Next Week at the Latest; Price-Gouging Merchants in the French Concession Have Been Severely Punished; Those with Rice Stored in Warehouses Must Report Within Three Days

The Import Association established by the Municipal Council has finalized its plan of action and is expected to take practical steps within a few days to crack down on profiteering and hoarding of imported goods. It is reported that the Association held a special meeting today and then submitted a detailed report to the Municipal Council. An official of the Association said this morning that the action to suppress profiteering will likely be taken within this week or, at the latest, in the first half of next week. However, the details of the possible steps to be taken by the Association have not been disclosed. At the same time, it is reported that the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Liddell, and the American director, Mr. Myers, who are currently in Hong Kong, are in smooth progress in discussing with the Stabilization Fund the acquisition of more foreign exchange for the import of legitimate goods into Shanghai. The Municipal Council has received several telegrams from the two, the contents of which are unknown, but only that they mention various matters related to the price situation here.

Price-Gouging Stores Have Licenses Revoked

Shops in the French Concession that were found to be selling condensed milk above the price limit had 360 cans of 16-ounce weight and 255 cans of 8-ounce weight confiscated. The milk was confiscated from the following stores:

*   Yang Xiaosheng Store at 225 Rue de Sainte Marie
*   Wu Caitang Store at 1548 Route des Soeurs
*   Tang Bofu Store at 204 Avenue Albert
*   Shi Baiwen Store at 1008 Avenue Joffre

One of the above-mentioned stores was demanding 5.20 yuan for milk with a price limit of 2.70 yuan. Yesterday, 30 cans of KBm Japanese-brand milk powder, weighing a total of 75 pounds, were confiscated for the same reason. In addition, 23 stores at the following addresses were closed for the same reason, including 65 and 49 Rue du Pere Froc and 601 Avenue Joffre. This afternoon, the French police seized 34 cans of 5-gallon gasoline, priced above the limit, at 222 and 252A Route Cardinal Mercier. All of the above-mentioned stores have had their business licenses revoked.

A Special Department Established to Manage Prices

According to reliable foreign sources close to the Concession authorities, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement has greatly adjusted and expanded the organization among the Municipal Council general offices this week in order to manage prices within the Settlement. By yesterday, all adjustment and expansion measures had been completed. The Municipal Council has also established a Price Management Department, which will be jointly managed by the Municipal Council General Office and the Police Department. Mr. Peesley, the head of the Intelligence Office of the Bureau, has been appointed as the head of the department by the General Manager, Mr. Felippe. The department has been officially announced and is dedicated to managing prices within the Settlement. The Price Management Department will be responsible for implementing the management of various price management tasks resolved by the Municipal Council.

Deadline for Reporting Rice Stored in Warehouses

The Municipal Council has recently issued a notice ordering all wharves and public warehouses in the International Settlement to report the quantity of rice stored in each warehouse, as well as the name of the owner or person in charge. A detailed list must be submitted to Office No. 167 of the Municipal Council General Office by the 14th of this month for investigation. It is reported that the sale of rice will be ordered across the board. The notice also states that any individual, bank, business, or organization that has an economic or management relationship with the rice stored in this port (this type of rice exceeds the amount needed for private use for one month) should register the above-mentioned rice with Office No. 167 of the Bureau's General Office by the 14th of this month for verification. In addition, the time for retail rice stores to sell rice will be changed from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM starting today.

Surveillance of Warehouses Becomes Stricter

The Municipal Council specially mobilized the Shanghai Volunteer Corps from the previous day to guard the rice warehouses and godowns along the Suzhou Creek. Starting at 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps changed its guarding method, and the Volunteer Corps Headquarters sent two armored vehicles and four trucks equipped with machine guns to patrol the warehouse and godown areas in shifts to prevent rice smugglers from moving the hoarded rice. The mobilized Shanghai Volunteer Corps was stationed at the Special No. 1 Court on North Zhejiang Road and the barracks on North Henan Road, ready to respond to the Shanghai Volunteer Corps monitoring the hoarded rice in the warehouses and godowns at any time.

Private Smuggling Subsides, But Hiding Still Occurs

After the authorities of the two concessions forcibly implemented the new price limit of 130 yuan per picul for rice, the cunning rice shops and rice smugglers were greatly alarmed. As a result, some shop owners and rice merchants have been trying to secretly transport the stored rice to other places for hiding in order to profit. The authorities have been secretly investigating. Aware of the conspiracy of these gangsters, the authorities have been sending undercover agents to secretly investigate on important roads for days. Once rice trucks pass, regardless of whether there are several bags or dozens of bags, they are intercepted, sent to the police station, confiscated and confiscated, and then distributed to reputable and reliable rice shops for resale to citizens. According to statistics, the amount of rice confiscated in the International Settlement has reached more than 5,000 bags in recent days, and the amount of rice confiscated in the French Concession has reached more than 300 bags. At the same time, dozens of rice shop owners or employees who were detained for smuggling rice have also been punished separately. Therefore, since yesterday afternoon, the private smugglers have stopped their activities. Yesterday, the French police confiscated 9,000 bags of rice that had been hoarded within the concession. The rice was immediately issued to resale rice merchants to sell to consumers at a price of 130 yuan.

Regular Holidays as Usual

Hongkou is cracking down on speculation in rice. According to a report from the Da Zhong News Agency, negotiations have been made with the Japanese Consulate, and it has been agreed that the Japanese police will assist. Therefore, the Japanese side has also expressed its approval. Residents, in addition to being able to purchase Municipal Council foreign rice and other types of rice, will be strictly prohibited from transporting rice south of the Suzhou Creek. Retail rice stores can be allowed to transport rice if they purchase the rice at the regulated price and follow the regulated procedures. When retail rice stores in Yangshupu, Hongkou, are out of stock, they are allowed to apply to the Municipal Council for purchase. Those who violate the regulations of the Municipal Council, such as Japanese people or Japanese merchants, may be reported to the Japanese Consulate. Although today is a holiday for the birthday of the Prime Minister, the General Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the rice warehouses are still open as usual. Therefore, rice shops can still apply to the General Office for a transport permit to go to the warehouses to deliver rice. Yesterday morning, more than 15,000 people went to register to buy rice. The day before yesterday, more than 7,500 people registered with the Gordon Road Police Station. It is alleged that the Municipal Council is now handling the business of 1,200 rice shops, so the work is quite difficult.

Prices of Chemical Raw Materials Expected to Fall

Mr. Halley, a director of the Municipal Council and Deputy Chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries (China) Limited, left Shanghai for Hong Kong this afternoon (the 11th) to meet with the Stabilization Board authorities. This is one of the purposes of his business trip. However, according to Mr. Halley, he is not going to Hong Kong as a representative of the Municipal Council. Although Imperial Chemical Industries (China) Limited has obtained foreign exchange for some of its imports at the statutory exchange rate, it is reported that the company's representative in Hong Kong also intends to obtain more foreign exchange, which will lower the prices of chemical raw materials in this city. Mr. Halley is a former director of the Municipal Council. Since the election of the Ad Hoc Meeting at the last Taxpayers' Meeting, the vacant position left by the departure of Director Mitchell has been filled by the election of Mr. Halley.

### Denied Yesterday

Mr. Carlile, General Manager of the Dutch Java-China-Japan Lijn (JCJL) Shipping Company in this city and Dutch Director of the Municipal Council, denied yesterday morning that the company was currently closing down. Mr. Carlile said that he will go to the United States for vacation next month and will return to Shanghai around July next year. It is reported that during Mr. Carlile's absence, the position of General Manager of the Shanghai JCJL Company will be temporarily taken over by Mr. Spijkman, the former manager of the Kobe JCJL Company, who will arrive in Shanghai from Java next week.

### Wife of a Certain Prominent Figure Promotes New Life

It is reported that the wife of a certain prominent figure, considering that in this great era, although the women in Shanghai cannot participate in various practical anti-Japanese reconstruction work, many waste valuable time on meaningless socializing and mahjong and dancing, which leads to a loss of will and is not a good phenomenon. She has now decided to unite with many women to organize a group to promote thrift and a new life movement, and to strive to engage in various works beneficial to the country and society, as a model for women.

### First World War Remembrance Day Commemorated Solemnly Yesterday; Foreigners Gathered in Front of the Bund Monument; Flowers Were Laid in Silent Remembrance of Deceased Relatives and Friends

The U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, the American War Veterans Association, and the British Victory Association held a ceremony yesterday morning in front of the Bund Memorial to commemorate Armistice Day in memory of the compatriots who died for their country in the Great War. Many expatriates in Shanghai participated in the last Great War, and now their sons are also fighting on the old battlefields. Therefore, today's ceremony is even more solemn. At 8:30 a.m., members of the British Victory Association (all war veterans) and members of various British expatriate associations gathered in front of the Memorial and respectfully laid wreaths.

At 1:30 p.m., members of the British General Association held a memorial service and laid wreaths in front of the war memorial of the Association to commemorate the members and friends who died for their country in the war. Tonight at 8:00 p.m., members of the British Victory Association will hold their annual banquet and dance party at the Race Club. Although the British expatriates did not openly sell flowers for fundraising, individuals donated money to buy flowers. Half of the proceeds went to the British Victory Association's Charity Fund, and half went to the British Expatriate Central

War Fund, to be forwarded to the British Veterans Relief Association. Mr. Marjolin, the French Consul General in Shanghai, also went to the Bund Memorial this morning to lay a wreath to express his condolences. Those who accompanied him included Colonel Essowa, commander of the French army stationed in China, Mr. Poulisis, chairman of the Shanghai branch of the French War Veterans Association, and Mr. Tang Guti, director of the French Municipal Council. At 9:30 a.m., French expatriates gathered at the Yangjingbang Catholic Church to hold a mass to commemorate the French people who sacrificed themselves on the battlefield.

### Geng Jian

Since my brother left, the whole family and relatives and friends are very anxious, especially the parents. According to the current situation, my brother believes that if my brother can come forward as soon as possible, all problems will be solved smoothly. If my brother is now in the place and sees the newspaper, he will return to Tianjin in a few days to meet with his brother first. My brother will absolutely keep secrets on his behalf. If you can write a letter, please be sure to indicate the return address of the letter. If you can reply a few lines in the Tianjin Daily newspaper so that my brother can forward it to Zunfu to avoid accidents, it is especially hoped that all things will be handled responsibly by my brother. Otherwise, if you still cling to the delusion and delay, and if Zunfu uses desperate means, I am afraid it will be too late. I think my brother is intelligent and has always been concerned about the two elders, but I hope you will think twice. Brother Yu Bai

### Penalties for Hoarding Flammable Goods Will Be Increased; The Municipal Council Has Consulted with the Special No. 1 Court; The French Concession Can Confiscate Immediately

The Municipal Council, due to the recent fires in the Settlement, has launched a broad campaign to eliminate fire hazards and plans to introduce measures to impose strict penalties. This move by the Municipal Council is proceeding in parallel with the campaign to crack down on profiteering.

Maximum Fine is Only 300 Yuan

Article 35 of the Land Regulations by-laws is currently under consideration for amendment. According to the laws of China, the maximum penalty for storing flammable goods without a dangerous goods license is a fine of 300 yuan or imprisonment for one or two months. The Municipal Council believes that this penalty is too lenient and fails to eliminate the hoarding of flammable goods. Therefore, the Municipal Council has consulted with the Special No. 1 Court, explaining that the Police Department and the Public Works Department have discovered that the small fines set by the Special No. 1 Court are not enough to prevent hoarders from continuing to hoard flammable goods. The Municipal Council has received many reports since last month's appeal to the public to report hoarding of dangerous goods.

The Bureau Discovers Almost Every Day

Staff are sent out on patrol, assisted by the Municipal Fire Department and the Industrial Division. Flammable goods are hoarded, and hoarders are arrested almost every day and brought to the Special No. 1 Court. Due to the lenient penalties, it is insufficient to prevent them from continuing to hoard. For example, A stored 1,000 cans of kerosene without a dangerous goods license. After being discovered, he was escorted to the Special No. 1 Court and charged with violating Article 35 of the Land Regulations by-laws. The judge, based on Chinese law, sentenced him to a fine of 10 yuan. A did not take this small amount seriously and continued to hoard, and was arrested again. According to Chinese law, this time the fine increased to 40 or 50 yuan, but the amount was still small. It was not until the third time that the judge was able to prohibit him from selling the goods he had hoarded, but A could still ask B to hoard on his behalf. If B is arrested, he can only be sentenced to a fine of 21 yuan for the first time.

Legal Loopholes Awaiting Remediation

Furthermore, A can also change to hoarding other types of flammable goods. If arrested, he can only be counted as a first offender and fined 20 yuan. Even if A is arrested three times for hoarding one type of flammable goods, the period between his first and third arrests must not exceed six months. Therefore, although A has been charged twice with hoarding 1,000 cans of kerosene, he can still wait for six months and then hoard kerosene again, knowing that even if he is detained, he will only be counted as a first offender and fined 21 yuan. Because Chinese law has this loophole that benefits hoarders, the authorities of the International Settlement currently find it difficult to know how many flammable goods are stored within the Settlement without a dangerous goods license and have not been able to take strict action to eliminate them. The authorities of the French Concession have greater power to eliminate fire hazards, because the French law allows the authorities to immediately confiscate flammable goods.

### Bureau Regulations for Storing Dangerous Goods Yesterday

The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice stipulating that anyone storing dangerous liquids or solids must first obtain a license from the Council before proceeding. License application forms can be obtained from the License Issuance Section of the Rates and Taxes Department of the Council at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road. The nature of the dangerous goods must be clearly and truthfully stated. The premises or locations for storing dangerous goods must be inspected and approved by the Council. Furthermore, after the license is approved, a transportation permit must also be obtained from the Fire Brigade before the dangerous goods can be transported to the approved premises or locations for storage. The dangerous goods that require a license before storage include the following:

·Alcohol·Acetic acid·Pentacarbonyls. Petroleum ether·Carbon disulfide Alcohol spirit fire·Collodion·Ethanol·Gasoline·Hydrochloric acid·Kerosene·Paint. Methyl acetate·Petroleum ether·Nitric acid·Rubber cement·Sulfuric acid·Methyl alcohol·Resin·Lacquer·and many other flammable and dangerous liquids, aluminum powder·Ammunition·Any kind of explosive weaponry·Calcium carbide·Celluloid·Potassium cyanate·Any metallic cyanate smokeless gunpowder·Explosives·Priming powder·Blast·Bamboo·Detonating fuse·Guncotton·Blasting gelatin magnesium·All nitrates·Perchlorates·Yellow or white phosphorus·Picric acid·Potassium·Potassium cyanide Potassium nitrate·Sodium·Sodium peroxide·Sodium hyposulfite·Sulfur·Zinc ash·and many other dangerous substances.

### All Sectors Hoist Flags Today to Celebrate the Birthday of the Founding Father; Citizens Emulate the Revolutionary Spirit of the Founding Father and Promote the Movement of Thrift, Savings, and Donations to Relieve Hardship

Today is the anniversary of the birth of Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father and Premier. All sectors of Shanghai will hoist flags and take a holiday to celebrate enthusiastically, while simultaneously continuing to promote various movements of thrift, savings, and donations for disaster relief, to fulfill their civic responsibilities. Details of each situation are recorded as follows:

Today is the anniversary of the Founding Father's birthday. Although commemorative ceremonies are suspended in Shanghai due to the special circumstances, all sectors will hoist the national emblem high and celebrate enthusiastically in accordance with the eight-day flag-raising arrangement for the whole year agreed upon by various public organizations and the Concession authorities. At the same time, all government agencies, public organizations, schools, banks, money shops, and various industry markets will also take a holiday as usual to commemorate this great festival. Various public organizations also sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang to express their respect and vowed to support national policies with utmost sincerity.

Citizens from all walks of life, in order to commemorate the Founding Father's creation of the Republic of China and emulate the revolutionary spirit of the Founding Father, have resolved to work hard at their posts, increase their loyalty, and continue to promote the movement of thrift and savings to meet the needs of national construction and fulfill their national responsibilities. At the same time, prices in Shanghai are high, and starvation is rampant. Winter is fast approaching, and the situation will become even more serious. The jade-shattering disaster relief movement is also continuing to advance, determined to follow the spirit of offering clothing and food to provide assistance. In addition, the Municipal Party Headquarters issued a proclamation to the public with many words of encouragement.

Fasting to Mark the Anniversary of the Fall: Moreover, today is the fourth anniversary of the fall of Greater Shanghai when the National Army withdrew westward. As it coincides with the Founding Father's birthday, it has been decided to postpone the commemoration to the following day. Therefore, tomorrow, all sectors will solemnly commemorate the tragic past, and citizens will voluntarily suspend entertainment and banquets, and fast for one day to show their determination not to forget this day.

### "March of Generalissimo Chiang" to be Broadcast This Morning

The "Free Voice" column of the Zhengyan Daily recently received a record of the "[March of Generalissimo Chiang]" donated by the Chongqing Central Broadcasting Station. Today, on the anniversary of the Founding Father's birthday, the newspaper has specially entrusted the record to the local Democratic Radio Station to broadcast to fellow Shanghainese. The time is 7:30 this morning. It is hoped that fellow compatriots will respectfully listen to it on the radio at that time.

### The Two Sisters of Xu Songyao Have Been Released by the Police; Rumor Has It that Xu Xiangsun Has Surrendered

The case of Xu Songyao, the young master of the Hua Mei Pharmacy, who was shockingly killed by his younger brother Xu Daquan with an axe, resulted in the arrest of the murderer Xu Daquan by the French Concession Police. Additionally, his two sisters, Jihua and Xihua, were detained for questioning, as reported in the previous issue. Now, it has been reported that the French Concession police completed their interrogation of Jihua and Xihua the day before yesterday and ordered them to return home, advising them not to leave far away for future questioning. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, the French Concession authorities went to the corpse inspection site on Route Tenant the afternoon before yesterday and photographed the skull of the deceased Xu Songyao (note: there are seven axe wounds on the back of the skull, which are vividly depicted, one and a half inches deep and one inch or half an inch shallow) along with the murder axe, placing them together as evidence. Rumor has it that Xu Xiangsun has already surrendered.

### Shanghai Catholic Social Service Group

With the continued abnormal development of the social situation in Shanghai today, social service, that is, the work of helping the social situation return to normal, is an urgent matter. Indeed, there are already many large and small organizations in Shanghai that exist solely for the purpose of seeking the welfare of social members. What I want to introduce now is a social service group that was established not long ago, whose expenses and services depend on the maintenance of its members, and which has achieved some work results. Its initiator is Father Rui, an English professor at Jin Ke Middle School, who started working in 1936, mainly visiting poor and sick compatriots. At that time, although there were only a few members, they were able to complete a part of the work. After the war, the number of poor, sick, and homeless people in Shanghai increased daily, and the need for social services became increasingly urgent. This group also expanded its scope with the needs of the times, and the number of members gradually increased. By 1940 and 1941, there were more than one hundred people, of whom more than thirty were very active workers. They are roughly divided into ten departments:

Sewing Group - Each week, members are responsible for repairing old clothes for distribution to the poor (to be continued)

### Public Bus Accidentally Injures Two Pedestrians

In order to avoid an oncoming vehicle, the bus suddenly drove onto the sidewalk there, causing it to hit pedestrians Qian Fugen (34 years old), who injured his leg, and Wu Lefa (37 years old), who injured his head. Subsequently, the police transported the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment and recorded the license plate number of the driver involved in the accident in order to investigate.

### Majestic Theater Continues to Hold Children's Carnival; One Toy is Enough for Free Admission

The Rotary Club, a well-known social organization in the local area, collects toys from all walks of life every autumn and winter, repairs them, and distributes them to poor children throughout the city during Christmas as spiritual relief. The intentions are good. Children's carnivals have already been held at the Nanjing and Majestic theaters on October 26 and November 9 respectively, and the results have been extremely satisfactory. Later arrivals almost couldn't find a seat, which shows the society's concern for disaster-stricken children. In order to further collect toys and give those who missed out in the past the opportunity to do good deeds, the club has decided to hold another children's carnival at the Majestic Theater this Sunday (16th) at 10:30 a.m. One or more toys can be exchanged for an admission ticket, with assigned seating, completely free of charge. Starting today, tickets can be obtained from the Rotary Club, Cathay Theatre, and Majestic Theatre. There may be crowding.

Commercial News

### The Grain Market Is Stagnant, and Some Retail Stores Are Not Selling; There Is a State of Uneven Joy and Suffering

Yesterday, the foreign rice market was still stagnant. Transactions that had not been concluded last week have not yet been priced, and new transactions are still expected. However, both rice merchants and banks are discussing solutions, and the Concession authorities are also taking measures to stabilize people's food. It is expected that there will be a reasonable resolution and a return to normal business soon. It is an overstatement to worry that the rice shops will not sell rice. The Shanghai Municipal Council has a large supply of Hong Kong rice for sale and has ordered rice shops to cooperate with it and purchase rice for the market as usual. However, some rice shops have sold out and are out of stock, and the problem of overcrowding by Jiangbei vendors and profiteers, the difficulty of purchasing for the general public, and the problem of delivering rice to densely populated areas need to be improved by the authorities to facilitate the entire city.

Yesterday's retail situation saw some still selling according to the government price, while others said they had no foreign rice and only social rice, which was worry-free and saved a lot of trouble. In fact, this kind of trickery should not be allowed. Rice shops are the most adept at taking advantage of loopholes. It is remembered that when the price of national rice was restricted in the past, they would not sell national rice, but only foreign rice. Now that the price of foreign rice is restricted, they will not sell foreign rice, but only sell du rice. In addition, they stop selling under the pretext that the rice has been sold out. The Concession authorities should start by selling the rice stored in warehouses in the rice market. If they only restrict the retail price, how much can the small rice shops store? This will inevitably force them to close down, and it is also not a way to maintain the people's livelihood to have the big rice shops keep the rice in the warehouses. May I ask how many rice shops can the Concession authorities have to meet the needs of the entire city? The most important plan for the Concession authorities today is to replenish the sources of each rice shop so that they can sell continuously. It is essential to order hoarders and large merchants to sell the rice stored in each warehouse in batches. If they do not sell it early and ignore the warnings from the Shanghai Municipal Council, it will be distributed to the rice shops for sale, and the proceeds will be used to pay for it. Rice shops that have no rice to sell can buy from the Shanghai Municipal Council and are not allowed to close down. However, one thing to note is that it is not fair to let the rice market be free while managing the rice shops. As for the rumor of searching households for rice storage, it is a joke and a fantasy. This is called harassing the people and failing to accomplish anything. It is opening the door to extortion and is likely the work of troublemakers who are taking advantage of this to do business.

Java foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Zhawawa Company's Zhibade postal ship arrived at port the day before yesterday evening. In addition to a large batch of sugar, there were also 910 bags of foreign rice transported from Java. (Zu)

The foreign flour trade, both overt and covert, has come to a halt. Those holding the goods want to sell but cannot, and those who need it are waiting to see if it will be sold at a publicly announced price, so they are standing by. However, before the public sale has begun, the owners of the goods are still reluctant to sell them at a reduced price. Kinryu brand Kan flour is still asking for 44-45 yuan. The trading of bran has been quiet for days. Yesterday, a batch was released by the factory, priced at 54 yuan, which is 3-4 yuan lower than the recovery price last week. The daily factory purchase price of wheat is still around 75 yuan. A large batch of foreign flour is being transported to Tianjin. Taikoo Company's Liangzhou ship will leave Shanghai for Tianjin this morning with 40,000 bags of foreign flour.

### Hoarding Oil Merchants Desperate to Unload

Market Price Drops Twenty to Thirty Dollars

Yesterday, the price of edible oil on the unofficial market dropped sharply. This was mainly because the authorities would soon implement management measures. Therefore, those who were hoarding oil were rushing to unload their stocks. The market price plummeted by another twenty to thirty dollars. Soybeans and other related products were also weak and unable to recover. The prices were as follows: Dalian soybean oil was priced at 375 to 350 dollars, Qingdao raw oil at 360 dollars, Dayou Factory refined oil at 235 dollars, rapeseed oil at 230 dollars, Yoshida Factory rapeseed oil at 235 dollars, Rihua Factory rapeseed oil at 230 dollars, paint factory rapeseed oil at 226 dollars, Tianjin Chen Jinyuan's at 103 dollars, Dutch yellow corn at 44 to 45.5 dollars, white corn at 44 to 46 dollars, and Saigon new corn for October loading at 83.5 dollars.

### Various Brands of Yarn Sold Off; Double Horse Experiencing Significant Rise and Small Correction

Although Covering Shorts Caused Uplift, Many Also Sold Off. After the sharp drop in yarn and cloth prices the previous day, prices rebounded yesterday. This was because short-selling was excessive. Buyers, seeing the prices as relatively cheap, and with the floral fabric merchants suddenly making purchases, a counter-movement occurred to cover short positions. Simultaneously, rumors in the market subsided, and confidence was stabilized. With an increase in buyers, the market gradually turned around. However, the market softened after opening in the afternoon as some traders unloaded miscellaneous brand yarn. The price of yarn traded on the exchange also fell by 20 to 50 dollars. Sellers were again active. Double Horse opened at 2,850 dollars and closed at 2,828 dollars. Today is the Premier's birthday, and the silver and money markets are closed, and the market is also closed for rest. Judging from the current situation in the yarn market, there may be a period of fluctuation.

The morning situation for Double Horse was still weak. The opening price for the first trade was 2,770 dollars, down 20 dollars. However, as soon as this trade opened, those covering short positions flocked in, the wind tightened, and the market gradually improved. Because the prices of yarn and cloth on the exchange rose together, Double Horse followed suit, rising to 2,945 dollars. Later, some profit-takers exited, and the price fell back to 2,870 dollars, fluctuating between 2,880 and 2,890 dollars for quite some time. The closing price was 2,890 dollars. It was found that 3,400 bales were traded in half a day.

The Double Horse futures market was volatile, and the trend was very unstable. This was because recent international developments have been uncertain, causing people to feel disoriented. The bullish sentiment has become a thing of the past, while the short sellers are cautious and have taken less action. The market initially rose and then fell, presenting a fluctuating picture. When it opened in the morning, the factory orders immediately rose, and people were quite excited. The futures yarn market rose, with the November contracts opening at 2,800 dollars, an increase of as much as 90 dollars. It then rose further to a high of 2,870 dollars. December opened at 2,980 dollars, an increase of 115 dollars, and then rose another 10 dollars. January opened at 3,000 dollars, up 80 dollars, and then rose to 3,035 dollars. The initial rise was entirely driven by covering shorts. As the last trades of the morning were being made, the market was already showing signs of weakness. The November contracts had fallen to 2,750 dollars, and the distant months had also fallen by 10 to 20 dollars. In the afternoon, the downward trend from the morning continued, and buyers were indifferent, mostly due to being hit by rumors. Also, because today is a holiday, there were many sellers. The market continued to be sluggish, with the near-term contracts closing at 2,700 dollars, down 10 dollars, December closing at 2,840 dollars, also down 25 dollars, and the January contracts closing at 2,940 dollars, still up 20 dollars. Today is Premier's birthday, a holiday. The following is a table.

### Stagnant Cotton Market

The current cotton market situation is weak, following the yarn market. However, while coarse cotton has fallen by 20 to 30 dollars, fine cotton remains firm. Trading was stagnant throughout the day. This is because there was little development in other commodities, and the general public adopted a calm wait-and-see attitude, leading to a complete absence of transactions.

The New York cotton market initially rose due to buying by dealers and Wall Street, but later fell back due to selling by Southern firms and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, yesterday's closing prices were down about 4 to 5 points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to active short-covering and strong domestic stock market. But afterward, it fell slightly because floating bulls sold and took profits. As a result, yesterday's closing prices each rose by 2 to 3 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market will fall by 2 rupees.

### Piece Goods Rebound Also Strong; Dragon Head Cloth Rises by Seven Dollars

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market fluctuated, and people were uneasy. As a result, there were mixed gains and losses for white goods compared to the previous day, while dyed cloth was flat. 16-pound Butterfly brand cloth was sold at 103 dollars in the morning, rose to 109.25 dollars at noon, fell back to 105 dollars in the afternoon, and closed slightly higher at 106 dollars in the evening, up 3 dollars compared to the previous day. Trading was extremely slow, with only over 200 pieces traded. There is a real need for easing in this street. Dealers are watching, and there is no hope for the development of customer sales.

Eastern Cloth: Initially rose, then fell. As a result, futures fine cloth rose by 4.6 to 5 dollars per piece. Dragon Head factory orders in the spot market rebounded strongly due to the previous series of sharp declines. It opened 5 to 6 dollars higher in the morning, with a peak of 104 dollars, and closed in the afternoon at 102 dollars, up 7 dollars per piece.

The situation was very strong, as banking firms continued to buy. Dafeng and Defu each bought 2,300 to 500 taels, but Xianghe and Tianyuan each sold more than 1,000 taels. Other firms such as Yongcheng also had more supply than demand. The supply of cash was not too short, and the price rose from 20,400 to 870 dollars, then fell back, and finally closed up 350 dollars. The transaction was over 13,000 taels in the half-day. No deals outside the market were heard in the afternoon. Jewelry gold rose by 30 dollars, reaching 2,100 dollars.

### Black Market Foreign Exchange Selling, Fewer Positions

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the central and HSBC listed prices did not fluctuate. Qingfeng and other small exchanges' prices did not change. In the British and American exchange black market, selling positions became fewer, and there were few market prices that could be settled or sold at a fixed price. The British exchange traded at two pence. It was heard that Chinese merchants had sold thousands of pounds to import foreign firms. The US dollar was strongest at 2.9375 dollars, and was offered for sale. It soon softened to 2.875 dollars. Some import foreign firms that were not allowed to apply settled. There was no change in the afternoon.

The trend of Hong Kong notes was stable, and the market price did not change. Japanese and Korean gold notes both trended lower. Both retreated to 3.85 dollars.

### Public Bonds Fluctuate; Possible for Gradual Rise

The public bond unofficial market was quite peaceful yesterday. However, Series A bonds suffered an unnecessary price drop because Lianhe was eager to sell. Currently, among the various market prices, Series A is still the cheapest. Compared to Series C, it is only 6.5 dollars cheaper. Compared to the previous difference of over 10 dollars, it is now about 4 dollars cheaper. It is feared that some may collect Series A bonds because their term is short and the number of drawings will continue to increase. As for the trend of various bonds, they may gradually rise because there is no change in the environment, and there may be a rapprochement in the US-Japan talks. In the morning, Tongshen, Tongkang, and Yuxing bought, and Yitai and Yiji sold. Series C fluctuated between 2 and 3 points. The initial opening price of Series A was the same as the previous day, initially only opening at 2 to 3 points. Later, due to Lianhe's sudden sale, the market suddenly saw a sharp decline because there were no buyers at the time, breaking 72 dollars and seeing a small price of 1.4 dollars, down 1 dollar from the previous day. The situation strengthened in the afternoon. Series C saw a high price of 9.6 dollars, and Series A also recovered more than half a dollar. Hongda and Xiexingyuan bought, and Yitai and Dahua sold. As a result, high and low prices were mixed, with a difference of only 2 to 3 points. The turnover was about 2.1 to 2.2 million dollars. Today is Premier's birthday, a holiday. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day
National A 3.40 71.40 72.05 Down 0.25
National B 67.50 67.10 67.35 Flat

In stock trading, 50 shares of Mingxing Perfume Factory shares were traded, with a price of 170 dollars per share.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stock market was extremely busy. The opening price was firm, but soon softened. Then it rose again. Although there was a downward trend in the afternoon, there was no large-scale sell-off, so the decline was limited. Due to the holiday, buyers were also very cautious in their actions.

### Sugar Market Highly Volatile

Yesterday, the sugar market initially rose due to tension in the Pacific region. Both futures and spot raw white sugar rose by varying amounts, from 15 to 20 dollars. By the afternoon, however, prices fell back as hoarders rushed to sell. As a result, the prices dropped by a few dollars to over ten dollars. The company's raw white sugar for the 20th, morning opening at 295 dollars, closing at 86.5 dollars, highest at 303 dollars, lowest at 182 dollars. The afternoon opening price dropped to 75 dollars, then to 70 dollars. The 30th, morning opening at 315 dollars, closing at 296 dollars, highest at 315 dollars, lowest at 196 dollars.

Hong Kong raw 260 to 54 dollars. Afternoon 50 to 40 dollars. Dutch red 250 to 40 dollars. Afternoon only 25 dollars. In total, over 53,000 packages of futures and spot sugar were traded. There were also 41,996 bags of red and white sugar brought by the Shiba Te.

A large quantity of granulated sugar arrived continuously. The Java Company's Shiba Te Mail Ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 10th), transporting 4,500 tons of granulated sugar, approximately 45,000 bags, from Java. It docked at the Lan Yantong Wharf for unloading. It is heard that the Zhisha Road will arrive in Shanghai today, also with a large quantity of granulated sugar. This morning, the Taikoo Company's Liangzhou Wheel, which exported from this city, loaded 10,000 packages of granulated sugar to Tianjin.

### Turtle Shell Firm and Expensive

Turtle shell sales have been gradually increasing, so the price is quite firm. Recently, it opened at over 160 dollars, a doubling of the price compared to today last year. The market still has tight momentum.

### Dried Lily Bulbs Gradually Rise

Dried lily bulbs have been scarce recently, and the goods in the producing areas have mostly been bought up. The goods are also limited. The previous market price here was only around 110 dollars, which was cheap compared to other goods. Therefore, hoarders have absorbed quite a bit, although the quantity is not large, but they are unwilling to sell. The recent market has suddenly tightened, with prices increasing by 40 to 50 dollars. Only a small number of supplies are allowed to be given, and the market is bound to rise again.

### Black Iron Sheets and White Lead Wire All Rise Sharply

The market for black iron sheets of various colors, such as Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8, is excellent and has not declined. Recently, the market price for colors such as Nos. 5 and 6 is 600 dollars per load, while No. 7 is selling for 650 dollars, and No. 8 even requires 700 dollars.

The transaction volume of white lead wire has been quite active recently. Because the price of new lead wire is expensive, buyers are all changing to buy white lead wire. Therefore, the daily transaction volume is often several hundred loads, and the people holding the goods are naturally confident. Currently, Nos. 8 to 16 are 450 dollars per load.

### Market for Native Nails Gradually Declines

The price of native nails from this factory recently soared from around 200 dollars to over 300 dollars, and the hoarding merchants in this street have a huge appetite for absorption. The dismantling of goods among dealers is also lively. Since the day before yesterday, because the market has calmed down slightly, and the hoarding merchants have some intention of selling, there are more inter-dealer transactions. The market price for standard large factory goods was found to be 335 dollars per bucket, and the price for small factory goods was 230 dollars per bucket. These are the prices at which dealers sell. Goods that are urgently needed to be sold must be reduced by tens of dollars.

### Commemorating the Birthday of the Founding Father of the Nation

— Yugong

Today is the anniversary of the birth of the Founding Father of the Nation. Thinking back to the Founding Father's lifelong dedication to revolution and the founding of the Republic of China, his great achievements and virtues are admired both at home and abroad. On this day, in the fifth year of the Chinese nation's struggle for justice and freedom, all citizens should have the determination to follow his teachings, be united in mind and heart, and see things through to the end.

The Founding Father said, "Life is for service, not for plunder." The national crisis is not over, and Shanghai is not a place for enjoyment. We hope that those who are profiting from the national crisis will repent sincerely.

The Founding Father said, "Choose what is good and hold fast to it, and see it through to the end." This teaches the people to distinguish right from wrong and to be persistent in the face of setbacks. We hope that everyone will be in awe of justice and be a new national of the era.

The Founding Father said, "The more setbacks, the more we strive; try again and again." In the process of building the Republic of China, the Founding Father was always blazing a trail and did not spare himself any effort, until he passed away. He did not get a moment's rest. Today, the country is still in the midst of arduous construction. We hope that every citizen will serve the country and the nation with a spirit of perseverance.

The Founding Father suggested reform of the heart in psychological construction. As we commemorate the birth of the Founding Father of the Nation, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, we must all have a pure heart, a warm heart, and unite to become a great Chinese nation, a whole and excellent national character.

Commemoration is not just commemoration; it should be worthy of the Founding Father's teachings and fulfill the duties of a citizen.

### Warehouse Manager

— Zhang Gong

In layman's terms, a warehouse manager is someone who looks after the storage. In the past, this was a leisurely job, like a teacher, where some elderly people would spend their retirement. However, nowadays, there are more patterns, more frequent inflows and outflows, more serious procedures, and more meticulous management. Therefore, many warehouses have many young managers in their midst.

The receipt and payment of goods in the warehouse must have records with vouchers. When someone wants to stack goods in the warehouse you manage, you must first ask for the name, grade, quantity, tonnage, and volume of the goods in order to prepare the location. If there is not much space, it is best to refuse. An old maid who can't get married is what every warehouse manager has a headache about. At the end of the month, a report must be copied, and in moldy weather, it must be turned over, and the losses are even greater. - The handling fee collected by warehouse personnel from customers is reduced - the warehouse office also gets a few percent -

The loss of dredging of the Wusong River, Shanghai has occasional water disasters, which affects the goods on the lower floors of the warehouse, and any manager pays close attention to it. Although waterproof work is readily available in every home, the effect is minimal, so in addition to steel plates, silver dollars, and iron drums, more lightweight items are sent upstairs - that is, to the top floor - this thing has also been one of the important issues in warehouses in the past two or three years.

The wind of hoarding has spread throughout the city, and the life of a warehouse is not bad. The authorities have repeatedly increased rents, and the group of people who are stockpiling are still flocking here, and because the location is more in demand, the people upstairs are more humble and treat them with preferential treatment. In the meantime, warehouse managers can often use the opportunity to buy things that are not easy to buy at market prices.

The most frightening and depressing thing for a warehouse manager is the word "idle". Free leisure, eight rounds of mahjong, movie theaters, dance parties, or running on the road, sitting in the park, or else, going back to your hometown to hug your children, and you don't feel that time is difficult to pass, but the office hours have not passed, you have to be by the writing desk and at the warehouse door, sitting down to doze is not decent, standing and walking around can't get away, you can always take a book to read, you can always fall into a drowsy sleep, get ready to play jokes with your colleagues! It's also boring when there are few people, so on cloudy days and in the long summer, there is a phenomenon of restlessness and mixed feelings. The boredom that this word "idle" adds to us cannot be understood by those who are not in the know.

The air in the warehouse is quite turbid, and dust flies everywhere. The environment makes it a habit, and you don't notice it, but your clothes are just dirty. It's good that it's a woolen product, which can withstand it and be dusted off, and sometimes mud and oil stains are accidentally wiped on, so you have to pay attention all the time, right? Then, how should you do it when you are at the office? You can't be afraid of getting dirty and back away, so this woolen product is most suitable for our use. The meals in the warehouse are supplied from the outside, and all kinds of fire are forbidden from entering the door. You have to rely on the meal delivery service. In this day and age, rice is expensive, vegetables are expensive, labor and bowls are all expensive, so even if you increase the meal money, the side dishes are still not good, and sometimes you even hear the meal delivery boss sighing that he is not making any money.

### Zhou Sisters' Chinese Painting Exhibition

— Huang Baowu

My Fujian Zhou Ximin's concubine, Zhou Shushen Shaoxi, and her niece, Ms. Zonghui, are from noble families and are proficient in painting. In their early years, they accompanied their family on official travels and asked for advice from many teachers in the north and south. For more than ten years, they have been studying hard at their desks, and their accomplishments are especially pure. They excel in all kinds of painting, including landscapes, flowers, birds, insects, and fish. Their divine creations are unique. Recently, they intend to present their achievements to the world. From November 13th to 19th, there will be an exhibition for a week at the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company. It is hoped that elegant scholars from all over the world will jointly assess them, recognize the value of painting like the harmony of musical instruments, jointly study the eight methods of painting, and appreciate the two difficulties together. We await your arrival and dare to lead the way.

### Unpleasant Advice

— Zhigang

Recently, a certain industrial factory appealed to all sectors of society to maintain legitimate business operations and prevent illegal hoarding and manipulation. This can also be said to be a piece of advice aimed at the current speculative market. Here are some excerpts. Although faithful words are offensive to the ear, it is still hoped that this will serve as a warning. "In recent years, Shanghai's floating capital has been overflowing, everything is abnormal, and production has decreased. Limited products are supplied to insatiable searches... Therefore, we have to make corresponding restrictions in order to stabilize the market. We can continue to contribute to society, and the livelihoods of thousands of employees can be maintained. In this time of wind and rain, we are making a plea not to drain the pond to catch all the fish. We earnestly ask for your help in our humble distress... so that this precarious and difficult industry can be maintained and continued, and will not be destroyed at once. This is all thanks to society."

### One Cannot Lose Both Fish and Bear's Paw

— Qian Changnian

Mr. Someone is a teacher at School A and also holds a teaching position at School B at night. He uses both his hands and mouth and travels on foot, which leads to overwork, and his eyebrows and hair are thinning. His wife is worried about him and advises her husband to give up one of the two jobs in order to maintain his health. So the couple calculated the income and expenditure accounts for the past few years. The result proved that if they relied solely on the income from School A, they would have run out of food two years ago; if they relied solely on the salary from School B, they would have starved to death two years and five months ago.

After a bitter smile, the husband sighed and said that this matter was not worth discussing.

### Yelling About Selling Counterfeit Goods, Committing Assault and Robbery - Please Pay Attention to Avoid Being Deceived

I found that at 9:00 a.m. on November 3rd, I passed by a bed factory in front of the North-East Xinqiao intersection on Aiduya Road. There was a bamboo basket on the sidewalk containing cotton and wool undershirts, and four or five people wearing short shirts or long robes were shouting to sell returned goods for one dollar each. However, one of the people wearing robes pretended to be a buyer to lure people into the trap. I was unaware of the dark secret and bought four pieces. I paid with a five-dollar bill, and they used the excuse of changing the bill. I was not suspicious, so I took out a ten-dollar bill from my bag. They dared to forcibly rob me without saying anything. I knew things were not good and insisted on not letting go of the bill. They suddenly punched me hard in the chest, and I retreated uncontrollably, causing the bill to be torn. At that time, I didn't feel any pain in my chest. Besides, I still had more than 400 dollars in my bag. I looked around and didn't see any police officers, so I had to admit my bad luck and leave quickly. Unexpectedly, halfway through, the chest that was hit was extremely painful, and I couldn't breathe. Only then did I realize that the injury was not light. I think that in broad daylight, there are such lawless people who use this trick to harm people. In addition to sending a special letter to the Central Police Station, I would like to respectfully submit this to your publication to avoid deception of the public. Respectfully submitted by Liu Qichang, Editor of the Shen Bao Newspaper.

### Not Monotonous at All

A person asked a post office clerk, "Why don't you feel monotonous doing the same thing every day?" The post office clerk replied, "Not monotonous at all. The date on the postmark is different every day."

Fourteen The Life of a Fallen Hero

"I'm sorry, please forgive me, sir!" He held the broken robe and said tremblingly, "Because it's my first time here, I really didn't know, please..."

That person looked at him so pitifully carefully, smiled slightly coldly, raised his head, and walked elsewhere.

"Alas!" Qiu Haitang couldn't help but sigh softly. He thought that when he used to go backstage, whether in the north or in the south, there was always a special dressing room. He really didn't want to hang his clothes on this kind of clothes hook! Besides, what's so great about a martial arts performer? In the beginning, they weren't even qualified to talk to me, how dare they put on such a fierce expression!

In fact, the reason why this martial arts performer put on such a fierce expression on him was not for himself, but for the sake of the martial arts supervisor.

This martial arts performer's name was Zhang Yincai, and his skills were very good, but his temper was too bad. Few people in the troupe were on good terms with him. He had been a martial arts performer for seven or eight years, but he never got the chance to be a martial arts supervisor. Recently, he had a falling out with the martial arts supervisor due to a financial dispute. (260)

### Speaking of the Datong Society: Songs Shanghai People Need to Hear

— Xu Na

Popular Music Not in Line with the Trend; National Consciousness Inspires the Public

The Datong Society, which holds the reins of the singing world, has been established for four or five years. It used to be composed of Yao Min, Yao Ying, Yao Li, etc., and could simply be called the Yao siblings class. Now, Yao Ying has long since withdrawn and gone to Hong Kong. For a time, Man Ping, Du Jie, Chen Qi, etc. joined. But now only Yao Min and Yao Li remain as pillars, and Miss Liang Ping, who recently joined. Since violin expert Chen Qi withdrew, most of the music has been solo acts, so as an old listener, I hope there will be a few more musicians to achieve a more perfect state. When the Datong Society broadcasts, there are always many listeners who call or write to request songs and praise, especially letters, which is unique in the Shanghai broadcasting industry. On average, each program receives three or five letters and five or six calls. Some say Yao Li is the Oriental MacDonald, and some say she is China's number one singer, always doing their best to praise. Indeed, Yao Li's singing voice can be said to be unique in the singing world. And the number of records she has recorded can be called the crown of singers. New records such as "Aiya Ya" and "Heaven and Earth" are even more beautiful to listen to. In addition to broadcasting four programs on three major radio stations, she also sings at the Xianle Dance Palace after 10:30 pm. She has made guest appearances in movies such as "Love Song" in "Black Paradise" and "Rose Rose I Love You" in "Songstress of the End," which can also be said to be very successful. In addition, Yao Min's composition is even more of a perfect match. His successful works, such as "Tears of Longing," "Beauty Under the Moon," "I Love Mom," and the recent "Happiness Arrives," have all been recorded, and can be said to be household names. It is said that Yao Min will marry a certain lady in the near future, and there will definitely be an unprecedented sensation in the singing world at that time. I hope that all the ladies and gentlemen of the Datong Society will compose and sing more songs with connotations and meanings. As the editor of this magazine said on Double Ten Day: "Taking the promotion of national consciousness as the warp and the infusion of loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness as the weft," so as not to be ridiculed as decadent music. This is what our listeners hope.

### The Zombie's Revenge

— Xu Bo

A Collection of Domestic Films

"Deep Night," "Black-Clothed Thief" raids "Xiangsi Village" to steal "Fragrant Concubine." It rained. At that time, there was "Dangkou Knight," who heard the "Gunshots in the Rainy Night" and rushed to the scene, but the concubine was already dead. Her soul entered "Modern Hell," saw "Ksitigarbha," but did not stay, and then entered "Black Paradise," where she met "Snow White" who pitied her "Peerless Beauty" and "Fallen Rose." She was told that there was "Resurrection Incense" in the "Ancient Country of Human Demons," which could "resurrect" her. So she went to beg for it, but was refused. She used a "beauty trap," but accidentally ate a "fig" and turned into a "female zombie." So she hid in "Peach Blossom Lake" and sang sad songs at night. Nearby, in "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," there was a "Romantic Emperor" who heard the "Midnight Song" and searched for the sound, only to find that it was a "female ghost," an extraordinarily beautiful "Seductress." They exchanged glances and "laughed three times" and then began a "ghostly love," practicing "the way of husband and wife," and giving birth to two daughters, "Bilo Princess" and "Iron Fan Princess." They only thought it would be "forever," but they did not know that "Silver Spear Thief" and "Huang Tianba" rebelled and attacked "Yanmen Pass." The defending general, "Robin Hood," was no match because the thieves had "new invisibility techniques," so he committed suicide to "serve the country with loyalty." There was "Jiangnan Little Knight" who invited "Charlie Chen to break the invisibility thief." The rebel army's military advisor, "Living Buddha Jigong," had a treasure, "Understanding Flower," which turned the emperor into "Peacock Flies Southeast," and the two daughters into "Red Butterflies." The concubine felt "parting from life and death," sighed "regretting parting," and had no choice but to flee to the square. After killing the concubine, the black-clothed thief avoided Shanghai and spent his "Island Spring and Autumn," cohabitating with "Little Women" and "New Camellia Girl," and also living with "Merry Widow" and "Li Sanniang." During a "carnival of" flesh "desire," the concubine suddenly appeared, and both sides became "inseparable mandarin ducks" and died. "Confucius" wrote about this event and made it into a book, titled "The Zombie's Revenge."

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Mingdao Kou

Chapter 19: Dusk, Nomad Cavalry, Dust Filling the City

Zhang Cangqiu and others felt softened in their hearts after hearing Chai Ying's sincere words. Especially Zhang Cangqiu; his friendship with Chai Ying was very good. He had come here to join the army, and Chai Ying had vigorously promoted him. Now that he was leaving quietly, Chai Ying had chased after him to persuade him to stay, and he didn't seem to be able to say that he was leaving. So he said straightforwardly: "We were originally prepared to leave, but since Brother Chai is persuading us like this, if we insist on not listening, we will be accused of not knowing how to appreciate favors. Okay, we will stay with General Wu for the time being and see what happens later. I hope that what we have predicted will not come true, and that will be the blessing of the country." Chen Fei and Xu Jing saw that Zhang Cangqiu had already decided to stay temporarily, so they naturally agreed without objection. Only Liu Yinying frowned slightly, and although she did not speak, she seemed very unwilling to stay any longer. However, since everyone had decided not to leave, she could not say that she wanted to leave. Chai Ying was happy to see that Zhang Cangqiu and others had agreed not to leave, so he stood up with them and said, "Let's go back and have a few drinks." The four of them followed him out of the pine forest, mounted their carved saddles, and returned to the Jiumenkou camp. Chai Ying wanted to treat the four to drinks. Zhang Cangqiu said: "Brother Chai came to the pass from Ningyuan this time, and logically we should give Brother Chai a wash-dust banquet. How can we let Brother Chai be the host? This is my treat. There is a Wanhua Building in the town, and the wine and dishes are good. Let's go there today. I'm hungry enough." Chai Ying knew Zhang Cangqiu's temperament, so he didn't bother to be polite with him. The five of them then left the camp gate and went to Wanhua Building, chose an elegant seat and sat down, and drank wine heartily. Everyone talked about the situation of the bandits and the Qing soldiers. Zhang Cangqiu drank the most wine and spoke the most. (126)

### Random Notes from the Pear Garden

— Cunren

Before Huangjinhou team, Xi Xiaobo, and others arrived in Shen, the "Shanghai Opera School" and amateur circles performed together for several nights, and all the students of the school will go to Hong Kong to perform.

The newly created "Zhonghua Opera School" is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony on the 15th.

(10) Zheng Bingru

Zheng Bingru was a Kun role of little fame before she came to Shanghai; but since she joined the Gengxin Stage, her reputation has suddenly increased, surpassing her peers and striving to keep pace with the so-called leading roles of the older generation. She has a well-proportioned figure, a melodious voice, and can sing demanding operas. She lacks nothing in terms of natural talent, and she is like a shadow of Xue Yanqin in her early years, so it is naturally easier for her to gain fame. Moreover, her plays still strive for correctness and integrity, and she looks like a Qingyi role (it is now difficult to find a Kunling who can be said to resemble a genuine Qingyi, which is why Zheng Bingru is so valuable). If she has the ambition to advance and specializes in the Qingyi path, then the journey of a thousand miles will be reached in an instant, without much effort. There are really too few Kunlings whose timbre is as beautiful as Zheng Bingru's. Those who unintentionally obtain such fine qualities and appreciate opera should fulfill their responsibility of encouraging and urging her.
