### US Aid to China Agreement on War Supplies Expected to Be Signed This Week; Soviet Union Provides Assurance to the Chinese Government That It Will Continue to Ship Various Supplies to China

Washington (Reuters) - Reliable sources indicate that the Sino-American agreement on aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act could be signed before the end of this week. (Reuters, 17th)

Moscow - Reliable sources here reported yesterday that Shao Lizi, the Chinese Ambassador to Moscow, met with Molotov. (Chongqing sources state that Moscow has assured the Chinese government that its policy towards China remains unchanged, which was relayed to the Chinese government by the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union.) (United Press, 17th) Chongqing - Extremely reliable sources disclosed to United Press yesterday that the Soviet Union had assured Chongqing that its policy towards China would not change due to the Soviet-Japanese treaty. The Soviet Union will continue to ship various supplies to China. After the signing of the Soviet-Japanese treaty, the Chinese government telegraphed an inquiry to the Soviet Foreign Ministry, which replied with this assurance. (United Press, 17th)

Washington - News from Chongqing that the Soviet Union has notified China, stating that the Soviet-Japanese agreement does not affect aid to China, has been received here with satisfaction and is not considered surprising. The phenomenon of the Soviet Union aiding China on one hand and negotiating with Japan on the other is viewed here as normal behavior for the Soviet Union in today's chaotic political situation. However, this phenomenon is clearly no more confusing than the Japanese situation, where Japan shakes hands with the Soviet Communist Party while fighting against the Chinese Communist Party. People here feel that since Japan and the Soviet Union each have such peculiar backgrounds, it is not difficult to guess the sincerity of their agreement. Therefore, many observers believe that this treaty does not guarantee the security of the Manchurian border. Without this security, Japan cannot transfer large numbers of troops, but can only strengthen its army in China or use it elsewhere in Asia to develop its adventurous actions. Although the real reason for the signing of the Soviet-Japanese treaty is not yet clear, the general consensus is that this treaty does not greatly change the situation in the Pacific or East Asia. Secretary of State Hull's statement that the significance of this treaty should not be overestimated seems to grasp the truth of the situation. In reality, this treaty has damaged Soviet-American relations, as the State Department's feelings towards the Soviet Union have changed almost overnight. This is evident in the reception scheduled to be held by the Soviet Embassy in the United States on Sunday, as many State Department officials who had already accepted invitations to this reception will now not attend. (Reuters, 17th)

New York - A local radio station recently broadcast news that, according to sources in Chongqing, the Soviet government has notified Chairman Chiang Kai-shek that although the Soviet Union has signed a treaty with Japan, it will still continue to aid China. (Havas, 16th)

### The Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact Is Not Directed Against Any Country

New York - American newspapers commented extensively on the importance of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact to the international situation. An Associated Press correspondent in London stated that the agreement is not intended to target any country in the East or West. The two countries have no obligations other than strictly maintaining neutrality. (TASS, 17th)

Berlin - The full text of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, released by the German Information Bureau, was published in all newspapers here. According to the bureau, the German side believes that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact greatly contributes to consolidating world peace. The Berliner Tageblatt stated, "The adjustment of Soviet-Japanese relations has been properly assessed by Germany." The Deutsche Diplomatisch-Politische Korrespondenz stated, "Several problems in Soviet-Japanese relations that have existed for years have now been eliminated. The German side welcomes this development." (TASS, 17th)

### Japan's Attempts to Advance Southward Are Difficult to Achieve Due to Restraints from China, the United Kingdom, and the United States

Madavia - A Dutch newspaper commented on the Soviet-Japanese pact, stating it does not believe Japan will attack southward because Japan is still constrained by the American fleet in Hawaii, Singapore, and the war in China. The newspaper stated that it was commenting on the pact at the request of readers to see its reaction. The newspaper stated, "We do not believe that the improvement of Japanese-Dutch relations will lead to an attempt to advance southward. On the surface, the opportunity for southward advancement has indeed increased significantly, but upon closer inspection, the pact does not guarantee the security of Japan's rear. We do not believe that Japan thinks the situation has changed because of the signing of the pact, because Japan's main obstacles, the American navy, Singapore, and the war in China, still exist." (United Press, 17th)

### The United States Repeatedly Sends Officials to Visit the Far East

Bangkok - The increasing number of senior American officials visiting Thailand and the Far East has attracted great attention here.

Major Jackson, the US military attaché in Bangkok, is currently in Burma with Mr. Crossthwaite, the British Minister to Thailand. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)

### Chongqing Newspapers Unanimously Praise US Military Aid to China

Chongqing - President Roosevelt's announcement that military aid to China is imminent has been prominently displayed in large characters by all newspapers. An editorial in the Ta Kung Pao stated that whenever a significant diplomatic event occurs in the Far East, the United States always has a timely expression and measure, which is truly an American spirit. In the current situation, if China and the United Kingdom fail, the United States will face disaster. There is no way to retreat, so it has no choice but to accelerate effective measures. Looking further into the future of the human world, the United States may have a special and important mission, which is to lead the world with the American spirit back into the light. To achieve this mission, the United States must fight against the current demons. The newspaper also stated that China cannot escape the responsibility of leading East Asia, and can only accomplish its mission through arduous battles. An editorial in the Shih Shih Hsin Pao briefly stated that China's resistance to Japan does not rely on others, but at the same time welcomes the assistance of all friendly nations, as it can gain endless encouragement in spirit and increase some combat power in practice. In this regard, China should express its gratitude for the United States' increased aid to China. However, since Japan signed a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union, it has no worries about its rear and can transfer troops from the north to advance southward. At this time, when the flames of war are about to spread in the Pacific, it seems insufficient for the United States to only provide military aid to China. Why not stop Japan before it launches an attack? (Havas, 17th)

Tokyo - Newspapers here are all commenting on the importance of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. The Danna Shimbun stated that the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact is an extremely important event. (TASS, 17th)

It is also reported that the Soviet ambassador will also mention the fate of the Baltic ships and the issue of sending more than 500 Baltic sailors back to their country. It is widely believed that the increasing seriousness of the German threat to the Dardanelles Strait must be of great concern to the Soviet Union, as some observers believe that the German advance towards this important strait may make the Soviet Union more receptive to the suggestion of improving relations with Britain. (United Press, 17th)

### The US Will Send Troops to Danish Greenland, Escorted by Warships; British Ships Can Enjoy Repair Privileges in the US

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters that the United States would send troops to Danish Greenland, escorted by warships, and that the island's coastal defense would also be managed by the Navy Department. (Havas, 17th)

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox told reporters yesterday that British ships coming to the United States for repairs will enjoy preferential treatment in US Navy shipyards. This may slightly hinder the US shipbuilding program, but he hopes that the realization of a two-ocean navy will not be delayed as a result. The British battleship HMS Malaya, which recently arrived in New York, is the first British ship to enter an American port solely for repairs. The possibility of US ships escorting ships to Greenland is not convenient to discuss at this time, but the US Navy has such a plan in mind, as any well-managed navy is prepared for all kinds of contingencies, and this is one of them. (Reuters, 17th)

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Knox said that the US government is studying the British request that the US take over commercial shipping routes in the Pacific. Knox said that the recent arrival of the British battleship HMS Malaya in New York "is the harbinger of a large number of British ships coming to our docks." Knox warned the public not to reveal the whereabouts of these ships to prevent loss of life and ships. Knox promised to keep the arrival of British warships in the United States strictly confidential, stating that British ships should now enter American ports under cover of darkness. Knox also warned newspapers and radio stations that they must cooperate, implying that if they do not cooperate, forced censorship will be imposed. (International News Service, 17th)

New York - The New York Commercial Daily reported that the Maritime Commission has requisitioned the mail ship Excalibur. It is generally believed that this is the first step in using several fast American freighters in the aid-to-Britain program. It is widely believed that some of the new fast ships built with funding from the Maritime Commission will be transferred to the United Kingdom under the Lend-Lease Act. The Robin Doncaster has recently been delivered, and several other fast ships currently at Atlantic ports will be received within days. It is reported that a merchant fleet will be organized to carry supplies to the war zone. (Reuters, 17th)

### Rumor That Japan Has Agreed to Provide Warships for German Use

Washington - Rumor has it that Japan has agreed to "lend" warships to Germany for use in attacking British ships in the Pacific. This news was raised at a meeting yesterday between US Undersecretary of State Welles, British Chargé d'Affaires Butler, and Australian Minister Casey to inquire with Butler. Butler replied, "This move is extremely serious. The Japanese are quite cautious. I don't think they would take this step." At the same meeting, Casey and Butler requested that the United States take over British shipping routes in the Pacific so that British ships could be withdrawn to transport supplies in the Pacific. Butler also said that British ships cannot break free in the Pacific, and this problem "urgently needs" to be solved. Shipping circles here said that the news of Germans driving Japanese ships is "ridiculous." It is said, "Everyone knows that the coastal warships of Japan are very small, and it is already not easy for Germans to fit inside, let alone drive them." It was also pointed out that various operating mechanisms are marked in Japanese, and the Germans' confusion in driving Japanese ships will be even greater than that of the British navy driving the German ships captured in Scapa Flow. They also laughed and said, "Japanese ships may have left-hand operating mechanisms. If the news is true, the German navy will face a major capability test." (International News Service)

### US Restricts Copper Prices

Editorial

### The Soviet-Japanese Agreement and Japan's Southern Advance

On the 13th of this month, the Soviet and Japanese governments published the full text of the neutrality treaty signed in Moscow. The world was in an uproar, analyzing and judging it from various angles, becoming the largest source of material for newspapers in various countries in recent days. We have no time to review them one by one, but our impression is quite different from theirs. Soviet newspapers are the most wonderful. Their views on this do not fall into the usual clichés, because they do not praise it as friendship between the two countries or pray for it as peace in East Asia, but directly point out that this is the result of Japan's understanding of the Soviet Union. Indeed, in this situation, the Soviet Union does have the qualifications to be so proud. However, to make such a statement before the envoy has even left the country seems too naive to observers, and those who hear it may inevitably feel insulted. US Secretary of State Hull is the most detached, believing that the world overestimates its importance. This newspaper is fortunate that its previous argument was not wrong, believing that the Soviet Union will not stop aiding China because of this, and Japan will not take this as an immediate factor in its southward advance. These two points are the accumulation of the world's concerns and indignation in the past five days, and after five days, they have gradually become clearer. At least, as reported in yesterday's telegram, the Soviet authorities have assured Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek that the policy of aiding China will absolutely not change, which has an even more clarifying and absolute effect.

As for the already existing problem of Japan's southward advance, we believe that the broad southward advance, such as political and economic advances, has already begun in French Indochina and Thailand. As for the military launch of a southward advance, it is narrow in scope. Japan, at least for now, does not have the courage or the strength for this, and it depends on the European war situation showing a clear German victory and British defeat. The Soviet Union and Japan have concluded a neutrality treaty, which does indeed legally relieve Japan of its worries about its northern rear. This legal aspect is unequivocally recognized by everyone, but everyone wants to fully reserve what is beyond the legal aspect. Moreover, the mechanism for formulating national policy and the basis for implementing national policy both transcend the scope of legal principles, and Japan has long hesitated to approach its southward advance due to concerns about its northern rear. Therefore, the mere fact that it no longer has legal concerns about its northern rear is not enough to conclude that Japan will therefore advance southward. Japan's international isolation in recent years has undergone a change in appearance due to the signing of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy last autumn. If one asks what actual benefits Japan has gained, the Japanese are silent. This treaty with the Soviet Union, in order to resolve the so-called China Incident and prepare for the so-called future of southward advance, seems to have a similar superficial brilliance. If one asks what this treaty ultimately contributes to what is aspired to, the Japanese will inevitably be silent again. After the facade is painted, isolation is still isolation. As for the close parallel policies adopted by Britain and the United States in the Far East after the Tripartite Pact, and the US statement of substantial aid to China and the Soviet statement of continued aid to China after the Soviet-Japanese treaty, these are merciless wounds after the facade is painted.

Of course, it is always progress and expansion from a southward advance still having worries about its northern rear to a southward advance having no legal worries about its northern rear. It is not permissible to regard it as equal to zero simply because it is only slightly better than nothing. Moreover, stating that Japan does not have the courage and strength for a southward advance only refers to the present and does not determine its entire future. Underestimating Japan, or underestimating any opponent, is not permissible, or we will repeat the mistakes of Italy towards Greece and Japan towards China. Furthermore, regarding the so-called "moment when a German victory and British defeat are clearly visible," even if we believe that Britain will ultimately be victorious, there are still many fragments and many opportunities that can be regarded as "a German victory and British defeat." Italy chose the timing of its participation in the war last year, and the timing it chose was one of the past fragments and opportunities. This lesson is painful enough, and this example is clear enough. The most ambitious hardliners in Japan differ from Mussolini only in degree. For this reason, what constitutes a German victory and a British defeat is for the Japanese to weigh and choose, and it is likely different from us. However, we sympathize with one saying that was reported yesterday: that a secret alliance was formed between Germany and Japan, and that the day German forces advance to the Suez Canal will be the day Japan begins military action against Britain. This saying is indeed confidential, that is, there is absolutely no way to prove whether there is a secret alliance between Germany and Japan and whether the contents of the secret alliance are as described. However, examining the facts and circumstances, it is credible. If one says that Japan has no sincere intention to side with Germany and participate in the war, or that Japan estimates that the German army will not be able to reach the Suez Canal, and thus the contents of the reported secret alliance are used to falsely appease Germany, there is no reason for us to object. Otherwise, we can no longer find a better time and conditions for Japan to participate in the war. The arrival of German forces on the banks of the Suez Canal is another fragment of a German victory and a British defeat; Japan's commencement of military action against Britain is the main form of the so-called southward advance.

Why do we sympathize with this saying? Japan, like any war-mongering country, takes minimizing sacrifices in exchange for maximizing gains as the ultimate principle. A complete Britain is not something Japan wants to bet everything on and confront. When Britain is divided into several pieces, it is precisely what Japan considers a "dog in the water," which it can hit and share a piece of. Britain is built on its navy. Although its fleet travels irregularly and gathers and disperses unpredictably, a rough division can be made into three areas: west of the Strait of Gibraltar, and the entire Atlantic Ocean; from Gibraltar to the Suez Canal, including the entire Mediterranean Sea; and west of the Suez Canal, and the Indian Ocean, and the Far East. Destroying British maritime hegemony is very difficult, something that only Hitler would think of. But once it is divided, Japan has a comparative advantage in naval power east of the Suez Canal. The time to strike is then! And the German-Italian forces are fighting in North Africa, winning several battles recently, and invading Egypt, truly advancing towards the Suez Canal. Britain is not pessimistic at this point. If Japan has a secret alliance with Germany as reported, then it is starting to tremble under the emotion of worrying about gains and losses, and being hesitant and fearful. Why tremble? Betting everything on the navy is a dangerous path. Although it has an advantage in dealing with a divided Britain, what about the United States?

### Northern Hubei, South of Dahong Mountain: Contending Battles Occur on the Periphery; Chinese Army Holds Key Strongholds; Fierce Fighting Frustrates Japanese Offensive

Chongqing: According to a war report from the Chinese army in Fancheng, Chinese and Japanese forces are currently contesting the vital points on the periphery of Dahong Mountain. A large number of Chinese troops are holding these key positions. The battle in the southern part of Dahong Mountain is ongoing. (Roadside telegram on the 17th)

Fancheng: The battle for the peripheral strongholds south of Dahong Mountain is intensifying. Qingfeng Mountain was captured by a certain Chinese regiment on the 13th at Chenshi (7-9 AM), but in the afternoon, the Japanese reinforced with over a thousand troops, coordinating with machine guns and artillery to launch a counterattack, resulting in fierce fighting. At Ershi (1-3 PM) on the 14th, another thousand-plus Japanese troops advanced to Kedianpo, invading Tongzichong and the Fenshuiling area to the north, engaging in fierce combat with the Chinese. The fighting subsided slightly at dusk, but the Chinese fiercely drove them back in the evening, launching a counterattack from the right flank. As of the morning of the 15th, Chinese and Japanese forces were still fiercely fighting near Bazhehe and Kedianpo. Furthermore, over a thousand Japanese troops advancing from Liulindian towards the southeastern foothills of Dahong Mountain were still being blocked by the Chinese army in the area of Liudian and Guchengfan. (Telegram on the 16th)

Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesperson announced today that the large-scale concentration of Chinese forces at Dahong Mountain has threatened the Japanese positions south of Zhongxiang and east of Suixian on the east bank of the Hanshui River. In order to eliminate the Chinese forces on Dahong Mountain, the Japanese forces in Zhongxiang and Suixian launched an offensive a week ago, with a force of 10,000, supported by aircraft and artillery. On April 10th, the Japanese troops in Zhongxiang advanced towards the southern foothills of Dahong Mountain in three routes. After the Chinese army repelled the left and central wings of the Japanese army, they immediately pursued the central route of the Japanese army towards the southeast. The Japanese right wing then launched a fierce attack on the 13th, hoping to support the central route of the Japanese army, firing 3,000 shells at the Chinese positions in one day. The two sides are currently contesting the key strongholds on the southern periphery of Dahong Mountain, and the fighting is very intense. The Japanese troops in Suixian shifted westward on the 13th, but after encountering strong resistance from the Chinese army, they turned south. The spokesperson believes that the Chinese army will be able to repel the Japanese offensive. (Reuters telegram on the 17th)

### Weekly War Situation: April 11th to 17th

A spokesperson for the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission said that the war situation this week was relatively quiet. Apart from the Chinese army in northern Jiangxi still working to clear the battlefield, only the Japanese army's so-called "Dahong Mountain Sweep" is worth reporting. The details are as follows:

Northern Hubei: Dahong Mountain has always been defended by the Chinese army during years of fighting. Last year, the Japanese army launched the Xiangdong Battle, but still failed to force the Chinese to leave the mountain. The Chinese army held this mountain, which could threaten Jingzhong to the south and flank Suixian to the east. Therefore, the Japanese finally felt unable to rest easy. Furthermore, in view of the successive defeats in western Hubei and northern Jiangxi, they wanted to gain something here to compensate for previous losses, so they rashly launched the so-called "Dahong Mountain Sweep." Their deployment was a pincer attack from the north and south. In the southern part of the mountain, Zhongxiang was used as a base, and on the morning of the 10th, they began to advance northward in three routes. One route had over a thousand men, with eight artillery pieces, attacking Chang'an from Anzi. Another route had over two thousand men, with four artillery pieces, attacking Xujiadian from Guniuling. Another route divided into the vicinity of Wangjialing and Shaojiatai. In the northern part of the mountain, Maping and Zhehe in Suixian were used as bases, and on the morning of the 12th, they also launched attacks in three or four routes. One route had over a thousand men, passing through Youshan, Huangjiapeng from Maping. Another route had over a thousand men, passing through Dakangpo and Hejiadian from Zhehe, to attack Sanwenhu. The other route reached the vicinity of Junchuan. The Chinese army had already made arrangements to counter the Japanese coming from the south with a fierce counterattack, forcing the Japanese to reinforce repeatedly, resulting in the contest for the high slopes of Qingfeng Mountain, Mao'erzhai, Shiziwei, and Nanzhuangtai continuing for more than ten rounds. Currently, they are still facing each other at Fenshuiling. The Japanese coming from the north were intercepted by the Chinese in the Sanwenhu, Hejiadian, and Guanzhuangdian area. Feeling the pressure of Chinese firepower, the Japanese retreated south towards Liudian and Guchengfan on the morning of the 14th. Currently, the Chinese army is expanding its victory. Another major victory is naturally expected. In addition,

Eastern Guangdong: After the Chinese army recovered Gongpingxu at 1:00 AM on the 13th, they simultaneously recovered Haifeng at 11:00 PM.

Southern Shanxi: Southeast of Lüxian, the Chinese army captured important strongholds such as Dongsangchi, Menghukou, Zaoniyi, and Lianhuachi on the morning of the 13th. The Japanese retreated to Xisangchi and Nanhe. The Chinese are in the process of annihilating them. Although these are all small-scale battles, the Chinese are constantly winning, accumulating small victories into large victories. This is exactly what it means. (Telegram on the 17th)

### Frontal Warfare has Commenced; Situation in Northern Greece Still Serious; Claim of Breakthrough in Allied Line by Axis Forces Dismissed as Baseless by British War Office

London: The British War Office announces that the German claim of a break in the Allied line in the Olympus Mountains, allowing them to directly enter the Larissa Plain, has not been verified by the Greek army or the British Command in Greece. However, fierce fighting is occurring on multiple sections of the Allied line. (Reuters telegram on the 17th)

London: The War Office declared yesterday that the Greek campaign now has the appearance of a "full-scale" battle as Allied and Axis forces are engaged in fighting along the entire front. Given the constant increase of German pressure, large-scale flanking maneuvers or an all-out assault are deemed inevitable. According to reports from Ankara, Germany has concentrated between 60 and 65 divisions in the Balkans, totaling roughly one million men, with 35 of those divisions coming from Bulgaria. The Greek army claims to have repelled German advances on both flanks, but due to the collapse of Yugoslav resistance, it is believed that German pressure will increase. However, guerilla warfare is expected to continue in the highlands. Military circles stated that while German pressure is increasing, reports from Ankara stating that German forces have broken through any Allied defense lines are baseless. (Associated Press telegram on the 17th)

Athens: The Athens Wireless Station announced yesterday that the battles west of Machi, which began on Sunday, are now progressing fiercely.

The radio station broadcasted a bulletin from the Greek Ministry of Information stating that the Greek forces have withdrawn to new positions in an orderly manner, without losses. British forces are cooperating with the Greek army, and have attacked and severely damaged German mechanized columns in multiple locations. Despite intense German attacks, the new Greek line has not been broken at any point. Although the situation in northern Greece remains serious, there is good reason to expect improvement. The Greek army on the Albanian front has repelled local Italian attacks, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The British Air Force has also achieved successes, heavily bombing German columns in transit and enemy supply bases. (Reuters telegram on the 17th)

### Bridge over Vardar River Destroyed by British Air Force

Athens: After the British Air Force destroyed a bridge over the Vardar River in the Vevi region of southern Yugoslavia, German forces have been halted in central southern Serbia.

When British pilots were ordered to attack the Vardar River bridge at night, they knew that the bridge was a major transportation hub in central southern Serbia and would be heavily defended. When the British planes arrived, German searchlights swept the sky and anti-aircraft fire was intense. However, none of the British bombers were damaged. One pilot circled four times through the fire, taking aim before dropping the bombs. The first batch of bombs destroyed the bridge, and the second batch hit nearby railway lines. Surrounding houses also caught fire after being hit by bombs.

### Soviet Union and Belgium Reach Agreement; Supply Wheat and Oil; French Ships Carry American Flour Back Home

London: The Soviet Union and Belgium have reached an agreement in Moscow that the Soviet Union will supply Belgium with a large quantity of wheat and oil over the next twelve months. This agreement has been approved by Germany and will greatly benefit Belgium, which is facing the most severe food shortage in Western Europe. British officials believe that the Soviet-Belgian agreement proves that the British official view that blockades must be applied to enemy-occupied countries is well-founded, firstly because it is Germany's responsibility to supply food to the occupied areas, and secondly because the firm attitude of the British led to the Soviet-Belgian agreement, which divided the food supply available to Germany to Belgium. It is reported that Belgium will supply the Soviet Union with mechanical products in return. (Reuters telegram on the 17th)

Rome: Authoritative sources here released a statement yesterday, stating roughly that after the German forces' fierce attack on the Balkans and the overthrow of Greece and Yugoslavia, the economic order of the Balkans in terms of supply will be greatly reformed. Although there are still countries in the Balkans that are at war or neutral, this economic relationship cannot yet be realized. However, the evolving developments in the Balkan Peninsula have created the possibility of establishing a new order, which is relevant to Romania's interests. Items such as olive oil, olives, rice, lemons, fish, textiles, cotton, silk, iron, lead, and copper can all be transported from Seville, Greece, and Turkey to Romania. Therefore, the cooperative relationship between Romania and the Balkan countries will become even closer in the future, proving the importance of Romania's political activities to the Axis powers.

### U.S. Investment in China Reaches 370 Million, Loans to China After the War Total $170 Million

Chongqing: According to statistics released here, U.S. investment in China, including the fourth decision to grant China a credit loan of ten thousand years in November of last year, totals $376,000,000 (excluding investment in Manchuria). (According to statistics from Professor Lehman of the University of Michigan, ten years ago, the total amount of U.S. investment in China was only $196,824,124, of which $155,112,778 was in commerce. The remainder was lent to the Chinese government, American churches, and charitable organizations, with assets of $43,071,289 not included. Since the Yangtze River flood in 1931, the United States first provided a wheat loan of $9 million, and then a cotton-wheat loan of $50 million to China. It also purchased 45% of the stock in China National Aviation Corporation. Therefore, when the statistics were recalculated in 1935, investment in China had reached $200 million, not including investment in Manchuria. In January 1938, the U.S. Department of Commerce released statistics showing that investment in China had increased to $202,000,000, including $40 million in assets of American churches and charitable organizations. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, American businesses have invested heavily in Free China.

European War Talk (4) (6)

### A Grand View of the United States Navy

The roaring cannons shake the heavens – this is what is called the final moment; everything else is just preparatory work. Apart from the "mouths" of the cannons, nothing else matters; the "mouths" are the 14-inch and 16-inch cannons installed on those battleships. In the midst of battle, the four turrets, each with three cannons, on the "Iowa" simultaneously bombarded the enemy; the intervals between the twelve deafening roars were extremely brief. Twelve crimson fireballs glided across the oil-green surface of the sea. When the cannons fired, the entire ship seemed to suffer a sudden impact and shook violently. As the 120-ton cannons recoiled six feet, the entire ship would be shaken and would list sideways on the water. A minute later, the two tons of gunpowder and steel would hit the enemy ship fifteen miles away.

Tactically, the commander-in-chief has done everything he possibly can. Now it depends on his gunners to sink the enemy ship before their own is sunk. In the high observation tower on the ship, the crew directing the bearings are firmly "fixed" on the enemy ship, constantly turning the bearing wheel, making sure there is no deviation. Deep in the hidden part of the ship's belly, in a small, brightly lit war operations room, officers are carefully calculating the trajectory, bearings, velocity, and target angle of the cannon fire. The commander-in-chief stands on the bridge, clenching his teeth, intently observing whether his own ships have suffered damage, and also paying attention to the extent of the enemy's damage, in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop.

All the numerical results calculated in the observation tower and war operations room are transmitted by electric motors to the dials in the four turrets. The personnel inside then turn the turrets according to the indicated degrees and elevate the cannons to the exact position. In that instant, the ship maintains its level, aimed at the enemy ship. The personnel in the command tower press the button, and all the cannons fire simultaneously. However, if such quiet and scientific movements encounter accurate cannon fire from the enemy hitting one's own ship, the entire ship will fall into an indescribable state of chaos in an instant.

Such a great double task takes, at most, half an hour. Finally, the American fleet breaks through the enemy's vanguard, first sinking the first ship, followed by several warships in the center. Many of the remaining enemy ships either fled or were unable to move after being hit, and lowered their flags in surrender. The naval battle thus came to an end.

Cleaning up the aftermath on the sea surface - after the roar of the cannons subsided, a peaceful scene appeared on the sea surface. The remnants of the enemy warships gradually disappeared on the horizon, undoubtedly struggling there after being damaged. Although the American naval fleet won, it also suffered considerable damage. Even if the warships were still floating on the water and had not sunk, some of the ships were severely damaged. Ten or so cruisers and twenty or so destroyers were either sunk or rendered useless. Wreckage and broken hulls were floating everywhere on the water.

Shortly after, several undamaged destroyers sped over and rescued the drowning and wounded officers and soldiers from many small boats and sinking ships, and transferred them to heavy cruisers, battleships, and aircraft carriers. Doctors and priests were already waiting in the operating rooms to treat their wounds. Those with very serious injuries were sent to hospital ships stationed at naval bases for treatment. Even the seriously wounded enemy prisoners were given the same emergency treatment.

It is very difficult to immediately calculate the ships and personnel lost on both sides in a naval battle like the one described above. There are only a few large-scale naval battles in modern history. Each time a battle is fought, the number of warships damaged and the number of officers and soldiers killed on both sides is quite considerable. During the last World War, in the Battle of Jutland, the British lost three battleships, three cruisers, and eight destroyers. The German side lost one battleship, one battlecruiser, four light cruisers, and five destroyers. A total of eight thousand six hundred and forty-two officers and soldiers lost their lives on both sides. However, even today, historians call this naval battle "not a decisive battle."

Even in practice battles, sailors are truly injured. Some people are burned in the gun turrets, and some aviation pilots are injured when landing on the surface of the sea in the midst of huge waves. The wooden hulls of warships can sometimes be damaged as well. When large ships bombard, the shock is very severe, causing light bulbs to explode and even thick water pipes to burst open. Soldiers are specially stationed on the ships to repair them.

### Foreign Ratepayers' Special Meeting Passes, Establishes Provisional Board of Directors, Holds Annual Meeting to Approve the Collection of Taxes and Fees, Two Meetings Last Only 45 Minutes

The Special Meeting of Ratepayers and the Annual General Meeting, convened by Consul General Leader Hill, were held one after another at the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Security was tight inside and outside the venue. McDonald, who failed to be elected as a board member last year, attempted to prevent the convening of the special meeting on the grounds of illegal procedures and insufficient quorum, but was unsuccessful as no one seconded the motion. The meeting proceeded smoothly according to the agenda, and adjourned in just 45 minutes at 3:15 PM. The important matters passed included the Special Meeting's resolution to authorize the current Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council to request representatives of the countries involved to agree to establish a Provisional Board of Directors to continue handling the administration of the Settlement. It is noteworthy that only the change of Chinese directors to four was reported, and the nominees were not announced. The Annual General Meeting resolved to authorize the Shanghai Municipal Council to collect/supplement various proposed taxes and fees, and to raise temporary funds of one million yuan.

The number of ratepayers from various countries attending yesterday was less than at previous meetings held this year, with only over one thousand people present. This was likely because important resolutions had already been agreed upon behind the scenes by the authorities of various countries, so many people abstained from attending. Government officials present included U.S. Assessor's Office Judge Hermick, Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman Cornaby, Secretary-General Phillips, Financial Officer Mo Chao, American Director Myers, Allemann, Japanese Director Okamoto Ikusaku, Hao Yuta Kuo, and others.

### Special General Meeting

Opposition to the Meeting Prevents Formation: At 2:30 PM, Chairman Keswick announced the start of the meeting. First, a special general meeting was held, electing Judge Helm as chairman and Betts as secretary. This was unanimously approved. When Chairman Keswick finished speaking, McDonald, a British lawyer who unsuccessfully ran for the Board of Directors last year, took the stage and made startling remarks: "This meeting may as well be dismissed, and you can all return home. Attendees must be true human beings. Many present are dubious individuals and do not constitute a quorum." Judge Helm dismissed his comments as untrue. McDonald continued, "The term of the Provisional Board of Directors must be no less than one year, trending towards more than one year. This is a most serious problem. Although I may be forced to stop speaking, I am compelled to speak. This Provisional Board is a cursed resolution that I can never support. If you vote in favor, your death is near!" The crowd laughed uncontrollably, but no one applauded in agreement. Keswick's speech had been published in the newspapers beforehand and was not repeated, saving considerable time. Issues that had caused fierce debates in previous years were not even mentioned at this meeting. When item five of the agenda, the 1941 budget, was passed, the Municipal Council's music team's life was extended for two months.

Amendment to Land Regulations Passed

The chairman then announced that item three, the Yamakawa proposal, would be discussed. Keswick, the proposer, read the original proposal: "Please pass the amendment to the 'Appendices' of the Land Regulations and new appendices published in the Municipal Council Gazette on March 31st. The order of the clauses should follow the Gazette's arrangement, but delete 'Clause 4' of the new Appendix 52. Also, change the wording of 'Clause 3' of the same article to 'If the decision of the Municipal Council or the Appeals Committee becomes final and legally effective, the Municipal Council may implement this decision and collect taxes in accordance with Articles 10 and 20 of the Land Regulations.'" The chairman called for a vote, first asking those in favor to raise their hands, which a majority did. Then, he asked those against to raise their hands, but no one did. The chairman announced that the proposal was passed.

Resolution to Change the Administrative Structure

Next, item four was discussed, proposed by Keswick and seconded by Okamoto. They both stood up and read the proposal in English and Japanese: "(1) Authorize the current Board of Directors to request the representatives of the relevant countries to agree to establish a Provisional Board of Directors to continue administering the Public Settlement. Once the Provisional Board is established, the current Board should resign immediately. The candidates for the Provisional Board should be A.H. George, Carlile, Cholerton, Hanawa Yutaro, Liddell, MacDonald, Dr. Minsde, Mitchell, Powell, Crone, Yajima Yasuzo, Okamoto Ikkaku, along with four Chinese directors. (2) Within its term, the Provisional Board should suggest to the residents of the Public Settlement and the representatives of the relevant countries to consider a municipal system more satisfactory than that stipulated by the current Land Regulations." The original proposal was published in the Mokubo on April 10th. The chairman called for a vote, and the majority raised their hands in favor, so the proposal was passed.

Chairman's Speech Expressing Opinions

When item four of the agenda was proposed for discussion, Keswick, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, stood up and said: "As the Chairman of the Municipal Council, I propose item four for the General Meeting to discuss. This proposal is seconded by my colleague Mr. Okamoto and is of great importance to the public. I would like to ask you to seek the agreement of the representatives of the relevant countries to establish a Provisional Board of Directors of sixteen members to continue administering the Public Settlement, and to approve the proposed list of sixteen directors. If this proposal is passed, it can be said that a step has been taken to expand the number of directors. The solution to the problems we face depends on the cooperation of all responsible individuals in the Public Settlement, regardless of their nationality. According to Section (D) of the first section of the proposal, the Provisional Board of Directors should be granted all the powers of the Municipal Council and the foreign taxpayer community. I believe that most of you present will agree that the time has come to adopt another institution to replace the foreign taxpayer meeting. The procedure based on a small market town meeting is no longer applicable to one of the largest cities in the world. The proposal also stipulates that within its term, the Provisional Board of Directors should suggest considering a more satisfactory municipal system. The tax system is of great importance to you, and I would like to emphasize that there is a widespread perception among the public that the scope of the Bureau's tax collection should be expanded. A committee of the Bureau is continuing to meet and review the new tax system. Until the committee prepares to submit a report, it is impossible to specify which specific new tax system should be adopted. I suggest that, as in Section (F) of the first section of this proposal, the Provisional Board of Directors be granted broad and general taxation powers. In this regard, I dare to state that the original proposal clearly stipulates that this power must be exercised after consulting with an advisory committee selected from the residents of the Public Settlement. I believe that once a satisfactory new advisory body is discovered, you will have more genuine opportunities to express your opinions on the tax system than you do now. I now ask you to warmly support this proposal, and I am confident that your action will usher in a new era of international cooperation in the Public Settlement."

Okamoto's Speech Urging Assistance

Okamoto Ikkaku then gave a brief speech as the seconder: "I am honored to second the previous proposal. As a director of the Municipal Council, I have learned over the past year that the solution to some of the city's problems depends on the goodwill and cooperation of all resident groups in the Public Settlement. If you pass this proposal, it can be said that you have taken a major step towards promoting cooperation. You should note that the proposal does not ignore the issue of creating a more satisfactory municipal body. The Provisional Board of Directors will face many difficulties in the coming year and will need the loyalty and assistance of all responsible citizens of the Public Settlement to cope with them. I now ask you to pass this proposal and encourage us by showing your faith in us."

### Annual General Meeting

Election of Real Estate Committee for Next Year

After the special general meeting ended, the annual general meeting continued, with Helm as chairman and Betts as secretary. (1) Discussion of item three: The rules of procedure that were valid at the last annual meeting are still used in this meeting and remain valid until the next meeting. Resolved and passed. (2) Discussion of item four: Election of Mr. Ashbeak as a member of the Real Estate Committee for the coming year. Passed. (3) Discussion of item five: Election of Dr. Halli, Dr. Dunn, Dr. Borst, and Dr. Minsde as directors of the Public Hospital for the coming year. Resolved and passed.

Approval of Budget and its Recommendations

(4) Discussion of item seven: Please pass the 1941 budget of the Municipal Council, along with the attached recommendations, and authorize the Bureau to collect or supplement all proposed taxes and fees. If it is deemed appropriate, please approve the Bureau to raise a total of no more than 9 million yuan, or its equivalent, in a manner and on terms it deems appropriate, to cover the various uses specified in the temporary budget. Resolved and passed.

Passing the Tax System Committee Report

(5) Discussion of item eight: Please pass the report of the Committee on Studying Tax System Inequality (a document agreed to by a majority of the committee members). However, the implementation of Recommendations 2 and 3 in the report should be left to the new Board of Directors for consideration. Resolved and passed. (6) Discussion of item six: Please pass the 1940 Municipal Council Report and Accounts. Resolved and passed. Since Chairman Keswick had already issued a written report on the Municipal Council's past administration the night before, he did not stand up to explain when items six and seven were proposed for discussion, and no taxpayer present gave a speech. Therefore, the meeting proceeded smoothly and adjourned at 3:15 PM.

### The Shanghai Branches of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks Suspended Business Yesterday, Maintaining the Entire Financial System, Speculative Market Fluctuations Can Be Suppressed

The Central, China, Communications, and Chinese Farmers Banks, their Shanghai branches, and their affiliated branch offices all announced a temporary suspension of business yesterday morning due to the security of employees. However, they allowed for the continued maintenance of Shanghai's financial system, so the entire financial system remained stable. Rumors arose in the speculative market, causing slight fluctuations, but these were unrelated to the overall situation and are expected to be quelled.

The Four Banks Temporarily Suspended Operations Yesterday

(1) The Central Bank's Albert Road Shanghai Branch and Baker Road Office; (2) The China Bank's Avenue Joffre Shanghai Branch and Tongfu Road Intersection, Eight Immortals Bridge, Xinzha Road, Jing'an Temple, and Nanshi Boundary Road Hongkou Offices, and wartime retreat offices in Shanghai; (3) The Bank of Communications Avenue Joffre Shanghai Branch, Jing'an Temple, Min'guo Road, Nanjing Road three branches, and retreat offices in the Zhen District, Zhe District, and Hu District; (4) The Chinese Farmers Bank Avenue Joffre Shanghai Branch and Avenue Albert Road Office all announced a temporary suspension of business yesterday. The iron gates of each bank were tightly closed, and a notice was posted saying "Closed for business today."

Temporary Nature, Instructions Requested from Head Office

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai branches of the Four Banks that the decision to suspend business was temporary. Since the shooting of a China Bank employee at the China Bank villa, the employees of the Four Banks temporarily did not go to work due to security concerns. As a result, each bank was unable to open for business yesterday. It is said that after consulting with each other, the Shanghai branches of the Four Banks wired their head offices yesterday requesting instructions on how to proceed. Until clear instructions are received, they have decided to temporarily suspend business. All bills and receipts will be processed on the day of resumption. The Central Bank's Shanghai branch temporarily suspended its official exchange rate and equalization tax quotations yesterday.

Market Funds Still Very Ample

Regarding the maintenance of the entire Shanghai financial system by the Four Banks, Shanghai is the only major port in the Far East, the center of national and foreign trade, and the hub of Chinese finance. To take into account the legitimate trade of Chinese and foreign merchants and the interests of the city's residents, this has been maintained. Therefore, although the Four Banks have temporarily suspended business, the entire financial system remains stable. (1) The black market foreign exchange is being maintained through the joint cooperation of the Exchange Equalization Fund and various allied banks, and legitimate needs of various industries are being supplied as much as possible. (2) The finances of various industries are being adjusted by various banks to maintain their long-term stability. There is no tension in the market's money supply.

Speculative Black Market Slightly Fluctuates

Shanghai's various speculative markets, such as the black markets for gold, foreign stocks, Chinese securities, and cotton yarn, have been manipulated by speculators. Since the news of the Four Banks' temporary suspension of business was released, speculators have taken the opportunity to monopolize, causing slight fluctuations in the speculative market yesterday. The black market for foreign exchange slightly contracted, and the black market for gold rose sharply. However, this situation is unrelated to the overall financial system and is an unavoidable fact in Shanghai, where there is an abundance of floating capital. The value of various commodities has also changed accordingly, but this situation will soon be quelled.

Resumption of Business in the Near Future

United Press Chongqing, 17th: A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance told United Press today that the Shanghai branches of all government banks will continue to operate regardless of the circumstances. The spokesman also said that the Ministry of Finance had not yet received official news of the Shanghai branches of the Four Banks' suspension of business today. The National Government has repeatedly decided to maintain the Shanghai branches of all government banks until now. The spokesman also said that the Shanghai branches of government banks are open to the public of Shanghai. Meanwhile, banking circles pointed out that the Shanghai branches' temporary suspension of business due to the urgent situation should not be considered a permanent closure. Well-informed banking circles claim that the head offices of the Four Banks in this area are eager to do their best to maintain the Shanghai branches.

### New Commander of US Navy in Shanghai to Take Office Next Month, Colonel Baker Inspected the Fourth Regiment Yesterday Morning

Colonel Baker, commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, has been ordered to report for duty at the Navy Department in Washington. The US Navy authorities have announced that Colonel Howard has been selected as the new commander. According to well-informed sources, Colonel Howard is expected to arrive in China on the President Cleveland in early May to take office after making some arrangements in the United States. Colonel Baker will leave after the new commander arrives. Colonel Baker succeeded Colonel Fegan as commander here and has been in office for over a year, earning the love of the American community here. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Colonel Baker held an inspection of soldiers of the Fourth Regiment at the Racecourse Association baseball field, and the team dispersed at 10:20 AM. Colonel Baker presented medals to US Navy personnel with excellent shooting performance yesterday.

### Japanese Military Police, Together with Chinese, Attempt to Take Over the Taxpayers' Association but are Prevented, The Police Department Sends Detectives to Guard the Association, Lengthy Talks Between the Two Sides Yield No Results

The English-language Ta Mei Evening News reported that at 10:45 AM this morning (the 17th), a team of Japanese military police led by Major Du, together with plainclothes Chinese, attempted to take over the Shanghai Chinese Taxpayers' Association located in the Bank Association Building on Hong Kong Road, but were prevented by the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) and were unsuccessful.

Having Received Prior Notice, Detectives Were Sent to Guard

The Police Department, anticipating this Japanese attempt, sent two Western detectives and three Chinese detectives from the Central Police Station to guard the Chinese Taxpayers' Association. Just minutes later, three Japanese military police and several Chinese also arrived at the location, intending to break into and occupy the association, but were refused by the police officers.

The Two Sides Were Deadlocked, Permission to Enter Was Not Granted

Upon receiving a report, the Central Police Station immediately dispatched patrol officers Bowtie and Moore, leading a team, to rush to reinforce. At this time, another fifteen Japanese military police and Chinese, many carrying firearms, arrived in three cars, arriving at the scene before the patrol police. The Central Police, upon hearing the news, also sent Deputy Commissioner of Police Pannat to the scene to explain to the Japanese military police that since the police officers had arrived at the scene first, they had priority. The two sides were deadlocked, and Pannat immediately telephoned the Assistant Commissioner of Police Robertson for instructions on whether to hand over the association, but permission was not granted. He then informed the Japanese military police and continued the conversation.

Lengthy Talks, Both Sides Left

After more than half an hour, Major Hayashi said that he mistakenly believed that taking over the association would not encounter opposition. Hayashi then asked if he obtained the keys to the association and returned, would he be allowed to take over? However, Pannat ordered two Western detectives and several Chinese police officers to remain and guard the association. Even if the Japanese military police returned with the keys, they would not be allowed to occupy the association unless accompanied by personnel from the Political Section. The Japanese military police and Chinese and the police representatives talked for one hour and fifteen minutes but were still unsuccessful and left.

### An Ewo Worker Arrested and Interrogated

The wharf workers of the Ewo Cotton Mill at 1056 Yangshupu Road went on strike demanding improved treatment. At 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, a large number of workers clashed and fought with police officers, and many police officers and workers were injured. These events have been recorded in this newspaper. It has been learned that as a result of the fighting, Davis, a Western employee of the factory, was also injured. The workers who were arrested on the spot by the police were Kong Heshou, Hu Atu, Zhang Shikang, Wang Chunyou, Hu Huide, Hu Deyou, Yan Guolin, Wang Xiangli, Yan Futian, Chen Caiji, Cheng Yanguan, Zhang Yizhen, Lou Ar Er, Cai Qinghuo, Cai Qinglong, Wang Shaoyun, Yan Shaodi, Yan Haiqing, Li Huajun, Lu Caiyuan, Yan Cunxin, Dong Baoyou, Hu Chunhuo, Zhang Peiduo, Wang Liangzhong, Cen Afu, Zhang Yingtai, Wang Liangzao, Jiang Zaoming, Yu Wenquan, Sun Deguang, and thirty-one others. The first sixteen of them were more seriously injured. This morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan requested a postponement of the interrogation because the first sixteen defendants were unable to attend court due to injuries in the hospital. After questioning by Judge Liu Yugui, the judge ordered them to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.

### Telegram Urging the CCP to Send Representatives to the Soviet Union, Reaffirming Guarantees of Aid to China, Student Federation Sends Telegram to the Highest CCP Officials

The Shanghai Student Federation telegraphed the highest CCP officials, Yan'an. Addressed to the esteemed CCP's highest officials, we are shocked by the Soviet-Japanese diplomatic representatives' signing of the Neutrality Pact in Moscow, declaring the so-called "People's Republic of Outer Mongolia" and the "Empire of Manchuria" to have territorial integrity and inviolability, and guaranteeing each other's security. This agreement, which harms our country's territory and administration, cannot be recognized by our people. It is inconsistent with the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Agreement of 1924 and the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of 1937. Today, the Soviet Union seeks compromise with Japan, even at the expense of Sino-Soviet friendship. The news is astonishing. The Soviet Union, as the initiator of the international anti-aggression front and championing sympathy for the revolutionary movements of small and weak nations, has now disregarded trust and faith, colluding with the aggressor and openly insulting our country's sovereignty. Its intentions are incomprehensible. Regardless of the Soviet government's motives, whether to divide the Axis or drive Japan south, the result will inevitably be broken promises and self-serving opportunism. The CCP's daily activities in the country are obedient to the Soviet Union, and all propaganda is based on the Soviet line. The CCP's service to the Soviet Union has not been ineffective. But CCP members are all citizens of the Republic of China, and it is believed that this event is also the greatest regret. We have always admired your spirit of opposing "compromise" and "surrender" and have always been at the forefront. We dare to telegraph you to convene an emergency meeting immediately, send representatives to Moscow, and make sincere requests to ensure careful consideration of your actions and reaffirm concrete guarantees of aid to us. Know that making any agreement with a country that has no faith will inevitably lead to betrayal and self-destruction. We eagerly await your response. The Shanghai Student Federation bows.

### Report on Administrative Overview by Keswick, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council (2), Speech at the Foreign Taxpayers' Meeting Yesterday

Various Committees Contribute Significantly

The work of the Special Economic Committee has been repeatedly published. The committee was established based on the resolution of the last annual meeting and has held no fewer than eighty meetings throughout the year.

### Rice Market Yesterday Received Instruction to Implement Standard Rice Prices, Based on the Previous Day's Closing Prices as the Standard, Which is a Temporary Measure to Restrict Rice Prices

Within the past three to five days, the average price of rice per dan (unit of weight) has been inflated by about ten yuan. The Public Concession's Municipal Council, therefore, specifically instructed the Rice Market Management Committee to stipulate standard selling prices for domestic and foreign rice, in order to stabilize the market situation. Upon receiving the instruction, the market issued Public Notice No. 188 yesterday morning. The original text is copied as follows: "We have just received an instruction from the Municipal Council that the market price of rice managed by this market should be based on the closing price of yesterday (the 16th) as the standard. From today onwards, anyone who exceeds this standard without authorization will be severely punished without leniency. This is a special announcement for all to know and strictly abide by. This notice."

Rice Price Standards

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Rice Market Management Committee that the closing prices for domestic and foreign rice on the market on the 16th were as follows: (1) Domestic Rice: White粳 128.5 yuan, Early and Late Rice 118.5 yuan, Liyang White 122 yuan, Wuhu Sharp 116 yuan; (2) Foreign Rice: Saigon No. 1 124 yuan, Saigon No. 2 120 yuan, Siamese No. 1 123 yuan, Mindang 123 yuan, Fire Twisted 122 yuan, Small Pattern 120 yuan (Yinghua Company 146 yuan), 礱 Rice 115 yuan, Hong Kong Glutinous Rice 114 yuan, Saigon Broken Rice 99 yuan (Yinghua Company 117 yuan). The above prices are calculated based on 160 market catties (equal to one dan).

Secret Investigation by Detectives

The authorities of both concessions have each dispatched several detectives daily to the rice market to monitor rice merchants' transactions. They have apprehended speculative rice merchants several times and dealt with them according to the law. Previously, the Rice Price Evaluation Committee voluntarily disbanded, which led to the de facto cancellation of the price limits on fifteen types of foreign rice, making secret investigation work impossible to carry out. Now that the authorities have instructed the setting of price limits for domestic and foreign rice, in addition to resuming secret investigation work, and in order to expand operations, the Central Detective Office of the Public Concession has specifically assigned several detectives under Mao Guobao to be stationed at important locations in the rice market to investigate the operations of rice merchants. Once discovered, they will be arrested and severely punished without leniency.

Hoarding and Firmly Stockpiling

After the rice market opened yesterday morning, the authorities had taken measures to set price limits for domestic and foreign rice, and those holding goods found it inconvenient to raise rice prices. Therefore, the price of domestic and foreign rice was relatively stable yesterday morning, and transactions were made according to the limits. However, in general, large holders of goods, although not raising market prices, are firmly stockpiling and unwilling to easily release their holdings, waiting for favorable prices to sell, which has a significant impact on the rice market. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.

Afternoon Black Market

The afternoon rice trade has a considerable impact on the rice market. Because it is impossible to raise the price of rice sold in the morning, and there is fear of being discovered and prosecuted by detectives stationed in the market, rice is sold secretly in the afternoon at the Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Exchange at No. 15 Avenue Edward VII, reaping illegal profits. According to sources, the concession authorities, considering that the afternoon rice trade is seriously detrimental to the overall food supply of Shanghai, are actively seeking ways to ban the afternoon rice trade, so as to standardize the transaction prices of domestic and foreign rice.

Price Limits on Miscellaneous Grains

After the rice price is limited, the commission charged by the rice industry should not exceed five jiao per shi (unit of capacity). The retail price of rice shops should not exceed one yuan and five jiao per shi. The selling prices of miscellaneous grains are also limited to the closing prices of the 16th as the standard: (1) Flower-Bird Flour, 30 yuan and 5 jiao and a half per bag; (2) Wheat, 45 yuan per dan; (3) Dutch Corn, 33 yuan and 6 jiao. It is also learned that the Miscellaneous Grains Association has notified all members to hold a meeting at the association's location at 3:00 PM today to discuss market operating methods.

### Western Employee of the Health Department Robbed of His Car

At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a car with license plate number Black 4730, driven by a Westerner, was blocked on a road in the western district of Shanghai by five bandits who used weapons to threaten the Westerner to get out of the car. The five bandits jumped in and drove away quickly, whereabouts unknown. It was later learned that the car belonged to Baker, a Western employee of the Health Department of the Public Concession's Municipal Council.

### Wang Shouyi and His Wife Arrested Yesterday

At 7:30 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese side suddenly dispatched four plainclothes personnel to the French Concession, along with detectives from the French police, to the house at No. 389 Route Frelupt, where they arrested the resident, Wang Shouyi (46 years old), a local, and his wife, Mrs. Ma. They were taken to the French police station. Since the Japanese side did not provide evidence of their crimes, the police station temporarily detained them for investigation. However, it is said that Wang and his wife were arrested because the Japanese side suspected them of being involved in intelligence work. It is also said that Wang is the owner of a certain nail factory.

### Exhibition of Recent Oil Paintings by Qian Ding

Qian Ding (Zhu Jiu), a famous oil painter and longtime professor, recently opened a painting studio at No. 3, Lane 106, Route Ghisi, after three years of continuous study and accumulation of many exquisite works. To provide an opportunity for art lovers in Shanghai to appreciate his work, he has specially scheduled an exhibition of all his works in the studio from the 18th to the 22nd of this month, divided into three rooms for landscapes, portraits, and still lifes. The exhibition hours are from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily.

### Assault Incident at the Residence of Criminal Court President Feng Shide; Patrol Officers Stationed There Discovered and Took Precautions; Two Bombs Were Thrown, One Chinese Constable Slightly Injured

Around 12:00 AM on the 13th of this month, a number of thugs broke into No. 48, Lane 445, Route Metrahest, attempting to kidnap Xiang Zhejiong, the chief prosecutor of the Shanghai First Special District Court, without success, but they robbed two Chinese constables of two rows of bullets from their pistols. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. However, at around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, another bombing attack occurred in front of the residence of Feng Shide, the Criminal Court President of the Special First Court on Route Annam. The detectives stationed by the police department at that time engaged in a fight with the thugs, resulting in one Chinese constable being injured. The details are as follows:

Guards Stationed at the Judge's Residence

Feng Shide, courtesy name Mingjiu, from Xuzhou, is the current Criminal Court President of the First Special District Court. His Shanghai residence is at No. 30, Cihou North Lane, Route Annam. Previously, due to repeated attacks on court personnel, the Public Concession Police Department, in order to protect the safety of all judges, assigned detectives to protect the residences of the judges. Feng's residence was also guarded by three Chinese constables from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, No. 303, No. 3139, and No. 1759, up to the present.

Car Arrives Quietly in the Deep Night

At around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, due to martial law, there were no people on the roads in the deep of night. Suddenly, a black private car with license plate number 2735 stopped abruptly at the entrance of Cihou Lane. Several men in Western suits jumped out of the car, but did not enter the lane. They were seen whispering to each other at the entrance of the lane by Constable No. 1062, the lane guard, who suspected them because they were neither residents of the lane nor did they look like they were visiting someone at night. He immediately reported to the Chinese constables guarding Feng's residence.

Two Bombs Thrown in the Face; Both Explode

Upon receiving the news, the three Chinese constables, along with the lane guard, formed a team and went out with their guns raised, intending to question them. Unexpectedly, the men had already entered the lane. When the Western-suited men saw the constables, they knew they had been exposed. The leader reached into his pocket and took out two hand grenades, throwing them directly at the constables. There was a loud bang, and shrapnel flew everywhere. However, the constables were far away and were not hit by the explosion. They opened fire, but the Western-suited thugs also fired back and fled out of the lane, jumping into the car and escaping without a trace.

Shrapnel Shatters Plaster, Injures Chinese Constable

After the police department was notified, it urgently dispatched a large team of Chinese and Western detectives to the scene in police cars and searched the surrounding area. It was found that the brick walls and cement in the lane were cracked by the explosion of the bombs, and the shrapnel had injured the face and cheeks of Chinese Constable No. 31129. The injured constable was taken to the hospital, but his injuries were not serious. After being bandaged, he left the hospital. It is also learned that the police authorities are paying close attention to the case and are conducting a strict investigation. It is said that the license plate number of the car may be fake, because it is known that car number 2735 is a small car, while the car used by the thugs was a large car. Therefore, it can be concluded that the car's license plate was forged.

### Landlord Accused of Harboring Criminal

The English-language "China Press" reported that Jack La Rue, a US citizen once known as the "King of Slot Machines," is now being returned to the United States for imprisonment. Before his arrest, La Rue, using the alias John Baker, was hiding in a house in Hongkou. The landlord, Mrs. Suxina (an unrecognized Brazilian national), is suspected of harboring a criminal. The First Court issued a summons today (the 17th), ordering her to appear in court tomorrow morning (the 18th) for trial. At that time, the Public Concession Police Department will formally prosecute her. If the woman fails to appear in court tomorrow morning, the First Court will issue an arrest warrant. According to the authorities, when the Police Department and US officials arrested Jack La Rue, the woman said that she little knew that Jack was hiding in her house, only that the arrested person was named "Frank."

### Zhu Changhai Shot at the Intersection of Avenue Haig and Chengdu Road; Bullet Entered His Shoulder and Back; Bullet Has Been Removed; Zhu is the Printing Director of the China Press

Zhu Changhai, 36 years old, is from northern Jiangsu Province and is currently the director of the printing department of the China Press. He usually lives in the newspaper office and rarely goes out. Unexpectedly, at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon, he went out on an errand when a man suddenly emerged from the roadside and fired a shot at his back. The bullet entered his back, and he fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. When the Chinese constables heard the sound and arrived, the assailant had already fled without a trace. They immediately reported to the police station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the scene for investigation. A rescue vehicle was summoned and the injured person was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. His injuries were serious. After doctors operated and removed the bullet, his condition did not improve. It is said that his life may be in danger. It is reported that at around 10:00 PM last night, his family transferred Zhu Changhai to another hospital for treatment.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Tianjin and the surrounding areas of Shandong are sunny with a lot of sand and dust, with strong southwest to northwest winds. Here, it will change from sunny and warm to cloudy and foggy, with south to west winds. The area south of Ma'anshan Island is cloudy, with southeast winds. Rain is falling around Micronesia Island. Also, within the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 88.5 degrees, and the lowest was 57.0 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 70.2 degrees, and the lowest was 45.9 degrees.

### Food: Another New Price Limit; Let's See if Old Tricks and Corrupt Practices Will Occur

After the soaring prices of foreign rice in recent times, the concession authorities, considering that this situation is not a blessing for the people's food supply, are urgently seeking ways to curb it. Yesterday, the market announced the re-implementation of price limits based on the closing prices of the previous day. The price for Saigon No. 1 was set at 124 yuan, No. 2 at 120 yuan, Siamese No. 1, Mindang, and Fire Twisted at 123 yuan, Small Twisted at 120 yuan, Tokyo 礱 Sharp at 115 yuan, and Broken Sharp Pill at 109 yuan, causing both buyers and sellers to be cautious and not dare to manipulate prices at will. Transactions are being made according to the limits. However, the sales side is still not affected by the price limits. Not only are speculators continuing to collect, but also new hoarding retailers are unusually active, absorbing each other. Therefore, although the early market situation was once soft, the afternoon market recovered strongly, with only purchases and no sales, ultimately closing firmly. The prices are all in line with the limited range, which is difficult to change after hitting the wall. I believe it will continue to rise straight to the sky. However, especially high-quality goods have not been sampled. The transactions on the market are all high-quality goods in the general market. Although they were sold at the limited price yesterday, there is deep concern that they will soon be sold as high-quality goods. There is no market for Yinghua Company's Saigon, Small Pattern at 146 yuan, and Broken Rice at 117 yuan, with transactions of over a thousand tons. There are now less than 10,000 bags of rice because only local customers are handling them slightly. The general external large accounts have not yet dared to try immediately.

Although there is not much market stock of thick 粳 and glutinous rice, it was also restricted by the price limits yesterday, causing the goods owners to want to push up prices but were not allowed by the facts. At the same time, local shops and customer stockpiles took advantage of this to conduct business smoothly, and the sales side felt lonely. The selling prices all followed the specified limits, with Changbang Qing Special粳 opening at 128.5 yuan, High粳 at 126 yuan, Kunshan Special粳 at 125 yuan, and 秔至 at 120 yuan. Qingjiao 斛见 Thin Rice was at 118.3 yuan to 117 yuan, Hong Kong Special Yuan glutinous rice at 114 yuan, 秔至 at 110 yuan, and Glutinous 菉 at 104 yuan to 100 yuan.

### Flour Market Loosens Secretly

Due to the rapid increase in rice and oil prices, and the Municipal Council's crackdown on speculation and monopolies, the miscellaneous grain market has virtually stagnated. However, there are reportedly 1,000 bags of newly arrived Yellow Bull brand 坎 flour being distributed directly to customers outside the market at a price of 28 yuan and 9 jiao. They were all handled by mainland agents. However, under the authorities' crackdown on speculation, retail accounts are quite eager to sell 金龙 brand 坎 flour, and the price has secretly loosened from 28 yuan and 9 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao. Flower-Bird brand Australian flour, with only a small amount of inventory, still requires 30 yuan and 5 jiao. It is said that later batches of 坎 flour are arriving continuously, but sales by North and South customers have already stopped. Chinese factories are supplying plain-priced flour as usual. Therefore, the market prospect may be difficult to view optimistically for a while.

Wheat is truly idle. Amidst the strong demand in the flour market, goods owners are all holding on, so the market supply is extremely limited. There is also no spot goods available for collection at Japanese factory outlets.

### Price Limits Implemented for Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes

Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains and oil cakes market, due to the sudden indication from the authorities of the two concessions that all commodity prices must not exceed the prices opened on the 16th, the industry association announced to the market, advising its members to strictly abide by and implement the price limits. Therefore, there were only sporadic transactions in the market yesterday (10 pieces and 100 cans of live oil, 300 bags of soybeans, 3 vehicles of red grain, 200 bags and 50 tons of corn, and 6,3400 pieces of soybean cake were transacted), and market prices changed little. However, although the overall situation is suppressed, people's hearts are enthusiastic, and the flames of speculative desire are high, which may inevitably lead to compliance in name only and doing dark market transactions.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Fluctuations, Buying Spree Arises

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw a stable HSBC listing. Secret markets for sterling and US dollars were chaotic, first tightening and then slightly rebounding. An unfortunate incident involving a Bank of China employee led to the closure of the "Four Banks," leaving speculative traders without supply from banks, causing sterling to rise to 3 shillings and 1.875 pence and US dollars to 5.1875 yuan. After 9:15 AM, Chinese banks stepped in to stabilize, followed by British and American banks, bringing the tightening to a halt. US dollars could be settled at 5.25 yuan at one point, and sterling also rebounded slightly. However, the market stabilized by noon and was even more stable in the afternoon, with fewer transactions. Chinese and foreign businesses supplied US dollars at 5.21875 yuan, with 5.25 yuan as the buying price. At closing, sterling was at 3 shillings and 2.34375 pence, and US dollars were at 5.21875 yuan, with sterling up by 0.03125 and US dollars up by 0.0625.

Speculators rose to the occasion in the chaotic opening and bought up. Amidst unfavorable rumors, banks reduced their supply, causing a sudden tightening. Chinese merchants sold May US dollars at 5.21875 yuan and 1.875 yuan, and sterling also softened to 3 shillings and 1.875 pence at 9:15 AM. After a rumor that the Bank of China would open as usual, the speculative rush subsided, and the market hardened. Chinese banks supplied more readily, and foreign banks traded April 5.25 with Chinese banks. HSBC's listing was unchanged. After the silver equalization tax remained at 24.50%, HSBC and Citibank sold April 5.21875 to Chinese banks and speculators, and Chinese merchants also sold May 5.25 to foreign banks. The market softened again at noon, with noon closings at sterling 3 shillings and 2.03125 pence and US dollars 5.21875 yuan.

Slightly More Stable in the Afternoon

### Gold Market Short Squeeze, New High Price of 6,702 Yuan

Yesterday, the gold market's 烚赤 black market saw a frenzied short squeeze due to the temporary closure of the "Four Banks" in the city and the sudden tightening of foreign exchange. Market prices jumped and rose sharply, opening at a high price of 6,700 yuan, with a highest price of 6,701 yuan. This triggered profit-taking from long positions, and after hearing that foreign exchange was being maintained by Chinese, British, and American banks, three gold shops and two foreign exchange shops began to sell, leading to a 100 yuan pullback, falling to 6,605 yuan at one point. Near noon, securities firms bought in again, causing prices to rise again. The upward trend continued in the early afternoon, but as foreign exchange stabilized and approached the settlement price, gold and silver shops began to sell, pushing the price back to around 6,640 yuan, eventually rising by 93 yuan. Total daily trading volume was 50,000 taels, with the four-month rollover to May seeing sellers paying buyers 28 yuan. Cash transactions were sparse, with Chi Da selling 70 taels to Cheng Da and Yong Cheng selling 50 taels to a certain silver shop, both 150 yuan higher than the forward price. In the afternoon, Tong Kang Yong sold 20 taels to Yi Feng, 140 yuan higher, with the price 50 yuan higher than the previous day. Jewelry gold once reached 705 yuan, finally closing at 700 yuan, up 5 yuan.

狂烚赤 Surges Nearly 100 Yuan

From the morning, due to unfavorable news and tight foreign exchange, market sentiment was uniformly upward, and prices unexpectedly jumped. The market opened at 9:15 AM, rising to the 6,700 yuan level, 156 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. In the chaos, 成记, 祥和, 德大 gold shops and 大丰, 新丰永来 foreign exchange shops sold, 恒记 also sold, and as foreign exchange softened slightly, the price fluctuated only 20 yuan, with the small board down 98 yuan to a low of 6,605 yuan. At noon, 诚达 一大 大丰 德孚 bought in, and the price rose to 6,645 yuan. The noon closing was called at 6,613 yuan. After the market closed, 义元 益大 actively bought, rising to 6,665 yuan. At 2:00 PM, the market opened at 6,660 yuan, 17 yuan higher than the noon closing price, and then rose to 6,670 yuan as 德孚 bought in again. 成记 gold shop actively sold, and as foreign exchange was not tight and was approaching the settlement price, retail accounts also sold, causing the market to fall to 6,635 yuan. Then 德孚 and other securities firms actively bought, rising to 6,750 yuan. 恒记 成记 retail accounts sold, eventually pressing the price down to 6,630 yuan. The market closed at 4:00 PM at 6,637 yuan, a sharp increase of 93 yuan compared to the noon closing price of the previous day, equivalent to 6,673 yuan based on the May US dollar settlement price of 5.21875 yuan, a difference of 36 yuan. The entire day saw a fluctuation of 97 yuan.

US Dollar Notes Once Hit 19 Yuan

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw a sharp rise in the 烚赤 market price, and British and American gold pounds also rose by 2 yuan. British gold notes remained fixed, and the market price remained stable. The US dollar notes rose and then pulled back slightly, once breaking through the 19 yuan mark, rising to 19 yuan and 5 cents at one point. However, as many people took advantage of the high price to sell, the market price immediately fell back, ultimately closing at 18 yuan and 7 jiao and 4 fen, still up 2 jiao and 9 fen compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes finally rose by 1 fen, Japanese gold notes rose again above the 2 yuan mark, rising to 2 yuan and 1 fen in the evening market, and Korean notes also tended to rise, reaching 1 yuan and 7 jiao and 2 fen in the evening market.

### Securities: Bonds Affected by the Situation

The bond black market yesterday was trending fluctuating and uncertain when an unexpected incident occurred in this city, causing the "Four Banks" to be unable to respond to the market as usual. Rumors spread for a while, mostly speculative and unfounded, causing unease in people's hearts. Selling pressure was stronger in the market, and major longs temporarily withdrew. Therefore, transactions were also sluggish. The environment was subject to unexpected events that were difficult to predict, causing the bond market to be unable to rise temporarily. In the morning market, the United Union had sell orders, and Class C bonds were down 2 jiao. Although Tong Kang and Xie Kang bought in, the selling pressure was strong. Class C bonds opened at 5 yuan and 5 jiao, falling to 5 yuan and 1 jiao at one point. Later, the price slowly rose to 5 jiao due to retail accounts covering short positions. Although the market situation was weak, it was still stable. In the afternoon, United Interests had more sell orders, and there were also scattered retail sell orders. The market price weakened again and fell back uniformly, resulting in a pullback of 4 jiao to 7 jiao. The total volume of transactions was only about 1 million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.

For stock trading, 300 shares of the Cotton Yarn Exchange were transacted, with the price at 50 yuan and 5 jiao.

Public industrial stocks were quiet and sluggish, with very narrow fluctuations, generally trending softer. Rubber stocks saw even fewer transactions.

The British China International Trust Investment Co., Ltd. and Yangzi Silver Co. will both hold their annual shareholders' meetings on May 12. For the year ending March 1941, the unresolved dividend for International Trust is 3 yuan and 2 jiao and a half per share, plus the interim dividend of 1 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, for a total annual dividend of 5 yuan. Yangzi's unresolved dividend is 2 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, plus the interim dividend of 1 yuan, for a total annual dividend of 3 yuan and 2 jiao and a half.

London, 16th (Wednesday) Telegraph: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British company stocks saw only a decline of 5 shillings for Mercantile Bank shares, with the price at 8 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence. There were no other changes.

### Cotton Yarn: Active Speculation, Soaring Yarn Prices

The cotton yarn market, which was stable the previous day, rose again yesterday. This was due to positive sentiment, uniformly upward expectations, high prices for all goods, rising raw material prices, and numerous rumors, all of which were beneficial to long positions. The standard gold price rose sharply, which led to a surge in speculative buying. As for actual sales, demand from Hong Kong dealers remained strong, and cloth consumption was robust with high selling prices exceeding yarn prices, thus buyers became more active. Under this competitive buying, Shuangma (Double Horse) yarn prices naturally soared, breaking through the 500 yuan mark. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,533 yuan, and the low price was 1,507 yuan. In the early afternoon, it traded at 1,528 yuan, rising to 537 yuan. Subsequently, as long positions were closed, it pulled back slightly to 1,521 yuan and then rose again to 1,527 yuan. The final price was 1,520 yuan, but at 5:30 PM, someone wanted to buy at 1,524 yuan.

Shuangma opened in the morning, continuing the strong rising momentum from the afternoon of the previous day. The opening price was 1,500 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers flocked in, and the market was filled with buying voices, immediately rising to 1,527 yuan. It was then heard that the standard gold price had soared, and buying became even more active, reaching 1,533 yuan again. Subsequently, as profitable players and large accounts sold together, supply eased slightly, and the market sentiment weakened, pulling back to 1,507 yuan. However, securities firms and small companies were uniformly optimistic, and buyers were very strong, rising again to 1,520 yuan. The price remained stable at this level for a long time. By the time of closing, it was heard that gold prices were high, and the price rose again to 1,529 yuan. The closing price pulled back slightly to 1,524 yuan. Statistics for transactions in the half-day totalled 8,500 bales. The amount purchased by each dealer is listed on the left: Hong Kong 1,000, Đồng Hành 7,000. Total: 8,500.

### Cotton Mill Business Flourishing; Cotton Prices Rise Sharply

Spot cotton prices continue to rise, and the upward trend is intensifying. This is because the situation in the Pacific is becoming critical, allowing those holding goods to demand higher prices. At the same time, Chinese merchants are actively purchasing cotton for their mills, further bolstering confidence. As a result, 20-count raw cotton is increasing by more than ten yuan. The rise in raw cotton prices for 42-count fine yarn is even more pronounced. However, the supply of Indian cotton is abundant, and the favorable environment has not been affected in the slightest. Yesterday, a total of 8,421 bales were traded, with prices rising by 3.5 yuan. The opening prices for various spot cotton grades are recorded as follows:

Another report: Cotton trading in Shanghai remains lively and active. On the one hand, the spot yarn market is doing well, and people are optimistic about future prices. On the other hand, Shanghai's inventory is quite low, and there is concern that overseas procurement may be disrupted. Therefore, traders have been actively competing to buy Indian and Brazilian cotton, with each exceeding 1,000 bales. Furthermore, mills are naturally purchasing cotton continuously to replenish their raw cotton supply. Yesterday, Wing On Company purchased over a thousand bales of Indian cotton. Consequently, the market has risen sharply and entered a state of fierce competition.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to speculative selling but later rebounded due to short covering and strong support from Wall Street. As a result, the closing price rose or fell by one point per pound compared to the previous day.

There is no market report for Indian cotton. It is predicted that the opening price today will increase slightly by one rupee.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply in the Afternoon Market

Mill Cloth: Yesterday's market started flat but then rose as some traders took profits amid sluggish sales. As a result, the opening bids for various cloths in the morning fluctuated only slightly. However, in the afternoon, traders and garden owners resumed buying, causing market prices to surge. As a result, fine cloth and twill rose by 5 to 7.5 jiao per bolt, and coarse cloth rose by about 9 jiao per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth increased by 5 jiao in some cases. Over 500 pieces of coarse and fine cloth,府绸(fǔchóu), and bleached cloth were traded on this street. The Guangdong and Hong Kong traders dealt in over 300 pieces of blue cloth and colored twill. The Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Taizhou traders handled over 100 pieces of colored cloth, fine cloth, and coarse cloth. The Nanyang traders handled over one hundred pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to continuous strong buying by both internal and external traders for hoarding, prices of all goods rose uniformly. Among white goods, mid-range fine twill experienced a sharp increase of about one yuan per bolt due to strong customer demand. Fine cloth rose by 6-7 jiao. The closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head brand現棧單(xiànzhàndān) in the afternoon was 52.6 yuan. Colored cloth君子嗶嘰(jūnzǐ bìjī) continued to be sought after by hoarders, becoming increasingly scarce, and rose sharply to 1.5825 yuan.

### Coal: Kaiping Arrivals Scattered

Kaiping Coal: Due to scattered arrivals of Kaiping bituminous coal in recent days and restrictions on supplies from the production area, the sales offices in this city are only supplying a limited amount to old customers, and refusing new customers altogether. As a result, there is very little outflow from traders, and the market is controlled by hoarders. In the private market yesterday, Kaiping lump coal was priced at 370 yuan per ton, and No. 2 fines at 320 yuan. Traders delivered from their warehouses to customers, with an additional handling fee.

### Tong De Li Coal: Claimed to be Accumulated by Customers

Yesterday, this newspaper published a news item titled "Tong De Li Coal Hoarded and Not Sold." We have now received a letter from Bingxing Coal Company, the manager of the coal, explaining the situation and requesting a correction. We are attaching the original letter below:

To the Editor of Commercial News, Shen Bao:

We have just seen a news item in the "Coal" section of your newspaper today, titled "Tong De Li Coal Hoarded and Not Sold." Although the article did not explicitly name our company, we are the sole distributors of Tong De Li Coal, so we must respond. Our company has always sold Tong De Li Coal as soon as it arrives, and we have never hoarded it. It is not that we are unaware that hoarding can lead to profiteering, but in these extraordinary times, we recognize the need to sacrifice the individual for the greater good. This is what people on this island should do, so there's no need to ask others to understand. However, the public only knows that coal merchants can hoard coal, but they don't understand the difference between hoarders and coal merchants. Our company simply does not have enough coal to satisfy the unlimited demand from customers. Therefore, some people have taken advantage of this situation, spreading false rumors and accusations to vent their personal grievances. We admire your newspaper for upholding justice and maintaining social order. However, we believe that the publication of this news may please the accuser, but it makes the accused feel that there is no right or wrong in the world. Therefore, we respectfully request that you investigate the accuser's motives and determine whether the accusation is justified. We would be very grateful if you would grant us a correction. Respectfully, Bingxing Coal Company.

Editor's Note: Recently, coal prices have risen sharply, greatly impacting users, and even making it impossible to purchase. Those who are unaware of the situation may assume that coal businesses are hoarding and profiteering, disregarding the hardships of the public. Having read the letter, we now understand the underlying reasons. The statement "sacrifice the individual for the greater good" is commendable, and we deeply feel that there is no right or wrong in the world, and cannot help but sigh. However, the fact remains that a large quantity of coal has been absorbed by customers, and genuine users are still unable to receive the benefits. Although this cannot be entirely blamed on the company, it is inconsistent with the company's spirit of upholding the greater good. If the company could stop supplying customers and instead supply its coal to direct consumers as much as possible, while still limiting their purchase quantity, up to one ton or as little as a quarter of a ton, and register each purchase to understand the usage time, in order to prevent disguised purchases for hoarding, then the company's sincere effort to uphold the greater good would be clear to the world, and no one could slander it.

### Metals: Ribbed Steel Bars Remain Firm

Ribbed steel bars are still in demand by construction companies and retail buyers, so the market is not quiet. Traders' sentiment is also rising. Overseas supplies have been cut off, and Shanghai's inventory is not large. The future outlook remains positive. Although only 20-30 tons were traded yesterday, prices remain firm. 3-fen (three-tenths of an inch) ribbed steel bars are priced at 3,300 yuan per ton, and 5-fen to 1-inch bars are priced at around 3,200 yuan per ton.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Rise Even More Sharply

The sugar market fluctuated yesterday, but the overall trend was upward, with white sugar experiencing the most significant increase. The Public Association's listed spot price for Grade 24 coarse white sugar was 91.87 yuan, up 1.45 yuan. The futures price for the 20th of this month initially rose from 91 yuan to 91.5-92 yuan, but then fell slightly as retail investors took profits.

### The Women's Refresher School Strike Will Be Resolved; Mediation Has Been Going Smoothly in Recent Days; Classes May Resume Next Monday

Since the teachers of the Shanghai Women's Refresher School in this city raised six demands, which were rejected by the school, misunderstandings occurred, resulting in unfortunate events such as a strike. After repeated contacts between the two parties in recent days, they have gradually become closer. Yesterday, all the students of the school sent a letter to the school authorities, requesting early mediation to avoid wasting their studies. As for the mediation, the school entrusted Director Tian of the main school and Director Xu of the branch school to handle it. The teachers were represented by Dai Lizhi. After several contacts, the results were quite satisfactory. At 9 pm last night, the teachers sent additional representatives, including Ji Yan and others, to discuss with the school again. Except for the last item, the method of which has not been fully determined, the other five items have no problems. According to a reporter from the teachers' side, the various items raised will be submitted for discussion at a teachers' meeting tomorrow (the 18th) morning before a final decision can be made. Therefore, there is great confidence in a successful reconciliation, and classes are expected to resume next Monday.

### Yinghua Alumni Association Holds Public Banquet for Supervisor Gao Zhihui

Fuzhou Yinghua Alumni Association, Shanghai Branch, held a banquet for Gao Zhihui, the former principal of the school, who has been in China for 40 years and is now returning to the United States with his wife after completing his term. At the same time, Dr. Chen Wenyuan, chairman of the association, was promoted to supervisor.

### How to Study Chemistry (II)

— Wu Ruiping

3. Research on Chemistry

We already know the importance and necessity of chemistry research. However, people often hesitate because of its difficulty or stop halfway, resulting in a failure to achieve success. Now, based on my experience in chemistry research and chemistry teaching, I will briefly discuss the methods of research. When I teach, I often ask students which subject they are most interested in, and they always say, "Chemistry." When asked which subject they find the most difficult, they also say, "Chemistry." When asked why, they say that studying chemistry is like watching magic, so it is very interesting, but there are countless changes, making it difficult to remember, so it is the most difficult. Reading chemistry is like watching magic, its basic concept is already wrong, how can it not be difficult to read? You need to know that when watching magic, "eyes" in an instant hen turns into a duck, this is false, to understand, to learn only need to be familiar with the operation, reading chemistry to know that white sugar mixed with potassium chlorate plus concentrated sulfuric acid will catch fire, this is true to understand the true principle of what is not easy, because chemistry for the interpretation of natural phenomena and the description of scientific theory, are based on facts and strict organization, is definitely not comparable to learning magic, so the researcher of chemistry, must have the prerequisite conditions, what is the condition, please look carefully at it,

(1) Strong Interest Regardless of doing things or studying, to obtain satisfactory results, we must first be interested in this matter before we can, and the same is true for studying chemistry. How can we arouse interest in studying chemistry?

A. Read more general youths after reading ×× The Legend of the Chivalrous Man, they went to Mount Emei one after another to seek immortals and visit Taoists. On the one hand, they were motivated by their curiosity, and on the other hand, youths are rich in imitation. If this type of book is changed to the biography of famous chemists or the history of success of chemists, I predict that it will definitely arouse the interest of youths and achieve twice the result with half the effort.

B. Observe more. We should recognize that chemistry research must be closely related to our actual life. Everywhere, we should start with the things we come into contact with in daily life and make deep observations. For example, the fried oil fritters we see on both sides of the road when walking have chemical factors. Baking biscuits also has a chemical effect. In addition, lacquers and paints all have chemical principles. In short, if we can pay attention to observation everywhere and study them, we will naturally develop a strong interest in chemistry research.

C. Experiment more. Cramming-style reading of chemistry cannot arouse the interest in reading chemistry. If we start from experiments and get a clear understanding of many theories and phenomena, we can also arouse the interest of readers.

D. Visit more. As the saying goes, seeing is believing. If you are researching larger chemical problems, which cannot be solved in the laboratory, you should visit in many ways. Once you gain something, you will definitely increase your interest a lot.

### That's Just a Story

— Yin Gu

What is called a story, perhaps it is a thing of the past, call it a story; is it just that we will repeat the occurrence into a "new thing"? Then I can hardly determine. Let's first tell a foreign story below:

In the summer of 1788, the whole of France was in famine, and the price of grain was rising day by day, and the peasants and urban poor could not get food. The hungry "masses" rose up and "looted" grain treasuries and flour shops, and "attacked speculative merchants." The workers and coolies of Paris rioted, "destroying factories and factory owners' residences," and the whole city was in turmoil, and the people rose up in revolt...

This is a story that is more than 150 years away from now. The "speculative merchants" of the isolated island can avoid worry, and the "factories" and "factory owners' residences" will not be affected and destroyed, and, and that is a "fantasy", you can rest assured!

But, the summer of 1941 is approaching, that is, we become "that" Paris new things. Judging from the current market situation, even the storyteller can hardly determine...

### The "Greater Self" View of Life

— Jiang Bo

Returned after seeing "Life is But a Dream"

"Life is But a Dream" is said to be a famous play, which had a very high evaluation in the American film world. Now this play has been translated into Chinese. Generally speaking, it is indeed a light, lively and interesting script.

In the play, two different families are described: one is a family full of the joy of family, and each member of the family has their different hobbies, - not hobbies, but indulgently, - no, it should be freely working hard at it, such as those who like to write, those who like to make chemical firecrackers, those who like to study Peking Opera, and even those who like to collect stamps, etc. In short, there is absolutely no restraint or oppression in this family according to the free will, only full of happy work, and the warm and clear atmosphere of spring.

However, the situation of another family being described is different. What the family thinks and does all day long is the work of making money. Therefore, the whole family shows restraint, dullness, and lifelessness. However, the younger generation is not willing to submit to this for a long time. After feeling the propaganda of the former family, the younger generation in two different family environments, - but with a common will, finally broke through the obstacles and combined, and at the same time, even the stubborn old generation turned around and changed the goal of life. For "fame" and "profit", a lifetime of hard work is like an empty thought like a "dream"! What is mainly told here is that the "glory, wealth and riches" you are pursuing are all fleeting clouds, even if you achieve your goal. But being able to enjoy the leisurely and transcendent joy of self-sufficiency in life is the true happiness of life.

We look at everything at this time and place, like mud mayflies in the vast sea. Most of the creatures are running and scurrying for life, "fame" and "profit", and even causing the turmoil in the market at this time and the famine among the civilians. How much are those who are called "glory, wealth and riches" loved and pursued by people today? It seems that they can abandon all the necessities (recognized as necessities), but they cannot give up the pursuit of "glory, wealth and riches" for a day. Then, the performance of this "Life is But a Dream" has its realistic warning significance, let the obsessives of "wealth and glory" wake up for a moment, "Life is a dream", why bother so much?

However, what I think is regrettable is the non-positive nature shown to us by this play! Because according to what I have seen and felt, in addition to regarding "wealth and glory" as fleeting clouds, it is enough to seek the comfortable, free and joyful pleasure in the family and life; in fact, the acquisition of this peaceful pleasure is obviously too selfish and too humble. I think that at least when our living society is drumming with an unprecedented situation today, it is very inappropriate and very inappropriate for the psychology of enjoying pleasure and pursuing comfort and self-satisfaction to be popularized in the minds of the general public!

In the "View of a Striving Life" published continuously in this newspaper, there is a paragraph saying: "...Therefore, the reason why a person is a person is completely dependent on the society, and striving for the society is respecting the greater self, and it is also the inalienable duty of mankind!" This thoroughly explains what kind of concept of life we need to establish at this time and place!

We need to establish a "greater self" view of life!

### A Discussion on the Jinshan Mouth Shipwreck Tragedy

— Xiao Ya

On the morning of the ninth of this month, a shipwreck tragedy occurred at Jinshan Mouth in Hangzhou Bay. More than two hundred passengers were aboard, and only forty or so survived. The cause of such a tragic disaster is naturally the ship owner's and others' negligence of life due to greed for wealth. However, the passengers' lack of composure in responding to the emergency and the lack of unity in working together to avert the crisis are also among the reasons for this terrible tragedy.

According to reports, when the ship reached the sea off Jinshan Mouth, the wind and waves were fierce, and the ship was heavily loaded. The ship owner knew that danger was imminent and steered the ship towards the mudflats of Jinshan Mouth, but it was already impossible to save it, and the ship broke apart. Before it broke, the ship owner shouted loudly, ordering the passengers to disembark onto the beach, which was the right thing to do. However, if these two hundred or so people could have united and found a way to leave the ship, so many lives would certainly not have been lost. When leaving the ship, the first thing to do is to remain calm and not rush ahead of each other. After standing on the beach, everyone should join hands and form a human chain. Children should be carried on the backs of strong adults. This would make it difficult to be washed away by the waves, and even if someone was knocked down, they could be easily rescued, so there would be no fear for their lives. The more than forty people who went in the wrong direction and lost their lives at sea could also have been saved. After standing firm, observe the rising and falling of the tide. If the tide is rising, one should try to quickly go ashore. If the tide is receding, it may be best for everyone to stand still and wait for the tide to ebb a little before walking, or move forward slowly. Even if it takes until dawn to walk, it doesn't matter. Now, you go east, and I go west, each trying to escape, but in the end, no one can escape death.

These are times of great difficulty, and this shipwreck tragedy is a lesson for us.

### The Contradiction Between "Poor" and "Rich"

— Xu Daming

The Basic Factors of "Robbing" and "Hoarding"

"Man dies for wealth, birds die for food."

This has been the "way of life" since ancient times, and many people have spent their lives "struggling" under this "great" "goal," only to accumulate vast wealth and become bloated millionaires. Perhaps, once they close their eyes, they will "show filial piety" to their descendants. The so-called name of "filial" "son" probably originates from this. It seems that if parents don't work hard to accumulate some inheritance, they are letting their children down. This idea is held by many of our ancestors, no, even those living in the eleventh decade of the twentieth century still harbor this "great" "plan" and "idea." They truly deserve to be called "models" of parents.

This is one type of person who is desperate for money.

There is also another type who "live from hand to mouth," willing to do anything as long as there is money. They disregard all baseness and shame, believing that money is omnipotent. However, these people do not necessarily want to leave behind any inheritance, seeking only their own comfort, wealth, honor, and enjoyment.

This is another type of person who is desperate for money.

However, living is the most basic need of every human being, the spirit of all things, and in today's society where money is still needed, another type of person who needs money to live emerges.

However, strangely enough, money seems to be like the tide. Those who have money get more and more money, and they become happier, more powerful, and fatter. Those who are poor and miserable become poorer and poorer, more and more miserable, and more and more emaciated! Thus, two sides of society are created today.

At the same time, social unrest arises from the struggle between the "poor" and the "rich," and the conflict between "suffering" and "pleasure."

You want money, and I want money, so everyone racks their brains to come up with all kinds of despicable, shameless, insidious, and malicious methods, thus creating the strange development of today!

In the previous issue of this journal, Mr. Weiyang's article "The Cause and Effect of 'Robbing' and 'Nationalization'" pointed out that "robbing" is caused by "nationalization." I further say that the basic contradiction of this social phenomenon arises from the division between "poor" and "rich." I think no one will object to this statement!

Therefore, we say that we should see into the bone marrow. We must use scientific methods to extract the pus growing in the bone marrow and thoroughly eliminate the rotten bacteria inside.

(7) A Cross Scratched on His Face

It was dusk. The cotton-like white clouds in the sky had gradually turned grayish-brown. The fiery sun had also embarked on its final journey half an hour ago, with less than a quarter of its body remaining above the horizon, emitting some dark red light from the northwest, making it impossible for the heat in the air to decrease for a while.

In a small tavern near the tram tracks, two men in short clothes were drinking and talking, taking advantage of the remaining light of the sunset.

"Damn it! It's this one thing I can't figure out." A man with a face so thin that it was all skin and bones, his eyes wide open in a triangular shape, said, "You think our Commander has played with a lot of women over the past ten years, and none of them has ever given birth to a single egg. How is it that this one here can give him a son? If this woman's belly wasn't made big by Qiu Haitang, I, Ji Zhaoxiong, can cut off my head right away! I just can't figure out what tricks that kid used, that the child born doesn't resemble him at all, but it also doesn't resemble our Commander! To be honest, it doesn't even resemble the woman. It's probably some kind of hybrid they swapped out."

Sitting across from him was a young man with an open front, bare legs, and bare feet. A cigarette butt was stuck diagonally behind his ear. His face and body fully revealed an air of hooliganism. He took a sip of white liquor and put down his glass.

"Maybe you misjudged it."

"Only a bastard would misjudge it!" Ji Zhaoxiong had obviously drunk more wine than his specially invited guest, so he spoke more frankly than usual. "If he hadn't had an affair with someone else's concubine, what kind of relationship would I, Ji Zhaoxiong, have with him that he would obediently lend me one hundred and fifty [dollars]?"

Because it was still early, the people who usually drank at night hadn't arrived yet. Besides the two of them, there was only an old man from the countryside in the tavern.

"Besides, his not singing opera and constantly coming to Tianjin is a big loophole!" The young man nodded and said, "But, Ji Lao Wu, you're not generous enough! You only told me today that you got so much money from him. The past few times we were your errand boys, tracking him down everywhere, you always gave us one or two yuan of foreign money each time. We never even saw a five-yuan transportation ticket, you say..." (84)

### My Views on "Playing the Flower Drum"

— Wang Kui

Yesterday, in this journal, Mr. Qian Naijiang's article about "Playing the Flower Drum" stated, "Originally, it embodied revolutionary significance in the songs of flower drum women during the Ming Dynasty, spreading propaganda in the countryside and becoming a latent force among the people, which helped Hongwu drive out the Yuan Tartars, and its contribution was not small. But now, what is performed on stage is a flower drum woman, a heroic woman, transformed into a disguised prostitute." I sought guidance from Mr. Zhang Guyu on this matter, and according to Mr. Zhang's account, it differed greatly from Mr. Qian's article. Mr. Zhang said: "This play was written by Yuan loyalists in the early Ming Dynasty. Although it is listed among Yuan dramas, the time it was written was actually after the late Yuan Dynasty. A group of Yuan Dynasty loyalists, unable to restore their country, wrote this play and instructed actors to perform it in various places, all to disturb the hearts of the people. Looking at a Fengyang song, 'Beat the drums tightly, knock the gongs slowly, you old folks listen to me sing the rice planting song, I don't sing any other songs, listen to me sing the Fengyang song. Speaking of Fengyang, talking about Fengyang, Fengyang is a good place, but since Emperor Zhu came out, there have been nine years of famine in ten years. Wealthy families sell their fields, and poor families sell their children. I have no children to sell, so I carry the flower drum on my back and walk in all directions,' it can be proved that it is a propaganda play against the Ming Dynasty. Emperor Zhu is Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming Dynasty. It means that since Zhu Yuanzhang was born, there have been nine years of famine in ten years, the rich have become poor, and the strong have scattered in all directions. The Kunqu opera version is adapted from Yuan dramas, simply called 'Flower Drum.' Because Kunqu opera is a leisure activity for scholars and officials after tea and wine, the vulgar parts have been changed to be very refined, thus losing the true flavor, unlike the Fengyang woman selling songs on the street, it is like a little maid from the Yuanwai's mansion putting on a play. Peking opera follows this example, turning the flower drum woman into a young girl, not like a man's wife, but like a man's daughter. Also, because small plays all add the word 'Playing,' such as 'Playing Cherries,' 'Playing the City God,' 'Playing the Kitchen God,' 'Playing the Carrying Pole,' therefore 'Flower Drum' was changed to 'Playing the Flower Drum.'"

Southern Kunqu operas all have this play, but among the northern actors, only Mao Shilai has sung it in Shanghai. I saw Hua Huilin, Du Wenlin, and Han Jinkui perform together at the Golden Theater, which was very popular with the audience. Du Wenlin's crude movements and foolish demeanor were just like a bastard. Han Jinkui's sneaky face and glib mannerisms were truly a lustful ghost, acting like a suave playboy. With the petite, exquisite, charming Hua Huilin in the middle, it was naturally easy to please.

Besides the anti-Ming elements in this play, I think there are also some that depict the feelings of ordinary couples. So, as soon as she enters, the female lead sings (Carrying the flower drum on my back and holding the gong, husband and wife are as close as scales and weights, my face is pretty, and I can sing the rice planting song, walking through the streets and alleys, my feet are as fast as shuttles, I'm not afraid of crowds in the playhouse, my man, you beat the gong and I'll help with the drum, you beat the gong and I'll help with the drum.) And in the epilogue, it is (Having endured the hardships of wind and frost, there is only hunger and cold, alas! My man! I'll go through the streets and lanes with you, and sing with you again.)

### No Breakup: MacDonald and Eddy

Rumors were rife that Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy would break up, and "Bitter Sweet" would be their memorial work. This news has been confirmed to be untrue. It turns out that this is reverse publicity from the film company. It is now known that MGM has purchased the film adaptation rights to the famous Broadway opera "I Married an Angel" for a large sum of money, which will be a collaboration between the two of them.

### Vivien Leigh in London: Transatlantic Interview

— Chan

"Gone with the Wind" star Vivien Leigh and her husband Laurence Olivier quietly returned to their homeland after collaborating on the film "That Hamilton Woman" in Hollywood, which chronicles the career and love story of British Admiral Nelson.

A few days after they arrived in England, the famous American film reporter Louella Parsons received special permission from the British government to have a brief conversation with Vivien Leigh, who was far away in London, using a transatlantic telephone line from New York. This female reporter considered it the greatest and most exciting interview of her career, so she specially published it in Oregonian magazine so that fans could learn a little about Vivien Leigh and her husband's current situation. The following is a partial translation:

When I (Louella herself) heard Vivien Leigh's voice coming from afar, I said to her, "The Colmans, the Ritchies, the Cukors, and other Hollywood friends send their regards to you both and asked me to inquire about your current situation."

"Oh! Them?" she asked. "I must send my regards to them as well, because we both feel that we should do something for our country, so we have now returned to London with great pleasure!"

Ah! Her accent was completely unlike Scarlett O'Hara's in "Gone with the Wind." After returning to England, even her voice became very British. So, on the phone, I began to ask her some serious questions.

"What are you and Laurence Olivier doing now?"

"Laurence is currently filming a movie called "49th Parallel," and I am planning to prepare for a play. England needs good entertainment, so we are trying our best to do something in this area."

"Are there many plays being staged now?" I asked again.

"Oh! A few actors are working," she said. "But things seem to be very sluggish. The play "Dear Brutus" is being performed on stage every night. The people here are as calm as ever and very brave."

Finally, she said, "Please tell Hollywood to send more American films here."

Chapter 6: Briefly Intoxicated Beauty Beside the Brocade Zither

The magistrate of Qi County sneered and said, "I initially thought you were a disciple of Mencius and Lord Pingyuan, so when the bandits came to attack the city last time, I specially invited you to help defend the city. Who knew that you were colluding with the bandits of Green Stone Mountain. If it weren't for my keen observation, I would have almost been deceived by you." Li Xin hurriedly argued, "How can you say that I am colluding with the bandits? I am a great man, how could I be a thief?" The magistrate of Qi County said, "Don't quibble! The last time you were captured, I was already a little suspicious. Since the bandits came in large numbers, killing government soldiers, their power was not small, but why did they capture only you and then retreat? There must be a flaw in this. Therefore, I summoned all your Zhuang Ding and questioned them one by one in detail, and I finally found it out. One of them, named Fang Fatty, told me that the female bandit and her accomplices had come to your village before, claiming to sell their skills, but secretly discussed things. Your capture was a scam." Hearing this, Li Xin realized that Fang Fatty was the one who had been injured by the ten Red Maidens, so he held a grudge in his heart. So he said, "If I were colluding with the bandits, why didn't I open the door and welcome them in, and instead let myself be captured?" The magistrate of Qi County said, "I also thought about this, and sent people to Green Stone Mountain to secretly investigate, and then I learned that you had married the female bandit on the mountain and become a bandit leader. I guessed that you would definitely come back, so I kept quiet and secretly waited. Yesterday, Fang Fatty came to inform me, so I captured you today. You must have returned to the city this time to cooperate with them from the inside and outside, to devastate the area, how could I easily spare you?" Li Xin sighed deeply and was about to say more when the magistrate of Qi County ordered the constables to throw Li Xin into prison and keep a close watch on him. He also went to search Li's village, confiscating all of Li Xin's property, and putting the family members under surveillance. He prepared a document to report to his superiors, intending to execute Li Xin. After Li Xin was imprisoned, the iron chains clanged, and he experienced the taste of being behind bars. He felt unspeakable resentment in his heart. He had thought of escaping back because he refused to surrender to the bandits, but who knew that he would suffer such an injustice. Then, wouldn't my life be given away for nothing? We are sworn brothers, four of us, and three of them have joined the army, but I alone will die here. It's truly unjust! If I had known this, I would have stayed on the mountain with Red Maiden. So he sighed all day long and couldn't swallow his food. After a few days, one night, he was sitting alone in the darkness, listening to the silence around him. The prison was as silent as death, and he couldn't help but sigh deeply. Suddenly, a small point of light appeared in front of his eyes. It wasn't an illusion, it was real. His heart couldn't help but stir. (End of Chapter 6)

### Summary of the Philosophy of Diligent Practice

— Zong Yu

A person cannot be without life. Without life, there is no person at all. At the same time, having life does not necessarily mean being a person. There are many people in the world who are born but do not become human beings. My life must seek to be a life of a person, so that I will not fail my life. My life must have a view, and the view must conform to reality. This is the true meaning of the three words "worldview."

Since Zhang Huicong is pregnant and waiting to give birth, Kun Dan (female role) Han Suolan was invited to fill the vacancy by the Ping Theater in Xian Shi Amusement Park. Now, the Tianchan Stage wants to hire Suolan to replace Han Suqiu, who is on leave due to illness. However, the Xian Shi Amusement Park relies heavily on her and insists on keeping her, so Suolan can only decline the Tianchan Stage.

Movie star Wang Yin is producing a film at his own expense, originally titled "The Soul Returns to the Great Hatred," but he thought it was not popular enough. The night before last, he and Pei Chong studied this issue and wrote many titles such as "Tears Sprinkled on the Land of Longing," "Mandarin Duck Calamity," and "Heartbroken Flower." As a result, they thought "Heartbroken Flower" was more suitable, but it still needs to be carefully considered before it can be determined.
