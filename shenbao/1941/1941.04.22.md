### British Newspaper Comments on the Sino-Japanese War

London: The Times published an editorial entitled "China Continues to Fight," which stated:

The war in China is now entering its fifth year, and many misconceptions about China are gradually being dispelled. The most erroneous of these misconceptions is the idea that China cannot resist modern mechanized armies like the Japanese army. By Western military standards, the training, equipment, and staff work of the Chinese army are largely inadequate. Although it has inflicted some significant blows on the Japanese army, its strategic retreat since the fighting in Shanghai has often given people a different impression. However, its unwavering strategy has trapped over a million Japanese troops on the battlefield for four years. Although the Japanese continue to claim victory, they are in fact admitting their failure. Did the Japanese not say that the war against China could be ended in four weeks? Now, after four years of hard fighting, there is still no end in sight. The Japanese also have a delusion that the Chinese have never had national unity and that China is not a nation but merely a geographical term. However, although the Japanese have temporarily achieved some results by sowing the seeds of political division among the opposing factions during China's internal strife, they have ultimately been disappointed to see the unity of their military leaders in resisting foreign aggression. The Japanese are gradually feeling the harsh lessons in their efforts to blockade China. In theory, the entire Chinese coastline from the Bohai Bay in the north to the Tokyo Bay in the south is blockaded. However, in reality, as soon as the Japanese plug one gap, another leak immediately appears, like a leaky belt. The recent attacks suffered in the North Sea have indeed dealt a significant blow to the Chinese, disrupting their lines of communication and destroying valuable supplies. At the same time, the bombing of the Mekong River bridge on the Burma Road has not compensated for the loss of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. However, various supplies continue to flow into the Chinese interior from sources that the Japanese cannot hope to blockade. If the Japanese want to implement a complete blockade in the current situation, they must station a soldier every six yards along the coastline from the border of Manchuria to Vietnam. Even if this were possible, it would not be effective where there is a strong incentive to smuggle Japanese goods. The Japanese hope that the isolated government in Chongqing will only be a partial regime has also been shattered. When the Burma Road was previously blockaded, Chongqing received very little supplies. However, the reopening of the Burma Road, the loans from Britain and the United States to China, the visit of Coulee to China, and President Roosevelt's promise of aid have greatly encouraged the capital. China initially fought for its own sake and for the sake of Western democracies. This is now universally recognized. China now hopes to receive more supplies so that it can not only counter-attack the invaders but also secure its position in the overall world settlement. After all, China's future peace and security depend on the overall world settlement.

Chinese leaders are now discussing their difficulties and dangers with candor. This is one of the many changes that have occurred in China's four years of war. The authorities in Chongqing are now openly discussing the difficulties of high prices, shortages of goods, and this year's poor harvests in the inland provinces, as well as the Japanese disruption of the Chinese currency system, without the slightest concealment. They may also be considering the obstacles to the transportation of goods on the Burma Road. The appointment of Mr. Keith, a key figure in the American Red Cross in China, as Chairman of the Management Committee of this road is indeed a major step in the right direction. The many difficulties encountered by the Chongqing authorities are vast in scope and complex in nature. If another country were in this situation, it would be considered hopeless. However, the Chinese have proven in these four years that they know how to struggle and survive. This characteristic has been acquired through centuries of adaptation to various environments. Although the Japanese people's feelings about Chairman Chiang Kai-shek vary from time to time, his courage and perseverance have always been admired by the Japanese, even though they harbor frivolous hopes that his health may gradually decline, his followers may become scattered, and that he may go to the United States for rest and recuperation. They have never used derogatory language to describe him, as they acknowledge the greatness of his personality. The main support of China today and the main hope for its future lie in this greatness of personality. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, although bearing arduous and relentless hardships, remains in good health and high spirits. This is truly a blessing for China. It seems that nothing can make him cower, and nothing can shake his confidence in China's future. He has the characteristics to inspire the whole country with his own beliefs. Mr. Guo Taiqi recently said in London, "China has Chiang Kai-shek, just as Britain has Churchill and the United States has Roosevelt." Indeed, the future of human freedom depends first and foremost on these three leaders. Although Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's connection to national security is not as obvious as that of the British Prime Minister and the American President in the eyes of the world, its importance may be even greater. After all, the future of China's 450 million people can currently be entrusted to no one other than Chiang Kai-shek. Even his opponents know that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will not give up the struggle until the Japanese withdraw from China. Churchill said of Britain's main enemy that the war was launched by Hitler, but it cannot be ended by Hitler or his successors. The Chinese people feel the same way about the Japanese. Today, people are gradually realizing that one country can launch a war, but it takes two or more countries to make peace. (Reuters Telegram dated the 21st)

Editorial

### The Nature of the Zhejiang-Fujian Battles

In the past four or five days, Japanese forces have suddenly launched offensives against various coastal counties in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces; either forcibly landing under the cover of naval artillery fire, or launching attacks into the hinterland preceded by aerial bombings, or advancing southward from their strongholds on the southern bank of the Qiantang River. According to various sources, the areas affected by these Japanese disturbances include Shaoxing, Zhuji, Zhenhai, Linpu, Shibu, Haimen, and Ruian in Zhejiang; and Zhangyuan in Changle, and Daxiaao and Xiaoxiaoao at the mouth of the Lianjiang River in Fujian. As of the time of this writing, there are even reports that Japanese troops have captured Xiangbo and Wenzhou, resulting in street fighting. We deeply sympathize with the heavy casualties and destruction of prosperous production areas in the densely populated areas affected. However, recalling that at the beginning of the full-scale war four years ago, the Chinese government and people had already anticipated that the country would have to endure tragic sacrifices, and that the coastal and riverine provinces and counties would be the first to suffer this calamity. The fact that Zhejiang and Fujian have remained intact as a war zone for four years until today was not unexpected from the beginning, especially at this moment!

The simultaneous and multi-pronged attacks by the Japanese navy, army, and air force in Zhejiang and Fujian, seem to mimic Germany's blitzkrieg tactics. However, this is not the case. The essence of blitzkrieg tactics is the speed of movement and the concentration of combat power on a single focal point of the enemy's strength. It targets the enemy's vital points that must be defended, bypassing strong defenses, using the principle of converging from multiple directions, and launching a deadly blow with a fierce attack. Due to the high level of application and development of these essential elements, Germany has successively achieved extraordinary victories in Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Western Europe, and the Balkans before today. Comparing the current Japanese military operations in Zhejiang and Fujian with the essence of the so-called blitzkrieg tactics, it is practically nine mistakes out of ten and nothing is right. It is not worthy of being regarded as blitzkrieg tactics; it is only the "sporadic movement" of the same time and the same corner.

In modern warfare, on the one hand, the consumption is extremely large, and no amount of materials, whether in the tens, hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands, is sufficient. On the other hand, the maintenance, development, and application of all forces related to the war must be extremely precise and strict, without the slightest sloppiness, and meticulously calculated. From this point of view, we feel that the recent battles in Zhejiang and Fujian are, in the overall situation of the Sino-Japanese War, uneconomical for both sides. The initiator of this Zhejiang-Fujian battle is extremely foolish. Because, from the Japanese perspective, the Zhejiang-Fujian situation is not enough to affect the overall situation, let alone determine the overall situation. So what is the point of seeking to resolve the so-called China Incident? Therefore, regardless of the success or failure of the Japanese army in Zhejiang and Fujian, it only increases unnecessary consumption. If measured by the meticulous maintenance and development of all forces, it is far, far away. From the Chinese perspective, the destruction and loss of a city or town, although not related to the overall situation, at least has a relationship with the life and death of tens of thousands of people, and at least has a relationship with the gain and loss of tens of thousands of assets. Therefore, from the point of view of war power, one should not despise a city or town as if it were a weed. The matter is uneconomical for both sides, but the difference lies in the significance. The initiative is the result of Japan's folly, and the reactive combat is a matter of duty. Moreover, China's basic strategy is solely to cause the other side to continue to consume more and more.

Some say that Japan's latest launch is not at all frivolous, but aims to blockade the sea mouths in Zhejiang and Fujian, so that China can no longer obtain overseas assistance from these sea mouths, so the significance lies in the economy, and this move is not uneconomical. In fact, Japan's blockade of the sea mouths has long been implemented, so why wait for this landing operation? The reason why these sea mouths have not been absolutely suffocated in recent years is because there has been some kind of tacit understanding between the Japanese and foreign ships, not because the Japanese army has not landed, nor because Japan's blockade is not strong enough. Moreover, the amount of materials that these sea mouths handle to and from Southeast Asia in recent years is extremely small, and it is mostly to and from Shanghai. In recent years, Shanghai has been like an isolated island to the inland, and it is no different from the exclusive market for Japanese goods. Therefore, the result of Japan's absolute blockade of the sea mouths in Zhejiang and Fujian is only to make the Japanese goods in Shanghai lose the last chance to infiltrate Free China through Zhejiang and Fujian. From this point of view, is this move economical or uneconomical?

As for explaining it as the aftermath of the Soviet-Japanese Pact, as a military expansion after Japan's diplomatic success, as a manifestation of promoting the solution of the so-called China Incident, such claims are also not seen to be so. After the Soviet authorities declared that the Soviet-Japanese Pact would not change their policy of assisting China, it fundamentally lost its role as a tool for Japan to conduct nerve warfare against China, let alone its other roles against China. To say that the Soviet-Japanese Pact made Japan worry-free in the north and could transfer its northern garrison for other uses is not only fundamentally questionable, but it is also impossible to transfer troops to Zhejiang and Fujian in less than ten days after the signing of the pact. It can be seen that Japan signing the Soviet-Japanese Pact is one thing in diplomacy, and launching the Zhejiang-Fujian battle is another thing in military affairs, and the two are completely unrelated. If it is said that the essence of the Soviet-Japanese Pact does not help Japan solve the so-called China Incident, but Japan can regard this pact as enriching the keynote of Japan's implementation of its so-called national policy; due to the enrichment of this keynote, Japan can recklessly disregard everything and boldly act in Zhejiang and Fujian in order to implement its original intention of conquering China by military force. No one can deny this statement on behalf of Japan. However, from a purely military perspective, from a purely military strategic analysis, in international warfare, Zhejiang and Fujian are not disputed by military strategists, and they are definitely not the decisive battlefield for the entire Sino-Japanese War. Even in the isolated corner of Zhejiang and Fujian, although the Chinese side is determined to fight anywhere and is prepared to strike at any time, the area along the coast, along the Qiantang River and Min River, such as the area recently disturbed by the Japanese army, is definitely not the battlefield chosen by China for the decisive battle. A little deeper, there are towering mountains, which are the natural graves of the invaders!

### US President and Canadian Prime Minister Confer on Economic Cooperation; Both Countries Resolve to Mobilize All Resources to Assist Each Other in Defending the Western Hemisphere

Hyde Park: President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King agreed last night on a plan to mobilize all resources of the United States and Canada to defend the British Empire. Canada also promised to provide the United States with US$300 million worth of defense materials. According to a press release on the special meeting between the two leaders, other plans discussed by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister King included utilizing North America's production advantages in the fastest and most effective way to defend the two countries and the Western Hemisphere, and to assist Britain and other democratic countries by the US and Canada. A statement issued by the US and Canadian governments said the US and Canada mutually agreed to mobilize the continent's resources, and to mutually supply each other with defense materials that can be produced and produced quickly. The production program should also fit this objective. Although Canada has expanded production capacity several times since the start of the war, it still needs to obtain various defense materials from the United States. Canada will purchase these materials in the coming year, which will be several times more than in the past. On the other hand, Canada has the ability to quickly produce certain munitions and strategically important materials, such as lead and ships, that are urgently needed by the United States for its national defense. Although there is no precise estimate at present, it is hoped that Canada will be able to supply the United States with approximately US$200 million to US$300 million worth of these defense materials in the next twelve months. This quantity is small in the US national defense program, but many of these materials to be supplied to the United States are very important. The method of payment for the purchase of these supplies by the United States will be to use material assistance to Canada to offset the cost of Canada's purchase of goods from the United States, which is extremely important to the economic and financial relations between the two countries. Because some of the materials purchased by Canada from the country contain certain parts and materials for the equipment and munitions manufactured by Canada for the United Kingdom, the US and Canada also agreed that the United Kingdom may obtain these materials under the Lend-Lease Act, and they are allowed to be transported to Canada and included in the finished goods item. Details on technical friendship and economy will be formulated as soon as possible in accordance with the general principles agreed upon by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister King.

Hyde Park: Officials here called,

Since the meeting between US President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, the US and Canada have concluded an agreement to exchange national defense equipment to accelerate the defense of the Western Hemisphere and assist Britain. It is reported that Canada will supply the United States with US$300 million worth of national defense raw materials in the coming year to meet the urgent needs of the United States. US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Hopkins both attended the meeting. Unofficial sources today predicted that Britain's setbacks in the Balkans will accelerate and increase US aid to Britain. Reliable sources said that US officials were surprised by the rapid progress of the German army. It is reported that two weeks ago, various parties assured President Roosevelt that the Allied forces of Britain, Greece, and South Africa could at least contain the German and Italian troops for four months. However, it is strongly stated that the US government still believes that Britain will achieve final victory and still exist. It is pointed out that although the British Empire is suffering a fierce blow, it has not been damaged in the slightest. (International News Agency Telegram dated the 21st)

### Japanese Newspaper Expresses Dissatisfaction with Vietnam

### Well-Known German Submarine Commanders Suffer Setbacks - One Killed, One Captured - British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander Explains Victory in the Atlantic Naval Battle

London - First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander announced yesterday that two top German submarine commanders had met contrasting fates: one was confirmed dead, and the other captured. Commander Schepke, commander of German submarine U-100, perished when his vessel was sunk. Commander Kretschmer, commander of U-99, was captured when his submarine was sunk. These two officers were among the most highly decorated in the German navy. Kretschmer was known as the "Wolf of the Atlantic" and was credited with sinking more British ships than any other of his peers. The Germans' intense admiration for these two commanders illustrates that the deployment of submarines depends on outstanding talent. Their removal is a great relief. Alexander continued, stating that enemy ships sunk, captured, or scuttled amounted to 2,250,000 tons. The Atlantic war naturally has its ups and downs, and the situation is constantly changing. However, I can state with certainty that neither German submarines nor long-range aircraft are sufficient to defeat us. The strength of our navy and coastal defense forces is steadily increasing, and through close cooperation, enemy ship losses have been substantial. Moreover, with the increase in our destroyers and light anti-submarine vessels (corvettes) – (Translator's note: a new type of lightly armed, inexpensive vessel specifically for anti-submarine warfare) – German submarine losses are sure to increase dramatically. Victory in the Atlantic war can be achieved. Furthermore, the ten new Coast Guard cutters transferred from the United States are already in service and proving highly effective, many being larger than destroyers. These ships were originally intended for coastal patrol, but it is now said that they are even more useful for hunting down German pirates in the Atlantic. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)

London - First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, in a speech yesterday about the British victory in the Atlantic battle, said that the combined strength of the British Navy and Coastal Command had increased, and the number of escort destroyers and gunboats had also grown. The enemy's losses would be even heavier hereafter. The British would continue to fight until they won the Atlantic battle. "We must continue to fight, work, and struggle to restore the escort situation of the previous Great War. At that time, the British fleet was not solely responsible for the arduous task but was joined by the vast fleets of five Allied nations, with five times the number of destroyers we have today. However, the British Navy still maintains the lifeline open, which is truly remarkable. We have recently announced the capture of hundreds of enemy submarine crew members, but even more enemy submarine crew members have been buried at sea. I can guarantee that the numbers of enemy submarines destroyed reported to the Admiralty by British ship captains engaged in anti-submarine warfare are in no way exaggerated." Regarding the loan of ten U.S. Coast Guard cutters to Britain, the First Lord said that these patrol boats were mostly slightly larger than British destroyers and were originally used for customs enforcement, but he believed they were even more useful for protecting merchant ships and searching for German raiding vessels. The First Lord also said, "I see there are criticisms that the British Navy cannot prevent German and Italian reinforcements from arriving in Libya. It should be known that once we decided to provide aid to Greece, we had to undertake the significant task of sending a large number of troops and equipment to Greece. Thanks to the Navy, the troops and equipment have safely arrived in Greece. At the same time, we must continuously transport supplies to the American garrison in Libya. While some have expressed reservations about the enemy's ability to transport reinforcements, the British Navy has destroyed hundreds of thousands of tons of enemy transport ships. I believe the government's decision to assist Greece and the Navy's execution of its duties require no apology." The British Air Force bombers have given the enemy fierce counterattacks, which can be clearly seen in the German radio station's complaints about air raids after the attacks on Salonika and Piraeus, showing that the Germans disliked the air raids. The First Lord concluded, "We must continue to fight until we win the war." (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

### German Planes Fiercely Bomb London - Significant Material Damage - Churches and Other Public Buildings Damaged

London - Authorities, after receiving reports, recently disclosed that during the German air raids on London and its vicinity on Saturday night, thousands of incendiary bombs and large quantities of light and heavy high-explosive bombs were dropped on various districts along the Thames Estuary. The German High Command stated that this was another act of retaliation by the Germans for the British Air Force's repeated attacks on Berlin. Major fires broke out in the Thames docks, the Millwall Docks, and Greenwich. According to the U.S. Aviation Department, London suffered severe attacks with significant material damage, and casualties are expected to be high. Outside the London city center, bombs fell in the southeast, causing material damage in several locations, but few deaths or injuries. In one district of London with narrow streets and densely packed houses, buildings were damaged by bombs, while in other districts, public buildings such as hospitals, churches, and museums were also damaged. Health Minister Brown recently visited a bombed hospital, expressing admiration for the hospital staff's heroic dedication, such as a nurse who died while hurriedly rescuing ten children. A church was destroyed by incendiary bombs, but after clearing the rubble, a wedding was held in its porch yesterday. A town in East Anglia was attacked that night, with a heavier death toll than in previous raids. A district in that town that had been attacked several times was bombed again, suffering considerable damage. In many places in the southeast, hundreds of incendiary bombs were dropped in rural areas. Saturday night's bombing was the most intense that various small towns in East Anglia and near London had experienced in previous raids. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

London - An air raid warning was issued in London last night, lasting for a short time. As of late at night, there were no reports of bombs falling anywhere in Britain after dusk. Yesterday during the day, there was slight enemy aircraft activity over Kent and the northeast coast of Scotland. Bombs were dropped in two places in northeast Scotland, causing slight casualties.

### U.S. President Encourages Doctors to Serve in Britain

Hyde Park, New York - President Roosevelt issued a statement last night at his residence here, urging American doctors to volunteer to serve in British military and civilian hospitals. The statement said that the British Red Cross had asked the American Red Cross to forward a request for one thousand young American doctors to go to Britain to help alleviate the shortage of doctors in central hospitals. "I, in my capacity as president of the American Red Cross, wholeheartedly endorse this request. Those who wish to serve in British hospitals can register with the British Red Cross and receive the protection of the Geneva Red Cross Convention. The young doctors who are urgently needed in Britain can help restore the health of soldiers and civilians injured in this cruel war." (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

### Australia Denies Military Secret Pact With China and Other Countries

Sydney - Tokyo has reported that Britain, the United States, India, Australia, the Netherlands, and China have entered into a naval and military treaty. Australian Prime Minister Stewart has solemnly denied this. Furthermore, the Australian Defense Committee was not notified in advance about the deployment of Australian troops to Greece. Political circles and the press here have expressed dissatisfaction and are demanding that Parliament be convened to discuss the matter. Acting Prime Minister Fadden recently stated that the government was acting out of a certain "major policy" and would, of course, bear full responsibility for it. The British government did consult with them in advance and informed them of the military developments of various countries. (Havas dispatch of the 21st)

### Greece Continues to Shorten Lines - Fierce Rearguard Actions Underway - Athens Announces Fall of Larissa - German Forces Advance Westward Through the Pindus Mountains

London - Recent Allied military communiqués declare that the Allied front lines in Macedonia and Thessaly have not been breached by German forces. Fierce rearguard actions are underway, and fresh Greek troops are continuing to withdraw to shorter lines. German losses are reportedly substantial, though mechanized units, infantry, and aircraft continue to arrive as reinforcements. Simultaneously, German High Command communiqués declared that German forces are now pursuing British and Greek troops across the Thessalian plain, east of the Pindus Mountains. This demonstrates that the lines held by Allied forces have been completely breached. The Germans also claimed to have captured large numbers of Greek soldiers. German air forces, having participated in the capture of Larissa, bombed and strafed retreating enemy troops. According to neutral diplomatic sources in Bucharest, Yugoslavia continues to resist, with numerous German reconnaissance units being killed by raiding parties. In the region northwest of Skopje, an armed mobile force of over 8,000 men is advancing southward, attempting to reach the Greek lines. This mobile force has also laid mines in other areas and lured enemy troops into ambushes. German losses in the area of Kacanik are estimated at 223 destroyed tanks, 9,500 dead, and 20,000 wounded. In the current situation, German forces in the south appear not only undiminished but are actually increasing their garrisons to maintain order. The former pro-Axis Prime Minister Zivkovic was reportedly seriously wounded when Belgrade was bombed. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

Berlin - German pilots reported yesterday that British forces were retreating towards Lamia, which is near the site of the historically significant Battle of Thermopylae. In 480 BC, Leonidas led 300 Spartan warriors in a desperate defense of the Thermopylae pass, all perishing in the process. However, the large Persian army was prevented from conquering Greece. This battlefield is only 120 miles from Athens. Berlin had long predicted that the capture of Lamia would be a significant blow to Greece. (International News Service dispatch of the 21st)

Berlin - German military sources report that after German forces crossed the northern Greek mountain valleys and pursued the British and Greek Allied forces, German shock troops have now crossed the Trikala-Larissa line. The road from Larissa through Lamia to Athens is a key route for retreating troops and is now under intense German air bombardment. Enemy forces on the Epirus front are retreating toward Ioannina, pursued by German and Italian air forces. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)

Berlin - This afternoon's German military report claimed that German forces advancing in Greece were in pursuit of the enemy beyond Larissa and heading south. Others, passing through the Pindus Mountains and advancing westward, had already occupied the key pass of Metsovo. Within Albania, Italian forces continue to advance, reaching the Greek border in several locations. German aircraft attacked British troop transports not far from the west coast of Greece. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 21st)

Athens - Official reports recently stated that German forces have occupied Larissa after dreadful street fighting. British forces have withdrawn to a new, shorter, and more defensible line south of this strategically important eastern city. This new line extends to the foothills, with artillery and troops already in place. It is claimed that the Germans have employed Stukas in Larissa. While German forces, amidst fierce aircraft attacks and fires, were attacking every position held by British troops with tanks and machine guns, British forces fought their way out of the city. (Associated Press dispatch of the 21st)

Berlin - It was announced here this morning that Führer Hitler, at a secret headquarters somewhere in the Balkans, personally commanded hundreds of German tanks rumbling down into the Thessalian plain, overrunning Larissa and Trikala, and routing the retreating British and Greek forces. It is claimed that the British forces are "in headlong retreat," clogging roads and filling the area between Larissa and Lamia, suffering heavy casualties from German air bombardment. (International News Service dispatch of the 21st)

Athens - A government spokesman stated today that due to the German advance into Macedonia, the rear and flanks of the Greek forces were under attack. Therefore, the Greek forces on the Italian front continued to make a very orderly strategic retreat yesterday. The tasks facing the Greek forces are very heavy, but all movements are proceeding smoothly and in an orderly manner. For example, in making difficult movements according to the orders of the High Command, the Greek forces not only demonstrated their bravery but also repulsed Italian forces everywhere, and sometimes even attempted counterattacks to harass them. One Italian force counterattacked with tanks, but the Greek forces repulsed them. (United Press dispatch of the 21st)

German Occupation of Mount Olympus - British and Greek New Line Remains Firm

Cairo - People here still view the Balkan war situation as serious. According to well-informed sources in Cairo, Mount Olympus, on the right flank of the Allied forces, was occupied by German forces after the British withdrawal. This was part of a pre-planned British strategy to shorten the line under heavy attacks by enemy armor and mechanized forces. Although the German forces suffered terrible losses, they continued to attack with large numbers of troops. Athens radio broadcast a Greek Information Ministry communiqué stating that the Allied forces had modified their line in several locations, but the line remained firm. The German forces were constantly attacking the entire British and Greek lines, hoping to achieve a quick and decisive victory, but they were unsuccessful. The Germans brought in more mechanized units, with infantry and aircraft constantly reinforcing them, making every effort to attack. However, the British and Greek forces, fighting bravely like lions, held their lines tightly. The Germans pressed forward densely, like a giant wave crashing in, sparing no cost to seize the passes in the Kalabaka area, but ultimately failed, suffering heavy casualties. The German attack on the Mount Olympus area also sacrificed thousands upon thousands of soldiers, yet they still failed to break through the Allied lines. The heroic deeds of the Australian and New Zealand troops there added to the glory of Mount Olympus. Furthermore, a British Air Force communiqué stated that the British Air Force continued major operations for the past two days, with considerable success. German dive bombers, protected by fighter escorts, attempted to attack British land forces and ships in the port of Chalcis but were intercepted by British fighter patrols. Yesterday, ten German aircraft of various types were shot down, and many more were severely damaged. The British fighter planes suffered no losses. Furthermore, British fighter planes severely damaged several Italian aircraft over Milos. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

Cairo - Mount Olympus, the home of the gods in ancient Greek mythology, has now fallen into Nazi hands.

British Newspapers Realistically Discuss the Situation - Withdrawal from Greece Is Inevitable

London - Today's newspapers commented on the situation in Greece, stating that the British Empire's forces and Greek forces are currently standing shoulder to shoulder in the world's largest defensive battle. Regarding the possible outcomes of the overall situation in Greece, all offer realistic critiques, without illusions. The newspapers highly praised the unwavering determination of the Greek forces and the spirit of the Australian troops resisting the strong enemy. The Daily Mail openly discussed the possibility of a British withdrawal from Greece, stating that since the southern Balkan nations could not form a common front, it has been clear that we could not long withstand the tremendous pressure from the German forces. Greece is our ally, and we have a responsibility to stand in solidarity for the sake of honor, but we must decide when the Greeks believe that the time has come to withdraw from Greece. This time seems almost inevitable. The Germans hold absolute air superiority in Greece, and the decisive factor in the air, which will determine the outcome, is now reappearing. An editorial in The Times similarly recalled that although the United States had guaranteed aid to Greece, Greece had already decided to resist a German invasion, regardless of whether there was British assistance. It is simply absurd to suggest that Britain could have taken a better course than sending troops to fight in Greece. When the Empire's forces began landing in Greece, they had not embraced the possibility of forming an alliance with Greece to resist aggression, which would have thwarted any hope of stopping the German onslaught. For various reasons, unity has not been achieved, allowing the Germans to carry out a strategy of divide and conquer. They will conquer those who can be threatened by threatening them and conquer those who cannot be threatened by force. We may hear more bad news soon. If this news comes with disappointment, it should not be blamed on our current actions but on unfortunate and ineffective facts in the past. However, all the newspapers have optimistic comments about the future, believing that once the other troops currently gathering arrive on the scene, they will eventually defeat Hitler. An editorial in the Daily News stated that the great war in the East will not end soon, and the Nazi forces will certainly choose to strike forcefully where the sea does not restrain them. However, the power to command a major war with the combined forces of the sea, land, and air lies with us, not with Hitler. (Reuters dispatch of the 21st)

Londoners Speculate on Germany's Next Step

London - As German forces have invaded the Thessalian plain in Greece, British figures here have been speculating on Hitler's next step: driving Britain out of the Mediterranean. Several military commentators predict that the British Empire forces will face the great challenge of defending the routes through the rugged mountains south of the plain to Athens. Experts predict that the British and Greek forces will retreat again to shorter lines, which were 150 miles long several days ago but are now only about 75 miles. Mr. Hurd, the famous military expert of the Daily Mail, predicted that the new British and Greek line will be in the mountainous area from the Gulf of Lamia to the Gulf of Atalanti. He said that if the right wing of the British and Greek forces is stationed just north of the Gulf of Lamia, there will be more protection. However, if the right wing is located on the gulf near the historically famous pass of Thermopylae, the line will be shorter. Diplomatic experts, in speculating on Hitler's next move, are closely watching the situation in Turkey. They already have some confidence in the situation in Iraq, as strong British forces have arrived in Basra. A Daily Mail reporter in Istanbul believes that the statement in the Berlin communiqué that German Ambassador von Papen will not return to Turkey for at least two weeks indicates that Hitler wants to make "impossible demands" on Turkey as soon as German forces complete their military operations in Greece. The newspaper said that Germany will certainly demand that Turkey abandon its alliance with Britain and give Hitler the convenience of acting in western Asia, so that Hitler can attack Britain's position in the Mediterranean from both the east and west. In discussing the results of the Spanish cabinet meeting, a diplomatic reporter for the Daily Chronicle predicted that Spain may either join the Tripartite Pact or take action in Morocco to expel the Sultan's suzerainty, or possibly do both simultaneously. However, a diplomatic reporter for The Times argued that news from northern and central Europe indicates that Germany is talking about attacking the Soviet Union. The reporter said that there is certainly a faction in Berlin that is clamoring for an immediate attack on the Soviet Union, and Hitler may be allowing them to talk freely in the hope that these statements will reach Moscow's ears, so that Moscow can quickly give Germany more economic concessions and avoid the day of doom.

### Spanish Cabinet Meets for Several Days; Rumors of Major Decisions; Foreign Minister Suñer Reports on International Situation, Paying Particular Attention to Recent British Setbacks

Madrid: After two days of meetings, the Spanish cabinet concluded yesterday evening, issuing an official report stating, "Foreign Minister Suñer delivered remarks on all aspects of important military and diplomatic events in the current international situation." The Spanish Fascist Party's Arriba newspaper published an article based on this, which was quite similar to the language it used when Spain was about to make a political decision. It stated, "Discussions that are contrary to the sole foreign policy that guides our destiny cannot be considered. Our views on foreign policy must be unified. Anyone who thinks otherwise is a cowardly traitor." (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

London: According to news from Madrid, it is generally believed that Spain will make a major decision regarding the war after two days of cabinet meetings. Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer reported to the Spanish cabinet members on the latest developments in the international military and diplomatic situation, paying particular attention to recent British setbacks. Some observers here believe that a powerful faction in the Spanish government, with the help of Axis pressure, is attempting to drag Spain into the war, hoping to get a share of the spoils after Britain's defeat. However, it is reported that other elements in Spain favor continuing to maintain neutrality because they believe that Britain will overcome the crisis in the next few days and gain the upper hand. It is said that General Franco's advisors said that the war situation might have unexpected changes, they also pointed out "the lessons of Italy", when Italy joined the war, it was believed that the result of the war, all democratic countries will be defeated. Everyone knows that the United States' foreign policy will strongly oppose Spain's joining the war. Spain is already in a state of famine. The Spanish ambassador to the United States is appealing to the United States for food relief to the Spanish people, and the United States has already provided some relief. If Spain joins the war, it will no longer be able to expect assistance from the United States. Domestically it will have to deal with famine and externally it will have to defend against British attacks. (International News Service dispatch, 21st)

Madrid: Neutral sources speculate that Spain is very likely to announce cooperation with the Axis powers, and there is a possibility of assisting the Axis powers in attacking Gibraltar, invading Portugal, or occupying the Azores as a submarine base. It is believed that Spain's assistance to the Axis powers will not be in actively participating in the war, but in complying with the Axis powers' wishes without hindrance.

Miscellaneous Notes on the European War (4) (6)

### A Panoramic View of the American Navy

The Naval War College students show the greatest interest in indoor simulated battles. Of course, a simulated war cannot be compared to a real one. However, the theory of combat is always the same. What is worrying is that, based on past experience, before a battle, everyone always feels that everything is strategically arranged very carefully and calculated very precisely. Who knew that one mistake would cause everything to go wrong, making it impossible to salvage. The reason for this, of course, must be attributed to human negligence and mistakes. All training goals in military schools are based on completeness and meticulousness, so that the American naval power can respond to any different environment. Its meticulousness is only comparable to that of German military experts. Whenever a strategy is determined, if the environment changes, then all tactics will immediately change accordingly.

The tactics of indoor simulated battles are of course perfect and flawless. Each toy warship model represents a part of the naval power of a certain country. The tonnage, firepower, and special points of all warships are clearly marked, so those participating in the battle can clearly understand the strength of themselves and the enemy. Each time a simulated battle is conducted, the combat strategies of both sides, as well as the formations and transfer steps, are strictly kept secret, and each is separated by a curtain to prevent the other side from seeing. The instructor acts as the referee and informs the students of the sea weather and wind direction in advance. The students then mobilize their troops and generals, doing what a commander-in-chief should do. They even avoid speaking casually, fearing that their combat plan will be inadvertently leaked out, harming the national interest.

Small black curtains represent smoke screens. Airplanes are suspended on poles, and their flight altitude is also noted. The course of the ships is marked with chalk on the painted cloth on the ground. The commanders of the submarine teams and air squadrons of both sides are in other rooms waiting for orders, ready to be mobilized. During the stipulated time, the commanders arrange their formations, the speed or direction of various warships, open various artillery fire, release smoke screens, send out reconnaissance planes, or bomb enemy supply ships. Everything is like a real battle, allowing no carelessness.

The referees sit behind the partition wall, carefully watching the actions of both sides and calculating the degree of damage suffered by both fleets. The calculation method is based on the strength of a certain ship as recorded in the "Regulations" book. For example, if a warship has encountered a certain amount of artillery fire or bombing damage, then its combat effectiveness will be lost to a certain extent. Such battles take a week, and then the referees make a final criticism and decide whether the attacking fleet has completed a certain task or even encountered failure.

Famous naval battles in history are often re-enacted indoors. The Battle of Jutland in 1916, in which the British navy made mistakes that affected the overall situation, is often brought up in the Naval War College as material for exercises. When the British and German navies fought at sea, it lasted only twelve hours, but in the classroom, this battle took three weeks to fight. Sometimes, in order to test the students' resourcefulness, the instructors often raise some "quick-decision problems," asking them to give answers in three to five minutes.

The Naval War College authorities often invite army or Marine Corps officers, as well as ambitious diplomatic personnel, to listen to their lectures in order to "copy" Hitler's so-called military diplomacy, integrating action and speech. Within the Naval War College, students do not wear uniforms, and it is often the case that the students' rank is higher than that of the instructors. There are a total of 22 instructors and 40 experts teaching at the school. Therefore, the number of teachers is now more than the number of students. The school's library contains 75,000 specialized books related to the navy. There are no exams or grading in the school, but students with high ability always take the lead. In addition to normal coursework, there is also a correspondence department, which is designed for students who cannot come to the school in person to study. On the whole, this Naval War College cannot be called the best military school, but comparatively speaking, it is always among the best in the world.

(5) Training of Sailors and Officers

Having warships without personnel means that millions of tons of steel cannot exert their power. Talking about navigation is so difficult that one must devote one's life to it to have any hope of success. What's more, warships bear the heavy task of killing the enemy and achieving results. In the turbulent seas, there can be no errors in the combat staff room, and the artillery turrets must be fully coordinated. It takes six years of enlistment training to create a sailor. The time to build a warship is only the same.

The United States has no shortage of sailors in terms of manpower supply. In the next four years, even if the two-ocean navy needs 300,000 sailors, there will be no difficult problem. Because the number of American naval recruits is always maintained to a considerable extent, and there is never a shortage. Those who become sailors should ideally have a third-year junior high school education, and their intelligence and physical strength are most qualified at this time.

American youths who are 18 years of age have the qualifications to join the navy as sailors. After joining, they will first undergo six weeks of basic training at the "Great Lakes Naval Training Station" in Lake Michigan. Then they are sent to warships, living in "narrow alley" style cabins with twenty people, to earnestly learn all the skills of being a sailor. Obeying discipline and enduring hardship, everything is very strict. Unless he transfers to the "Annapolis" Naval Academy, he will only be a private for the rest of his life and will never be able to wear the gold thread badge, let alone become a naval admiral. But there are many kinds of courses that sailors can learn. There are as many as 59 learning places on shore, and by learning step by step, they can also gain a small "future". (To be continued)

### British Forces in Abyssinia Pursue Defeated Italian Army, Advance to Suburbs of Italian Stronghold of Dessie; German Attack on Tobruk Repelled

London: Reuters learned today that King Selassie of Abyssinia is expediting arrangements to return to the Abyssinian capital, Addis Ababa.

It is also reported that British forces attacking the defeated Italian army have advanced to the suburbs of Dessie, one of the last strongholds of the Italian army in Abyssinia. According to sources in Cairo, the war in Abyssinia is bound to slow down slightly because British forces need to clear up the remnants of the Italian army on all sides. Well-informed sources in Cairo also said that there were no signs of change in the situation of the Axis forces in Libya. It has been revealed that among the British forces defending Tobruk are Indian troops and mechanized units. It has been a long time since the Indian army participated in the Western Desert War. A British communique stated that the British Air Force is currently bombing Axis forces and military targets concentrated in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, inflicting heavy damage. Enemy motor transport convoys in areas such as Bardia have also been destroyed. British fighter planes continue to conduct offensive patrols, inflicting heavy damage on enemy motorized troops, and strafing the Gazala airfield, destroying several Italian aircraft on the ground. Two German fighters were also shot down at Gazala. A German dive bomber attacked Tobruk and was shot down by British fighter planes, and several others were damaged. On the 18th of this month, British bombers attacked Benghazi at night, hitting ships, and the docks also caught fire. Tripoli was also heavily bombed on the same night, with 15 tons of bombs landing, hitting ships and embankments. Enemy positions and motor transport convoys in the Dessie to Allomata area were bombed and strafed, and fortifications and military buildings were also hit by heavy bombs. South African aircraft went into action, strafing enemy motor transport vehicles north of Dessie, inflicting heavy damage, and oil pools also caught fire. Malta was attacked by enemy aircraft at night, causing minor damage to civilian houses, with slight civilian casualties. One of the attacking German planes was shot down at sea, and one British plane also went missing. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)

New York: A telegram was received stating that British political figures speculate that the British government intends to adopt the political system used during the First World War and establish an "Imperial War Conference" in London. All British autonomous towns will send representatives to the conference. However, at present, autonomous region representatives may be temporarily invited to participate in the British wartime cabinet meeting first, so as to quickly decide on important matters. Australian Prime Minister Menzies has already participated in the wartime cabinet meeting and has agreed to Churchill's request to stay in London for some time. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser has already set off for Britain, and the number of diplomatic representatives from Canada and the South African Federation will increase in the short term.

### American Military Transport Ships Join Shipping

Washington: American Maritime Commission Chairman Land yesterday announced that arrangements have been made for American military transport ships to load ores, jute, and other goods related to national defense from overseas and transport them to the United States. Land said in a speech at the National Democratic Women's Club that the government must decide whether to use military transport ships to load goods based on their importance. Land also said that the Maritime Commission maintains close contact with the Army, Navy, and private shipping companies because it wants to transport national defense supplies to naval bases in both oceans, and it is called that the Maritime Commission is now trying to maintain routes to meet the increasing demand for shipping.

### Pope Urges Belligerent Countries to Pay Attention to Humanity

Vatican: One thousand university students, doctors, lawyers, and others from Italian Catholic organizations met with the Pope.

When a nation is waging war for its glory or self-defense, humanity and charity will not weaken the people's bravery and patriotism, nor will they hinder their combat effectiveness, but according to the meaning of charity, it must not attack or kill innocent people, and must not kill indiscriminately even to the enemy other than those who need to be. The world does not need vanity and violence, but charity and love. (United Press dispatch, 21st)

At that time, a large number of farmers gathered at the station to cheer and pay their respects. After getting off the train, Marshal Pétain went to the war memorial to lay a wreath and then gave a broadcast speech here, calling on farmers across the country to work together and participate in the restoration work, briefly stating that the best way for farmers to assist the government is to engage in their own work to facilitate the government in solving the most pressing and difficult food problem. The government has already taken various steps for farmers across the country to improve their lives, the most important of which are the following: (1) To form a combination of farmers across the country, (2) To raise the status of farmers in society, (3) Modernization of agricultural equipment, (4) Government promulgation of rural laws, (5) Re-distribution of land property, in short, the government should adopt a practical policy on land, changing the abuses that have occurred in the past. The largest reform of all is the amendment of the primary school curriculum to include agricultural education. However, the government's concern for farmers is not enough to save the country, so it is hoped that all farmers across the country can abide by discipline, supply all the products owned by the land for national consumption, and adapt to the current environment, devote themselves to work, and increase production, and must cherish any items and never waste them. If they are useful, they must be fully utilized. At present, the domestic food problem is quite serious. The systems and methods adopted by the government for this problem must be understood, and must be followed and implemented. Farmers in our country have always been known to the world for their hard work and endurance, we must respect them, which is essential for the survival of the motherland, and it is no different from soldiers defending the motherland. All my farmers, do not be discouraged, and if you encounter difficulties and be discouraged, reducing work, only enough to maintain the needs of a family, then the result will be that the food problem will become more difficult. In short, I trust the farmers, and I believe that you will be able to help me complete the great cause of saving the country and restoring the nation. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

### Finance: Rumors Support Black Market; Foreign Exchange Turns Tight Amidst Stability

Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, the exchange rates listed by HSBC and other banks remained flat, but the black market rates for British and American currencies suddenly tightened amidst extreme stability. This was due to various rumors of banks lacking supply and gold prices soaring. Speculators slightly increased their purchasing after the morning opening. The Bank of England and HSBC offered substantial sales, while Chartered Bank and American banks showed interest in absorbing the supply, and Chinese banks also slightly sold off. The supply and demand for American currency were balanced in the morning, leading to stability. British gold was absorbed by the Japanese bank Mitsui and the exchange rates for American and British currencies rose by .25, causing them to soften. The closing price for British currency remained at 3 pence and .2875. The afternoon started stably, but around 3:30 PM, rumors spread that the war in eastern Zhejiang was intense, Fuzhou was in a state of emergency, and the Hong Kong Exchange Fund would abandon maintaining the city's foreign exchange. The price of gold soared again, and speculators rushed to sell, causing chaos. The price of American currency rose to 5.15625 yuan, eventually retreating slightly to 5.1875 yuan. British gold also softened to 3 pence and .1875. American currency tightened by .0625, and British currency tightened by .03125. Trading was quite active.

The Morning Market Was Quite Stable

Since the morning, foreign telegrams indicated a slight increase in silver and no market in American and British currencies. The exchange rates for various countries showed the American dollar appreciating against the British pound by .25, and the British pound depreciating against Shanghai by .0625, with all else unchanged. At the early market opening, banks' selling prices for spot British currency were 3 pence and .21875, and for American currency 5.25 yuan. The Russian currency softened slightly, and transactions were difficult to close even at the listed prices. Speculators were few. The May futures were quoted at 5.05 yuan, and the HSBC listing remained unchanged. Later, HSBC sold to Chartered Bank and Citibank April futures at 5.05 yuan, and the Japanese bank Mitsui bought April British gold at 3 pence and .03125, showing a slight softening trend. The American currency was flat. Speculators rushed to sell April American currency at 5.25 yuan. Midday trading became scarce. The midday closing prices were 3 pence and .23125 for British gold and 5.25 yuan for American currency.

A Rush to Sell Erupted Suddenly

The afternoon started stable, and speculators rarely sold. Until after 3 o'clock, a sudden tightening occurred, and rumors spread. The price of gold was reported to be soaring, and speculators rushed to sell May American currency. The market was in chaos, and banks lacked the willingness to supply. The price rose from 5.21875 yuan to 5.1875 yuan, with the lowest being 5.15625 yuan, before slightly stabilizing. At the 4 o'clock closing, both spot and May futures were at 5.1875 yuan for American currency, and British gold also tightened to 3 pence and .1875, which was .0625 tighter for American currency and .03125 tighter for British currency than the midday closing on the previous Saturday.

### Foreign Currency Market Surges in the Aftermarket

Yesterday in the foreign currency market, the black market prices suddenly surged in the afternoon. British and American gold pounds followed, rising by 3 yuan, and British gold notes also rose by 1 yuan. American gold notes were initially very stable, but after 3:30 PM, frequent rumors of positive developments caused the market price to surge straight upward. The evening market reached as high as 19.10 yuan, which was a rise of .43 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The demand for Hong Kong notes was also strong, and the market price also rose. Philippine notes suddenly had demand, and the market price rose sharply. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both trended firmly upward, with the former reaching as high as 2.08 yuan and the latter rising to 1.83 yuan.

### Gold Market Surges Suddenly in the Evening; New High Price Reaches 6740 Yuan; Settlement Price for American Currency Turns Higher

Yesterday's black market gold market suddenly experienced an unexpected surge. In the early morning, it did not follow the upward trend of the previous weekend's afternoon and only rose modestly, presenting a winding situation. Unexpectedly, within the 45 minutes before the evening close, it suddenly surged dramatically, leaping over the 6,700 yuan mark. Sentiment from all quarters was strangely firm, entirely driven by rumors. It was said that the war in eastern Zhejiang was expanding, Fuzhou was in a state of emergency, and it was also rumored that the Hong Kong Exchange Fund would abandon maintaining the city's foreign exchange. The foreign exchange rate was reported to be tightening sharply, exacerbating the situation. Cheng Kee and Yi Yuan sold a small amount in the morning at 6,610 yuan, but later came back to buy. Securities firms De Fu and Guangdong firms also started to compete for purchases, leading to a fierce short squeeze. Before the evening close, the price soared to a high of 6,740 yuan, a sharp rise of 130 yuan. The entire day's trading was chaotic, with an estimated turnover of over 50,000 taels. Swaps (April rolling into May) were offered by sellers to buyers at 33.5 yuan. The cash price also rose, with gold shops selling to silversmiths 100 taels at a price 155 yuan higher than the futures price. Later, Yi Feng offered 80 taels, and Yong Cheng and He Sheng each offered 50 taels, all of which were bought by Xiang Xing Yong at a price 160 yuan higher. In the afternoon, He Sheng and others sold to gold shops over 300 taels at a price 155 yuan to 150 yuan higher than the futures price, also a rise of 130 yuan. Jewelry gold reached 710 yuan, a rise of 10 yuan.

Black Market Rises 130 Yuan

Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 6,620 yuan at 9:15 AM, which was 20 yuan higher than the midday closing price on the previous Saturday. Xin Feng Yong vigorously bought, pushing it up to 6,640 yuan, but the foreign exchange rate was very stable, and Cheng Kee and Yi Da came to sell, causing it to fall back by over 20 yuan, to around 6,620 yuan, where it briefly fluctuated. Yi Yuan, Yi Feng, and Xin Yuan came to sell, and around 10 o'clock, it fell to 6,610 yuan. Exchange brokers then came to buy, and Xin Feng Yong and Da Feng absorbed it to between 6,633 and 35 yuan, fluctuating for a long time. Yi Da absorbed it, pushing it up again to 6,640 yuan. Retail investors sold, bringing it down to 6,628 yuan. The midday closing price was 6,632 yuan. The afternoon opened at 2 o'clock at 6,635 yuan, quickly reaching 6,638 yuan. De Da, Da Feng, and Xin Feng Yong came to sell, retreating to 6,629 yuan. Afterward, it hovered around 6,635 yuan, with only a few yuan of fluctuation. After 3 o'clock, the foreign exchange rate was reported to be tight, and various positive rumors also arose, stimulating buying. Securities firm Yi Da vigorously bought, and Da Feng, Cheng Kee, Yi Yuan, Heng Kee, De Fu, He Sheng, De Da, and others tended to compete for purchases. Sellers watched, and the price soared over 100 yuan, breaking out of the 6,700 yuan mark, rising to 6,740 yuan. De Da came out again to sell, and retail investors also sold, retreating to 6,705 yuan, but the sentiment was upward, and buying soon started again. The 4 o'clock closing price was 6,730 yuan, which was 130 yuan higher than the midday closing price on the previous Saturday. Based on the selling price of May American currency at 5.1875 yuan, it was 6,713.25 yuan, an actual premium of 16.75 yuan. After the market closed, Yi Yuan sold up to 6,718 yuan, and the final price was 6,725 yuan. The entire day had a fluctuation of 130 yuan. The selling price of cash gold by gold shops was 170 yuan higher than the black market futures price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot gold.

Jewelry Gold Listed at 710 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops, Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, rose by 10 yuan at 4 o'clock in the evening, reaching 710 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 40 yuan. At the evening market of 1,000 yuan, no one was willing to sell. One original package of "small twist" rice has reached 156 yuan, with Saigon rice trading at premiums of 600-700 yuan to 800-900 yuan per hundred bags. Because transactions are few and small twist rice is more active, its price is higher. Therefore, the selling price of Ying Hua Company's No. 1 Saigon rice was 150 yuan in the early market, rising to 153 yuan, and 155 yuan in the afternoon. No. 2 rice traded at premiums of 500-600 yuan, broken rice also had a premium of 500 yuan, and "rough" rice had a premium of 300 yuan. Based on these premium prices, some were calculated according to Ying Hua Company's rates, while others were paying a premium on top of the initial listed price. The reason for the high market price is still the rumors of the current situation that stimulate sentiment. In reality, 200,000 bags of stored rice were added last week, with 30,000-50,000 bags arriving every day. Orders last week included 150,000 bags of broken rice and 150,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice. The number of direct orders was even greater, and new orders were still going smoothly. However, some unscrupulous merchants ignore the facts, only seeking to profit, absorbing and shouting high prices. Yesterday's actual sales were less than 20,000 bags, while the trading volume of Ying Hua Company rice by hoarders was extremely large. There were also Ningbo merchants hoping for the fall of their hometown, buying and storing large quantities in order to obtain huge profits. However, they can still gain a reputation for providing relief.

Foreign Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai: The Taikoo Company's Hunan ship, loaded with 12,649 bags of foreign rice and 2,458 bags of corn from Hong Kong, arrived at noon yesterday, temporarily docking at the company's wharf in Pudong. It is scheduled to sail to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession this morning for unloading. (Zu)

Arrivals of thick, thin japonica, and other types of national rice remain scarce and sales have been sluggish. Hearing that black market prices for foreign rice continue to rise, sentiment is good, and trade is quite active. Sellers have abnormally raised prices, and all selling prices have broken out of the limited price range. Privately quoted prices: common japonica 133 yuan, Kunshan japonica 128-129 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice 122 yuan. Glutinous rice is very popular and follows the surge, with Hong Kong white rice selling for 118-119 yuan, and glutinous sprouts 114-115 yuan. All prices are 3-4 yuan higher than the week before.

### Flour Market in the Midst of Brewing

Flour: Yesterday's flour market was calm as usual, because the trading of the Grains Public Association has not yet returned to normal. The authorities are monitoring very closely, and speculators have disappeared. Foreign flour is also restricted by the Grains Public Association, so formal trading is still suspended. It is said that those who directly distribute to customers outside the Association have slightly different selling prices, because large merchants holding onto goods refuse to release them unless prices rise, while some retail investors, limited by capital, secretly seek to sell. The current market prices: Australian flour (Flower Bird Clock Tower brand) 30.05-30.30 yuan, Kan flour (Golden Dragon brand) 29.875-29.875 yuan. The market is still in the midst of brewing.

Wheat: Trading is even more desolate, because the source of inland durum wheat can be said to be almost nonexistent. The market trading has long been virtually suspended. It is said that Japanese factories' retail sales are extremely small, with the price still at 45-46 yuan.

### Oilcake: Soybean Cake Reaches New High Price

Since the price of oilcake in the grains market has been limited, the market turned active yesterday, because there are various types of goods and different qualities, and the market is not organized on a daily basis. Therefore, there are difficulties enforcing the limited price, so the general situation has loosened, and the market has become lively. Soybean cake trading is particularly fierce, and the price has risen in a semi-public situation, reaching a new high for the month. Over 4,000 pieces of Cheng Kee soybean cake were traded, with the price rising from 17.40 yuan to 18 yuan. Futures trading of 6,000 pieces: late April delivery 18.10-18.20 yuan, early May delivery 18.25-18.55 yuan. Yuan Long cake and Fei Zi cake for early May delivery were priced at 18.40 yuan, with 25 cartloads traded. 1,000 pieces of Chang Kee cake were priced at 18.05 yuan, and delivery was for late April. The current price of Huo Yuan Kee cake was 17.30 yuan, and early May delivery was 18.10 yuan, with 3,000 pieces traded. 2,000 pieces of Li Zi cake were traded at a price of 17.50-17.55 yuan. Actual sales accounted for one-third, with the remainder being traders, speculators, and "kicking the ball" customers. Today, 250 bags of soybeans were shipped to Xiamen, 845 bags to Hong Kong, along with 140 bags of sesame and 1,000 cans of sesame oil.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Falls and Then Jumps; Evening Price Reaches the 500 Yuan Mark Again

The yarn market continued to be weak due to the fierce fighting in eastern Zhejiang, causing the market to be slightly uncertain. At the same time, short sellers were active, and the market was depressed. However, the price of 20s Double Horse yarn was still strong. At the end of last week, Annam purchased 1,600 bales at a price of 1,430 yuan. Today, Hong Kong merchants bought 1,000 bales at a price of 1,410 yuan. These spot goods were immediately shipped out of the country, so there were many who were optimistic. The high price for 20s Double Horse was 1,500 yuan, and the low price was 1,477 yuan. The initial trade in the afternoon was at 1,488 yuan, rising to 1,491 yuan. Some short sellers then came to sell, returning to 1,487.5 yuan. After 3 o'clock, hearing that gold had soared, the yarn market followed, rising to 1,515 yuan. The final price was 1,514 yuan, and trading was quite active. Today, 395 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 250 pieces to Luoluo, and 30 pieces to Yantai.

Double Horse opened in the morning, and the market was amicable, but most were bearish due to the unfavorable situation in Ningbo and Shaoxing. The opening price was 1,499 yuan. Subsequently, influenced by more sellers and fewer buyers, the market weakened, and the market price gradually declined to 1,477 yuan. However, spot sales of Double Horse were still strong, and those covering short positions came one after another. New bulls were slightly active, and at the same time, spot gold stabilized, gradually rising to 1,492 yuan. The price was slightly flat, at 1,487 yuan. A statistical analysis of transactions in the first half of the day was 9,955 bales. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed separately below. Hong Kong: 1,155 bales; Annam: 1,600 bales; Peer Groups: 6,200 bales; Total: 9,955 bales.

### Cotton Market Slightly Quiet

The spot cotton situation is slightly flat, and the volume is not as active as in previous days. This is because the yarn market has rebounded and the foreign exchange market has stabilized, so sentiment has stabilized. Factories have not had much trading, and trading companies have only slightly adjusted some of the rental lint, while the rest is in a quiet state. However, the general sentiment is still optimistic about the future. Yesterday, 805 pieces of cotton came from Hong Kong, and a total of 2,600 pieces and 200 bales were traded, with prices rising by 1-2 yuan. A further breakdown is listed below.

Egyptian Cotton: 490 pieces (Shen Xin - all pieces)

Middling: 42 pieces (Hong Zhang - 100 pieces)

Indian NT: 375 pieces (Tong Yi - 300 pieces)

Rangoon Flower: 35 pieces (Xie Xin - 200 pieces)

Rangoon Flower: 36 pieces (Tai Xing - 200 pieces)

Rangoon Flower: 36 pieces (Xie Tong Xing - 200 pieces)

Rangoon Flower: 36.5 pieces (Xie Tong Xing - 200 pieces)

Rangoon Flower: 37 pieces (Xie Tong Xing - 400 pieces)

Another report says that foreign cotton trading by foreign firms seemed to be slightly suppressed due to the deteriorating situation in eastern Zhejiang and rumors of Ningbo being lost, but the base of the cotton market is still very firm, and the situation is calm and people are not afraid. Yesterday, there were still many trades between industry peers and factories, and Shen Xin even purchased 1,000 bales of long-staple Egyptian cotton, with the selling price approaching around 490 yuan.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to liquidations from all parties and political news from Washington that US President Roosevelt opposed increasing aid loans to farmers, but subsequently rose slightly due to short covering. As a result, closing prices fell 4-5 points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to large liquidations from all parties, but subsequently rose slightly due to buying support. Closing prices fell by about 2 points each.

It is also predicted that the market will open higher by 1.5 rupees today.

Bombay Telegraph: Statistics of Indian cotton from September 1, last year to April 19 this year are recorded below (per bale of 400 pounds):

### Securities: Bond Market Difficult to Rise

Due to the extremely serious situation in eastern Zhejiang, the bond market saw a surge in selling yesterday, and with the Four Banks still closed, short sellers took the opportunity to be very active, falling almost a yuan in the afternoon, and closing at a low price. The trend has not yet stabilized. Rumors persist that US economic and military aid have not yet been implemented, and it is feared that there will be no improvement in the short term. In the early morning opening, Heng Kang sold, and Tai and Sheng Xing bought along the way, with Class C rising from 5.25 yuan to 5.40 yuan. Afterwards, Xie Xing, Yuan Da, and Hua also sold, and the market returned to 5.15 yuan. The midday closing was slightly lower, at 5.3-5.4 yuan. In the afternoon, there were still many rumors. Sheng Dian also turned to sell, and Lian He, Xin Fu, Xin Hua, and Xie Xing all sold one after another. Although Yi Lian Yi, Xin Chang, and Yi Chang bought one after another, the number was not significant. The situation was still oversupply, and Class C opened at 5.10 yuan, immediately breaking below 5 yuan. Therefore, Class E also broke below 3 yuan, Class A broke below 4 yuan, and Class B also broke below 7 yuan. However, Class D has not yet opened. The result of supply and demand was a sharp drop across the board, ranging from 1.05 yuan to 1.25 yuan. There may be a rebound today. The total transaction volume was approximately 250,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

The stock market traded 150 shares of Da Sheng No. 3 Factory at a price of 31 yuan each.

Public utilities: The stock market opened slightly weaker and then rebounded. The total transaction volume was not large. Rubber stocks were more active than before.

### Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Breaks the 100 Yuan Mark; Main Reason Is That Hoarders Are Releasing Goods

Although the stock of sugar in Shanghai is not thin, most of it is in the hands of hoarders, who stubbornly refuse to sell, leading to a scarcity of goods in the industry. Therefore, the recent sharp rise is the result of the above factors. The market rose even more fiercely yesterday, because the market was full of rumors favorable to the bulls. The Public Association's current price of Grade 24 coarse white sugar was 94.3-95.7 yuan. The initial price of the futures for the end of April was flat at 94.4, 94.2, and 93.8 yuan, then rose sharply to 94.1, 94.6, 94.7 yuan, and even to 95.3, 95.5, and 96.0, 96.5, 97.5, reaching 98 yuan. New trading for May 10th also started, initially at 95.2, 95.4, 95.5, 95.0, 94.8, 95.4, 95.5, 96.0, 96.5, 96.8, 96.9, 97.0, 97.5, 98.0, 98.5, 98.9 yuan, closing at nearly 100 yuan at a price of 99.5 yuan. Taikoo car white B mark was 102.5, 103.5, 104, 104.5 yuan; DY mark 94, 94.5, 96 yuan; HX mark (West Wharf) 93.5 to 95 yuan, (East Wharf) 93.5 yuan, all rising in the range of 4-5 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Not Affected by Actual Sales; Aftermarket Turns Higher

Factory cloth: Yesterday's market fell and then rebounded. The morning opening was due to the fierce fighting in eastern Zhejiang, and actual sales were affected. Customers and industry peers urgently sought to sell, and selling prices fell step by step. Small amounts of Fortune Fine Cloth sold at a minimum of 46 yuan, and Fortune Twill sold at 40.05 yuan, each falling by about one yuan compared to the previous day. Later, there was a sudden positive news, and the black market Double Horse rebounded sharply, so the cloth price rebounded, returning to the original level of the previous day. However, transactions were scarce. Coarse cloth and coarse twill remained firm, and the current price of coarse twill was still sought after. The street traded over 300 pieces of various cloth, and Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants traded over 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Over 2,000 bolts of bleached and dyed cloth from Yih Ho and other factories were traded for Siam and other countries.

East cloth: The morning market saw a particularly sharp fall, with the minimum price of 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth falling to 50.8-50.9 yuan. In the afternoon, due to Tianjin merchants and group customers searching to buy, the rebound was also healthy, rising to 51.65 yuan, a fall of 0.15 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. Four Gentlemen serge was around 1.555 yuan, with no significant change.

### Coal: Hoarders Release Goods at High Prices; Cooked Coal Prices Soften Slightly

Due to the lack of goods, the black market price of cooked coal rose to 400 yuan last week. However, recently, hoarders have released old inventory at high prices, and there have been transactions, so prices have softened. Yesterday, peer trading was at 380 yuan, and there were also transactions at 380 yuan, a drop of 20 yuan. Street shops were selling screened lumps at 440 yuan per ton, and general coal at 418 yuan, delivered to the Rong family, including commissions.

### Hardware: Ribbed Steel Bars Still Sought After

Ribbed Steel Bars: The price of ribbed steel bars has been rising continuously in recent days. It is reported that this is due to purchases by a certain organization, and also because the source of these goods has long been cut off. Those on the market are only the inventory in Shanghai, so those holding the goods have a firm mind and the price soars. Yesterday, the market price for 3/8 and 1/2 inch sizes was 3,600 yuan per ton, and the price for 5/8 inch to 1 inch sizes was 3,500 yuan per ton, a rise of 100 yuan compared to before.

### Grain: Rice Market's Black Market Price Rises; "Small Twist" Rice Premium Is 1,000 Yuan; Original Packages Already Reach 156 Yuan; The Chaotic Market Is Even More Unimaginable

Yesterday's rice market was smoky and chaotic, and the black market premium has been secretly publicized. Not only has the limited price long been broken, but it seems that premiums are rising higher and higher. The initial premium for "small twist" rice was 600-700 yuan, then 800-900 yuan, and finally 1,000 yuan per 100 bags.

### Continue to Vigorously Implement Electricity Restrictions: Overuse Charged at Six Times the Rate; Electricity Allocation Report Awaits Study; Hope All Types of Users Make Every Effort to Conserve

According to a statement by the Public Works Department, this bureau previously established a special committee to study the allocation of electricity, responsible for reviewing and recommending allocation methods. The committee has now completed its report, which will be considered by the new board of directors. Any severe measures restricting electricity supply will undoubtedly have a significant impact, especially on the industrial sector. Currently, industrial electricity consumption accounts for 72% of the Shanghai Power Company's power production. Therefore, the aforementioned report should be carefully considered to ensure prudence.

Coal Stockpile Dwindling Daily

According to a report from the Shanghai Power Company, the current electricity restriction measures, which allocate 70% of the standard electricity consumption to users consuming over 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month, and charge three times the rate for consumption exceeding this allocation, have not been effective in conserving electricity. Meanwhile, coal consumption far exceeds replenishment. On February 24th of this year, the company's coal stockpile was 150,700 tons, but by April 1st, it had decreased to approximately 120,000 tons.

Excess Allocation: Six Times the Rate

In light of the company's dwindling fuel reserves and the time required to consider the special committee's report, this bureau has approved the continued implementation of the aforementioned electricity restriction measures. However, the charge for consumption exceeding the approved allocation will be increased from three times to six times the average electricity price.

Increased Revenue Allocated to Reserve

It is solemnly declared that the company is not profiting from this. The increased revenue will be allocated to the fuel reserve fund for uses most beneficial to users, such as purchasing exceptionally expensive coal. If such coal can be obtained, it can allow industry to continue without burdening users who do not exceed their approved allocation with the full cost of this high-priced coal.

Still Hope All Sectors Find Ways to Conserve

Furthermore, attention should be paid to the serious fuel supply situation. It is earnestly hoped that all types of users will make every effort to conserve electricity. Otherwise, strict and compulsory restriction measures will be unavoidable.

Strict Restrictions to Achieve Results

Furthermore, the Shanghai Power Company believes that due to fuel scarcity, it is difficult to maintain the supply needed by all city users. Therefore, with the approval of the Public Works Department at the beginning of last month, it announced electricity conservation measures. However, since implementation, not only has the conservation been minimal and failed to meet expectations, but also efforts to dredge and clear ships to ensure fuel supply have been ineffective. The company's coal reserves, which originally stood at 150,000 tons last month, intended for emergency use, are now being depleted by 25,000 tons per month to cover consumption deficits, reducing the current reserves to 120,000 tons. This has made the company's fuel situation even more severe than when electricity reduction was previously implemented. The company's special committee for studying electricity conservation has researched further electricity restriction measures and submitted a proposal to the Public Works Department for review. Acknowledging the severity of the situation and seeking to implement measures as soon as possible, the department passed part of the proposal at last week's board meeting, deciding to implement it starting on the 24th of this month. At that time, users consuming more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours will be charged six times the electricity price to achieve strict restriction results.

Electricity Restriction: Newly Revised Measures

Yesterday at 10:30 AM, Mr. Hawkins, President of the Shanghai Power Company, held a reception for reporters at the company's headquarters on the sixth floor of Nanjing Road to announce the new electricity conservation measures. The text is as follows: "Previously, the Shanghai Public Works Department approved a tripling of charges for excess electricity consumption to restrict electricity use, aiming to conserve fuel during this emergency period. However, it has been found that this measure has failed to achieve its objective, and fuel consumption far exceeds its replenishment. Due to the urgent situation, and during the discussion of the Special Committee's recommendations, the Shanghai Public Works Department has approved the following measures, effective immediately, and repealing all previous announcements: (1) For all users with a monthly standard electricity consumption of 1,000 kilowatt-hours or more from January 1940 to January 1941, starting from the company's next meter reading date, they may only use 70% of their standard electricity consumption, charged at the prevailing electricity price. If this 70% electricity consumption is less than 1,000 kilowatt-hours, then 1,000 kilowatt-hours will be the minimum limit. (2) Electricity consumption exceeding the quota limit will be charged at six times the average electricity price. In other words, the electricity bill for electricity consumption exceeding the limit should be six times the average electricity price obtained by dividing the total electricity bill (calculated at the current price) by the total kilowatt-hours consumed. (3) For users with a monthly standard electricity consumption of 1,000 kilowatt-hours or less, if they exceed 1,000 kilowatt-hours in any month, the exceeding portion will be charged at six times the average electricity price charged for the first 1,000 kilowatt-hours. (4) The purpose of the increased electricity charges in the above (2) and (3) items is to restrict electricity use and conserve fuel. The company does not profit from this. All revenue, except that charged at the prevailing electricity price, will be allocated to the 'Fuel Conservation Reserve' to be used for purposes beneficial to users, as agreed upon by the Public Works Department and the company in the future. (5) Until further notice, the company will not accept any applications for large or ordinary (small) electricity supply, whether new installations or additions. (6) During this fuel emergency period, it is earnestly hoped that all users, large and small, will conserve electricity as much as possible."

### Sluggish Sales: Yarn Mills Reduce Production

The cotton yarn industry in this city once flourished after the war. However, since the incident on May 2nd of last year, market prices have been falling, causing severe damage to speculators. Although market prices have gradually shown improvement recently, actual sales are sluggish, leading to a surplus. Furthermore, the Shanghai Power Company believes that the overseas situation is very unfavorable, fearing problems with fuel sources. Therefore, yarn mills are planning to reduce production by 20%. Production will decrease, while actual sales remain sluggish.

### A Corner of Crowded Traffic on Nanjing Road

On the roads in the International Settlement, pedestrians are crowded and vehicle traffic is frequent, which municipal authorities often consider a difficult problem to solve. We only need to look at the busiest Nanjing Road, where the north side of the Daxin Company is a bus stop, and the south end is also a bus stop. Sometimes (as shown in the picture), a row of trams, cars, or buses come one after another, like a train with a dozen cars. Pedestrians who want to cross the road often wait impatiently.

### Eastern Zhejiang: Chinese Troops Gather; Japanese Army Heavily Defeated in Shaoxing; Ningbo Bombed with Few Casualties; No Response to Telegram Inquiry

According to yesterday's news from Eastern Zhejiang, the Japanese troops who invaded Shaoxing have suffered heavy attacks from the Chinese side and are showing signs of retreat. Unofficial sources claim that the Chinese army has recaptured Shaoxing, but confirmation is pending. The situation in Ningbo is also very chaotic at present. It is said that the Japanese aircraft bombings in Ningbo caused substantial material damage, but most people had evacuated to the countryside, resulting in few deaths. According to the person in charge of the Ningbo Association, the association sent telegrams to Ningbo on the morning of the 19th (i.e., the 19th), but has not received a response to date. This suggests that the situation there is even more serious.

Chaos in Ningbo; Street Battles in Wenzhou

According to inquiries made last night by the Dakong News Agency's reporter to the Shanghai Zhejiang community about the Zhejiang situation: (1) Since the Japanese army forcibly landed at Wanghai Mountain, Jinji Mountain, and other places east of Zhenhai on the morning of the 19th, the local garrison immediately counterattacked. The Japanese army reinforced its troops under the cover of artillery fire and broke into Ningbo. (2) The Japanese troops who landed at Haimen suffered setbacks in their attack by the Chinese army and have sent warships to reinforce 2,000 soldiers to continue their assault on Huangyan. (3) The Japanese troops who landed in Ruian and Banpu launched fierce street battles in Wenzhou on the afternoon of the 19th. (4) Haimen, Linhai, Zhuji, and other places have also fallen.

People in Wenzhou and Ningbo Relatively Calm

According to inquiries made separately by the Datong News Agency's reporter to the Shanghai Zhejiang community: (1) Since the Japanese warships forcibly landed troops at Shipai in the south of Xiangshan County, Haimen above Huangyan, Ruian north of Wenzhou, and Zhenhai on the coast of Eastern Zhejiang, the local garrisons have separately launched counterattacks and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. (2) The Japanese troops who attacked from the south of Sanjiang City entered Shaoxing on the 17th and continued to attack Liugongbu in the southwest that evening. Fighting is still ongoing. (3) The Shanghai community telegraphed Ningbo and Wenzhou yesterday to inquire about details, but have not yet received a reply. According to private telegrams, the local situation has become chaotic. Organizations and groups are working in the countryside, and residents are evacuating to the suburbs. However, because Zhenhai once fell last year, the residents have been through alarms and disturbances and the people are relatively calm.

Telecommunications Interrupted; Parcel Post Temporarily Suspended

The American news agencies and Great Northern, Pacific and other telegraphic agencies in this port have suspended telegrams to Ningbo, Zhenhai, Haimen, Yongjia (Wenzhou) and other places from yesterday. However, Jin Hua and other places are still open. The Shanghai Postal Administration has decided to temporarily suspend the collection of bulk and small parcel post to Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangxi provinces and cities from today. The Parcel Post Sealing and Dispatching Group of the Bureau has issued an announcement that says, "Due to transportation difficulties, all bulk and small parcel post items destined for Fujian and Jiangxi, and those transiting through these locations, will be temporarily suspended for collection from the 22nd of this month. In addition, the collection of bulk and small parcel post to various places in Eastern Zhejiang will also be temporarily suspended from that day. Ordinary registered express mail and postcards from Shanghai to the above-mentioned places are still being collected and the postal orders are still being issued as usual and there should be no disruption later."

Important Highways Completely Destroyed

According to those familiar with the situation in Eastern Zhejiang who told Dakong News Agency reporters, after the Japanese announced the blockade of the coast, Eastern Zhejiang lost its economic value long ago, and according to the current war situation, it has no military value. Moreover, in addition to the coastal area of Zhejiang Province, the Siming, Kuocang, Tiantai and other mountains meander, the terrain is high and dangerous, and the Chinese army has already completely destroyed all the important highways, so it is difficult for the Japanese army to peer deeper to achieve its goal.

### Labor Day: City's Workers Intensify Production; Employers Should Also Voluntarily Raise Wages

International Labor Day on May 1st is approaching rapidly. The Shanghai labor community will take a day off on that day to celebrate, but because it is an extraordinary time, no gatherings will be held, and the celebration will avoid extravagance. In order to promote the significance of Labor Day, all the workers in the city have decided to work hard at their posts and, in the spirit of labor-management cooperation, step up production. At the same time, employers in various industries, in this autumn of abnormal prices and difficult lives for workers, should also voluntarily improve the treatment of workers as much as possible within their means to alleviate the suffering of workers' lives. On that day, the authorities of the two settlements also decided to implement strict precautions to prevent unscrupulous elements from engaging in misconduct and to maintain public safety.

### The Public Works Department's Provisional Board of Directors: Difficult to Achieve Immediately; Awaiting Decision from the National Government in Chongqing

Although the Public Works Department's provisional board of directors was approved by the special meeting of Nazis some days ago, it is still awaiting the decision of the National Government in Chongqing yesterday. What is Chongqing's attitude? It is impossible to know for the moment. According to well-informed sources, all parties concerned have agreed to the so-called provisional board of directors of international goodwill and cooperation. At present, the final decision is up to Chongqing's attitude. It is said that the relevant parties are now conducting negotiations with Chongqing, and it is expected that the National Government will issue an announcement soon.

Still Not Approved by Various Countries

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" says that although the provisional board of directors of the Public Works Department has been approved by a vote at the previous special meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession, the council is still in its infancy today (the 21st) because it is awaiting approval from the countries concerned and the Chinese government. It is not possible to inquire from the officialdom when the provisional board of directors can start working, and it is also not known for sure whether this change of the Public Works Department will await the approval of the Chongqing central government. It is said that the countries concerned are expected to instruct their consuls in Shanghai to convey their replies within a few days. As for the nature of the reply, it cannot be predicted. The date is May 11.

### The YMCA Advocates the "Parents' Day": Date is May 11

In recent years, Chinese society has gradually paid more attention to women, children, parents, etc., such as holding Women's Day and Children's Day, which are significant expressions. Now, the Chinese YMCA, in view of the importance of parents' status, has launched the Chinese Parents' Day to be held every second Sunday in May (this year is May 11), with the aim of promoting filial piety, increasing parents' welfare, and promoting parents' education. Moreover, Christian schools and church organizations in various parts of China, in imitation of the American custom, have held Mother's Day on the second Sunday of May every year. However, the YMCA believes that this approach emphasizes motherhood and neglects fatherhood, which is contrary to the country's culture and traditional habits. It has issued circulars to relevant parties that the Parents' Day should be held from 1941 to replace the former Mother's Day. The association recently elected Chen Zhengfan, Guan Cuizhen, and others who originally proposed Parents' Day to be responsible for drafting the "Purpose and Methods of Holding Parents' Day." The following is an excerpt of the methods of holding it on a personal level: (1) Wear flowers to express love and remembrance to parents. Wear red flowers if parents are alive; wear white flowers if parents have passed away; wear blue flowers if the father or mother has passed away. (2) Present gifts to parents. (3) Hold a banquet for parents to celebrate their health. (4) Invite parents to participate in entertainment occasions to increase their happiness. (5) Present flowers to ailing parents to express greetings. (6) Send letters to parents in faraway places to ask about their well-being. (7) If parents have passed away, offer fresh flowers on their graves to express deep mourning. (8) If parents have passed away, and siblings have already separated, they should live together for one day to recall the past and express their remembrance of their parents. (9) Provide relief to impoverished and helpless parents. (10) Assist parents who are in difficulty.

### Rotary Club to Hold Annual Meeting This Week: No Foreign Guests Invited

### Li Dingmo Shot Dead in the Zhongnan Hotel Yesterday: Shot Dead While Walking Up the Escalator; Assailant Arrested While Trying to Escape, Shot in the Buttocks

In the Zhongnan Hotel on Aiduya Road near Dongxin Bridge, a shooting occurred suddenly at about 4:45 PM yesterday. The victim, Li Dingmo, worked in the banking industry. The assailant was alone and was apprehended while trying to escape at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Fujian Road. The following is an investigation of the situation:

Bullet Pierced Chest and Back, Instant Death

At about 4:15 PM yesterday, a customer wearing a silk gown and yellow leather shoes entered the Zhongnan Hotel at 560 Aiduya Road and went upstairs via the stairs. When he reached the turning point on the first floor, several people followed him from behind without asking why. He was suddenly shot at with a box cannon. At that time, the man was unable to dodge in a hurry and was hit in the back, piercing through his chest, and fell to the ground in response. Because the injury was to a key area, he died instantly.

Rushing to Escape; Indian Police Pursued Closely

At the time of the incident, the hotel was full of customers, who were busy going back and forth. When the gunshot suddenly sounded, the passengers ran for shelter. When the assassin saw that the goal had been achieved, he mingled with the crowd and ran out the door to escape. An Indian policeman was patrolling and saw the assassin running away in big steps. Knowing that he was not a good person, he chased him from behind while blowing the police whistle, following closely. When he fled to Hubei Road and turned into Guangdong Road, the Indian fired three shots but none of them hit.

Grabbing the Assassin; and Firing

At that time, the assassin held a gun and fired a shot to resist arrest. Because the bullet was stuck, he could not fire. Before long, when he crossed to the front of the Zheng Yu Xiang cigarette and paper shop at No. 89, the intersection of Guangdong Road and Fujian Road, Huabu No. 454 of the Chengdu Road Police Station was passing by the scene, witnessed everything, and bravely stepped forward, hugged him around the waist and pushed him to the ground. The Indian policeman who followed him then caught up and fired a shot, one hitting his right thumb and one shooting his buttocks. The gun he was holding was obtained by the Huabu.

Named Li Dingmo; Employed in the Bank

When the ambulance was called, the injured criminal was sent to the police hospital for treatment. According to the confession, his name is He Fengxiang, 23 years old, wearing a black striped serge gown. As for the body, the Zhongnan accountant reported it to the Old Zha Police Station, and it was sent to Renji Hospital by the hearse for examination at the mortuary. It is reported that the deceased's name is Li Dingmo, 41 years old, from Jiangyin, and works in the banking sector.

### Rice Prices Soar Again Yesterday: Speculation Pushes Operating Rice Prices Higher; Rectifying the Rice Market Can No Longer Be Delayed

Yesterday, the rice market was chaotic under the manipulation of speculators. Absurd rumors emerged one after another, causing the price per picul to soar by three or four yuan compared to last week. After the illegal elements traded privately in the afternoon, the price was raised by one or so yuan, resulting in a sharp increase of four or five yuan in one day yesterday.

Disregarding Price Limits

It was found that last week, the authorities issued an order that Saigon rice should not exceed 124 yuan per picul, but yesterday the black market price reached 132 or 3 yuan, exceeding the limit by 8 or 9 yuan. The authorities' price limit order is still prominently displayed in the market, but the general rice worms turn a blind eye. The food problem is becoming more and more serious. If urgent and strict measures are not taken immediately, it will have a great impact on the security of the wood market. It is hoped that the authorities and the relevant aspects will pay close attention to it. According to a message from a rice shop, the shop received a notification from Saigon counterparts yesterday, saying that "new goods are on the market, harvesting is abundant, ordering has begun, and there is no need to worry about being blocked in the future." It can be seen that the rice market is rumored to be inaccurate.

Speculating and Operating

According to the investigation, the city's rice reserves are over one million bags, and the reserves in Japanese rice warehouses and rice shops and factories are more than 700,000 bags, which is enough for half a year. Most of these rice are one or two months of imported goods, with very low costs. If they are sold at the official price limit, the profit will be very considerable, but it is still not enough to satisfy their desires, and they are repeatedly raising the price, causing the current serious situation. And in terms of sources, there are 20,000 to 30,000 bags arriving in Shanghai every day. At present, what should be implemented urgently is (1) prohibiting non-rice shops from searching for spot goods in the market, because the current transaction in the rice market is mostly speculative, and prices are raised as a result (2) shortening business hours, because if business hours are long, the rumors spread by these people can play a great role in the market, and it is especially necessary to immediately and effectively prohibit private trading in the miscellaneous grain market in the afternoon.

### Psychologist Bin Comes to Shanghai to Perform, Predicting the End of the Sino-Japanese War

Dutch psychologist Sylvain Boekedinber, one of the world's four most famous psychologists, will soon perform psychic magic at 94 Jing'an Temple Road, such as clairvoyance, plum blossom divination, overnight divination, telepathy, and blind driving, and can also perform all kinds of amazing performances on the spirit and soul. Mr. Boekedinber is willing to perform all kinds of magical techniques free of charge at press banquets or other grand banquet seats. Mr. Boekedinber comes from

Java to Shanghai

and is as famous as the European and German psychic Eric Jan Hanussen and the Viennese psychic Ranael Shermann. Mr. Hanussen was killed by Hitler's men in Germany because he knew the past, future, and the psychology of the masses, and Mr. Shermann's whereabouts are also unknown.

The Future Outcome of the European War

is something that politicians do not want prophets to announce. Mr. Boekedinber claims to be born knowing, but some say that he is proficient in psychology and that he can make scientific judgments and decisions on all mental expressions of human behavior and actions. Chinese electrical engineer Fan Fengyuan has recently studied

Animal Magnetism

and the famous Japanese psychic Akisue Myeongdeung (Ienicho Auivama) both believe that the human body itself has a kind of magnetism for the spirit and soul, and this kind of magnetism can have strong expressions for men and women, or during sleep, dreams, or fear, and that each person's sleep every night is a way to restore the inherent state of human magnetism, so sleep can alleviate the condition, and by

Psychological Effects

it is possible to reduce mental illness or other diseases, and by the three powers of the mind, one is understanding (Under Standing), the second is reasoning (Reasoning), and the third is imagination (Imagination,) gathering them together, one can guess all the future good and bad, but ordinary people often do not use "understanding" and "reasoning" to help "imagination" when guessing future events,

Side by Side, Abandoned Driving

therefore, the results of guessing are often not very accurate. Mr. Boekedinber said that the Sino-Japanese War is about to end, and that the Chinese people's unity and national belief are that Chairman Jiang is the highest aspiration, and that this psychological power of the masses is enough to cope with everything.

### The Four Banks and the Police Department Negotiate Security Issues: Dismissal of Bank of China Employees Said to Be Inaccurate

According to well-informed sources yesterday, the four banks of Zhongzhong Jiaonong will resume operations soon, but the exact date has not yet been announced. As for the rumor that 70 employees of the Bank of China resigned, employees of the bank said that this rumor is not based on facts. It is said that even if a few employees resign, it is not a special circumstance, because the entry and exit of bank employees is a very normal thing. It is also said that the bank is currently negotiating protection issues with the police authorities. Once this negotiation is completed, the four banks will resume operations.

Ministry of Finance Instructs to Resume Operations as Soon as Possible

Reuters Chongqing, 21st: Xu Kan of the Ministry of Finance said that the Ministry of Finance has instructed the four banks in Shanghai to resume operations as soon as possible, and the government authorities have prepared methods to protect the employees of the four banks. Mr. Xu also pointed out the importance of economic warfare in the war in China and that the government's banks decided to operate in Shanghai until the absolute impossibility. He also said that the government's attitude toward the Shanghai banks will depend on the subsequent developments.

### HSBC Annual Meeting Report: The General Trend of Commerce and Finance in the Far East

The Chinese Government's Maintenance of Currency Integrity is a Remarkable Achievement; Various Countries' Loans and Economic Aid to China are Quite Satisfactory

The British HSBC Bank held its annual meeting in Hong Kong on February 26, 1941. Chairman Hon. lr. J.I. Paterson reported on the bank's business in 1940 and the general trend of commerce and finance in the Far East. The following is an excerpt of the original text obtained by the reporter of the New Voice News Agency:

Shanghai-Hong Kong Business: Continued Progress

The development of the Far Eastern situation coincides with the predictions of prudent observers two or three years ago. Obstacles have arisen, and business has been greatly affected. However, optimists can certainly claim that business has not been as bad as the political developments predicted. Pessimists and optimists each have their reasons. If you recall the speeches of previous chairmen, you will be surprised by the frequent use of gloomy phrases such as "unprecedented difficulties," "reversing the situation," "extraordinary state," and "uncertain future." However, if you have several years of experience living in the Far East, and you compare the current business and shipping in Hong Kong and Shanghai with the situation twenty or thirty years ago, you will find that both Hong Kong and Shanghai are still able to maintain a trend of continued progress.

Emergency Aid to China: Quite Satisfactory

The only unhealthy thing is most obvious, that is, last year, Shanghai imported a large number of native products, most of which can be supplied in normal times, such as rice, cotton, coal, tobacco, sugar, flour, and rayon. The total quantity and value of these imports have greatly increased compared to 1936. In that year, the total value of these imports accounted for only 13% of the total imports, but in 1940, it increased to 51%. On the export side, it was also affected by foreign forces, resulting in serious consequences for the trade balance. However, China continues to receive various loans from foreign countries to meet the needs of currency security and currency management measures, which is quite satisfactory.

Maintaining Currency Integrity: A Remarkable Achievement

Last year, the Shanghai foreign exchange market's highest rate in January was 4 and 32/29 pence for British gold and 8 and 1/16 for US dollars. The lowest in May was 3 pence and 4 and 32/31. The city fluctuated between these two numbers. The exchange rate at the end of the year was 3 and 1/1 pence and 5 and 2/1 US dollars. The balance exchange fund continued to perform balancing work when necessary. Looking at the export trade in non-occupied areas and occupied areas, most of it is under control, it can be called a miracle that the national currency price can be maintained with few difficulties.

Repaying Foreign Debt According to Legal Rates

China's customs revenue is often praised by those who have not carefully studied the actual situation. Although the figure reached 47.5 million legal currency, it is only worth 7.75 million pounds based on the average exchange rate of the year. In contrast, the previous year's income was only 33.1 million legal currency, which is equal to 8.25 million pounds. However, in the ten years before the Sino-Japanese War, the annual average was no less than 19 million pounds. In addition, due to the continuation of the Sino-Japanese War, the foreign debt market conditions last year could not improve. For the customs surplus and salt surplus loans, the National Government has ordered the Central Bank to repay them at the stipulated exchange rate. The funds allocated for repaying foreign debts are calculated at the initial legal exchange rate of one shilling and two and a quarter pence.

Mr. Maze Supervises Customs

According to the estimate of the previous chairman, the customs surplus deposit of the Yokohama Specie Bank reached 380 million yuan. At present, the figure should have doubled. If the Yokohama Specie Bank releases the exchange rate stipulated by the Chinese government, this is indeed a problem of exchange, that is, how to obtain the required foreign exchange. In any case, the foreign debts issued before the incident cannot be denied. Therefore, this exchange problem cannot be solved by either China or the customs surplus authorities in the occupied areas. It can only be hoped that the world will return to normal. What the bondholders belong to is that Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, continues to supervise the customs administration. Fortunately, the achievements are remarkable, and there is no doubt that there will be more achievements in the future when peace is restored.

Restoring Normal Times to Recover Debts

Among China's various railway loans, the Beining Railway (i.e., the 1899 Jingfeng Railway Gold Public Debt) is still able to repay on time, and the operating income is quite good. The Northeast authorities have difficulty obtaining remittances. Although British employees are paid as usual, they are undoubtedly treated poorly and therefore very dissatisfied. The progress in western China is the initial construction of the Kunming-Northwest Railway, but due to the isolation of the Yunnan-Vietnam transportation, this only route for transporting heavy materials has been interrupted. The Xiang-Gui Railway in Hengyang and the western section of the Longhai Line are under construction. The railways under the jurisdiction of Japanese companies are the Central China Company in the Jiangnan area and the North China Company in the Hebei area. It seems that traffic is normal and there is some income. However, bondholders will probably not be able to recover their debts until the political situation returns to normal.

We Hope to Maintain Order

Since the mainland restricted the transportation of the main food and other native products of the Chinese people to Shanghai, this is a negative factor for the decline in foreign exchange, which suddenly raised the living standard by 50% compared to January 1940. The price of rice increased by 120%, and compared to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, it increased sharply by 600%. Therefore, naturally, the cost of all goods has increased, and expenditures must also increase, putting the finances of the Public Works Department in a difficult situation. I am afraid that the fundamental solution to the Shanghai problem can only be achieved when the political problems in the Far East are resolved. What we hope for at present is only that all humanitarians maintain peace and order to protect the lives and safety of the citizens of Shanghai.

### Shooting at Ewo Cotton Mill: Many Workers Injured

At the Ewo Cotton Mill in Yangshupu, a strike occurred because the coolie workers demanded a pay raise from manager Davis, which was not granted, resulting in a shooting incident by the police. On the day the incident occurred, the workers went to work as usual in the early morning and were immediately driven away and beaten by the police. The workers immediately seized the iron rods in their hands and fought back, causing a British policeman to have several teeth knocked out. The policeman was furious and summoned more than 200 policemen to surround the factory. Seeing the impending disaster, the workers begged for release but were still shot. For a time, there was a loud commotion, and more than 20 workers were slightly injured. The seriously injured were sent to the police hospital. The coolie workers did not hold iron rods in a group to fight, nor did they coerce other workers to strike. They are now appealing to all sectors of society to uphold justice and provide assistance.

### Ms. Wu Leyi: Piano Recital

Ms. Wu Leyi, a famous Chinese piano expert (pictured), excelled in music from a young age. At the age of seven, she had already performed for the public and was admired by society. Since 1936, in addition to personal piano recitals, she has often performed famous piano pieces with the Shanghai Municipal Council String Orchestra and is well-known. Ms. Wu has decided to hold a personal piano recital at the Lyceum Theatre at 9:15 pm on Friday, April 25. The proceeds from the tickets, after deducting expenses, will be donated to charity. It is said that those who buy tickets and reserve seats are very enthusiastic. People from all walks of life who wish to buy tickets and reserve seats can contact the Lyceum Theatre or Moutrie's Music Store on Nanjing Road.

### Hand Grenade Injures Four Children Inside the Cilian Women and Children's Shelter

The shelter houses about 1,250 women and children, and Wei Huahai is the director. At 10 am yesterday, seven boys from the shelter were playing in the open space inside the shelter when suddenly something resembling a hand grenade exploded with a deafening noise. Four children were injured on the spot. The injured include Tang Jinxiu (14 years old), a boy from Anhui, injured in the face; Chuan Liangfa (11 years old), a boy from Guangdong, injured in the buttocks; Dai Xuesheng (9 years old), a boy from Anhui, injured in the left foot; and He Guocheng (11 years old), a local boy, injured in the head and feet. Afterwards, they were rushed to the refugee hospital for treatment. The Public Concession Police Station was informed and immediately sent personnel to investigate. After investigation, it was found that the injury was caused by a bomb. It is likely that the children in the shelter picked it up outside and did not recognize it as a dangerous item, which led to the disaster.

### US Marine Corps Soldier Commits Suicide with a Letter

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that Private E. M. Ya of the 4th US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai died of a rifle wound in the barracks last Saturday night. A note was found next to him, which is believed to be a suicide note. The US Marine Corps is currently investigating the cause. It is believed that Mr. Ya recently received a letter stating that his relatives living in Hungary have been experiencing difficulties in recent months. In addition, Mr. Ya was in poor health and suddenly had the idea of ​​being tired of the world. It is reported that Mr. Ya was 25 years old and originally from Chicago. He can speak several languages ​​such as Hungarian, Russian, Italian, German, and French.

### Wu Guanhua Returns Home the Same Night After Being Kidnapped

The Shanghai Times reported that Wu Guanhua, a compradore of the Huatai Shipping Company at No. 111 Sichuan Road in the city, who lived at No. 1 Youning Village, Talas Road, was visited by three men, all of whom appeared to be armed, at 11 am yesterday (20th). After talking with Wu for three hours, they took Wu out of the house and drove away in a taxi. Wu's wife did not know the three men and suspected that her husband had been kidnapped. She immediately reported the case to the French Police Station for investigation. It was learned that at about 8 pm, Mr. Wu returned home safely. The whole family was overjoyed.

### Guangdong Province is Determined to Promote National Education: Registration of Primary School Teachers is Held, totaling 11,490 people.

(Qujiang Correspondence) Guangdong Province is determined to promote national education, and there is an urgent need for teachers. Among them, more than 6,000 central schools and national schools have been added, and a total of 18,076 teachers need to be supplemented. In addition to holding 200 national education teacher training classes last year, more than 7,900 teachers have been trained. A provincial primary school teacher registration was also held. As of the end of February this year, 58 counties including Nanhai participated in the registration. There are 16,832 registered primary school teachers, 10,082 incumbents, and 4,030 non-incumbents. Qualified teachers account for 10,083, and 650 teachers have passed the qualification examination. There are a total of 11,490 qualified teachers. In order to enable the above-mentioned trained and registered qualified teachers to serve and meet the needs of establishing rural security schools, the Education Department has ordered counties and cities to conduct on-the-job and unemployed teacher surveys to promote national education and serve as the basis for security and appointment. At the same time, according to the provincial normal education plan, 3,805 teachers should be added this year. This fall, the provincial normal school should graduate 21 classes, with 429 graduating students, and the county normal school will graduate 475 students. This year, 12 classes of county junior high schools have been approved to add teacher training courses. By autumn, there will be 360 substitute teachers. A total of 1,260 teachers can be supplemented, which is still 2,541 teachers short of the original plan. In order to actively supplement, it has been decided to strengthen the training methods: (1) Increase the number of provincial normal school classes. There are currently 73 normal school classes in the province with 2,194 students. It is planned to add 8 classes this fall, for a total of 81 classes, and enroll 400 more normal school students.

### How to Study Physics (II)

— Xu Ziwei

(3) Pay attention to after-class review "Daily study will not be forgotten", "Review the old and know the new" are ancient lessons. If the knowledge we have learned in class is not reviewed at any time after class, it will inevitably become unfamiliar. And physics is a science with continuity. If the things learned before are wasted day by day, when you learn the places where there is contact later, it is undoubtedly going to be difficult to understand. Moreover, since physics is a very difficult subject to understand, the knowledge gained in class may not be completely without doubts and incomprehensibility. If it is not after a review after class, it will be impossible to know what is understood and what is not yet clear, then you need to ask. Many honest people often feel that physics becomes more and more difficult to read. In fact, this is not entirely true. Most of it is due to the lack of review, which makes the previous ones not proficient, and thus this effect occurs.

(4) Develop the habit of asking questions Learning and asking questions go hand in hand. "Asking good questions will lead to wealth" and "Not being ashamed to ask questions" are ancient lessons to encourage learning and asking questions. Since physics is very difficult to understand, even if we can listen attentively in class and refer widely after class, there will inevitably be many difficulties and uncertainties. To solve these problems, the only way is to ask questions, either to ask teachers or to learn from each other with classmates. You must ask for details without being impatient, and strive to achieve a thorough understanding. If you do not ask questions, the teacher does not know where the reader does not understand, and the reader cannot solve what he does not understand. Therefore, when studying physics, you should ask questions immediately when you encounter difficulties and uncertainties. Do not be afraid to ask questions, do not be impatient to ask questions, and develop the habit of asking questions.

(5) Detailed explanation of the practice questions Practice questions are necessary to assist learning, increase the degree of understanding, and inspire and train thinking. Many physics problems seem difficult and incomprehensible at first glance, but if you think about them, you can solve them easily. Therefore, when practicing physics problems, you must think and consider in many ways. You should not ask questions immediately if you feel you do not understand something. Drawing a diagram can make the content of the problem clear and guide thinking to a clear analytical path. Therefore, it is best to draw a simple diagram first to help you think when explaining some physics problems. If you encounter a problem that is extremely difficult to solve, it is best to flip through reference books first, always focusing on automatic solving. As for the convenience of reading, the explanation should be detailed, the calculation should be accurate, and the writing should be clear. There is no need to say this.

### Longevity

— Xiao Yun

Clinging to life and fearing death is perhaps an inherent human trait. The ancient dictator Qin Shi Huang's quest for the elixir of immortality can be said to represent humanity's desire for life. It is said that the modern dictator Mussolini was also very afraid of aging. He disliked people mentioning his birthday and forbade newspapers from publishing news of his grandson's birth, and he often performed horseback riding and jumping to show that he was not old. If these rumors are true, then it is probably a case of "great minds think alike."

Recently, Dr. D. W. Malisoff of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in the United States announced that human lifespan has the potential to increase to one hundred and eighty-five years. He is currently experimenting with a chemical called Sodium thioeyate to feed rabbits, and it is said that it can already overcome the signs of aging in rabbits because this chemical has the function of breaking down cholesterol in the rabbits' bodies. According to him, cholesterol is a waxy substance in human blood vessels, and the older a person is, the more cholesterol they have in their blood vessels. If we can break down cholesterol in the human body, human lifespan may be extended.

At a time when most of the globe is covered in the flames of war, when most countries are mired in a state of war, when militaristic aggressors are doing their best to shorten the lives of most young people with artillery and bombs, scientists are diligently engaged in research to extend human life. What a deeply ironic picture!

Although the world is shrouded in gloom, the dawn of scientific progress is constantly and secretly strengthening. It's just that humans must learn from historical lessons, must make good use of science, and must also make good use of their lifespan.

### Dr. Banting is Dead

— Mo Ming

On February 21, 1941, a scientific giant fell along with a wrecked giant plane near Mouse Grave Port on the east coast of Newfoundland. This giant was the famous Dr. F. G. Banting—the medical scientist who discovered insulin, the re-parents of diabetics worldwide, a true benefactor of humanity.

His tragic news shocked every corner of the world, causing millions of diabetic sufferers to cover their faces and weep. Twenty years ago, Dr. Banting buried himself in hard work at the graduate school of the University of Toronto in Canada, wanting to extract an endocrine hormone essential for consuming blood sugar—insulin—from the "Islets of Langerhans" in the animal pancreas. After countless resolute failures, his painstaking efforts finally achieved unprecedented success. In 1922, the insulin prepared by Dr. Banting was first formally tested on a dying child, and thus the first diabetic patient in human history was saved by human power. Banting's name shook the world like his tragic news today; doctors praised, patients rejoiced. His immortal achievements quickly gained the highest evaluation and respect—he and his teacher Professor J. J. R. Macleod shared the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Dr. Banting was an outstanding surgeon, but he had a deeper love for basic medicine in all departments. His thirst for knowledge was endless, and he had amazing talent and abundant energy to overcome any difficulties in research. Membership and honorary membership in twenty-one scientific groups around the world, eleven academic awards and medals, honorary doctorates from five famous universities—these many glorious records became a symbol of his greatness and success. The Canadian government also specially granted him an annual salary of seven thousand five hundred yuan from 1923 to show the country's rewards and recognition of scientists' meritorious service. But Dr. Banting was indifferent to fame and wealth. He voluntarily shared the Nobel Prize money with Dr. C. H. Best, who conducted research on insulin with him, and donated the US$10,000 he received to the "Banting Medical Research Fund" to establish a "Banting Research Institute" to broadly launch the research work of progressive medicine. There is no "enterprise" in the world more meaningful than this kind of "investment." Its "interest" is shared by people around the world and permanently shared by our descendants for generations to come.

Dr. Banting was a worldly scientist who constantly remembered the suffering masses, and he loved his motherland and human justice. During the First World War, he risked his life on the battlefield, doing arduous service work for the wounded soldiers. After the outbreak of the current European war, he was ordered to focus on the study of aviation medicine. However, when he was on his way to England with a major military mission, he unfortunately died. We cannot but recognize that he was indirectly killed by the flames of aggression. He was only fifty years old, a promising prime of life! This is truly a major blow and loss to humanity.

We must commemorate Dr. Banting by carrying out the work of benefiting the people. Here are a few of his famous sayings as our motto: "The human heart can never be satisfied, otherwise the world will stop progressing. The greatest joy in life is work. It should be obtaining, not possessing; it should be discarding, not conserving. I believe you can do anything you hope for, provided you have the determination to sacrifice, you can think, and you can work hard and constantly."

### Resentful Complaint

— Yi Zhi

Recently, Mother has been paying close attention to Father, whether he is smoking, walking, sitting, or standing, everything seems to make her angry. She seems dissatisfied with everything about Father, sulking all day long, just like a bitter enemy, unwilling to let go for a moment.

Father, who is usually very tolerant, can endure anything, but Mother's urgency also makes him furious.

Every day, the two often quarrel over a small matter, and as a result, Mother always sleeps in bed crying, and Father sighs.

Everything always leads to the problem of eating. "Eating" is the main reason for the two's quarrel.

"The price of rice is rising day by day, and we have to worry about how to fill our stomachs, and we still have to resent this complaint. I said long ago, sooner or later we will all starve to death!"

"You have a good heart, only hoping that everyone will starve... You will be a hundred times uncomfortable if you have no smoke to smoke for a few days..."

"Unless you come to gnaw on my old bones!"

"You little thief, loafing around all day long. People always think of ways outside, but you just lazily pace back and forth at home!..." Whenever the two quarrel, older brother becomes Father's outlet for venting his anger.

"Are you envious of others? Our ancestors didn't do evil, and it won't come to the point of selling our ancestors..."

"You discipline well, you teach your sons well. I am this old, I should be enjoying my blessings, but now I want to eat, I want to smoke..."

"He hasn't done anything thieving, hasn't done anything stealing...! He won't disgrace you. If the old don't lead, who will tell the young to go around recklessly? The old don't know shame!"

"The old are useless! They want them to find food for me to eat." He slammed the table, his eyes about to burst into flames.

Then, Mother timidly sheds tears—cries.

The two don't speak to each other for several days, but Mother secretly continues to pay attention to Father, and as soon as she catches a gap, they quarrel again.

Ah, once Father was planting a garden, Mother was leading the children, older brother was managing the business that Father handed over, and I was attending school. My home was a harmonious and cheerful paradise. Who forcibly occupied the homeland, who robbed the business, who stirred up conflicts between parents? Now, harmony and joy are far, far away from my home, gone without a trace, only filled with darkness and sorrow.

With my utmost effort, I believe that the lost harmony and joy will soon be pursued and brought back by me.

(7) A Cross Scratched on the Face

As soon as Qiu Haitang saw him, half of his body turned cold involuntarily. Although he had followed Xiangqi's instructions last month when he went to Tianjin and tried his best to refuse his demands, he had added a very big worry to his heart. He knew that this fellow, whose nature was dangerous and tenacious, like a poisonous snake, would never let him go. Although Xiangqi said in his letter that he would soon have the opportunity to speak to Yuan Baofan, asking him to stop Ji Zhaoxiong, and also warned him not to lend money to Ji Zhaoxiong again under any circumstances, as soon as that face with only skin and no flesh appeared, Qiu Haitang's heart immediately turned cold.

"... I haven't been on... on... stage for a long time... and I'm... I'm... also very short on funds myself...!" He put down the newspaper in his hand and said with a forced stammer.

With a single turn of Ji Zhaoxiong's triangular eyes, he knew that Qiu Haitang was a little timid. At the same time, he really needed money too much these days, so he decided to disregard everything and make a tough attempt on him for once.

"Don't lie in front of a real man, Boss Wu!" In just a second, his face had turned iron-blue, and he changed to an extremely tough tone. "As the saying goes, give convenience to others, and you'll get convenience yourself. Don't underestimate me, Ji Zhaoxiong. To be honest, asking you to borrow money is still being polite. If you provoke me, even if you wrap me up in banknotes, I won't regard you as a person!"

This time, Ji Zhaoxiong's calculation was completely wrong. What Qiu Haitang feared most in his life was people pestering him with a completely soft and shameless manner. Like this kind of hard collision, the result would instead arouse his stubbornness.

"You're being too impolite!" The head that was originally lowered suddenly raised up, and the eyes directly looked at Ji Zhaoxiong. "Don't say I don't owe you money. Even if I do owe it, I can't pay you if you treat me like this!" (87)

### It's Never Too Late to Learn

— Lan Yu

Cato began to learn Greek at the age of eighty. Socrates learned to play musical instruments when he was very old. Plutarch began learning Latin between the ages of seventy and eighty. Dr. Johnson learned Dutch a few years before his death. Ludivieo Monaldwsco wrote a chronicle of the major events of the time at the age of one hundred and fifteen. Ogilby didn't understand Latin and Greek until after the age of fifty. Franklin did not engage in science research until before the age of fifty. Dryden was sixty years old when he made his most satisfactory translation, "Aeneid". Baccaccio began studying simple literature at the age of thirty, but he later became one of the three great writers of the "Tuscan Language". The other two of these three authors were Dante and Petrarch.

New Film Introduction

### "The Philadelphia Story"

— Deng Shiying

In terms of story, "The Philadelphia Story" is one of the "romantic comedies" that Hollywood produced in large quantities last year. Seeing this type of story once in a while may spark some interest, but seeing it too much will become boring. What's more, screenwriters have different skills. With more and more films of the same type, there is comparison. In comparison, heights become immediately apparent, so it is even more difficult. So far, only "The Awful Truth" has left a deeper impression on people among the so-called "romantic comedies," and that is why. However, "The Philadelphia Story" also has its ways of attracting attention. This is none other than the actors. Katharine Hepburn has been away from us for a long time. Although this person is not beautiful, the photo stars are far inferior to her when it comes to acting; James Stewart gave a very good impression in films such as "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" in the past, and this film won him the Academy Award for Best Actor this year, so it is inevitable that people will pay attention to him even more. Cary Grant has appeared in films such as "The Awful Truth," so he is an old hand at acting in "romantic comedies," and of course we have to take a look at him too.

After watching it, I felt that Katharine Hepburn was good, but not strong enough. "Romantic comedy" is not very harmonious with her, not open enough and not hot enough; James Stewart's "affectionate fool" look is still the same. Although it is said that the unified control of the character is very strong (which may be the reason for winning the Academy Award), it is its commendable point, but I still feel that the work for which he won the Academy Award should be "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" rather than this film. Cary Grant's impression is not as deep as in films such as "The Awful Truth" due to the script.

Speaking of the script, I feel that this film only has cleverness but is not substantial enough overall. Some wonderful points are in the dialogue rather than the visuals, which is not a very good method. "Romantic comedy" is indeed an accumulation of cleverness, but this should be like chemistry rather than arithmetic.

The director's merits and demerits are similar to those of the screenwriter. The small commendable point is the use of the camera. This kind of use of small props to act is also one of the characteristics of recent Hollywood films. In this film, it is used a lot, and most of them are very good. As for the drum sounds that are paired with Tracie Lorde's divorce at the beginning and the effects that are paired when Tracie gets drunk and goes to drink, it is also its clever point. This cartoon-like effect cannot be seen or heard in Chinese films.

### Scattered Notes on the Art Scene

— Shou Yan

Some people call Lan Lan a boss lady. At first, I didn't understand why. Yesterday, I passed by her. According to her, she is going to open a teahouse. Then I suddenly understood. The location of the teahouse is upstairs from Mei Cun Candy Store next to Yiguang Grand Theater, specializing in Fujian dim sum, which is also quite novel. According to female actors in the theater world who open food stores, there was Wu Mei's "Mei Chong Zhen" before. Now Lan Lan has also become a boss lady. I wonder if anyone will follow suit in the future?

Six or seven groups, including the Hong Kong Baptist Middle School Deaf and Mute Society, have been visiting "Children of the World," a foreign-directed film, in crowds for days.

The wedding date of Diana Bowping and Feng Baoluo was originally set for June 7, but Haas wired the day before yesterday that Bowping finally "left child stardom and became a woman" on the 19th. A certain gentleman in the film industry said: It's a Date!

The position of publicity director of the Shanghai Drama and Art Society has been vacant for a long time since Mao Yu resigned. Recently, Wu Chongwen was appointed by Zhao Zhiyou, president of the society. Wu has been visiting various factional venues as a guest these days, just like the style of a "Beijing opera star."

### The Production of "Hong Xuanjiao"

— Deng Xiao

There have been many reviews of the performance of "Hong Xuanjiao," and I will only briefly introduce it from the perspective of historical materials. The author, Wei Ruhui, is a writer and also a textual researcher, so his "Hong Xuanjiao" is based on historical facts everywhere. He probably collected a lot of newspapers and magazines from the late Qing Dynasty. Most of these have nationalistic ideas, and of course, there are many articles about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. As for the biographical accounts of Xuanjiao that he mentioned, I have never seen a single one, and they are all rare. He has recently become very interested in "bibliography." The Cosmic Wind and Xue Lin either have or will have his articles of this type published. In that case, why not publish a catalog of the materials on which Hong Xuanjiao is based, just like the description of "Hero of the Seas"? For example, how to introduce the map of Jidaozhou Theater, Cheng Wenxiang's history revision, Gordon's meeting with Li Kaifang, and Chuan Sanxiang's articles are all valuable and interesting materials.

I know very little. The banners of the Four Kings, etc., in the first act seem to be based on Ling Shanqing's "Unofficial History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." The words on them were originally vertical, probably for the sake of the husband. The part about Hong Daquan seems to be based on Xie Yu and Rao's "Discussion on the Unofficial History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." The biography of Hong Daquan, the King of Heaven, contains the following: "After arriving in the capital, he was detained in the Ministry of Justice. The officials of the ministry interrogated him, but he stubbornly refused to tell the truth. When they spoke to him about the affairs of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, he would not say a word and was subsequently dismembered in the market." It also says: "When the Taiping Army first rose up, it seemed to be divided into two factions: the Ming restoration faction, led by Hong Daquan, and the Christian faction, led by Yang Xiuqing." According to the unofficial biography of Hong Daquan: "On the day of his execution, Daquan loudly recited the verse of the director's chamber: 'The Han people are all speaking the language of the barbarians, vying to scold the Han people from the city walls.'" This verse is from Tiankong Tu's seven-character quatrain "Feelings on the Hehuang," which originally read: "Ever since the war dust arose from Xiaoguan, Hehuang has been cut off from the spring of a foreign land. The Han people have learned the language of the barbarians, but they scold the Han people from the city walls." I was sitting in the last row and couldn't hear clearly, but it seemed that this poem was written by a Song and Yuan Dynasty literati; if I didn't hear it wrong, it seems that it should be corrected.

I couldn't see the couplet in the first act clearly because I was sitting too far away. Pages 61 and 62 of the unofficial history volume record the couplet. I don't know if it is based on this.

Li Xiucheng recited "Heroes have always shown their hearts and souls, brave men have never cherished their feathers!" in the fifth act. It is based on the famous sentence in Li's two poems on current events in Luo Yong et al.'s "Collection of Poems and Prose of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom."

I am very interested in this and hope that Ruhui can satisfy my request to list a catalog.

Chapter 7: Why Are the City Sieges and General Killings So Chaotic?

He still didn't know about the bandits on Green Stone Mountain, thinking that it was Li Xin's followers who were causing trouble. He walked outside, wanting to send someone to ask Youji Feng to bring troops to suppress them. Because after Shoubei Ma died in battle, a Youji Feng was replaced in the city. He had just taken office, and there were not many soldiers and horses, and his strength was still very weak, not enough to strengthen the city defenses. When the Qixian magistrate heard this news, he was so frightened that his face turned ashen. Trembling, he ran back to his room and woke up his beloved concubine, saying, "The Green Stone Mountain people and horses have entered the city. The Li family will definitely take revenge. Let's escape quickly." That concubine was also so frightened that she slumped to the ground. She put on her clothes and got out of bed, and said with a trembling voice, "Where can we escape to? And what about the many gold, silver, and jewels you have hidden? Are you willing to leave them behind?" The Qixian magistrate was reminded by his beloved concubine's words. He secretly thought that the fat and cream he had extracted from the common people through all kinds of means was also very hard-earned. If he didn't take it with him, wouldn't it be a pity? So he opened a large cabinet behind his bed. Many gold ingots and silver were piled up in the frame, shining brightly in yellow and white. However, this wooden cabinet was very bulky. How could he take 10,000 of gold and silver with him at once? He stared blankly at the gold and silver, unable to think of any idea. His beloved concubine took a jewelry box. The banquet box was full of jewelry and ornaments. She urged the Qixian magistrate, saying, "Let's go quickly! You hear that the voices outside are getting closer. There is also a fire rising in the east. My heart is almost broken with fear." The Qixian magistrate rubbed his hands and said, "How can I transport so much gold and silver out? It's better to call a few runners to help me take it away." The concubine said, "If you ask them to take it, I'm afraid they won't be reliable." The Qixian magistrate had no way to think. He was sweating profusely and jumping his feet, saying, "I usually only care about setting up hiding places, thinking that I can use them to build a retirement home and pass them on to my children and grandchildren in the future. Who knew that I would not be able to protect them today. What should I do!" While the Qixian magistrate was in a panic, Li Xin and Hong Niangzi and others had arrived and stormed into the room. The Qixian magistrate had nowhere to hide for a while. He locked himself under the bed. Li Xin had already seen it. He shouted, "Dog official, where are you escaping to? I, Li Xin, will not spare you." He bent down and reached under the bed and dragged the Qixian magistrate out. The beloved concubine was also captured by Hong Niangzi. (44)

### Summary of the Philosophy of Diligent Practice

— Zong Yu

The philosophy of diligent practice emphasizes practice and especially emphasizes diligence. If one practices without diligence, its effect will not be obvious. If others are advancing rapidly, while one walks slowly alone, the distance will increase day by day, and one will still inevitably be defeated. How can one practice in a way that counts as diligent? Of course, one must adopt a fighting approach.

### Theater News

— Jue Xin

Kun Dan Jin Yanxia, who was properly arranged to dance in the Tianchan Theater, returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon. After resting for a day, she will join the performance of the fourteen-episode Golden Dart Huang Tianba. The role she plays was originally rushed by Zhuan Su-lan from the first floor of the Xian Shi Paradise Theater, but now that Jin Yanxia has returned, she is still the main pillar in Paradise, so there is no problem.

Xun Huisheng has finished performing at the Gengxin Stage and will return to the Golden Grand Theater to sing for twelve days. Because Gai Huitian is ill and is recuperating in Renji Hospital, the Golden Grand Theater has no roles to perform. Since Xi Xiaobo and Hou Yulan cannot arrive in time, this plan has been internally decided. According to reports, Gai Huitian's condition has improved after receiving a blood transfusion in the hospital.
