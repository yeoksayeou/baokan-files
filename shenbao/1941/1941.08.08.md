### Parallel Notes Issued by Britain and the US Urging Thailand to Take a Firm Stand; Military Supplies to be Provided if Japan Attacks; Australia Reorganizes Air Force and Establishes Operational Headquarters

United Press, Washington, 7th. Responsible sources here stated yesterday that Britain and the United States had issued parallel notes urging Thailand to take a firm stand against Japan's demands for military bases. It was also stated that Britain and the United States would provide military supplies to Thailand if Japan attacked.

Washington, 6th. Well-informed sources say that the worst-case scenario for Thailand may erupt at any moment. Therefore, Britain and the United States are preparing to take parallel actions and joint military measures to resist Japan's further southward advance. News of the Japanese army's advance towards the Thai border has reached here, and Washington officials are now feeling a sense of crisis in Thailand and are showing a nervous mood. Secretary of State Hull's statement that the United States is watching the situation in Thailand with increasing seriousness was issued at the same time as British Foreign Secretary Eden's warning to Japan, and is therefore extremely noteworthy. What steps the US government will take are not yet indicated here, but it is widely believed that several US warships are currently concentrated in the South Pacific, awaiting government orders to serve as a backup for the US military. Commentators say that the time for empty words has passed and that the government must take decisive action and prepare for a final settlement with Japan.

United Press, Washington, 7th. Secretary of State Hull said at a press conference yesterday that any Japanese action against Thailand would be a matter of concern to the United States. Hull said this in response to questions from the audience asking for his opinion on the remarks made by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons. Hull said that the United States had repeatedly and clearly declared its opposition to conquest by force. He said that Deputy Secretary of State Welles' strong condemnation of Japan's aggression a few days ago was endorsed by him. When asked if this meant that if Japan took action against Thailand, it could be considered that the United States would take further action, Hull replied that it could be considered that the United States would increase its concern over this step.

Reuters, Washington, 7th. Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that if Japan invaded Thailand, the United States would regard it as a step that endangers American security and American territory in the Pacific. The US government has made it clear that it is closely watching and opposing any aggressive action in the Pacific and elsewhere, and this also applies to Thailand, he said. Hull said that there are signs that Japan is demanding military concessions from Thailand, and that the US government is increasingly concerned about this. America's emphasis on the integrity and independence of Thailand can be seen from the policy previously announced by the United States towards the southwestern Pacific, he said.

United Press, Rome, 7th. Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, yesterday defended Japan's "preparatory measures" in the Pacific against Britain and the United States. Gayda said in "Il Giornale d'Italia" that "the explosion of the Pacific powder keg is imminent."

United Press, Washington, 7th. Representative Bloom, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said yesterday that he did not think the situation in the Far East had reached a critical point. He also said that any public action by Japan would put Japan face to face with Britain, the Soviet Union, the Dutch East Indies, and the United States. He also said that the United States should express further and further resolve to Japan, and that this is the only tone that Japan will listen to.

Reuters, Melbourne, 7th. Australian Air Minister McEwen announced yesterday the reorganization of the Australian Air Force to deal with all possible wartime emergencies, and announced the establishment of a new Australian Air Force Operations Command to meet all strategic needs.

Reuters, Bangkok, 7th. Government officials announced that the Thai Eastern Army has established a tank squadron headquarters in the Battambang area. Several mechanized army units and a large number of police have already entered the area ceded to Thailand by Vietnam and set up outposts.

Reuters, Singapore, 7th. In commenting on the Far East crisis, the Bangkok wireless station reiterated that both Britain and Japan had guaranteed to respect the integrity of Thailand, and that Thailand trusts both sides. The station's reporter declared that Thailand is capable of defending itself and does not need protection from any country. The reporter added that they strongly disagree with the claim that the French recognized Vietnam's weakness.

### Japanese Information Bureau Spokesman Says Peaceful Relations to be Maintained with Thailand

United Press, Manila, 7th. Diplomatic and military circles here today believe that Japan is not yet prepared to take military action against Thailand, as Japan's actions towards Thailand are only intended to test the attitudes of Britain and the United States and to possibly obtain bases in Thailand. Military sources estimate that Japan has 50,000 to 60,000 troops in Vietnam, a number that would not be sufficient to defend against the British forces in Malaya even if they could establish military camps in Thailand. Moreover, the navies of the Dutch East Indies and the United States could attack Japanese transport ships carrying reinforcements in the China Sea. Observers generally believe that Japan must wait for one or two more international developments, such as unfavorable Soviet war developments, before taking military action against Thailand.

United Press, Tokyo, 7th. An Information Bureau spokesman said, "The warnings issued by Britain and the United States to Japan regarding Thailand are purely based on their own speculation and are without justification." He also said that the relationship between Japan and Thailand is a peaceful one, and Thailand is willing to continue this relationship. He added that the current accusations in the British and American newspapers that Japan has ulterior motives towards Thailand only serve to worsen the feelings of the Japanese people towards Britain and the United States.

United Press, Tokyo, 7th. The Japan Times & Mail declared in its evening edition today that Japan has no plans for Thailand.

Reuters, Tokyo, 7th. The Hochi Shimbun published an article accusing the British of using military force to pressure Thailand to join an anti-Japanese front, and said that if a serious situation arises as a result, Britain must take responsibility. It concluded by saying that Japan is currently watching Britain's future actions with the utmost attention.

### Malaya and Burma Have Sufficient Military Strength and are Determined to Resist Foreign Aggression

United Press, Singapore, 7th. Singapore Governor Thomas said yesterday in Penang that Malaya and Burma have sufficient military strength to defend their empire against all foreign aggression.

Havas, Portuguese Capital, 7th. The British government's special envoy to the Far East, Duff Cooper, arrived here by plane today and will transfer to Singapore.

Reuters, Singapore, 7th. Malaya Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Percival told reporters today that Japan's occupation of Vietnam has increased the military threat to Malaya. Therefore, Malaya must maintain a high state of readiness in both military and civilian defense. No one can predict what will happen in the Far East. We have no intention of aggression against others, but all military and civilians are determined to fulfill their duties to the country and the empire to protect this land. Since Japan has occupied air bases in Vietnam, the threat of a surprise attack on Malaya has increased. If Japan decides to enter Thailand and acquire more air bases, this threat will be further exacerbated. However, the Malayan army is fully prepared to cope with unforeseen circumstances. The British army has shown in recent battles that it can fight bravely in tropical climates, which is beyond expectations. The Australian army specializes in jungle warfare and can stay in the forest for three days, he said. He also said that the army's equipment is quite satisfactory and that a large organization has now been established to collect supplies from all aspects. A branch of the supply association will be established here soon to facilitate the distribution of supplies. Finally, he said that a large number of reinforcements arrived here on July 19 and August 5, which shows that the sea is still safe. If Malaya is under a more serious threat, more reinforcements will continue to arrive.

United Press, Singapore, 7th. Lieutenant General Percival said that it is very important for Britain to follow the United States' Far East policy, because this US Far East policy has the greatest impact on Japanese policy. He also said that the merger of the Philippine Army into the US Far East Army, commanded by Lieutenant General MacArthur, is an excellent plan because "unity of command is most effective in the defense of any country." He has just returned from an inspection of Malaya. He said that the British, Australian, Indian, and Asian armies all recognize the importance of defending Malaya. The situation in the past few weeks has made military officers realize that training Malayans is of real significance. The importance of Malaya's position is unprecedented in the history of the Empire, so we are determined to do our best to make the defense the most complete. At present, the defense here is enough to put Malaya in a position of self-defense. He also said that the most important thing in the actions of Britain and the United States, whether in politics or other aspects, is unity of action, because the policy of the United States undoubtedly has the greatest influence on Japan's Far East policy. He declined to comment on "what will happen soon." With the exception of slight dissatisfaction with the response to the local conscription of reservists, he expressed absolute satisfaction with the defense of Malaya. He said that "the equipment, morale, and strength of the troops here are ready to deal with any powerful aggressor."

### Comparison of Soviet and Japanese Military Strength in the Far East

Reuters, London, 7th. Today, some facts about the Soviet and Japanese military strength in the Far East were published here as follows: In Siberia, the Soviet Union currently has some of its best-trained and best-equipped troops stationed there. There are three armies along the Chinese and Manchurian borders, and a large number of troops are concentrated in Vladivostok. The total number is about one million. Japan has 250,000 troops stationed in Manchuria and northern Korea, and this number is gradually increasing. At the same time, it is also reported that Japan is concentrating troops between Harbin and the northern Korean border.

China also understands the importance of using various opportunities to improve and strengthen contact with Malaya and India.

### Japanese Army in Vietnam Requisitioning Ships; Convoys of Vehicles Heading West

Reuters, Saigon, 7th. The political atmosphere in southern Vietnam remains calm on the surface. Japanese troops have landed and are making full use of the ports and conveniences. Truck convoys are heading west in an endless stream. Most of the large number of vehicles concentrated in the Saigon docks yesterday have disappeared today, as Japanese transport ships have again transported thousands of soldiers and driven away with vehicles. The transportation of troops and materials is proceeding at a rapid pace. Only a very small number of troops remain stationed in Saigon. Engineering teams are rapidly erecting military telephone lines between the important centers and offices they occupy. It is reported that only 80 trucks can pass through the Mekong River ferry on the road to Phnom Penh each day, which greatly hinders the advance of the Japanese army. The Japanese army is requisitioning a large number of ships to carry large quantities of materials up the Mekong River. Japanese newspapers' hours of criticism of Thailand have led to much speculation here about the ultimate intentions of the Japanese army in Cambodia.

### US Government Will Continue to Draft Soldiers; Other Officers Dispatched to the Philippines

United Press, Washington, 7th. Florida Democratic Representative Pepper predicted that the government will continue to draft soldiers, and that service in the National Guard and Reserve will be at least five or ten years, or even indefinitely. Pepper has always been regarded as a spokesman for the government. He also predicted that national defense spending should be US$30 billion. He added that the urgency of the situation in the United States cannot be described in words.

United Press, Washington, 7th. The War Department again appointed 23 officers yesterday to work in the Philippines, with ranks ranging from lieutenant to captain. Three other officers were transferred from the Philippines to the mainland.

Editorial

### Review of Price Changes and Control Measures

There are many theories about prices, including the law of supply and demand, the quantity theory of money, the cost theory, and the investment theory. Some theories fit the institutions of Country A but clash with those of Country B. In one place and at one time, the theory and the facts may merge and connect, but as time passes and circumstances change, they become square pegs in round holes, incompatible. In short, there are many different theories, and no one knows which one is correct. This is because each country has its own different economic foundations and unique economic life. If one theory is used to try to cover all economic activities in all eras around the world and describe them vividly, it would be like sitting in a well and watching the sky, or climbing a tree to catch a fish! Considering that European and American countries are built on similar economic foundations, scholars have still not been able to prescribe a method for price changes or recognize a theory to represent all changes. If the economic activities of countries with different economic development are compared and the clues are explored, it will inevitably lead to contradictory results. From this, it can be seen that the factors of price changes are complex and far less accurate than the principles of natural science and the simplicity of causal relationships. This is why those in charge of price stabilization in various countries cannot allow prices to be adjusted naturally.

As for prices in our country, in the treaty ports where Chinese and foreigners lived together in the past, due to the potential for special stimulating factors, drastic changes often occurred. However, in the interior, except for a very small number of price fluctuations, most prices were able to maintain a stable state for a long period of time. In recent years, the war has expanded to the whole country, and the lives of people in various places have suffered unprecedented difficulties due to drastic price fluctuations. The Shanghai market, claiming to be an international market, has people who are good at taking advantage of opportunities and imitating the minor skills of Europe and the United States. They will do anything to gain profit. Even in times of internal and external troubles, they still try to plunder the people's wealth and even their meager savings to use them as gambling chips in the market and fill their pockets. Such a life, its impact on people's hearts and its harm are beyond words, and the severity of its reflection on price fluctuations can be imagined. However, commentators often stick to their own opinions, picking up stale sayings to cover up, and turn a deaf ear to the speculative economic foundation of the Shanghai market, which is quite strange. Furthermore, if the speculative life of the Shanghai market and the resulting speculative prices are transplanted to various border areas, although there will be people who are happy, the harm to the future of the national economy will be unthinkable.

Our definition of prices here is not to exhaust the principles, but to bring out the essence, so that the crux of the relationship between prices and people's livelihood can be determined. Now that the factors of price changes in our country are clear, we can talk about adjustment countermeasures, and the most effective method is to implement a planned control policy. At present, when any country deals with the problem of prices, there is no other effective method to be said except the implementation of control. A few days ago, the person in charge of the Shanghai Municipal Council said that the control of prices in the Shanghai market is urgently needed. We have repeatedly suggested that not only Shanghai should do so, but also remote areas should urgently implement this plan. The Shanghai Municipal Council's control of rice prices is the most powerful evidence of a system that benefits the people's livelihood. By analogy, there is no reason why other daily necessities cannot be controlled one by one to relieve the suffering of the people. We do not hesitate to be tedious and repeatedly explain the essentials of control, because we love the people's livelihood and dare not lag behind others. All compatriots will surely give sympathy, and the authorities concerned will surely work day and night to repay the heavy trust placed in them.

In order to make it easier to grasp the reasons for implementing control, we will summarize the main points below as a conclusion. In today's world of rapid evolution, the laissez-faire doctrine in the capitalist system has long been abandoned by various countries, and our country has replaced it with the Principle of People's Livelihood, which is known to all Chinese people. In practice, our government's social undertakings, such as the salaries of officials, the salaries of teachers, and the wages of workers, all have clear regulations and are subject to some control. Now only the market price of commodities enjoys the exceptional privilege of laissez-faire, and there is a distinction between preferential and inferior treatment. How can it be said to be fair? Moreover, the impact of prices on people's livelihood and the lack of automatic adjustment function have been mentioned above, so there is hardly any objection to the urgent need to control prices. During this period of national crisis, laissez-faire management and all speculative activities have been prohibited by various countries, but this international market has been allowed to enjoy this special privilege, and it is not necessary to be wise to know whether it is a blessing or a curse.

### After Japanese Troops Arrived in Vietnam One After Another, Chinese Troops in Yunnan Have Been on Guard to Prevent Japanese Troops from Attacking the Yunnan-Burma Highway; Most of the Two Japanese Divisions in Yichang Have Been Withdrawn

Military News. The Chinese military does not pay much attention to the battles near Shashi, north of Yichang on the north bank of the Yangtze River. It is now believed that the Japanese army's offensive in various places is aimed at testing the strength of the Chinese army and trying to disperse the Chinese army concentrated in the area upstream of the Yangtze River in Hankou, which threatens the Japanese army's positions. Since the Japanese army arrived in Vietnam one after another, the Chinese supreme command has made necessary preparations in Yunnan Province to prevent the Japanese army from attacking the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Reuters learned that the central and Yunnan provincial authorities are very satisfied with the defense plan and the distribution of troops (Reuters, 7th).

Chongqing. The Chinese military spokesman hosted reporters this afternoon and reported on the progress of the battle near Yichang. It is estimated that the Japanese army in Yichang had two divisions. Now one division and one brigade have been withdrawn. The purpose of the Japanese army's attack this time is to strengthen the outer defenses of Yichang (Reuters, 7th).

Enshi. After the Japanese army invaded Fenxiangchang this time, the commander of the 26th Brigade was treated, and his condition was very dangerous.

It is also rumored that Major General Ryokaku, the commander of the Japanese army's Jingzhou and Shashi garrison, was also killed by the Chinese guerrilla team between Jiangling and Shilipu (6th).

Chongqing. The Chinese military spokesman announced today that in the past two weeks, the Japanese army has launched three attacks on the north of Yichang with 1,000, 2,000, and 13,000 troops respectively, but all of them were repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army's goal was obviously to disperse the Chinese army concentrated 20 miles north of Yichang. The Chinese army launched a counterattack and repelled the last attack of the Japanese army. They are now encircling and clearing the Japanese army. The Japanese army stationed in the Yichang area currently has two divisions. One division in Shashi and one mixed brigade in Jingmen (formerly translated) have gradually retreated. While the battle north of Yichang was in progress, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army's positions west of Yichang and recaptured four villages. Between August 3 and 7, 6,000 Japanese troops attacked the Chinese army's concentration point in Haoxue (formerly translated), 20 miles southeast of Shashi, in three routes, but two routes were repulsed and one route was blocked (United Press, 7th).

Chongqing. Military news.

### British Foreign Secretary Reports in House of Commons: Situation After Nazi Invasion of Soviet Union; Germany No Less Than Engaged in Three-Front War; Warns Japan Not to Attack Thailand

Reuters, London, 7th. During a debate on the war in the House of Commons yesterday, Foreign Secretary Eden said that the balance of the war had indeed shifted after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, and this shift had also had consequences within Germany. He believed that Hitler had disrupted the fate of his own people with his sudden actions. Hitler initially made his people believe that communism was their enemy, then made a treaty with the Soviet Union two years ago and greatly changed his style, and now he has changed again and again, causing his people to change with him. Of course, this kind of behavior has disrupted the German people's belief in the purpose of Germany's war, which can be seen in the wording of German communiqués. A few days ago, I said that there should be a distinction between the military treatment of Germany and the economic treatment of Germany in the post-war settlement. In terms of military affairs, all precautions should be taken to prevent Germany from plunging Europe into war again, so that Germany can change its temperament of creating and assisting Hitler, but we cannot be careless in this regard. In terms of economy, the situation is different. It is not in our interest to suppress the German economy to the lowest level. If the German economy is bankrupt after the war, it will be harmful to Europe. The British government is well aware that this situation creates opportunities for political warfare. We are now making some changes in adjusting and implementing our political warfare work. I believe that this change can promote more progress. We are now in an era of greater opportunities than we had before political warfare. I can assure you that, as far as the British government is concerned, we understand that there is such an opportunity. Mr. Attlee said recently that there are two front lines in the war, which is true. I dare to say that the war is not only on two front lines, but there is also naval and air warfare in the Mediterranean at this time, which is the third front line. Germany's plan should not be based on a two-front war. This is the essence of what Mr. Attlee called a two-front war. As for what measures we will take in the future, this is certainly not to let the enemy know. Eden then spoke about the situation in the Far East, saying that the freeze plan is not, as some people think, to allow transactions that are not explicitly prohibited to continue. In fact, this plan prohibits all kinds of transactions except those that are explicitly permitted. I cannot disclose the details of the implementation of this policy. In short, the British government, its autonomous colonies, and the governments of the United States and the Netherlands will implement it thoroughly with extremely close cooperation and extremely frank discussions. The governments of the United States and the Netherlands have now provided Britain with all the information about their attitudes. As for the implementation and application of this plan, they are also continuing to cooperate and exchange opinions and information with each other in order to seek a common understanding on this far-reaching experiment like the freeze order. It will inevitably take some time, but this work has now been largely completed. This kind of step is not taken lightly. The freeze order has been carefully considered and will be strictly implemented. Eden spoke about the status of Thailand, saying that Japanese newspapers are now using their old tricks again, applying the same tone to Thailand that Japan used to apply to Vietnam before it demanded a base in Vietnam. The British government has taken note of this, so the British ambassador to Japan has specifically asked the Japanese foreign minister to pay attention to this kind of propaganda in the newspapers, which includes statements that Britain is carrying out conspiracies in Thailand, that British military preparations are threatening Japanese interests, and that Thailand should reach an understanding with Japan as soon as possible for its own interests. The British ambassador declared to the Japanese foreign minister that this kind of propaganda can be seen as the authorities in Japan hoping to create an excuse for Japan to invade Thailand. If this kind of step is implemented after the action in Vietnam, it will inevitably cause a very serious situation between Britain and Japan. The British ambassador also officially stated to the Japanese foreign minister that the claim of British attempts to invade Thailand is completely unfounded. In fact, British-Thai friendship has lasted for more than a hundred years, and Britain has no other purpose than to maintain this relationship as a policy. The same is true: any action that could threaten the independence and integrity of Thailand will become an immediate concern of Britain, especially because it threatens the security of Singapore. I hope this statement will be noted by Japan. Eden's tone was quite solemn when he said this, and the listeners applauded.

Reuters, London, 7th. Foreign Secretary Eden claimed in the House of Commons yesterday that as a result of Japan's retaliatory actions against Britain's freezing of Japanese funds in British territory, British businessmen in North China have been slightly interfered with, but the government has not yet received information that any British businesses have been seized. Local British authorities are closely monitoring the situation.

### Rumor that Germany Presented Ultimatum to Vichy, Demanding France Provide Military Bases

United Press, London, 7th. The Soviet official news agency TASS reported from Bern today that Germany had presented Vichy with an ultimatum with a deadline of August 10, demanding military bases in Casablanca and Dakar. Vichy refused Germany's request on August 3, and Germany then began plotting to overthrow Marshal Pétain and Admiral Darlan. Admiral Darlan has proposed that if Germany is willing to give up its demand for Dakar, France can cede Algiers and Casablanca.

Reuters, Vichy, 7th. After the United States asked France to clarify its policy on defending its empire, France has submitted a reply to US Ambassador Leahy. The reply reportedly "outlines the guiding principles of French policy, as stipulated by Darlan and Weygand."

### Darlan Arrives in Paris

Havas, Paris, 6th. Cabinet Associate General Darlan arrived here last night and immediately met with Brinon, the commissioner in the occupied zone, Putilier, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Biseau, the Minister of the Interior, Meyssonnier, the deputy director of the associate commissariat, and Scapini, the director of the war prisoner administration office, for discussions. However, according to well-informed sources here, Associate Darlan's trip has no special significance.

### France Denies Pétain is Seriously Ill

United Press, Vichy, 7th. The French Propaganda Bureau issued a statement yesterday, saying that the news broadcast by British radio that Marshal Pétain was seriously ill was not propaganda, but a slanderous remark insulting the French people.

### British House of Commons Questions the Syrian Affair

Reuters, London, 7th. Yesterday, there were questions in the House of Commons about the Syrian affair. Foreign Secretary Eden claimed that the British government was not aware that General Catroux had declared that he could not conclude a treaty with the Syrian government to grant Syria independence until all parts of Syria had been completely occupied by the Free French army. However, the first step is clearly for the Syrian border to be occupied by the allied forces. He hopes that this action will be completed as soon as possible. As for the future administration of Syria, the British government believes that the Free French authorities are well aware that the administration of the previous regime was not satisfactory, and believes that they have the ability to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with the Syrian government.

Reuters, London, 7th. Yesterday, a member of the House of Commons asked about British civilians detained in enemy countries or enemy-occupied countries. Foreign Secretary Eden said that the release of these civilians must be carried out mutually by both sides. Since the British government's policy does not allow the release of enemy people of military age, neither does the enemy. Therefore, the British side has not tried to arrange for the repatriation of British men who were graduating from European universities at the time of the outbreak of the war. Although the British government has generally negotiated the repatriation of overseas Chinese on a reciprocal basis, it has not yet reached an understanding on the route of repatriation. The German side refuses to guarantee the safety of any ships carrying civilians in and out of Britain, resulting in temporarily little progress.

### French Coastal Occupied Areas Attacked Again

International News Service, London, 7th. It was announced here today that British aircraft bombed the French coastal occupied areas around Calais and Boulogne this morning, and heavy explosive bombs fell on military targets. Residents of the southeastern coast of England all saw the flashes of German anti-aircraft guns and heard the howling of the northwest wind, which obscured the sound of the bombs exploding. A few hours ago, German coastal artillery bombarded Dover, destroying 20 houses and injuring three men and two women. German aircraft attempted to attack the Thames estuary but were repelled by intense British anti-aircraft fire. An official communiqué stated that some high-explosive bombs fell on several places in southeastern London, but there was no serious damage. When British aircraft bombed Calais and Boulogne on the sea, the people of Kent also saw a net of anti-aircraft fire and searchlight beams, and saw the flames rising into the sky when the bombs exploded, but the sound of the explosions was also obscured by the northwest wind.

### Indian Poet and Philosopher Tagore Passes Away

Havas News Agency, Calcutta, 7th. Indian poet and philosopher Tagore (see photo) passed away here today at the age of eighty. Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913. His famous works include "The Gardener" and "The Crescent Moon."

### Britain Detains Finnish Ships

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 7th. A London communiqué last night stated that since Britain and Finland severed diplomatic relations, twelve Finnish ships (30,000 tons) docked in British ports have lost their freedom of navigation. It is reported that the British authorities intend to send the Finnish ships to the British Prize Court, and then the court will rule that they be used by the British government.

### Britain to Recognize Abyssinia

Reuters, London, 7th. Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government intends to recognize the independence of Abyssinia when the military situation allows. At that time, diplomatic arrangements will naturally be established. The evacuation of civilians in Abyssinia is already underway, but it is restricted by traffic and transportation.

### US Publishing Tycoons Henry and Clare Boothe Luce's Chongqing Mountain City Visit Notes (4)

Four

As the dark clouds gradually dissipated, we were summoned to the airplane runway in the riverbed. In the open space I saw the smallest airplane in the world. The back seat of the airplane was made of green leather. We shook hands with the pilot, Mr. Yang. We flew into the mountains of Chongqing in broken clouds. The airplane was driven very steadily. Mr. Yang was good. My wife sat with him in the front. Mr. Dong and I sat in the back. Mr. Dong fell soundly asleep when we reached eight thousand feet.

We passed through a hundred miles of crisscrossing paths, and saw tall mountains and dense forests again. This place was very beautiful. When we flew to the highest mountain peak (twelve thousand feet), it was dusk. The clouds gathered on the top of the mountain. Mr. Yang suddenly felt that he had run too much on the road in one day. He turned back and headed towards Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan, the largest city in Shu. After an hour, the mountain peaks gradually lowered. We flew quickly over a plain, a flat expanse of rice paddies, a hundred miles long and fifty miles wide. In the dim twilight, Mr. Yang circled the city halfway, notifying them of this unexpected arrival. We landed at the Chengdu airport.

Tomorrow morning, we will immediately leave this rice-producing plain and fly to the mountains. In the north, we have turned into the endless Shaanxi plain. That area does not produce rice, only wheat, miles and miles of beautiful golden wheat, just right for harvesting. Nor are there many farmhouses scattered among the fields. Here begins the rural life of North China. A village has one hundred to one thousand households, and each household has a large tree, with a large courtyard under the tree. We flew straight ahead and saw a large city with a very long city wall. This is Xi'an. We circled at the airport. The airplane came down, a very steady landing. The plane was still gliding. Mr. Yang stopped the airplane. We jumped out. A detachment of soldiers ran over and crowded us into a car. This car drove into the city, but it chose the rural roads to take. Later, we learned that it was because there was an air raid alarm. Within minutes of the airplane landing, we were crouching in the tall wheat fields. There were many companions in the fields, not only farmers but also people who had rushed out of the city, crouching or standing for a while in the golden wheat waves. At the same time, we parked the car in a narrow ditch, covered with brown tarpaulin.

But we did not wait long. They guessed that Japanese aircraft would not fly to Xi'an, so we got back into the car. We did not enter the city, but went to an ancient temple near the east gate. In the courtyard of the ancient temple, there was a pagoda.

We were led to a very cool room behind the pagoda by a young director who looked very intelligent. We had not yet had lunch. The director entertained us with tea and exquisite biscuits. Then he took out a map and explained it to us. Immediately, a energetic young military officer came out to report. He explained it to us very casually in English. He was the son of Chiang Kai-shek, now a lieutenant, leading a small detachment of fifty soldiers.

We wanted to see this ancient capital of the Han Dynasty, the cradle of Chinese culture, the vast and famous city of Xi'an. But we must first meet with the chairman of Shaanxi Province. His residence is difficult to describe - an ordinary Western-style brick house. His surname is Jiang, the same surname as the chairman. The translator, Mr. Dong, gave him a hand-lettered letter from the chairman. Chinese rulers traditionally write a good hand. The chairman's handwritten letter was, of course, shocking.

This visit was very hasty. Immediately we were able to roam freely in this city. It is difficult for us to see the glory left over from this ancient city. Because of our lack of knowledge of Chinese history, we do not know from which era the beauty of Xi'an began to disappear. What strikes me in the inland cities is how these many cities have become modernized. Although these cities would not remind a visitor to think of Saint Louis, Missouri, or Des Moines, Iowa, I did see American-style, twentieth-century features: straight, long streets, sidewalks planted with many young trees on the side. The things displayed in the stores included suits and thermos bottles (apparently very popular in China), and there were rickshaws—thousands of rickshaws that I only saw in a few of the treaty ports, such as Shanghai and Hong Kong, in my youth. In addition, there were rubber tires, even a bullock cart had rubber tires! The only thing that remained unchanged was the small cart, the unpainted axles of which (under excessive loading) emitted a monotonous roar. Under this kind of sound, one person was trying his best to push this overweight wheel.

The chairman of Shaanxi Province and his wife invited us to dinner—there were many dishes. The chairman's secretary was from Shandong, and I was also born in this province. In his English conversation, he seemed very forgiving of Hitler, so I wanted to speak a little more harshly to this fellow provincial.

At eleven o'clock in the afternoon, we arrived at the station. This station was a very beautiful Chinese-style building, one side of which was destroyed by bombs. This railway runs through the middle of North China, from Baoji, about one hundred miles west of Xi'an, all the way to the coast of Shandong, a total distance of six or seven hundred miles. The Chinese army guards the area from Baoji to two hundred miles east of Xi'an. We wanted to go there and see. We set off by car immediately.

We talked directly with two or three military officers until midnight, especially with a graduate of the London School of Economics, who is now a major in the political department of the 34th Army. After the talk, we went to sleep. At half past three in the morning, Mr. Dong came to knock on our door. We had to arrive at Qian before dawn. We hurriedly set off from the station town. The sky was still dark, and it was very cold. We walked on the plain, and the east was just beginning to turn white. In the sunlight, Mount Hua could be seen, which the Chinese consider to be the most beautiful of many mountains. Throughout the day, we always saw this purple mountain. In the distant places we could see, there was a long mountain, which was quite interesting to us at this time. The mountain range was on the side of the Yellow River.

### US and Soviet Union Exchange Notes: Economic Assistance to the Soviet Union, Strengthening Joint Cooperation Against Aggression, Soviet Ambassador Expresses Gratitude to the US

TASS, Moscow, July 7th: On August 2nd, US Under Secretary of State Welles and Soviet Ambassador to the US, Oumansky, exchanged notes. Welles' note stated, "Your Excellency, I have the honor to inform you that the US government has decided to provide your country with all possible economic assistance to enhance the Soviet Union's strength in its war against aggression. The US government firmly believes that the Soviet Union's resistance to perfidious aggressors is closely related to the national defense of the United States. This is because aggressors not only threaten the security and independence of the Soviet Union but also endanger the independence and security of other countries. The US government's decision to assist the Soviet Union is based on this belief. In accordance with the US government's decision and the aforementioned policy, the US authorities will give friendly consideration to requests from Soviet organizations for the purchase of defense supplies. At the same time, in order to expedite delivery, the US government has decided to give the Soviet Union preferential treatment in accordance with the principle of purchasing goods at the request of anti-aggression countries. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the smooth implementation of economic assistance to the Soviet Union, the US State Department will issue unrestricted permits allowing various defense supplies needed by the Soviet Union to be shipped to that country. This measure is in line with the US principle of supplying goods to all anti-aggression countries. As for all conveniences for the transportation of goods from the US to the Soviet Union, the US authorities have also given sympathetic consideration in accordance with the above decision." Ambassador Oumansky's reply stated, "Acting Secretary of State, I am pleased to read your letter. You informed me that the US government has decided to provide our country with all possible economic assistance to enhance our country's strength in resisting aggression. You also stated that the US government believes that the Soviet Union's resistance to perfidious aggressors is closely related to the national defense of the United States. I hereby, on behalf of my government, solemnly state that your view is accurate. The aggressors who invade our territory simultaneously threaten the safety and independence of all freedom-loving countries and are certainly related to the national defense of those countries. I have been authorized by my government to express my gratitude to the US government for its friendly decision. At the same time, I firmly believe that the economic assistance your country provides to us will be extensive, enabling our country to fully exert its anti-aggression resistance capabilities. As you said, the Soviet Union's resistance is closely related to the national defense of the United States. As for your statement in the note that 'In order to comply with the US government's decision and policy, the US authorities will give friendly consideration and preferential treatment to requests from Soviet organizations for the purchase of defense supplies,' I am also very pleased to hear it. This is my reply."

Reuters, Washington, July 7th: Goods worth tens of millions of dollars ordered by the Soviet Union in the United States have now been unfrozen by the United States.

US-Soviet Trade Agreement Remains in Effect

TASS, Moscow, August 1st: Soviet Ambassador to the US, Oumansky, and US Acting Secretary of State Welles exchanged the following identical notes on the renewal of the US-Soviet trade agreement: "In accordance with the recent negotiations, I hereby confirm that the trade agreement signed between the US and the Soviet Union will continue to be in effect, with the validity period extended to August 6, 1942. The new agreement will be approved by the Soviet People's Committee and the US President. The US-Soviet trade agreement was originally signed on August 4, 1937, through an exchange of letters between the two parties, and came into effect on August 6 of the same month. It was renewed three times on August 5, 1938, August [blank space], 1939, and August 6 of last year."

Havas, Washington, July 6th: Machine tools ordered by the Soviet Union from the United States before the German-Soviet war have already been shipped from the western coastal states of the United States to the Soviet Union. However, officials refused to provide details about the cargo, including which country's ships were used for transportation.

### Red Army Repels German Troops in Smolensk Region, Fierce Fighting at Bylayeva Chakov, Elite German Division Annihilated

TASS, Moscow, July 7th: The Soviet Information Bureau announced the night war report of the 6th, stating that during the day, our army fought fiercely in the Kakhskholm, Smolensk, Bylayeva Chakov village area, and on the Estonian front. There were no other major battles on other fronts. Our air force struck enemy motorized units and artillery units on the front lines. Fourteen German planes were destroyed on the 5th, and our side lost seven.

United Press, Moscow, July 7th: Soviet official private sources stated yesterday that Soviet troops had repelled German troops a "considerable distance" in the Smolensk region. This news comes directly from Smolensk, which is believed to be firmly held by the Soviet Union. Frontline reports indicate that German troops are attempting to penetrate the area of Kholm, located 110 miles east of the Leningrad-Moscow railway. It is widely believed that the Nazis' ultimate goal in this area is the upper reaches of the Volga River. It is reported that the Red Army is currently firmly defending the Kholm area, preventing the German advance. The German plan is to shift the Soviet resistance line south of Leningrad, so that German troops can approach Moscow from the northwest or encircle Smolensk from the rear. The battle for the central point of Smolensk is now in its twenty-first day, but the German army has no advantage. The battles on the Ukrainian front are said to be continuing, with particularly fierce fighting near Kiev at Bylayeva Chakov.

TASS, Moscow, July 7th: Red Army officers and soldiers under the command of Army Colonel Tiezhensky annihilated a German SS division named "Totenkopf." The details of the division's annihilation are as follows: A German elite division arrived on the Eastern Front and was immediately detected by the Soviet troop command. In the early morning, a patrol group led by Adjutant Shavalyev captured German Corporal Stimmler, who wore a skull badge on his collar. He said that his division was composed of Nazi SS troops and had fought in France and would carry out a "fierce blow" in a certain area on the Eastern Front. The corporal also said that the entire division was full of fighting spirit. The division consisted of two infantry regiments and two artillery regiments and was ready to attack. Soon after, the division began to attack. Army Colonel Tiezhensky ordered the artillery to open fire on the advancing German troops. Enemy tanks, motorcycles, and machine guns were blown to pieces and thrown into the air. Intoxicated fascist troops, supported by tanks, attacked our army again. Our soldiers calmly waited for them to approach before opening fire with rifles, machine guns, and artillery. During the intense fighting, high-speed Soviet aircraft appeared overhead and dropped bombs on the enemy. When the "Totenkopf" division's morale faltered, Red Army soldiers launched a bayonet charge and completely annihilated the fascist division. The German command attempted to retreat to the rear in trucks but was immediately destroyed by the Red Army. According to accurate statistics, about 2,500 German soldiers were killed or wounded, 30 light tanks and armored vehicles, 80 motorcycles, 500 automatic rifles, 90 machine guns, and 45 small cannons were destroyed.

### Polish Military Delegation Arrives in Moscow

### British and Soviet Cultural Figures Hold a Joint Celebration

TASS, [day blank] July, London: The British-Soviet Cultural Liaison Association held a celebration on the 4th, with ten thousand people participating. The enthusiastic atmosphere was unprecedented since the autumn of 1939. Novikov spoke on behalf of the Soviet Embassy, followed by a reply from Brandebill, "I firmly believe that fascism will be defeated on the Eastern Front, and the cooperation between the Soviet and British peoples will achieve victory." The audience responded with enthusiastic applause. The donations collected at the celebration have been used as a British wartime fund, with another portion given to the Soviet Red Cross for use.

### Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Red Army Broadcasts to Occupied Areas, Urges Farmers to Intensify Guerrilla Warfare

TASS Warfront Report, July 7th: Marshal Voroshilov, Commander-in-Chief of the Northwestern Front of the Red Army, and Zhdanov, Secretary of the Leningrad Regional Committee of the Soviet Socialist Party, appealed to the Soviet people in the areas currently occupied by fascists, "Comrades, working masses, collective farmers, intellectuals, men and women, etc., Fascist bandits have now occupied some Soviet territory. German fascists are robbing our wealth, raping our wives and sisters, destroying our families, and causing our children to suffer calamities." Voroshilov and Zhdanov warned the people in the occupied areas that the enemy is insidious and cunning, and fascist jackals loot the wealth of the Soviet people like hungry wolves. Fascists sometimes even use the wealth of the Soviet people that they have looted to entice our people, in order to quell our people's resentment of them. The article continued, "Comrades, brothers and sisters, in response to the call of our teacher, leader, and friend, the great Stalin, we should quickly rise up to fight against the German aggressors who enslave your freedom, honor, and ancestors, organize guerrilla teams, intercept enemy weapons and ammunition, and strike the enemy day and night." Voroshilov and Zhdanov asked the people not to lose hope, to gather all their strength to retaliate against the fascists, and to comfort the suffering of their mothers, wives, and children. The people were very moved by this appeal. Some people in the occupied areas said, "We are extremely pleased after listening to this call. Voroshilov and Zhdanov said that the Red Army will definitely join forces with you to destroy the enemy and fight for your freedom, which encourages us. The people in the occupied areas know that Stalin and his soldiers care about them. They deeply know that all the Soviet people miss them and that the end of the fascists is near."

### Dutch Ship Intercepts French Ship

Reuters, Batavia, July 7th: The French ship Plaines, sailing from Vietnam, was intercepted by a Dutch ship and brought to Tanjung Priok port.

The crew is currently temporarily free.

### Rumor: Hitler Offers Peace Terms to Britain, But Must Maintain German Position in the Balkans, San Francisco Daily Says No Peace with Germany

Reuters, New York, July 7th: An unconfirmed report from Ankara, Turkey, via NBC, claims that Hitler has offered peace terms to Britain, including the withdrawal of German troops from Western Europe, but maintaining its position in the Balkans.

Reuters, San Francisco, July 7th: The San Francisco Daily says that peace with Hitler is impossible. Hitler does not know peace exists. Hitler has never kept his promises. There can be no peace until Hitler's machinery is completely broken and beyond repair.

### President Roosevelt Continues Cruise at Sea, Meeting with British Prime Minister Likely to Happen, Location Said to Be on the Canadian Border

Reuters, Washington, July 7th: A message from the President's yacht yesterday afternoon said that President Roosevelt is currently cruising off the coast of New England. The message was brief and did not mention the rumored meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill.

United Press, Washington, July 7th: Chairman Bloom of the House Foreign Affairs Committee visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday and later told people that there was no strong evidence to prove the rumored meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. However, he said that such a meeting was "a wonderful idea because the two could have a long talk for several hours, which would be more effective than countless exchanges of notes and phone calls."

United Press, New York, July 7th: Although officials in Washington and London are keeping silent about the meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, rumors continue to circulate. According to the latest and unconfirmed reports, Roosevelt has boarded a high-speed cruiser on the high seas and is speeding towards a secret meeting place with Prime Minister Churchill. It is also reported that Hopkins, the aide in charge of aid to Britain, and Canadian Prime Minister King are also participating in the meeting. Most observers here believe that the rumors of the meeting between the two, whether officially acknowledged or not, may soon become a reality.

Reuters, Washington, July 7th: Yesterday's discussion materials were almost entirely about the actions of Churchill and Roosevelt. The general public believed that the two were in a meeting. The US President must have taken a warship to a certain place, and the British Prime Minister flew to meet him. However, many people said that meeting at sea would risk being caught in one fell swoop. It is expected that the US President and the British Prime Minister would never take such a risk. The US President has gone to his summer resort in Canada, and the British Prime Minister can also spend a few hours flying there. This would also avoid political speculation about the British Prime Minister setting foot on American soil, because the British Prime Minister has not left the borders of the British Empire. Many parties here are eager for a meeting between the leaders of the two countries, believing that this is the best thing for the two world leaders who are united to eradicate Hitlerism to have a face-to-face conversation and establish complete understanding.

United Press, Washington, July 1st: It is rumored that President Roosevelt's top army and navy advisors have left Washington. Secretary of the Navy Knox, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, Chief of Staff General Marshall, and Assistant Chief of Staff for Air Force Major General Arnold are all not in Washington. Knox left the capital by plane last Saturday to return to his home in Manchester, New Hampshire for a week's vacation. However, his current whereabouts are at York Harbor in Maine. It is learned that he did not go to Manchester, but arrived at York Harbor on Tuesday. After that, he inspected the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. It is learned that Knox is prepared to go to Manchester today. It is said that Admiral Stark has left Washington for vacation. The Navy Department does not know the whereabouts of General Marshall and Major General Arnold, but it is known that they are not here.

### Mussolini's Second Son Dies in Plane Crash

Haitong News Agency, Rome, July 7th: Mussolini's son, Bruno, died this morning at 10:30 near Pisa when his plane crashed during a test flight. Bruno was born in 1915.

### European War Aftertalks (7)(5) - An Eyewitness Account of Atlantic Convoying

The First Mate unexpectedly said, "Do you know how far we are from America?"

"I don't know, I'd guess about two thousand miles."

It turned out that in a convoy, no one except the captain knows their location.

The First Mate smiled, "Even closer, use your binoculars to look at that destroyer, you can see America seven miles away."

Looking through the binoculars, the destroyer was even closer. It had four smokestacks. Some old American destroyers had four smokestacks. The draft was quite deep, and sometimes when hit by waves, it would be submerged by thousands of tons of seawater and disappear. This was indeed an old American destroyer, coming to protect us. At this moment, wisps of green smoke appeared again, each turning into ships, speeding towards us. This rendezvous must have been decided a few days ago when we left Canada. At that time, we needed to report to the Admiralty, saying, "Convoy at such-and-such a location at noon on such-and-such day." They had indeed arrived here.

We were a slower transport convoy, and high-speed destroyers seemed to dance around us, welcoming us to the British side of the Atlantic. We now felt safe. Each of their bridges had submarine detectors, and the sterns had depth charge throwers, ready to launch at any time. Each had rapidly firing four-inch cannons and several anti-aircraft guns, manned by the world's most accurate gunners. I felt we really needed them. We were approaching the most dangerous place in the world. Until now, we only worried about submarines and raiding ships. From now on, we must also be wary of German long-range bombers.

We would rely entirely on the protection of these small destroyers from now on. Two of them were transferred from America, and the rest were British ships, plus one ambulance ship. If a ship in the convoy was hit by the enemy, the others could not stop to rescue it, because stopping the ships would make them good targets for planes and submarines. Therefore, the rescue work was the responsibility of the ambulance ship, which had doctors, an operating room, and a complete staff and medicines. Knowing that an ambulance ship was following us made us feel much safer.

Together with the escorting warships, we sailed eastward on the calm sea for three days, with the warm sun high in the North Atlantic sky, as if welcoming us. Canadian Air Force planes circled above us every day, sometimes descending as if to assure us of their protection, and then suddenly disappearing, flying far away to search for German raiding ships. Of course, this kind of weather was most welcome.

But good times don't last, and that kind of weather, is now gone. The fog rising from the Gulf of Newfoundland was our companion for two days. In any case, fog is always unpleasant, but in a convoy, it is more than just annoying. We advanced side by side in several columns, with very little distance between each column. The ships behind us were no more than two hundred yards away, and the ships on either side were also no more than two hundred yards away. During the two foggy days, the captain never left the bridge for a step.

Our foghorn sounded every fifteen minutes, all night long, and the ships on either side echoed each other. The ships further behind also answered, following the sound, but the thick fog wrapped around them, and their cries were like the wails of lost sheep.

Our cargo ship normally had a speed of fourteen knots per hour, but now it was crawling through the fog at a speed of just a few knots. I went to the engine room and saw that the chief engineer and his assistants were all unhappy.

The chief engineer angrily said, "I'd rather go alone. Our ship is fast, well-armed, and a lucky ship."

But experience has taught the Admiralty that ships sailing alone often find a comfortable resting place on the bottom of the Atlantic. These lonely ships are the easiest targets for submarines, planes, and raiding ships. Therefore, maintaining the lifeline to Britain is safest by convoying.

After passing the Strait of Canso, the North Atlantic suddenly experienced the most violent wind. The Atlantic has no seasons. What about in the spring? Snow fell for eight hours, followed by large hailstones, hitting the steel plates with the sound of machine guns.

On the morning of the fifth day, we were suddenly surprised. We saw black smoke swirling on the southeastern and western horizons. Were we about to stop? Was it a raiding ship? We stood on the deck and looked out. We saw that it was not just one, but two, three, four... many ships forming another convoy. They were joining our convoy, which would increase our strength and provide more thorough protection. There were a total of twenty-five ships, sailing majestically towards us, and soon they were following behind us. Thus, more than fifty ships formed the largest convoy crossing the Atlantic, continuing forward. I climbed the narrow iron ladder to the lookout post. As far as the eye could see, there were ships everywhere. Never in the history of shipping have there been so many ships advancing in such a column.

I thought of the valuable cargo carried on the ships. In Canada, the crew told me that the cargo we carried was worth two million dollars. This was perhaps the average amount carried by each ship, so the convoy, not counting the value of the ships themselves, was worth over one hundred million dollars. Of course, these goods cannot be calculated in terms of money. If we arrived safely at our destination, considering the lives saved, the blows dealt to Germany, and the blows against the German side, their value would be beyond calculation.

I climbed down the slippery ladder and breathed a sigh of relief when my feet touched the deck. I have never liked heights, and even looking down the well would make me dizzy. I walked to the stern of the ship and joined the gunners.

Two of them, wearing wool hats, tightly wrapped in fur-lined coats, and wearing warm boots, sat behind the four-inch cannons defending against submarines. The ammunition was placed behind them in a semicircle, a total of forty 35-pound cannons. On the other side was an iron box filled with smokeless gunpowder. Although it was raining, the clean cannons still gleamed.

One gunner smiled and said, "Since we left port, we haven't done anything except wipe the cannons." The gunners were very proud of their cannons. These cannons had a range of seven miles, and no submarine could withstand a hit.

An anti-aircraft gunner said to me, "These old blocks of steel are not worth laughing at. Let's take a look at our real treasure."

The Bofors anti-aircraft gun, the most sophisticated weapon for dealing with planes, was installed twenty feet behind the four-inch cannons. It fired one-pound shells and could simultaneously send eight shells into the barrel, then fire them separately, or automatically. If the work of loading bullets was agile, it could fire one hundred and twenty rounds per minute.

The gunner proudly said, "I can hit seagulls nine thousand feet high."

What about dive bombers?

"We'll always have a chance to see them. They will never easily let go of such a convoy."

What he said was true, but the Germans had to first find out the location we were passing through. We were doing our best to keep it a secret. No one except the captain knew the port we were heading to. Even he did not know when we first left Canada. He only knew the route to take, the latitude and longitude to maintain, and the port to sail to when he opened the sealed orders one day.

Since we left port, no radio telegram has been sent from that ship, and we are not allowed to use the radio. The radio operator listens to the radio for one hour every day at the specified wavelength. Sometimes he also gives us a little bit of news, mostly war news, but nothing important. I asked him to listen to baseball news, but he solemnly told me that he was not allowed to listen to any American radio stations. He said cautiously, "Old friend, why else would I not do it?"

Life on a cargo ship in a convoy is very different from life on a well-equipped, fast-moving ship in peacetime. We four passengers spent most of our time in the small dining room. Our life was just circling around two tables in the small room. We sat here learning patience and seclusion. We read detective novels and gently debated Hume and Lindbergh, Spain and Greece, sherry and cocktails, and did lifeboat drills every other day.

The lifeboat drills now cannot be as hasty as they were in peacetime. We put on our life jackets, brought canned food, and the steward gave each of us a bottle of wine, a few pieces of chocolate, and a can of cigarettes. He considerately gave me a can of American cigarettes. The crew wore life vests, which they put on like coats. The four of us passengers had old-fashioned cork life jackets. Now that we were with so many beautiful destroyers, no one felt uneasy.

The steward advised us, "Don't jump with your life jacket on. If you jump with it on, the life jacket will float up and hit your chin, knocking you unconscious."

I asked him, "Will these things float?"

He said loudly, "Will they float? Of course, they will. They can keep you afloat for eight or nine days without sinking. I have seen people pulled out of the sea who have been drifting for two weeks. Because they had life jackets on, they did not sink."

I asked him again, "What about those people? Are they still alive?"

The steward replied, as if annoyed, "They can't keep you alive, but they can at least keep you afloat." (To be continued)

### American Missionary Arrives in Shanghai from the Southwest: "China Cannot Be Subdued, Its Intrinsic Strength Is Enough to Overcome Everything, Striving Together for Final Victory"

Yesterday, a certain American missionary who came to Shanghai from Chengdu via Chongqing, Kunming, and Hong Kong spoke to a reporter from the New Life News Agency about his impressions of China's mountainous southwest. The missionary came to Shanghai from the United States a few years ago, stayed for several months, and then took the southwest route to the Chongqing and Chengdu areas at the beginning of this year. For half a year, he repeatedly traveled back and forth in the brave towns of the rear, inspecting church work, so he had a deep understanding of the people. Thus, he had a deep understanding of the character of the Chinese people during the war. What he talked about yesterday was a general narrative of his experiences in the past six months, which was eloquent and moving, and hearing it was like being there.

The Greater the Pain, the Deeper the Tempering

The missionary first stated, "Before I came to China, I never believed that China would leave such a deep impression on me. When I arrived in Shanghai a few years ago, I often received information from friends about the situation in the interior, but because I was afraid of having preconceived ideas, I was always half-believing and half-doubting. Now that I have personally experienced it and witnessed it with my own eyes, I feel that what my friends told me before is not even one ten-thousandth of the reality. The most indelible impression I got from traveling back and forth to the western and southwestern provinces of China was that 'there is absolutely no dismay there.' This is because the Chinese people clearly have a correct long-term vision, that is, the greater the pain they suffer and the deeper the tempering they receive, the more rapid and perfect the growth of the new China will be."

Resolute Atmosphere and Outstanding Spirit

"The free Chinese people, who are absolutely not dismayed, have established a new model on the vast territory of the interior. This model can be said to be unprecedented and unparalleled in the world, including a resolute atmosphere, diligent operation, outstanding spirit, and calm attitude. No matter how the environment changes, this model remains unchanged. Once, I was in Chongqing and happened to talk to a middle-aged male refugee who had lost his family and was displaced due to air raids. Although I was not familiar with Chinese, I was fortunate to have someone translate a little. Only then did I know that this unfortunate person never resented the war or the cruel bombing. Instead, it made him thoroughly understand that only by fighting to the end can this kind of pain and trouble be eliminated. His firm belief is something that those who have never been there cannot imagine. A few days later, I passed by this place again, but this refugee was no longer there. When I asked about him, I learned that he had gone to join the army."

Unanimous and Enthusiastic Support for the Leader

The Shanghai continued, stating that the people in the interior also have a common belief and respect, that is, unanimously supporting President Chiang Kai-shek as the sole leader of China, and believing that only under the leadership of President Chiang Kai-shek can the final victory be achieved. "Although I have never met President Chiang Kai-shek, I have always admired his great talent and strategy. He has led China in the war for so long. When I was in the interior, I personally experienced the Chinese people's respect for their leader and deeply understood that a leader loved by the people is essential to maintain the unity, strength, and independence of a country. The reason why several countries in this European war were easily subdued was that they lacked true leaders. I firmly believe that President Chiang Kai-shek is the embodiment of the Chinese national spirit and an undoubted symbol of China's bright future."

Bombing Failed to Destroy Chongqing

When the reporter later inquired about the bombing of Chongqing, he replied, "I don't want to use extremely trivial facts to blur the impression you have of free China, but in terms of air raids, what I can tell you is more consistent. I stayed in Chongqing for a week and encountered three air raids, and I took refuge in public or private air-raid shelters. I saw that the local people were unusually calm when they encountered air raids, entering the air-raid shelters in an orderly manner. After the air raid passed, the rescue team quickly dispatched people to send the injured to the hospital, and the rubble on the streets was immediately cleared. As for the firefighters, they bravely put out the fire in every raging fire, which is admirable. Although houses are often destroyed by bombing, the speed of their 'recovery' is amazing. In short, Chongqing cannot be destroyed by bombing. The more intense the bombing, the more complete the improvement of Chongqing will be."

Various Industries Are Constantly Progressing

Regarding the development of industry in the interior, the missionary stated in a firm tone, "Although I don't want to exaggerate the progress of Chinese industry too much, and I don't dare to expect too much, because China is not an industrial country, and it has no foundation in heavy industry. However, in the past few years of war, in order to increase the efficiency of self-sufficiency and self-reliance, the authorities have indeed had the intention of developing light and heavy industries. Although the current results cannot be compared with other industrial countries, it is proud enough to have made such progress in such a short period of time. Industries such as textiles, mining, steel, military industry, water conservancy, chemicals, and electrical engineering are all making significant progress. The widespread development of the industrial cooperation movement, with minimal capital, helps the development of light industry, which is enough to make China gradually embark on the road to industrialization."

Feeling Lucky to Work in China

Finally, the missionary smiled and said, "I have often heard my colleagues say that China is lovable. This statement, after personal experience, is definitely not a fabrication. China is not only lovable, but also worthy of emulation, because China truly has great internal strength. Once applied, its effectiveness will be extremely impressive. What I feel most fortunate about is that I have the opportunity to work in free China in this life, and today I have the opportunity to talk about my impressions of free China. China is truly a country full of hope. The most urgent responsibility at present is to strive together for victory." At this point, the reporter asked if he would return to the southwest again. He replied, "Yes, I will stay here for a few days. Once my public and private affairs are completed, I will take a sea route to Hong Kong and fly to Kunming. My future actions will be decided after arriving in Kunming."

### Japanese Deputy Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Council to Arrive in Shanghai Regularly

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, the newly appointed Japanese Deputy Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Public Concession Police Department, Mr. Watanabe Masaru, has decided to bring his wife, Tsuruko, and several family members on the Kobe Maru to Shanghai. The ship is scheduled to arrive on the 23rd of this month. Also, Mr. Okamoto Kazusaku, who returned to his country for business a few days ago, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru on the 9th.

### Japanese Soldier Falls into Huangpu River, American Ship Rescues Him, Japanese Minister of Aviation Thanks American Ship

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Japanese naval authorities disclosed last night (the 6th) that on the night of the 3rd of this month, a Japanese sailor fell into the Huangpu River from the Izumo Wharf while taking a small boat to the Jiangnan Shipyard. Fortunately, the gunboat USS Luzon immediately rescued him. According to reports, the sailor was Petty Officer First Class Shimomoto Takeshitoshi. At 10:00 p.m. on the 3rd, he was taking a regular boat to the Jiangnan Shipyard on official business. After five minutes, the boat was passing near the USS Luzon when Shimomoto accidentally fell into the river. The small boat immediately stopped to rescue him. Hearing the news, the crew of the USS Luzon immediately turned on searchlights to illuminate the river surface and dispatched a motorboat to carry out the rescue. At about 10:10 p.m., the Japanese soldier was pulled out and taken aboard the USS Luzon for medical treatment. The Japanese Navy Chief Petty Officer Harano Takeo, who was also on the small boat, also boarded the USS Luzon to express his gratitude and then helped Shimomoto back to the small boat. Afterwards, Japanese Navy Minister of Aviation Nakayama heard the news and visited Commander Bullock of the USS Luzon to formally express his gratitude.

### Concession Merchants Apply for Foreign Exchange, Must Be Approved by the Government, Chinese Banks Previously Buying and Selling Foreign Exchange, Central Bank Designated to Collect and Pay

After the US government announced the freezing of funds from China and Japan, in order to maintain legitimate import and export trade with China, the United Kingdom, the United States, South America, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies, general notices were issued, from No. 54 to No. 69, for a total of 16 notices. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from the four banks that the full text of the general notices was given to the Central Bank as No. 60, and to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China as No. 61. Among them, No. 59 was given to 14 friendly banks such as HSBC and Citibank, and No. 58 stipulated import and export trade with China (excluding the four northeastern provinces). The remaining notices had little to do with China. The following is a summary of the notices.

Regulations for Notices to the Four Banks

Notice No. 60 issued to the Central Bank stipulates that foreign exchange bought and sold by Chinese banks before July 26 will be collected and paid by the Central Bank, referring to the unfrozen portion. The deadline for the above-mentioned collection and payment is August 15. Notice No. 61 issued to the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China stipulates that these three banks are authorized to handle China's legitimate trade with the United States, but must be handled in accordance with the regulations stipulated in Notice No. 58. Applicants for foreign exchange must meet the following two conditions: (1) The trade must be a legitimate import or export, and the value of the imported or exported goods must be equivalent to the total amount of foreign exchange applied for. (2) The importer or exporter must meet all the terms of the general notice.

Notice for Applying for Legal Foreign Exchange

Since the Ministry of Finance announced the rules for applying for foreign exchange for imported goods, stipulating that the import of necessary goods, approved by the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee, will be sold at the official exchange rate by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. However, the applicant must pay a balancing fee based on the difference between the official price and the listed price of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. As for the export of local goods that are required to be settled in foreign exchange, the foreign exchange obtained must be sold to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications at the official exchange rate. After the exporter actually settles the foreign exchange amount, he can receive the difference between the official price and the listed price of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications with the settlement documents. Now, all importers and exporters in the free area have followed the above-mentioned methods. However, legitimate merchants in the Shanghai concession area who want to apply for legal foreign exchange must be specially approved by the Chinese government.

Strictly Review Black Market Calculations

Due to the special environment in the Shanghai concession area, the export goods that should be settled in foreign exchange with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have not followed Chinese laws and regulations. Luxury and semi-luxury goods with 234 tariff numbers that are prohibited from import by the Chinese government can still be declared for import. Therefore, the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have calculated the applications of importers to purchase foreign exchange according to the Shanghai black market exchange rate. As for the methods of supplying foreign exchange for necessary goods to legitimate merchants in the future, they are waiting for the Ministry of Finance to issue an order. Before the order is issued, for necessary goods such as rice, wheat, cotton, and coal, except for foreign exchange specially approved by the Chinese government at the official price, it must be strictly reviewed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications and sold at the black market exchange rate after being approved.

Temporary Notice from Chinese Banks

Yesterday, reporters from the New Life News Agency inquired from various Chinese banks (excluding the four banks of Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China) that operate foreign exchange business. Various Chinese banks that operate foreign exchange business, such as Shanghai Continental, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Industrial, Overseas Chinese, East Asia, Guohua, and China-South, have received a notice from the Central Bank yesterday that all foreign exchange bought and sold before July 26 will be exchanged by the Central Bank. All must be cleared and balanced by August 15. Now, all Chinese banks have followed the regulations. However, if they want to operate foreign exchange business in the future, they must apply to the Chinese government and ask the US Treasury Department to issue a temporary notice. They are only allowed to operate after obtaining a temporary notice.

### French Electric Workers Resumed Work Yesterday, Vehicles Fully Restored, All Precautions Completely Lifted During the Strike Period, Tram Communication Restored This Morning in Both Concessions

After the workers of the French Water and Electricity Company demanded an increase in subsidies and went on strike from the afternoon of August 4, through the efforts of the French Police Department's Political Department and others, an agreement was reached between the company's foreman and the workers. It was stipulated that (1) the worker bonus rules will be formulated and announced immediately; (2) starting from August, each person's wage will be increased by 19 yuan; (3) the two arrested workers, No. 62 and others, will be released immediately; (4) one day's wages will be deducted during the strike period. Workers in the machinery department resumed work in the factory on the evening of the 6th, and workers in the transportation department resumed work across the board on the morning of the 7th. As a result, all streetcars, trolleybuses, and buses on Route 21 and Route 22 in the French Concession were fully restored to operation. The armed patrol police sent by the French Police Department to protect the vehicles were withdrawn, and the precautions around the Lujiawan factory were also lifted. Everything returned to the situation before the strike. However, the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company of the British Concession and the French Water and Electricity Company of the French Concession will resume mutual communication of the seventeen, eighteen, twenty-four trolleybuses and the five streetcars from this morning.

### American Church in Hengyang Bombed Seven Times, Buildings Painted with National Flags, But Still Inevitably Bombed Repeatedly

According to the North China Daily News, the China General Council of the American Presbyterian Church received a telegram from Dr. Stirlingham, president of the Presbyterian Hospital in Hengyang, Hunan, on August 4, stating that "the president's house was partially destroyed by bombing today, everyone is safe." It is verified that the Presbyterian Church property in Hengyang has been damaged by bombing a total of seven times since November 1938. Three houses in a certain place in the city were bombed, and four houses in another place were bombed and damaged. The house that was bombed again on August 4 was hit by destructive bombs and incendiary bombs in the previous three attacks and was heavily damaged. Three residences, one school building, and several parts of the hospital of the church have been completely destroyed or half-destroyed. These buildings are all painted with large American flags in the hope of obtaining some protection, but they are still inevitably bombed repeatedly.

### Yantai Students Arrive in Shanghai This Morning, Just in Time to Catch the President Liner to America

Fourteen students from the China Inland Mission school in Yantai, along with a few adults from the school, are arriving in Shanghai today (the 8th) on a Taikoo Shipping Company vessel. Ten of the students have already booked tickets on the President Liner and will depart from Shanghai for America next week. The remaining four students will go to Australia. Because the Japanese authorities have imposed restrictions on foreigners leaving Yantai, people had doubted whether these students would be able to depart from that port and feared that the ten students would not be able to catch the President Liner to America. However, after negotiations between the British authorities and the Japanese, all the students were able to travel. The China Inland Mission school in Yantai started its summer vacation in August, and all the students, except for the fourteen who came to Shanghai, remained in Yantai.

### Seymour Road Vegetable Market to be Rented to the Public Works Department Again

According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the Public Works Department has extended its lease of the Seymour Road vegetable market from Sassoon & Co. for another year. The department is currently on summer vacation and will not resume operations until early September, so the renewal of the market lease has not been announced. However, this news has been confirmed by an official from the department. The lease extension is said to begin on September 1st. The specific terms of the renewal and the rental amount are not yet known. Sassoon & Co. had previously planned to convert the vegetable market into warehouses, but after discussions, they agreed to renew the lease with the Public Works Department.

### American Freighter Arrives in Shanghai Carrying a Batch of Mail

According to the English-language "China Press," the American Mail Line freighter "Cape Flattery" arrived here yesterday (the 6th) afternoon, carrying twenty-three bags of mail from the United States to Shanghai. It is reported that the ship originally carried over a hundred bags of mail, but when it arrived in Vancouver, Canada, it was stopped by central inspectors who seized eighty to ninety bags of mail, leaving only twenty-three bags to be carried to Shanghai. The ship's local management confirmed that mail had been seized, but they did not know the exact number or the reason. The "Cape Flattery" departed from Seattle, USA, on its maiden voyage, and the mail it carried was apparently seized by the authorities in Vancouver.

### Applicants for Student Aid Grants Interviewed at the Office in Recent Days; All Procedures to be Completed in About Ten Days; Yüan Yüan Rotary Club Aid

The work of investigating reader scholarship applications at this newspaper has recently been the most active and focused, aiming for quick results. In addition to assigning reporters for on-site visits, those who are located in the distant suburbs have already been notified by letter and scheduled for interviews. A total of forty-two students visited the office in the past two days. Reporters from this newspaper interviewed them separately, recorded details, and expect to complete the process within about ten days. The list of names will be published soon. Information about home visits has been disclosed successively since yesterday. These glimpses of hardship not only provide reference for readers, but their sweetness and bitterness are also meant to encourage the public.

Special Approval for Extension of Application Period

Yu Hua Middle School recently sent a letter to this newspaper, offering free places specially for new students entering the first, second, and third grades of junior and senior high school in the autumn, two students per grade, for a total of twelve students. This newspaper has specially approved a two-day extension of the application period. Although many people came to apply until last night, very few were found to be qualified. Out of respect for the school's intention and for the sake of poor scholars, the deadline has been extended for another five days, that is, from today until 6:00 PM on the 12th, to continue accepting applications. It is hoped that poor students residing near Foch Road and Chengdu Road, close to the school, will apply as soon as possible.

Enthusiastic Donations Yesterday

The following donations were received yesterday: 500 yuan from the members of the "Yüan" Yüan Rotary Club, 100 yuan from Fang Youqi Hall, 100 yuan from Yin Meisheng of Ningbo Southern Suburb, 100 yuan from the staff of the Foch Road branch of the Pudong Bank, 30 yuan from Chun He Xiang, 20 yuan from Zhao Guoping, 20 yuan from Mrs. Shen, 20 yuan from Zou Xichang, 10 yuan and 3 jiao 5 fen from the Tian Tong Primary School remedial class (saved from candy expenses), 9 yuan and 4 jiao 8 fen from Tang Jiquan of Shenxin Second Cotton Mill and his fundraising efforts, 5 yuan from Zhang Lianqing, 5 yuan from Li Renqing, and 5 yuan from Yao Chuantong, totaling 924 yuan 8 jiao 3 fen. Adding the previous balance of 28,908 yuan 5 jiao 6 fen, the total is 29,833 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen.

Rotary Club's Response Echoes

Since the members of the Rotary Club took the lead in generously donating 3,000 yuan and requested that all relevant clubs unanimously respond, the "Tongyüan" Yüan Yüan Friendship Society has heard the call and shown enthusiastic and righteous actions, which are especially valuable. Their letter states, "Your newspaper has launched a reader scholarship fund to benefit society and poor children, a truly significant achievement. Our society deeply admires your enthusiasm and hereby donates 500 yuan in response to the proposal of the gentlemen of the Rotary Club, hoping you will accept it with our respect."

### On-Site Visit Records of Scholarship Applicants (2)

Behind the Western-Style House

During my spare time from work, I took on the task of investigating scholarship applications. With full enthusiasm, braving the intense sun, and walking roads I rarely traveled, I searched for winding alleys to conduct investigations. As a result, what made me very gratified was that I came to know another side of society, discovered all kinds of families, saw lively students, encountered strange events, and gained a lot of experience.

The first person I started investigating was an eleven-year-old child living at the end of Avenue Joffre. The items filled on the form were in blue ink and the characters were not very neat, but in the grades section, to show how good his grades were, he filled it out with very conspicuous red ink. I took the investigation form and set off from home. After walking for more than half an hour through a lively street—Avenue Joffre—I finally found the alley where he lived. But when I arrived at my destination, I was stunned. The width and smoothness of this alley, the magnificence of the houses, was simply the best residential area in Shanghai. I wondered, could the children living in such a residential area still need to apply for scholarships? But since I was already here, I had to go in and take a look. Unexpectedly, the door number he wrote was nowhere to be found. There was no way, so I had to return to the entrance of the alley and ask the gatekeeper of the alley, "Number 15? Go that way." With a contemptuous expression, the gatekeeper pointed to the side alley inside. I got the instruction and followed the track. Strangely, from the side alley, it turned out to be a rural mud road. Both sides of the mud road were empty. After walking along this mud road, I found a door number written in ink—number 15—. The houses there were bungalows. Compared with the splendid houses, it was truly like heaven and earth, not to be mentioned in the same breath. What was considered fortunate was that the door number was connected to the door number of the splendid house. At that time, a lively child, with a surprised and happy look, came with a smiling face. I asked him, is there a little brother ×××? He just said "yes", blushing, lowered his head, and hurriedly led me into a dilapidated house. The furnishings inside were like those in the countryside. Apart from bamboo beds, bamboo chairs, and bamboo tables, there was nothing else. At that time, I realized that the little brother I wanted to visit was himself. He felt that I had discovered it too late and said very innocently, "I just got a haircut today, so I don't look like the photo very much." I asked him about his family situation in detail. He answered very cleverly and thoroughly. It turned out that his father had passed away, and his only relative was his brother, but he was far away in Chongqing. The family's finances were painstakingly managed by his widowed mother, and the situation was indeed very difficult. One more point worth mentioning is that this little brother's school is far away on Route Say Zoong, and the distance from his home occupies more than a thousand door numbers on Avenue Joffre. According to him, except for when it rains and he sometimes takes the tram, he always walks to school when the weather is clear. Such a spirit of seeking knowledge is truly worthy of our reward and assistance. I got a satisfactory result and proceeded to the second visit. (C)

### More Than a Dozen Bandit Chiefs Repeatedly Commit Kidnappings in the French Concession; More Than Ten Cases of Kidnapping, Murder, and Robbery

Song Bingzheng and Yang Xiguang, Chinese detectives from the Public Works Department's Criminal Investigation Division, previously apprehended bandit chiefs Xu Jinsheng, Pan Liansheng, Sun Yulou, Liu Gaofu, Wang Huanan, Geng Yuting, Wang Zhaofu, Liu Zhiqing, Chen Yushan, Wu Yueqing, Qiu Binghua, Shen Genfu, Liu Shunzhi, as well as women Liu Fan and Wang Jindi.

### Bombing at Bao Da Xiang Kills One Person

At 3:00 PM on the 6th, a bomb was thrown into Bao Da Xiang cotton cloth shop at No. 16, Route Cardinal Mercier, falling and exploding among the counters in the shop. Five shop employees were injured, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. One of the five injured, Zhe Houxing (33 years old, from Ningbo), was seriously injured in the abdomen and died at Guangci Hospital despite treatment at 11:00 PM that night. The body was sent to the coroner's office. Yesterday, the shop's assistant manager, Chai Li, arrived to claim the body and transported it to the Dazhong Funeral Home for embalming. His family is still in his hometown and has been notified by telegram. The shop will provide generous compensation. It is reported that there are still others being treated in the hospital with varying degrees of injury.

### Car Robbed in Front of Cathay Theater

At around 9:00 PM last night, a person arrived in a private car (No. 11204) to watch a movie at the Cathay Theater on Avenue Joffre and Route Mayers. The car was parked in front of the Cathay Theater, and the driver was sleeping in the car. Suddenly, four bandits came, two of them brandishing pistols, rushed to the front of the car, and intimidated the driver. The driver woke up from his dream, saw the pistols, and dared not resist. The bandits drove the driver out of the car, got into the car one after another, accelerated, and drove northward without a trace. Afterwards, the driver reported to the French police and requested an investigation.

### Husband Favors Concubine and Bullies Wife, Beats Wife to Death

A case of a husband beating his wife to death occurred on Route Doolittle in the French Concession the day before yesterday evening. A Ningbo man named He Xingsheng, who worked as a chauffeur for a certain family, had a wife named Shen (41 years old), also from Ningbo. He then married a Changshu woman named Chen (38 years old) as his concubine. He, his wife, and his concubine lived together at No. 41, Route Doolittle. However, living together in the same house inevitably led to disputes. Unexpectedly, He favored his concubine and bullied his wife, often mistreating her. At 11:45 PM the night before last, the two women, Shen and Chen, quarreled again over a trivial matter, and then turned to violence. He did not ask right from wrong, but immediately beat Shen severely with a wooden stick, and accidentally beat Chen to death in the room. He, seeing that the corpse would cause trouble, immediately fled without a trace. Chen fled more slowly and was grabbed by a co-resident, who reported to the police, who took Chen to the police station and sent the deceased Shen's body to the coroner's office for examination.

### Lantern Slide Advertising Dispute: Li Songshou Found Not Guilty

Li Songshou, a local merchant, planned to contract the lantern slide advertising for the Tianchan Stage, Gong Stage, and Da Stage in May of this year. While he was in negotiations, Lin Sheng of the Yindu Advertising Company at No. 1311, Museum Road, asked his friend Gu Changgan to request Li to subcontract this advertising to them. A contract was signed in mid-June, with a prepayment of half a month's fee, totaling 2,500 yuan, and it was agreed that screenings would begin in July. When the time came, Li requested a postponement because the negotiations had not been fully completed. At that time, Yindu agreed to a one-month postponement, and screenings were to begin in August. Unexpectedly, Yindu suddenly broke the contract on the 10th of last month and demanded the return of the prepayment. Li believed that the matter was about to be completed, but there was this sudden reversal, and the losses he suffered would be very large, so he ignored it. On the 20th of last month, Yindu, using the excuse that Li "defrauded 2,500 yuan under the pretext of advertising," reported to the police, and Li was arrested by the Laozha Police Station. The next morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 5 of the Special First District Court for questioning. The police lawyer stated the above process and requested a postponement of the investigation and further interrogation because the truth of the case was unclear. The court, according to the situation, ordered Li to be released on bail pending trial. Li believed that this matter was close to slander, so he hired lawyers Wang Yaotang and Ping Heng to appear in court to defend him. Now that the trial has been completed, Li Songshou was found not guilty yesterday morning.

The rate for British pounds was reduced by 0.03125, totaling three shillings and 0.03125. The rate for US dollars was reduced by 0.0625, totaling five yuan and 0.0625. There was no market for French, German, or Japanese currency, and the rates for other currencies also decreased accordingly. The black market for British and American currencies remained tight, but there were many sellers mid-course. Chinese merchants, Sichuan gangs, and importers scrambled to buy. Foreign banks were very reluctant to supply. It was also heard that HSBC's small counters had reduced the US exchange rate by 0.0625 to five yuan, so it also softened to five yuan and 0.03125, making it difficult to settle. British gold at three shillings and 0.03125 was also difficult to obtain at one point. However, after 10:30 AM, speculators saw the high prices and began to sell, needing five yuan and 0.0625. There were also rumors of conflict between Japan and Thailand and the United States unfreezing funds in the Far East. The US dollar could be settled at five yuan and 0.0625 at noon. In the afternoon, there was talk of peace between England and Germany, and Sassoon came to buy settlements. Importers settled a lot, and speculators came back to scramble, so the situation became tighter again in stability, and finally squeezed again. The whole day's transaction was quite active.

HSBC Hangs Uniformly Reduced

Since the morning, the Leiyin market's daily rules were uniquely reduced, with US and Indian exchange rates remaining flat. The exchange rate of British currency against Shanghai currency was reduced by 0.02125, while the rest remained flat. The officially posted rates of the Central Bank did not change. The bank's selling price was heard early in the internal market, with the spot rate for British gold at three shillings and 0.046875, and the rate for US dollars remaining flat at five yuan and 0.09375. After the opening, the trend weakened amid the double buying frenzy of speculators and importers. The Sichuan gang bought US dollars for August at five yuan and 0.0625, and the HSBC rate was uniformly reduced. The silver balance tax was lowered by 0.25, totaling 24.25%. HSBC's small counters reduced the US exchange rate to five yuan, and the banks' willingness to supply was even lower. Two foreign banks mutually traded August futures at five yuan and 0.02225, but only settled at five yuan. Until 10:30 AM, rumors of negative news suddenly arose, and speculators came to sell, needing five yuan and 0.0615 in August. Moreover, there were also reports of British currency fleeing from Hong Kong and rumors from Lei, so by noon, it had hardened to the point where the US dollar could be settled at five yuan and 0.0625, and British gold at three shillings and 0.03125.

Sassoon Also Buys August Futures

In the afternoon, importers were even more courageous in buying settlements. Sassoon settled and bought August at five yuan and 0.0625. Speculators came to scramble for settlements again, but only at US five yuan and 0.03125. The market situation was slightly weakening in stability. The British exchange rate tightened accordingly, and the transaction became sparse.

### Rumors Abound, Gold Market Uneasy

Yesterday's black market for gold was dominated by rumors, fluctuating repeatedly. First, it rose, nearing the strict barrier of 6,900 yuan, then it fell sharply, retreating to the border of 6,800 yuan, and then it presented a roundabout situation. According to what people on all sides said, it was generally leaning upwards, because both the official and black markets for foreign exchange were tight. Since the opening in the morning, it has been heard that foreign exchange is tight, banks have little willingness to supply, and in the buying wind of gold shops, securities gangs, exchange dealers, and retail investors, it once rose gradually from 6,810 yuan to 6,892 yuan. After reaching 10:30, a reverse wind suddenly rose, because the Shanghai West gang supplied more than was demanded, and Yiyuan sold out. There were also rumors of a conflict between Japan and Thailand and the United States unfreezing funds in the Far East. Exchange dealers and securities firms also came to resell, and it once fell sharply to 6,810 yuan. In the afternoon, there was talk of peace between England and Germany, and foreign exchange continued to tighten, but large long positions sold out at high prices, and a profit-taking trend appeared again. Therefore, it was raised several times and then fell back, finally squeezing up 17 yuan. There was an 82 yuan difference on the day. After the close, it rose again to 6,860 yuan. More than 100,000 taels were traded throughout the day. The spot price first rose and then returned. Chengji sold 30 taels, and Mingfeng sold 20 taels, all bought by Junhengji. Defu Jinyi bought 50 taels, and Xiangxing Yongjin bought 50 taels, all at 8,600 yuan, an unprecedented high price. Later, Tong Kangrun sold 20 taels of Defu at 8,585 yuan, sold 160 taels of Defu at 8,580 yuan. In the afternoon, Taikangrun sold 100 taels of Defu, priced at 8,590 yuan. Fang Jiuxia sold 20 taels of Yang Qinghe for 8,560 yuan, with buyers at 8,570 yuan at the end.

### Spot US Dollar Tickets Suddenly Higher Than Futures Yesterday

Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets continued to rise, the former reaching 2 yuan and 3 jiao, and the latter rising to 1 yuan and 8 jiao.

### Securities: Class A Approaching Lottery; Market Turns Sluggish

The black market for public bonds yesterday fell because many parties were unable to raise the price and instead sold off. The previous four-day winning streak did not excite people, but only raised the price due to short covering. On the one hand, long positions came out in droves. There was no significant change in the environment, but it was still brewing and waiting for change. Class A is approaching the lottery, and the market suddenly appears sluggish, because, due to the lottery relationship, most of the bullish focus is concentrated on this. Now, because its benefits are limited, it has shifted its focus to Class B. Therefore, various bonds are falling, Class A is uniquely soft, and Class B is uniquely firm. Speculators have no chance to take advantage of, so there is this boring move. When Class B is approaching the lottery, they will abandon B and enter C. This method, although quite clever, often backfires. Yesterday's transactions saw Yichang, Dahua, Xinhua, and Gongmao slightly buy in and cover shorts in the morning, while Lianhe, Changji, Dafeng, Yongchang, Runde, and Yuxing either cut longs or turned short. The market price was stagnant, with very little fluctuation. In the afternoon, Lianhe and Yu Ji continued to sell, and Hongda also sold quite a bit, and Xinchang also resold. Xieda, Runying, Jiufeng, and Xinhua slightly bought in, and the trend gradually weakened. Class C broke the 8 yuan mark again. Class A gradually weakened due to Changji's sale. As a result, they all slightly returned down by one or four jiao, and a total of 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan were transacted. A brief table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 100 shares of Kenye Bank stock were traded, with the price being 82 yuan.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange reported that the stock market trend was very erratic. Due to rumors, prices fell sharply at one time at noon, and showed stability slightly in the afternoon, but the stock market also weakened at closing.

London 6th (3rd) Electric, today's list of stocks of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British merchants are stagnated, and the market has no change.

### Grain: Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai in the Past Seven Months: 3,684,000 Bags, More Than Enough to Feed the People, a Sensation Yesterday but Returning to Calm

Because the source of domestic rice is scarce, the citizens of this city mostly rely on foreign rice for their food supply. The import of foreign rice has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. According to investigations, the amount of foreign rice that arrived in Shanghai last month (July) was a huge 661,483 bags. Among them, 77,377 bags were directly transported from Siam (Thailand), 176,934 bags were directly transported from Cochinchina (Vietnam), 74,150 bags were directly loaded from Rangoon (Myanmar), and 59,500 bags were directly loaded from Java (Dutch East Indies). The remaining 379,522 bags were transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai, most of which were low-priced, small-grain foreign rice from the Public Works Department. It is found that in the first half of the year, from January to June, a total of 3,022,679 bags of foreign rice arrived, among which March was the most, with a total of 687,410 bags. Moreover, in July, the first month of the second half of the year, there were also more than 660,000 bags. In the past seven months of this year, a total of 3,684,162 bags of foreign rice have arrived in Shanghai. Compared with the consumption of the people, there is more than half of the surplus. Therefore, it is estimated that the stock of foreign rice is sufficient, and there is absolutely no reason to panic. (Zu)

Yesterday, the foreign rice market was still in a fluctuating state. Both spot and futures prices rose in unison. The market was still stable at the opening in the morning. Subsequently, customers took advantage of the low prices to stock up. Moreover, it was rumored in the market that there would be no more foreign exchange for the continued import of low-priced Hong Kong-Vietnam rice, and people became even more nervous. The "scalper gang" and "cornering gang" took advantage of this chaos to vigorously promote their interests. The market gradually tightened, and prices were gradually driven up. The spot price of small-grain rice rose from 119.5 yuan to 110.5 yuan. Ngat P’o rice rose from 127 yuan to 128.5 yuan, and then to a high of 131 yuan to 134 yuan. Broken rice also rose from 90-odd yuan to 94 yuan. The small-grain rice of China-British Trading Company rose from 119 yuan to 149.5 yuan. No. 2 Siamese rice rose from 140 yuan to 140 yuan and 8 jiao, while regular rice was at 138 yuan and 8 jiao, and small-grain regular rice was at 147 yuan. No. 1 Saigon rice was at 148 yuan, an increase of 1 to 2-3 yuan compared to the previous market. However, after the price increase, those who had made profits came out to sell, and most of the rumors in the market were proved to be untrue by facts. Therefore, the price dropped back by a few jiao to two yuan. As a result, it only rose by about one yuan to nearly two yuan compared to the previous day. No. 1 Saigon rice was still at 131 yuan to 129.5 yuan, No. 2 was at 122-3 yuan and 120 yuan and 5 jiao, special Siamese rice was at 140 yuan, No. 2 Siamese rice was at 120 yuan and 5 jiao, rising to 122 yuan, special Min-tang rice was at 110-odd yuan, Zhongguan rice was at 126-7 yuan, regular rice was at 123-4 yuan, Ngat P’o rice was at 128 yuan and 2 jiao, and 128 yuan, bank warehouse small-grain rice was at 121 yuan, and outside warehouse white rice was at 110 yuan and 119.5 yuan. Tokyo polished rice was at 114 yuan and 112.5 yuan, rice chaff was at 112 yuan, and broken rice rose from 94.5 yuan to 91 yuan.

Thick and Thin Japonica Rice: The market for domestic rice and glutinous rice was reported to be flat yesterday, without much fluctuation. However, due to the retail demand from local stores and food vendors, seeing the foreign rice market tightening, they became more active. And the sellers' intention to sell became firmer, and they no longer sold easily. Therefore, the market for both was able to hold on and did not change. The selling price was the same as before. Fresh early and late indica rice from Nangang was still at 119.5 yuan to 117 yuan. Wuxi original-packaged white japonica rice was at 144 yuan, and Hong Kong rice rose from 100 yuan to 114.5 yuan, and 123.5 yuan. Regular rice was at 118 yuan until the old crop, and glutinous rice chaff was at 113 yuan to 110 yuan, and domestic yuan rice was at 126 yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton Yarn: Although Hong Kong Demand is Strong, Double Horse Yarn Fails to Rise Because the Factories are Loosening Their Grip

The yarn market is still in a state of hesitation, with nothing exciting to report. However, the Hong Kong gang has a strong demand for 32-count single yarn and 42-count thread, and the market price has jumped by a huge 60-70 yuan. However, the trading of 20-count Double Horse yarn has decreased. Yesterday, 1,825 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and miscellaneous brand yarn also saw an increase. Therefore, the bid prices were frequently reported to be rising, and the foreign exchange rate was reduced. The speculative target, Double Horse yarn, failed to rise accordingly. Another saying is that the industry insiders are not optimistic about the current situation, so they are taking a short position. The reason is that the factories are loosening their grip and are willing to sell. Therefore, the intention to go long on Double Horse yarn is weak. The high price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,580 yuan, and the low price was 1,568 yuan. The initial trade in the afternoon was 1,568 yuan, rising to 1,570-odd yuan, then loosening to 1,564 yuan. The final price was 1,561 yuan. The current yarn market is still hovering. Considering the raw materials, the market should not be weak, but the people's sentiment is depressed and lacks energy. However, the selling price of Japanese yarn is quite firm.

The opening of the Double Horse yarn market in the morning was still good. The opening price was 1,580 yuan. After this price was opened, buyers did not rush to buy. After a while, it fell to 1,577 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the bid price had risen sharply, and a new high price was discovered. People's sentiment became high, and it rose to 1,582 yuan. Before long, it loosened again, twice reaching 1,580 yuan and then falling back. Then, customers bought a large amount of 32-count single yarn, causing the selling price to soar. However, the sellers remained indifferent, because the trading of 20-count yarn was not prosperous, and most of the industry insiders were selling. By the close of the market, it fell back to 1,568 yuan. According to the statistics of the day's turnover, 6,950 bales were traded. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong: 450, fellow traders: 6,500, total: 6,950

The situation of the Jinbian Horse futures yarn market was that, at the opening of the market in the morning, the price of American cotton rose while the price of Indian cotton fell, and people's sentiment was mixed. In the near term, short positions were covered, and the August contract rose by 2 yuan. Long positions were closed in the September contract, and it fell by 2 yuan. The October contract fell by 3.5 yuan. After the opening, it was heard that the demand for fine yarn from the Hong Kong gang was not bad, and new purchases and short covering increased slightly. The August contract rose to a high of 1,457 yuan, the September contract was at 1,528 yuan, and the October contract was at 1,542 yuan. Later, due to the lack of optimism about the international situation, long positions continued to sell at high prices, and the price turned downward. The afternoon closing saw the August contract fall by 4.5 yuan, the September contract fall by 5.5 yuan, and the October contract fall by 7-9.5 yuan. The turnover was 5,910 bales. The trend of the market slightly turned. The price of each month's contract rebounded by half a yuan to four yuan. The evening closing result was that the August contract fell by 3.5 yuan compared to the previous day, the May contract fell by 5 yuan, and the October contract fell by 3.5 yuan. A total of 9,330 bales were traded throughout the day, a decrease of 260 bales compared to the previous day. Furthermore, as of the 6th, the number of outstanding accounts for the three months was 31,850 bales, of which 8,580 bales were for the August contract, 12,510 bales were for the September contract, and 10,730 bales were for the October contract. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the whole day are recorded on the left (net disk quotation).

### Continued Transactions in Brazilian Cotton Orders

The current cotton situation is that prices are high and there are few buyers, because the factories' demand is not strong. However, in reality, cotton prices are difficult to loosen, so most of those who hold spot goods are deeply hidden and do not sell. As a result, the market has become stagnant and firm, with no movement.

Another report is that the trading of foreign cotton orders by foreign firms in Shanghai is slightly active, and the purchase of some cotton grades by the companies is also not weak. Recently, because the selling price of spot Brazilian cotton in the market is above 510 yuan, while if you order directly, the futures that will be shipped to Shanghai are only about 480-90 yuan. Therefore, a few factories and fellow traders are quite happy to order.

### Miscellaneous Grains: First Batch of New Soybeans Arrived

The new seedling beans have already been launched. Yesterday, the first batch of 140 bags of Changzhou bullhide green soybeans were transported here. The quality is quite good. It is said that the harvest in the producing area this year is very good, about 80% or more. Unfortunately, due to the frequent and difficult transportation, the price is not easy to be low, and the selling price is 52 yuan per load. Other supply and demand are still flat, and the situation is stable. The total market transaction of Tianjin Jinyuan soybeans was more than 1,000 loads, and the price was 46 yuan to 45.5 yuan. 150 bags of Qingdao soybeans were priced at 50 yuan and 5 jiao. 100 bags of Qingkou soybeans were priced at 49.5 yuan. 700 bags of Guide soybeans were priced at 48.6 yuan to 48.2 yuan.

On the 7th, 1,950 bags of beans and 1,330 pieces of bean cake were exported to Hong Kong.

### Grain Market: Grain Market Closed in the Afternoon - Because of Rumors of Interrupted Supply

Yesterday, because of rumors that Dutch sugar imports to Shanghai had been suspended, people's sentiment suddenly flourished, and prices rose like a rocket. Later, because the rise was too tight, it was announced that the market would be closed in the afternoon. The futures for coarse white sugar from the company for delivery on August 10th initially rose from 103 yuan and 2 jiao to 4 yuan and 5 yuan, then jumped to 109 yuan, an increase of 6 yuan and 2 jiao. For delivery on the 20th, it rose from 104 yuan and 8 jiao to 5 yuan and 6 jiao, and then to 7 yuan and 6 jiao, reaching a high of 12 yuan before the market closed, an increase of 8 yuan and 8 jiao. The spot price for the previous month was 105 yuan and 5 jiao to 7 yuan and 5 jiao, and 11 yuan and 2 jiao, then slightly dropped back to 9 yuan and 3 jiao, an increase of 5 yuan and 1 jiao. For delivery in June, it was 104 yuan and 5 jiao to 6 yuan and 5 jiao, 12 yuan, and then back to 9 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan and 3 jiao. For delivery in May, it was 103 yuan and 5 jiao to 5 yuan and 5 jiao, and 8 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan and 5 jiao. Sugar for July was 102 yuan and 5 jiao to 7 yuan and 3 jiao. Taikoo granulated white B mark was at 135 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan, HM mark was at 115 yuan, H mark crude red was at 88 yuan, and Dutch red was at 88.5 yuan to 90 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to a high of 90-8 yuan. This factory's crystal sugar was at 143-9 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan, and Jingming crystal sugar was at 145 yuan, also an increase of 8 yuan.

### Hardware: Local Nails See a Unique Rebound

The hardware market has been quite calm recently, mostly affected by the customs' ban on exports. People's sentiment is difficult to be high, so the prices of various goods are also difficult to rise again. Moreover, the daily turnover is not large, so the market atmosphere is quiet. The prices of various goods are generally stable, except for local nails, which rebounded yesterday due to the excessive price drop in the previous days. The price is now 5 yuan higher than the previous price of 175 yuan, and the current selling price is 180 yuan. The market price of foreign nails (i.e., imported goods manufactured in the United States) is 5 yuan more expensive than local nails. Yesterday, the price of each bucket of base metal was 185 yuan.

(Chongqing News Agency) In order to rapidly popularize compulsory education, the Ministry of Education has formulated and promulgated measures for adding children's compulsory supplementary classes to elementary schools for implementation. The full text is as follows: (1) In order to rapidly popularize compulsory education, enable out-of-school children to receive education, and allow in-school children to gain more beneficial friends, thereby improving the national level, the Ministry of Education has formulated measures for adding children's compulsory supplementary classes (hereinafter referred to as supplementary classes) to elementary schools. (2) In addition to enriching the number of students and fully setting up short-term elementary school classes, all elementary schools should set up supplementary classes to encourage in-school children to each bring at least one nearby child of school age who is still out of school to attend classes at the school during the designated period each week. (3) The class time for supplementary classes is set for Wednesday and Saturday afternoons or Sunday mornings. At ordinary times, the school arranges homework and self-study at home. The self-study time is two hours per day. (4) The organization of supplementary classes should be graded according to the level of study. Each grade should be divided into groups, with each group consisting of seven to ten people. (5) In addition to direct teaching by teachers, supplementary classes should also train outstanding children who are originally in the school to be mentors for each group, assisting the children in each group to study at school and regularly going to their homes to guide self-study. (6) The study period for supplementary classes is based on completing the one-year or two-year short-term elementary school curriculum. Upon completion of the study period and passing the examination, a certificate will be issued by the Compulsory Education Committee of each county and city. The outstanding students should be supplemented into the original equivalent grade of the school as formal students at any time, so that they have the opportunity for further study. (7) Children entering supplementary classes are exempt from all fees. Their school supplies are borrowed from the school or from the children who are originally in the school, or are issued by the school. (8) Each school should fully train the children who are originally in the school and must not discriminate against the children in supplementary classes, and should provide assistance such as guidance to complete their studies and borrowing school supplies. (9) When children in supplementary classes are attending classes at the school, each school should make full use of the school's spare grounds, and the mentors should lead the learning in groups, and teachers should guide them on a rotating basis. If the number of people is too large on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons and the space is not enough, the original elementary school formal classes of the school may be suspended as appropriate to borrow their classrooms. However, the designated mentors in the suspended classes must still attend school. (10) Teachers who are responsible for teaching supplementary classes should be given a salary increase according to the amount of time they spend teaching. (11) These measures will be implemented after being announced by the Ministry of Education.

### Chinese Representatives Selected for Tomorrow's Robert Cup

Meili Shiguiya Labor Shuo

The 1941 Shanghai International Tennis Robert Cup Doubles Championship will feature five countries: China, the United States, Portugal, Japan, and other countries. In the first week, Portugal, England, and Japan will all have byes. Only China and the United States will compete against each other. It is scheduled to start at 5:00 PM tomorrow (9th) at the Association Stadium on Xiahfei Road. The United States was the defending champion last year. This summer, due to the return of the main player Carson to the United States, its strength has plummeted. This year, the American team is having difficulty finding talent. Therefore, in addition to Smith still being selected, the veteran General Robert has been brought in to partner with Smith. Robert is currently a priest at the American Church in Nanjing. He was also a formidable player 14-15 years ago. In his prime, he had defeated famous players such as Lin Baohua and Huite. The Chinese side originally recommended Wang Wenzheng and Lin Baohua, two national players, but because Baohua is far away in Tianjin, after consideration by the selection authority, it was decided to select Wang Wenzheng and Li Guofan as the official representatives of the Chinese team for this year. Liang Baokui was also selected as a reserve player. The strength of the American team this year is not strong, so it may be possible to give Shi Kui a chance to allow Wang Wenzheng to conserve his energy.

### A Shocking Female Landlady - One Hundred and Eight People Upstairs and Downstairs; Mother Night Fury Creates Havoc

— Fei Zi

That day was July 28th, a Monday. An unprecedented commotion erupted in the first alley of ×× Road, Baike Road. People surged out like a tide, then rushed back in, crying and cursing, adults and children all mixed together.

Some thought someone had died? Others thought there was a fire?

Little did they know, it was a shocking "second landlord" story! It made passersby stick out their tongues.

The house in question was number ××, ×× Road, an old building with an upper and lower floor. The second landlord was a couple around fifty years old. The man looked quite weak, but the woman was a thorough "Mother Night Fury" character. She was short, with a snail-shell-curved body, half pockmarked, with bulging eyes - utterly "evil-looking"!

It is said that she started her career as a second landlord by first controlling the main landlord. Everyone knew that the main landlord of ×× Road was also a vicious character, always making trouble for the tenants with "rent increases," "recoveries," and "revisions." Only this Night Fury had never had a single hair plucked from her, the rent remained at eighty-eight yuan, and she even owed seven months of it, only paying for December of last year this month!

Believe it or not, her house was home to twenty-seven families, a total of one hundred and eight people, the same number as the Liangshan heroes. Ten of them were entire families, and the rest were all "bachelors."

The allocation of the house was as follows:

One family each in the front building, "middle building," and back building; one family each in the front and back living rooms; one family in the attic; one family in the "back kitchen lean-to"; two families on the third floor mezzanine; and she herself lived in a tin-skinned villa in the courtyard.

A row of bunk beds, two feet high, was built in the corridor, which became the "bachelors'" residence.

Decorating the house were twenty coal stoves, a dozen chamber pots, a dozen bedpans, the coal gas from the mouths of one hundred and eight people, the smell of sweat from their bodies, and more than one hundred thousand bedbugs!

Mother Night Fury's management of the tenants was known for its "ruthlessness." Electricity was limited to five-candlepower bulbs, and tap water was cut off at eight o'clock.

As for the rent, two months' rent was collected in advance, three months' rent as a deposit, payment in advance, and living after payment. All the other "treasures" of second landlords were thoroughly memorized. Rent had already been increased three times in two years. It is estimated that her current income is five hundred and eighty-five yuan per month.

This time, she launched another rent increase of forty percent. "The bachelor's bunk beds will be increased by three yuan each." She estimated that her monthly profit would be no less than seven hundred yuan.

As a result, the tenants fought back, demanding that the order be rescinded. Little did they know, she went all out, suddenly acting like Sun Wukong wreaking havoc in the Heavenly Palace. She took off her underwear and rolled around on the ground repeatedly, frightening a group of female tenants who screamed and desperately ran into their rooms and out of the house.

Don't look down on this trick: this trick had once scared away the rental agent and defeated the police officer. This trick proved that she was determined about this matter and would not change her mind.

The tenants stared at each other, seeing this scene, was submission inevitable?

I don't want to investigate the crimes of the second landlord, I just want to ask:

Such a small house, housing so many people, what will happen if an infectious disease breaks out? What if there is a fire?

### An Irrelevant Answer

— Huan Jun

Elementary school student (carefully calculating a word problem): Teacher! If one dan of white rice costs twelve yuan, one dan of coal briquettes costs ninety cents, and ten jin of soy sauce costs one yuan and fifty cents, the total is only fourteen yuan and forty cents, right?

Teacher: (with emotion) Now you can't buy things so cheaply.

Child: Dad! I'm so thirsty, I can't even get plain water. The Mao family next door eats a watermelon every day.

Father: Then go talk to Xiao Mao and ask him to give us the watermelon rinds they have left over every day to eat with congee, since vegetables are so expensive.

Dancer A: Some people say that dancers are the second coming of rickshaw pullers, but that's an underestimation of us.

Dancer B: That's right! Rickshaw pullers rarely pull people across the water, but we "drag people into the water" every day.

### Random Thoughts

— Zi Yang

Youth: Just like a climax on stage, if you don't seize it, the whole play will be overshadowed.

Youth: It's about being active, hardworking, joyful, and healthy.

### "Physiognomy"

— Jue Hui

Generally, wealth, honor, life, death, fortune, and misfortune all depend on whether one's "physiognomy" is good or not. If it's good, everything goes smoothly; if it's not good, nine times out of ten you'll be unlucky until you "rest in peace."

Opinions differ on the standards of "physiognomy," but it seems that no one has ever "legalized" them. Let's look at the following:

Some people advocate judging people by their appearance. As long as the forehead is full and the chin is round, it can be determined as a sign of good fortune and longevity; if not, hands reaching past the knees and the five mountains facing the heavens are necessary. If necessary, one can impersonate an "emperor." It's possible that those with big spleens may not be able to "see through" things.

Others advocate judging people by their clothes. As long as the eye is touched, and it can produce a fluttering feeling, then no matter if their appearance is mediocre or outstanding, they must be assigned to the "noble house"!

In the past, the former had the advantage; now, the latter is quite successful.

For example, if I am a "bare egg," no one will ever appreciate my "outfit"; if I go to a fortune teller, the fortune teller rolls his eyes at me and says, "Rotten wood cannot be carved!" and so on.

### Impressions of the Weiguang Sanatorium

— Zheng

Excellent Medical Skills and Attentive Care; Beautiful Environment and Hygienic Food; The Only Paradise for Treatment and Smoking Cessation

Weiguang Hospital, located at No. 21 Siming Lane, at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Luban Road, has gained a reputation since it adopted the "An Di Du Jing" special drug for smoking cessation invented by Dr. Li Weiguang of the hospital, which specializes in treating opium, morphine, heroin, and other addictive drugs. Those seeking treatment come in droves. In order to expand its services and meet social needs, the hospital has invested heavily and opened a sanatorium on Fukaissen Road. I visited it yesterday and realized that its reputation is well-deserved. The hospital truly has unparalleled advantages. The Weiguang Sanatorium is located at No. 120 Laoliyu Road. The location is quiet, the environment is beautiful, the hospital is surrounded by lush flowers and trees, the air is fresh, the architecture is new, and the layout is extremely elegant. As for attentive care and hygienic food, they are especially noteworthy.

According to the hospital, "An Di Du Jing" is indeed capable of completely stopping addiction in four days and discharging patients in seven days, and it is absolutely non-intoxicating and non-comatose. It is safe and effective, with no pain. The sanatorium also has unique advantages in terms of treatment. No wonder its achievements over the years have been remarkable and have been highly praised by people from all walks of life, who unanimously recognize it as the only paradise for treatment and smoking cessation.

A person who torments himself with 'regret' is one hundred percent weak.

Self-abandonment is the death sentence of 'success' and the fatal wound of 'happiness.'

A person's greatest pain is nothing more than feeling extreme disappointment in himself.

A person who is always satisfied is not happy, because he will often not be satisfied by others.

Love that has gone through twists and turns is true love, it has blood, tears, and smiles.

### Letter—Regarding the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund

Editor:

After reading your article "Unfolding the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund Movement" on the [date] of last month, I have been deeply moved for several days. I thought that my family was originally poor, and I lost my father when I was young. I relied on my mother's ten fingers to earn a living and maintain our life. At that time, I was sent to the Tongyi Benevolent Society to study, but because I was unable to keep my clothes clean, I was often discriminated against by teachers and friends, which caused me great spiritual pain. I wondered how cold human nature could be? After three years of studying, I finally had to become an apprentice at a pawnshop due to the unbearable living conditions at home. (Omitted) Later, I was introduced by a friend to work in a pharmaceutical factory and had spare time to attend vocational school for remedial education, but good times did not last long, and I resigned due to an accident. I have been wandering in society for many years, all because of my shallow knowledge, and I have not been able to obtain a noble profession to seek welfare for society. Now I see that your newspaper is appealing for scholarship funds for disaster-stricken children, and its significance is so great that it cannot be compared to ordinary things. Therefore, all of us who have lost the opportunity to study should give deep sympathy and assistance so that those who are eager to learn can achieve something and seek happiness for the country and society. Therefore, I specially donate one yuan per month. I did not expect that my little sincerity would be so praised by you. I feel really ashamed and will work harder in the future to repay your love. Please forgive me for any offense. I respectfully wish you good health.

Shen Fengbiao bows

Editor's Note: The above is a letter from Mr. Shen Fengbiao, a waiter at the Continental Hotel on Yuchaqing Road. The writing is clear and fluent, and the emotions are overflowing, truly rare. Mr. Shen speaks from personal experience, telling his own story, and expressing sympathy for the students. In addition to deeply thanking him on behalf of the students, we also wish Mr. Shen well! As the saying goes, "You reap what you sow." Mr. Shen is not a utilitarian, and if he has this kind of true intention of "upholding righteousness without seeking profit, clarifying the path without calculating功績," expanding it, he will be suitable for everything. Mr. Shen will have gains for the country and society. Therefore, we are publishing it urgently to encourage others!

### So That's How It Is

— Yao Yao

A: That Mr. Wang has been married for less than half a year, but he has already become a millionaire.

B: Oh! Then Miss Sun is really a virtuous helper, but I wonder what Mr. Wang was like before marriage?

A: I heard that he was a wealthy man with tens of millions of assets.

Student A: Where do you get so much money every day?

Student B: It all comes from my pen.

Student A: Come on! Someone like you only needs to skip a few dances, but you would also sell articles?

Student B: No, I don't sell articles with my pen, I often use my pen to write letters to my father asking for money!

### Record of Bitter Laughter

— Liu Zijing

Female: I'm here to apply for the position of female secretary.

Manager (examining her): So, can you little meeting….

Female: Yes, I can type, take shorthand, and also copy…

Manager: No! I'm asking if you can dance?

Female:?

Mother: Why did you give such a good pancake to that wretch?

Son: Because I thought if he snatched it, wouldn't it be the same!

### Snake Encircling Egg

— Huang Yingjian

This humble person had eggs for breakfast. When I cracked the egg, I suddenly found a snake-like object, more than four inches long and half an inch wide, coiled around the complete egg yolk. It was white, with a slightly larger head and two eyes.

Since eggs are recognized as the cleanest food, how could such a disgusting monster be hidden in them? It is unheard of and unseen. I am reporting this to the newspaper for biological research.

### Begonia

Eleven Night Singing

"Sister-in-law, I…" Mei Bao put down the broom and wanted to interrupt.

"Mei Bao, go inside and steam the leftover buns from yesterday for me!" Qiu Haitang deliberately said this because she didn't want her to participate in this conversation, and wanted to send her away. "I feel a little hungry now, so I want to eat something right away."

Although Mei Shi was very worried that her father would quarrel with Sister-in-law Meng, she didn't dare to be stubborn since Qiu Haitang had said so, so she slowly walked into the kitchen with cold sweat in her hands.

"Dad is in a bad mood today. If he quarrels with Sister-in-law Meng, how will I ever have the face to see her again?" As she took a plate of a dozen buns from the cupboard and put them in the pot, she was still thinking this way. "It's best to think of a way to call her in and explain it to her first so that things don't get worse…"

But what could she do?

Although she was very smart and usually very good at coming up with ideas, she didn't dare to try anything again when she thought of her father's anger just now.

"Let them fight it out!" She impatiently lifted the pot lid again and again, pressing on the buns with her fingers to see if they were cooked. But these buns seemed to be deliberately making things difficult for her. After steaming for nearly ten minutes, they were only half heated. "I'll wait until tonight and talk to them myself. As long as I promise to give a few dollars to the master, they probably won't be angry anymore." (179)

### Dying with Open Eyes

— Yao Yao

A dying shop owner asked his wife, "Is my eldest son here?"

Eldest son: "Dad! I'm here."

Shop owner: "Is my second son here?"

Second son: "Dad! I'm here too."

Shop owner: "Then, is my third son here too?"

Third son: "Yes, Dad! I'm here too."

Shop owner: "So, my daughter probably isn't here!"

Daughter (anxiously): "No, Dad! I'm here too."

The shop owner suddenly shouted, "If you're all here, aren't you going to do business in the shop?"

The shop owner sighed repeatedly and finally died.

### Career

— Jing Fa

Enthusiasm is the spirit of a career. (Albert Einstein)

With a good spirit, there is a great career. (L. von Beethoven)

People cannot live without relying on a career. (Robert Owen)

I only rely on diligence and accumulation to complete my career. (Charles Darwin)

The root of a career may be bitter, but its fruit is sweet. (Immanuel Kant)

### Hollywood Stars

— Xin Juan

The true face of Lushan will disappoint you; thanks to the beautician's painstaking efforts.

Every movie fan always thinks that Hollywood is a nest of beauties, but that is just an illusion. Let me tell you, there are hardly any perfect men or perfect women in Hollywood. Although men are all handsome and beautiful on the screen, and women are all as beautiful as fairies, in reality, they all have one or two flaws. The reason they appear so beautiful on the screen is due to the superb skills of the makeup artists. Let me give you a few examples, and you will surely believe it:

Errol Flynn is known as a "handsome man," but he has a bit of a "sunken mouth." In films such as "Robin Hood," "The Sea Hawk," "The Adventures of Robin Hood," "Gentleman Jim," "They Died with Their Boots On," and "Edge of Darkness," it is not easy to see because he has a mustache. However, in the film "The Prince and the Pauper," where he does not have a mustache and is clean-shaven, it is visible.

Myrna Loy has freckles on her face, but they are not visible because of the thick powder.

Sonja Henie is very short and chubby. It all depends on the photographer's superb skills and accurate lighting, otherwise, it would be "embarrassing."

Clark Gable appears quite tall and burly on the screen, but someone who has seen him in Hollywood in person said that he is short and chubby. When he is with female leads who are taller, he has to wear lifts and high heels. As for his "protruding ears," they can also be seen on the screen.

Carole Lombard has a slightly protruding forehead. She must be made up to make her cheeks appear sunken and mysterious in order to hide the defects of her forehead.

Maerene Oberon is known as a "standard beauty," but her nose looks like a hook from a certain angle. In addition, her skin is delicate, which requires the makeup artist to put in a lot of effort.

Charles Boyer's hair is almost so thin that he is bald. Bing Crosby is also like this. It is really a "crime" for a "romantic young man" to have this problem.

Katharine Hepburn's pronunciation is unclear, so sound engineers find it a headache.

Tony Martin has a very long neck, so he needs to wear wide collars. His chin is more than two inches above his clothes.

Tyrone Power and Gary Cooper are thin; Robert Taylor and Spencer Tracy are fat; Miguel Lina is short. Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo are thin; Hedy Lamarr and Deanna Durbin are fat; Olivia de Havilland is short.

James Stewart is tall, James Cagney is short; Edward G. Robinson, John Garfield, and George Raft are also quite short, sometimes requiring lifts.

Ann Sheridan's right cheek is slightly chubby, and her nose is not well-shaped, so she must first use cosmetic surgery to fix it, and special attention is paid to her arms and shoulders when shooting.

Madeleine Carroll's face is half beautiful and half bad, so when shooting her close-ups, a three-quarter angle must be used to turn her thin side into normal.

Nelson Eddy has myopia and many wrinkles on his forehead.

Famous amateur Lu Jinrong, also known as Jianfeng, is intelligent and works for the French-owned water and electricity company. He has been an amateur for more than ten years and specializes in Qipai opera. "Running the City," "Leaving the Kiln," "Four Scholars," "Chopping the Scripture Hall," and "Heavenly Thunder Report" are all his masterpieces. Not only does his singing and recitation closely imitate Xin Fang, but his gestures and expressions are also completely lifelike. He used to be the director of the Pingju group of the Sino-French Alumni Association and is now a basic member of the Yashe amateur troupe. The picture shows Lu Jinrong and famous amateur Wang Wenbiao in a joint performance of "Heavenly Thunder Report."

### Hard Struggle to Overcome the Environment

The Human World is Equal to Heaven

The script for "The Cowherd and Weaver Girl" has been completed, and Lafay will perform it after "The Border Town Story." According to Wei Ruhui, the reporter said yesterday: "Although this is a mythical play, the story is set in the Ming Dynasty during the era of Qi Jiguang. It depicts the celebration held in various towns and villages on the seventh day of the seventh month after Qi Jiguang quelled the pirates. However, in a small village, the villagers are extremely abused and oppressed by the landlords. That night, the Weaver Girl has a dream. She and the Cowherd are sad all the way until they meet an old man. The old man tells them that they can avoid suffering by going to heaven and points them to a path. The Cowherd and Weaver Girl go together. Unexpectedly, at the gate between heaven and earth, a demon appears and first lures them with material things, telling them not to go. They do not listen, so the Weaver Girl is captured, and the Cowherd is rescued by the old man and rushes to the demon's lair. At this time, the Weaver Girl is being whipped by the demon. When the old man and the Cowherd rush over, the demon finally fails, so the three of them go to the hall together. In heaven, the leader is a goddess, and all around are free and happy villagers tilling the fields. The Cowherd and Weaver Girl ask the goddess why the villagers in the human world do not have the freedom and happiness of those in heaven? The goddess says that it is through hard struggle, with a strong will, and overcoming the environment, that the human world becomes equal to heaven. The content is roughly like this. The main principle is that we should commemorate the July 7th National Renaissance Festival with a fearless spirit."

### Abandon Old Rules and Take a New Path — Ge Ge Expresses His Opinions

— Wei Ren

The Longmen Grand Theater, which was rebuilt from the Green Treasure Dance Hall, has now been renovated and is scheduled to open officially on the 15th of this month.

It is rumored that the Huasheng Troupe will perform at the theater, but according to reporters, this news is not true. The Longmen Grand Theater has reached an agreement with the Yuele Troupe led by Yao Shuijuan to perform improved Yue Opera from the 15th.

The person responsible for improving Yue Opera is Ge Ge, the new artist who is promoting the improvement of Shanghai Opera. He expressed his opinions:

"After reading Mr. Jintao's article 'A View on the Past and Present of Women's Yue Opera' published in the entertainment section a few days ago, I was very touched. He listed many points that should be improved in Yue Opera and provided valuable and specific methods. What he said is really practical and thorough. I am an artist, so I naturally have to stand in a solemn position and pay attention to the future of Yue Opera. I hope that Yue Opera practitioners can abandon the old rules and take a new path."

"It's not an easy thing for you to improve Yue Opera," I interrupted.

"Yes, the success of a thing always has to go through some difficulties. In the past, when I worked with Mei Xi, Lu Chen, and others to improve Shanghai Opera, we encountered obstacles everywhere and couldn't get anywhere at the beginning. But today, our efforts have paid off. In terms of scripts, actors' acting skills, makeup, and scenery, everything has been satisfied by Shanghai Opera audiences. Recently, the Empress will perform 'Wind and Waves Pavilion,' which is a tragic story of justice. In the past, the ladies of Shanghai liked to watch that kind of drama with the typical 'entrusting lifelong happiness in the backyard.' Now we want them to change their tastes. This cannot be said to be a success, but I dare to say that it is for the progress of Shanghai Opera. Today, the improvement of Yue Opera is also based on this condition.

Finally, Ge Ge also told me that Yao Shuijuan's first performance at Longmen is "Big Family," which is directed by Zhang Shichuan and staged by Chen Ming. I hope that those who care about the future of Yue Opera and want to improve it can do some practical work and take on the mission of artists.

### Blood Two Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 14 Yuan Yuan Small Words, Delicate and Beautiful

The poet Xiyu was favored by the beauty, so he still often came to the dressing room to be close to her. Today, Yuanyuan was invited by the poet for a tour of Lingyan. The two drank wine and wrote poems in the boat, enjoying the scenery and having a truly joyful time. When the boat arrived at Lingyan, the two left the boat and went ashore, hiring two shoulder carriers to go up the mountain to play. The weather was fine, and there were many tourists. Many people saw this beautiful couple, and everyone was fascinated, wondering where this divine couple came from. Some people who recognized Yuanyuan were talking about her amorous affairs behind her back. Xiyu the poet and Chen Yuanyuan rested for a long time in the mountain temple, but because there were too many people watching them, they left. The two were wandering and appreciating the scenery near the Xiangxie Corridor when they suddenly saw a group of people coming from the mountain path to the east. Several family members were walking in front, shouting and telling others to get out of the way. Behind them, several gentlemen in formal attire were surrounding an old man in his sixties, wearing a red robe and a jade belt, with very noble manners. He spoke with a northern accent and must be a noble person from Beijing. Looking at the group of people serving the old man, there was a slippery young man. Yuanyuan recognized this person as the playboy Gao Qi, and she couldn't help but feel a little surprised and suspicious. She wondered how this fellow knew such a noble person and quickly turned her face away, looking at an ancient pine tree under the rock, silently. However, the poet Xiyu had not noticed anything and was still talking and laughing with her. But at this time, the playboy had already seen Yuanyuan. Even if Yuanyuan did not turn her face back, with her graceful waist and beautiful back, the playboy could recognize her with just a glance. They slowly approached. The old man looked around and suddenly saw Yuanyuan's beautiful figure. He couldn't help but stop and stare at Yuanyuan in detail. He looked back at the people around him and praised, "The beauty on the opposite side is truly a beauty that can captivate a city, a peerless beauty. I pity her even when I see her. I wonder which family's daughter is she?" The old man asked. The playboy quickly said, "Old Sir, this beauty is not a fragrant boudoir daughter, but a courtesan, Chen Yuanyuan, who is famous in the south of the Yangtze River." (136)

### Miscellaneous Notes on Theater

— Fen Yu

Since the president of the Carlton Yi Feng Drama Society, Zhou Xinfang, announced its disbandment, the actors have gone to other cities or joined various theaters in Shanghai. Xinfang has been very generous to them, giving each person ten days' worth of salary in addition to not deducting any debts owed. He expressed with great emotion to people, "This group of people was trained with a lot of effort. It won't be easy for me to get another group like this!" Now, the Carlton authorities have removed the glass sign and shelves in front of the building. Passing by there evokes a sense of vicissitude!

After the disbandment of the Yi Feng Society, Gao Baisui took a group of people to perform in other cities. However, he had already accepted a contract from Gong Wu Tai, which Zhang Shankun had lent to the Yi Feng Society. Therefore, Gong Wu Tai recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Theater Industry Friendship Association, notifying member theaters not to hire him. When Gao returns to Shanghai, if he does not cooperate with Zhou Xinfang, he will undoubtedly go to Gong Wu Tai.

The Shanghai Actors' United Association has organized a welfare reserve fund committee. Starting this month, members performing in Shanghai are obligated to donate one day's salary each month. It is estimated that 100,000 yuan can be obtained after two years. This money is intended to be lent to unemployed members and to cope with unexpected events.

The new actors of the Tianchan Stage, Chen Hongsheng and Chen Guilan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and are staying at the Jinling Hotel. Starting tomorrow, they will begin visiting people from all walks of life and will soon take the stage.

The five new installments of Journey to the West at the Gengxin Stage are written by Li Zhenwu, a talented student of Ouyang Yuqian. A dress rehearsal was held last night, and it will be performed on the night of the ninth. The main plots are Zhu Bajie stealing ginseng fruit, Sun Wukong making trouble in Wuzhuang Temple, Zhu Bajie stealing elixir in Dou Shuai Palace, and Sun Wukong subduing the lion monster in the Wuji Kingdom.

(Editor's Note) This publication has specially commissioned Mr. Fen Yu to collect news from various theaters and the activities of actors in Shanghai every day, striving for speed, conciseness, and accuracy. Please pay attention to this, gentlemen.
