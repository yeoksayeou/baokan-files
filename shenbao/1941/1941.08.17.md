### Three-Nation Conference of England, America, and the Soviet Union Decided to Be Held in Moscow to Discuss War Equipment and Resource Allocation Procedures; England and America Will Send High-Ranking Representatives to Attend

Reuters, London, 16th -- During their meeting at sea, U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill jointly telegraphed Stalin, proposing that high-ranking representatives from England and America meet with the Soviet government in Moscow to discuss important matters regarding aid to the Soviet Union. The telegram also offered assurances that the Soviet Union would continue to receive supplies as quickly as possible during the conference. The telegram stated, "Upon considering reports following Mr. [blank's] return from Moscow, we take this opportunity to discuss how our two countries can best assist your country in repelling the Nazi attacks. We are currently cooperating to provide your country with a stockpile of supplies that you urgently need. Many ships have already departed from our coasts carrying these supplies, and many more ships will follow immediately in succession. The needs of your country and your armed forces must be determined after careful consideration of many factors. For the sake of rapid decision-making on the allocation of our combined resources in all aspects, we now propose preparing for a conference in Moscow. We will send high-ranking representatives to attend so as to discuss this matter directly with you. If you agree with this, then we wish you to know that while the conference has not reached a decision, we will continue to provide your country with supplies and materials as quickly as possible. We must now turn our minds to considering more far-reaching policies, for a long and arduous journey lies ahead before complete victory can be achieved. Without complete victory, our efforts will be in vain. The war is being fought on many fronts, and while the war is not yet over, or new fronts may be discovered in newly developed areas. Although our resources are vast, they are ultimately limited. Where and when can our resources be most appropriately used to enhance our common efforts? This is of course a problem, as are the manufactured war equipment and raw materials. We deeply understand how important your country's brave and righteous resistance is to the failure of Hitlerism, so we feel that in any case we must act quickly and immediately to formulate a procedure for the future allocation of our common resources."

[Stalin] greatly approves of the suggestion to convene a conference of representatives from the three countries in Moscow to discuss the allocation of war equipment and has prepared to take all necessary steps to ensure that this conference can be held soon.

Reuters, Moscow, 16th -- Today, all Soviet newspapers prominently published commentaries on the historic meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, calling it of the highest political significance.

United Press, Washington, 16th -- Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that he hopes all civilized nations of the world, including the Soviet Union, can uphold the Roosevelt-Churchill joint declaration to destroy the Nazi reign of violence and rebuild a new world order.

United Press, London, 16th -- Yesterday, authoritative circles here commented on the possibility of Japan preventing domestic civilian ships from Vladivostok from providing aid to the Soviet Union, saying, "Britain will do its utmost to realize its policy of aiding the Soviet Union." However, no statement was made regarding what action Britain would take if Japan attempted to blockade Vladivostok.

United Press, New York, 16th -- Simms, the international editor of the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain, reported yesterday that the "Anglo-American alliance" produced by the "Eight-Point Peace Declaration" can be expected to advance the war to its climax as soon as possible. He said, "If Berlin and Tokyo doubt President Roosevelt's determination to fight if necessary to end their intention to rule the world, then they are extremely foolish."

### Startling Action by the Two Countries; America Believes It Refers to the Far East Situation; Rumors Also Say British Troops Will Land in Northern Europe

Reuters, London, 16th -- A Reuters parliamentary correspondent said that after the announcement of the telegram from the two major leaders of England and America to Stalin, a portion of the many matters discussed at the maritime conference over several days has been disclosed. The eight principles agreed upon in three to five days are not the entire result of the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. Now that the eight principles have been issued, the important telegram has been made public within thirty-six hours. It is expected that the authorities will make other disclosures to supplement these eight principles. In summary, the sole purpose of the British and American authorities is to eradicate Hitlerism wherever it rears its head in the world. The phrase in the original telegram, "the war is currently being fought on many fronts and there may be future battles on new fronts," has already indicated this action.

Reuters, New York, 16th -- Last night, newspapers carried a news item claiming that U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill plan to suggest to Soviet Union's Stalin that a conference be convened in Moscow, with attendees including Stalin, his military leaders, and high-ranking U.S. and British officials. The New York Post headlined, "Three-Power Conference Planned in the Soviet Capital." The New York World Telegram anticipated that there will be startling action by the U.S. and Britain after the maritime conference.

Reuters, Washington, 16th -- Observers here all believe that the Roosevelt-Churchill telegram to Stalin contains the first concrete action towards practically eliminating Nazi tyranny. The telegram clearly expresses the importance of providing the Soviet Union with critical war equipment, and the phrase "another battlefield" is widely believed here to refer directly to the Far East situation. Some quarters believe that the telegram is a warning to Japan that the two leaders have already agreed on an action. Observers also believe that the telegram reflects England and America's confidence in the Soviet Union's ability to withstand Germany.

International News Service, 16th -- After the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, talk of a British attack on Europe to aid the Soviet Union has intensified. All sectors believe that the British Prime Minister will take actions further than the declaration. The London Evening Standard predicts that invading British troops will land in "Murmansk" or "Archangel." It is said that the good opportunity to attack Norway and Holland and establish a second front against Germany should not be missed. The Daily Mail says that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill are currently "somewhere near the U.S. coast" and are jointly protected by British and American sea and air forces. The Soviet Union is constantly receiving reports regarding the progress of the conference.

### British Minister of Supply in Washington, Says Anti-Axis Countries Need Vast American Aid

Reuters, New York, 16th -- The New York Times' Washington dispatch reports that Federal Loan Administrator Jones hosted a banquet this afternoon for British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook. Mr. Beaverbrook delivered a brief speech to U.S. defense officials, assuring them that Britain does not need American manpower to win the war and stating that he is deeply satisfied with the greatest possible material assistance the United States is giving to Britain. The list of British material needs that Mr. Beaverbrook presented has led some attendees to believe that the United States must expand its war equipment production to an extent that has only been imagined thus far, in order to assist not only Britain but also other anti-Axis countries. At the same time, it is said that the United States is currently planning to establish a better organization to handle the creation of the Distribution Advisory Committee, which will include representatives from the Chinese, British, and Soviet governments, as well as others who may resist the Axis in the future.

### America's Production Power Rapidly Increasing; Japan's Southern Advance Will Be Gradual

Reuters, Washington, 16th -- Speculation continues to swirl here about the possibility of President Roosevelt delivering an early "fireside chat." Generally speaking, America's industrial and war efforts are rapidly increasing to their maximum power. The extent of aid to Britain now exceeds what the American or British public imagines. This aid will automatically and gradually increase in quantity. However, it would be a mistake to hope that as a result of the Anglo-American joint declaration, the United States will take further action without Germany and Japan taking further actions.

Reuters, Chongqing, 16th -- Well-informed sources here anticipate major international developments in the Pacific and Europe in the near future. Chinese observers still believe that although Japan speaks grandly of its southern advance program, it will currently proceed slowly to avoid a major war with England and America, while at the same time, it seems to be concentrating its efforts on the north in order to attack the Soviet Union's Far East Army. On the other hand, in order to protect its rear, Japan must consolidate its position in the South China Sea before launching a northern attack; this is the reason for Japan's occupation of southern Vietnam. These observers do not mean that Japan has no ambition to advance southward, but believe that the timing for this move is not yet ripe and will likely stir up trouble when England and America are occupied elsewhere, so that Japan can advance southward without risking war with England and America.

### Philippine General Election Approaching; Quezon Still Nominated as Presidential Candidate

Reuters, Manila, 16th -- The Nationalist Party Executive Committee nominated President Quezon and Vice President Osmena as candidates for president and vice president in the next general election.

### President Roosevelt Returns to Washington Today; Historic Voyage at Sea Comes to an End; Will Immediately Invite the Press to Talk

Reuters, Washington, 16th -- President Roosevelt is scheduled to land in Rockland, Maine, this afternoon, marking the end of his historically valuable voyage at sea. It is said that the President will return to Washington on Sunday.

Reuters, Sippscott, Massachusetts, 16th -- The White House has issued hints that President Roosevelt may disembark from the ship today. Undersecretary of State Welles met with Hull yesterday morning for quite some time after returning to Washington from the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting.

United Press, Sippscott, Massachusetts, 16th -- Representatives of most major American newspapers gathered here today to await news of when and where President Roosevelt will land, as well as the release of details of the meeting between the President and British Prime Minister Churchill. It is reported that the President will immediately convene a press conference after returning to Washington. The President's special train is already waiting in Boston.

Reuters, New York, 16th -- According to a Washington correspondent for The New York Times, President Roosevelt will land in New York at around 6:00 PM today (Greenwich Mean Time), rest for two or three hours, and then take a train back to Washington.

Reuters, Washington, 16th -- Republican House Representative Thill stated in the House yesterday that if President Roosevelt met with British Prime Minister Churchill outside of American territory, he was not acting in his official capacity. He pointed out that President Wilson's attendance at the Versailles Peace Conference in the past had been specifically approved by Congress.

### America Will Implement Commercial Pressure on Japan and Aid Free France; Purchase of Oilseed Vegetable Oil

United Press, Washington, 16th -- Vice President Wallace confirmed last night that the Economic Defense Board will first focus on imposing commercial pressure on Japan and aiding Free French territories in Africa. However, he refused to discuss the details of this plan. The nature of the economic plan implemented against Japan has not been revealed, but it is reported that the government has various methods available to completely cut off commerce with Japan at any time. Japanese funds in the United States have been frozen and can only be used with the permission of the U.S. Treasury Department. All commerce with Japan is subject to export license restrictions, which can be used to completely halt commerce with Japan. The method of aiding Free French Africa is expected to be the purchase of palm oil and vegetable oil produced in central Africa. It is reported that the Free French forces have approximately 500,000 tons of this oil.

Editorial

### The Anglo-American Talks and the Far East

After the Roosevelt-Churchill talks became public, the world knew that the joint declaration issued by both sides was merely a form of "official statement," yet they still paid great attention to it. This is because the content of the declaration fully proves that England and America have decided to "cooperate to curb aggression, defeat tyranny, and establish a lasting peace with justice for all freedom-loving countries in the world." The essence of the eight points listed in the joint declaration is nothing more than this. At first glance, it seems like mere empty talk, but in reality, it demonstrates that England and America have the "ultimate determination and concrete plan" to spare no cost in jointly crushing the forces of aggression. This is not to say that England and America lacked determination or plans in the past, but it can be confidently asserted that after this face-to-face negotiation between the two leaders, anything that lacked coherence in the past will definitely be appropriately adjusted in the future, anything that was merely limited to the local level in the past will definitely be expanded into a comprehensive plan that is coherent from beginning to end, and anything that was still in the stage of deliberation and study in the past will definitely be put into practice at any time in the future. Moreover, the fact that the military chiefs of both countries took time out of their busy schedules to participate in the talks in person further proves that the scope of discussion and the decisions made by both sides will definitely not be limited to the eight principles seen in the joint declaration.

Regarding the specific decisions of this meeting, the officials have remained tight-lipped until now, and there is very little information from outside. According to the United Press, it is said that under the Roosevelt-Churchill agreement, the United States will focus its attention on the Pacific situation in the future, so that England and the Soviet Union can allocate greater strength to deal with Germany. Reuters speculates that this meeting will definitely involve three major issues: (1) the Atlantic War, (2) aid to the Soviet Union, and (3) the Far East situation. The former refers to the division of labor and cooperation, while the latter refers to the objects of discussion. Of course, both are possible. We believe that judging solely from the strict confidentiality of this meeting and the importance of the participants' positions, it can be asserted that the scope of discussion is very broad and the decisions made are not ordinary. Generally speaking, Roosevelt and Churchill comprehensively assessed all possible events that may occur in various parts of the world in the future, and then, based on the submissions of various experts, especially the military authorities, decided on a comprehensive plan to deal with each situation separately. However, since the United States is a democratic country and a neutral country that has always advocated the Monroe Doctrine, any measures decided by the President without the permission of Congress will inevitably be somewhat passive in nature. In other words, no matter how firm President Roosevelt's will is, under the limitations of the Constitution, he cannot rashly declare war on foreign countries or engage in actions that the opposition may accuse of participation in the war, unless the other party provokes first. Therefore, as far as the Far East is concerned, it is not difficult for us to imagine all the steps decided by the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting. All economic sanctions and all assistance measures based on the Lend-Lease Act can of course be implemented step by step in an active manner in the future (the British announcement of the prohibition of exports to Japan and the arrival of American oil tankers in Vladivostok are clear evidence of this), but in the military aspect, both England and America—especially America—can only temporarily limit themselves to strengthening their own combat capabilities in dangerous areas and actively assisting other countries that are already or may potentially fight side by side, unless Japan dares to take any new actions. Specifically, unless Japan finally invades Thailand or carries out a northern advance, or even attempts to cut off the American aid route to the Soviet Union, the military actions against Japan agreed upon by the Anglo-American leaders a few days ago can be put into practice. Otherwise, one side will only step up its guard to block all loopholes that Japan can exploit, while the other side will continue to weaken Japan's remaining expansionist power in the economic and other aspects. It is like a poker game. Although it has now reached the "showdown" stage, the question is that China, England, America, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and other countries are all watching Japan's final card, and the democratic front is by no means in a situation where it has no choice but to show its cards first.

The assassination of Hiranuma foreshadows extreme unrest within Japan, which will force the Konoe cabinet to take risks. If Konoe is still "undecided," causing extreme "dissatisfaction" among some military personnel, then Japan may be brewing a new cabinet crisis. Conversely, if Japan disregards everything and decides to act recklessly, then in this situation where the Anglo-American authorities have already formulated an entire response plan and all the democratic countries in the Far East are on high alert, one can sense that the mire Japan will encounter will be more than just China. These days, the Tokyo authorities are in this dilemma, and words like hesitation, anxiety, and doubt are probably not enough to describe their state of mind even by a fraction.

### Chinese Army in Northern Hubei Attacks Suixian County Seat; Japanese Transportation Line in Western Suburbs Destroyed; Japanese Army in Xinyang Repelled After Offending Northward

Chongqing Military News (1) The 16th Army of Zao Yang and a certain unit of the Chinese Army in Northern Hubei attacked Suixian County seat at 4:00 PM on the 13th, encountering the Japanese army at Wangjiatai in the western suburbs. Fierce fighting ensued throughout the night, and by dawn on the 14th, over a hundred Japanese were killed. The transportation route from the city to Leigudun was destroyed for several miles, and the unit returned with spoils of war. (2) According to a telegram from Guilo on the 16th, a Japanese warship with several motorboats arrived near Huang Gong Miao (west of Yueyang) on the 11th, shelling the shore and strafing with machine guns, attempting to land and create chaos. The Chinese army fiercely counterattacked, and the Japanese were unable to withstand it and fled. (3) According to a telegram from Heyuan on the 16th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Fanhe Dan, east of Danshui, on the evening of the 13th. The Japanese army hid in fortifications and did not dare to come out. The Chinese army left a unit to monitor and the main force detoured to Nianshanwei to attack, annihilating its guarding unit. The remaining Japanese in the fortress retreated. (Telegram on the 16th)

Chongqing Military News (1) The Japanese army in Xinyang, Henan Province, recently gathered more than 5,000 troops, with some cavalry and ten artillery guns, and began to create chaos starting on the 8th. On the morning of the 9th, they divided their forces and attacked Muyou River, Wujia Dian, Chenjia Dian, Chashan, Changping Pass, Gucheng, Heishan, and Shenyangtai (all northwest of Xiyang). The Chinese army counterattacked on all fronts, repelling the Japanese army. Due to the failed offensive, the Japanese army, in addition to using a unit to harass Zhu Lin via Yangjia River in an attempt to contain the situation, launched another full-scale attack on Shenyangtai and Chashan on the morning of the 11th in an attempt to succeed. The Chinese army's units on all fronts bravely contained the attacking Japanese army, while also dispatching a strong unit to detour and attack the rear of the Japanese army. Finally, on the evening of the 12th, the entire Japanese army was defeated. The part of the Japanese army that attacked Zhu Lin was also ambushed by the Chinese army, suffering more than half of casualties. The Japanese army retreated in disorder towards You River and Xinyang. The Chinese army's units on all fronts took advantage of the victory to pursue the retreating Japanese army, and by the 13th, the original situation had been restored. In this battle, nearly 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed and many spoils of war were captured. (2) The Japanese army that invaded south from Shashi, Cenhekou, Yizikou, and Qianjiang totaled approximately 6,000 troops. They were repelled by the Chinese army, and the Chinese army has now restored the situation before the war three days ago. In this battle, approximately 500 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the number of prisoners is still being tallied. (Telegram on the 5th)

Enshi The Japanese army in Yichang launched harassment northward in the late last month, but was fiercely attacked by the Chinese army and was defeated. This time, the Japanese launched their offensive, first starting from the northeast of Yichang, with a total force of approximately 14,000 troops, gathering at Longquanpu, Yijia Zui, and other places. They began their northern offensive on the 27th of last month. After being contained and wounded by the Chinese army, reinforcements arrived the next morning. The Chinese and Japanese armies engaged in fierce battles on the line from Changcen Gang, Wujin Shan, Tianxian Shan to Chenjia Tai. On the evening of the same day, the Chinese army captured Changcen Gang. The Japanese army suffered hundreds of casualties. Later, the Chinese army killed five to six hundred Japanese at Wujin Shan, Faguanquan, and other places. Afterwards, in order to give the Japanese a greater blow, they attracted the Japanese to the Gaoxia Shi and Fenxiang Chang areas on the 31st of last month, and then launched a fierce assault from the high ground towards the Japanese. They also ambushed the invading Japanese army along the way at Xujia Po, Shishan, Songjia Di, and other places, killing or wounding more than 2,000 people. The remaining troops retreated in disorder and were then ambushed by the Chinese, finally retreating to Yichang on the 6th and 7th, leaving corpses everywhere and turning the river water red. The Japanese army that attacked Zuojia Wan, Longwang Dong, and the Japanese army that attacked from Erliupo and Caojia Ya were also defeated by the Chinese army, with more than a thousand killed or wounded. In total, the Japanese suffered more than 5,000 casualties, including the early [blank] brigade commander and the East [blank] artillery battalion commander. Seventeen were captured and countless spoils of war were seized. The original intention of the Japanese this time was to achieve the goal of defending by attacking, but the result was ultimately crushed. (Telegram on the 15th)

### Chairman Chiang Commends Chongqing Air Defense Personnel, Allocates 300,000 Yuan to Distribute to Those Who Serve; Editor-in-Chief of Yishih Pao Killed in Air Raid

Chongqing Official announcement today: Chairman Chiang, for the outstanding service of the air defense personnel in the recent air raids in Chongqing City, has specially ordered a donation of 300,000 yuan in national currency for reward. The Air Defense Committee now sells "air raid cakes" to people in air raid shelters during air raids. These "air raid cakes" are transported by trucks and sold at the entrances of major air raid shelters in the city. Before the implementation of the "air raid cake" plan, vendors brought large quantities of food and drinks to the entrances of air raid shelters, but people often could not bring them into the shelters in the short time before the air raids. As a result, those engaged in this business earned a hundredfold profit. (United Press, 16th)

### The United States Will Lead the Bulwark of Democracy, Britain and the Soviet Union Remain Vigilant in the Far East, China and Australia Welcome the Anglo-American Declaration

United Press, London, 16th. Under the Roosevelt-Churchill agreement, the United States is expected to lead the bulwark of defending democratic politics and to watch the Pacific. Britain and the Soviet Union yesterday seemed to be preparing to focus their diplomatic attention on Iran. This does not mean that the vigilance of Britain and the Soviet Union in the Far East will be relaxed. According to reliable sources, the anti-Axis Pacific nations will continue to make maximum preparations against Japan. However, London and Moscow will have greater freedom to shift their attention to the unresolved issue of German activity in Iran. The United States will watch the Pacific. An authoritative statement said that Britain will do its utmost to fulfill its promise of assistance, indicating that democratic countries will not retreat if Japan attempts to pre-empt goods transported from Vladivostok. London's anxiety about Japan may be slightly reduced. The consistent "Open Door" policy of democratic countries in the Far East now seems to have greater significance, that is, Japan can improve its relations with Britain and the United States without sacrificing the Soviet Union and China. The door is now half open, but authoritative sources solemnly stated that this improvement should be initiated by Tokyo. Japan's recent outcry about being surrounded by the ABCD (America, Britain, China, and the Netherlands) countries does not cause ripples in the Thames. The fact that the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration did not specifically mention Japan is considered another manifestation of the democratic countries' efforts to avoid provoking Japan and their willingness to pay sympathetic attention should Japan suggest reconsidering its aggressive policies.

United Press, London, 16th. The most striking feature of the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting is the eight-point program demonstrating the peaceful purposes of the two major democracies, but it is believed that other important issues must have been thoroughly discussed. The decisions made should be disclosed within days. It is speculated that the following three major issues were also discussed: (1) the Atlantic War; (2) aid to the Soviet Union; and (3) the situation in the Far East. Regarding the first point, the entire existing defense system will be revised. As for how to revise it, it is of course a confidential matter. In the future, Germany will learn at a heavy price the greater efficiency of the Anglo-American deployments. Regarding aid to the Soviet Union, consultations with the Soviet authorities are about to take place. Major British and American representatives will meet with the Soviet government to discuss obtaining rapid decisions and appropriate distribution of common resources. It is said that Hopkins is well aware of what the Soviet Union needs most, so it is in line with expectations that Britain and the United States will make suggestions to the Soviet Union along this line. As for the Far East, the continued arrival of reinforcements in the Far East shows that precautions are being taken. If the Japanese government is a little considerate, the British side has no tendency to take any steps that Japan may regard as provocative. At the same time, Britain and the United States are doing their utmost to accelerate the process of arms production.

Reuters, Chongqing, 16th. All parties here warmly welcome the Roosevelt-Churchill statement. Semi-official sources say that this declaration demonstrates broad political skills and can promote closer cooperation among countries resisting aggression. Chinese political circles are particularly satisfied that Britain and the United States regard disarming the Axis powers after the war as one of their main war aims.

Reuters, Melbourne, 16th. Australian Labor leader Curtin criticized the Roosevelt-Churchill statement, saying that this clear outline of goals is fully in line with the spirit and determination of the Australian Labor Party. I cannot imagine that any country, including Germany and the occupied countries, has trade unions that are not moved by this historic statement. All those who doubt that British and American workers have any other purpose in this struggle besides the righteous purpose of resisting aggression can forever dispel their doubts by viewing this statement.

German Criticism of the Anglo-American Declaration

World News Agency, Berlin, 16th. Since the release of the Anglo-American eight-point joint declaration, the German side has furiously denounced the democratic countries yesterday, calling the declaration a manifestation of the dark world order that the Axis powers are trying to destroy. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry shouted at President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, "If you want to disarm us, please take away our guns. Dare you?" The Nazi press fiercely attacked the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting and the Anglo-American joint declaration, denouncing them as "empty threats." A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said, "Now all of Europe can see what Europe will encounter if the democratic countries have a future in the world. Today's Anglo-American eight-point declaration is a shortened version of the fourteen-point program of the late US President Wilson. Since 1919, this program has often made the European air turbid. Now the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration repeats the old story, which is just right to show why the Axis powers should win. The democratic countries have now lifted the veil of their pretense and revealed their true purpose, which is more selfish than what was planned at Versailles."

United Press International, Berlin, 16th. Referring to the eight points of the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration yesterday, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said that the joint declaration was in fact an event that no longer exists. Regarding the Anglo-American plan to launch a peace offensive, the spokesman said, "We only have one offensive, that is, a military offensive; only one purpose, that is, to annihilate the enemy; only one mission, that is, to achieve victory. Peace can only be discussed after victory." The harvest of the Atlantic Conference was the opposite of what everyone expected, because after listening to the propaganda from that side, people were all paying attention to the development of this "important event." Political figures in Berlin are quite satisfied that the representatives of the two major democratic countries have put Germany in a position of being propagated. The divergence of the goals of the two major politicians is quite noteworthy. Wales once talked about the League of Nations after the war, and Eden also proposed an international police organization with considerable power, but in the declaration, the so-called League of Nations or similar organizations were not mentioned at all. I don't know if this is due to Roosevelt's opinion or due to Churchill's opinion. The so-called "points" still remain in the declaration. Wilson was the inventor of these "points," but at that time, the number was slightly larger than this time, and the faces were also slightly different. Europeans still have a deep impression of this famous "point" and will never want to try this "point" again. The Foreign Ministry further believes that a point mentioned by a British news agency reporter earlier, that the meeting was initiated by Roosevelt, is extremely noteworthy. This reminds people of an idiom, that is, victory is obtained by everyone, and failure is not caused by everyone. People in Berlin said that the people of Germany and Europe can ask Roosevelt and Churchill in return, can all nations, regardless of size, strength, or weakness, actually obtain freedom of the seas in their new order; are Britain and the United States willing to give up their naval bases and maritime hegemony; is the United States willing to abandon its two-ocean naval plan without threatening Japan; are they willing to open up their resource-rich and sparsely populated areas to allow others to set foot; will Roosevelt hope to restore his Monroe Doctrine; what are Roosevelt's thoughts on the work of suppressing European Bolshevism; are Roosevelt and Churchill planning to abandon their blockade policy and prevent women and children from starving. If these questions are honestly answered, then this joint declaration will immediately be proven to be a fantasy. The people of Europe have already suffered from the experience of this kind of fantasy and do not want to taste its bitterness again.

Reuters, Tokyo, 16th. The Anglo-American joint declaration on world policy has deeply angered the Japanese. In addition, the Japanese Times, the mouthpiece of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, published an editorial on Saturday morning saying that there is nothing new in the eight points of the Anglo-American joint declaration regarding Japanese policy. The newspaper mentioned the second point in the declaration, saying that Japan has no territorial ambitions, which can be evidenced by Japan's public stance towards China and Manchuria. As for the fourth item, Japan has always opened up access to natural resources on an equal basis. The newspaper also said that the ideal of disarmament is welcomed by the world, but any method found by international conferences has failed to implement it. This declaration can be regarded as having historical importance, because it is in line with the wishes that the Axis powers have already announced, but the methods are different.

### Australian Home Secretary Fowles Arrives in Singapore at Invitation, Commander of Australian Forces in Malaya Broadcasts, New Reinforcements Will Focus on Training

Reuters, Singapore, 16th. Australian Home Secretary Fowles, at the invitation of the Malayan government, arrived in Singapore yesterday with a delegation of Australian newspaper reporters. Fowles said that the reinforcements arriving here fully represent Australia, and that the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration, which clarified several war aims, is extremely valuable. He believes this is a prelude to the future publication of more important declarations on war aims. In addition, Major General Bennett, commander of the Australian forces stationed in Malaya, broadcast to Australia last night, saying that the enemy may estimate the strength of its troops by the number of troops, but we estimate the strength of our army by spirit and determination. It is not as important to weigh the size of a dog in a dogfight. The tense situation in this part of the world is quite serious, but the arrival of well-trained and well-equipped reinforcements has increased our confidence in being able to deal with any enemy. All the new reinforcements know that the opportunity must not be lost and will focus on training together. The effectiveness can soon reach the same level as the troops that arrived here earlier.

United Press, Singapore, 16th. Observers here believe that the Roosevelt-Churchill joint declaration will enhance Thailand's resistance to Japanese pressure, because the declaration allows Anglo-American cooperation to curb aggression throughout the world. Senior authorities here said that this declaration was generally "expected to be aimed at Japan." What is worth noting is that in the past five days, the tension in Singapore has been slightly reduced. Newspaper reactions to the declaration vary. The "Straits Times" called it "the explosion of a wet firecracker" when everyone expected an explosion. The newspaper expressed disappointment that the declaration failed to show the extent of Anglo-American cooperation. The newspaper said, "We hoped that the declaration could take a firm stance against Japan and even issue a stern warning, telling it that it must stop aggression, otherwise it will be at odds with all of us, so that the situation in the Far East can be clarified." The newspaper believes that this English declaration has dispelled Japan's current fear of Anglo-American action in the Far East. The Japanese newspaper "Pioneer" interpreted the fourth declaration as a suggestion to Japan to "change its current course" in exchange for equal trading opportunities. The newspaper also said that this suggestion is worthy of the Japanese government's careful consideration.

### Fierce Fighting in Ukraine, Red Army Makes Strategic Retreat, Builds Strong Positions in the Dnieper River Bend, German Central Forces Encounter Heavy Losses

Reuters, London, 16th. Recent Soviet communiqués state that there is very fierce fighting in Ukraine. According to London informed sources, the situation in Ukraine will inevitably be chaotic before it stabilizes. However, it is generally believed that General Budyonny will be able to withdraw his main force across the Dnieper River and then establish a strong defense line on the right wing to the west. The German offensive against Ukraine does not seem to be as certain as before. Last night, a German military spokesman said that military operations in the area had not yet been completed, and German field correspondents strongly stated that the troops were facing difficulties due to the fierce resistance of the Soviet army and heavy rain.

Reuters, Moscow, 16th. Soviet acknowledgement of the abandonment of Kirovgrad and Pervomaysk shows that the German army has crossed the key railway starting from Odessa and is now threatening the main railway line starting from Nikolaev. In the next few days, it can be seen whether the German offensive will succeed and achieve its initial goal of occupying the important industrial area within the Dnieper River bend, which includes the iron ore center Krivoy Rog and the Dnepropetrovsk industrial area. The German side claimed to have occupied Krivoy Rog, which produces a large part of the Soviet Union's iron ore, but Moscow denied it. The extent to which the Soviet army led by General Budyonny will strategically withdraw from the western agricultural areas of Ukraine to more defensible and more important areas will be revealed in the next few days. There are already signs indicating that the Soviet army will contain the German army along the line protecting the industry and use both ends of the Dnieper River bend as supporting points. One of the two large points is near Kremenchug and the other is near Nikolaev or Kherson. The purpose of this withdrawal of Soviet troops seems to be to avoid large-scale battles in the western part of Ukraine that is not suitable for defense, and now to hold on to the Dnieper River bend. In addition, the people in the industrial area are not only deeply patriotic but also loyal to the current government that has made the area's industry developed and prosperous. The ancestors of these people are mostly famous Cossacks, strong, good at fighting, and freedom-loving, who have resisted the aggression of Poland and Turkey for hundreds of years. Gogol wrote books that made the deeds of these Cossacks immortal. The area within the Dnieper River bend accounts for one-half of Ukraine's total industry, and the rest is in the Don River basin and other places east of the area.

United Press, Moscow, 16th. An official message from the central front yesterday stated that there has been a drastic change in German strategy and they have now been forced to abandon their frontal attack on Moscow from Smolensk, because in the fierce fighting of the past thirty days, they have lost "tens of millions" of troops. At the same time, official communiqués stated that the Red Army engaged in fierce battles throughout the night in the Kholm, Staraya Russa, Smolensk, and Estonian regions. The Red Army air fleet assisted ground troops in attacking the enemy. The afternoon report from the High Command mentioned fierce battles in Smolensk and near three strongholds in Leningrad, which the Nazi forces are trying to encircle. The great battles in Ukraine were not mentioned.

### German Side Claims to Have Occupied Iron Ore Center in Ukraine

Reuters, London, 16th. The "Daily Mail" military commentator said that only Hitler and the German General Staff know whether the German offensive in southern Ukraine is a feint or a full-scale offensive. Judging from the current situation, the scale of the war is certainly quite large. In terms of mileage, the German right wing has made great progress. The Soviet side acknowledged that it had retreated from Pervomaysk and Kirovograd (120 miles north of Nikolaev), and seemed to be retreating to the back of the Dnieper Bay. The river is very difficult to cross. The Soviet retreat is obviously well-ordered, and there is no sign that the German army has approached the Dnieper River. The German side claimed to have occupied Krivoy Rog, the iron ore center southeast of Kirovograd. If this is true, the area is of no use to the German side, because what the German side needs is not iron ore, but oil. Even if the German army continues to make progress, it will inevitably find that the oil has been completely transported by the Soviet army. It is too early to say that the Soviet Union's communications have been cut off. The Soviet side can still transport troops by sea to reinforce and threaten the flanks of German traffic. There have been no significant changes in other parts of the front line, and there are no signs of launching a new offensive on a large scale. Soviet and German troops in the Smolensk and Kiev regions must be waiting for an opportunity to move. There is obviously some activity by Finnish troops, but there has been no major development.

### Nazi Blitzkrieg Tactics Fail, 6,000 Tanks Destroyed

TASS, Moscow, 16th. "Pravda" commented today that the German plan to break through alone with mechanized units has failed. In six weeks, the German side lost 15 brigades and 6,000 tanks were destroyed. The German side originally attacked with large tank units and infantry separately, but because this strategy has been defeated by the Red Army, suffering heavy losses, it has now had to change its strategy and attack with tanks and infantry together. The newspaper pointed out that at the beginning of the war, the German side often advanced with large mechanized units and infantry separately. The Red Army used this point to cut off their communications and defeat them separately. For example, the German 19th and 20th Tank Divisions were completely wiped out because of this. Finally, "Pravda" said that the situation in the German rear is unstable and it is impossible to compensate for the manpower and material losses suffered by the tank units.

### German Army Changes Strategy for Invasion of Soviet Union, Attempts to Cut Off Access to the Sea

Havas, Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 15th. Today is the fifty-fifth day since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. The general situation on all fronts is as follows: In the southern Ukrainian region, the German-Romanian allied forces are advancing steadily and have now reached Ask and Shmirke, 25 miles east of the port of Odessa on the Black Sea coast. At the same time, the vanguard of the German army is also advancing along the Bug River to a place less than twelve miles from the city of Nikolaev. Therefore, the people of Odessa and Nikolaev have had to evacuate. Another German force has advanced to Nikolopol, a famous manganese-producing area between the Dnieper River and Krivoy Rog. Fierce battles are currently underway. If the German army controls this area, it may be possible to attack the Crimean Peninsula. The Red Army encircled by the Black Sea ports is bravely retreating through the sea under enemy aircraft bombing. The war situation on the central front is more moderate, but Germany is intensifying its pressure on the Bryansk region. On the northern front, Finnish troops are attacking the northwest side of Lake Ladoga, allowing for the Vuksens and Sudavaara regions. The front line in the area is 150 miles long, and the Red Army has 50,000 soldiers and is strong. Looking at the overall war situation, it can be seen that the German army is trying to cut off the Soviet Union's entire access to the sea in the Baltic and Black Seas, isolating the Soviet Union from other parts of Europe.

United Press, London, 16th. Authoritative military commentators yesterday said that the German navy in the Black Sea cannot be considered strong, but the German military force in the Baltic Sea may threaten the Soviet fleet there. The commentator recalled that Germany could send warships through the Kiel Canal to attack Soviet warships. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union can transfer smaller warships such as submarines or destroyers from the Baltic Sea to the White Sea via the Stalin Canal.

### Soviet Union and Poland Sign Military Agreement: Southern Formation of Polish Army in Soviet Union; Molotov Receives Czech Envoy

Reuters, London, 16th: Last night, London officials announced that the Soviet-Polish military agreement was signed in Moscow yesterday afternoon. This agreement is based on the principles formulated in London by Polish Prime Minister Sikorski and his staff and carried to Moscow by the Polish mission. It stipulates the details of forming a Polish army in the Soviet Union.

TASS, Moscow, 16th: Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, received Czech official Mr. Filinger today.

Stalin's Eldest Son Establishes Merit: Appointed Captain of Artillery Company; Unparalleled Bravery in Combat

United Press, Moscow, 16th: Officials announced today that Stalin's eldest son, artillery company captain Shugeshvili, established merit in the Battle of Vitebsk near Smolensk after 30 days of combat. General Yeriomenko telegraphed that "Artillery Company Captain Shugeshvili showed true bravery and love for the motherland while fighting near Vitebsk. He fought bravely and did not leave his position until the last shell was loaded." Official documents revealed that Stalin's eldest and second sons fought alongside the sons of famous heroes, Ukrainian guerrilla leader Chapayev and Pak Hong-min. Both heroes' daughters are officers. Stalin's youngest son, David, was captured by the German army at the beginning of last month.

Malayan Overseas Chinese Families

Reuters, Singapore, 16th: Foreign Exchange Managers announced today that restrictions on remittances from Malayan overseas Chinese families, imposed after the freezing order, can be lifted starting today.

### Memories of Indian Poet Saint Tagore's Visit (3) Xu Baoqian

"In the distant shadows of the forest, the red sun sets towards the banks of the Saraswati River. The hermits' children return from the fields to the silent forest garden, leading their tired oxen to rest in the woods. In the courtyard of the thatched cottage, the fire of worship burns. The children, having bathed, gather in the courtyard, quietly listening to Master Gautama's teachings. In the sky, in the infinite space, the God of Peace sits idly, as if in meditation. The stars surround the God of Peace, as if listening to the God's teachings. Suddenly, the quiet forest trembles, and Master Gautama speaks: Children, Mendea, I will tell you Brahma Vidya. Atop the trees of Tapovana, dawn arrives. The children of the hermits, rising early to bathe, their golden hair reflecting like dewdrops in the morning light. They surround Master Gautama under the Bata tree. Amidst the crowing, the buzzing of bees, and the sound of flowing water, they sing the Sama song in unison."

From this, we can not only see Mr. Tagore's educational ideals, but also the philosophical foundation of Mr. Tagore's educational career.

Political Thought: Mr. Tagore's forest school was founded in 1901. Not long after, the national independence movement arose. Although Mr. Tagore sympathized with nationalism, he had already clearly seen its drawbacks. As early as 1901, Mr. Tagore had clearly said: "Nationalism is based on the blind pursuit of self-interest by each nation. So-called patriotism is nothing more than each nation's arrogance and contempt for other nations. It has a close connection with force and untruth.

In 1916, Mr. Tagore traveled to Japan and the United States. Seeing the peak of nationalism in both countries, he earnestly warned the people of both nations.

In 192x, Mr. Tagore came to China, and the Shanghai Japanese Residents Association held a meeting to welcome him. In his speech, Mr. Tagore said: "When I traveled to your country, I saw some Westernized politicians. Their purpose is nothing more than to expand their own country's power and exclude other countries. This narrow nationalistic ideology is the enemy of idealism and the natural result of the mechanization of life." In the same year, Mr. Tagore also said in a speech at the British-American Association in Beijing: "When I passed through Japan, I saw the so-called 'spoils of war' obtained from China openly displayed. I really don't understand what this boasting means. I also questioned several Japanese friends, and they said that this kind of education is necessary to prepare the people for foreign wars. They also said that in order to make the people love their country, it is necessary to arouse the people's hatred of foreign countries. However, in my opinion, this is nothing more than a revival of barbarism, and its consequences are very terrible. Fortunately, Japan has other lovable aspects. The ordinary people of Japan are extremely polite to people, they admire ancient customs, love a quiet life, and their lives show an artistic spirit everywhere. All of these are the opposite of belligerent nationalism."

Mr. Tagore also said: "In the United States, I also saw the same situation, the spirit of excluding foreigners can be seen everywhere. I don't think this is what a Christian country should have. Moreover, this spirit can lead mankind to the road of destruction. Even modern India has the same trend. When I pointed out the danger of this tendency to Indian nationalists, they blamed me for weakening the Indians. Because what they worship is the principle of survival of the fittest and the strong preying on the weak."

International Mission: Because of the prevalence of nationalism, after returning to China from Japan and the United States, Mr. Tagore deeply believed that it was necessary to promote ancient Indian culture. Therefore, at the end of 1918, he gathered his former students and friends in Santiniketan. At the meeting, Mr. Tagore announced his proposal to reorganize the original school to make it a center for promoting ancient Eastern civilization, and changed the school name to Visra-Bharati, taking the meaning of gathering world scholarship in one place (that is, the meaning of an international university). After the end of World War II, Mr. Tagore traveled to Europe again in 190x (according to Mr. Tagore, he traveled to Britain and Europe in 193x, that is, Mr. Tagore's trip to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature for writing Gitanjali), and was greatly welcomed by people from all walks of life in various countries. The result of this trip further strengthened his long-held belief that Eastern civilization can make important contributions to all mankind.

When Mr. Tagore was traveling in the United States (1916), he met a British youth, L.K. Elmhist, who volunteered to help Mr. Tagore with rural work. At this time, Mr. E. fulfilled his promise and came to work at Mr. Tagore's place. Therefore, when Mr. Tagore returned to China in January 192x, he formulated three great plans: (1) Promote Eastern civilization at the International University, (2) Experiment with rural improvement work near the International University, and (3) Promote human harmony and reconcile Eastern and Western cultures through the International University.

Late Years Honors: Mr. Tagore traveled to China in 1924 and to Soviet Russia in 1930 (details are included in the appendix to this article).

In May 1936, on the occasion of Mr. Tagore's 75th birthday, congratulatory telegrams came from all over the world, honoring Mr. Tagore as a great poet, great playwright, great novelist, social reformer, and religious master. In the summer of 1937, Mr. Tagore recovered from a serious illness. At the time of the Japanese invasion of China, Mr. Tagore drafted an article denouncing its brutality. In the winter of 1938, Mr. Tagore's paintings were exhibited in London. In May of this year, Oxford University in England broke with precedent and held an honorary ceremony in Santiniketan, where Mr. Tagore lived, and awarded him an honorary doctorate in literature. On August 7, Mr. Tagore died in Calcutta, and people from all over the world mourned him in unison.

Mr. Tagore was born into a prominent family, and his family produced many religious figures, philosophers, artists, and writers. Mr. Tagore was indeed the leader of the family, his brother Dwinidranath was a philosopher, and family members Sogonendranath and Abanmdranath were all artists. As for Mr. Tagore's daily living habits: his diet was mainly milk, sugar vegetables, and vegetables, but he did not eat meat. He got up early in the morning at all times of the year, and after getting up he would pray, praying for peace in the world. He would take a walk outdoors at sunrise, regardless of the cold or heat. He worked during the day, either reading books and writing poetry, or writing articles and painting. In the evening, he would gather male and female students to sing the poems and songs he had written, and the sound would overflow in all directions. When a new article was completed, he would give a lecture, and his voice was clear and loud, like the great bells.

### United States Strengthens Military Preparedness to Ensure National Security: Secretary of War Stimson Delivers Broadcast Stressing the Need to Extend Military Service

United Press, Washington, 16th: Secretary of War Stimson warned yesterday that "the Western Hemisphere is an unavoidable target of aggression by totalitarian countries," and that the world is now facing "the most dangerous threat in history." Mr. Stimson's remarks were broadcast to American soldiers, explaining the need to extend military service to 18 months. Mr. Stimson said that the government does not intend to send any expeditionary forces to fight for other countries. What the government is planning is to train a self-defense army to ensure the safety of the country. The danger is very real and rapid. Any government that does not take this step is shirking its responsibility. Mr. Stimson also said that Germany, Italy, and Japan are all thinking of conquering the world and trying to restore the "customs of the Dark Ages."

Havas, Washington, 15th: Secretary of War Stimson recently issued a message to the army, stating that the United States is training troops to defend the country and prevent it from being attacked. The most dangerous place in the Americas is actually South America and Central America. If the Axis air force and the "Fifth Column" cooperate to gain a foothold on the South American coast, it will be difficult for us to deal with it. Moreover, after the enemy establishes a foothold in Central or South America, it will be easy to bomb the Panama Canal. There are many signs that the Axis powers are invading South America. The authorities of Latin American countries have repeatedly uncovered foreign espionage conspiracies, which are examples of this. Germany is now in a very difficult situation. If it cannot advance and plunder new spoils, it will have internal unrest and defeat. German spies have been very active in the Western Hemisphere recently. The direction of the country's future actions is self-evident. The situation in Japan in the Far East is also the same. The country has already stationed a large army in China, and is now seeking new developments to the south. Moreover, the country's joining the Axis alliance is clearly aimed at infringing on us and our interests. The natural resources of our Western Hemisphere are also the ultimate target of its aggression. If our government still does not take steps to protect the country, it will be violating the interests of the people.

### United States Passes National Defense Budget of 75 Billion Yuan

Reuters, Washington, 16th: The House of Representatives passed an amended national defense budget bill of 7,575,000,000 yuan yesterday.

Reuters, Washington, 16th: The amended national defense budget bill passed by the House of Representatives was also passed by the Senate. Now this bill has been submitted to the White House for the President's signature.

Reuters, Washington, 16th: A joint committee of the House and Senate has agreed to allocate 750,000,000 yuan to manufacture tanks and other war equipment. Before the decision, the chairman of the committee received a letter from Secretary of War Stimson, stating that the manufacture of tanks and other equipment is of great importance to national security. Senator Adams told people that on Thursday night, the Senate withdrew from the national defense budget of 6,883,000 yuan, but now it has agreed to allocate 75,000,000 yuan.

### U.S. Army Enlistees Undergo Physical Examinations: 6 Million Rejected Due to Unsoundness

International News Service, Washington, 16th: Federal Security Administrator McNutt suggested yesterday that an estimated six million enlistees have been rejected due to poor physical condition, so the Selective Service Act should be changed. Mr. McNutt said that "America's reproductive power" has been "disappointing." Mr. McNutt is now proceeding to request Congress to allocate funds to treat those who have been rejected so that they can also be trained. According to Mr. McNutt's plan, local officials should first allow those who have been rejected to improve their physical condition within a specified period of time, and then give them a second examination. Mr. McNutt said that those who are rejected due to unsound physical condition account for 40 percent, but the conscription office said it is 32 percent.

### Tagore Broadcast Denounces Vichy Government: Free French Launch "T" Movement to Use Material Means to Resist and Attack the Enemy

Reuters, Beirut, 16th: General Tagore broadcast last night in response to Marshal Pétain, saying, "We, from this side of the Mediterranean, reiterate our assurance to serve France and seek France's liberation." Mr. Tagore, representing the Free French who will never surrender or cooperate with the enemy, denounced the policies of Vichy, saying that the Free French continue to fight for revenge, greatness, and freedom, and that the Germans, who win by unexpected and rapid action, will eventually not be able to escape their fate.

Reuters, London, 16th: After the V for Victory movement, the T for Traitor movement followed. A Free French radio announcer recently suggested in a broadcast that the letter T be used to represent traitors. The letter T should be painted on the doors of French people who serve the Germans. The letter T is the first letter of Traitor. According to the Free French intelligence agency, the first traitor mentioned by the announcer was a wholesaler named Van Li at 33 Monk Street in Bordeaux, France, who goes to non-occupied France every week to buy 30 to 35 tons of meat to sell to the Germans. This matter was announced during the broadcast at 9 p.m. on August 5. The next morning, 3,000 women in Bordeaux angrily destroyed Van Li's residence. The traitor was punished so quickly, which the announcer did not expect at first.

### South American Countries Prepare to Receive Axis Ships

Havas, New York, 15th: The Commercial Daily recently reported that the countries of South America will take over 70 percent (about 400,000 tons) of all ships of the Axis countries currently docked in South American ports. However, Argentina has notified the belligerent countries that it is prepared to purchase these ships to facilitate navigation.

### 300 British Planes Launch Large-Scale Attack on Germany: Hanover Engulfed in Flames, Visible from 50 Miles Away

United Press, London, 16th: Official communiqués revealed yesterday that more than 300 British planes bombed German territory and German-occupied areas on Thursday night. According to the Air Ministry, multiple fires broke out in Hanover, Brunswick, Magdeburg, and other places after the bombing. The shipyards in Rotterdam and the port of Boulogne were also bombed. The communiqué said that the heat was particularly great in Hanover. Fires could be seen 50 miles away and by airmen during flight. During the air raid, British planes flew in large formations over the cities of Prussia, and the planes used were Manchester planes, four-engine Stirling planes, and Halifax bombers.

### German Long-Range Guns Bomb British Ships

United Press, Folkestone, 16th: German long-range guns bombed British ships in the Strait of Dover last night for nearly an hour. The guns fired two shots per minute. The long-range guns began firing when the ships were discovered as the dense fog dissipated.

### Food - Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Price Suddenly Rises Eight Yuan - Grain Hoarders Overjoyed

The foreign rice market turned tight the day before yesterday, and the sentiment remained buoyant yesterday. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Municipal Council's small grain public sale price suddenly rose by 8 yuan to 124 yuan. It is also rumored that the 40,000 to 50,000 bags of rice they have in stock have also been raised in price in succession before and yesterday. Retail and wholesale prices are close to the market price, immediately causing excitement among the speculator gangs. Local grain hoarders also took the opportunity to hoard, their faces beaming with joy beyond description. The shouting started again, and the situation became chaotic again. The bank's warehouse small grain price jumped to 127 yuan, and foreign warehouses to 126.5 yuan. Other No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon cargoes all soared. No. 1 Saigon high-grade cargoes opened at 139 yuan, the general market at 136-137 yuan, and central warehouses at 134-135 yuan. No. 2 was at 127.5 yuan, and old goods at 129 yuan. Central warehouse No. 2 Siam was at 121.5 yuan, Gia Vot rice at 135.5 yuan, high-grade Min Dang at 139 yuan, central warehouses at 134-135 yuan, and secondary grades at 129 yuan to 127.5 yuan. At this point, general retailers slowed down purchases due to the shocking prices, while most speculators, seeing that the rising trend had weakened, rushed to sell at high prices, and the market softened again. Various prices fell by one yuan, with the bank's warehouse small grain price at 126 yuan, and foreign warehouses at 125 yuan and 124.5 yuan. This situation persisted for a long time until near the close of the market, when new major hoarders emerged and absorbed the supply, causing the market to tighten again. Therefore, the closing price was still about one yuan higher than the previous market. As for the current stock in Shanghai warehouses, it is known to be 1.21797 million bags. The Shanghai Municipal Council is still selling, and the auction price is still lower than the market price. However, rice shops in the French Concession, due to the price limit set by the French Municipal Council, have a large price difference and are unwilling to buy. Since the market lacks actual sales, it is unknown whether the speculator gangs can sustain their business. However, recently, rice merchants have been trying to use the "Southward Advance" as a pretext to make a move. The Shanghai Municipal Council rice price rose eight yuan without saying a word, which is nothing short of providing ammunition for rice weevils and hoarders, giving them a reason to argue loudly and add fuel to the fire. It is hoped that the Shanghai Municipal Council will act cautiously in the future, so that rice hoarders will not laugh behind their backs, and the public will not be disappointed, thinking that this is just business.

Thick and thin japonica national rice was stimulated by the movements in foreign rice, and the arrival of goods suddenly became scarce again, which made local shops more eager to stock up. The owners took the opportunity to raise prices, and prices rebounded by two to three yuan. South China's fresh early and late indica rice opened at 55 yuan, or 154.5 yuan. Wuxi's original-package special japonica rice was at 54-55 yuan, and lodging and secondary grades were attached at 17 yuan to 114 yuan. Only ten stones of new Pudong japonica rice arrived, and in the context of strong sales, it was not enough to distribute. Therefore, the goods were sold at the current time when goods were scarce and valuable, and prices immediately rose by more than three yuan, with the opening price at 60 yuan to 159 yuan.

Glutinous rice also followed suit in this favorable situation, and prices generally rose by about one yuan. Hong Kong white yuan high-grade opened at 129 yuan, and secondary grades at 125 yuan. Glutinous tea was at 117 yuan to 114 yuan. As for national glutinous rice, no transactions were heard due to a lack of goods.

Flour Market Steadily Rises

Yesterday's spot foreign flour market saw continuous gains in sales from the northern and southern foreign transshipment gangs. Although arrivals were continuous, the rising exchange rates and the news that the Shanghai Municipal Council increased the price of flat-rate rice both excited people. Speculators inside and outside the industry took the opportunity to push up prices with all their might. Although the newly arrived goods of the Golden Dragon brand are in the Pudong warehouse, they are quite popular with buyers due to their better quality. The opening price was 33 yuan and a ball and corner, gun powder flour at 3.394-6 yuan, and banana flour at 34.1-4 yuan. A total of more than 30,000 bags were traded, and the selling price was increased by six to seven corners compared to the previous day.

Oil Market - Soybean Oil Market Not Public - Only Rapeseed Oil and Clear Oil Are Traded - Hoarding is Even More Effective

Yesterday's edible oil market saw soybean oil still hoarded and not traded. The buying interest in rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil remained strong. Both the Dah You factory's clear oil and the Ri Hua factory's rapeseed oil opened at 200 yuan. Subsequently, the market slightly eased as profit-taking hoarders sold off their stocks. As a result, the price rose by one and a half to five yuan compared to the previous day. A total of more than 1,000 dan of Dah You factory's clear oil, 600 dan of rapeseed oil, more than 2,000 dan of Ri Hua factory's rapeseed oil, 300 dan of Li De factory's rapeseed oil, 100 barrels of Yoshida factory's rapeseed oil, and 50 barrels of Da Sheng factory's rapeseed oil were traded (price details in the market price column).

The price of soybeans continued to rise. Yesterday, because those holding the goods continued to hoard, there were very few sellers, and the price rose by another one or two yuan. The general market saw the Main Street and South China gangs buy 500 bags of degummed Jiaozhou soybeans at a price of 59.8 yuan, 100 bags of Qingkou soybeans at a price of 58 yuan, and 300 bags of Guide soybeans at a price of 56 yuan to 57.2 yuan.

Financial Settlement Still Strong - Foreign Exchange Tightens

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw tight exchange rates. At 9:30 AM, only the Hong Kong exchange rate was lowered to 125, amounting to 19 yuan. French, German, and Japanese exchange rates were still inactive. The British and American exchange rates remained level. The black market for British and American exchange rates remained tight. After the morning opening, banks offered little supply, causing the American dollar exchange rate in the foreign bank to fall from 4.78125 to 4.75 at one point. The British pound had no price. The HSBC small counter's American dollar exchange rate remained at 4.8125, and the buying pressure stopped. However, after 10:00 AM, HSBC suddenly settled imports for sugar and hardware merchants, and the HSBC small counter's American dollar exchange rate also changed to 4.75. The market tightened again until the close, with both exchange rates rising again compared to the previous day. Trading was not very active. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Sino-American Commercial Sales Have Strong Supply

Since this morning's foreign wire report, the silver market in England, America, and India has not changed. The American exchange rate against the British pound was lowered by 0.25, and the American exchange rate against Shanghai was lowered by 0.02. The rest were unchanged. The central exchange rate remained level. In the morning opening, the selling prices of banks were level. The spot British exchange rate was 1 shilling 875, and the American dollar was 4.815 yuan. The importing foreign bank came and bought August at 4.78125 yuan. After the American bank supplied, sales stopped, and the market softened to 4.75 yuan.

The price rose sharply to 4.84375 yuan. The silver balance tax remained slightly at 24.25%. HSBC suddenly absorbed American dollars at 4.8125 yuan on behalf of importers. The market became hot again, and importing foreign banks competed to absorb the supply. Near noon, Chinese and American banks showed some willingness to supply, so the market stabilized. At the noon close, the spot and September futures British exchange rate was 2 shillings 84375, and the American dollar was 4.78125 yuan, both rising by 0.03125.

Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises by Two Yuan

The Gold Rush Intensifies - Spot Gold Nears 9,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday's gold market saw intense activity in the black market, with the waves still dangerous and the fluctuations violent and unexpected. After rising, the market once fell sharply, then resumed its upward trend. After returning to the 7,200 yuan mark, it jumped out again. People were a little uneasy. The HSBC small counter's American dollar exchange rate initially remained at 4.8125, and the black market turned from tight to level. There was a lot of infighting in the market, and the price rose to 7,230 yuan. It once retreated sharply to 7,170 yuan. Unexpectedly, HSBC suddenly bought American dollars on behalf of importers, and the market tightened again. Amid the closing price frenzy of gold shops and securities firms, it rose again to 7,265 yuan, an increase of 96 yuan. The volume of trading in half a day was 140,000 to 150,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The spread (August to September) selling price offered by Cheng Da reached 25 yuan. The spot gold price rose sharply again.

Gold jewelry rose by 20 yuan, reaching a peak of 921 yuan, which has never been reached before.

Futures Gold Rises Sharply by Nearly 100 Yuan

Since this morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 9:15 AM and immediately rose to 7,185 yuan, an increase of 33 yuan. Then, it retreated from 7,190 yuan to 7,180 yuan. The foreign exchange reported tight, and it was difficult to settle at 4.78125 yuan for the American dollar. People were encouraged, and amid the buying pressure from Tong Kangyong, Xianghe, Yifeng, and Yida, retail investors followed suit and pushed up the price by 50 yuan to 7,230 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that the HSBC small counter's Wan Yuan remained at 4.8125, and the black market also turned cheap. Retail investors rushed to sell, and Xinfengyong, Yida, Yifeng, Yiyuan, and Defu all sold, causing a sharp drop of 20 yuan to 7,170 yuan. Dafeng, Hengji, Chida, and Dingsheng absorbed the supply at the lower price, so the price gradually rebounded. After 10:30 AM, HSBC absorbed American dollars at 4.8125 yuan, suddenly turning tight, and the price soared above 7,200 yuan. Yida, Chengji, and Defu bought aggressively, soaring to 7,218 yuan. Yili, Yiyuan, Xiangxingyong, Xinyuan, and Xinfengyong competed to sell at the high price, retreating to 7,215 yuan. The price then rose again due to the buying pressure from gold shops and securities firms. The market closed at noon at 7,248 yuan, an increase of 96 yuan compared to the previous day's closing, representing a squeeze of 35 yuan.

Japanese gold notes and Korean notes continued to rise, with the former rising to 1.48 yuan and the latter rising to 1.9 yuan. In addition, notes from Singapore, Robbie, Canada, the Philippines, Australian gold, and Siam all tended to rise.

### Securities - Government Bonds Fall Frequently - New Low Prices Seen Repeatedly

The government bond black market gradually declined yesterday. Class A bonds broke the 6 yuan mark, Class B bonds broke the 1 yuan mark, Class C bonds once broke 7 yuan, and Class E once broke 6 yuan, the new low price since the Class A bond lottery. It is clear that there are very few who borrow to short. Most of the large numbers that appear are actual goods flowing out, with no need to cover, so trading is greatly reduced. Most of the trading now done in the market is by long speculators, with Class A longs selling, and the market falling. Class B longs are trapped, and Class B are sold to Class C, in a cycle. Occasionally, new longs join, and the market is slightly better, but actual goods are sold off when the opportunity arises, so there is not much hope for the future. The root cause is that there has been a sudden change in the 11th installment of principal and interest due at the end of July, causing people to doubt. Yesterday was Saturday, and only one session was held in the morning. Runli and Runde bought slightly more, followed by Lianyi and Lianhe. Tianxing bought Class A bonds, but Hongda and Zhongfu Bank and Xinhua Bank supplied a lot. Xiexingyuan and Defu also had actual goods flowing out. The market price felt sluggish from the opening, and all markets broke through a level. The situation had weakened, and the results were all down by 0.3, 0.5, or 0.6 yuan. The total volume of transactions was less than 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading saw 100 shares of the New New Company traded at a price of 28.25 yuan.

London, 15th (Friday) - The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British companies' stocks remained level today. Bank stocks alone showed weakness. The Macau Bank stock rebounded by 1 shilling 3 pence to 8 pounds 18 shillings 9 pence. HSBC Bank shares each rose by 1 pound, with the London registered share price at 74 pounds and the Hong Kong registered share price at 77 pounds. There were bids, no offers, and no other changes.

Coal - White Coal Dust Increases by 10 Yuan - Still Not Willing to Sell Much - Fu Coal Balls Will Continue to Rise

Hongji No. 2 white coal dust, the only raw material for coal balls, had abundant supplies arriving in Shanghai in the past two months, and the warehouses were very full. Currently, the managing firms are using the pretext that the cost of later goods is high, and the price of coal dust has risen from 330 yuan to 340 yuan, and has increased by another 10 yuan, but they are still not willing to sell much. Therefore, it is rumored in the market that coal balls will soon continue to rise in price, which is not a worrying factor.

### Cotton Yarn: Raw Cotton and "Power Too Strong," Transactions Outside the Market Reach 1,700 Yuan

The yarn market started flat and continued to rise, but the upward trend was very strong. This was because the price of 32-count single yarn was high, and at the same time, the price of raw cotton was also rising strongly. As a result, speculators concentrated on buying, and for a time, there were not enough chips to distribute. As for the shorts, most of them reversed their positions to long. As a result, the market gradually rose. However, actual sales of 20-count yarn were still very few, but the recent increase was very significant. Once those who have made profits sell, a sharp reaction is feared and must be guarded against. Unexpectedly, people's hearts are currently enthusiastic, and the public's attention is focused on cotton yarn. The high price for 20-count Double Horse brand was 1,684 yuan, and the low price was 1,643 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the usual weekend market closure, several dozen bales were traded in the unofficial market, reaching over 1,700 yuan. Afterwards, 1,695 yuan could not be sold, exceeding the high price of 1,685 yuan on the 28th of last month. The exchange will officially open for business next Monday. Speculators buy more as prices rise and sell heavily when prices fall. It is reported that 670 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.

Double Horse brand opened in the morning, and due to rumors that cotton yarn could not be shipped from the Burma Road, some people's confidence was shaken. The opening price was only 1,643 yuan, but sellers in the market were not aggressive, and the market rebounded, gradually rising. It was then heard that the exchange was buying in large quantities, and the market rose further, with buying interest even stronger, rising step by step to 1,684 yuan. In the middle, due to profit-taking, it fell back to 1,676 yuan. The closing price was 1,682 yuan. It is reported that the turnover for the half-day was 7,685 bales. The amount of purchases by various groups is listed below: Hong Kong 185, Fellow traders 7, Our statistics 7,650.

The Yarn Industry Joint Exchange will start business on the 18th of this month. The business hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily, with the afternoon temporarily closed. The location is on the upper floor of the current yarn market in Tonghe Gully.

The gold futures market again experienced a sharp and violent rise amidst the softening of American cotton. At the opening this morning, due to the strength of dyed cloth and factory orders, futures prices immediately rose by more than ten yuan. The sentiment in the futures yarn market was revitalized, with longs frequently adding to their positions and shorts feeling shaky and eagerly covering their positions. In addition, with the manipulation of speculators, the entire market was dominated by buying interest, and the supply of chips was short. Market prices rose continuously, showing a tendency to soar. The August contract opened at 1,485 yuan, a slight increase of two yuan; the September contract was 1,576 yuan, an increase of eight yuan; the October contract was 1,591 yuan, a gain of seven yuan. Afterwards, due to the continuous surge in factory orders, and rumors of Hong Kong buyers purchasing fine yarn, demand increased sharply, and the potential for price increases expanded. Shorts, seeing the unfavorable situation, rushed to cover their positions, and buying interest was strong. The August contract rose to a new high of 1,509 yuan, the September contract to 1,595 yuan, and the October contract to 1,608 yuan. Due to some profit-taking selling by the longs, there was a normal small correction of three to six yuan. The afternoon closing prices were: August contract 1,503 yuan, September contract 1,589 yuan, and October contract 1,607 yuan, each up 20 to 23 yuan from the previous day. Turnover for the August contract was 1,880 bales, for the September contract 5,230 bales, and for the October contract 5,150 bales, totaling 13,260 bales. This was a decrease of 3,870 bales from the previous day. In the afternoon, due to Saturday events, and the quantity of three-month accounts ending on the 15th was 22,620 bales, including 3,910 bales for August, 9,540 bales for September, and 9,170 bales for October. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the morning half-day are recorded below (net closing prices):

Cotton Prices Pushed Higher and Higher, Exceeding Overseas Order Prices

The current cotton situation has a solid base and prices are high, but speculators are pushing prices aggressively, so the upward trend is strong. However, prices have been pushed above overseas order prices, and the supply of cotton is still smooth. It is inevitable that things have gone too far. However, this is often the style of speculators, who want to push prices high enough. Once they release, prices will plummet. Therefore, yesterday's turnover was slightly lower than before, and many holders are still unwilling to sell at this high point. New highs are intermittently being reached. The market prices are recorded below:

The buyer is responsible for handling the delivery permits for shipments arriving successively in August and September.

New York cotton market, telegram of the 15th. The market rose initially due to purchases by traders, then fell back due to long liquidation and sales by the New Orleans group. As a result, both futures and spot prices fell by three to eight points from the previous day. Spot Middling cotton sold for 16.65 cents per pound, equivalent to 379.62 yuan per picul in the local market.

Also from New York, the Bureau of Statistics released the following cotton industry statistics for July in the United States (unit for cotton cloth: thousand bales; unit for spindles: thousand): Item | July This Year | July Last Year | Cotton Cloth Consumption | 929 | 598 | Seed Cotton Consumption | 124 | 80 | Cotton Cloth Exports | 33 | 120 | Cotton Cloth Inventory at Factories | 1,874 | 974 | Cotton Cloth Inventory at Warehouses | 9,704 | 9,122 | Spindles in Operation | 23,028 | 12,917

Also, a telegram of American cotton statistics from August 1st to 15th this year is recorded below (per bale of 500 pounds): Cumulative Arrivals | 268,000 bales | Cumulative Factory Use | 356,000 bales | Cumulative Exports | 28,000 bales | Total Inventory at All Ports | 3,248,000 bales

The Bombay Indian cotton telegram did not arrive yesterday. According to its unofficial market prices, prices fell by 2.5 rupees. Broach cotton sold for 262 rupees, equivalent to 199.91 yuan per picul in the local market.

Piece Goods: Factory Prices Firm, Fine Yarn Fabrics Rise Sharply by 1-2 Yuan

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market started flat and continued to rise, with selling prices rising steadily. This was because factory prices were very firm, and traders' sentiment changed rapidly, causing the prices of customer cloth to rise by about one yuan per piece. Fine yarn goods were seen as particularly popular, with prices rising by a huge one to two yuan. Transactions for customer sales and hoarding were stimulated again. Over 800 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street, including over 500 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, twill, and colored cloth by the Guangdong-Hong Kong dealers, over 100 pieces of fine twill and coarse cloth by the Zhejiang-Anhui dealers, and several hundred pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and printed goods by the Jiangsu dealers. On the 17th, 1,230 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: Selling prices fluctuated briefly and then rose sharply. As a result, Dragon Head fine cloth rose by 8.5 jiao, medium fine cloth rose by 7.5 jiao, twill rose by 5 jiao, and drill rose by 4 to 6.75 fen per yard. Old orders and old taxes opened at 1.88 yuan and closed at 1.915 yuan. Futures cloth for Dragon Head on the exchange rose by 1.2 to 3 yuan for each month.

Feather Yarn and Satin Also Rise

Woolen fabrics, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter goods, are still continuing to rise in price. The main reason is that the arrival of foreign goods is becoming increasingly difficult, and the output of factory goods is gradually lacking. Both domestic and foreign hoarders are eager. Silk-like feather yarn and electric satin used for lining Western suits have also recently increased in price due to factory payments and cost relationships. Yesterday, the top-grade Yuanchang camel grey assorted electric satin rose to 3.8 yuan per yard, the second grade was 3 yuan, wax money silk-like feather yarn was 2.8 yuan, and wax yarn sold for 2.23 yuan.

Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Rise Across the Board

Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market continued to be tight, with prices rising from one yuan to 4.5 yuan. Company futures for 24 coarse white sugar for delivery on August 20 were 116.6 yuan, 115.7 yuan, and 116.7 yuan, up one yuan. Futures for the end of August were 117.5 yuan, 118.4 yuan, and 118.6 yuan, up 1.4 yuan. The association's quote for spot 24 coarse white sugar was particularly firm. August arrivals were 118 yuan, 118.5 yuan, and 119.5 yuan, up 2.5 yuan. July arrivals were 117.5 yuan, 118 yuan, 119 yuan, and 119.4 yuan, up 2.4 yuan. June arrivals were 117 yuan, 117.5 yuan, and 118.8 yuan, up 2.3 yuan. April arrivals were 114.7 yuan, later jumping to 118 yuan. Dutch red sugar was also tight. KD mark was 110 yuan to 111 yuan, up 2 yuan. NT mark was 106.5 yuan to 108 yuan, up 1.5 yuan. Taikoo refined white, B mark was 145 yuan to 148 yuan, up 4 yuan. HX mark was 119 yuan, 119.5 yuan, 120.5 yuan, and 122 yuan, up 3.5 yuan. Road goods were 124 yuan. H mark refined red sugar was 101.5 yuan to 102 yuan, up 2 yuan. Road goods were 103 yuan. CC mark refined ice sugar was 135 yuan. Local factory No. 1 ice sugar was 148 yuan. Jingming ice sugar was 150 yuan, up 5 yuan. Futures turnover was over 21,000 bags, and spot turnover was over 3,000 bags.

Miscellaneous: Cigarettes Resold to Southeast Asia, Market Prices Difficult to Control

The recent rise in cigarette prices has been like a horse off the leash, with buying prices setting unprecedented records. This is because the exchange rate is tight, factories are restricting shipments, and due to hoarding, spot goods are inherently scarce. Furthermore, factories are shipping large quantities to Singapore, resulting in delayed shipments in Shanghai. Demand from all parties is very strong, and sales are rare, so the market is advancing madly. Yesterday, the market opening price for Great Britain brand was as high as 2,030 yuan per case, Old Knife brand was 1,690 yuan, Five Flowers brand was 1,160 yuan, Little Fairy brand was 1,330 yuan, Pin Hai brand was 1,470 yuan, 50-pack Big Front Door was 600 yuan per 10,000, Big Beautiful brand medium case was 1,050 yuan, and Golden Rat brand medium case was 730 yuan, all up 250 to 200 yuan from Wednesday.

Hardware: Pig Iron Sales Brisk

Pig iron is what southerners call black iron sheet, which is three feet wide and six feet long, also known as 3x6 feet black iron sheet. The number of sheets ranges from three to thirteen, and there are also eighteen sheets (thin goods). Recently, sales have been brisk due to purchases by local water bottle factories, printing factories, and machinery factories. Although sales to out-of-town dealers are difficult to sustain, local factory sales are not sluggish, so the market atmosphere has not been dull. Transactions are still quite lively, leading holders to be very confident, and standard market prices are unusually firm. Yesterday, various grades such as Nos. 5, 6, and 7 were quoted at over 310 yuan per picul, an increase of about 20 yuan from the previous market.

### Significant Meaning of the Anglo-American Declaration, Shanghai Residents Gain a Deep Understanding, Far East Policy Will Be More Determined, Japanese Newspapers Also Acknowledge the Extreme Seriousness of the Situation

After the talks between US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill concluded, a joint declaration was issued on the afternoon of the 14th, listing eight principles, declaring that the two countries had no aggressive ambitions, opposed changing the status quo, wished for the restoration of sovereignty and government to invaded countries, adhered to the principles of equal prosperity and free trade, and resolved to reduce armaments and establish lasting peace after the elimination of Nazi tyranny. The eighth item stated that the two countries would disarm the aggressor nations before ending the war. After this news spread around the world, all righteous people expressed excitement and welcomed it as a boon for China, believing that the time for Britain and the United States to use force to sanction Japan was not far off, and that the foundation for China's victory had been laid. Yesterday, all Western newspapers in Shanghai published articles commenting on the joint declaration, all sharing this view, and unanimously believing that the United States had almost declared war on the Axis countries, and that the two countries' policy towards Japan would be more determined in the future, preventing Japan from echoing the Nazis and continuing its adventurous actions. Even the editorials in the two Japanese newspapers in Shanghai openly acknowledged this. The main points of the newspapers' comments are extracted and translated below.

US Action No Different from Declaring War: Mainland Press Comments The Shanghai 大陸報 newspaper commented: The meeting between the two great powers of Britain and the United States clearly shows the world that there is no basis for compromise between aggressors and those who have been invaded. These eight principles are the common goals of Britain and the United States. To achieve these goals, those who fight for freedom must overcome all difficulties and destroy the aggressors' conspiracy to dominate the world. This action by the United States is no different from declaring war on the aggressors and only awaits the right time to act. Although the Axis powers regard the joint declaration as a "threatening propaganda," could this important meeting be a mere show? Although there have been disputes over Wilson's Fourteen Points, believing that it did not guarantee a fair peace nor prevent the outbreak of another war, the current eight principles are concise and to the point, and can avoid further disputes. The impact of this important meeting on the Far East has been greatly concerned by Washington and London. In the future, the two countries' policy towards Japan will be more determined. The grand strategy decided at this meeting will eliminate the value of Japan's assistance to Nazi Germany.

Future Actions Depend on Facts: The English-language Shanghai Evening Post commented: The German people and government now believe that an armistice is impossible. Since the minds of the people in the Axis countries have always been manipulated by their governments, and the people controlling the government have already decided to continue fighting, the joint declaration by Roosevelt and Churchill was not intended to alienate the people of the Axis countries from their governments. Therefore, the declaration must have other reasons and practical plans, such as how the United States will transport supplies to Britain, and how it will deal with places like Dakar and Azov. What future actions will Britain and the United States take in the Far East? What steps and sanctions should be taken against further Japanese aggression? All will often be answered with facts. People around the world may receive quick and full answers. If so, the meeting of the two great powers of the Atlantic will have a more satisfactory result than the meeting of the two great powers of Germany and Italy at the Brenner Pass.

Laying the Foundation for Lasting Peace: The Shanghai 字林西報 North-China Daily News commented: The meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill will undoubtedly become the most significant event in the history of the war. The eight principles announced, one of which is the war's purpose, is to destroy Nazi tyranny. The other seven points of peace are to clarify the principles of democratic countries' fight against aggression. Although these eight principles are slightly similar to Wilson's Fourteen Points, they have an even greater importance, that is, after this war can be ended on terms acceptable to democratic countries, all small and weak nations in the world will regain their freedom. Therefore, according to the peace plan drafted by Roosevelt and Churchill, the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles will not be repeated. Therefore, it has been decided to completely disarm the German people, who are not yet politically mature, so as to reduce the burden of armaments for peace-loving nations. Now that Britain and the United States have made this decision, they will encourage all kinds of people around the world to achieve freedom, stability, and improvement, and lay a permanent foundation for peace. Although achieving this goal is quite difficult, it must be achieved before it can be ended.

Future Resolve Against Japan: The Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun commented on Britain: Although the US-British joint declaration appears moderate when viewed abstractly, its purpose is to try to win over various countries and include them in their own camp to encircle Germany. This shows that Britain and the United States have adopted a positive attitude towards this war. Although there is talk of equal opportunities for trade or economy with Japan, this statement can only be interpreted as expressing dissatisfaction with the occupied areas of China. Other than that, nothing else has been mentioned, which shows that Britain and the United States clearly intend to adopt a policy of defeating the Axis powers one by one. Since the outbreak of the European war, their goal has been to defeat Germany, so they still seem to be pursuing a policy of appeasement towards Japan. However, on the other hand, they are promoting the ABCD line, and the US naval authorities have declared that they do not hesitate to fight on two oceans. Britain has also sent warships to the Pacific and is preparing for war against Japan. Although they still seem to be adopting a policy of appeasement towards Japan on the surface, since the heads of both military forces are attending this meeting, it is difficult to guarantee that there is no considerable conspiracy against Japan. Therefore, although this declaration can be said to be the Monroe Doctrine of the Western Hemisphere, in an emergency, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not make a decision to use force, regardless of whether it is in the Eastern or Western Hemisphere. Therefore, how Britain and the United States will act in the future is something that we should also be deeply concerned about.

Almost Certainly Fighting in Two Oceans: The Japanese-language Mainland News Evaluation stated: Regarding the war's purpose, the Anglo-American joint declaration's content is completely limited to Wilson's old system, which is now reaffirmed. It does not have any new ideals or intentions for rebuilding the world. It only wants to maintain the status quo as firmly as possible. President Roosevelt's purpose is to prevent Britain and Germany from concluding a separate peace. Churchill is deeply afraid that Germany will concentrate its forces to attack Britain, so he wants to use this to tie up the United States so that it can help Britain fight. After the joint declaration was issued, it can be said that both sides' intentions have been satisfied. Since they are in complete agreement, the United States will eventually participate in the war. It is only a matter of time. Since Britain and the Soviet Union concluded a military agreement, stipulating that the two sides would never conclude a separate peace with Germany, and now Britain and the United States have issued a joint declaration, it can be asserted that Britain will never conclude a peace with Germany. It will definitely unite with the Soviet Union to deal with Germany. Therefore, in order to achieve its desire to dominate the world, the United States will drive Britain and the Soviet Union to be its outposts and will actively assist Britain. At the same time, it will provide military assistance to the Soviet Union and will use British and American military bases in the Far East when necessary. As for this declaration, it is, of course, a silent encirclement of Japan in the Far East. Since the United States has decided to participate in the war, it will not be different in its attitude towards the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In the future, strategically, it may adopt a positive offensive in the Atlantic Ocean and a negative offensive in the Pacific Ocean.

### Public Concession Business Tax, Levied at Two Levels by the Municipal Council, Original Plan Drafted by the New Tax Source Committee, To Be Discussed at Tomorrow's Finance Meeting

The Japanese-language Mainland News reported that the Municipal Council's Finance Committee had scheduled a meeting for 4:30 PM on the 18th at the Municipal Council meeting hall to discuss the first-ever levy of business tax in the Public Concession. According to the Public Concession constitution, the Yangjingbang Land Charter, there were strict provisions regarding the scope of the Municipal Council's levies, licensing fees, and also regulations regarding the amount of tax levied. Recently, the Public Concession's administrative organs have expanded and various expenditures have increased, so the Municipal Council feels that its income is insufficient every year. This

Business Tax Plan was drafted by the New Tax Source Committee. The French Concession authorities, in order to make up for financial losses, also levied business tax at the beginning of this year, which was divided into A and B levels. Those belonging to level A were theaters, movie theaters, shops, warehouses, factories, etc., with a standard of 2,400 yuan based on the assessed value of the house, and the business tax was levied at 8%. When it exceeded 2,400 yuan, the excess amount was levied at 6%. Those belonging to level B were the offices of various banks and companies, the offices of various exchanges, law offices, insurance companies, hospitals, and other general freelancers, also with a standard of

1,400 yuan based on the assessed value of the house, and the business tax was levied at 12%. When it exceeded this amount, the excess amount was levied at 10%. Therefore, the future Public Concession business tax will be roughly classified into A and B levels in the same way as the French Concession, but it will be based on an assessed value of 3,000 yuan, and the tax rate will be 10% for level A, and 8% for the excess amount, and 15% for level B, and 12% for the excess amount. Therefore, after the implementation of this business tax, the Municipal Council can increase tax revenue by 7 million yuan per year. However, there are different opinions on various issues such as what standards to use to levy taxes on those with small capital. Therefore, it is expected that there will be some difficulties in the comprehensive reform of the tax rate system. All parties are extremely concerned about this matter.

Yu Qiaqing in Hong Kong, Forms Sanmin Company

After Yu Qiaqing traveled from Chongqing to various places for inspection and returned to Hong Kong, he raised huge amounts of capital and began to organize an enterprise organization called Sanmin Company to handle development and transportation businesses. Wang Xiaolai was also invited to serve as manager, and Wei Bozhen, Wu Zhihao, Jiang Weiyun, etc. assisted in the process. The scale is grand and far-reaching. Mr. Yu goes to the company to work every day, in high spirits, and is extremely optimistic about the future of the nation.

### Stabilization Fund Adopts Positive Measures, Stabilizing the Shanghai Exchange Market, Currently Investigating and Studying the Situation in Various Regions, British Representatives to Assist Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon

Minister Yi Wei and Wang Shijie announced to reporters in Chongqing on the 11th that the government is determined to stabilize the exchange market and will continue to supply the foreign exchange needed by Chinese and foreign merchants for legal trade. They also authorized the Stabilization Fund Committee to handle matters related to freezing. Since the issuance of the freezing order, the exchange market has seen import and export merchants scrambling to close deals, speculators competing to buy, and Japanese banks secretly covering short positions, causing the exchange rates for British and American currencies to plummet. The government urgently hopes that the Stabilization Fund can take positive and appropriate measures to stabilize the exchange market and consolidate the position of the legal tender.

On-the-Spot Investigation to Determine Measures

It is now known that the British and American members of the Stabilization Fund Committee have been extremely cautious since receiving the order and are making various plans. They have sent representatives to Chongqing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other places to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the foreign exchange situation and conduct a thorough study. Dr. Taylor, assistant to American member Fox, has come to Shanghai and is responsible for this mission. At the same time, Fox is currently consulting with the subcommittee on various countermeasures to stabilize the exchange market.

British Experts Will Also Arrive in Shanghai: According to yesterday's Times, the British side has also decided to send Sir Niemeyer, director of the Bank of England, to Shanghai to assist in the stabilization work. Niemeyer is a member of the Financial Committee of the League of Nations and is currently on his way to Shanghai. In the past few years, Niemeyer has been sent by the British government to the United States, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, India, and other countries as an economic representative. It is expected that Niemeyer's arrival will not only do his best to help stabilize the legal tender but also be responsible for establishing the future British economic policy in Shanghai.

### Rongwu Society, Lectures on Scriptures Today

It was previously announced that the lectures will be held at 3:00 PM (new clock time) or 老鐘, which is an traditional clock measuring method in the traditional style (old clock time), on the 4th floor of the China Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road. Listeners are welcome to arrive on time.

### American Missionary Murdered in Huai'an, American Consulate Receives Report

Female Missionary Wells Tragically Strangled, Several American Missionaries Missing in Qingjiangpu

The previous day, the English-language "China Press" reported that an American female missionary was strangled to death in Huai'an, and that four American missionaries were detained in Qingjiangpu. This news was translated and published in yesterday's newspaper. According to yesterday's "Continental News," the missionary was Ms. Wells. She was tragically strangled when the Japanese authorities seized the American Church Hospital and detained American personnel.

Retaliation Against the U.S. Freezing Measures This news was reported by Chinese people from Qingjiangpu to the American Presbyterian Church personnel in Shanghai. It stated that the Japanese took this action on July 31st to retaliate against the U.S. freezing Japanese assets. At that time, 40 Japanese military police entered the American Church Hospital, forcibly confined all foreigners in the hospital to one house. It is said that the American Consulate has received the report and inquired with the Japanese Consulate and military authorities. The Japanese side stated that they are still investigating and have no results yet. At the same time, Chinese people also reported that the Japanese army planned to close the hospital and expel the patients, but these rumors have not been confirmed. The American missionaries involved in this incident are Mr. and Mrs. Daleport, Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery, Mr. and Mrs. Vincent, Ms. Hall, and Ms. McCowan.

Many Missionaries Missing The "North-China Daily News" also reported that according to a group of missionaries who recently arrived in Shanghai, six to eight male and female missionaries and 250 patients from the American Church Hospital in Qingjiangpu have been expelled by the Japanese military police and their whereabouts are unknown. Yesterday, during a press conference hosted by the Japanese side, the Shanghai Japanese Army spokesman, Colonel Akiyama, was asked about this matter. Akiyama admitted that he had heard from "private sources" that "some unfortunate incident" had occurred, but stated that he had no definite information. Because the reported location of the incident is far from Shanghai, he may not receive news about it for some time. The Japanese authorities are currently doing their best to investigate the details.

2 Million Yuan Post Office Robbery Case, General Bureau Telegraphed Reply to Close the Case

The Shanghai Postal Administration's 2 million yuan remittance robbery case has been solved, and the stolen funds have been recovered, minimizing the loss. The entire process of the incident and the case being solved has been reported to the General Bureau by Mr. Jape Lin, the Shanghai Postal Director and Director of the Shanghai Office of the National Postal General Bureau. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the General Bureau is satisfied with the swift resolution of the case, so it will not investigate further. Post-incident matters have been ordered to be handled carefully by Postal Director Jape to conclude the case. It is now known that three old clerks and two bodyguards from the Savings and Remittance Bureau are still being held at the former Yong'an Silver Company site in Hongkou by the Japanese Military Police and are refusing to allow the Post Office to send personnel to visit them.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund, Survey of University and Middle School Students Completed, Preliminary Review Work in Progress, Names Will Be Announced Sequentially Due to the Large Number of Applicants

The primary school portion of this newspaper's readers' scholarship fund, after being reviewed early and announced in this newspaper on the 15th, has seen applicants eagerly coming to collect the funds in the past two days. Our colleagues at this newspaper have repeatedly instructed them to study hard so as not to betray the enthusiasm of all sectors of society in donating funds to support education. If their grades are excellent, they can continue to apply in the next term. Those who have not yet received the funds are requested to bring their seals and come to this newspaper with the applicant to collect the funds. As for the university and middle school portions, the survey and interview work has been completed. The preliminary review has been conducted in recent days, and it is scheduled to convene a committee meeting on the 19th to review and announce the results. Due to the large number of applicants, the results may be announced continuously over several days. Furthermore, applicants are anxious about the lack of tuition fees as the start of the school term approaches, and they have been sending letters asking whether their scholarship applications have been approved. This point cannot be answered before the public announcement. However, readers of this newspaper and colleagues at this newspaper who have enthusiastically donated funds will definitely not disappoint the applicant students with excellent grades and poor family backgrounds.

Movie Star Zhou Xuan Sympathizes with and Supports Education Ms. Zhou Xuan, a star of the Guohua Film Company, is dedicated to the film industry. She was deeply moved by Ms. Li Qinain's donation of a large sum of money. Yesterday, she also donated 100 yuan, demonstrating her courage to do good. The Jincheng and Jindu theaters also each contributed 100 yuan, and the Liangyou Photography and Printing Company also used its savings to contribute to the education fund. We would like to express our gratitude on behalf of the poor students. The list of donors to the education fund is as follows: Ms. Zhou Xuan, 100 yuan; Jincheng Theater, 100 yuan; Jindu Theater, 100 yuan; Mr. Wu Bingjing, 40 yuan; Little Sister Fan Yunfang, 40 yuan; all employees of Liangyou Photography and Printing Company, 33 yuan; Ms. Wu Yunwei, 20 yuan; Guitar, 20 yuan; Anonymous, 13 yuan and 1 jiao 6 fen; Dao Guang, 13 yuan; Yan Ji, 10 yuan; Mr. Gong Minghuo, 10 yuan; also, three primary school students saved their movie ticket money to donate, totaling: Zheng Mingcheng, 5 yuan; Zhu Daming, 2 yuan; Gu Xili, 2 yuan (totaling 9 yuan); Zhou Yuezhen, 1 yuan. The above totals 509 yuan and 1 jiao 6 fen. Previously, 51,110 yuan and 2 jiao 5 fen were saved, bringing the total to 51,619 yuan and 4 jiao 1 fen. (The 50 yuan donated by Zhang Xuren, the owner of Wenxinjv, Bu Buzu Zhai, Mr. Xu Naichi, and Mr. Zhang Dezhao, which was published in yesterday's donation list, is actually Mr. Lu Shenbao's birthday gift of 50 yuan, but the total was wrong, so this is clarified.)

Coal Briquettes, Price Controls Lifted

After checking the evidence submitted by various coal briquette factories, the French Concession authorities decided to lift the price controls on coal briquettes stipulated on August 9th of this year. However, in order to maintain market prices, they are studying methods to ensure that residents can purchase this daily necessity at a reasonable price. However, after hearing the news yesterday, residents throughout the city were quite uneasy, believing that the burden of living would inevitably become heavier. They earnestly hope that the authorities will withdraw the decision to abolish the coal briquette price assessment and continue to assess the coal briquette factory stock and the standard sales price for door-to-door sales. Otherwise, they will allow coal dealers to raise prices, which will not only make it impossible for ordinary people to live, but also make social order a major concern.

### Coolidge, Safe Voyage

No SOS Signal Sent

The President Coolidge of the American President Lines, which arrived in Shanghai on the 12th of this month from Manila and Hong Kong and has been anchored in the Huangpu River overnight, set sail for the U.S. on the morning of the 15th. The night before, news suddenly came from Manila that the ship had sent out a distress signal when it reached certain Japanese waters. When asked about this matter, a garbage collector from the American President Lines in Shanghai stated that the company had not received any distress messages regarding the ship. It is said that this news is absolutely false. The company is in constant communication with the Coolidge and there is no misfortune.

French Authorities Pay Attention to Price Trends

Since the land tax, house tax, and water fees, as well as the streetcar and public bus fares, have been increased one after another, prices have risen accordingly. In order to stabilize prices within the concession, the Price Stabilization Committee of the French Municipal Council has scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM tomorrow to discuss the prices of general goods within the concession. The most important items are rice, coal, oil, and fresh fish. However, regarding the price of rice, the committee assessed the price of No. 1 Saigon rice at 126 yuan per stone last week, but yesterday No. 1 Saigon rice was sold on the market for more than 130 yuan, a difference of more than 10 yuan. Coal briquettes were originally 16 yuan per dan, but are now selling for 16 yuan and 6 jiao. Soybean oil has increased to 2 yuan and 2 jiao per jin, and pork has risen to 4 yuan per jin. Although not uniform, such unrestrained price increases are enough to hinder the security of the concession, making it urgently necessary to properly plan a method to stop them. Currently, the French authorities have announced the abolition of coal briquette price controls, and soybean oil has also exceeded the price limit by more than 3 jiao per jin.

Is it Against the U.S. Oil Transport?

No Definite Indication of Interception According to the "North-China Daily News," the Japanese military spokesman stated at yesterday's (15th) press conference that the Japanese side is "quite concerned about the arrival of 90,000 barrels of oil being transported to Vladivostok on an American oil tanker." However, the spokesman refused to say whether the Japanese side would intercept the oil, only stating that the matter would depend on whether the goods could be classified as "war supplies" and that it would have to be decided by Tokyo. The local Japanese authorities have not received any notification about the steps the Japanese government will take regarding the oil being transported and general supplies in the future. However, he believes that no one can assert that the supplies being delivered to the Soviet Union will not be diverted south to Chongqing.

### The Confession of a Student Who Lost the Opportunity to Study: Another "Unrighteous Father"

In order to ensure the seriousness of the procedures for applying for scholarships, our colleagues have been diligently and enthusiastically engaged in investigating the family circumstances of various students. What our colleagues are being careful about is that we do not want to disappoint any student in urgent need of assistance, and at the same time, we do not want to waste a single penny of the money generously donated by readers who are enthusiastic about helping students.

The "Unsympathetic Brother" and "Unrighteous Father" mentioned in this newspaper's face-to-face interview records on the 11th have both received letters from readers. The letters sympathizing with the "Unsympathetic Brother" will not take up more space. Another reader, Mr. Mu, wrote a letter in which he advocated that the younger brother should embark on a productive path, or work-study. We are very moved and admire Mr. Mu's opinion. We believe that if an older brother has a monthly income of several hundred yuan, if he is sincerely loving to his younger brother, it seems that he should not be so poor that he cannot afford his younger brother's tuition fees of 60 or 70 yuan per semester. We understand the kindness of readers in donating money to support education. We definitely do not want the education of a younger brother with good grades and character to be interrupted halfway, so we must find a way to help him. At the same time, we also hope that parents and older brothers who are generally responsible for educating their children can be as responsible as possible, because there are many more lonely and helpless students in urgent need of assistance! We feel that it is right to prioritize what is urgent and then what is less urgent. We should sincerely hope and frankly request the parents and older brothers who are not absolutely unable to pay tuition fees. The "Unrighteous Father" section also received several letters from readers who mistakenly praised it. Among them, the letter from a woman who signed herself as a student who lost the opportunity to study was the most sympathetic and sincere. She and her sister are struggling in society, using their income to support their kind mother. Their father also abandoned his wife and made his two weak daughters lose the opportunity to study because of another love. We are very sympathetic to this fact after reading the woman's letter; however, simply blaming their father will not benefit the event itself. This kind of situation is a moral problem, a love problem, and a social problem. To reduce such unfortunate events, it is necessary for men and women to form a marriage seriously. After marriage, they must be based on mutual love, mutual assistance, and mutual understanding to form a complete family. We feel that the reality proves that such middle-of-the-road love, abandoning daughters and wives, is inhuman, destructive to the family, harmful to good customs, and weakens social health, and will be condemned by personal conscience and severely judged by morality, except for the fact that it is not allowed by law. Einstein said in his autobiography that people accept the inherent virtues in society as naturally as they accept air. We publish this woman's letter in the hope that people who are on or wandering on this thorny path will be vigilant! Realize! Repent! Stop immediately, turn around, accept the inherent virtues, and breathe the natural air.

The following is the original letter from the student who lost the opportunity to study.

Dear Editor:

I am not a person applying for a scholarship, but I sympathize with a person applying for a scholarship. When I saw the family situation of a female scholarship applicant published on page 7 of your newspaper on the 11th, I couldn't help but be reminded of my old wounds and burst into tears! Ten years ago, my father was doing business in Shanghai. Although life was not top-notch, it was still an upper-middle-class family. A loving father and mother, who wouldn't envy these four big "real" girls. Good times don't last, "I only see the new people smile, but I don't see the old people cry." These two sentences actually occurred in this happy family.

This is a story of repaying kindness with revenge: My father's lover, who is also the protagonist of repaying kindness with revenge, is the daughter of my mother's friend. Because she was poor, she asked my mother for help, asking her to introduce her to a job. My mother was a kind and weak person, so she immediately made her my family's teacher. This just fell into the other person's trick, so the transformation of the family and the tragedy began.

At first, my father paid the living expenses on time. If he was a little unhappy, he would vent his anger on us, scolding us lightly and punishing us severely, without any love for his own flesh and blood. At that time, I was only ten years old, and my sister was only eight years old, and I had already tasted the pain of losing the opportunity to study. After the January 28th Incident, although I was given the opportunity to study for a year, it was "ten cold and one warm," which not only did not improve, but also increased the pain of awareness.

(Fortunately, there were onlookers who were indignant and pitied our situation, and helped my sister and me to go to school, but due to the changes in the situation, we only completed a primary school golden period, and that was how it passed.) My mother became a useless person who had food but no work. Because my father's economy was sufficient, his temperament also changed with his wealth. He had forgotten what a husband and wife are, what flesh and blood are, and what the five human relationships are. He began to scold my mother, and even when my eldest sister got married, he didn't give a penny, didn't ask, and enjoyed the peace, My mother was a person who was influenced by the old ethics, so she could only endure and seek survival, thinking that human nature would not die for long, and there would be a day of reflection, but who knew that all the endurance could not make the ungrateful person feel ashamed and reflect!

Before the August 13th Incident, the whole family returned to Guangdong. At that time, my father had already had the heart to abandon us. He had tried to escape once but failed. Until one day last year, he actually performed a live drama of expelling his wife and abandoning his children. At that time, my mother had no choice but to ask for litigation, but my father relied on his money and power to avoid seeing her; the inquiries published in the newspaper were unanswered, and now we are separated invisibly. My sisters have worked hard to take on the heavy responsibilities of the family to comfort our mother, who has suffered so much. I am a person who was abandoned by my father and has suffered the pain of being stimulated by this family and losing the opportunity to study, so I deeply sympathize with this scholarship applicant. Because I believe that a person who has suffered pain and stimulation will definitely cherish herself, work hard to improve, and develop her new life. Finally, I hope that if this woman gets the opportunity, she will work hard to move forward in the future and develop for society to comfort her abandoned mother, and don't be influenced by heredity to be an irresponsible person.

With the most sincere and frank attitude, I say a word. I know that you are a person who is enthusiastic about society. I hope to borrow your great pen (because my pen is really too clumsy) to remind some people who only know about lust and forget about their wives and children not to only know how to enjoy themselves and ignore the suffering of others, forget their responsibilities, and bury the great youth of the country. Because I don't know how many people are suffering from this pain!

The writing is not fluent, and the words are not smooth. I have spent your precious time. I am sorry and happy. I hope you will forgive me. With An, Sincerely, A Student Who Lost the Opportunity to Study, August 12th

### Zheng Zuyin, Manager of Hancheng Foreign Firm, Kidnapped Yesterday, Four Kidnappers Ambushed at the Alley Entrance, Forcibly Taken into a Car and Kidnapped Without a Trace

Hancheng Foreign Firm at 115 Yuanyuan Road, Public Concession, was opened by Zheng Zhonghan from Zhenhai. After Zheng passed away two years ago, he left behind nine sons and five daughters. The eldest son, Zheng Zuyin, succeeded as the manager. Zheng is currently 26 years old and studied at Fudan University. This spring, he married his fellow villager, Huang Aiying, and lived with her at 11 Fulu Village, Lane 384, Fulvli Road, French Concession. After his father passed away due to illness in 1939, Zuyin immediately left school to succeed his father, equipped with car number 6125, acting as his own driver, leaving early and returning late, which had become a habit. Yesterday morning, around 9:00, Zuyin, as usual, had breakfast, wearing a light gray suit, and went out with his wife and younger brother Zuxiang (a student at the attached middle school of Fudan University). They boarded the car, but as soon as the car drove out of the alley entrance, four bandits suddenly jumped out of the roadside, three wearing Western suits and one wearing short shirt and pants. Two bandits drew out pistols, intercepted Zheng's car, and threatened them. They first expelled Zheng Zuyin's wife and brother from the car and sent someone to monitor them. Then Zuyin was dragged out of the car and helped into a black-plated car number 8794 parked by the roadside. A bandit driver sped off towards Terrace Road. Afterwards, Zheng's brother Zuxiang reported the situation to the French police station and requested an investigation. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate the scene. They are currently ordering the tracking of the bandits.

### The Gun Murder of Special Police and the Sending of Bombs Are Related

The English-language "China Press" reported yesterday (15th) that

Yesterday afternoon, near the railway crossing at Bailinan Road, a special police officer in western Shanghai saw two pedestrians carrying two bamboo baskets and tried to inspect them, but was suddenly shot and killed by the two men who drew out pistols. Also, at 3:00 PM yesterday, at the residence of Wu Bosheng, the business manager of the Xinyu Yarn Factory, at 80 Wanyi Lane, Luban Road, two people suddenly claimed to be delivering gifts, bringing two baskets of fruit containing two hand grenades. According to the police, the two cases are closely related, because the people who sent the hand grenades to intimidate were probably the two thugs who shot and killed the special police officer. The body of the special police officer was found in a certain creek near Bailinan Road, and his rifle was also recovered. However, several rounds of ammunition are missing.

When Wang's rickshaw puller, Qu Hanbang, saw his master being shot, he cried out in shock. The shooter did not dare to stay long and fled with his gun without a trace. Afterwards, Wang hurriedly ordered Qu to drive to Shizelong Hospital for treatment, so the police station did not receive a report at the time. Later, the hospital reported the incident and is currently investigating the case. It is said that Wang's injuries are not serious.

### Contentment and Patience

— Hu Ying

"Contentment brings constant joy, and patience brings peace." This is a very standard couplet for doorways, and we can see it on people's doors. The meaning of this saying is that as long as a person can be content and patient, they can enjoy a happy and comfortable life.

I often see some people whose families are already well-off, but because they are not content and admire the extravagant and romantic life, they use all their property for speculation, hoping for a lucky success. However, the reality is often the opposite of the ideal. Not only do they fail to achieve their goals, but they also end up ruined and disgraced, regretting it too late! Isn't this the harm of not being content? There are also some people who are hot-tempered, and when they encounter something unsatisfactory, they slam the table and roar like thunder! They have no patience at all, and this is of course also a failure. As the old saying goes, "A little impatience spoils great plans." Such a fiery temper will certainly affect their future!

At present, how expensive are prices? It is not easy for a father to maintain the household expenses. We should be content with clothing, food, etc., and only seek to be warm and full. However, we cannot be content in seeking knowledge. We should make progress inch by inch and have endless desires in order to achieve success. We must not be complacent with a little gain and think that our knowledge is already vast. We must know that knowledge is a bottomless ocean, and what you have learned is just a drop in the bucket!

One more thing we should remember is that patience has limits! If someone punches you or kicks you, you may as well be patient for a while and not argue with them. If someone wants to ruin your reputation, you should use all your strength, embrace the spirit of fearlessness, and stand up and fight them until you win! This is true for individuals, and of course, it is also true for countries!

In short, contentment and patience are both inherent virtues of our country. Except for the pursuit of learning and in cases of extreme necessity, we should adhere to them unswervingly.

### "Driving in Reverse" and "Jumping the Ditch"

— Shang Heng

What does the phrase "driving in reverse" mean? I think children all know it. A car that does not move forward but backward; this is called "driving in reverse." For example, a student who was in the fourth grade of elementary school last year has regressed to the third grade this year; next year he still wants to regress to the second grade; we would say that this student is "driving in reverse."

"Jumping the ditch," then, how do you explain that? A person riding a horse, seeing a ditch across in front of him, disregards everything and spurs the horse to jump over; this is called "jumping the ditch." For example, a student who was in the third grade of elementary school last year suddenly jumps to the first grade of upper elementary school this year; next year he still wants to take the junior high school exam, we would say that this student is "jumping the ditch."

"Driving in reverse" is regression, and we should strongly oppose it. I believe that a person or student who is "driving in reverse" will definitely fail and be eliminated in society in the future because only those who adapt to the trend of the times have a place to stand in a competitive world?

"Driving in reverse" is certainly regression, but "jumping the ditch" is also very dangerous. One careless step, and you will fall into the ditch.

Children, now there are three paths for you to take. Please use extremely sharp eyes and extremely correct thinking to choose the path you want to take. The three paths are: one is the path of "driving in reverse," one is the path of "jumping the ditch," and the other is the path of "walking on solid ground."

As I see it, the top two paths are not good. The third path is the most stable, which is the path of "walking on solid ground."

### Does the Sea Have a Bottom?

— Zhang Xianjin

One morning, Hai'er and his younger brother Min'er were sitting together by the pond in the courtyard, watching the green water rippling with shallow waves, while chatting.

As they chatted, they suddenly talked about the question of the sea. Min'er said with certainty, "Brother! I believe the sea definitely has no bottom." The brother corrected, "No, the sea has a bottom." Min'er disagreed again, "Brother, if you don't believe it, we can go to the seaside right now to explore it." The brother explained, "Min'er, when we go to the beach to explore, because the water is too deep and very dirty, we can't see the bottom of the sea." Min'er still disagreed, "No, my textbook also tells me that the sea has no bottom."

The two argued with each other, neither willing to give up. As a result, Hai'er came up with a good idea.

Hai'er said, "It's no use arguing like this. Why don't we ask Dad?" Min'er listened and confidently followed his brother to ask their father.

They found their father, and Min'er asked first, "Dad, does the sea have a bottom?" Hai'er was about to argue, but Dad had already spoken. Dad said fairly, "Min'er, the sea does have a bottom. This has been proven by many scientists. For example, the deepest part of the Atlantic Ocean is 45,000 feet deep." Min'er listened to this and had to go back to the courtyard to play, his face red with embarrassment.

### Interesting Egg Problem

— Wang Ya Xian

This day, it was raining, and playful Min'er couldn't go outside to play, and he was feeling bored at home. His brother Cong'er said to him, "I have an interesting problem, can you answer it?" Min'er said, "Okay, tell me, what kind of problem is it?"

Cong'er said, "An egg seller took eggs to the market to sell. His first customer bought half of all his eggs, plus half an egg! His second customer also bought half of the remaining eggs, plus half an egg. His third customer bought half of the remaining eggs in the same way, plus half an egg. In this way, his eggs were just sold out, but he didn't break a single egg. Think about it, how many eggs did he have in total?" Min'er found the problem very interesting, but after thinking for a while, he couldn't figure it out. He went to ask his brother how many eggs the person had in total. His brother Cong'er said, "That person had a total of seven eggs. The first person bought half of them, which is three and a half, plus another half an egg, isn't that four eggs in total? Then he had three eggs left. The second person bought half of the remaining eggs, which is one and a half, plus another half an egg, which is two eggs in total. Then there was only one egg left. The third person bought half of the remaining egg, which is half an egg, plus half an egg, isn't that exactly one egg for him to buy? In this way, the egg seller sold all his eggs without breaking a single egg." Min'er listened to his brother's explanation and suddenly understood, nodding repeatedly. At this time, the sky had cleared, and he ran outside to ask his friends about this interesting egg problem. (Reward for assisting the scholarship)

### Harming Others Harms Oneself

— Xun

Once upon a time, there was a rat living on land who, unfortunately, became close friends with a frog who lived mostly in the water.

One day, the frog had bad intentions and tied the rat's feet tightly to his own feet. The two animals were linked together. The frog first led his rat friend to the meadow where they usually looked for food. After that, he led the rat to the edge of the pond where he lived. Until later, the frog suddenly jumped into the pond, dragging the rat down with him. The frog was very happy in the water, swimming back and forth, croaking as if he had won a great victory.

The unfortunate rat soon drowned in the water. His body was still tied to the frog's feet, floating on the surface of the water. An eagle saw it from the air and suddenly flew down, grabbing him with its claws and taking him into the air.

The frog, because he was still tightly tied to the rat's legs, was also taken away by the eagle and became a snack.

Children! After reading this story, do you think harming others is beneficial?

### Homemade Popsicles

— Bi Gen

Children! In this hot summer, don't you want to eat some cold drinks to cool down? But what is sold in the market is often not very hygienic. I will tell you a kind of homemade popsicle. The method is very simple and quite interesting:

Prepare: Ice. Calcium chloride (sold in chemical industrial raw material stores, about seven or eight cents a pound, can be used in three times). Fruit syrup or cooked red beans. Several lead-skin popsicle molds, wooden box.

Method: Crush the ice into small pieces, put it in a wooden box, and mix with calcium chloride. Mix the fruit syrup with cold boiled water, put it in the mold, and insert a small stick. Insert it between the ice cubes in the wooden box. At this time, the ice and calcium chloride undergo a chemical reaction, which can lower the temperature in the box to about minus 50 degrees Celsius, and the fruit syrup will condense into a popsicle shape. Take the mold out of the box and soak it in cold water, and the popsicle can be taken out and eaten. If you want to continue, you can make it in the same way. The ice cubes in the box, etc., are still effective. In this way, you can make a lot of popsicles, and the whole family can eat them. And the popsicles made in this way are very hygienic because bacteria cannot survive at minus 50 degrees. Moreover, things you make yourself are more delicious than ready-made ones on the market!

Superstition

### Shanghai Municipal Council Lagner Elementary School

— Zhao Demao

Superstition is a bad habit of people, especially in China. Almost one-third of the 365 days of the year are spent worshiping Buddha, gods, and ancestors.

Today, I accidentally flipped through last year's diary and made a statistic, which made me discover a surprising result - I made 33 offerings of food in half a year (that is, worshiping ancestors, averaging almost once a week. If each time costs 20 yuan, then wouldn't it cost 1,000 yuan?

If every household could save this amount of money, then little by little, grain by grain, wouldn't the money saved nationwide be used to protect the country and defend the people? Then I dare say that we would never have to live this painful life here.

However, I see that there are still many small roads where Taiping Gong Jiao (a Taoist ritual) are being held. Not only do they not "contribute money or effort," but they are actually doing things that are both expensive and laborious. This is really a painful and foolish act! Moreover, the Flame Mouth (a Buddhist ritual) is often performed until late at night, and people often catch colds because of this. If they eat this Flame food full of dust and bacteria, then the epidemic will inevitably break out, causing vomiting, diarrhea, and even death.

Children, can you tell me? What kind of peace is this supposed to protect?!

### Asking About Flowers

— Lin Ren

Although it is a small garden the size of a dried tofu, A Liang's father can still plant some flowers and plants. The walls facing west are covered with green morning glories, the wooden fences on the east side are covered with the large green leaves of loofah gourds, and two or three ropes are pulled down from the upstairs to guide the loofah gourds and morning glories to climb up. In addition, there is enough space to plant some low shrubs and more than a dozen pots of herbaceous flowers. In the summer, it is full of greenery and pleasing to the eye. Even in A Liang's mind, it feels quite lovely, so A Liang is often with them, as if he has made very close friends. He also knows a lot about his friends - flowers and trees - everything.

One day, his father was tidying up: removing the weeds from the flower pots, loosening the soil, and lining up the flower pots. Unintentionally, he saw a hole under each flower pot. "This is of course because I'm afraid there is too much water in the flower pot, so there must be a hole to release the excess water, but why can't there be too much water in the flower pot?" He thought to himself, but suddenly he couldn't figure out the reason, so he told his father about it.

"This is indeed difficult to answer. You must know that the roots of the flowers and plants in the flower pot also have life. They also need to breathe, just like us. Therefore, the soil in the flower pot should allow air to enter. If the water in the flower pot stays in the pot because the roots don't have time to absorb it all, and there is too much excess water, then the pot will be completely occupied by water, all the gaps are filled with water, the soil is all water, and there is no room for air to exist. Therefore, the roots of the flowers and plants cannot breathe and are suffocated to death, just like people are suffocated to death by water. Finally, the roots will gradually rot, and the flower or plant will die. So there should be a hole at the bottom of the flower pot to release excess water, and on the one hand, to allow air to come and go freely. The reason we fill the flower pot high is the same."

"Dad, look at these flowers and trees, they are all green leaves, and there are very few flowers. What are so many leaves for?"

"Leaves are the most important thing for flowers and trees. If there are no leaves, there are no flowers and trees. The reason why flowers and trees can bloom and bear fruit is that they need sunlight and the carbon dioxide we exhale, plus the water absorbed by the roots in the soil, to be transported to the leaves. You must know that there is chlorophyll in the leaves. The reason why leaves appear green is all thanks to it. When sunlight shines on the leaves, chlorophyll begins to work, converting the carbon dioxide and water absorbed by the leaves into food for flowers and trees. Therefore, chlorophyll is like a machine, sunlight is the coal burned, carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials, and the food made for flowers and trees is their output. Moreover, the food for flowers and trees is also our food. Otherwise, why do I eat vegetables? Because vegetables are full of ready-made food. Flowers and trees eat the food they make themselves to grow, so the more leaves there are, the more food is made, and the faster the flowers and trees grow."

Later, his father picked some flowers for the vase and placed them on the desk, which made the whole room look much better. But by the evening, some of the flowers had withered, and some of the flowers had closed without opening. "What is the reason for this?" A Liang asked his father again.

"This is because the air in the room easily dries out the petals, and the water absorbed by the flower stem in the vase still doesn't have time to moisturize the petals, so the flowers that are picked down wither after being displayed for a short time. The flowers that are closed and not open may bloom again tomorrow, because when it gets to night, the temperature drops, but the flowers need a certain temperature to bloom. When it gets to night, there is of course no sunlight, and the flowers are not willing to bloom either."

Entertainment Industry

### Hollywood "Arsenal"

— Xin Fang

Recently, in order to cope with the tense world situation and to prevent the outbreak of war, the United States has spared no effort in expanding its armaments. All institutions, whether run by the state or private individuals, that manufacture military equipment are now requisitioned by the government and are working hard to produce. Since then, it has had little impact on the various classes of society, but the most affected is Hollywood. Before explaining the reason, I would like to ask the reader to close their eyes and recall.

Don't we often see scenes of war on the screen? Guns, cannons, tanks, even airplanes, are they not all equipped, and are they not all realistic? But Hollywood is not an arsenal, so where do these military equipment come from? Originally, they were rented from military equipment manufacturing institutions in the country; now, because the government restricts their supply to private use, wouldn't Hollywood film merchants have great difficulties if they wanted to create war scenes again?

In order to remedy this, the clever film merchants have really prepared to set up an "arsenal" themselves, but the "military equipment" they manufacture can only be said to be imitations. This kind of imitation industry was already very common in Hollywood before the restrictions were imposed, and it is now even more developed. In the past, they could only imitate light military equipment, but now they have progressed to being able to imitate airplanes, and the products of the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation are the most famous and have a very impressive output. Currently, the company is imitating a German Messerschmitt-type aircraft, preparing to use it in a new film: in the near future, we will be able to see aircraft on the screen that are similar to the real thing but not the real thing? Finally, I can tell the reader that the so-called "steel-bone buildings" and "armored ships" in the films are actually made of wood, but after a coat of paint, they can deceive our eyes; the tricks of Hollywood film merchants are really ever-changing!

### Chrysanthemum Kingdom Chronicles

— Xiao Xian

(2) Teacher and Student Turn Against Each Other, Head of the Teachings Beaten

Shang Laodao (He Yu), who sings martial arts roles, has a unique masterpiece called "Battle of Chuzhou." This play is about the story of the teacher and student of the Yuan Dynasty Marshal Tuotuo turning against each other. Now, a real news story about a teacher and student turning against each other has happened in the northern pear garden. The protagonists are the Tongtian Sect Master Wang Yaoqing, mentioned above, and his beloved disciple, "Senior Brother Cheng Yuqing," who is very powerful in Gu Xuanxuan. Moreover, Yuqing, after turning against his teacher, even beat his teacher and injured him. Some people may not believe this when it is said, but listen to me slowly:

On the evening of the 31st of last month, Wang's residence at No. 7 Dama Temple was full of distinguished guests (as usual, Yao's family only has a market after dinner, and friends and disciples go to his house in the middle of the night). This "Senior Brother" Cheng Yuqing, the boss, walked into the house swaying from side to side. People in the house knew at a glance that "Senior Brother" had drunk a few more glasses today, because this was a very common thing, so everyone didn't care. Unexpectedly, after Yuqing entered the house, he said to Wang: "Are you going to agree to that matter or not?" At that time, Yaoqing seemed to know that Yuqing was a little drunk, and in order to avoid talking too much, he said to him: "I agree!" Yuqing said again: "It's not enough to just agree, you have to say you definitely agree." After Yuqing finished speaking, Yaoqing's face showed displeasure, and the two sides said more and more outrageous things, one sentence after another. Yuqing then said to himself: "I, his mother, have reason but also no reason, you, his mother, have no reason but also have reason!" When Yaoqing heard Yuqing start scolding, in front of everyone, wouldn't he lose the dignity of a teacher? So he said sternly to Yuqing: "If you say 'his mother' again, I will beat you." (Beating means hitting) Yaoqing's words were intended to intimidate, not to really hit him. Unexpectedly, before the words were out of his mouth, Yuqing immediately punched Wang's face, and spoke as he moved. "You hit me, I hit you!" (The teacher said it as a joke, but the disciple really hit.) Seeing the situation, Yaoqing immediately got up from the opium couch to dodge. Although he didn't touch his face, his left arm had been scratched by Yuqing, and blood was flowing non-stop. At that time, Yaoqing was about to hit Yuqing back, but another disciple of his, Zhang Xiaoshan, a famous ticket holder from the north, actually held his teacher down, although he was persuading him, he did not want Yaoqing to hit Yuqing. At this time, Yang Baozhong (Yaoqing's nephew) and Du Haiquan (Wang Yurong's manager) persuaded Yuqing out. Yuqing scolded as he walked, and continued to roar at the door. Yang and Du embraced Yuqing and took him to Zhang Meiyun's house, another female disciple of Wang's who lived across the street from Wang's house. This new play of teacher and student turning against each other ended here. As for why Yuqing wanted to hit Yaoqing, and what exactly was the matter that Yuqing asked Yaoqing about? Listen to the next episode.

Yuan Yuan hurriedly said to the lyricist, "The old man is here again, how annoying! I know he must have bad intentions towards me. Please avoid him for the time being! To avoid meeting each other inconvenient, I have to wrong you," the lyricist said, "I don't have to hide, I'll go home now. After I go back, I'll prepare everything and be sure to prepare a boat to pick you up tomorrow to go together. As for where to go, we'll discuss it in detail tomorrow night." As the lyricist said this, there was already a sound of people downstairs, and he immediately said goodbye to Yuan Yuan and went downstairs. After Xi Yu Lyricist left, Tian Hongyu had already gone upstairs. He only brought two or three attendants today, and Hua Butterfly did not come with him. Yuan Yuan felt a little more at ease, and then cheered up to receive him. Tian Hongyu sent some pearl jewelry and said to her with a smile, "I didn't have anything to give you yesterday, now I only brought some pearls, if you like them, take them. I love you for being exceptionally intelligent. If you like to travel to Yanjing, I'll take you with me, because I'll be returning north soon." Yuan Yuan listened to his words, her heart pounding, and she had to thank him on her face, and said that her body was not very strong now, and the road to Yanjing was long and far away, and she was afraid that her weak body could not bear the burden of the journey, and she would wait for another day, if there was a chance, she would definitely go to serve him. Tian Hongyu laughed and said, "If I pick you up to go together, someone will take care of you along the way, and I will definitely not make you tired, so why do you have to wait for another day? There are twelve golden hairpins in the old man's mansion; women's music is in line, comparable to Niu Sengru in those years, it's a pity that there is still a lack of a female secretary, a fairy genius like you, a talented woman like Sima Xiangru, is really rare! If you are willing to go with the old man, you will definitely be the best in the group, and the old man will not fail you, I don't know what your beauty's heart is like? Do you dislike me for being old?" After saying this, he laughed again. Yuan Yuan listened to Tian Hongyu's words and his laughter, and was very scared in her heart. She thought to herself, I only need to perfunctorily get you through this, and tomorrow night, I and the lyricist will leave quietly, and fly away into the darkness, no matter how much wealth and power you have, you can't do anything to me.
