### Political Advisor Lattimore Appointed; Sino-American Cooperation Becomes More Complete; Air Force Formed by American Aircraft to Appear; Major Change in China's War Situation Within Six Months

Chongqing, 28th (United Press) - Today, it was officially announced that Lattimore, who has resided in China for a long time and is recognized as an expert on Pacific affairs, has been hired by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as an advisor for a term of six months. Chairman Chiang's appointment of Lattimore was recommended by President Roosevelt. It is reported that Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, who is currently in the United States, sent a telegram from President Roosevelt to China on June 23rd, stating that China's appointment of Lattimore as an advisor would be viewed in Washington as a major indication of increased understanding between China and the United States. The news of Lattimore's appointment has been well received here, as Lattimore's books and papers on Pacific issues are well-known and highly respected. Many Chinese officials here are also acquainted with Lattimore. Those who know Lattimore claim that he is well-versed in Pacific and world issues, making him highly suitable for this position. Lattimore is currently the Dean of the School of International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and also serves as the editor of the Pacific Affairs magazine published by the Pacific Council. His parents are American and he was born in Washington. He studied in England, America, and China. Lattimore can speak Chinese and Mongolian and can read Chinese, Mongolian, and Russian. Lattimore has spent most of his life in China and has traveled extensively throughout Mongolia. He is also recognized as an expert on Mongolian issues. He left China in 1936, after residing in Beiping that year, and then assumed his current position. He has spent most of his time in China engaged in academic work and investigating situations on behalf of the Pacific Council, but for a period of time, he worked as a reporter for the Times in Beiping and Tianjin. He has authored many books on China.

Washington, 28th - President Roosevelt has recommended Lattimore to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as his personal political advisor. Mr. Lattimore will soon leave the United States for China. Since 1938, he has served as a trustee of the Walter Hines Page School of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University, and since 1934, he has served as the editor of the Pacific Affairs Quarterly. He has never held a government position. His reputation as a political commentator stems from his long-term residence in China, extensive travel, deep understanding of the lives of the Chinese people, and sympathy for their aspirations. Mr. Lattimore is also an authoritative international commentator on Manchurian and Mongolian issues. He has offered profound criticisms of China's four years of resistance against Japan, believing that China is a major supporter of democratic politics, as China must not only build a new and independent democratic politics like other countries but also fight a desperate battle. Washington observers believe that Lattimore's appointment is a major manifestation of increasingly complete cooperation between China and the United States.

Washington, 28th (Reuters) - American aid to China is now gradually taking concrete form. According to reliable sources, one step in this regard will be the appointment of an American political advisor to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for consultation. His name has not yet been announced, but it is said that Lattimore will be given this appointment, as Lattimore is familiar with Far Eastern affairs, especially China and its borders. Lattimore is currently the head of a school in Washington. It is expected that the official appointment will be announced within a few days. The specific duties of the political advisor are not yet known, but it is generally believed that this appointment did not originate from the State Department but from the White House and is related to the aid-to-China organization established after Currie's visit to Chongqing for investigation. Currie is a White House aide currently in charge of aid to China. This matter, as well as the continued shipment of American aircraft and the dispatch of volunteer pilots and instructors to China, all demonstrate the baselessness of recent rumors that the United States intends to change its Far Eastern policy. A commentator for the Washington Post said that the time for further discussion of reaching a compromise with Japan has not yet come and is not generally accepted. Undoubtedly, Japan must first greatly change its policy before the United States can consider making changes. As of today, Tokyo shows no signs of making the necessary changes. According to well-informed sources, aid to China will definitely be expanded in the coming months. Within six months, China's war situation will be greatly changed, as it is generally believed that China will then be able to obtain an air force formed by American aircraft, which is far superior to what Japan is currently using in China. Therefore, at that time, the entire situation will not be one of Japan coveting Siberia or advancing south into the Dutch East Indies, but whether Japan can still maintain its current occupation of various parts of China.

### Washington Observers See Japan's Position Worsening

Observers here believe that Japan is bewildered and confused by Hitler's sudden change in his relations with the Soviet Union and does not understand its intentions. People here found Tokyo's statement yesterday warning the United States not to ship supplies to Vladivostok to aid the Soviet Union quite interesting and are studying its implications. Some Far East experts believe that this is a threat to the United States, while others believe that it is an appeal to the United States, hoping that the United States will not add another complex and difficult problem to Japan, forcing Japan to make a decision that it already considers difficult. If the Soviet Union can resist Germany, then American aid through Vladivostok will likely cause Berlin to exert pressure on Japan, forcing Japan to either join the war or refuse to support its Axis allies. However, joining the war would not only mean directly fighting the Soviet Union but also clashing with Britain and the United States, while refusing to join the war would leave Japan politically and militarily isolated. At the same time, Japan has ultimately failed to extricate itself from the quagmire it is deeply mired in in China, as time has shown that Japan is powerless to end its war against China. Japan's position, as viewed from here, is deteriorating daily. Therefore, it is expected that it will not launch any aggressive actions for some time but will only quietly express its views while assessing the situation and harboring the futile hope that international events will take a turn favorable to Japan.

### United States Transfers Transport Aircraft to Britain

New York, 28th (Reuters) - Mr. Graham, Chairman of the American Aircraft Transport Association, held a private meeting with leaders of American airlines on Thursday and stated that twelve transport aircraft must be handed over to Britain within the next four weeks, and another twelve aircraft must be handed over on August 1st. It has been determined that American domestic airlines have already transferred 22% of their aircraft to Britain. The sixteen major airlines currently have a total of 358 aircraft. Britain has now obtained 103 aerial transport aircraft from the United States.

### 100,000 Chinese Youths Send Letter Thanking the United States for Aid

Washington, 28th (United Press) - Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, yesterday presented Under Secretary of State Welles with a letter signed by 100,000 Chinese youths expressing gratitude for American aid to China. The letter will be forwarded to President Roosevelt on Sunday, at which time the President will present it to the new library at Hyde Park. Former Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Shi Zhaoji accompanied Dr. Hu Shih to Welles' office. The letter was enclosed in a beautiful Chinese silk case. The letter stated, "We hereby express our heartfelt gratitude to Your Excellency and the people of Your Excellency's country for the economic and material assistance you have given to our people."

### Japanese Residents in the Dutch East Indies Begin to Evacuate

### Japanese Seize Goods in Hanoi

Hanoi, 28th (United Press) - According to reliable sources, the Japanese authorities here yesterday seized goods stored in warehouses here before the Thai-Vietnamese War. This action is no different from the Japanese seizure of American goods in warehouses in Haiphong last month.

### Japanese Purchase Rubber in Thailand

Bangkok, 18th (Reuters) - Thai newspapers today reported on the Japanese purchase of rubber and tin in Thailand, stating that there are currently at least ten representatives of Japanese rubber companies who are heavily purchasing Thai rubber and rubber plantations. Since May 1st, the Japanese have purchased no fewer than ten rubber plantations. As of the end of May, Japanese ships had transported a total of 200,000 tons of rubber. It is reported that Japanese ships refuse to transport rubber that does not belong to the Japanese Rubber Association out of the country. Tin from some areas of Thailand has traditionally been transported in large quantities to Malaya, but mine owners now plan to transport their tin to Bangkok, as the price in Bangkok is higher than in Malaya.

### U.S. Senate Passes Huge Army Budget; Total Exceeds Ten Billion Dollars; Specified Large Sum for Purchase of 13,000 Aircraft

### U.S. Government Management of Merchant Ships Unanimously Approved by State Chamber of Commerce

Washington, 28th (Reuters) - The State Chamber of Commerce yesterday unanimously approved a bill allowing the government to manage American merchant ships for national defense purposes.

The bill authorizes the Maritime Commission to issue permits to ships registered in the United States and ships owned by American citizens. Foreign shipowners who wish to be included may also be issued permits. The bill stipulates that only ships holding permits will be entitled to priority in loading, repairs, and other facilities in various ports. The Committee also has the power to dispose of the destination and freight rates of goods. Anyone who does not comply with the Committee's orders may be fined US$5,000 and imprisoned for up to two years.

Editorial

### What is Japan Waiting For?

The German-Soviet war has been going on for a week. Countries, whether neutral or non-neutral, have almost all expressed their positions. Even small countries like Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, on the Axis side, have either broken off diplomatic relations or joined the war. Only Japan, which first signed an alliance with Germany and Italy, is still hesitant and carefully observing the situation in meetings. This is truly a spectacle in modern diplomatic history. No wonder the world wants to ask: What exactly is Japan waiting for?

Imagining the current Tokyo government's situation, it is indeed in a difficult position, unable to make a decisive decision. Declaring neutrality seems too unfair to the Allied countries. Invoking the alliance would violate the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, which was achieved with great difficulty, and would also be equivalent to officially joining the German-Italian front and independently confronting China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Far East! This dilemma, although a natural result of Matsuoka's multifaceted diplomacy, is definitely not something that Matsuoka can undo and remedy today. In this awkward situation, it is natural to remain silent for the time being. This silence, even if it is glorified as carefully observing the situation, in reality, on the one hand, indicates that a heated debate between pro-German and non-pro-German factions is raging within Japan, and on the other hand, exposes that the Konoe government still needs to observe the evolution of the European war situation in the future before it can judge which side it is most advantageous to join. Japan's state of indecision is certainly due to the fact that it has been using troops in China for four years and its strength has been depleted by more than half, so it must be cautious about everything. However, there is another major factor that the Konoe generation must consider, and that is whether it is in Japan's best interest to promote the formal merger of the European and Asian wars?

From the outbreak of the European war the year before last until Germany attacked the Soviet Union last week, the Soviet Union was the only "fence-sitter" among the major countries in the world. It clearly implemented completely different and even contradictory policies for the European and Asian wars: in Europe, it was close to Germany, indirectly fueling the flames of aggression; in the Far East, it directly aided anti-aggression China to strike Japan. This was a contradiction in the Soviet Union itself. From a global perspective, it was also a major obstacle to the establishment of a firm democratic front. The European and Asian wars could have merged long ago, but due to the influence of the Soviet Union's dual diplomacy, the international situation has never been thoroughly clarified in the past two years. Now that the Soviet Union is on the same front as China and Britain, if Japan's "expression of attitude" is the result of deciding to invoke the Tripartite Pact and assist the Axis powers in combat, then whether it advances south, north, or even west, the current European and Asian wars will immediately merge into a whole world war; because at that time, Japan will formally assist the Axis, and Britain and the Soviet Union will naturally have no reason to maintain neutrality towards Japan. In this division, the democratic countries' lineup is clearly "stronger" than the aggressor countries. If there are no new factors, it is expected that Japan may not be willing to immediately "throw itself into the trap." The reason why it is still observing and considering today is probably for this reason. In other words, Japan must at least wait for the German-Soviet war to be decided, convincing itself that the Soviet Union is no longer to be feared, and further convincing itself that the strength of the democratic front has been relatively diminished, before it dares to express its attitude. Before that, even if there is any expression, it may have to be made with extreme reservation and extreme ambiguity. However, if Germany's attack on the Soviet Union is extraordinarily successful and Hitler truly defeats the Soviet Union in a short period of time, then Japan will definitely believe that its golden opportunity has arrived. It will probably volunteer to fulfill the alliance without Hitler's urging.

In summary, it can be seen that the future outcome of the German-Soviet war will not only determine Japan's future position but also affect the trend of the entire situation, because whether the two wars in the East and West formally merge will also depend on who wins or loses this war?

### New Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi Pays Respects to Chairman Chiang, Reports on Talks with Roosevelt, Date of Assumption of Office Not Yet Announced

Chongqing - The new Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi paid respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek today, reporting on the current situation in Britain, his talks with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull when passing through the United States, and the situations in Honolulu, the Philippines, Singapore, and Yangon. The date of Guo's assumption of office has not yet been announced. (Reuters, 28th)

Chongqing - The new Foreign Minister and former Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi, arrived here yesterday from Kunming. Government officials and diplomats, such as British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, Belgian Ambassador Jules Guillaume, former Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, and Foreign Minister Xu Mo, all welcomed him at the airport. Guo was full of energy and in good spirits. After getting off the plane, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with those welcoming him on the scene and foreign reporters. Regarding the Soviet-German war, he said that the international situation had been clarified as a result, placing the countries resisting aggression in one group. Guo was unwilling to express any opinions until he had submitted his report on his talks in London and Washington to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He then mentioned the Yunnan-Burma Road, saying that he had traveled 24,000 miles, traveling by car only on the segments of Rangoon and Kunming, and traveling by plane for the rest. The Yunnan-Burma Road is China's lifeline and a symbol of ABC (America, Britain, and China) cooperation, so he felt that he must make a pilgrimage to it before taking office as Foreign Minister. He was delighted to have met with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull and other leaders in the United States and received their hospitality. He also had the opportunity to see the defenses of Honolulu, Singapore, and Myanmar. The Saodang Daily commented in its welcome of Guo's arrival in Chongqing that the new Foreign Minister had already made important achievements while returning home from London via the United States, exchanging letters with Hull on the United States' abandonment of extraterritorial rights in China. There was an air raid alarm in Kunming yesterday morning, so Guo's departure was slightly delayed, but Japanese planes did not fly near Kunming. Guo arrived in Kunming by car on June 24th, and Yunnan Chairman Long Yun greeted him in the suburbs. Guo said in Kunming that he had inspected the sea, land, and air defenses of Singapore and believed that the defenses were strong and could defeat any attack. The recent developments, such as the Soviet-German war, are beneficial to China. Friendly countries are providing China with all possible assistance. The Yunnan-Burma Road has now received as much attention overseas as the Atlantic. He was deeply impressed by the condition of this road and hoped that it would continue to be improved. Yu Feipeng, who is in charge of the administrative affairs of the Yunnan-Burma Road, arrived in Chongqing on the same plane as Guo. (Reuters, 28th)

### 52 Japanese Aircraft Attack Sichuan in Batches

Chongqing - On the 28th, 52 Japanese aircraft attacked Sichuan in two batches. The first batch of 27 aircraft entered the southern suburbs of Chongqing at 1:52 pm, dropped bombs, and then fled. The losses were very minor. The second batch of 25 aircraft flew to Zhongxian, then turned back and dropped bombs in Wanxian, and then fled. The damage is unknown. (28th Dispatch)

Chongqing - This afternoon, 54 Japanese aircraft bombed the South Hot Springs, a place quite far from Chongqing on the south bank of the Yangtze River. The air raid alarm was issued when Japanese aircraft were spotted entering Sichuan. Just as the Japanese aircraft appeared over the city, a sudden thunderstorm occurred. Apparently, due to the low cloud cover, the Japanese aircraft abandoned their attempt to bomb Chongqing and shifted their attention to the South Hot Springs, 15 miles from Chongqing. (Reuters, 28th)

Chongqing - An air raid alarm was issued in Chongqing this afternoon, but soon the sky became overcast, so the Japanese aircraft were unable to attack.

### Chongqing Newspaper Calls on Democratic Countries to Launch an Offensive Against Japan, Defeat the Japanese Army Before Japan Attacks Siberia, Allowing the Soviet Union to Concentrate Its Forces to Resist Western Front Aggression

Chongqing - The Central Daily News recently called on the democratic countries to launch an attack against Japan quickly and without further delay. The newspaper stated that the most urgent and effective way to aid the Soviet Union is for China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and Australia to jointly launch an offensive against Japan, defeating Japan before Japan attacks Siberia. If this is done, Moscow can concentrate its forces to cope with the aggression on the western front. The Communist Party's newspaper Xinhua Daily stated that the Soviet-German war has caused Japan to postpone its southward advance, but Japan's anti-communist elements are now actively planning to attack Siberia and occupy Vladivostok. In order to achieve the freedom to advance north, Japan may accelerate the war against China so that the Japanese army in mainland China can be transferred to Manchuria. The newspaper also stated that in order to implement the northward advance plan, the Konoe cabinet may be replaced. The Xinmin Daily stated emphatically that regardless of whether Germany or the Soviet Union wins, China will win. If the Soviet Union wins, China will also win against Japan, but if the German army reaches Moscow, Japan will attack Siberia, and Britain and the United States will also clash with Japan, prompting Japan's early collapse. The newspaper also pointed out that if Japan attacks Siberia, the Communist Party's 18th Group Army will launch a fierce attack on the Japanese army in North China to aid the Soviet Union. (United Press, 28th)

Chongqing - The Saodang Daily recently called on the 18th Group Army to launch an offensive against Japan to aid the Soviet Union. The newspaper stated, "Now, the 18th Group Army, in view of the fact that the interests of its motherland China and the Third International have become aligned, should launch an eastern offensive to ravage the left flank of the Japanese Kwantung Army in order to defend China and Siberia. The Chinese Communist Party should thoroughly correct its past attitude of disregarding national interests. We now hope to see these people realize this new effort." (28th Dispatch)

Luce stated that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is the greatest leader in Asia since Emperor Kangxi, and that Madame Chiang has an extremely moving personality. The Chiang Kai-sheks will lead hundreds of millions of people in the modern era and will be forever unforgettable to future generations. Luce also describes his meeting with He Yingqin, saying, "I thought he was a rough person, but I found him to be very gentle in appearance and demeanor." Luce also said that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, is the most pleasant person in China and the most capable diplomat. (United Press International, 28th)

### Fierce Battles on the Belorussian Border, Soviet Troops Retreat to New Positions, German Troops Approach Site of Napoleon's Defeat, Battle for Galicia Region Underway, Red Army Crosses Danube River and Occupies Oliten Territory

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 28th - Military observers here recently stated that the battle lines between the Soviet Union and Germany are currently roughly as follows: (1) On the central front, after Soviet troops retreated to the border of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, German troops are about to advance directly on Minsk, the capital of the republic. The Soviet retreat was preceded by strategic counterattacks, aided by aircraft, indicating a planned operation. It is noteworthy that the battlefield the German troops are now approaching is the site of Napoleon's defeat many years ago. (2) On the northern front, the Red Army continues to defend the line of the Daugava River, with German troops advancing very slowly from Latvia. (3) On the southern front, part of the German forces are hindered by swampy terrain. Although the counterattack by the Red Army's mechanized units in the Volhynia region has been successful, their flanks are threatened. At the same time, several Red Army divisions near Lviv are also at risk of being encircled.

Reuters, London, 28th - Moscow Radio announced today that fierce battles are currently underway around Lviv in the Galician region and the towns around Bialystok in northeastern Poland, with both sides alternating between offense and defense.

TASS, Moscow, 28th - The Soviet Information Bureau announced in its war report today that "fierce battles are taking place in the areas of Salay, Vilnius, and Baranovichi. After inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, our troops began to withdraw to new positions on the night of the 27th to reorganize for further actions. Fierce battles raged throughout the night in the Lutsk area and the Skureny area on the Bessarabian front. There was no fighting on other fronts. On the night of the 27th, enemy aircraft heavily bombed Borisov (northeast of Minsk), Bobruisk (southeast of Minsk), and Mogilev (east of Minsk). On the 26th, our air force continued to attack enemy tank units in Vilnius, Brody, and Baranovichi. The enemy suffered very heavy losses. Our aircraft heavily bombed Ploesti and inflicted heavy damage, and Constanta was also heavily bombed by our forces, suffering significant losses."

United Press International, London, 28th - The announcement by Moscow last night that Soviet troops were withdrawing to new positions indicates that the Red Army is now retreating to the Stalin Line within the old Soviet borders in the Minsk province. Military observers here say that Moscow's announcement of constant Nazi air raids on Borisov, Bobruisk, and Mogilev indicates that a large number of Soviet troops are concentrated in several strongholds behind the Stalin Line. During the First European War, Minsk was the headquarters of the Red Army in Belorussia, and Mogilev was the headquarters of Grand Duke Nicholas, the commander-in-chief of the Russian army. It is generally believed that Germany's relentless bombing of Borisov and the other three cities is a consistent Nazi strategy to destroy concentration points behind the lines before attacking the positions.

Reuters, London, 28th - A recent Soviet communique announced that there were no new aerial battles, but for the first time mentioned the Soviet fleet, saying that it had cooperated with the air force in bombing the German naval base of Constanta on the Romanian Black Sea coast. The communique also said that yesterday a Soviet cavalry division routed a German regiment in Bessarabia, and that last night a Soviet force, aided by small warships, forced its way into the Danube River, occupied advantageous positions, and captured 500 enemy soldiers, 11 cannons, and a large quantity of ammunition. On the northern section of the front, the Soviet side announced that it had launched a counterattack during the retreat, inflicting a major defeat on the enemy. A large-scale attack by German tanks on Minsk (the capital of Belorussia, within 20 miles of Russia proper) had been repelled, a German headquarters had been captured, and a German general had been killed. Forty German tanks had been destroyed. In the Lutsk and Lviv areas, German forces had deployed large numbers of tanks to join the battle in an attempt to break through the lines, but repeated attempts to attack had been repulsed by Soviet forces and suffered heavy losses. On the Bessarabian front, German preparations for a major offensive near Skureny on the Prut River had been thwarted. On the Romanian border, Soviet forces captured a total of 800 German and Romanian soldiers. The communique concluded with a proud statement that the entire front from Bialystok to the Black Sea was now firmly defended by our forces.

### Germans Claim Soviet Division Destroyed

Reuters, London, 28th - The German official news agency reported on the war situation, stating that German forces had destroyed a large number of tanks and captured many intact tanks. In one sector, the German Bavarian Alpine Mountain Army crushed a Soviet armored division, capturing many cannons and destroying a hundred tanks. In another sector, a Soviet division and its attached armored regiment were annihilated. The people of the Soviet-occupied border welcomed the German troops who had come to liberate them. A Lithuanian artillery unit and a Cossack unit of 200 men had surrendered to the German army. The German air force had also achieved victories. One squadron had destroyed 21 Soviet aircraft and scattered a Soviet truck convoy.

### Leningrad Threatened on Three Sides

According to Lyon Radio, fierce battles are raging around Lviv (Lemberg). Although non-official sources on the Axis side claim that German troops have occupied Lviv, the area is still largely in Soviet hands. The radio station also said that the Nazi side believes that after five days of fierce fighting, the border battle can be considered over, with the results completely in favor of the German side. Attention is now focused on Leningrad, which is now threatened on three sides by German troops and Finnish troops within the Baltic states and by aerial bombardment. Four Soviet divisions are currently concentrated around Leningrad.

### German Crossing of the Prut River Thwarted

Continued fighting in the Skureny region suggests that German efforts to force a crossing of the Prut River into northeastern Bessarabia have not made any progress. Dispatches from Ankara say that the German forced crossing has failed, and Soviet troops are valiantly counterattacking in various places. Soviet sources report that Soviet aircraft have bombed military targets in Ploesti, the Romanian oil city, and Constanta on the Black Sea coast, causing them significant damage.

### Hungarian Air Force Attacks Soviet Union

Within hours of Hungary's declaration of war on the Soviet Union yesterday, the Hungarian air force launched an attack on the Soviet Union. Hungarian Radio broadcast a communique from the German general staff of the Hungarian army, saying that in retaliation for the Soviet air raids on Hungary, a large number of Hungarian aircraft had attacked Soviet military targets, causing fires and heavy damage. Soviet artillery units in several areas of the front had been retaliated against by Hungarian artillery units. Today (Friday), Soviet aircraft again flew over Hungarian territory but were unable to drop bombs and were driven back by Hungarian defenses.

### Baltic Naval District Declares Martial Law

The Soviet troops fighting the German mechanized units advancing on Minsk are commanded by General Kuznetsov, a young Soviet general. Kuznetsov was the commander of the North Caucasus Military District last year and was transferred to the commander of the Baltic Special Military District last month. Last night, he issued an order declaring martial law in the three Baltic states and instructed the people to fulfill their duty to the motherland and assist the army in resisting paratroopers and the Fifth Column. Anyone found assisting the enemy will be tried and punished by a military tribunal. Informed sources in Ankara confirm that the Axis forces have failed to force a crossing of the Prut River into Bessarabia. Soviet troops on the southern front are fighting with great bravery. Soviet aircraft have attacked military targets in Ploesti, causing them heavy damage. Dispatches from Ankara report that Soviet troops are attacking and counterattacking at various points on the southern front. Ankara continues to transmit startling news from the Axis powers, such as the destruction of 2,000 Soviet aircraft in the first two days of the war. However, the ratio of Soviet aircraft destroyed on the ground and in the air transmitted by these messages is vastly different.

### Red Army Soldiers Fight Bravely

Soviet communiques state that our soldiers are fighting with great bravery. General Mantin's armored division dispersed an enemy motorized unit preparing to cross the river, destroying six enemy cannons and three pontoons. Half of the enemy troops were killed or wounded. Lieutenant Matruk shot down three enemy aircraft in aerial combat. Lieutenant Xian engaged in a fierce battle with German fighter aircraft for an hour, and although he sustained three wounds, he safely returned to his defenses. The people are doing their best to assist the army in fighting and are very clear about their duty to the motherland.

### Turku, Finland, Heavily Bombed

Swedish newspapers report from Helsinki that Soviet bombers attacked Turku, Finland, on Thursday night in waves of seven or nine aircraft, dropping bombs in a heavy bombardment. Turku has been attacked for two days, resulting in ten deaths and twenty-seven injuries. According to news from Stockholm, there is widespread criticism of the German communiques there. Berlin is rife with rumors, all awaiting good news. A dispatch from a Swedish visitor in Berlin said that so far Berlin has not announced any concrete news. Rumors about the progress of the war mostly come from foreign sources. Many Berliners say that "German troops are advancing rapidly and unimpeded," so there has not been time to publish detailed war reports. The Berlin military no longer talks about when victory will be achieved.

### German Forces Launch Offensive in the Far North

Reuters, Vichy, 28th - The French news agency reported from Stockholm, Sweden, that Colonel Brett, a Swedish military expert, claimed that German Alpine troops had launched an offensive from Norway towards the Kola Peninsula and the port of Murmansk. At the same time, German aircraft were bombing the peninsula's highly modernized air force base. Brett also criticized the difference between the German offensive against the Soviet Union and the strategy used in the invasion of France last year, saying that the German General Staff seemed to recognize that the Soviet Union's motorized cavalry was superior to the French, so the German leaders did not immediately commit tanks to the forefront of the fighting, but sometimes first used artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and aerial reconnaissance, and only added tanks in the second phase of the attack. Reuters, Stockholm, 28th - According to Finnish newspapers, Finnish artillery will begin bombarding the Soviet defenses in the port of Hanko. The port originally belonged to Finland but was ceded to the Soviet Union last year.

### Cossacks Inflict Heavy Damage on German Troops

United Press International, Moscow, 28th - Another communique today said that six German infantry regiments attempting to cross the Prut River had been annihilated by savage Cossacks. The communique continued, saying that the German attempt to flank Lviv had also been repulsed. Fierce fighting is taking place in the Minsk and Lutsk areas. The German 39th Tank Corps has been defeated.

### Nazi Paratroopers All Annihilated

United Press International, Moscow, 28th - Colonel Spirlet told reporters here yesterday that the German paratroopers who had landed behind Soviet lines had been completely annihilated. These German paratroopers were all wearing Red Army uniforms or Soviet police uniforms. He said that on Thursday, armed peasants in the Lviv region captured a group of German paratroopers wearing Soviet police uniforms, who were carrying Soviet trade coupons and typewriters.

### German Troops Using Deception in Warfare

Reuters, London, 28th - According to the Soviet official news agency, three days ago a German regiment, disguised in Red Army uniforms, attempted to invade Soviet territory. A Soviet company at the time had bombarded them with heavy artillery fire. However, after the German soldiers shouted, "We are friends, stop firing!" the Soviet troops, unsuspecting of treachery, immediately ceased fire. Soon after, they discovered that they had been surrounded. After recognizing that they were German soldiers in disguise, they immediately used hand grenades to fight their way out and sprayed the German troops with heavy machine guns, inflicting heavy losses on them, before narrowly escaping annihilation.

### Rumors of Soviet Capital Moving in Preparation for Prolonged War, Anti-Soviet Conspiracy Uncovered in Moscow

United Press International, Stockholm, 28th - The "Aftonbladet" newspaper here yesterday received news from Ankara that the Soviet government plans to move its capital from Moscow to Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains. It also said that a "large anti-Soviet conspiracy" had been discovered in Moscow, and the authorities had arrested dozens of people involved.

Havas News Agency, Moscow, 27th - "Pravda" published an editorial today stating, "The German-Soviet war may be prolonged. Temporary setbacks should not lead to despair. We should also prepare for the greatest sacrifices to overcome difficulties. No matter how things develop in the future, our country will achieve final victory."

### German Victory Report to Be Published Today

United Press International, Berlin, 28th - After two postponements, the High Command has now definitely announced that a special report will be published on Sunday, June 29th, revealing a major German victory on the Eastern Front.

### Countries Under Nazi Yoke Form Anti-Soviet Front, Denmark Announces Severance of Relations with Soviet Union, Vichy Wishes to Stay Out of It

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 28th - As of last night, ten of the fourteen countries in Europe had joined the anti-Soviet front, but France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and Greece are not included. Their war materials are available for Germany to use freely. Of these ten countries, seven have declared war on the Soviet Union, namely Germany, Italy, Romania, Finland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia. In addition, Sweden, Spain, and Denmark either expressed sympathy, sent volunteer troops to attack the Soviet Union, severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, or otherwise expressed neutrality, such as Switzerland, Portugal, Turkey, and Bulgaria, but all expressed sympathy with Germany. In both the free and occupied zones of France, volunteers are being recruited. As for the volunteers from Norway, they have already set off for the Finnish front.

Reuters, London, 28th - Denmark, under the yoke of Germany no less than Hungary, is reported to have severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

### Litvinov Reported to Re-emerge

United Press International, Rome, 28th - The "Corriere della Sera" newspaper in Rome today published a message from Ankara, citing Soviet diplomatic sources as saying that former Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov will be appointed to a senior government position. According to these sources, Litvinov will be appointed as the diplomatic director for all matters related to the cooperation between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States.

Havas News Agency, Vichy, 27th - Sources here recently stated that France is completely staying out of the current German-Soviet war. Marshal Pétain's trip to Paris is unrelated to the Soviet-Finnish War or international issues. The Franco-Spanish talks are continuing to be conducted by the relevant authorities and there is unlikely to be any important development in the short term. Some newspapers in Paris have published reports that volunteers organized by Déat, the leader of the "Rassemblement National Populaire," intend to participate in the war against the Soviet Union. The Vichy government has no knowledge of this and considers it purely imaginary.

### Soviet Agricultural and Transport Industries Forced to Work Overtime

Reuters, Moscow, 28th - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has issued an order requiring supervisors in the agricultural, industrial, and transport sectors to implement a system of forced overtime work, ranging from one to three hours per day. Pregnant women and nursing mothers are exempt. Overtime work will be paid at half the basic wage. The Presidium will announce an order granting allowances to the families of officers and soldiers during wartime.

### British Military and Economic Missions Arrive in Moscow, Molotov Immediately Receives Them, Britain Decides to Fulfill Its Promise of Aid to the Soviet Union

TASS, Moscow, 28th - British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Stafford Cripps has returned to Moscow. Arriving with him are the British military and economic missions. The military mission includes Lieutenant General MacFarlane, Vice Admiral Miles, and Air Vice Marshal Collyer. The economic mission includes Carter and three others. Among those welcoming them at the station were the Secretary-General of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Sublev, and personnel from the British Embassy.

Reuters, London, 28th - British Ambassador Sir Stafford Cripps, accompanied by the British military and economic missions, has returned to Moscow. He subsequently visited Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov to introduce the members of the mission and his entire diplomatic staff. The members of the British military mission include Lieutenant General MacFarlane, Acting Captain Acland, Air Vice Marshal Collyer, and Rear Admiral Miles. The fact that the mission arrived in Moscow within five days of Prime Minister Churchill's guarantee of aid to the Soviet Union and that the members of the mission are all capable people shows that the British government is fully fulfilling its promise. Lieutenant General MacFarlane, 51, is the highest British authority on German military tactics. He served as the military attache in Germany during Hitler's preparations for war, and before that, he served as military attache in Prague, Budapest, and Vienna. It was MacFarlane who delivered Hitler's "final conditions" to Prague during the Munich crisis. After the outbreak of war, MacFarlane went to France as director of military intelligence and was responsible for security during the King's inspection of the front lines. Rear Admiral Miles, 51, is a navigation expert and former commander of the Mediterranean minesweeping and destroyer fleets. From 1939, he was the captain of the battleship HMS Nelson. Air Vice Marshal Collyer represents the British Air Force. He was a member of the British mission to Moscow during the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in 1939. From 1934 to 1937, he was the first British air force attache to the Soviet Union.

### Soviet General to Adopt a War of Attrition to Trap German Forces - Observations from the Japanese Commercial Newspaper

Tokyo, June 28 (Reuters) - Today's "Chugai Commercial News" published an article commenting on the Soviet-German war, questioning whether a decisive victory would be determined in the short term, or whether it would become a protracted war. The article stated that this question is of utmost importance to Japan, and that Japan's policy toward the European war must consider this question before determining its course. Germany seems confident that it can end the war within two or three months, but it is questionable whether the Soviet Union will allow Germany to succeed in this strategy. The Soviet Union will likely adopt a strategy of attrition to trap the German forces, and if so, retreating to the Ural Mountains would be a sound strategy. This strategy was once used to defeat Napoleon, but it is doubtful whether this old strategy can still be applied in modern warfare. The article concluded that Britain and the United States likely hope that the war will be prolonged. As the war progresses, their assistance to the Soviet Union will intensify, and changes in the Far East relationship must be taken into account.

### General Gamelin Flees - Major Search in French Territory

Vichy, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - General Gamelin, who once served as the commander-in-chief of the Anglo-French Allied Forces, was arrested by General Pétain on September 16 of last year and subsequently confined with several other political leaders in the Polla Saul Building. Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, General Gamelin escaped from the building and his whereabouts are unknown. A nationwide secret search is underway.

### Welles' Statement - U.S. Decides to Provide Material Aid to the Soviet Union - Umansky Extremely Excited - "Toho" Newspaper Believes It Is a Threat to Japan

Washington, June 27 (TASS) - After a meeting between Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky and U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles today, he told reporters, "I called on the Acting Secretary of State, Welles, to formally inform him of the predatory attack by the Soviet Union. I have received a clear answer from the Acting Secretary of State regarding the US government's attitude toward this attack and the future relationship between the US and the Soviet Union. The Acting Secretary of State announced that any issues arising from the German attack on Soviet territory will receive the immediate and friendly attention of the US government. On June 23, I presented Welles with Molotov's speech. This conversation was extremely exciting." The State Department also announced that Umansky had visited Welles to formally inform the State Department of the fact of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Welles told Umansky that "in accordance with the policies declared by the US President and the State Department, any material assistance requested by the Soviet government will receive the immediate and friendly attention and consideration of the US."

Washington, June 28 (International News Service) - Yesterday, the Senate government faction predicted that the non-interventionist faction's attempts to prevent supplies from being shipped to the Soviet Union would be defeated. There may be a war of words regarding President Roosevelt's policy of trying his best to aid the Soviet Union. Soviet Ambassador Umansky's visit to Under Secretary of State Welles and the failure to express any reaction from Moscow to the US proposal to aid the Soviet Union is now attracting great attention.

Hyde Park, June 28 (Reuters) - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday about US aid to the Soviet Union to resist Germany, saying that he would discuss the matter with Welles when he received the report on Thursday's conversation between the Soviet ambassador and Under Secretary of State Welles. When a reporter asked how long it would take for the United States to produce a large number of national defense supplies, the President replied that such a broad question could not be answered practically. The time required varies depending on the item. The production of some items has already reached its peak, while other items will not reach their peak until six months, eight months, or a year later.

Rome, June 27 (Havas) - The "Sella Daily" here recently carried news that all the ships of the Baltic Sea coastal countries, which were mostly anchored in American ports after these countries were incorporated into the Soviet Union, may now be used by the United States to transport arms to the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union only has 50,000 ships overseas, which is not enough to meet the demand. In short, the extent of US aid to the Soviet Union will depend entirely on Japan's attitude.

Japanese Side Discusses Military Status

Tokyo, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Konoe met with military generals yesterday to discuss Japan's military status. At the same time, former Home Minister General Suekichi and former Prime Minister General Hayashi, etc., also discussed the political situation with leaders of various political parties.

Tokyo, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - At yesterday's cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Matsuoka gave a report on the German-Soviet war. After the meeting, Matsuoka met with German Ambassador Ott for an hour and a half. The content was not announced.

Tokyo, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese Army Minister Tojo met with the Japanese Emperor this morning to report on military issues. In the afternoon, Japanese political leaders will meet again with senior army and navy officials to discuss important matters. Prime Minister Konoe will personally chair the meeting.

Washington, June 28 (United Press) - People here today predict that Japan may block Vladivostok.

Tokyo, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - A Japanese government spokesman said that we must pay attention to what kind of assistance the United States will provide to the Soviet Union from Vladivostok. If the United States provides aid to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok, it would be very dangerous, and Japan would be in a difficult position. The spokesman continued that Japan would not issue an official statement on the German-Soviet conflict for the time being, so I cannot express anything.

Tokyo, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - Regarding the US official's announced promise to aid the Soviet Union, Japanese newspapers regard it as a threat to Japan. They all say that Japan should prevent US munitions from reaching Vladivostok via the Pacific Ocean. The "Asahi Shimbun," "Kokumin Shimbun," and "Yomiuri Shimbun" all said that effective US aid to the Soviet Union can be regarded as an indirect hostile attitude toward Japan, and its intention to threaten Japan's position is self-evident.

June 28 (United Press) - Responsible Japanese officials here yesterday believed that if US warships patrolled the West Pacific to ensure that US supplies were not plundered by Germany on their way to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok, Japan could not remain indifferent to the matter.

British Newspapers Say Japan Is Confused and at a Loss

London, June 28 (Reuters) - Today's editorial in the "Manchester Guardian" said that Japan is truly unfortunate. It has been painstakingly operating to harm its neighbors and benefit itself, but its actions are often unsatisfactory. Although it boasts of military victories, its war against the stubborn and undefeated China has so far kept it exhausted. Although it celebrates diplomatic success, today it does not know what to do. Hitler's war against the Soviet Union, from one perspective, has made Japan confused and at a loss. Japan's old policy could be an immediate temptation to attack the Soviet Union, but the war in China is holding it back, and the British and American declarations of their intention to do everything possible to aid the Soviet Union cannot be ignored. If it attacks the Soviet Union, while the war of resistance in China is still very strong, the US warning cannot be ignored, and the strength of the Soviet Union should not be underestimated, it would be a very dangerous gamble. Japan's embarrassing situation is mostly due to Hitler. Hitler first encouraged Japan's anti-communist sentiments, then recognized the Soviet Union as a friend, stimulating Japan, and then wooed the Soviet Union and Japan to form a new alliance. Finally, less than three months after the Soviet-Japanese alliance, he suddenly attacked the Soviet Union, making Japan laugh and cry.

Bombay, June 28 (Reuters) - Indian newspapers commented on the difficult position Japan encountered due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The "Times of India" said that the Japanese government has been hesitating for several days, trying to reconcile what cannot be reconciled and solve what cannot be solved, and as a result, there is no successful method. It has no choice but to sit and watch the war between the two major countries to which Japan has corresponding treaty obligations. Compared to German diplomacy, Japan is just an infant in its arms. Japan was full of confidence that it had the guarantee of Soviet neutrality to guard against, but it never considered the possibility of a Soviet-German conflict. Matsuoka may now realize that Hitler is not easy to deal with, and that the value of the treaty with Germany is worthless, and is considering changing his plans. The "Madras Mail" also said that the most difficult issue arising from the Soviet-German war is Japan's attitude. The Japanese are not stupid, and they should now understand the ultimate fate of cooperating with Hitler. If the Soviet Union is defeated, Japan will face an even greater crisis of being driven by Germany.

### British Air Force Launches Fierce Offensive Against Germany, Bombing German Industrial Areas and Naval Ports

London, June 28 (Reuters) - The British Air Force launched an extremely fierce offensive against Germany and the occupied areas yesterday. During the day, British planes soared over the English Channel skies once and roamed over northern France twice. At night, they again attacked German industrial areas and naval bases in Kiel, Cologne, and Dusseldorf. At sunset, British bombers, protected by large squadrons of fighters, flew out in batches, and soon the vibrations of exploding bombs were heard across the Channel, and the sound of cannons boomed. German land defenses obviously increased their resistance. The Air Ministry's information office said that the first to launch the attack during the day were the Ballenham coastal bombers, protected by fighters. One plane dropped a bomb on a German supply ship in the Channel, hitting its stern and sinking immediately. An enemy ship with a load of about 3,000 tons was also dive-bombed. When the first attack was launched during the day, two squadrons of Polish fighters searched for enemy planes but did not encounter them, so they attacked enemy airfields, strafing the hangars. Three enemy planes were destroyed in the field, and four were damaged. When Kiel was bombed, many bombs fell, and docks and shipyards caught fire. The German Coastal Defense Command is now located there, and it is also the main base for the German Navy's attack on the Soviet Union. When British planes attacked Cologne and Dusseldorf, the weather was poor, but they still found their targets and bombed them fiercely. Several German fighters intercepted British planes attacking Cologne, but one was shot down.

London, June 28 (Reuters) - In order to continue its continuous offensive throughout the day, the British Air Force repeatedly flew across the English Channel and northern France yesterday, followed by night attacks on targets in northwestern Germany. Many squadrons were dispatched across the English Channel again this morning. Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven were the targets of heavy bombing. Twelve British bombers were missing. This morning, multiple squadrons of British planes flew across the coast from two different directions. After crossing the French coast, the British planes went deep inland to carry out bombing, so residents on this side of the English Channel only heard distant explosions and saw large squadrons of British planes flying high in formation an hour later. Most of them seemed to be fighters. Enemy plane activity over Britain last night was still on a small scale. Bombs fell in western Britain, South Wales, and various parts of East Anglia. A small number of residents were injured, and the damage was minimal. One enemy bomber was destroyed last night.

### American Planes Show Their Skills in the Western Desert Air War

London, June 28 (Reuters) - New-style American-made Tomahawk bombers and fighters showed their skills in the Western Desert air war on Thursday. Among them, the Tomahawk fighter was still in its first large-scale engagement with German planes. According to an Air Ministry press release, at least twelve enemy planes were destroyed in the air battle, and many more were severely damaged. An Australian pilot who drove a Tomahawk fighter to attack the Ghazala airfield told people that we saw several enemy planes parked on the south side of the airfield, and immediately dropped bombs and bombed them, none of which escaped. It is said that one of the most intense scenes in the air battle was when ten Tomahawk fighters engaged thirty German Me-109s, shooting down at least four German planes and destroying many others. Later, they shot down an Italian fighter. According to an air force pilot, the performance of the Tomahawk plane is great.

### German Embassy in China Issues Statement

Shanghai, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - Mr. Code, the information officer of the German Embassy in China, issued the following press release yesterday: I heard several days ago the false reports about the air battle in the English Channel issued by the British. I am now specially issuing a statement based on the accurate reports from Germany, as follows: The Tventri radio station repeatedly claimed that the British Air Force's attack on Belgium and northern France was the largest air raid in the history of war. In particular, the number of aircraft dispatched by the British aircraft in the air raid on the area on the 25th exceeded the number of aircraft dispatched by the German Air Force in its most fierce night raid. This statement obviously wants to make the world, especially the United States, believe that Britain is taking offensive action to rescue the Soviet Union. According to the actual situation at the time, the first batch of British aircraft carried out an air raid from 12:24 pm to 4:50 pm on June 25, with a total of 12 Blenheim aircraft, covered by 50 Spitfires. The second batch of British aircraft raided the area from 4:30 pm to 4:50 pm, with a total of 15 Blenheim aircraft and 60 Spitfires. The statement by Tventri radio station that the British planes lost a total of six planes in the two air raids does not match the facts. The actual loss of British planes was 24 Spitfires and 2 Blenheim aircraft, of which 21 Spitfires were shot down by German destroyers, and the rest were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. The German aircraft only lost three. In the two air raids by British aircraft, no military targets were damaged. Civilians suffered slight casualties, and several houses were destroyed. The British's exaggerated propaganda about the air force offensive is ridiculous. In fact, the number of aircraft dispatched by German aircraft groups in the air raids on the three islands of Britain often exceeded the number of British aircraft mentioned above by five times.

### British Foreign Secretary Meets with Swedish Envoy, Expresses Serious Views on Allowing German Troops to Pass Through

London, June 28 (Reuters) - Foreign Secretary Eden met with Swedish envoy Prytz at the Foreign Office yesterday afternoon, and said that the British government holds very serious views on the Swedish government allowing a German division to pass through on its way to the Soviet front.

London, June 28 (Reuters) - According to a correspondent from the Free French News Agency in the Swedish capital, Germany's urgent request for Sweden to allow its army to pass through is due to (1) Finland's hesitation, (2) Germany's lack of transport ships, and (3) both sides having installed hydro-electric power in the Baltic Sea, making navigation very dangerous. According to a Swedish government spokesman, it will take about two days for the German troops to pass through Swedish territory.

### Rumor That Germany Asks Turkey for Passage, Unable to Verify

London, June 28 (Reuters) - Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that it is rumored that German Ambassador to Turkey Papen has proposed to Turkey that German troops pass through Turkey to attack the British army in Syria. In any case, informed sources in London have been unable to verify this.

### Soviet Union Warns Turkey, Time to Recognize Friend and Foe

Moscow, June 28 (TASS) - When Kemal led the Turkish people in their struggle for survival, the Soviet Union began a friendly relationship with Turkey. Three days after the establishment of the National Assembly on April 11, 1920, Kemal sent a telegram to the Soviet government requesting assistance. Since then, whenever Turkey has encountered difficulties, the Soviet Union has always provided assistance with a disinterested attitude. At the Lausanne Conference in 1922 and 1923, Turkey requested the straits, and the Soviet Union again provided various assistance. The Soviet Union also took the same position at the Montreux Conference in 1936. Most recently, after the German fascist robber army occupied the islands at the entrance of the straits, the Soviet Union also assured Turkey that it would abide by neutrality. All of this is well known to the world. In order to undermine the friendly relationship between the Soviet Union and Turkey, Hitler spread rumors, falsely claiming that the Soviet Union requested to occupy Istanbul and the Bosphorus Strait. It is not surprising that such nonsense comes from Hitler, but it is puzzling that Turkish newspapers published it. Regarding this matter, Molotov reiterated the Soviet Union's position on the 22nd. It is time for Turkish newspapers to distinguish between friend and foe.

### British Army's Attack on Syria Continues to Progress, German Planes Bomb Damascus

Jerusalem, June 28 (Reuters) - The allied forces attacking from Damascus are advancing rapidly and have reached Nibeck, 35 miles northeast of Damascus, halfway between the city and the important center of Homs. The allied forces on the west side of the Homs highway, who attacked Sayyidnaya yesterday, have now broken through the area and are continuing to advance, but are encountering resistance from the Vichy army. At the same time, the main force of the British Empire army advancing along the coast has advanced four miles and has reached Wadi al-Kharrar (dried-up riverbed) north of Qasouba, no more than fifteen miles from Beirut, and has sent troops to launch an offensive patrol inland. The British Navy is currently shelling the French front lines at Damour, halfway between Sidon and Beirut.

Damascus, June 28 (Reuters) - On Wednesday last week, German planes bombed the Syrian capital Damascus, killing 70 people, injuring 29, and destroying more than 100 houses. Bombs fell within ten yards of the famous Umayyad Mosque and the tomb of Saladin, and the windows and walls were shattered. After investigation, French military officials determined that the bombs were dropped by German planes.

### Vichy Officials Fly to Ankara, Entrusted with Two Missions

London, June 28 (Reuters) - The Independent French News Agency's Istanbul correspondent reported that Médecin, the assistant to Vichy State Minister Darlan, has recently flown to Ankara. It is believed that Médecin is carrying a letter from General Pétain to Turkish President Inonu. It is reported that this mission has two purposes: (1) to negotiate the route for the Vichy army to withdraw from Syria into Turkey, and (2) to dispel Turkey's negative impressions of Darlan's recent speech. The question of the Franco-Turkish alliance, which still exists in principle, may also be discussed.

### U.S. President and Congressmen Discuss Aid to Southern Ireland

Hyde Park, June 28 (Reuters) - President Roosevelt discussed the issue of how to aid Ireland with four congressmen related to Southern Ireland here yesterday. Ireland has chartered three ships to transport food worth 500,000 yuan, but President Roosevelt did not inform the congressmen that the three ships had already sailed. As for the American rifles without ammunition, it is still unknown whether it will help Ireland. The President claimed that the existing factories for manufacturing ordnance are sufficient, but factories for manufacturing ammunition still need to be added.

### Dutch Armory Explodes

The newspaper also said that many Dutch and German people must have been killed.

### The Current Situation and Evolution of Ukraine

The Ukrainian Republic, famous for its black soil belt and as the "Granary of Europe," is one of the three major parts of the European section of the Soviet Union.

(Territory) To the north it borders the Belorussian Republic, to the east and northeast it borders the Russian mainland, and to the west it borders Poland—in 1939, it divided and seized eastern Poland with Germany, namely the area east of the Bug and San rivers, tributaries of the Vistula River—to the southwest it is bordered by Romania via the Dniester River, and to the south it faces the Black Sea, into which the famous Crimean Peninsula extends. Its

(Area) is 443,000 square kilometers, a large part of the European Plain, with an average elevation of around 100 meters above sea level. There are no high mountains, only winding and undulating small hills, none exceeding 150 meters above sea level.

(Major Rivers) There are four: the westernmost Dniester River, then eastward the Bug River, then the most famous Dnieper River, which conveniently divides Ukraine into two major parts, and the easternmost Donets River, a tributary of the Don River. The rivers all flow from northwest to southeast, except for the Dnieper River, which makes a bend, turning southwest halfway and entering the Black Sea.

(People) The population of Ukraine is 31.9 million, making it the most densely populated part of the Soviet Union. Its average density is 70 people per square kilometer, while the rest of the area only has 35 people per square kilometer. The ethnic group belongs to the Little Russian branch of the Slavic race. The so-called Little Russians are a general term for the steppe peoples of southern Soviet Union, relative to the Great Russians of the northern forest zone. But in reality, they are not short and small like people from a dwarf country, but taller than the Great Russians of the north. Their difference from the Great Russians is that their skulls are wider, their complexions are darker, and their hair color is also darker. Their temperament is also more cheerful and lively, full of imagination and artistry, and they easily show their true feelings.

(Resources) When it comes to the resources of Ukraine, it is no wonder that Nazi Germany coveted it, because it is the most agriculturally rich and industrially developed area. Its boundless fields, covered with a layer of fertile "black soil," are dotted with colorful and bright wildflowers in spring. Later, waves of wheat ripple, stretching to the horizon, interspersed with fields of beets and potatoes: it is truly a "granary" worthy of its name, feeding the people! Recently, cotton has been tried to be grown near the Black Sea in the south, and the results have been very good. Mineral resources are also very abundant, especially the iron reserves in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, which amount to 210 billion tons, making it one of the richest iron ore areas in the world. As for its industry, there is no need to mention anything else, but just think of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station (Dniepropetrovsk) recently built near the city of Dniepropetrovsk (at the bend in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River), equipped with nine large generators, with a total power generation of 810,000 horsepower, which can supply electricity to factories within 200 kilometers around, and you can know how rapidly its industry is developing! There are steel factories, electrical factories, chemical factories, mechanical factories, ... in short, everything that should be there is there, originally the result of two five-year plans!

Famous Cities include Kharkov, located on the upper reaches of the Donets River, with a population of 833,000, and is the capital of the Ukrainian Republic. Industry is developed, and it is also a railway hub from Moscow to the Black Sea. Kiev is located on the right bank of the Dnieper River, with a population of 850,000, and was the capital of the old Kievan Rus', enjoying a long-standing reputation in religion and art, and is also the center of the agricultural area. Odessa has a population of 600,000, located on the northern shore of the Black Sea, with deep harbors and comprehensive facilities, serving as the southern gateway to the Soviet Union, and is famous for exporting wheat from the black soil belt.

Brief History The Ukrainian region was initially the homeland of the East Goths; after they were oppressed by the Huns and moved westward, the Slavs occupied this fertile land. We know very little about the earliest history of this nation; around the 5th and 6th centuries AD, a kingdom called Autes was established; however, it was destroyed by foreign invasions in the 7th century. In 862 AD, the Northern Barbarian chieftain Rurik from the Scandinavian Peninsula settled in what is now Novgorod, establishing a country, which is the origin of present-day Russia. He had a brother named Oleg, who occupied Kiev and established a country, which is the beginning of present-day Ukraine.

In the 10th century AD, the power of a certain auxiliary state greatly expanded, and a monarch named Vladimir (980-1015) converted to Christianity. During the reign of his son Taroslav, the territory and national strength increased even more, as if the sun was at its zenith. He also corresponded with envoys from various Western European countries, and one of his princesses even married King Henry I of France.

However, a country built on the grasslands, without natural barriers, is naturally vulnerable to foreign invasions. Sure enough, in the 12th century, Kiev was seized by a prince of northern Russia, and in the 13th century, it became a dependency of the Mongols. In 1340 AD, it came under Polish rule, and the name Ukraine originated from this time. By the early 17th century, when the Romanov dynasty became emperors of Russia, they began years of bloody battles with Poland to seize Kiev, just like the states of Jin and Chu in our Spring and Autumn period fought to the death for the state of Zheng. Then Turkey joined in, and Ukraine was vividly divided into three parts: western Ukraine under Poland, eastern Ukraine under Russia, and southern Ukraine under Turkey.

At this time, a patriotic hero named Mazeppa emerged, striving for the unification of Ukraine, the same romantic hero of the literary center who was sung and praised by the English poet Byron and the French poet Hugo. In 1687 AD, he became the leader of the adventurous Cossacks—meaning "uncivilized people"—and then contacted the Russians to get rid of the shackles of the Poles. For twenty years, he lived a luxurious and literary monarchical life in his city of Batoueime, which can truly be called a period of Kievan Renaissance. Many literary works were produced, full of Western colors and Latinized humanism. When the Russian Tsar Peter the Great truly wanted to take Ukraine for himself, Mazeppa turned north and cooperated with the famous Swedish King Charles XII, who was then competing with Peter the Great. Charles XII also formally recognized Ukraine as an independent country, and he even went deep into enemy territory alone to help him. Unfortunately, in the famous Battle of Poltava in 1709 AD, Charles XII's army was completely defeated, and Mazeppa also fled to Turkey, where he ended his life in decline. Eastern Ukraine fell into the hands of Russia again.

In the second half of the 19th century, the national consciousness of Ukraine revived: it initially took the form of literature, producing folk songs, epics, etc., all full of patriotic sentiments. But the St. Petersburg government naturally tried its best to suppress it and never recognized their demands as legitimate.

(Current Situation) When the First European War broke out, Russia also experienced a social revolution in 1917. Ukraine took the opportunity to declare independence in December and convened a national assembly. In the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Russia and Germany in 1918, there was a clause recognizing its independence. But later, it became the main base for the White Russians to resist the Red Russians: the White Russians ultimately failed, and Ukraine was re-entered under the rule of the Moscow government. In 1922 AD, the Soviet Russian Federation was established, and Ukraine became one of the federated states and joined the Moscow group political system. However, Ukraine has its own unique language, and now Ukrainian has been completely adopted as the common language in all Ukrainian schools, armies, and political institutions. There is also something that outsiders do not understand much: that is, although Soviet Russia overthrew religion and promoted atheism, the Ukrainians are full of the spirit of religious revival; they not only want to revive the Eastern Orthodox Church, but also have great hopes of reconciling with the old Roman Pope in order to return to the old Catholic Church. Now it is encountering a serious dangerous stage again, who knows what its future fate will be? Reference books include the French Encyclopedia, General Geography, Larousse Illustrated Magazine, October 1934.

### Zhejiang Education Department Plans to Provide Relief to Students from Ningbo and Shaoxing Who Have Lost Their Schooling; Has Requested the Central Government to Establish Two Middle Schools

(Lishui Correspondent) How to provide relief to students from Ningbo and Shaoxing who have lost their schooling due to the fall of those areas is currently the most serious issue in Zhejiang Province's education sector. A reporter from Shenjiang News visited Xu Shaodi, the Director of the Education Department, to inquire about everything. According to reports, the Education Department is actively planning to provide relief to students from Ningbo and Shaoxing who have lost their schooling. This decision was made after the Japanese army captured Ningbo and Shaoxing, and four schools, including the Provincial Shaoxing Middle School, the Provisional Fourth Middle School of Western Zhejiang in Yuyao, the Ningbo Vocational High School of Technology, and the Sericulture School, were withdrawn from the war zone. Due to budget cuts, it was decided to temporarily suspend operations. Private schools in the counties have been relocated after repeated migrations, and there are still 19 schools that have been unable to withdraw. A few schools have withdrawn a small number of students to safer places and are struggling to support themselves and find ways to resume classes. However, based on their current situation and environment, it is feared that they will not be able to sustain this for long. It is estimated that there are a total of 23 secondary schools in the Ningbo and Shaoxing war zone, with a total of more than 8,000 students. A total of 1,099 students are expected to graduate this semester, and 7,320 have not yet graduated. Graduates either continue their education or find employment depending on their environment, abilities, and the subjects they have studied. At least 7,000 students should continue their studies in schools next semester. Among these 7,000 students, in addition to a portion who temporarily drop out of school due to social, family, environmental, or personal abilities and courage, a portion transfer to other schools in the rear to study, and a portion may continue their studies in schools in the war zone, it is planned to temporarily count 3,000 who are waiting for the government to establish new schools to accommodate and provide relief. It is planned to request the Central Government to establish a national middle school in Zhejiang, and to allocate 1,500 Ningbo and Shaoxing students each to the temporary middle schools designated by Zhejiang Province to handle the relocation of faculty and staff from Shanghai. The former has not yet been approved by the Central Government, while the latter has been submitted by the Ministry of Education to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for the future location of the national middle school, it is planned to be located at the junction of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, with special funding from Jiangxi rice. The entire school will temporarily open 30 classes, in addition to high school and junior high school classes, vocational and normal school departments will also be set up when necessary. The temporary middle schools are planned to be located in Changshan, Kaihua in the Quzhou area, and Suian in the Yanzhou area, and branch schools are planned to be established in Jinyun, Yongkang, and other places based on actual needs, with a planned 53 classes (12 high school classes, 24 junior high school classes, 6 simple normal school classes, and 11 vocational classes), so that students from high school, junior high school, normal school, agriculture, industry, and commerce in Ningbo and Shaoxing will all have the opportunity to receive education.

### Yarn Flowers The Cotton Yarn Market Surge Becomes More Intense, Nearing the 1,600 Yuan Mark, Afternoon Gray Market Already Breaks 1,600 Yuan Mark, Major Change Imminent Without Mitigation Measures, Our Newspaper Responds to a Reader's Inquiry

The yarn market continues to rise, and the surge is intensifying. This is because Hong Kong merchants continue their relentless sales efforts. Today, another 1,755 bales were shipped there. In addition, there is a shortage of some 20-count yarns, and purchasing is inconvenient. Therefore, these merchants prefer to handle "Double Horse" brand yarns, which are readily available. As a result, transactions for "Double Horse" mill orders continue unabated. At the same time, raw material prices are rising daily. All these factors contribute to the stability of the yarn market. However, the amount of short selling is very large. Sellers, seeing the above situation, find it difficult to resist. "Double Horse" mill orders are gradually being reduced to within 20,000 bales. Secondly, demand from the South remains strong. The price of 1,585 yuan on May 3rd has already been surpassed. In this environment, short sellers have a weak line of defense and can only painfully cover their positions. The market then quickly rises. Market rumors abound, saying that a certain large trader went bankrupt, with short positions of about 4,000 bales or more, and is now in the same situation. However, they are fortunately in a better position. For the past six months, they have been making money on short positions, so their financial strength is quite strong, and they have sufficient backing. However, considering the current situation, they are adopting a "knowing when to adapt is the mark of a wise person" strategy and are taking the opportunity to switch from short to long, accumulating a quantity of 6,000 to 7,000 bales. The market is closed this afternoon due to the weekend, but some say that informal trading in the stock exchange building has already reached 1,620 yuan. In this situation, short sellers are panicking. In short, the recent rise in prices of both American and Indian cotton and the increase in raw material costs are a major blow to short sellers. The future of the yarn market is undergoing a transformation.

"Double Horse" opened this morning because it was heard that a certain yarn company had gone bankrupt late at night, freeing up about 4,000 bales. Therefore, many short sellers rushed to cover their positions. The opening price was 1,575 yuan, rising directly to 1,587 yuan, surpassing the high price of 1,585 yuan on the 3rd of last month. Then it was heard that the current yarn Hong Kong merchants still had a healthy appetite, and confidence was stronger, rising to 1,594 yuan. However, some came back to short sell, falling back to 1,577 yuan. Until after 12 o'clock, a certain large short seller significantly increased their long positions, rising again to 1,585 yuan at the close. The total trading volume for the half-day was 14,200 bales. The amounts bought by various merchant groups are listed on the left:

The market situation for "Golden Double Horse" brand yarn is trending upward, with active trading and short covering. As a result, the July contract rose by 5 yuan, and the August contract rose by 3.5 yuan. The trading volume was 8,000 bales. The high, low, and closing prices for the half-day are listed on the left:

Someone wrote to our newspaper, listing our cotton yarn news from the 12th to the 26th of this month, saying that it was "either promoting the long side or advocating for the short side, reversing fortunes and doing everything possible to manipulate the market. I truly don't know what journalistic ethics are, which is truly regrettable." The letter also stated that our newspaper "fabricates news, such as yesterday's (26th) report that the amount of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong in the past ten days was about 10,000 bales or more. If you check the price list in your newspaper from June 16th to June 27th, the number of spot yarn transactions listed each day that belong to Hong Kong merchants is only 3,510 bales, while those belonging to speculative transactions among peers reach as many as 24,630 bales. I also don't know what the value of the news is. At a time when prices are soaring and people are suffering, why continue to add fuel to the fire? I believe this is not something that you, sir, would be happy to do." The above is the main point of the letter writer's argument. Although they did not request a response in the newspaper, our newspaper has a fair stance and is never afraid of public opinion. We have our own stance on right and wrong, so we are willing to reveal it for the public to judge.

The editor hereby responds to the letter writer. Since you know that "news values objective reporting and should not be subjective propaganda," you should not rashly accuse us of this. Because there is a trend of rising prices in the market, we believe that prices will go up, which is not "promoting the long side." If there are signs of a decline in the market, we believe that prices will go down, which is not "advocating for the short side." We are completely "objectively" "reporting" and have never "subjectively" "propagandized." Only those engaged in cotton yarn speculation, who hope for prices to rise when they buy and hope for prices to fall when they sell, have subjective prejudices. Once there is a prejudice, any fair reporting or observation of the overall trend will be seen as wrong. What aligns with my intentions is considered right, and what goes against my intentions is considered wrong. Since right and wrong are not clear, their opinions on what is reasonable or not are not worth considering.

As for saying that the cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong is about 10,000 bales or more, and that according to the price list, the number of spot yarn transactions by Hong Kong merchants is only 3,500 bales, and therefore "I don't know what the value of the news is," this is truly blind and absurd. The editor does not need to blame himself, but rather blames the letter writer for reading the newspaper too carelessly and writing too hastily. You should know that according to our newspaper's on-site investigation, the amount of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong and other places is indeed about 10,000 bales. As for the details, there is no need to announce them. As long as the letter writer seeks them calmly, it will not be difficult to find them. If the facts are not clear, and you resort to scolding, even if you are too angry, you should not vent it on our newspaper. It would be fortunate if you could cultivate your temper.

### Cotton Market Continues to Rise

The spot cotton situation is extremely firm. Generally, those holding goods are unwilling to show samples. Everyone seems to be treating it as a national treasure. This is because the spot price of "Double Horse" brand yarn has suddenly increased significantly, and factories are unwilling to accept it. In addition, overseas cotton markets are rising daily. The price in Shanghai is relatively cheaper, so cotton merchants' goals are not being achieved, but they are unwilling to give up easily. Prices for both coarse and fine raw cotton have risen by another three to five yuan. The opening prices are listed on the left, totaling 1,514 bales, with prices rising by three to five yuan.

The New York cotton market rose due to purchases by speculators and Wall Street. At the same time, it was also boosted by the firm opposition of the parliament against maximum cotton cloth price limits. Yesterday's closing price was 27-28 points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to purchases by speculators, then fell slightly due to sales by European exporters. Finally, it actively rose again due to short covering. As a result, the closing prices rose by one to six rupees each. It is also predicted that today's opening market will be bullish by three to four rupees.

The order transactions for foreign cotton in Shanghai are firm and rising due to the further increase in prices of American and Indian cotton and the good situation of spot yarn. All parties are quite enthusiastic about purchasing. Yesterday, both Chinese and foreign cotton spinning mills purchased more than 1,000 bales of Brazilian cotton. At the same time, cotton brokers also had transactions in Indian cotton.

### Piece Goods Cotton Yarn Rises Sharply, Spot Cotton Cloth Rises Even Higher

Factory Cloth Yesterday's market continued the trend of rising prices. This was due to the sharp rise in speculative yarn and cloth prices, which aroused hoarding intentions. Demand for futures was also strong. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill cloth each rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt. Dyed cloth also rose by another 5 jiao per bolt. Trading on this street was particularly active, totaling more than 500 pieces. Of these, futures for twill velvet, French velvet, and corduroy accounted for half. Merchants from Guangdong and Guangxi purchased more than 100 pieces of blue cloth and khaki twill. Merchants from Siam and Singapore purchased more than 5,000 bolts of various bleached and dyed cloths. Today, 550 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth Yesterday, due to the soaring price of "Double Horse" brand yarn, people inside and outside the industry became more confident, and demand continued to be strong. Because the exchange's futures market had no trading volume, the spot market was only open for half a day on Saturday, but the surge was particularly strong. High-end fine cloth from the "Dragon Head" brand was sold for 49.4 yuan. The noon closing price was slightly lower at 49.05 yuan. Other mid- and low-end fine cloths each rose by 5 to 7.5 jiao. Colored cloth "Four Gentlemen" drill once rose to 1.62 yuan in the morning, and closed at 1.615 yuan. The spot bank orders opened at 1.5825 yuan. It is said that the consolidated tax will be increased starting next month, so spot demand from customers is expected to be strong.

### The US Exchange Rate May Increase and Lengthen, The Gold Market Reverses and Falls Back

Yesterday, the gold market in the gray market first rose slightly and then suddenly reversed and fell. The price once collapsed to within the 6,400 yuan mark. The hearts of all parties were stimulated by this wind and turned to fatigue. The equalization fund and American Fox advocated increasing and lengthening the Shanghai American exchange rate to 5.5 yuan, and there were rumors that the Soviet Union and Japan might have a war, so the foreign exchange rate hardened. In addition, the silver and gold banks sold and, at noon, sharply retreated from 6,435 yuan to 6,385 yuan. The securities firms' constant efforts to push it up raised it to outside 6,400 yuan, and it still squeezed a small 17 yuan. Half-day trading totaled more than 20,000 taels.

Yat Tai, Chick Tai, Seng Kee, and Lai made efforts to push it up and lingered at 6,430 yuan for a long time, once raising it to 6,435 yuan, and then only rising and falling by a few yuan. It was not until 10:45 that fatigue began to show. The foreign exchange rate reported easing, and unfavorable rumors also arose. Heng Kee, Hop Shing, Tak Tai, Ting Shing, and Yan Shing Wing successively sold forcefully, and floating longs were cut off, and the price gradually decreased by more than 40 yuan, falling into the inside of 6,400 yuan, seeing 6,385 yuan.

At noon, the market closed at 6,404 yuan, which was 17 yuan lower than the previous day.

### Suspension of Acceptance Business

Since its establishment in March 1936, the Bank Note Acceptance Institute of the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry in Shanghai has handled the acceptance of notes between colleagues, regulated finance, and its business has been relatively developed. Last year, the city's banking conditions were loose, and the acceptance business decreased accordingly. Recently, there has been an influx of idle funds, and acceptance matters have virtually stagnated. In order to reduce expenses, the institute decided to temporarily suspend the acceptance business and yesterday sent a circular to all member banks to abolish the acceptance agreement. All acceptance funds previously paid by the member banks to the institute will be returned before the end of this month.

### Food Hong Kong Rice Has a Huge Amount Waiting to Be Sold Speculation Is Difficult to Move, The Market Gradually Stabilizes Hong Kong Rice Arrived in Two Batches Yesterday, The Number Was Not Small

The Yang Rice Market Situation Still Has Mixed Ups and Downs, Forming a Circling Pattern. In the Early Market, Both Customers and Hoarders Were Weak, and Floating Longs Cashed in Profits. The Mainland Merchant Group Had Not Shipped Out Their Previous Orders, and New Transactions Were Waiting and Not Moving Forward. Since There Were Many Stocks and Arrivals, and the Publicly Sold Hong Kong Rice Also Had a Huge Amount Waiting to Be Sold, The Opening Price Immediately Moved Downstream. Both Futures and Spot Rice Once Fell Outside 1 Yuan to 2 Yuan. Then, Since The Price Was Small, It Attracted The Ningbo Merchant Group to Increase Purchases, and They Purchased No Less Than 5,000 Bags of Futures and Spot. The Street's Retail Investors Also Took Advantage of the Flat Price to Absorb. The Market Was Tired and Rebounded. However, The Overall Market Was Still Relatively Flat Throughout the Day. General Wind-Stirring People Couldn't Do the Work of Snatching Hats and Kicking the Ball. The Total Spot Transaction Was Only More Than 7,000 Bags. The British-Chinese Company Original Bags Were Also Only 500-600 Tons. As a Result, The Market Saw a Small Turn of About 1 Yuan. The British-Chinese Company Broken Rice Has Little Trading in Both Spot and Future, July From 115 Yuan to 114 Yuan, No. 2 Rice Previously Opened at 141-2 Yuan, Yesterday Only 140.05 Yuan and 140 Yuan, The Small Twist Spot Both 149 Yuan to 148.5 Yuan, No. 1 Saigon Also Hasn't Opened, Spot Prices All Sell Less Than 1 Yuan, The Closing Market Forms a Fixed Trend.

For Thick and Thin Geng Chinese Rice, The Supply and Demand Were Similar Yesterday. All Prices Kept Their Original Plates Without Honor or Disgrace. Guai Kai South Harbor Fresh Early and Late Rice Was 137 Yuan to 134 Yuan, Zhongguan Original Bag 135 Yuan, Wuxi Original Bag Overnight Geng Was 131 Yuan to 130 Yuan.

The Demand for Sticky Rice Turned Clear, and Transactions Were Particularly Sparse. Although Xiang Yuan White Had Limited Market Goods, The Selling Price Was Difficult to Support and Was Reduced by Nearly 1 Yuan. Kai Hong Kong Gao Yuan White Was 122.5 Yuan and 122 Yuan, Zhong Jue Was 117-8 Yuan, Nuo Lu Was 112.5 Yuan Jue to 106 Yuan. After The Price of Chinese Sticky Rice Was Thoroughly Depreciated, There Were Quite a Few Retailers Asking About It, and The Cargo Owners Were Unwilling to Lightly Dispose of It Again, So The Market Had No Change. Ordinary Goods Continued to Open at About 120 Yuan, But High-Priced Goods Still Needed 123-4 Yuan.

A Large Batch of Foreign Rice Arrived at the Port on Anshun Ship of Taikoo Company Yesterday Afternoon, With 28,792 Bags of Foreign Rice From Hong Kong. Among Them, 12,314 Bags Were Low-Priced Rice From the Public Works Department, and The Rest Were Passenger Goods.

The Company's Taiyuan Ship Has Also Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Evening, and Also Has Foreign Rice Loaded. The Exact Number Needs to Be Ascertained and Reported on Monday. (Zu)

### Foreign Vermicelli Arrives Continuously

The Current Foreign Vermicelli Market Situation, After Once Rising Slightly The Day Before Yesterday, Has Become More Uncertain. Recently, Goods Have Been Transferred From Hong Kong and Arrivals Have Been Continuous. The Two Reports of This Newspaper Reported 20,300 Bags of Bell Tower Flower and Bird Brands Newly Arrived on The Hanyang Ship, and They Are Being Unloaded. It Is Heard That The Taiyuan Ship Will Still Load 37,000 Bags in Early Next Week. Amidst The Sound of Continuous Arrivals, Hoarders Are Holding Back. But Future Orders Will Ultimately Be Unprofitable, and The Sale of Low-Priced Vermicelli Will Soon Stop, So People's Hearts Are Still Difficult to See Small. The Market Is Calmly Opening Jinlong Vermicelli at 32.25 Yuan to 2 Jiao, And Shuangying Vermicelli at 32.05 Yuan. The Asking Price for Bastion Vermicelli and Chain Tower Vermicelli Is 33 Yuan, But There Are No Buyers. The Market Is Still Brewing.

### Oil Cake Oil Cake Actual Sales Are Both Weak

Actual Sales of Cooking Oil Turned Slack and Weak Again, and People's Hearts Returned to Being Languid.

The Corn Market Was Flat After a Rise Yesterday. It Initially Rose More Than 0.5 Yuan Because the Hangzhou Merchant Group Continued to Purchase. Then The Hoarders Dao Gao Qun Xiang Came Out of the Cage and Low, and the Result Was Similar to the Previous Phase. A Total of More Than 2,000 Bags of Saigon and Helan Corn Were Sold (The Price Details Are in the Market Price ).

### Securities Long Public Bonds Cash in Profits

The Gray Market of Public Bonds First Rose and Then Fell Yesterday. On The One Hand, New Hoists Were Weak, And On The Other Hand, Old Longs Gradually Came Out of the Cage. The North Merchant Group Has Been Selling for Several Days. The General People in The Market All Say That the Long Side Coming Out Is to Rescue the Short Side so that They Can Hedge, and Otherwise They Will Have No Chance to Hedge. This Kind of Statement Is Completely a Chapter of Long Side, A Kind of Appearance of Strong Color and Internal Weakness, Which Is Invisibly Revealed. According to The Basic Mind of Doing Traders, They All Want to Profit. Yesterday's Market Turned Weak Because the Long Side Was Too Crowded, and Investors Couldn't Get One in a Hundred. So Once There Was a Little Shaking, They All Wanted to Find a Way to Escape. They Were Sincerely Afraid That a Large Number Would Come Out of the Cage, And the Short Side Would Take Advantage of It. Therefore, They Made This Clever Remark to Induce the Short Side's Hedge. The Long Side Then Gets to Sell and Profit. Moreover, Most of Them Are Now Spot Entries and Exits. Occasionally, There Are Those Who Borrow Goods to Deliver, But the Number Is Still a Small Number. Therefore, The Trend of Mu Bian Is Tired, Which Is Completely the Long Side Coming Out, Which Has Absolutely Nothing to Do With the Rumors. As in Yesterday's Market, Yitai First Raised the Price, And Type C Opened at 3.4 Yuan, And Tung Hong Sold Immediately. Hongda Also Came Out of the Cage, and The 3 Yuan Form Was Broken. New Hong and Xin Chang Came to Buy Again, And The North Merchant Group Suichang and Renfeng Came Out of the Cage Again. Therefore, The Market Was High and Low. Although the Long Side Wanted to Try Their Best to Hoist, They Couldn't Unite, So the Result Was Still Tired and Fell by 1-3 Jiao. The Transaction Was About 1 Million Yuan. The Simplified Table Is Listed Below.

The English Merchant Xue Nawang Rubber Co., Ltd., Managed by Huitong Foreign Bank, Is Scheduled to Hold the 21st Shareholders' Meeting on July 11th.

Therefore, the Silk Industry Has Reached A Dead End.

### Coal Bituminous Coal Sales Market Stagnant

### A Visit to You Sheng Rainproof Cloth Weaving and Manufacturing

— Zhou Zhifeng

Rainproof cloth is a new invention of recent years. It is a qualified material for making raincoats. Its quality is as light as Bevillein, and its price is much cheaper than imported goods. Since the year of Geng, its sales have become more popular and spread to various ports in Southeast Asia. There are three operators: "Shanghai Raincoat Factory", "China Underwear Company" and "You Sheng Textile Factory". However, China Underwear Company and Shanghai Raincoat Factory do not sell raw materials, but sell raincoats made in factories, while You Sheng Factory produces in large quantities and specializes in wholesale of current and fixed orders without retail sales. Most of the gold brand goods circulating in the market today, which are bought and sold by the merchants, are made by You Sheng. I am in the woolen cloth business and have dealings with the merchants. In order to maintain my own reputation, I always pay close attention to the quality of the wool and cotton goods I sell. Therefore, I also wanted to know the content of rainproof cloth, and I had the intention to visit the You Sheng Factory. A few days ago, I drove to No. 31, Jixifei Road, West Shanghai (the distribution office is located at No. 288, Yunnan Road) to visit the factory. Manager Chen Ji welcomed and instructed me, and I learned that there were 120-30 looms, two-thirds of which were specialized in weaving rainproof cloth, and one-third were weaving other cloths. For the weaving of rainproof cloth, the warp and weft are all made of domestic high-quality singed yarn, and are woven with a special organization. After the raw materials enter the factory, they are first subjected to tensile tests and stem inspections, and then sent to the preparation room. After the preparation process of warping and wefting, they can be put on the machine for weaving. Because of the firmness and weight of the rainproof cloth, ordinary cloth machines cannot handle it, so the factory has special heavy-duty machines for weaving. (To be continued)

### German Purchases Stored in Shanghai: Rumors of Imminent Price Cuts; Value Exceeds US$1 Million; Positive Impact Expected on Local Economy

Sources here predict that, following the outbreak of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, the large quantities of food and goods purchased and stored by German exporters in Shanghai, unable to be transported to Germany via the Trans-Siberian Railway as planned, must be disposed of. Therefore, prices are expected to plummet soon.

Urgent Need for Raw Materials and Food

Local business circles claim that, before the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, German interests commissioned Japanese and other neutral firms to make large-scale purchases in the East. Germany's need for raw materials and food has become increasingly urgent due to the continuation of the war. Therefore, German merchants are doing everything possible to acquire materials in Shanghai or Japan, with the intention of shipping them to Germany via Vladivostok using the Trans-Siberian Railway.

Immense Quantities of Goods Stockpiled in Shanghai

Reliable sources indicate that the goods purchased by German interests include coconut oil, tin, copper, rice, flour, nitrates, and tungsten, all stockpiled in Shanghai and unable to be shipped out. Regarding food, German interests have commissioned Japanese firms to purchase large quantities of Java sugar, which are currently stored in warehouses throughout the city. While German business circles often publicly boast that the large quantities of goods they have stored will not depreciate in value due to their inability to be transported to Germany, various parties believe that the prices of various materials stored by the Germans in Shanghai will fall sharply within a few weeks, and ultimately they will have to be sold off at reduced prices.

It is rumored that the recent decline in sugar prices in Shanghai is largely due to the large quantities of sugar stored by German interests, which have now begun to consider selling off at reduced prices. Well-informed sources say that if the Soviet-German war continues for a long period, German business circles will change their current optimism and decide to sell off their inventories as much as possible, which will inevitably lower prices. This will have a beneficial impact on the local economy, as the "dumping" of goods by German merchants will reduce prices, and the prices of other goods may also fall accordingly.

Agents Profited Handsomely

With the Siberian Railway, the only safe route for Shanghai-based German exporters to transport goods to Germany, now cut off, German trade and Germany's domestic economy have both suffered a major blow. The goods purchased here by German interests are considerable, and German merchants are eager to purchase the items they need, even if it means paying prices far higher than the market price. Therefore, local Chinese, Japanese, and neutral exporters have profited handsomely from acting as agents for Germany in purchasing goods. Some estimate that the goods currently stockpiled by German interests in Shanghai are worth more than US$1 million, while others estimate a far greater amount. The exact number is not yet available.

Shortage of German Goods; Market Prices Continue to Rise

Another repercussion of the Soviet-German war is that German firms, knowing that German products can no longer be shipped to Far Eastern markets, have raised the retail and wholesale prices of German goods such as pharmaceuticals, paints, dyes, machinery, and scientific instruments. Over the past several years, German goods have been sold widely in various ports and inland areas of China. In recent months, due to a shortage of ships sailing to the Far East, it has been difficult for China to obtain American machinery, so large quantities of machinery were purchased from Germany. Now the situation has changed, and in the coming days, the market prices of German goods in Shanghai will inevitably continue to rise to new highs.

### German and Italian Women and Children in the Dutch East Indies to be Evacuated to Japan; Asama Maru to Pass Through Shanghai on the 9th of Next Month; German and Italian Adult Males Detained by the Dutch East Indies

The Japanese mail ship Asama Maru, chartered by the German government, carrying 400 German and Italian women and children evacuees, is sailing from Batavia, Dutch East Indies, to Kobe and is scheduled to pass through Shanghai on July 9. The Shanghai office of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) received notification yesterday morning (the 28th) that the ship would call at Shanghai. It is reported that the majority of the women and children on board the Asama Maru are German, with the remainder being Italian. Their husbands and sons of military age have been detained by the authorities in the Dutch East Indies.

All Will Disembark After Arriving in Shanghai

When the Asama Maru arrives in Shanghai, most of the German and Italian women and children will disembark. Only those with relatives and friends in Japan will continue to Kobe. It is not known whether the travel expenses of these women and children will be paid by themselves or by the German government. NYK officials also do not know what class of cabins they are traveling in. According to an official from the company, it is not yet certain whether tickets can be purchased in Shanghai to travel to Kobe on the Asama Maru and is awaiting notification. If tickets can be purchased, passengers arriving in Shanghai on the Asama Maru will transfer to the Tatsuta Maru to go to Japan. The Asama Maru was originally scheduled to pass through Shanghai on July 5 on its regular voyage to the United States, but it was suddenly announced that it would sail empty from Manila to Batavia to transport German and Italian women and children there.

### Tram Fare Increases Postponed

The British-owned tram company of the Public Concession, using the excuse of foreign exchange tightening, disregarded the burden on the city's residents and obtained approval to increase fares again. Upon hearing the news, various parties expressed deep indignation. Due to public opinion pressure, the newly set prices, originally scheduled to take effect yesterday, have now been postponed. According to a notice issued yesterday by the company's manager, Mr. Ewen, the date of implementation of the new fare schedule will be announced later. The increase in monthly tickets is also still pending. In addition, the Shanghai Chinese Bus Company's request to increase fares is also still under consideration by the Municipal Council. Various parties hope that the authorities will handle it carefully and not easily approve it.

### Ningbo Plague Spreads to Jiangxi Province

After the plague in Ningbo recurred, it has not been completely eradicated. It is now known that cases have also been discovered in Guangze, Jiangxi Province. Fortunately, the local authorities have made every effort to prevent and control it, and it has not spread. In order to actively eliminate the plague atmosphere, the Central Health Administration recently selected several experts to go to Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces to cooperate with the local authorities in prevention and control, and brought a large number of drugs to set up epidemic prevention institutions in various regions and intensify work.

### Fox Consults Shanghai on Financial Measures; Refuses to Announce Established Equalization Policy

After arriving in Shanghai from Chongqing, Mr. Fox, the American member of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, and his assistant, Mr. Taylor, held meetings with the managers of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and HSBC, Citibank, and other banks, as well as various economic experts, to review the financial and monetary systems of Shanghai and the occupied areas, and the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai. The two gentlemen continued yesterday to have close discussions with the responsible persons of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and HSBC, and economic experts. They will prepare a detailed report based on their findings, with attached opinions, and submit it to the Equalization Fund Committee as a reference for determining fundamental policies. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday that although Mr. Fox's decision to come to Shanghai was to repeatedly discuss with the banking community, it was only in the nature of consulting and seeking opinions, and he himself refused to announce the established policy of the Equalization Fund. The only thing that can be said is that the legal exchange rate will be maintained at all times to consolidate currency confidence and benefit the legitimate trade of Chinese and foreign merchants throughout the country. Currently, the Equalization Fund allows importers to apply for foreign exchange at the official rate for import goods that are necessary for China's domestic needs, and does not allow them to apply for foreign exchange at the legal rate for goods transported to occupied areas, regardless of whether they are necessary or not. Although the Shanghai black market foreign exchange will continue to be maintained, goods transported to Shanghai may not apply for foreign exchange at the legal rate. As for the Equalization Fund's existing US$50 million in American loans to China, £5 million in British loans to China, and US$20 million in joint loans from Chinese national banks, it is exceptionally well-funded. Since Mr. Fox arrived in Shanghai, the exchange rates of the British pound and the US dollar in the Shanghai foreign exchange market have eased yesterday, and Japanese banks and speculators have successively sold off, and the value of the legal currency has invisibly increased.

### Flour Sales at Fixed Prices to be Discontinued Next Month; Comes to an End on July 2nd

In order to regulate the people's food supply and suppress flour prices, the Municipal Council previously obtained the consent of the Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills to hold flour sales at fixed prices from February of last year. At the end of November last year, it again requested each foreign flour import firm to request their designated customers to submit one-tenth of their orders for flour to be sold at fixed prices by the flour companies. The details of the process have been successively reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the 300,000 bags of flour at fixed prices that Fuxin Mill agreed to supply, as well as the foreign flour that has been drawn in recently, have been sold out since May 1 and will be sold out by June 26. Subsequently, the factory generously agreed to continue to supply 33,272 bags, so the flour sales at fixed prices could be extended to July 1 (flour will be issued as usual on July 1). It is now found that the total amount of foreign flour in stock in this city is more than 1 million bags. If it is not exported, it should be able to meet the needs of this port until the end of the year. Moreover, the rice market has become stable, and it is expected that there will be no drastic changes in the flour market thereafter. Therefore, the flour sales at fixed prices will come to an end on July 2. The Fuxin and Fufeng factories' supply of flour at fixed prices is a contribution to society and is worthy of admiration. The flour companies' enthusiastic sales, the foreign flour import firms and designated customers, and the Municipal Council's enthusiastic cooperation in stabilizing the flour market are also commendable. As for the Fair Price Foreign Flour Committee's handling of the distribution of fair price foreign flour for half a year, it is said that the authorities have decided to have Chinese and foreign accountants Xu Yongzuo and Tang Sheng check the accounts before formally announcing them.

### The Commercial Press Resumes Operations Slightly Later

The Commercial Press, which had been on strike for more than two months, has been resolved after Ms. Xing De of the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council mediated again and both parties made concessions. The company is actively adjusting internally and was originally scheduled to resume operations on July 1. According to insiders, the reorganization has not been completed and the resumption of operations on the 1st may not be possible. However, with active reorganization, the day should not be too far off.

### American Members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Advocate Expanding Strength; Express Deep Concern About Security in the Concession; Urge All American Residents in the City to Undergo Training Immediately

A member of a certain company of the American contingent of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps sent a letter to all American residents in the city yesterday, asking them to join the American contingent immediately and strengthen the strength of the team. The letter briefly described the history of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in order to urge American residents in Shanghai to pay attention to preserving the strength of the team. The letter expressed concern about the current strength of maintaining security in the concession, because the letter stated, "If the American contingent and other national teams are disbanded one day, American businessmen must rely on the city's police, then what will be the result?" Therefore, the letter called on American residents to join the American contingent immediately to receive "training in maintaining security, cracking down on all remote husband's actions, and mastering street fighting skills."

### Mr. and Mrs. Carter Depart Shanghai; Charity Groups Give Farewell Reception; Great Contribution to Supporting Relief Efforts; Residents Feel the Loss at Imminent Departure

Dr. Baker, Director-General of the International Red Cross and Director of the American Red Cross, left Shanghai in January of this year, and Mr. Carter was hired by the American Red Cross to succeed him. Now that Mr. P. Carter, Chairman of the China Relief Committee of the American Red Cross, and Mr. Carter, Vice-Chairman, are both leaving Shanghai to return to the United States, 37 local charity groups held a special tea party at the International Hotel yesterday afternoon.

Tea Party Farewell

Guo Chengen of the Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Villagers Relief Association presided over the event, and Li Baiqiang and Li Guangcheng, Secretaries of the International Red Cross, hosted the event. More than 100 Chinese and Western guests attended, including representatives from various groups, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Ming Sisui, Du Da, Wei Yanfang, Li Guiyong, Zhao Jinqing, Li Baiqiang, Li Guangcheng, and the American Assessor General Hemmerick. In addition to the Chairman's address, Powell, the editor of the Miller's Review, and others spoke about the achievements of the American Red Cross in supporting relief efforts in China. Chairman Carter and Vice-Chairman Carter then gave thank-you speeches, and finally the Chairman, on behalf of the various groups, presented gifts as a farewell souvenir. It is understood that Mr. Carter will first take the President Pierce to return to the United States on the 5th of next month, and Mr. Carter will return in August after the successor Mr. Anderson arrives in Shanghai. Now the

Brief Biographies of the Two Gentlemen

are outlined below. Captain P. Carter, a native of Missouri, USA, studied at the University of Missouri and graduated from Washington University with a Bachelor of Laws. He came to China in 1906 and served as the first judge of the US Court for China. In 1910, he resigned as a judge and lived in Mexico City for three years. In 1913, he returned to China and served as the legal representative of the British-American Tobacco Company (now renamed Yizhong Tobacco Company), and was later elected as a director. During World War I, Mr. Carter joined the army and was stationed in Tianjin. After the war, he resigned and was awarded the rank of Captain. Mr. Carter is very enthusiastic about local public welfare undertakings and often engages in them bravely and without reservation. He can be called a leader among Westerners in the Far East. Mr. Carter is currently the Chairman of the China Relief Committee of the American Red Cross and the Chairman of the American China Disaster Advisory Committee, and is responsible for distributing relief funds, rice, wheat, milk powder, medicines, etc., in huge amounts. Since the Shanghai War, although transportation has been blocked due to the extraordinary period, the relief work for refugees throughout China has still been able to proceed. The value of the relief funds and supplies distributed is several million yuan, so that countless refugees in various places are not displaced due to the war, benefiting the refugees greatly.

Mr. Carter was born in San Francisco, California, USA. He arrived in Shanghai on January 1, 1924 and served as the General Secretary of the US Army and Navy YMCA in China. In 1938, the American Red Cross allocated 1 million yuan worth of relief supplies to the US Ambassador to China to handle relief for Chinese refugees affected by the war. Mr. Carter was elected as the Secretary. In 1940, the China Relief Committee of the American Red Cross was established. At this time, Mr. Carter was preparing to return to the United States. The committee persuaded him to stay and serve as Deputy Director-General for a period of six months. Later, due to the matter, the deadline was extended for another half a year. Recently, because the headquarters of the American YMCA urged him, he had to leave. The successor, Mr. P.W. Anderson, has already left for China.

### US Consulate Prepares to Celebrate US National Day; Program Not Yet Scheduled

July 4 (Friday) is the 152nd anniversary of the founding of the United States. The American community in this port believes that democratic countries are now jointly resisting aggression, and the preservation and promotion of the spirit of freedom, equality, and fraternity depend on the victory of this determined democratic group of countries. Therefore, the significance of this year's US Independence Day is even more worthy of commemoration. According to Mr. Standen, Consul of the US Consulate General, the report that the American community in Shanghai will celebrate the founding anniversary and that the US Consul General Rockhill will broadcast a speech has not yet been finalized. It is likely that the Consul General will deliver a simple speech when raising a glass to bless the motherland and President Roosevelt. Subsequently, US Consul General Rockhill said that the commemoration program has not yet been formally scheduled and will not be finalized until next Wednesday. The reports are all speculations. Mr. P. Carter, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the American Red Cross, and Director Carter have been in charge of disaster relief and have distributed millions of yuan worth of US-transported relief supplies to China. Now, by order of the General Assembly, they are being transferred from Shanghai. Thirty-seven charity groups in Shanghai specially held a banquet at the International Hotel yesterday to bid farewell (to express their thoughts of departure.

### American Cargo Ships Arrive in Shanghai One After Another; Maintaining Transpacific Shipping; New Freighter Frazer Arrives This Morning; Three Other Ships Also Carry Large Quantities of Goods

In order to thoroughly maintain transpacific shipping and prevent it from being interrupted, the US Maritime Commission has specially dispatched the freighter Frazier from Seattle, carrying 3,000 tons of goods such as flour and kerosene to Shanghai. The ship could have arrived here at noon yesterday, but due to the route, weather, etc., it will be delayed until this morning to arrive in Shanghai and berth at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf. The ship has a deadweight of 6,751 tons, a volume of 8,500 tons, and a sea mile speed of 14 sea miles per hour. This is still her maiden voyage to Shanghai. After berthing in Shanghai for two days, she will go to Hong Kong and Manila to return to the United States. After that, she will take turns with her sister ship, the Arialva, to come to Shanghai every month, managed by the Forbes & Co. In addition, the Langenbeck, agent of the American President Lines, arrived in Shanghai from New York yesterday at 11:30 a.m. The Deberq and West Huei, two freighters of the same company, with a deadweight of 3,703 tons, will arrive here successively from New York via the Panama Canal and Hong Kong today and tomorrow, each carrying a large number of American goods. Therefore, the freight transport between Shanghai and the United States will continue to come as usual in the future.

### Sale Price of Fixed Price Rice; Time Limit Extended

According to sources, the first batch of 27,115 bags of public warehouse rice, which arrived in Shanghai on July 2, has been decided by the Public Warehouse Committee to be handed over to the Municipal Council in its entirety, and sold to food households at a price of 110 yuan per picul, in accordance with the method of selling Hong Kong rice. It is understood that the Municipal Council intended to slightly increase the price of foreign rice when selling the Mindang rice in the second phase after the first phase of 280,000 bags was sold out, because the rice quality was better. However, now that 80,000 bags of public warehouse rice have been added, it has been decided to extend the fixed price of 110 yuan per picul. According to general estimates, the Municipal Council's first phase of foreign rice still has 100,000 bags available for sale by the rice shops. Now, with the addition of 80,000 bags of public warehouse rice, it will be enough to supply the city's rice shops for more than a month. It is evident that the people's food supply in this city will become more stable.

His family managed to sell the house and land for 18,000 yuan in legal tender and handed it over to the bandits' den, but the bandits still refused to release him. Li Kaiwen was then moved to a certain number in Jinjia Lane on Jisi Fei'er Road. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Li Kaiwen escaped while the kidnappers were asleep.

### Chinese Artillery Destroyed Three Japanese Aircraft; Japanese Navy Spokesman Officially Acknowledges

The Mainland News reported that the Japanese Navy spokesman said when hosting reporters yesterday (the 27th) that three days ago, the Chinese artillery bombarded the Yichang Japanese Navy Airfield, destroying three Japanese fighter planes on the airfield. He could not explain how the Chinese artillery approached the Yichang airfield. It is estimated that the artillery bombarded from across the Yangtze River, because the opposite bank of the Yangtze River is still in the hands of the Chinese army.

### Silver and Money Preparation Bank to Stop Interest on Checking Accounts Starting the Day After Tomorrow; Limited Transfer to Bund Bank; Handling Fee for Exceeding Limit Causes Great Loss

The Silver and Money Industries Joint Preparation aims to stabilize finance, adjust various interest rates, and adjust the supply and demand of remittances and checking account chips, so that cash remittances and checking accounts can be used equally, and illegal transactions of discounts and premiums in the market can be stopped. Those who want to speculate for profit by the high and low interest rates are no longer possible.

Adjusting Interest Rates

The Bank Joint Preparatory Committee recently stated that due to the concentration of floating funds in the Shanghai market, the savings deposits of clearing house accounts of various banks and firms collected by the committee have been increasing day by day, and the handling of counting money has become increasingly busy. Moreover, the deposits transferred by the committee to the banks on the Bund have a fixed amount, and an extra handling fee must be charged for the excess, which causes great losses in interest. Therefore, in order to reduce the burden, it has sent letters to various banks and firms, stating that starting from July 1, no interest will be calculated on all interbank checking account savings deposits. Restrictions will be placed on the exchange of bank deposits, and no interest will be calculated on amounts exceeding the fixed amount. The deposit interest on interbank remittances will also be adjusted, reducing it to three points per thousand yuan per day. At the same time, the lending rate in the money market has recently been reduced to three points per day.

Adjusting Chips

The chips circulating in the Shanghai market are cash remittances and checking accounts. Because remittances could not be cashed, it caused the so-called remittance discount. Since the remittance system was improved and became a new chip with a solid guarantee, remittances have changed from a discount to a premium. Now, in order to eliminate the plan, the silver and money industries immediately took remedial measures, that is, it is stipulated that if various banks and firms need remittances, they can level them with checking accounts to the Bank Joint Preparatory Committee at any time. At the same time, the four banks of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank will provide as much cash as possible to the legitimate cash needs of various industries, so that cash remittances and checking accounts can be used equally, and there must be no discrimination, eliminating the bad examples of checking accounts being more expensive than cash and remittance discounts and premiums.

The work in the outpatient department is busy, with 2,018 more visits than in April, and 1,272 more visits than in May of last year. This increase in workload can also be seen in the surgical cases in the outpatient department, with surgical cases being the highest for the month of May in nearly three years. The work in the X-ray department also continues to increase, with May of this year being the highest when compared to the same month in 1939 and 1940.

### Extorting Protection Money from Movie Theaters: Gang of Extortionists Cracked; Investigation in Pudong Conducted with Japanese Military; Receipts Confiscated and Detention Ordered

Since May of this year, movie theaters of all sizes in the British and French concessions of this city have suddenly received threatening letters, signed by Yao Qin, head of the Tie Qing Troupe, and bearing the official seal of the Tie Qing Troupe headquarters, demanding so-called protection money, ranging from 100 to 500 yuan per month, depending on the size of the theater, specifying the amount, and setting a deadline for sending someone to Gao Miao Jinjia Bridge in Pudong to

Negotiate Payment

Otherwise, they would resort to considerable measures to retaliate. After receiving the letters, some theaters paid, while others ignored them. The Xin Guang Theater was once attacked with smoke bombs by these fellows, and the Da Shanghai Theater was attacked twice. The Guang Hua Theater on Avenue Edward VII and the Xi Hai Theater on Xin Zha Road also received similar extortion letters on June 14, instructing them to pay in Pudong the next day. This was reported to the New Concession Police, who dispatched Chinese detectives Yang Feizhang, Ruan Yao, Ma Zhongrong, Wang Shilian, etc., together with personnel from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, to

Cross the River on Time

They hired rickshaws to Jinjia Bridge. At that time, a Ningbo native, Ye Jinbao (also known as Jiang Ya Zi, 18 years old), came forward and spoke with the detectives, instructing them to hand over the money. Shortly thereafter, Zhang Ren from Tongzhou and Wang Guilin from Pudong (only 14 years old) arrived and took the beer and cigarettes carried by the detectives. They were all arrested together. Then, they went to Ye Jinbao's home at No. 44, Lane 303, Qi Pu Road, and confiscated four official seals of the Tie Qing Troupe and the seal of the head, Yao Qin, as well as multiple receipts. All were

Taken Back to the Police Station

They confessed that the mastermind of the case was Xiang Erzhong, who was at large. Detention was ordered. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the Special Court No. 1. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case, stating that the defendants had committed many crimes and requesting a postponement. After questioning by Judge Shi, it was ruled that Ye, Zhang, and Wang would be detained pending further investigation and questioning.

### Incessant Heavy Rains Cause Tragedy in Nanshi; House Collapse Kills More Than Ten People; Pacific Typhoon Approaching

The Xujiahui Observatory has learned that the entire climate in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, has been controlled by the plum rain season. The weather in Shanghai will also not clear up for the time being. The temperature this morning also dropped sharply, reaching only 72 degrees at 5:00 AM.

Tragedy in Nanshi

Due to the continuous heavy rains, the accumulated water on various low-lying roads has not yet receded. In particular, the waterlogging in western Shanghai and Zhabei is still knee-deep. It is reported that five or six bungalows at the entrance of Jinjiafang, Zhao Fang Lane, in Nanshi, were eroded by rainwater during the heavy rain the day before yesterday and suddenly collapsed. This happened in the middle of the night, resulting in more than ten people being crushed to death and more than twenty people injured.

Traffic in the Western District

According to a notice issued yesterday by the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, all buses running in the western district will resume service starting this morning. Only Route 2 was running in the area yesterday. Starting this morning, Route 1 and Route 14 will also join.

### Falsely Established Company Defrauds for Profit; Main Culprit at Large, Apprentice Arrested

The Run Kang Yong Cotton Yarn Company, located in Room 354, 5th Floor, Securities Building, Jiujiang Road, was established by Qi Zhaokang and Qi Zhaoji with pooled funds. Since its opening, it has been in operation for less than a few months, and business has been slow. Zhao Bingyan, Qi Yongkang, and Lu Junfu, who are engaged in the cotton yarn business, purchased three batches of cotton yarn from Run Kang Yong on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, totaling: (1) 60 bales, for a price of 93,495 yuan; (2) 20 bales, for a price of 31,105 yuan; (3) 10 bales, for a price of 15,532.5 yuan. At the time, they paid three checks from the Qianzhuang and requested warehouse receipts, but were told to wait two hours to pick them up and were given three temporary receipts. When they went to pick up the warehouse receipts two hours later, only one apprentice was left in the company. The company owners, Qi Yongkang and others, had absconded with the money. At that time, lawyer Qian Shusheng, representing the company, announced liquidation. Realizing that they had been deceived, they reported to the Old Concession Police, who dispatched Chinese Deputy Detective Tao Gengrong and Detective Xu Wenbin to investigate. Because Song Yongfu (19 years old), an apprentice from Ningbo at the company, had secretly communicated with Qi Yongkang and others, he was arrested at midnight and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Division of the Special Court No. 1. Police lawyer Fang Fushu stated the facts of the case, requesting a postponement. After questioning by Judge Yu, it was ruled that Song Yongfu would be detained pending further investigation and verification.

### Case of Performing Obscene Songs and Dances; Summoning of Hotel Owner

The Shanghai New Hotel at 579 Jiujiang Road rents its downstairs hall to the Xin Le Palace Theater. However, the theater specializes in performing various obscene and indecent plays, using the naked performances of entire young girls as a gimmick, which is extremely demoralizing. Other theaters, such as the Wan Shang Tea House on Wu Ma Road, as well as the Da Luo Tian and Times Theater, have followed suit, performing similar plays. In order to rectify social customs, the Public Concession authorities went to the Xin Le Palace on the 16th of the month and arrested five young girls who were performing naked, and sent them to the Special Court No. 1 for separate punishment. Because Xu Mengyuan, the Ningbo owner of the Shanghai New Hotel, also violated Article 231 of the Criminal Code, the police requested the Special Court to issue a summons. Xu Mengyuan was ordered to appear in court yesterday morning, but he refused to comply. Police lawyer Fang Fushu stated the facts of the case, requesting a postponement. Judge Dai ruled that the case would be postponed pending further summons of the defendant for investigation.

### Several Tasks to Do During Vacation

— Wan

Children, when you see this topic, you must feel very strange. Why do we still have to work during summer vacation? Why does the school give us summer vacation? It's for us to rest, right? Yes, schools give summer vacation to students to let their bodies rest. But children, don't get it wrong. The meaning of vacation is not for children to just eat and do nothing all day and become lazy bugs, nor do they want you to be muddle-headed bugs wandering around all day. Its original intention is to adjust the serious school life so that in the active and free family life, you can still make reasonable progress in body and knowledge.

I have said that family life is free, active, and trivial. There is no teacher to teach, only parents to supervise. Because of the affection between parents and children, it is not as serious as a teacher. The quality of the results during the vacation depends on how much each child automatically works. From observing the lives of children in past vacations, some indulge in playing, their bodies become thin, and even in the first few weeks of school, they have no mood to study. Some children still work regularly under active living conditions. They sometimes read, sometimes work, and spend their time very well. At the end of the vacation, their grades are not bad after all. At work, their bodies and knowledge have made significant progress.

Children? We know that work can make our bodies stronger, increase our knowledge, and also get great joy and rich experience, and the rest after work is the most needed and the most comfortable. The scope of work is very wide, and there are many types. Now, I will list the work suitable for vacation below, hoping that children? can use them as you wish and apply them.

1. Read more books and newspapers: Regarding books, choose beneficial children's books, and reject all serial cartoons that are immoral and corrupting. When reading, in addition to understanding the content, you should also study the structure and pay attention to good sentences and difficult sentences. As for newspapers, they are spiritual food, and you must read them every day. Moreover, in this era of unpredictable international events, we cannot afford not to read them to broaden our horizons.

2. Clean the house: During this summer season, we must keep our homes clean to avoid the spread of diseases. Children should urge their families to pay attention and help with brushing and sweeping, or have a major cleaning once a week. On the one hand, develop a habit of labor, and on the other hand, reduce diseases.

3. Teach people to read: Among your family members or neighbors, if they like to read but don't have the opportunity, then you can use this long vacation to teach them to read, or tell meaningful stories to improve their character and explain the pain of not being able to read.

4. Group meetings: Gather a few like-minded classmates, sisters, or brothers, and hold a meeting once a week to discuss difficult problems, go out for a trip together, study current affairs, or have legitimate entertainment, so as to connect feelings and get more knowledge.

5. Review arts books: Review the books you have read at any time to avoid forgetting them and not let down the hard work we put in at the time.

The above points are my general opinions. If children have more valuable work, they can go ahead and implement them. In short, every child should not let the precious vacation pass by in laziness and idleness. Finally, I hope that children's bodies and knowledge will advance in both aspects during the vacation.

### The Plum Rain Season

— Jin Zhen

It rained for a day and a night in a row, and the low-lying roads suddenly accumulated water. Even the lane where Ah Hui's family lived was inevitably submerged in mud and water, turning into a small river. A different kind of water scene was reflected in Ah Hui's eyes, making him feel strangely interesting. Fortunately, his school had been on summer vacation since the day before yesterday, so he was not affected by this water accumulation. However, his father was heavily "fleeced" by rickshaw pullers for errands. Just a short stretch of road that could be seen was priced at four or five jiao, and there was no room for negotiation. This kind of business could be done, and if those hoarders and profiteers heard about it, they would be very envious.

With such a large amount of rain falling and the temperature not dropping, the plum rain season has formed. Ah Hui feels very hot and uncomfortable all over, as if he is being steamed.

"The sunlight in the plum rain season is very strong, the air is humid, and the climate is hot. This kind of hot and humid air can increase the temperature of our skin and slow down the circulation of blood. But when blood circulation slows down, it cannot get enough oxygen to supply the brain and other parts of the body, so we feel very uncomfortable. This phenomenon is exactly the opposite of the warm season of spring, so we all like spring and hate this plum rain weather. You should know that the plum rain season does not exist in the whole world, but is unique to our country and Japan. It probably starts when the plums turn yellow, which is in the middle of the fifth lunar month, but this year's plum rain is a bit late, so it is also called "late plum rain." The plum rain season lasts for about a month, and the weather is very depressing. So why does it happen? In June of the Gregorian calendar, when the sun shines directly on the Yangtze River basin of our country, a low-pressure area occurs, but it does not stop in one place, but slowly advances eastward. If a low-pressure area occurs, it will rain. When the low-pressure area is moving eastward, it turns out that the high-pressure area in the northern Pacific Ocean is also very developed. Once there is a high-pressure area, the sky will become clear, but the high-pressure area just stops the advance of the low-pressure area, but the low-pressure area cannot defeat the high-pressure area, so it shrinks back and has to stay in the Yangtze River basin area, so every day it is covered with dark clouds and the sunlight cannot be seen, and the temperature is very high and the air is humid. This is the plum rain season." Ah Ming answered such a long passage, thinking that his brother would not ask any more questions.

"Brother, why does the lane accumulate water?" Ah Hui still asked endlessly, which was really beyond Ah Ming's expectations.

"Of course, it's because the terrain of the lane is too low, because water likes to flow to low places. Think about it, with such heavy rain, plus the large tide in the Huangpu River, the rainwater cannot all flow into the Huangpu River, and the water from the Huangpu River flows back from the sewers, so the water gathers in low places." Ah Ming said here, and finally stopped Ah Hui's questions."

### The Story of Fluorescent Lamps

— Sun Linchang

In the countryside, you can see fireflies on summer nights. Their tails emit a faint glow. Children like to catch them and put them in glass bottles to play with, which is quite interesting.

Regarding the origin of fireflies, the ancients had a misunderstanding and believed that they were transformed from decaying grass. For example, the Monthly Orders says: "Decaying grass transforms into fireflies." The Erya also says: "Decaying grass gets the heat and humidity and becomes fireflies." This is of course due to a lack of understanding of biology.

Although the firefly is small, its heart is bright. It lives by the water and grass and has its own light, not assimilated by the dark night, and not damaged by wind and rain. In the dark universe, it comes and goes alone and acts according to its nature. It can be said to be the "outstanding" of insects!

Since the Shanghai Electric Power Company issued a call for the city to save electricity due to the lack of fuel sources, how to save electricity has been a concern for all Shanghai residents. As a result, "fluorescent lamps" have recently appeared, coming all the way from the United States.

Speaking of "fluorescent lamps," there was a legend in ancient China that firefly cages were used instead of lamps to illuminate ferry passengers. However, the "fluorescent lamps" made by major companies in Nanjing Road today are based on scientific principles and emit light by electricity, without any real fireflies inside. However, the shape and color are somewhat like fireflies. Only the ancient "fluorescent lamps" were truly worthy of the name. According to the Book of Jin, "At that time, there was a man named Che Yin, who was young and eager to learn and studied day and night without stopping. But because his family was poor, he often had no lamp oil, so he made a gauze bag and filled it with fireflies to light his reading." This is a good story of a wise man studying hard in poverty, and it is also the origin of saving lamp oil and inventing "fluorescent lamps."

### Before Dawn

— Xiao Wen

There was a very large rice weevil with a peculiar temperament. It felt that it was boring to stay in the rice jar all day and wanted to fly into the sky to play and see things that its kind had never had the pleasure of seeing. But because it had no wings, it could not realize its ideal. However, its heart did not die because of this, but became even more enthusiastic. Since it could not fly by itself, it had to ask Mr. Pheasant to help it achieve its dream. Although Mr. Pheasant was originally unwilling, he could not resist its sincerity of "three kneelings and nine kowtows" and could only agree.

Mr. Pheasant asked Mrs. Pheasant to take a piece of silk cloth and instructed the rice weevil to say, "You must use all your strength to bite this rope and never let go, and you must never say a word! Remember!" The rice weevil, in order to feast its eyes, of course agreed to everything.

So the pheasant couple used their mouths to hold both ends of the hemp thread and quickly flew into the high sky, crossed rivers, flew over forests, and crossed mountains, and later arrived at the plain. It saw green water, red flowers, green grass, gray soil…

A person saw this strange sight and shouted loudly, "Come and see! Come and see! A rice weevil and two pheasants are flying in the sky together!" "Where? Where?" everyone asked in surprise. "There, there, there!" he replied. People all gave up their work to see this wonder of the world - the rice weevil flying into the sky. "Ah! What a happy rice weevil!" someone exclaimed.

The rice weevil was very happy to see so many people watching it and felt infinitely glorious. Later, when it heard someone calling it a happy rice weevil, it was even happier and forgot that it was a wingless parasite.

"Haha!" It laughed triumphantly. "I have finally become..." Before it could finish speaking, its body suddenly fell and landed on the ground, becoming a pile of mush.

The pheasant couple also flew down, snatched its corpse, and kept it for a delicious breakfast tomorrow.

Dawn: The rooster crows, the pheasant enjoys the rights, and the rice weevil can no longer fly. Disclaimer: The manuscript "Wishing You a Bright Future" last Sunday was written by Mr. Yang Chunlu. The signature was omitted. This is to state.

### Eagle Pen Holder

— Zhang Huang

Children! Let me tell you how to make a very simple eagle pen holder.

First, take a look at the picture here. One piece is the eagle's body, and the other is the eagle's wings. First, enlarge the two parts on drawing paper and then color them.

The second step is to paste them onto cardboard and cut them out after they are dry. At this time, you can insert the mortise and tenon together, and the eagle frame will be successful. Isn't it very easy?

If the material is not cardboard, but thin bamboo chips or lead sheets, and then painted with colored paint on the outside, it will be more durable and more beautiful.

### Cao Yu's Satirical Comedy

— Sha Fei

Following "Song of Righteousness," the Shanghai Drama Society will perform Cao Yu's adapted satirical comedy, "Gilded." The play was originally titled "Blinding Sand."

"Gilded," in two acts, has a simple story:

"Doctor Ma Shouqing has a daughter named Ma Meie, who is just of age. Mr. Zhao Yunting has a grown son named Zhao Wenming. These two young people spend their days playing music and singing together, and secretly fall in love. Later, after some negotiation between the parents, they decide to arrange a marriage, a union of two noble families. However, to save face, they have to put on a lavish display, and in order to support this 'gilded' facade, they almost tear apart the young couple's love affair."

I have always been very fond of Cao Yu's plays, such as "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise." Although this satirical comedy is just for the audience to laugh at, upon closer examination, it is completely targeted at reality, targeted at Shanghai. He portrays many hypocrites who only care about appearances and don't care about the reality inside, running around every day, busy and busy, just putting on a show and acting powerful.

Hong Mo's direction of "Gilded" is quite light and witty. In terms of actors, Han Fei, who plays Ma Shouqing, pretends to have fake hair on his fake bald head, and is funny in every word and deed. Bai Li's portrayal of Mrs. Ma is a typical shrew, just right. Others, such as Zhi Jun as Zhao Yunting, Mei Cun as Mrs. Zhao, and He Bin as Zhao Ershu, are also competent. But the most humorous is Tian Ran as Zhao Wenming, with a strange voice, strange walk, and even stranger posture, simply a bizarre character. As soon as he says a word, the audience laughs along, and the whole hall is filled with laughter - from the opening to the closing.

In addition to "Gilded," the one-act play "The Proposal" is also being performed. This play is originally by Chekhov, adapted by Ping Qun, and directed by Zuo Lin.

In "The Proposal," we see Lord Li, who bullies the poor and loves the rich (played by Yan Jun), that is, stripping away the social facade, we see the myriad aspects of ordinary people. Jian Ping plays Zhao Baoshi, who is a cripple, and Dai Yun plays Li Songzhen, who is a hunchback. These two ugly people meet together. The story of the play has a very good intention and is extremely interesting. I love Yan Jun's Lord Li the most. He recites his lines fluently, and his expressions of laughter, sorrow, and hatred are all very authentic.

"Gilded" and "The Proposal" are both excellent satirical comedies. Standing in the position of a purely objective audience, I would like to sincerely recommend them to all those who love drama.

### Zhang Wenjuan to Return to Shanghai to Perform

— Dr. Lu

Beijing is the birthplace of Peking Opera and the place where famous actors are produced. To pursue advanced studies in Peking Opera, it is best to "study abroad" in Beijing. Here, we are talking about Zhang Wenjuan. Like the previous year, she resolutely went to Beijing with a fighting heart, and has been away from Shanghai for almost two years. Such a young girl can already sing with flavorful sounds and pleasing tones. I heard that she has a very good reputation in Beijing, and she is also a female actor who is saving face for the Jiangnan region. She is now resting at home due to the hot weather in Beijing, diligently practicing Kunqu Opera. Rumor has it that she will be performing in Shanghai soon. With her talent and the art that has been nurtured for two years, as well as her popularity in Shanghai, she will definitely be able to achieve the best results in the future.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 11: A Valiant Figure Comes to Fight Fiercely

Li Zicheng was horrified and had no idea what to do. Niu Jinxing immediately ordered his subordinates to shoot arrows at the fire, like locusts flying, to protect the central army tent. At the same time, he ordered the troops behind not to retreat, or they would be beheaded. Zhou Yuji could not break through after all. A tiger riding a slippery-backed horse, grabbed a Zao Yang spear, rushed forward, and shouted, "Zhou, don't mess around, I, Luo, am not afraid of you!" He thrust the spear forward and fought fiercely with Zhou Yuji. Xu Jing took the opportunity to enter, charged and killed for a while, but was also shot by random arrows and could not go deep. He heard fierce shouts of killing on the left, knowing that Zhou Yuji was fighting the rebels, so he urged his men to kill into the fire. The two sides fought fiercely for a while. As it approached the fifth watch (around 4 AM), Zhou Yuji saw that the rebels were becoming more and more numerous and had prepared themselves, fearing that he would be surrounded, so he and Xu Jing withdrew their troops. The rebels did not dare to pursue and kill in the night. Zhou Yuji retreated into the city, and the east was gradually turning white, and the rain was gradually stopping. He said to Xu Jing, "Tonight we fought very happily. The rebels must have suffered at least several thousand casualties. It is a pity that we failed to kill the rebel leader, but we have also thwarted their spirit." He then instructed Xu Jing and the soldiers to rest. He himself handed over the city's defenses to Zhang Lie and Fan Cheng, and also returned to the yamen to sleep for a while. When he woke up, it was almost noon. After a little food, he heard that the rebels had come to attack the city again, and he went up to the city to defend it again. He was worried that the bows and arrows would be in short supply, so he instructed the craftsmen to make them quickly. He also ordered the people to carry stones to the city to defend against the attack. That day, Li Zicheng was very angry because the official army had raided his camp and suffered losses the night before, so he waited for his men to come and attack fiercely. The southwest gates were attacked even more fiercely. Zhou Yuji guarded the west city himself, ordered Xu Jing and Zhang Lie to guard the south gate, and ordered Fan Cheng to take charge of the northeast gates. The rebel soldiers attacked for a long time, but the city was as solid as gold, and they did not gain any advantage. Li Zicheng saw that Daizhou was so difficult to take down, and Zhou Yuji was also a brave general, so he was very anxious. He went to Taiyuan to mobilize a large number of rebels to come and reinforce him. He himself surrounded the southwest gates and attacked them day and night. After three days, both the official army and the rebels were a little tired. Xu Jing saw from the south gate that there were clouds of rebels under the city, and the attack was becoming more and more urgent. It turned out that the rebels' fresh troops had arrived, so they intensified their attack on the city. (102)
