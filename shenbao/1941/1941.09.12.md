### U.S. Presidential Broadcast Speech Eve: White House Holds Important Meeting; Major Decisions on International Situation Expected; U.S. Congress to Convene Early on the 15th

United Press International, Washington, 11th - President Roosevelt arrived in Washington on the evening of the 10th via special train from Hyde Park. The President immediately met at the White House with Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Colonel Stimson, and Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox.

United Press International, Washington, 11th - Members of the House of Representatives were summoned yesterday to convene in Washington on the 15th, canceling the previously scheduled meeting for September 22nd. President Roosevelt summoned Congressional leaders to the White House this morning. Given these circumstances, there is widespread belief that significant developments are imminent regarding the international situation.

United Press International, En Route to Washington on the President's Special Train, 10th - President Roosevelt's convening of a meeting with the Secretary of State, Secretary of War, and Secretary of the Navy on the evening of the 10th indicates that a major decision will be made regarding the international situation. The President's international broadcast speech on the evening of the 11th has been extended from the originally planned fifteen minutes to twenty-five minutes. The President's speech, it is said, has been heavily revised due to recent developments. Observers speculate that the President's summoning of legislative leaders from both houses of Congress will involve discussing the possibility of repealing the Neutrality Act. They recall that President Roosevelt mentioned in his Labor Day address that the United States needs to increase its shipping to protect the transport of wartime supplies to countries resisting the Axis powers. Many also speculate that the President's speech on Thursday evening will include a request for naval protection of ships transporting war materials to the enemies of the Axis powers. Furthermore, it is said that the President may take stronger naval actions to prevent the plundering of American ships. Observers suggest that the President may also indicate that he will ask Congress to repeal the Neutrality Act so that American ships can operate in the ports of Britain or other belligerent nations.

Reuters, Washington, 11th - According to dispatches from President Roosevelt's special train, the President has completed his speech on foreign affairs and is scheduled to deliver it from the White House at 11:00 PM Shanghai time on the 12th. The President finished drafting his speech at his home in Hyde Park before boarding the train to Washington and instructed his secretariat to arrange meetings with Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Secretary of War Stimson in Washington. When asked by President's Secretary Hassett whether these discussions were related to the broadcast speech, Hassett replied, "You can guess for yourself." The President was accompanied by his wife, and Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins boarded the President's special train in New York and traveled with them to Washington.

International News Service, Washington, 11th - President Roosevelt's convening of a cabinet meeting and the reconvening of Congress next Monday have led many to believe that the President is now making demands to prepare for the immediate repeal of the Neutrality Act, or at least to substantially amend it. The reason Congress is convening a week earlier is clearly to expedite the passage of the government's new tax revenue bill. It is also understood that the President's speech will be broadcast nationwide and relayed via shortwave in fourteen languages.

### Repeal of Neutrality Act Request: Senate Likely to Pass It

United Press International, Washington, 11th - The President will meet with leaders of both the Democratic and Republican parties in Congress at the White House this morning. They will likely discuss the amendment or repeal of the Neutrality Act. This morning's meeting will undoubtedly be a continuation of last night's meeting, as the President met with the Secretary of State, Secretary of War, and Secretary of the Navy at the White House for an hour and a half last night, and no statement was issued afterward. It is noted that the President convened leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties at the White House on May 27th, which was before the President delivered his fireside chat declaring an unlimited national emergency. Currently, members of Congress have been expressing strong criticism of official suggestions that the President, due to incidents such as the torpedoing of the U.S. destroyer Greer and the frequent sinking of American ships, has decided to request that Congress repeal the Neutrality Act. However, members of Congress who support the executive branch favor repealing the Neutrality Act. According to informal surveys in the Senate, it has become clear that if the President requests the repeal of the Neutrality Act, the Senate will likely pass it, with no more than thirty or so dissenting votes. Congressional leaders generally believe that if the President requests that Congress repeal the Neutrality Act, the President can hope to achieve three purposes: (1) To abolish the war zones declared in accordance with current regulations, allowing American ships to transport items stipulated under the Lend-Lease Act to ports currently prohibited, such as Murmansk and Arkhangelsk in Soviet territory; (2) To arm merchant ships, which is currently prohibited. If the Neutrality Act is repealed, merchant ships can be armed, allowing them to defend themselves against attacks from aircraft and submarines, avoiding the fate of ships like the Sessa and Steel Seafarer; (3) To provide military escorts or other methods to protect American ships transporting American military supplies to countries resisting the Axis powers.

International News Service, Washington, 11th - President Roosevelt, in preparation for his broadcast speech tonight, reportedly consulted with his advisors on the latest international situation. It is said that in this speech, the President will respond to Germany's three challenges to America's maritime freedom policy. The White House today declined to comment on the content of the President's speech, only emphasizing that it is extremely important.

### Taylor's Audience with the Pope Related to U.S. Aid to the Soviet Union

United Press International, Vatican City, 11th - Pope Pius XII received Roosevelt's personal representative, Mr. Taylor, in a private audience yesterday afternoon at half-past six. It is widely believed that the Pope had originally planned to receive him today but moved it up one day at Taylor's request. Taylor said, "My private audience with the Pope yesterday lasted for forty-five minutes. Today, I will meet with the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Maglione, and I will have another audience with the Pope next week. I will return to the United States on September 22nd." Well-informed sources believe that Taylor discussed certain key points of President Roosevelt's forthcoming speech with the Pope. It is expected that Cardinal Maglione's reply today will be telegraphed to Washington. It is considered quite significant that Taylor met with Cardinal Maglione before his audience with the Pope, and that he will visit the Vatican Secretary of State again before Roosevelt's speech. Most Vatican observers believe this is related to American aid to the Soviet Union, especially in obtaining the Pope's support to reduce opposition from American Catholics to such aid.

Havas, Vatican City, 10th - When Taylor had an audience with the Pope on the evening of the 10th, he informed him of President Roosevelt's attitude toward the Soviet Union and stated that the United States is particularly concerned with the welfare of the Soviet people, regardless of the Soviet government's organization.

### China Focuses Attention on U.S.-Japan Talks

Reuters, Chongqing, 11th - On the eve of President Roosevelt's broadcast, people here are focusing their attention on the U.S.-Japan discussions. Some still believe that it is possible for the U.S. and Japan to reach a compromise, while others believe that no resolution will be reached. According to reliable Chinese sources in Washington received here, the U.S.-Japan discussions have not yielded any solution. American sources here also hold the same view. It is said that the United States will not reach a compromise with Japan on the Far East situation unless a fundamental solution is achieved. Therefore, although there have been rumors of a temporary agreement between the U.S. and Japan, that possibility no longer exists, as the fundamental conditions set by the U.S. do not seem acceptable to Japan.

United Press International, Tokyo, 11th - Chugai Shogyo, which often reflects the policies of the current Japanese cabinet, suggested in a commentary today that Japan and the United States should reconcile and eliminate tensions that could lead to war. The newspaper stated that the United States and Japan should conduct the broadest study of the issues hindering friendly relations between the two countries, as there is still a chance to avoid armed conflict. The newspaper pointed out that the purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to maintain peace, not to promote war, but since Japan adhered to the pact, the United States has increased its pressure on Japan, creating the risk of promoting war. The newspaper also stated that Japan does not want outside interference in its East Asian program, but Japan's main goal is to establish permanent stability in East Asia.

### Australian Prime Minister Says Situation in Pacific is Improving; First Shipment of American Tanks Arrives in Australia

International News Service, Sydney, 11th - Australian Prime Minister Fadden stated that the Australian government has received official information that the situation in the Pacific appears to be improving. He added that he is in close contact with London and Washington regarding the Far East situation. Before Fadden made the above remarks, Australian Secretary of War Spender announced that the first shipment of American-made tanks had arrived in Australia, and that more American-made military supplies would be shipped to Australia in a steady stream.

### Hull Tells Reporters U.S.-Japan Talks Have No New Developments; U.S. Warned Japan Not to Make Southward or Northward Moves

Reuters, Washington, 11th - Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that he had no news of an imminent agreement or announcement regarding the U.S.-Japan talks, which have been ongoing for months. In fact, there have been no new developments in the U.S.-Japan situation. A reporter asked if it was true that a U.S.-Japan agreement would soon be announced, as rumored in Shanghai. Hull replied that he once encountered a very clever reporter who asked him a question, and he thought it was wise, or perhaps unwise, not to tell him everything he wanted to know. The reporter then said that even if he didn't hear anything, he would write about it anyway. Hull added that he imagined there must be several gentlemen in Shanghai with plenty of time on their hands who are busy writing.

United Press International, London, 11th - Diplomatic envoys here stated yesterday that they confirmed that Washington had warned Japan against making any further northward or southward moves. This warning was reportedly issued early in the U.S.-Japan negotiations, which have been ongoing for three weeks. It was also learned that this warning included a request that Japan not interfere with the shipment of American military supplies to Vladivostok in aid of the Soviet Union. Diplomatic circles also stated that if the U.S. warning to Japan included the threat of southward or northward expansion by Japan, then the value of the democratic countries' aid to the Soviet Union would be extremely significant.

### U.S. Actively Training New Marine Corps; Torleif to Take on Important Position

United Press International, Washington, 11th - After President Roosevelt approved the promotion of Brigadier General Torleif to the rank of Major General, the Navy Department announced last night that Torleif would be transferred from Commander of the 1st Marine Division at Quantico to Commander of the New River Marine Corps Base. The new Marine Corps is now formally training at that base. At the same time, the Navy Department also announced that Brigadier General Lowe had also been promoted to Major General and transferred to the Intelligence Division. The President has also approved this transfer. It is expected that Torleif will play an important role in supervising the organization of the new Marine Corps in the Atlantic. This new Marine Corps will receive special training in lightning-fast landing operations and attacking coastal installations. The new Marine Corps will be equipped with the latest and most powerful weapons and will use new-style barges and other modern landing equipment. Torleif has served in the Pacific, the Caribbean, and Europe. Lowe is a renowned aviator who has served in Cuba, the Philippines, Nicaragua, Haiti, and France. He will serve as Chief of the Intelligence Division.

### Japanese Students Nationwide Receive Military Training; Organization Is Identical to the Army

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 11th - According to an order issued yesterday by the Ministry of Education, all middle schools and universities in Japan will organize school teams into student armies so that all students can receive systematic preliminary military training. The organizational methods will be identical to those of the army, with the principal serving as the commander and officers from the army serving as advisors to the school. In the case of Waseda University, for example, it will be divided into twelve battalions or twenty-six companies. Elementary school students will also receive the same training.

### Britain Provides Assurance to U.S. Regarding Use of Lend-Lease Goods; Determined Not to Divert Them for Private Commercial Use; No Barter Agreement Between Britain and Japan

Reuters, London, 11th - The British government has published a White Paper containing correspondence between the British and American governments. In this document, the British government provides the U.S. government with a firm assurance regarding the use of American Lend-Lease goods. British Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday sent a memorandum to U.S. Ambassador Winant, stating in brief that all materials received by Britain under the Lend-Lease Act are necessary for prosecuting the war. The British government has taken and will continue to take steps to ensure that these materials are not diverted for the purpose of increasing private profits. Lend-Lease goods imported into Britain will not be re-exported, and the British government will not supply exporters with the same goods, opening up new markets or expanding export trade to the detriment of the United States. However, this does not include raw materials needed overseas to manufacture necessary war materials for the United States and the Allied powers that cannot be obtained directly from the United States.

Reuters, London, 11th - In the House of Commons, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Economic Warfare, Foot, spoke regarding the Japan barter agreement. Foot stated that Britain has not intended to enter into a general barter agreement with Japan or to take any action inconsistent with the implementation of the freezing orders. Frozen funds will not be allowed to be used for new exports to Japan. If licenses are occasionally issued for the exceptional need for certain special goods to be imported into Britain from Japan, consideration must be given to what goods should be shipped to Japan and how they should be paid for. If necessary, it would be best to establish a separate clearing account. However, no licenses for such imports have been issued at present, so there is no payment issue.

### British and Soviet Control of Iranian Transportation Lines; German and Italian Nationals All Arrested

Reuters, Simla, 11th - British and Soviet forces, in accordance with the agreement with Iran, have obtained control of key transportation lines within Iran, including the vital Trans-Iranian Railway.

Reuters, London, 11th - The 48-hour deadline set by British and Soviet authorities for the extradition of German nationals from Iran has now expired. All German and Italian nationals have been arrested and taken to major centers within Iran. Most will likely be detained within Iran, but there is also the possibility of them being moved to India.

Reuters, London, 11th - As a result of British and Soviet actions in Iran, Germany has not only lost a large supply of food but can no longer obtain large quantities of cotton, ramie, and boxwood. An expert from the British Ministry of Economic Warfare stated yesterday that Germany will lose 18,000 to 20,000 tons of cotton annually as a result. The shortage of cotton in Germany can be seen in the forced confiscation of most of the bedding of Jews in Germany. The ramie that Germany imported from Iran is also no longer available, further exacerbating the ramie shortage. Iranian boxwood is of excellent quality, and Germany used it to manufacture instruments for filling bombs and shells, as well as instruments used in mathematics.

Editorial

### China's Unchanging Established Policy

Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper, in analyzing US-Japan relations, touched on the Sino-Japanese issue, stating that regardless of whether the US-Japan talks involved this, there was no need for excessive worry or suspicion, but due to space constraints, the wording was not detailed. It is fortunate that last night we learned of Chairman Chiang's statement to the Associated Press regarding China's position, and we wish to continue the previous discussion and elaborate on it further.

The Sino-Japanese war has lasted for four years. For China, it is an unprecedentedly long-term and comprehensive foreign war, while for Japan, the wartime suffering that it had never experienced in the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, is now being personally experienced in the war against China. The shortage of manpower and material resources, and the major international repercussions, have all exceeded what Japan can endure. Chairman Chiang stated the day before yesterday that the Japanese military's combat power has been greatly weakened and is already at the end of its rope. This is a fact that is universally recognized, and even the Japanese themselves find it difficult to conceal or deny. However, although their strength is depleted, their desires have not diminished. The Japanese still yearn for the strength and prosperity that the First World War brought to Japan. Based on this idea, there was the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact and the brewing of southward and northward advances. However, considering the facts, even in the previous World War, Japan repeatedly disregarded its treaty obligations (the Anglo-Japanese Alliance), pursuing only its own interests, which caused the Allied countries to view it with suspicion. Although during the war, they could not avoid the dilemma of "hesitating to strike the rat for fear of breaking the vase," after the peace conference, the Washington Conference was used to restrain its limitless expansionist ambitions. In the past year, regardless of Japan's basic beliefs regarding the Tripartite Alliance, judging from what has been shown recently, it is clear that they have been disappointed with the future of the Axis powers, and have instead used this as a basis for threatening and extorting the nation. On the American side, because they earnestly hope for peace in the Pacific and believe that Japan can be coerced into submission, the US-Japan talks have been carried out. However, if the Axis powers' hopes were still as they were in the past and Japan's strength had not been damaged, it would certainly not be willing to conduct discussions with the United States under the frequent waving of the American club. This newspaper discussed this yesterday. Judging from Japan's consistent style, the past events of the previous World War have been described above. As for the recent situation, the Tripartite Alliance is the center of gravity of its national policy for many years, and now there are signs of gradual divergence. Japan has neutral obligations to the Soviet Union, a friendly nation, and it is still resentful of American oil shipments to the Soviet Union. Therefore, even if the US-Japan talks are successful, whether this new partner can be trusted and whether the Pacific can be worry-free are certainly not guarantees that anyone dares to make lightly. Even within the American authorities, they may not place too much weight on Japan's promises. On the one hand, they are negotiating with Japan, and on the other hand, they are stepping up support for China. The meaning and value of the statement "China is America's great defense" have not changed due to the US-Japan talks.

Japan is urgently seeking to hold talks with the United States because it cannot withstand the economic pressure from the democratic countries, and even more so because the war against China cannot be ended. The latter is the central difficulty. If most of its strength had not been consumed in the four years of long and arduous fighting, the extreme elements' grand pronouncements of not hesitating to go to war might have been adopted as Japan's current foreign policy. Even if Britain and the United States wanted peace in the Pacific, it would be impossible. In the past four years, China has stood firm as the only pillar of the democratic camp in the Far East. Even when the major powers of the world could not avoid being polite to it, China has always stood firm and has not wavered in its firm stance. For this reason, and because the democratic countries have turned from danger to safety and have enough strength to deal with the Far East, economic sanctions have been able to demoralize Japan. Although its fundamental idea of expansion remains as before, at present, it cannot help but slightly restrain its actions and instead hope to alleviate its predicament through negotiations. However, China's struggle and economic sanctions complement each other and reinforce each other. It should not be lightly abandoned before Japan has changed its fundamental stance. Chairman Chiang pointed out: "On the one hand, China will continue to fight, and on the other hand, economic sanctions against Japan will be intensified, or at least not relaxed." "This is a mutually understood agreement among the countries concerned in the Pacific," and it is also the only way to stop expansion and restore order in the Far East.

The general counter-offensive of the Chinese army has been commonly hoped for by Chinese and foreign people in recent years. In the past, there have been repeated rumors that it would be realized this autumn, but it has been delayed until now and has not been launched, which may inevitably disappoint some people. However, it must be understood that for the Chinese army, which has always been at a disadvantage in terms of equipment and armaments, to achieve satisfactory results in the counter-offensive, it cannot rely solely on determination, courage, and manpower, and there must be sufficient preparation. The American Lend-Lease Act was only passed and implemented this spring, just a few months ago, and in the past, the focus was still on supporting Britain. The delivery of large quantities of supplies to China and the dispatch of military advisors are recent matters. With the development of British industry, the strength of its national power, and the large-scale supply of American war equipment, it has not yet been able to take advantage of the opportunity of the major war on the Eastern Front to launch a large-scale counter-offensive. It is therefore not surprising that China's general counter-offensive has been delayed. However, since the supreme military commander of China stated to American reporters the day before yesterday that he would fight to the end and make the necessary sacrifices, this is no different from an indirect announcement of the launch of the Chinese army's counter-offensive. Ten days ago, the Chinese army in various areas of the Eastern Theater launched several local counter-offensives, achieving considerable results and recovering several important towns. Recently, there have also been new and wise measures in the financial and fiscal areas, and the rear provinces have generally had bumper harvests, greatly reducing the threat of food shortages. All of this is enough to enhance the confidence of victory. Therefore, no matter whether the outcome of the US-Japan talks is temporary peace or a change for the worse, it is not enough to determine the basic trend in the Far East. Everything thereafter will mainly depend on China's continued struggle.

### Central District Front 200 Miles: Soviet-German Tank Battle; Germans Retreat on Upper Reach of the Dnieper, Fierce Battle for Leningrad Underway

Reuters, London, 11th: It is reported that General Timoshenko's troops are launching offensives at three locations on a 200-mile front stretching from 40 miles northeast of Smolensk to Gomel.

International News Service, Moscow, 11th: The Red Army High Command reported today that the large-scale retreat of German forces along the 200-mile central front is continuing. The three-pronged Soviet offensive has pushed the German forces across the upper reaches of the Dnieper River, forcing them closer to the important central areas of Smolensk and Gomel. The scale of this German retreat is only seen since the collapse of the German army in 1918. The current Soviet offensive is being personally directed by Marshal Timoshenko. The Soviet army has eliminated more than 80,000 German soldiers, hundreds of tanks, and countless other military equipment. The German army's fierce bombing of Leningrad to force its surrender has failed. However, only a few German planes penetrated the heavily defended city of Leningrad, causing several fires within the city.

Reuters, London, 11th: According to the latest news received, the fierce battle for Leningrad is still underway and has not diminished in intensity. In the central district, General Timoshenko's Soviet troops are inflicting new blows on the German forces. Last night, the Germans reported that Soviet tanks and infantry attacked German positions approximately 40 miles northeast of Smolensk. News from Moscow also stated that a major tank battle is taking place in the area south of Smolensk, with German and Austrian casualties reaching as high as 80,000. The Soviet army in the Gomel area to the south is currently launching a major counter-offensive in an attempt to halt the German advance on Kyiv. At the same time, at the northern end, the German forces attempting to break through the defenses of Leningrad have suffered heavy casualties. Germany is now sparing no effort to advance in order to quickly achieve victory, and claims to have gathered the largest number of aircraft to attack the fortifications of Leningrad. Yesterday, London clearly received broadcasts directly from the front line by the Leningrad radio station, where the rumble of artillery, the commands of Soviet artillery officers, and all the sounds of battle could be heard simultaneously, giving a clear impression of Timoshenko leading his troops in fierce battle against the enemy.

Reuters, Moscow, 11th: A war report from "Red Star" stated that General Timoshenko's Soviet troops, in a fierce counter-offensive southeast of Smolensk, have driven the German forces back to the opposite bank of the "N" River, and destroyed 238 German tanks, 50 aircraft, 486 trucks, and 135 artillery pieces. Approximately 4,000 German soldiers drowned in the river. Although this statement does not specify the name of the river, the Dnieper River meanders south between Smolensk and Yartsevo (which has been recovered by the Soviet army), 45 miles southeast of the city. The "Red Star" report also stated that "our brave troops continued to fight, destroying enemy soldiers and equipment, and forcing the German forces to retreat to the opposite bank of the river. The German commander in this area has gathered several tank divisions and mechanized units to make a wedge-shaped incursion, intending to advance east. The Soviet Air Force has been fiercely attacking the enemy's rear day and night for several days, and tanks have also been fighting alongside aircraft, continuing for five days. Soviet tanks have fiercely attacked the enemy's columns, and the enemy has tried to prevent our army from advancing. The battle for the crossing points is particularly fierce. Our army finally broke through the enemy's resistance, and the battle to defeat the enemy's mechanized units is continuing."

Reuters, London, 11th: It is rumored that the Soviet army has recovered the Smolensk city area, but the Soviet side has not yet confirmed or denied this. Within a few days, there may be no trace of German troops in the Dnieper River, and as a result of the Soviet counter-offensive, the threat of the German army encircling the Soviet army defending the Dnieper River from the north will be completely eliminated. If this is the case, then if the German side wants to seize the remaining half of Ukraine, it must forcibly cross the lower reaches of the Dnieper River and launch a frontal assault.

### German Aircraft Attack Leningrad, Fierce Air Battle Erupts

Reuters, Moscow, 11th: A Soviet communiqué stated that on the 9th, several formations of German aircraft raided Leningrad, but each time they were repelled by Soviet air force and anti-aircraft fire. However, at approximately 10:00 PM, several German aircraft separately flew to Leningrad, flying very high, and dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs on various parts of the city, resulting in several residential areas catching fire. The Soviet Air Force and anti-aircraft guns destroyed a total of 31 German aircraft inside and outside Leningrad, and while attacking enemy airfields.

Havas News Agency, Berlin, 10th: This radio station recently broadcast a message stating that air battles between the German and Soviet air forces occurred in the sky today, with a total of 17 Soviet aircraft shot down.

### German and Finnish Armies Join Forces, First Snowfall in Northern Finland

Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 12th: According to news from Helsinki this morning, the German motorized units on the northern front have crossed the Volkhov and Svir Rivers, and have made contact with the Finnish army west of Lake Ladoga. However, military and political figures are paying attention to the Soviet central front, where it has been confirmed that the Soviet army is launching a counter-offensive near Smolensk and Gomel.

Havas News Agency, Helsinki, 11th: The first snowfall occurred in the north today, indicating the arrival of the snow season. After this, major changes may occur on the northern front.

### Odessa's Defenses Remain Strong After Being Besieged for Nearly a Month

Reuters, London, 11th: According to the Soviet official TASS news agency, after being besieged for nearly a month, the garrison of the major Black Sea port of Odessa is increasingly determined. All residents of the area have been ordered to defend the city. News leaked from Romania stated that the Romanian side is shocked by the heavy losses of its troops. The Romanian army, advancing on Odessa, has made no progress in a month.

TASS, Odessa, 11th: The unity and dedication of the entire city of Odessa are unprecedented. The entire city has been active since early morning. Male and female workers are rushing to work in factories, while young women are serving in hospitals. Women and children are carrying buckets and shovels, building fortifications. Strong fortifications have been built around Odessa, capable of resisting heavy artillery fire. Factories are working hard to accelerate production, and all supplies for the defense of the city are being rapidly manufactured. Workers have taken up guns to defend their city, fighting bravely at the city gates.

### Soviet and Italian Air Forces Clash for the First Time, 3 Out of 10 Italian Aircraft Destroyed

### British Fighter Aircraft Participate in Soviet War

Associated Press, London, 11th: The Ministry of Aviation announced today that hundreds of Royal Air Force fighter aircraft have been sent to the Soviet Union, and many of them are already fighting there.

### British Aircraft Attack Italy, Turin Armory Bombed

Reuters, London, 11th: Last night, several British heavy bombers carried out an unprecedentedly fierce bombing raid in northern Italy. The Italian Royal Armory in Turin was also among those bombed, causing a fire that was very intense. The last time British aircraft bombed northern Italy was in January of this year, when bombs were dropped in Turin and near Marghera port near Venice. Reuters, Rome, 11th: A communiqué from the Italian Supreme Command stated that British aircraft bombed Genoa, Turin, and Messina.

Reuters, London, 11th: A communiqué from the Air Raid Department stated that British aircraft raided Italy last night, with one team bombing the northern industrial area and another bombing the extreme end of Sicily. The bombers used by the British side were four-engine Stirling (Britain's largest bomber), four-engine Halifax, and various two-engine types, making at least a 1,600-mile non-stop flight. As a result, four went missing.

### Thousands of German Soldiers Set Out for Sardinia

People without passports are not allowed to enter the island. It is expected that the German side intends to strengthen the African front.

### The Sorrow of a Defeated Nation: Vichy Bears the Maintenance Costs of the German Army, Reaching 400 Million Francs Per Day

Reuters, London, 11th: It is heard from well-informed diplomatic sources in neutral countries that negotiations between Vichy and Germany to reduce the maintenance costs of the occupying forces have been going on for some time, but have now reached a stalemate. This fee is still paid at the original figure of 400 million francs per day. Earlier this year, Vichy Deputy Prime Minister Darlan mentioned the generosity of the Germans, saying that the occupation fee had been reduced. The failure of the current negotiations is probably because Vichy cannot or is unwilling to pay the occupation fee in gold.

### Japanese Troops in Northern Hunan Launch Major Incursion, Met with Fierce Interception by Chinese Troops; Fierce Battle in Southern Shanxi, Japanese Repelled; Chinese Troops Achieve Results in Northern Jiangxi and Northern Hubei

Chongqing Military News: (1) The Japanese troops stirring up trouble in Northern Hunan continue to increase. On the 7th, one route invading Nanshan, Gaoling, and Jianjiaqiao from Zhongfang was increased to over 9,000, with three additional routes totaling over 3,000. In the afternoon, they invaded the Mengcheng Nancong area. On the same day, one route invading from Taolin Xitang was also increased to over 5,000, invading the areas of Jipocen and Caoxiecen, with one route of over 1,000 invading the areas of Changanqiao and Gantian. The Chinese army is intercepting the invading Japanese troops in the vicinity of these areas, while also dispatching powerful units to encircle the Japanese from the rear, and fierce battles have begun, with all units fiercely attacking the Japanese. (2) A certain unit of the Chinese army in the triangular area of Southern Shanxi launched a fierce attack on the Japanese stronghold of Dalizhuang in the morning of the 3rd. The battle was fierce until noon, and the Japanese, unable to withstand the attack, retreated into the village to resist stubbornly. The Chinese troops followed and pursued them into the village, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese. By about 3:00 PM, the Japanese had been killed or wounded by more than half. Subsequently, the Japanese sent reinforcements from five routes: one route of over 300 via Paochangkou from Anyi through the east, one route of 600 to 700 through the salt ponds, one route of over 200 from Bazheng through Fengxie Village, and one route of over 100 from Zhangcun through Huojun Temple, attempting to encircle the Chinese army. The Japanese in the village also took the opportunity to launch a counterattack on the Chinese army. Deng Yun, the commander of a certain unit of the Chinese army, was once trapped by the Japanese, but he fought bravely and killed many of the Japanese who were besieging him, breaking out of the village. Battalion Commander Luo rushed to his rescue, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese. The Chinese reserve forces arrived, and after fierce fighting until midnight, they repelled the Japanese who were counterattacking from the village, switching from the inner line to the outer line to continue attacking the Japanese with mobile tactics. (3) A certain unit of the Chinese army in Northern Jiangxi launched an attack on the Japanese in Changbu, west of Nanchang, last month. They encountered the Japanese at Mumacun Xiashanyang. The Japanese again sent reinforcements from Xiangfang. After fierce fighting all day, the Chinese army bravely defeated them, killing and wounding many Japanese soldiers and seizing some military supplies. (4) A certain unit of the Chinese army in Northern Hubei attacked Zhangjiawan, west of Dushongshan (south of Suixian), on the evening of the 5th, killing and wounding many Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, the Japanese from Dushongshan came to their aid, but the Chinese had already returned in triumph.

Japanese Troops Invading Hukou Repelled

A Certain Place in Southern Anhui: One unit of Japanese troops in Hukou launched an attack on Xujiabu, southeast of Hukou, on the morning of the 7th under the cover of artillery fire.

Luoyang: On the evening of the 2nd, a certain unit of the Chinese army dispatched a team to attack the vicinity of Shizhe, west of Changzi City, rushing into the village and engaging in street fighting with the Japanese. By the morning of the 3rd, they had killed and wounded many Japanese soldiers and destroyed one blockhouse and many fortifications. On the morning of the 3rd, a unit of Japanese troops from Yimenji, northwest of Guoyang, used six cars to harass Baimiaoji in Northern Hao. They were ambushed by a certain unit of the Chinese army's guerrillas and local militia, killing many Japanese soldiers and seizing many spoils of war. The Japanese fled back along the original route. On the afternoon of the 5th, the Japanese troops in Anyang invaded Guojia, southwest of the city. After fierce fighting with a certain unit of the Chinese army until night, they were finally repelled by the Chinese army, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops retreated to Anyang in defeat (November 11th dispatch). The Japanese troops in Xingji, Wanquan, Jiwangshan, Zhangba, and other places have been harassing the northwestern area of Jiwangshan in groups since the 3rd. The Chinese army is currently dividing its forces to suppress them (September 9th dispatch).

Japanese Troops Along PingSui Railway Suffer Heavy Losses

Yulin: A certain unit of the Chinese army along the PingSui Railway has repeatedly inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army. At about 9:00 AM on the 22nd of last month, they buried mines and explosives on the railway at the Gongjiban Station of the Suiju Road and hid in ambush on both sides. When a Japanese train came from the east, the mine exploded immediately, and the train was overturned. The Chinese ambush troops saw that the train was destroyed and quickly launched an attack, throwing hand grenades into the train. All the Japanese soldiers in the train were killed. The Chinese troops completed their mission and returned to their defenses safely (October 10th dispatch).

Japanese Aircraft Attacking Shaanxi Damaged

Xi'an: When Japanese aircraft attacked Jingyang and other counties in Shaanxi on the 4th, two aircraft were damaged after being fiercely fired upon by Chinese anti-aircraft artillery. In panic, the Japanese pilots dropped a machine gun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in the air above Yongledian in Jingyang County, and also dropped two machine guns near Gaoling. All of them were found by the local people and handed over to the county government. The machine gun found in Jingyang is a double-barreled Type 89, manufactured in February of Showa 15. The bullets and other items that have been transported to the province are now counted in full. It is said that the machine guns and explosives found in Gaoling will also be sent to the province (September 9th dispatch).

Japanese Transport Vehicles Hit Landmines

Chongqing Military News: Last month, the Japanese troops who had sneaked from Zhongfang Taolin Xitang to the Junchongtian area at the foot of the Dayun Mountains continued to sneak to the area north of Shenjiashan on the south side of the Dayun Mountains on the evening of the 5th, attempting to encircle and attack the Chinese Dayunshan Field Army. The Chinese troops took advantage of the terrain to lure the Japanese into the mountains, turning from Heqiao to the outer line, counter-encircling the Japanese. They launched an annihilation battle from midnight on the 8th, killing and wounding many Japanese soldiers. Fierce fighting is still intensifying. A certain unit of the Chinese army in the triangular area of Southern Shanxi launched an attack on Yuecun along the river to Renjiazhuang, southwest of Ruicheng, at midnight on the 2nd, destroying several miles of Japanese communication equipment in the area, and buried landmines in the area east of Renjiazhuang. On the morning of the 3rd, five Japanese transport vehicles, full of ammunition, drove west from Yuecun. Upon passing through this area, the landmines were triggered, destroying all the ammunition vehicles and killing all the escorting Japanese soldiers (October 10th dispatch).

### Bumper Rice Harvest in Various Provinces This Year

Chongqing: The rice harvest in various provinces this year is mostly better than last year. According to the Grain Production Increase Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the provinces with a 90% autumn harvest include Zhejiang and Yunnan, those with an 80% harvest include Sichuan, Guangdong, Henan, and Ningxia, those with a harvest of 70% to 80% include Jiangxi, Hunan, and Fujian, those with a harvest of 60% to 70% include Guizhou and Guangxi, and those with a harvest of less than 60% include Gansu, Shaanxi, and Hubei. The total average harvest for 14 provinces is 70%, an increase of 0.9% compared to last year's average harvest, estimated to increase rice by approximately (××××× million) market dan. Except for Guizhou Province, whose harvest is the same as last year, and the autumn harvests of Gansu, Fujian, Guangxi, Hubei, and Shaanxi, which are slightly lower than last year, all other provinces are better than last year. Among them, the increased quantities of Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Guangdong are the highest. It is noted that last year's severe drought in the southwestern provinces had a significant impact on the autumn harvest, and except for 1927, it was one of the lowest yields in the past ten years. Sichuan Province's autumn harvest last year was 55%, a decrease of (××× million) market dan compared to the previous year. Zhejiang Province's harvest last year was 56%, a decrease of (××× million) market dan compared to the previous year. Guangdong Province's harvest last year was 70%, a decrease of (××× million) market dan compared to the previous year.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Tells American Reporter: China Determined to Fight to the End Until Worldwide Peace is Achieved

Chongqing, 11th (Special dispatch from United Press correspondent Fei Shu) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek assured United Press reporters during a special interview yesterday that China will continue to resist Japan to the last person. Chairman Chiang also believes that as China continues to fight, the economic sanctions against Japan by the United States and other countries friendly to China will definitely be intensified, or at least not relaxed. Chairman Chiang stated, "This is a mutual understanding among the countries concerned in the Pacific to consistently implement a policy of resisting aggression." Chairman Chiang specially received the reporters in the afternoon, taking time out from his busy official duties at the wartime headquarters to explain the current situation in the Pacific. He said, "China has been resisting Japanese aggression for more than four years. Japan is a disturber of world peace, and it is now planning to develop its aggressive ambitions. However, Japan's combat power has been greatly weakened (Chairman Chiang smiled when he said this), and it is already at the end of its strength." When asked what he saw that led him to say this, he replied, "Japan's current situation is due to two major factors: one is China's resolute resistance, and the other is the economic sanctions against Japan led by the United States, such as freezing Japanese funds and prohibiting the export of military raw materials to Japan." When Chairman Chiang discussed the current Japanese-American talks, he said, "Japan's biggest goal in this move is obviously to try to make China stop resisting, or to resolve the so-called 'China Incident,' and to get the United States and other democratic countries to relax their economic sanctions against Japan." When asked if Japan had any hope of winning, Chairman Chiang said, "I can emphasize to our American friends that China will not change its policy of fighting to the end, and will make the necessary sacrifices again until a lasting and fair peace is truly achieved in the Far East and the world. At the same time, I hope and believe that while China continues to fight, the economic sanctions against Japan will be intensified, or at least not relaxed." Chairman Chiang Kai-shek warned those who are forgetful, saying, "Since the invasion of Manchuria in 1931, this government has adopted a national policy of making concessions on the one hand and openly threatening on the other. The Chinese government and the United States government have been repeatedly deceived by this kind of cunning trick in the past. I firmly believe that the governments of all friendly countries will show that they have learned a lesson from their painful experiences in dealing with Japan and will no longer be lured into a temporary illusion of security." Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, dressed in military uniform and in high spirits, discussed the issues in a cordial manner, expressing a deep understanding of the situation in the Pacific.

### New Fujian Chairman Liu Jianxu Takes Office; Former Chairman Chen Yi Departs Fujian by Special Train; Liu and Chen Issue Separate Statements

(Dispatch from the 8th)

Yongan: After Chairman Liu took office on the 9th, the reporter made a special visit. Chairman Liu said that the current problem in Fujian Province is food. There is probably no need to worry. The province is a food-deficient province. In the future, the government should use various methods to control various materials, balance supply and demand, and strictly practice economy. At the same time, it should adjust the actual situation of obstruction, accurately investigate the amount of surplus and shortage, and open up sources of supplementary rice from outside the province. Secondly, regarding local public security, it should seek to improve the Baojia organization, complete county administration work, and strengthen the foundation of governance, so that within the province, no matter in poor rural areas, people can live and work in peace. Liu continued that he will use this to encourage the people of Fujian to complete provincial administration and mobilize the strength of the entire province to strive for victory in the war. He also said that the four million overseas Fujianese compatriots love their motherland and care about their hometown, and his words were extremely sincere. He hopes that they will continue to maintain it in the future. (Dispatch from the 9th)

### Full Text of British Prime Minister's Speech (Continued from Yesterday)

No Ambition for Syria; Striving for Independence

The German conspiracy to collude with the Vichy French in Syria was also actively underway, and the Governor of Syria, Dentz, was doing his best to promote the German side's interests in a despicable and treacherous manner. At that time, we were under pressure, our army had withdrawn from Greece, and lost a large number of outposts, and was invaded by the German army in Africa, and we also had to deal with the rebellion in Iraq. However, we were finally able to join the Free French Army in entering Syria. The Free French Army fought bravely, and the British Army, about four divisions, including Australian and Indian troops, repeatedly achieved victories. The British occupation of Syria ensured the safety of Cyprus, stabilized part of the Near East, and made the control of the eastern end of the Mediterranean by our navy and air force more efficient, and we were also able to make direct contact with our Turkish friends and control the oil pipeline and other resources. We have no ambition in Syria, neither wanting to replace France in any part of Syria, nor wanting to seize French interests. We only entered Syria in order to win the war. However, I must state that the Free French have agreed to our policy, which is to hand Syria over to the Syrians, who will regain their independence and sovereignty at the earliest possible time.

Axis Difficult to Cross the Line; Dreams of Invading Egypt Shattered

At the same time, the eastern wing of my Nile River army has inflicted two major blows on the German-Italian army that is trying to retake Cyrenaica. The enemy army has realized that it cannot attack Egypt, because it has failed to capture the She Bai Lu Ke pass, which is firmly defended by the British-Australian army. Our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Xisha Han in May and June. Although it failed to drive back the enemy army, it has stopped the enemy army from advancing. The German's wild claim that they could reach the Suez Canal by the end of May has proved to be worthless. Fresh troops from our side have arrived at the front line of the Nile River one after another. I believe that we will definitely be able to defend Egypt and prevent the enemy army from crossing the Western Desert. The unfortunate setback that our side suffered in early April after defeating the Italian army has now been eliminated. We can truly be satisfied with this satisfactory development.

Commending the Red Army's Resistance; Effective Assistance Will Be Given

Turning to a larger range of battles, the Soviet army's strong resistance and its amazing way of retreating from the vast front line have indeed shattered Hitler's hopes of a quick victory over the Soviet Union. Three months after the start of the German-Soviet war, Hitler shed more Germanic blood than was spilled on the battlefield in any year of the last World War. In the future, he will have to maintain an army stationed on the entire front line from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea, on an extremely long and dangerous transportation line, when the severe cold rages in the north and the Soviet army launches fierce counterattacks. Since the day Germany invaded the Soviet Union, we have devoted all our efforts to providing our new comrade country with the most rapid and effective assistance. I do not want to discuss the military plans we have already studied to cause hindrance, nor can I debate this issue. All I can say is that in terms of supply, I agree with President Roosevelt's letter to Stalin. This need is extremely urgent and the scope is extremely large. Now a large part of the Soviet Union's munitions and steel production has fallen into the hands of the Germans, and the Soviet Union must also equip an army of 10 million to 15 million soldiers.

The Opening of the Three-Nation Conference in Moscow is Not Far Away

Therefore, the Soviet-British-American conference will work on how to enable the Soviet Union to continue to resist and how to adjust the supply. In arranging this conference or selecting the attendees, some delays are inevitable, or some may say that nothing has been done. In fact, the discussion of the entire issue has never stopped on the British and American sides. We are now waiting for the arrival of the American delegation. I expect the American mission to arrive soon. The British representative is led by Beaverbrook, who will have very close talks with President Roosevelt. The people traveling with Beaverbrook have already been selected, and their names will be announced when the time is appropriate. As for the departure date, it is not convenient to disclose, but it must not be far away. At present, many very important and urgent decisions are being made, and a large number of supplies are already on their way. In terms of munitions, we must be prepared to make major sacrifices to meet the needs of the Soviet Union. (The crowd cheers. Anyone related to production must make great efforts, not only to aid the Soviet Union, but also to fill the gaps in our urgently needed supplies. Everything given to the Soviet Union is taken from what we make ourselves, or taken from the American military supplies originally intended to be delivered to Britain. The production of Britain and the British Empire is now increasing steadily. In the third year of the war, munitions production can reach its full height. If the United States fulfills its self-determined work, then very large factories must still be established or transformed, and the consumption of the American people must also be reduced. The supply of American military supplies that we relied on before may be temporarily or will be reduced, but within a certain limit, we are fully prepared to accept this fact.

Opening Up the Iranian Route Facilitates the Transport of Soviet War Equipment

We are clearly faced with other limiting factors, such as time, distance, and local conditions. The convenience of transportation and seaports has its limits, especially shipping. There are only three routes open to enter the Soviet Union. One is the Arctic Ocean route through Archangel. This route may be blocked by winter ice. The second is the Far East route through Vladivostok, which is envied by the Japanese. Its railway line is more than 7,000 miles long. The third is the route across Persia, which extends 500 miles from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea. The Caspian Sea has a strong Soviet navy and can directly reach the Volga region in the center of the Soviet Union. Of the above three routes, the Persian route is the shortest. The Germans, of course, use their old tricks to operate in Persia. Therefore, German tourist groups, missions, and diplomats confuse the Persian government and the public in order to create a fifth column, so as to control the Tehran government and close our most stable and shortest route to the Soviet Union. It is not only to seize or destroy oil fields. We therefore believe that it is necessary to stop this activity and prevent it from succeeding. We have asked the Persian government to immediately expel the Teutons. We must put all the local Germans and Italians under our control. (The crowd cheers.) And we must make the German and Italian embassies withdraw from Persia. As for their diplomatic status, we will of course respect them. We must have the undisputed right to manage and maintain the transportation from the warm-water port of Basra to the Caspian Sea. (The crowd cheers.) So that British and American supplies can be continuously transported to the center of the Soviet Union from here. We will make various efforts to improve railway transportation and expand the number of supplies that can be transported on the current British-gauge railway. Fortunately, this railway has just been completed recently and only requires a large number of vehicles and locomotives to expand this supply line. I think the House will approve of the rigorous plan that we have had to adopt to achieve this essential goal. (The crowd cheers.) The occupation of Persia can enable our troops to join hands with the southern wing of the Soviet army and carry out land and air force operations, and can enable us to achieve the goal of preventing the German advance to the east. At this time, the meritorious Indian army can take on a greater task and keep the war away from the homes of Indians thousands of miles away. Therefore, we must expect that our British-Indian army, as well as Australian or other Dominion armies, will gradually expand their power in this vast, barren, and undeveloped area. Now the allied army's line forms a semicircle, starting from Spitsbergen Island in the Arctic Ocean to Tobruk in the Western Desert.

The Status of Britain Has Changed; Ensuring Maritime Security

I can happily say that the ample naval strength now available in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans can prevent the sea lanes from being attacked. If we look back on the past, we will definitely feel that our position in the Near East or the East has indeed improved significantly, which cannot be compared with the situation when France suddenly withdrew from the war and Italy launched a fierce attack on us. Because at that time, the number of troops we were stationed in various parts of the Near East was small and the equipment was extremely lacking. All of the best of them had been sent to the French front. We also lost the tool of safe transportation through the Mediterranean Sea, and the main base we relied on, and the defenses of various places in Africa and the Nile River basin and Palestine, such as Cairo and Jerusalem, also made us feel worried all the time. At that time, there was no safe place. But after a year, the situation has changed. We have formed a large army of 750,000 men and have obtained various equipment. Our air force has been greatly developed and is rapidly expanding. We have conquered Italy's entire empire in Africa and killed and captured more than 400,000 Italian troops. We have consolidated the border defenses of Egypt to prevent attacks from the German-Italian army. We have strengthened our position in Palestine and Iraq. We have control of Syria and given safety to Cyprus. With swift and powerful action, we have joined forces with the Soviet army in Persia and are on the route to prevent the enemy from advancing eastward. No matter what happens in the future, this achievement will definitely be admired by history. Britain's needs do not allow for any form of prior exaggeration. This is not the time to boast. But a year ago, our situation was very dark. This is a fact. Today, we might as well tell people that we are still the masters of our own destiny and the guardians of our own souls.

Members Unanimously Express Support for the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration

During the British Prime Minister's speech, the ambassadors of China, the Soviet Union, and Spain, as well as the high commissioners of South Africa, Australia, and Canada to the UK, were in the audience. The British Prime Minister reviewed the war situation and presented the facts without paying attention to rhetoric. Labour Party opposition member Lees-Smith said that he felt that the current situation in Britain was indeed more satisfactory than it was a year ago. There were four major turning points in the war: one was the fall of France, the second was the Battle of Britain, the third was the American Lend-Lease Act, and the fourth was the Soviet Union's magical resistance, which surprised not only the German command but also the world's general staffs. He very much hoped that the British-American eight-point declaration would be implemented as soon as possible. If land forces had to be sent to the European continent, he hoped that there would be adequate preparations to attack rather than always take the defensive. Egypt was a country suitable for winter warfare. Hitler's great effort to transport supplies across the Mediterranean showed that Hitler also knew that Egypt was suitable for winter warfare. Liberal Party leader Harris agreed on the necessity of doing his best to aid the Soviet Union and said that the eight-point declaration was the Atlantic Charter signed by the two great modern men, and it was the foundation on which we built. He very much hoped that both the British and American Congresses would ratify this Charter, and then it would be passed by the Allied governments. Lord Privy Seal Attlee opposed the criticism of this Atlantic Charter, saying that the statements made by the leaders of the two great powers, Britain and the United States, could only involve general principles. At present, it is impossible to talk about the detailed procedures to be applied to the future world. The British government and its people have decided to do everything they can to help the Allies. Communist Party member Gallagher interjected, "Does everyone in the government think so?" Attlee replied, "Yes, everyone thinks so. Everything that can be done will be done. We will give the Soviet Union what we can give, but it must be known that this must be taken from production, and our production is not enough to meet our needs. We are prepared to sacrifice and prepare to increase production." (End of full text)

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculative Yarn Merchants Conserve Energy; Listen to Roosevelt's Speech and Decide the Outcome Again

The yarn market has re-entered a state of dormancy. This is because most people are bearish, so the amount of short selling has increased significantly. The concept of short sellers is that the international situation may change, and they are all conserving energy, waiting for the President's speech to be announced today before deciding the outcome again. Therefore, the market is very dull and weak. As for the amount absorbed by large households, they also do not give up. It is conceivable that the struggle between the two sides is fierce. I don't know who will win. However, the current yarn Hong Kong gangs are purchasing very little. Some people also say that the transactions directly negotiated by foreign firms in Southeast Asia are quite active, but there is a shortage of ships and they cannot be loaded in time. The high price of 20-count Shuangma is 1,747 yuan, and the low price is 1,738 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon is 1,743 yuan, rising to 1,746 yuan, and the closing price is 1,740 yuan. At present, the yarn market cannot relax when thinking about itself. However, rumors are rife, which makes people even more divided.

Shuangma opened in the morning. Following yesterday's good popularity, the opening price was 1,745 yuan. After a while, it rose to 1,747 yuan. Later, it was heard that there were not many spot yarn transactions, and the shorts became active again. As for the opening of the exchange, it was soft and tired, and the market fell again to 1,738 yuan. However, foreign firms in Southeast Asia are purchasing, and there are transactions every day, and the selling price is very high, and people's hearts are revitalized. Large households bought in on the dip, and it rose again to 1,747 yuan. By the time of closing, it had eased back a step, and the price was 1,743 yuan. According to statistics, 9,100 bales were traded in half a day, all of which were traded by peers.

In the futures market for Golden Shuangma, the trend was winding in a dull atmosphere, and the market turned clear and idle. Because American cotton was tired and the news between countries was still expected to unfold, the exchange went up and down suddenly, making people uneasy and unable to rely on each other. Therefore, the large households, whose longs were in this mid-range market, had little intention of entering for a while, and the shorts were also concerned about changes in the environment, and there was even less activity, resulting in a lonely market, leading to a brewing trend. Therefore, the ups and downs were narrow, and the high and low prices of near and far periods only differed by seven or eight yuan. In the morning, the September period opened at 1,649 yuan, the October period at 1,660 yuan, and the November period at 1,677 yuan. In the middle of the journey, because the factory orders were tired, many floaters sold out, so the recent period once fell to 1,646 yuan, the October period fell to 1,657 yuan, and the November period fell to 1,673 yuan. By the time of the afternoon closing, it rebounded slightly. In the afternoon, it hovered, still tired after the initial settlement. The potential of buyers could not be strengthened, so it was taken advantage of by scattered shorts, so near the closing, the November period once again fell to 1,673 yuan, and it showed weakness. As a result, the September period was 1,649 yuan and 50 cents. Because it did not rise from yesterday, it was good by 5 yuan and 50 cents. The October period was 1,658 yuan and 50 cents, down 1 yuan and 50 cents. The November period was 674 yuan and 50 cents, also down 6 yuan and 50 cents. The opening and closing prices and high and low prices are listed on the left (net disk bid price).

### Autumn Rain and Autumn Wind Sadden the Cotton

The current cotton situation: coarse velvet is sought-after and the selling price is rising day by day. This is because the stock is becoming thinner, and secondly, the source is difficult. In addition, the domestic climate is humid, and the autumn wind and autumn rain are raging endlessly. The new cotton production has been greatly damaged. The future cotton market is unpredictable. At the same time, the need for fabrics in Southeast Asia is becoming more prosperous, and 23-count yarn is needed for spinning.

The New York cotton market plummeted due to the influence of the Washington news, the Secretary of the Treasury, Morgenthau, requested the release of government cotton and wheat, the public settled, and the Southern gangs' arbitrage was quite active. Although there was a slight rise in the middle due to short covering, it fell again later due to the weakness of New Orleans. As a result, the closing price fell by about 43-44 points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market is closed. It is predicted that the market will open about five rupees lower than yesterday.

The Shanghai cotton trade has turned flat again. This is probably due to the decline in American cotton and the influence of the public taking a wait-and-see attitude. There have not been many transactions in recent days. Yesterday, only Brazilian cotton had a small purchase intention, and the rest was slightly sluggish.

### Three Essential Elements for Calculating Yarn Costs: Machinery, Raw Materials, and Labor are Indispensable; 20-count Yarn Costs Approximately 1,600 Yuan

A former colleague, Mr. Someone, manager of a certain yarn company, upon seeing the yarn and cotton reports in the commercial news section of this newspaper, which mentioned the raw material price for spinning 20-count yarn as 350 to 380 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), with 3.5 dan of cotton needed per bale of yarn, plus miscellaneous opening and handling fees of 250 to 300 yuan, resulting in a factory cost of somewhere between 1,800 and 1,900 yuan (?), believed it was incorrect. He requested the author to rewrite a draft to provide a more accurate report to avoid misleading the public.

When discussing the current cost of 20-count cotton yarn, price factors are interconnected in many ways. First, the quality of the machinery (production tool) directly affects the production rate (high or low), thus indirectly impacting costs. For example, in the same yarn mill, both possessing 10,000 spindles, one uses new machinery (of recent age), and the other uses old machinery (of long age). The final production rates will differ significantly. New machines can produce 1.25 to 1.5 pounds of 20-count yarn per spindle per day and night, whereas old machines produce less than one pound, approximately 0.95 pounds. Thus, with the same 10,000 spindles, new machines can produce 12,000 to 15,000 pounds per day and night, while old machines produce only about 9,500 pounds, a difference of 3,000 to 5,000 pounds (the yarn production also differs by about ten bales), which can affect the cost. Second, the quality of cotton used matters. Using cotton with better fibers increases the cost, but it is actually cheaper than using cotton with poor fibers because less cotton is used and less waste is produced. Conversely, using more inferior cotton with more waste will increase costs. Third, personnel management is important. If workshop workers and staff can consciously conserve resources and save materials, the cost of each bale of yarn will be reduced significantly. Conversely, if workers and staff are careless, fail to conserve resources, and allow workers to waste materials, the cost will inevitably increase. Therefore, machinery, raw materials, and labor are the biggest factors affecting the cost of cotton yarn. Some require 355 jin (or even 360 jin) of cotton per bale, while others require only 346 to 347 jin, generally about 350 jin. Indian cotton (such as Amraoti and Panganga) accounts for 80%, and local cotton (such as Huo Ji) accounts for 20%. Indian cotton costs about 400 yuan per dan, and Huo Ji cotton costs about 300 yuan per dan. The combined average cotton cost is 380 yuan per dan. Using 350 jin of cotton, the total cotton cost is 1,330 yuan, plus opening and handling fees (including manufacturing costs, management fees, financial expenses, etc.) of 300 yuan (e.g., wages: 120 yuan, electricity: 70 yuan, materials: 60 yuan, interest, miscellaneous expenses, insurance, etc.: approximately 50 yuan). Thus, the total cost of one bale of 20-count cotton yarn is 1,630 yuan (even with some differences, it will not exceed 1,700 yuan). The market price is about 1,750 yuan, leaving the factory with a net profit of over 100 yuan per bale. Speculators can take this into consideration. (Long Ju)

Grain: August Survey; 400,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai; Yesterday's Rice Prices First Weakened, Then Strengthened

The import of foreign rice is reported daily in this newspaper, with monthly summaries published. Last month (August), a total of 400,456 bags of foreign rice arrived, including 200,717 bags from Hong Kong, 65,529 bags directly from Siam, 67,500 bags directly from Saigon, 30,000 bags directly from Rangoon, and 34,000 bags from the Dutch East Indies (Java). The Shanghai Municipal Council's fair-price foreign rice is also included in the above total.

Yesterday, the foreign rice market showed a fluctuating situation. The market opened in the morning carrying over the previous day's weakness. The atmosphere in the market was very peaceful. Not only did new bulls dare not take risks, but even those with goods in hand sought to sell them off. The market then declined sharply, continuing to fall. Small-package rice fell from 106 yuan to 104 yuan, and foreign warehouses even fell to 103 yuan, one or two yuan lower than the previous afternoon's low price. However, after the price fell, sellers were unwilling to sell at such low prices. Moreover, because the Municipal Council's selling price was still 117 yuan, 13 to 14 yuan higher than the market price, and although new contracts were available, the prices were slightly higher, speculative groups actively took advantage of the low prices to buy in. The market then recovered from its weakness. Small-package spot goods rose again to 106 to 107 yuan. Yinghua Silu goods once fell to 132 yuan. Spot goods in the general market, both original packages at 127 yuan and 129 yuan, were all lower than the previous opening by 1.5 to 3 or 4 yuan. Then the market sellers held firm, and prices were shouted higher again. Throughout the day, transactions ended with local speculators and hoarders hesitant to buy in large quantities due to rumors of peace. Transactions in spot goods were less than 10,000 bags, and only 300 to 400 tons of Yinghua Si.

The thick and thin japonica domestic rice market continued to see sluggish sales, making it difficult for holders to support prices. It followed foreign rice, dropping lower. Early japonica rice from Kainangang opened at 149 yuan and 147 yuan. Special japonica rice from Wuxi was at 151 yuan. As for new japonica rice from Pudong, due to cloudy and rainy weather, the arrival of goods was scarce, and holders were more willing to hold onto their stock, priced at 151 yuan to 150 yuan and 9 jiao.

Due to the continuous depreciation of other goods, people's minds were affected for glutinous rice, and both wholesale and retail appetite turned weak. Although market goods were scarce, market prices were difficult to maintain, falling by one or two yuan. Special white glutinous rice from Cha Fei opened at 126 to 127 yuan, with general market prices ranging from a high of 125 yuan plus a half to a low of 121 yuan. Glutinous green beans were at 111 to 112 yuan.

### Flour and Wheat Also Lack Vigor

In the atmosphere of strong peace rumors, the situation for foreign flour had been weakening and lifeless. Moreover, yesterday's report stated that flour had been included in the foreign exchange regulations for imported goods, enough to break the recent rumors that flour was not subject to foreign exchange restrictions. New hoarders refrained from action, and those with goods in hand were fearful and eager to sell, so the market became even weaker. Paohe opened at only 32 yuan and 1 jiao, and Golden Dragon also fell from 30 yuan and 7 jiao to 30 yuan and 5 jiao. Prices all saw a drop of two or three jiao. However, new contracts have not been agreed upon for a long time. Only a little over 100,000 bags were contracted in the middle of last month. Since the beginning of the month, foreign wheat merchants have been short-selling 3,000 tons of wheat to the factories. To this day, both deliveries are lacking, and Chinese factories have no durum wheat to supply, making it difficult to continue. Therefore, local flour has consistently stood at 34 yuan. Large wholesalers and hoarders are unwilling to sell, and flour prices have gradually rebounded as local speculators and new hoarders take advantage of the low prices to absorb supply. Paohe reached 32 yuan and 4 jiao, while Golden Dragon at foreign warehouses rose slightly to 30 yuan and 8 jiao. Nearly 20,000 bags were traded.

### Oil Market: Soap Factories Procure Raw Oil; Oil Prices Rebound After Falling

Yesterday's edible oil market situation initially fell and then rose. At first, influenced by the rumors of the previous day, people's minds were still not invigorated, and prices once again saw a drop of one or two yuan. Later, due to short sellers buying in at low prices and large customers from the yarn and cotton industry suddenly absorbing large quantities, the market situation changed from weak to firm, and prices rose across the board. As a result, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil rose by three to four yuan compared to the previous day. Statistics show that over 8,000 dans of clear oil from the Dayou Factory were sold for delivery in late September, with an opening price of 164 yuan and 5 jiao, a low of 161 yuan, and a closing and high of 168 yuan. Also, over 5,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua Factory had an opening price of 161 yuan and 5 jiao, a low of 160 yuan, and a high of 169 yuan, closing at 167 yuan. Additionally, local streets and soap factories procured 240 barrels of raw oil from Qingdao at a price of 170 yuan, and 500 cans of raw oil from Yantai at a price of 256 yuan.

Also, on the 11th, 470 bags of soybeans arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin, and 300 pieces of raw oil arrived from Qingdao.

Sugar Market: Over 90,000 Bags Arrive in Ten Days; Sugar Prices Decline

Recently, the Shanghai sugar market has been horizontal and difficult to rise, but the arrival of foreign sugar in Shanghai, as surveyed by this newspaper, is more prosperous than before. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jiangsu ship brought a large batch of granulated sugar from Hong Kong, totaling 11,709 bags, which were unloaded at the company's wharf in Pudong. According to the local association, the amount of foreign sugar arriving this month has already reached 93,975 bags, which is not a small amount, but sugar merchants continue to manipulate it. (Zu)

Yesterday's sugar market was initially loose, then tightened again. The company's futures for coarse white sugar for the 20th of the month were at 137 yuan and 5 jiao, gradually falling to 29 yuan and 3 jiao, then recovering to 31 yuan and 2 jiao, and in the afternoon, 31 yuan and 5 jiao, 32 yuan and 9 jiao, 8 jiao, and 6 jiao. For the 30th of the month, from 131 yuan and 6 jiao to 30 yuan and 6 jiao, it rebounded to 33 yuan and 3 jiao, and in the afternoon, 31 yuan and 7 jiao, 34 yuan and 2 jiao, 6 jiao, and 8 jiao. Spot market prices for August imports were at 132 yuan to 4 jiao, and in the afternoon, 33 yuan and 6 jiao. July was at 31 yuan and 7 jiao to 32 yuan, and in the afternoon, 33 yuan. June was at 131 yuan and 3 jiao, and in the afternoon, 33 yuan. May was at 30 yuan and 5 jiao, and in the afternoon, 32 yuan. Taikoo Car White B mark was at 160 yuan, later 5 jiao, and HX mark was at 142 yuan, all down by 1 yuan and 5 jiao. Car Red, due to small inventory and actual sales needs, H mark was at 118 yuan, uniquely up by 1 yuan. Dutch Red consignment goods were at 121 yuan, and spot goods at 22 yuan. The total transaction volume was over 45,000 bags in futures and over 5,000 bags in spot goods.

### Finance: Spot Gold Drops Another 100 Yuan; Futures May Change Course and Seek New Development

Yesterday, the gold market's last month's futures gold had rumors of seeking new development. It is said that since the black market may disappear and foreign exchange is pegged, the gold futures trading has lost its tool for speculation. What is lacking is a method of settlement. Originally, the gold auction settlement used British gold and Japanese gold, and then all used US dollars, which has been the practice for a long time. However, those who trade futures are not pegged to the US dollar and remain silent. There is a large territory within reach of today's occupied areas and the influence of the Japanese yen. Therefore, there are rumors that its ticket value may be used for settlement in Japanese yen. However, Japanese currency is not comparable to the Japanese gold of the past. Fortunately, today's futures gold market is not comparable to the old gold auction. It is said that yesterday's futures transactions were over 1,000 taels, mostly to close out trades. Supply exceeded demand, and the price had retreated to the 6,850 yuan level, and then dropped another 17 yuan. Spot gold is still falling amidst demand from various banks, having retreated within 8,900 yuan. In the morning, Tianyuan Jinde paid 200 taels and Decheng Jinxiang paid 50 taels at 9,000 yuan, 10 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Soon, it fell sharply. Zhongxing Decheng each sold 50 taels, Hesheng sold 60 taels, and Yongcheng Mingfeng each sold 20 taels, all bought by Chengyi. Yifeng sold 51 taels to Tianyuan, and Hesheng sold 10 taels to Xianghe. The price had retreated to 8,950 yuan. Chengda paid 20 taels to Decheng, and Xianghe paid 30 taels to Yifeng, rising to 8,970 yuan. Xiangxing Yong sold 20 taels to Chengyi, falling to 8,950 yuan. Xinfeng Yong paid 20 taels to Decheng Yifeng each, raising it to 8,970 yuan. Decheng sold 30 taels to Tianyuan, and Defu sold 10 taels to Hengji for 8,960 yuan. At noon, the selling pressure turned strong, and the decline was even sharper. Defu sold 50 taels and Xianghe sold 10 taels, both bought by Tianyuan. Lianxing sold 20 taels of De characters, and Mingfeng sold 10 taels of Xinfeng Yong, and Chengyi sold 20 taels of Hesheng, already falling to 8,900 yuan. Later, there was even more supply than demand. The initial opening in the afternoon was 70 yuan lower. Wanfeng Decheng each sold 10 taels to Chengyi, and Yongfeng sold 10 taels each to Chida Gongda, all for 8,830 yuan. Litai suddenly paid 20 taels to Yutai Feng and 10 taels to Yongcheng, all for 8,880 yuan, and then paid another 50 taels to Yifeng and 20 taels to Xianghe. Xianghe then paid another 30 taels each to Yifeng and Decheng, all for 8,890 yuan. Finally, Chengyi sold 20 taels to Litai for 8,880 yuan, 100 yuan lower than the previous day, with a difference of 170 yuan in high and low. The selling price of gold coins from Jinhao was 8,950 yuan, with a reduction of 200 yuan for buying back. Jewelry gold was also reduced by 10 yuan, totaling 910 yuan.

Futures Prices Fall Step by Step

The October futures for each bar (ten taels) opened at 9:15 AM. Jufeng Yong sold 50 taels to Tianyuan at a price of 6,870 yuan. Xianghe Yifeng tried to sell forcefully, shouting over 6,875 yuan, but no deal was made. Later, it fell to 6,862 yuan, and Xinfeng Yong bought in. It was stable at noon, and the market closed at 6,865 yuan. The afternoon opening at 2 PM was 6,865 yuan. Dafeng sold 100 taels to Xinfeng Yong for 6,860 yuan. Later, at 3:25 PM, Deda Chida suddenly sold, and it fell another 7 yuan, closing at 6,853 yuan, 17 yuan lower than the previous day, with a difference of 17 yuan in high and low.

Jewelry Gold Drops Another Ten Yuan

The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael at silver shops was reduced by ten yuan at 11:30 AM, to 910 yuan, with a reduction of 50 yuan for buying back, it is said.

### Black Market Remains Quiet

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the central bank and HSBC post the same rates. HSBC's small price for British gold was 3 pence 15625, and US dollars was 5 yuan 3125. Normal commercial settlements saw no applications throughout the day. It is said that most import and export foreign firms will still have to entrust brokers to buy and sell on their behalf. The bull and bear US dollar rates in the black market still cannot be aligned with the market prices agreed upon by both the banks. The Stabilization Fund has not given any instructions, and it may deliver on expiry and sell to importers of general non-essential goods. The market price is still about 2 pence 859375 for British gold and 4 yuan 84375 for US dollars. It is heard that a certain Chinese merchant in this city has a deposit of 50,000 US dollars in the United States, priced at 5 yuan 375 and 34375, allocated to the Central Bank as a national currency deposit account.

Hong Kong, 11th (Thursday) - This morning, the exchange market opened with unusual stability. The spot rate for the Central Bank opened at 465 yuan, the spot rate for the Japanese exchange has not been opened yet, and there were no gains or losses for the rest.

Tianjin, 11th (Thursday) - This morning, the exchange market opened steadily. The London telegraphic transfer was tightened by 125, to 3 pence 125. The New York telegraphic transfer was reduced by 25, to 5 yuan 125. The Central Bank exchange rate was lowered by 2 yuan and 5 jiao, to 90 yuan and 5 jiao. The "United Currency" dark market returned cheaply by 1 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen, to 5 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen.

### Securities: Foreign Stocks Rise More Sharply; Domestic Debt Rebounds Slightly

The OTC market for public bonds rebounded slightly yesterday after several days of continuous gains. All bonds rebounded by about six or seven jiao. The market saw floating longs exiting to take profits, while large bull positions remained unmoved. The market has reached its peak, and a small number of jiao were a matter of course. The overall trend still needs to be shifted depending on the environmental situation. At present, it may be a few more jiao, but in the end there is no large or small side. It is not easy for C-type to break the one-yuan barrier. In the morning, Jiucheng Hao absorbed quite a bit, so C-type still opened outside of two yuan. Later, Zhongfu Runde Tiansheng Yongchang sold out, although Lianhe Dazhong Runli still had some interest, but the selling pressure was still heavy, and it was pressed down by two or three jiao. The noon closing was two, three, and four jiao lower. Trading was quiet in the afternoon. Yongchang bought back a little, and Tongshun added a little more. Jiucheng, which had entered in the morning, reappeared in the afternoon. Lianyi Hongda also exited, and the market fell another two or three jiao in the afternoon. As a result, they all eased back by five and a half to seven jiao. The transaction volume was estimated to be about 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

In stock trading, 100 shares of Zhongnan Bank were traded at a price of 140 yuan.

The rise in the public utility stock market has intensified, people's minds have always been good, and sellers' chips are clearly lacking, so many kinds continue to create new highs. In the industrial stock market, Yihua Steel Industry, Ken Zhi and the shares of various silver companies are particularly strong among buyers. In the rubber stock market, British Chazha, British Yinda District Rubber Trust and Rubber and other varieties are the most popular.

London, 10th (Wednesday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East company stocks remained stable. Only the shares of McCallig Bank rose by one shilling and three pence, with a price of nine pounds, six shillings, and three pence. There were no other changes.

### Evolution of Check Clearing

The Shanghai Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee has decided to change the check clearing system starting on the 15th of this month. This process is quite memorable. Before January 1933, the clearing of checks between Chinese commercial banks in this city was done by drawing notes and entrusting them to money shops for clearing. Since the establishment of the Japanese Bank Check Clearing House in January 1933, checks between commercial banks have been directly exchanged and cleared. At that time, a total of 32 banks joined the exchange. The business of the clearing house has become increasingly developed. As of recently, a total of 37 banks have joined the exchange, as well as more than 70 branches, 14 entrusted agent exchange banks, and more than 100 banks that have opened transactions with the clearing house and entrusted it to collect checks. At present, most of the receipts and payments for the entire year's check funds have been concentrated in the clearing house. Recently, due to factual needs and to unify procedures, the clearing house has uniformly changed the check clearing system to a collection method. On the clearing house's side, the handling procedures can be unified. On the side of each exchange bank, there is no need to send exchange staff to the clearing house every day to handle check exchange matters. As for the money industry, the inter-industry check clearing has been using a public order system for a year. Due to the trend of the times, it has been changed to a "difference report form" system since June of this year. The method is that Bank A receives a check submitted by a customer payable to Bank B. Bank A uses an "Interbank Receipt Notice" to specify the number of checks and the amount, and together with the checks, sends a staff member to Bank B. After Bank B counts and confirms that there are no errors, they give the original staff member back a "Interbank Receipt Receipt". After the checks are mutually collected among the banks on the same day, each bank fills in a "Difference Report Form" stating the amount it received today, the amount it paid today, and the words "net receipt today" or "net payment today", and reports to the money treasury, and transfers the funds to the money treasury based on the document. Therefore, check clearing matters, banks are concentrated in the check clearing house, and money shops are concentrated in the money treasury. Now that both industries are implementing improved check clearing matters due to the needs of their businesses, the development of the two industries can be expected. (Ying Yongyu)

### Hawkins and McKay Convene Financial Conference Yesterday; 14 Allied Banks Attended; Discuss Implementation of Foreign Exchange Supply Measures; Shanghai Market Prices Expected to Turn Around After Supply of Foreign Exchange for Necessities

After the General Manager of McCallig Bank, Hawkins, and the Supervisor of the Hua Tu Bank, McKay, returned to Shanghai on the President Cleveland, sources responsible for the matter revealed that the two would hold a meeting with senior officials of 14 banks in the city to make an important decision on the foreign exchange problem in Shanghai. Although Hawkins and McKay did not meet with the American member Fox in Hong Kong, they had lengthy discussions with other members while in Hong Kong. Therefore, the problems discussed at the Shanghai banking community meeting convened after their return to Shanghai were mostly about the implementation of the new measures. The purpose was to determine the relationship between the 14 banks and their clients, as well as the relationship between Chinese commercial banks. According to information received as of press time, this meeting was held at 2 PM yesterday afternoon. A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inquired with a senior official of McCallig Bank about whether there were any new developments after Mr. Hawkins returned to Shanghai. It was said that in addition to the announced trial measures for September and the two lists of permitted import items, there were no other changes. However, it was revealed that foreign banks are determined to cooperate effectively with the Equalization Fund, and will never buy or sell black market exchange rates thereafter.

The Four Banks Started Handling Foreign Exchange Business Yesterday

According to reliable information obtained by a Da Zhong News Agency reporter, the Shanghai branches of the four banks, including Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China, have started handling the foreign exchange business specially approved by the Equalization Fund, just like foreign banks, since receiving the order. Therefore, the situation in the foreign exchange sector of each bank was very busy yesterday morning. The specific foreign exchange supply measures and application forms were issued at the same time as the official order. The documents received included the trial measures for the specially approved foreign exchange banks in September, and a copy of the two lists of permitted import items, as well as two types of printed English forms: one is an application form to the Equalization Fund for the supply of foreign exchange, and the other is a letter from the bank to the Equalization Fund. As to when the four banks will start handling foreign exchange application business for other Chinese commercial banks, the order did not involve it. It is said that "There is indeed a resolution for the four banks to handle foreign exchange application business for other Chinese commercial banks, but it has not yet been finalized. As it stands, it can be implemented. This is purely an obligation on the part of the four banks, and the commission should be returned to the Chinese commercial bank entrusting the handling."

### Slightly Corrected Application Items

Regarding the application procedures, the original prepared forms were in triplicate. It is understood that an additional copy must be added in the future, making it quadruplicate. The triplicate is submitted to the Equalization Fund, and one copy is kept by the applicant bank. The name of the application form and items 3, 4, 5, and 9 of the old ten items have been slightly corrected. The name of the old form was "Application Form for Purchasing Foreign Exchange from the Equalization Fund," and it has now been corrected to "Application Form for Requesting Supply of Foreign Exchange from the Equalization Fund." Item 3, "Total Amount of Foreign Exchange Sold," has been corrected to "Total Amount of Foreign Exchange Requested." Item 4, "Date and Type of Foreign Exchange Sold to Importers," has been corrected to "Type of Foreign Exchange Requested by Importers." Item 5, "Type B," has been corrected to "Type B and Quantity." Item 9, "Remarks," has been added with "Approximate Date of Shipment."

### Shanghai Market Prices Expected to Turn Around

Yesterday, a reporter from New Voice News Agency inquired with informed sources on their opinions on the issue of Shanghai market prices. The conclusions obtained were extremely consistent and concrete, believing that the prospects for Shanghai market prices are promising. Since the Equalization Fund Committee instructed the designated banks in Shanghai to handle the supply of foreign exchange for necessities, market prices have tended to decline. There are five direct and indirect reasons: (1) Chinese legal tender has a more solid foundation and a stronger value due to the support of friendly countries such as Britain and the United States, and the exchange rate set by the Equalization Fund increases the purchasing power of legal tender, causing market prices to fall. (2) The scope of the foreign exchange supply items determined by the Equalization Fund Committee is broad, allowing importers to obtain foreign exchange at favorable prices. Therefore, the prices of all items approved for foreign exchange settlement can be lower than before, especially for essential items such as rice, kerosene, coal, food, raw materials, sugar, wheat, grain products, and flour, which can be settled at low exchange rates. This is the main reason for the decline in market prices. (3) The Municipal Council's port rice will hardly rise in the future, at least enough to prevent other market prices from continuing to rise, and the authorities of the two concessions have recently resolved to crack down on illegal price increases, so speculative merchants have to worry. (4) The convenience of ship transportation has gradually improved recently, and foreign traffic has also become slightly smoother, so that freight transportation is not interrupted, which has a great impact on suppressing market prices. (5) The situation in Shanghai is no longer as tense as it was in the middle and lower sentences of last month, people's minds are becoming more stable, the trend of purchasing a large number of goods in advance has stopped, and merchants have no opportunity to take advantage of, so market prices may fall back.

### Executive Yuan Discusses Internal Transfer of Floating Capital

According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing on the 10th, the Executive Yuan is currently inviting experts to study what subtle ways to transfer the floating capital in Shanghai internally. However, there are no reliable statistics on the exact amount of this floating capital. However, according to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun published the day before yesterday, the total deposits of banks in this city at the end of 1936, before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, totaled 150 billion yuan in Chinese currency. By the end of last year, it had increased to 285 billion yuan in Chinese currency, resulting in a phenomenon where banks do not pay interest on deposits but instead charge handling fees.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Intends to Implement Price Limits on Coal Balls

It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council will form a new committee within a few days to set the price of coal balls in the Public Concession. The committee may have seven members, who will first study the situation of coal balls and then make recommendations to the Bureau on setting the price of coal balls. The establishment of this committee is in response to the request of coal companies, applying for the Bureau to assist in solving the problem of coal ball prices here. The price of coal balls has risen sharply in the past few months.

### The Perilous Yellow Sea: Yacht Lost at Sea, Two Young Men Barely Escape with Their Lives

This newspaper reported on the 10th of this month, translating news from the "North-China Daily News," that a Swedish sailor was attempting a daring voyage from Shanghai to Manila in an old yacht named Ella, harboring grand plans of crossing the Pacific Ocean by a small boat. According to the Shanghai Times, the yacht was struck by a huge wave and sank in the Yangtze River, eighty miles from Shanghai. Only the two young Scandinavian sailors, Jakobsen and Hansen, both skilled swimmers, managed to avoid becoming food for the fish. They arrived in the central district of the city the day before yesterday afternoon, enjoying a hearty meal at a restaurant, their first in four days. Their account of the ordeal follows:

Water Heroes, Only Eighteen

Jakobsen is Swedish and Hansen is Danish. Both are eighteen years old and have considered themselves seasoned sailors since they were fifteen. Five months ago, they arrived in Shanghai on a Norwegian ship and decided to stay. Within these five months, they saved enough money to purchase the yacht Ella. The yacht was already forty-seven years old, with a weak keel and an unstable rudder. Some warned them that while the yacht might be able to sail in the Huangpu River, it would not withstand the pounding of raging waves on a voyage to Manila. However, the two dismissed the warnings with a laugh, renaming the yacht "Ella the Adventure." Even before setting sail, they encountered unfavorable circumstances. When a typhoon passed over Shanghai, the yacht collided with other ships, damaging its side. Two nights before leaving Shanghai, it was also burgled. Blankets, pajamas, a water tank, and some equipment vanished without a trace. Customs officials even warned them of potential interception by the Japanese along the way. However, the two disregarded these concerns and finally set sail at 6 AM on the 7th of this month.

Rudder Detached, Water Pours In, Impossible to Steer

That day, they smoothly exited the port at noon and entered the Yangtze River. Unexpectedly, the strong wind died down, and a powerful tide surged up. The small boat was carried back to the Wusongkou with the tide. They set sail again at 3 PM, and things were calm. On the morning of the 8th, the boat entered the Yellow Sea and immediately seemed fragile, repeatedly struck by huge waves. The rudder gradually detached from the stern, and seawater started to leak in. By noon, the water inside the boat had accumulated significantly. They tried their best to bail it out, but they could not completely remove the water from the boat. It was also impossible to repair the rudder, and the sea became increasingly turbulent. They decided to return to Shanghai. Just as they entered the Yangtze River, within two miles of the shore, the small boat could no longer hold up. The rudder completely detached from the stern, and river water poured into the boat even faster, causing it to sink. The two barely escaped with their lives. In the swift current, they took off their clothes, leaving only their underwear, and swam towards the shore. However, they were swept away by the current and could only swim parallel to the shore. After struggling for two hours in the constantly rising and falling waves, they were exhausted and finally managed to crawl ashore about two and a half miles from where the boat sank.

Exhausted Landing, Fortunately Surviving

They walked inland a little and came across a small village. The villagers were shocked by the bedraggled appearance of the two men. The incident was reported to the Japanese officer stationed in the village, who suspected them of being spies. They were taken to the barracks and interrogated in detail. Jakobsen wrote a note, which was sent by a Japanese soldier to the Swedish consulate in Shanghai. They were detained in the camp for two days. On the 10th at noon, they were escorted by Japanese soldiers and taken by train to a place in Pudong, where they were handed over to the care of the Swedish consulate staff. Only then were they able to change clothes and return to Shanghai.

### Jianghai Customs Restricts the Import of French Currency

The Jianghai Customs in this city has placed restrictions on the import of French currency. The limit for those arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong is 1,500 Imperial dollars. Anything exceeding this limit will be confiscated. However, if the currency is shipped through customs from Xiamen, Shantou, Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and other places, the amount can reach up to 10,000 dollars. The ships used for this type of shipment must sail directly to Shanghai and are not allowed to call at other ports. It is uncertain when or how these restrictions may change.

### Japanese Fleet Commander Koga Arrives in Shanghai

Rear Admiral Shimada Shigetaro, commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, has recently been transferred to the position of commander of the Yokosuka Naval District in Japan. The vacant position of commander of the fleet stationed in China has been filled by Vice Admiral Koga Mineichi, as announced by the Japanese Ministry of the Navy. It is reported that Koga arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese liaison ship Nagasaki Maru at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday (the 10th), landing at the Yangshupu Wharf. At that time, the Japanese authorities in this city implemented special security measures at the wharf, temporarily cutting off traffic.

### British Consul Accompanied by Chairman of the Municipal Council Visits U.S. Consul General for General Observations, Important Discussions Expected

According to foreign news reports, at 10 AM the day before yesterday, the British Consul General in Shanghai, George, unexpectedly visited the U.S. Consulate General on Jiangxi Road, accompanied by Liddell, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. They were received by the U.S. Consul General, Lockhart, and had a lengthy discussion until about 11 AM before departing. General observers believe that the discussion between the two Consuls General must have involved important matters.

### U.S. Destroyer Henderson Still Not Seen, President Cleveland Returns to the U.S. Yesterday, Did Not Carry Any Cargo on This Trip

Rumors have been circulating recently that the U.S. Presidential Liner has been ordered to evacuate overseas Chinese, and that the destroyer Henderson has also arrived in Shanghai. According to investigations: (1) Fewer than one hundred American citizens left Shanghai on the President Cleveland last night. All of them voluntarily left Shanghai due to personal reasons and had nothing to do with the evacuation of overseas Chinese. (2) The destroyer Henderson did not arrive in Shanghai yesterday. Details are as follows:

President Cleveland Arrives Empty

The U.S. President Line's President Cleveland sailed directly from the U.S. to Luzon, via Hong Kong, arriving in Shanghai at around 4 PM the day before yesterday (the 10th) and berthed at buoys 12 and 13. It was scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to the U.S. at midnight yesterday, as reported in previous newspapers. It has been learned that the company also has the mail ship President Taylor and two cargo ships, SS James Rykes and SS Zsella Rykes, which arrived in Shanghai one after another yesterday. The President Cleveland carried a large amount of cargo to the Philippines from the U.S., but no cargo for this city. There was also no American wheat. However, the cargo for the U.S. from this city was congested. Passengers returning to the U.S. on the mail ship, including American naval officers withdrawing from Japan, totaled more than 110 people. The President Taylor will set sail south tonight. Another cargo ship has been slightly delayed due to loading and unloading cargo.

Henderson's Whereabouts Unknown

According to information from the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Navy transport ship Henderson was expected to arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of this month, but there has been no news of it so far. As of last night, it had not arrived. The report yesterday that the battleship had arrived in Shanghai at 4 PM the day before yesterday was completely inaccurate. The exact date of the ship's arrival in Shanghai is still unknown.

Seven Foreign Warships in Port

The number of foreign warships anchored in the Huangpu River has recently increased. According to reports from the Daguan News Agency, there are currently seven foreign warships in the Huangpu River. The U.S. ship Luzon is anchored at the British naval buoy. The French ships Grogner, Belair, and Voleg are anchored off the French Avenue Bund and Gaochangmiao. The Italian ships Eritrea, Carlotto, and Lepanto are anchored at buoys 20, 21, and 1 and 2.

Indian Nationals Delayed, Left Shanghai Last Night

The Jardine Matheson's Taishun, which arrived in Shanghai to transport Indian nationals back to their home country, was originally scheduled to set sail on the 10th. However, due to a slight delay in the embarkation of some Indian nationals, it was postponed until 6 PM yesterday before departing for Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, Calcutta, and other places. It is estimated that dozens of Indian nationals from this city boarded the ship to return home, most of whom are relatives of Indian police officers in the Municipal Council, as they have no need to reside in Shanghai. Very few of them are women and children. One gray-haired Indian national, who has lived in China for more than 20 years, was overcome with emotion at the prospect of leaving Shanghai and returning home. When the ship set sail, several Indian police officers rushed to the Rossieford Wharf to bid farewell to their relatives. The ship also carried more than 2,000 cases of Jardine Matheson beer to India.

French Ships Resume Japan Route

According to news from the French Postal Shipping Company yesterday, the company's Kindia will sail directly from Shanghai to Yokohama, Japan, on the 17th of this month. After loading cargo, it will sail to Vietnam. French ships have suspended voyages to Japanese ports for several months. Now that they have decided to resume the route, other ships may continue to sail to Japanese ports. The Bena Saint Pierre, which previously carried more than 4,000 tons of coal from Haiphong, is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Haiphong tomorrow and will continue to carry coal to Shanghai.

Izumo Departs Shanghai

The Japanese flagship Izumo, which has been anchored in the Huangpu River for a long time near the China Merchants dock, raised its fire and prepared to sail yesterday morning. It left the Huangpu River at around 9 AM and exited the Wusongkou around 11 AM. Its destination is unknown.

### Shanghai West Tax and Vehicle License Matters Still Under Negotiation

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the negotiations between the Municipal Council and the City Center District are expected to be completed soon. After that, all vehicles traveling on roads outside the Shanghai West boundary will be required to display licenses from the City Center District. Regarding this matter, Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, told reporters that the negotiations have not yet concluded, so he could not comment. It is reported that Fessenden continued the discussions on Tuesday, discussing the license fees and taxes in the area outside the Shanghai West boundary. Some believe that the current negotiations may conclude at the beginning of next month.

### Fuzhou Water and Electricity Not Yet Restored

On the 3rd of this month, the Chinese army successively recaptured the key points of Fuzhou and Mawei. People from Fujian Province in Shanghai are eager to telegraph their hometowns to inquire about the current situation. According to the American Commercial Wireless Telegraph Company, the company has received too many telegrams between Shanghai and Fujian recently and is unable to send and receive them all at once. It will not be able to resume normal operations until it has processed them in a few days. The Datung and Great Northern Telegraph lines have not yet started sending and receiving due to a temporary lack of organization. It is said that the period will not be too far off.

### Preferential Treatment for Prisoner Mail

Mail and packages sent to French prisoners of war during the war were previously stipulated to be forwarded free of charge through Indochina. Now, letters and packages sent to prisoners of other nationalities can also be received and sent without postage. The procedure is the same as for sending to French prisoners. The post office has notified foreign senders in this city to pay attention.

### Renewal of Rickshaw Driver Licenses

The Public Concession of the Shanghai Municipal Council has announced the scheduled renewal of licenses for rickshaw drivers, as the licenses are about to expire. The original text reads: "Notice is hereby given that the licenses of rickshaw drivers will soon expire and should be renewed from October 1 of this year to September 30, 1942.

### Applications for Scholarships Difficult to Approve: Those Unemployed and Those Who Submit Late Applications Are Truly Beyond Help, Please Be Understanding and Forgiving

The Shanghai Women's Christian Association's scholarship program for industrial and commercial employees closed applications on the 5th of this month, and the list of students approved for scholarships has been fully announced. However, many more industrial and commercial employees have continued to send letters of application in recent days, which is difficult to respond to individually. To avoid disappointing those who have sent letters, we are providing a general response. The association has repeatedly announced the application deadline. We sympathize with the enthusiasm for learning of those who have lost their schooling, but we cannot help but feel regret for those who have not followed the established procedures, especially those who have submitted late applications despite their strong desire for knowledge. Those involved in handling various procedures must abide by the regulations of the committee. Therefore, we can only regretfully be unable to help those who have submitted late applications. In addition, there are also those who have only sent letters requesting scholarships without even picking up and filling out application forms. Even if they had not submitted late applications, they would still be in violation of the procedures, let alone now that the application period has ended. In addition, there are more than 200 unemployed and out-of-school individuals who have sent letters applying for scholarships. The association also deeply understands that the pain of being unemployed and out of school is undoubtedly greater than that of industrial and commercial employees who have lost their schooling. Those who have not been approved, because the industrial and commercial group stipulates that proof from a store, firm, manager, or person in charge is a necessary condition, cannot be changed. We hope that those who have submitted late applications and those who are unemployed will be understanding and forgiving.

### Scholarship Payment Needed Quickly

As of yesterday, more than 30 industrial and commercial scholarship recipients had not yet claimed their payments. In addition, many students changed schools yesterday and have now completed the procedures. They can come to the business department of this newspaper between 2 PM and 5 PM this afternoon to claim their scholarships, so that this newspaper can complete the settlement procedures as soon as possible.

Tang Jianxing, originally at Meng Xianying College, has changed to Cambridge English College due to inconvenient class times. A scholarship of 22 dollars has been approved.

Qiu Fuchun, Dai Xinyue, and Wang Xinming, originally at the China Vocational Supplementary School, have changed to Dalu English College due to conflicting class and work times. Replacement checks have been issued, and the scholarships remain the same. The original three checks have been returned.

Shen Jinlong, Xiao Yunxun, and Xia Keyu, originally at the Yada Wireless Radio School, have all changed to the Fifth China Supplementary School because the evening classes were full. Scholarships have been approved for Shen (24 dollars), Xiao (12 dollars), and Xia (12 dollars). The previous checks have been returned.

You Zhongqiu has changed to Shoujian Chinese Stenography School. A scholarship of 22 dollars has been approved. The previous check has been returned.

Feng Erqing, a scholarship of 10 dollars for the Textile Dyeing Industry School has been reissued.

Xu Qinfang, a scholarship of 60 dollars for the Hudong Gongshe Automobile School (Repair Department) has been reissued.

### Lu Xun's Thirty Years Collection

— Yulin

It has been five years since the death of Mr. Lu Xun. His fighting spirit remains in the world and is expanding more widely, deeply rooted in the hearts of young people. Mr. Guo Moruo said: "Before Lu Xun, there was no Lu Xun; after Lu Xun, there are countless Lu Xun." Lu Xun was truly great. Indeed, Lu Xun's era was a most oppressive era, a transition period between light and darkness. As a righteous intellectual, he clearly marked this page of history with his pen. He did not see the current national liberation war, but his driving force has guided thousands upon thousands of Chinese youth. His epic "In my dreams, I vaguely recall my mother's tears, on the city walls, the kings change banners" will forever exist as an immortal masterpiece of the era's literature and art. His sharp essays are also models in the fighting camp. Some say that he inherited the ideological form of Gong Ding'an. This is an ideological interpretation. He is truly the Chinese Maxim Gorky.

He was the most unique warrior in feudal and capitalist societies. He never lagged behind and always stood at the forefront of the era.

The Lu Xun Commemorative Committee, at this time and place, after printing "The Complete Works of Lu Xun," is continuing its efforts by publishing "Lu Xun's Thirty Years Collection" to commemorate this great man. The spirit is admirable.

The publication of Lu Xun's Thirty Years of Creative Works in 1941 is a very meaningful commemoration.

The name "Thirty Years Collection" refers to all of Mr. Lu Xun's writings from 1906 to 1936. The content includes: creative novels such as "Call to Arms" and "Wandering"; prose poems such as "Wild Grass"; and "Grave," "Supplement," "Remnants," etc., which contain classical Chinese, vernacular, poetry, and other texts. They are spicy, sincere, and appear in the cultural field in the form of throwing spears and daggers, with a distinctive style. He was the pioneer of essays of this era, from "Hot Wind" to "Qiejieting Essays," forming a great work of more than ten volumes. The spirit throughout is consistent, with the goal of revitalizing the nation and exposing the darkness. Other correct arrangements for ancient novels and old literature can be seen in his compilation and editing of "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction," "An Outline History of Han Literature," "Gou Chen of Ancient Novels," "Ji Kang's Collection," and so on. According to statistics, there are a total of 29 books, totaling 30 volumes.

As early as 1936, it is said that Mr. Lu Xun intended to compile and print this collection himself, but unfortunately he fell ill and died, and did not live to see it completed. Now, with the love and encouragement of people in the cultural circle and the enthusiastic efforts of the gentlemen of the Lu Xun Complete Works Publishing House, it has been decided to start pre-ordering this September and publish the book on schedule in October.

It is said that the table of contents of the collection will be arranged in chronological order of the works. During the four years from 1929 to 1932, Mr. Lu Xun devoted himself to the introduction of translations of social science works, etc., and had no time to take care of the printing of his own works. Regrettably, in the tenth item of the second catalog of the Thirty Years Collection drafted by Mr. Lu Xun himself, there is "Three Books on the Awakening of Faith" without specifying its meaning, which may include "Ji Kang's Collection," "Xie Cheng's Later Han Book," and "Ling Biao Lu Yi," but the latter two have not been seen to this day. Fortunately, this publication also includes "An Outline History of Han Literature" and "Miscellaneous Collections of Ancient Books from Kuaiji Prefecture," and the amount of "Remnants from the Collection" is even more substantial than expected.

It is difficult to reprint "The Complete Works of Lu Xun," and the ones available on the market are priced extremely high. The publication of "Lu Xun's Thirty Years Collection" is undoubtedly a good opportunity for readers. We can wait and see.

### Million Dollar Cash Seized, Nine Passengers Arrested

It is said that several days ago, someone attempted to smuggle 1 million National dollars into Shanghai in the furnace room of Jardine Matheson's Taishun, which sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai. It was discovered and confiscated by customs officers. Another account says that more than 800,000 National dollars were also seized at the same wharf from the company's Dingsheng, which arrived at the same time. However, according to a sudden report from the News Agency yesterday, when a certain ship arrived in port a few days ago, customs officers seized a huge sum of 1 million dollars in cash on board the ship. At the same time, police officers from the French Concession arrested nine passengers who were privately carrying the huge sum. The investigation is still underway. It is reported that the huge sum of cash was used to speculate on foreign exchange and other illicit gains.

### Attempted Kidnapping, Three Robbers Arrested, Rickshaw Driver Escapes

The owner of the Wanfengxiang Customs Brokerage, surnamed Qin, at No. 15 Shenxin Lane, Zilai Street, French Concession, was suddenly visited by three uninvited guests at 8:45 PM last night. All of them were wearing gray long gowns and pulled out a pistol, attempting to kidnap him. Fortunately, Qin was alert and signaled to an apprentice, who sneaked out of the back door to a neighbor and borrowed a phone to report to the Maitland Police Station. A large number of detectives rushed to the scene. A robber's car was parked in the lane. The driver, realizing that the plot had been exposed, quickly drove away without a trace. All three robbers were arrested on the spot, and a pistol was seized. They were detained in the police station for investigation.

### Employee of Ryan & Co. Commits Fraud and Obtains Money, Jiang Xuelong Arrested

Ryan & Co. at No. 461 Avenue Joffre had previously rented a vacant lot on Route Courbet to build several city houses and advertised for rent. Unexpectedly, Jiang Xuelong (31 years old, residing at No. 2 Lane 248, Fuli Road), a local employee of the company, took advantage of his position to defraud Huang Guande, manager of the Lafayette Theater, of 500 dollars in down payments and gratuities, as well as Huang Yuwen at No. 1 Lane 4, Chunwu Lane, Route Hodebert, of 2,340 dollars in down payments and gratuities, Yang Bingyi at No. 1894 Jing'an Temple Road of 576 dollars in down payments and gratuities, and Shen Weijia at No. 100 Renji Road of 576 dollars in down payments and gratuities. He forged the name and handwriting of Ryan, the manager of the company, and issued receipts. After a long time, because there were no houses to deliver, the parties directly contacted Ryan & Co. and realized that they had been deceived by Jiang. They reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Jiang. During the interrogation, Jiang admitted to the fraud and forging of receipts. The police chief charged Jiang with both fraud and forging private documents. To ensure that no one else had been deceived and harmed, he ordered him to be detained for further investigation to determine if he had committed any other crimes before proceeding with the case. It is reported that Jiang used this method to defraud a total of tens of thousands of dollars.

### The Ministry of Education Has Specifically Issued "Notes on Implementing People's Education," Those Who Fail to Implement Effectively Will Have Their National Education Funding Appropriately Reduced

(Chongqing Aviation News) In May of this year, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to various places to inspect the people's education section of central primary schools and national schools. According to the reports of various inspectors, the people's education sections of central primary schools and national schools in various places mostly did not comply with the principles promulgated by the Ministry. Therefore, the "Notes on Implementing People's Education Section in Various Schools" were re-formulated and issued to the relevant departments, requiring them to earnestly implement the various points in the Ministry's promulgated notes. The method is recorded below: Notes on Implementing People's Education Section in Central Schools and National Schools in Various Provinces and Cities: (1) Central schools and national schools established in various provinces since the first semester of the 30th year must set up a people's education section, mainly to operate senior and junior adult classes and women's classes. (2) In order to effectively supervise the operation of the people's education sections of various schools, various provinces and cities should intensify publicity work to correct the past views of school faculty and staff and people in society that neglect adult supplementary education. (3) In order to facilitate the enrollment of students in the people's education sections of various schools, various provinces and cities should formulate compulsory enrollment measures in accordance with the provisions of Chapter VII of the National Education Implementation Outline promulgated by the Ministry and implement compulsory enrollment. (4) The education administrative organs of various provinces and cities should formulate measures for rewarding and punishing central schools and national schools for operating the people's education section and submit them to the Ministry for record and implementation. (5) Central schools and national schools in various provinces should designate one of the original teachers to serve as the director of the people's education section, responsible for planning and managing the school's adult education and supervision matters. (6) After the expenses of the people's education section of central schools and national schools in various provinces and cities are included in the budget, they must absolutely not be diverted. (7) National schools should set up mobile teaching classes in sparsely populated or scattered villages. (8) From the 30th year onwards, if the subordinate central schools and national schools in various provinces and cities still do not have a people's education section, and it is verified by the inspectors of the Ministry, in addition to giving the person in charge appropriate punishment, the Ministry of Education will also consider reducing the central government's subsidy to the national education funds of the province or city. (9) The education administrative organs of various provinces and cities should, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the National Education Implementation Outline promulgated by the Ministry, quickly complete the survey of the number of illiterate people in the subordinate localities and compile statistical tables and submit them to the Ministry for review.

### Western Football Club Annual Meeting Decides to Set Up a Separate Chinese League, It is Said that the Police Authorities Oppose Sino-Western Football Matches, Registration Deadline Postponed, New Officers Elected Yesterday

The Shanghai Western Football Club held its annual meeting yesterday at the Sichuan Road Engineer's Association, and passed the secretary's report of the previous session and the accounting statements, and elected the officers for this session. The most important proposal was the issue of Chinese teams participating in this year's competition. Since the Yiyuan incident in the spring, the French Concession Police Department has prohibited football matches. In order to avoid the recurrence of accidental incidents, it is said that the police authorities of the two concessions still do not allow Chinese and Western teams to hold competitions. Therefore, the following decision was made on the issue of Chinese teams participating in yesterday's annual meeting:

Separate Chinese Group Because many Chinese teams participated in this year's competition, and the police authorities oppose Chinese and Western teams holding competitions, it was decided to set up a separate Chinese league group, and the registration period will be extended to the 25th of this month. The Shanghai Western Football Club is willing to do its best to help this competition be established.

Re-election of New Officers Captain Li Te, the president of the previous session, was elected as a lifetime member of the Western Club. Li Min will soon take leave and leave Shanghai. The list of other new officers is as follows: President Capez, Vice Presidents Cowart, Marshall, Xu, Ackison, Wei Chang Pei Long, Bu Tuo, Forbes, Pesoes, Reis, Appeals Committee Bu Li Qi, Bowei Er, Kliefert, Ge Si, Yue Xiu Rong, League Management Committee Cowart, Marshall, Pesoes, Edward, Kim Bo, Faras, School Group Reis, Spike, McCotai, Secretary Still Spike.

### Handicap Basketball, Division Champions Produced, Shanghai Star and Tongren Starting the Finals Tomorrow

The second Handicap Basketball Championship, after more than two months of competition, came to an end yesterday afternoon. The champions of Divisions One and Two were also produced at the same time yesterday. The champion of Division One originally belonged to Qianghua, but since Qianghua was the host, it was announced immediately that if they won the championship in the future, they would give way to the team with the second most points. Therefore, the right to the finals of the overall championship was given to the runner-up Shanghai Star. In Division Two, both Huaqiang and Tongren had ten wins and one loss in eleven games. A rematch was held yesterday, Huaqiang still gave twenty points, but due to the absence of Wang Jinghu, the result was a failure of 86 to 52. The championship of Division Two then belonged to Tongren. Now Shanghai Star and Tongren are scheduled to start the championship finals tomorrow (Saturday). The two-team system will be used for the competition, and the second game is scheduled for next Tuesday (16th). The results of yesterday's game are as follows:

Yougong beat Dalu (Division Two) 42 to 41, (Yougong gave 15 points)

### The Joy of Family

— Mu Chang

"There are no wrong parents in the world." Why do I say this? The nature of parents in the world and their children originally have no wrong places, and everything can come from the most sincere feelings and nature: children for their parents? It is also like this.

Originally, the family should be the most reasonable combination, harmonious and mixed, enjoying the joy of family, "looking to the left at the wife, there are children playing," which is the original face of life. Since the clan society in history, the family system has been perfectly established, and then to the serf society, feudal society, and to the capitalist society, although the family form has changed, its cornerstone - the joy of family - has always existed and developed. I believe that society will continue to develop, and the feelings of parents and children will also be maintained infinitely. Consult social scientists and believe that there is evidence, not as a唯心论.

The problem is how to maintain the feelings of family. Emperor Taizong of Tang once said with emotion: it is easy to govern the world, but difficult to manage a family. The family is originally different from the big society, and parents and children must be frank and not perfunctory, and understand each other in thought and action, which is "understanding." Parents and children are originally figures of two eras, each with its own feelings and opinions, but parents have also been young, and what children need is life experience. Although they are slightly different, it does not hinder the great harmony. Everyone works together in harmony, which is not impossible, and there is no need for opposition, so we can seek "harmony."

In the vertical aspect. There is this consistency; in the horizontal aspect, it should also be reasonable. If there is discord between husband and wife, it is a major pain for the children, and they will eventually develop a kind of hatred in their hearts. Therefore, parents should seek good-intentioned prevention and control.

Speaking only of children being disobedient, we must look at all aspects of children's actions. Children without the joy of family are tantamount to killing half of their lives. Duke Zhuang of Zheng has the sigh of "You have a mother to leave, why am I alone without one", is this not from the bottom of his heart? Naturally, children have a happy future, but they need parental guidance, and there is no reason for a third party to bury them; in case children feel oppressed and ashamed, and are willing to sacrifice the light of youth, that is also not worth it. The so-called unspeakable pain of shame in the midst is definitely not to be borne by the next generation, but rather the parents' remorse.

### Advertisements and Trademarks The First Thing I Think of Is Me

— San San

One evening, Yong and I were walking silently on a not-so-lively road. Suddenly, I asked:

"Yong, which street do you think is the most bustling?" Yong raised his head and looked around, unable to answer for a moment.

So I pointed to the neon sign across the street from a shop and said, "It's more lively over there!" The words on the neon light were reversed.

Therefore, I think the naming of company codes and entertainment venues should be like "Paramount", "Little Luzon", "MGM", "Golden Gate"... so that you can save another neon light installation - how good is a "full house" neon light? On the one hand, it can be seen from a distance, so as not to cause the "missed opportunity" to be boring, and on the other hand, it can show that the theater's full house is "commonplace." I have never published it to others.

A month ago, I drafted my plan outline for a classified advertisement in the newspaper "Seeking (Business) Talents to Cooperate Sincerely" as follows: "(1) Create a unique trademark that can be applied for registration and exclusive use. Its effect can reduce costs by half and will never be affected by rising raw material prices. (2) This business method can be applied for a patent."

However, when I soon saw other recruitment advertisements that had been posted for several days in a row: "Patent New Business Seeks Cooperation", "Invest in New Inventions and Highly Profitable Industry", I don't know why I lost the courage to submit my application.

Then, the Seven Day Newspaper carried: "Lawyer's Statement on Behalf of Tobacco Company Using 'Billboard' Cigarettes." Oh my God! It turned out to be the "Billboard Cigarettes" that I was thinking of. I had planned for it: If each pack of shell surface and cigarette sticks each charge an advertising fee of five cents or a dime, it can reduce most of the cost; and I planned how to obtain patent rights to resist the extremely possible "Advertisement" brands of Adevo in the future...

Who knows that you will also think of it? If you don't say a word. But what's the use of saying it?

For Yourself and Others, You Must "Service-ize Your Career" Heart Source

In the current world, people generally do everything possible to benefit their own careers, unscrupulously engaging in behaviors that harm others and benefit themselves, causing all the misfortunes in the world. Therefore, here at home, I want to loudly advocate: "Service-ize Your Career".

What is service-izing your career? It means that everyone should regard their own private career as a kind of public undertaking. My engagement in this kind of career is no different from serving the public. I must take into account the interests of the public.

I believe that if everyone can hold such a purpose to engage in their own careers, the existing misfortunes in the world can definitely be eliminated a lot. However, on your own side, you will definitely not lose, but you can get supreme benefits. Because if everyone can do this, under the "mutual benefit" of the public, it must be more cost-effective than "private benefit".

Now let's give an example to strengthen your will:

Like "Madame Curie" of France, she is the inventor of the cancer-curing special product "radium". After she worked so hard to discover "radium" in pitchblende ore, she did not apply for a patent. All the discoveries and all the extraction procedures of radium were published completely, and even the "copyright" of the works was not reserved.

She was sympathized with by the American people, and later gave her two huge sums of money twice, but Madame Curie asked them to buy radium. Once it was placed in a public hospital to benefit patients, and once it was used as her own research material. Madame Curie is the inventor of radium, but she doesn't have it herself!

After reading the above example, are you moved? I don't expect everyone to be a second Madame Curie, but I hope to achieve one or two tenths of her.

Anecdotal Tales

### Biographies of People in the Civet Cat Case

— Liu Tang

Two Empress Liu

Emperor Renzong was the main character in this case, and Empress Liu was the most important character in this case. Empress Liu was from Chengdu. Her mother dreamed of the moon and then became pregnant. She was orphaned at a young age and raised in her maternal family. When she grew up, she was good at playing the rattle drum. At the age of fifteen, she met a craftsman from Shu who made silver. He took her to Beijing and entered the residence of Prince Xiang. Prince Xiang was the title of Emperor Zhenzong when he was in his potential residence. Emperor Zhenzong's wet nurse, Wang, was strict and proper, and told Emperor Taizong about her, ordering Emperor Zhenzong to expel her. Emperor Zhenzong had no choice but to hide her in the house of Zhang Qi, the director of the palace.

When Emperor Taizong died, Emperor Zhenzong ascended the throne and made her a beauty. Because she had no clan, he ordered her to change her surname to Liu. Since the death of Empress Guo, Emperor Zhenzong wanted to make her empress, but many ministers thought it was impossible. Therefore, it was not until the fifth year of Dazhong Xiangfu that she was conferred the title. At that time, Emperor Renzong was still in infancy. When Emperor Zhenzong died, Emperor Renzong ascended the throne and listened to the government as Empress Dowager for eleven years, and died at the age of sixty-five.

From the above facts, we know that Emperor Zhenzong loved Empress Liu and never changed his mind. As for why Empress Liu was able to always win Emperor Zhenzong's favor, of course, Liu must have talent, appearance, and personality that could make the emperor's heart inclined; based on the speculation in the history books, it is not difficult to imagine what kind of model person Empress Liu was. (1) Why did one person in Prince Xiang's mansion not be liked by the strict-natured wet nurse of Wang, and even told Emperor Taizong, and Emperor Taizong also wanted to expel her and then stop, which shows that she was "not strict." And Emperor Zhenzong was reluctant to give up and still wanted to place her in Zhang Qi's house in order to reunite, which shows that she was a "sly person who can confuse the master." (2) If she only relied on color and favor, she would not be able to last long, because love fades with age. History calls her "She has a sharp mind, knows history, and can annotate the whole story of the court's affairs. Emperor Zhenzong retired from the court and read the memorials of the world until midnight, and she always heard about them in advance. When there were questions about palace affairs, she often used the old facts to answer. In the fourth year of Tianxi, the emperor was ill for a long time and lived in the palace, and many things were decided by her." With such talent, how could the Emperor Zhenzong not be infatuated and trust her without decline?

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Twelve Unexpected Storms

She originally wanted to say, "But I can't come back for the time being," but she was afraid of saying it too clearly, so she hurriedly changed the subject.

"However, your old man's own body is the most important thing. You have lost a lot of weight these days. I'll send you a few more boxes of lotus root flour tomorrow"! In the simple brain of this little housekeeper of the Meng family, lotus root flour seemed to be a medicine more effective than ginseng, so whenever she encountered someone who was not feeling well, she always advised them to eat lotus root flour.

Autumn Begonia could only thank her a few times for her ignorant kindness and be done with it. In fact, he also suspected that this woman knew something about Mei Bao's disappearance, but he knew that he didn't dare to say it, so he didn't bother to ask.

Perhaps it was because he didn't listen to the Meng family's daughter-in-law and didn't eat lotus root flour that his spirit became more and more tired; although he still struggled to get up every day, people who saw him couldn't help but ask in surprise:

"Why are you sick again?"

In fact, he was already sick! By the time Principal Fang's second letter arrived, almost all he ate every day was a bowl of millet porridge.

The news in the second letter seemed to be better than the first letter. (209)

### The Process of Yu Zhenfei Going Down to the Sea (Part 1) Shao Xian (From Beiping)

Speaking of the affair between Cheng Yanqiu and Yu Zhenfei, I want to use a different writing style, starting from the level of Cheng Yanqiu's supporting actor Xiaosheng. When Cheng Yanqiu formed his own troupe, some of his supporting actors were amateur actors who had gone down to the sea from the Chunyang Friendship Association. Although these characters were amateur actors who had gone down to the sea, they did help Yanqiu become famous. These were Xiaosheng Sheng Youquan, Laosheng Guo Zhongheng, and Laodan Wen Liangchen. At that time, it was the era when Luo Yinggong and Jin Zhongsun were madly supporting Yanqiu. Luo and Jin successively arranged many new plays for Yanqiu. Among these new plays, the three of Wang, Guo, and Wen occupied the most important position, so Yanqiu regarded these three as his right and left hands. I forgot what year it was that they were moved, so they left Yanqiu and supported E Yun. Yanqiu was greatly affected by this change, but fortunately Yanqiu had a way to resolve the danger and still survived the difficulties. Otherwise, Yanqiu's defection by Wang Youquan would have hindered the overall situation, or perhaps there would be no current status. And Wang's ruthlessness is still unforgettable to Yanqiu. After Wang Youquan left Yanqiu, because he had performed with Yanqiu for many years, Wang could perform all of Yanqiu's private plays, and he used this as a gimmick. First he cooperated with Zhang Eyun, and later he played with Xin Yanqiu. Today, the Cheng school plays sung by Eyun Yuhua (Xin Yanqiu) were taught by Youquan back then.

Yuan Xuefen is the leader of the Sijichun Troupe and the leading actress of the Dalai Theatre. She has a clear appearance and dignified demeanor. She is especially suitable for the role of a lady from a wealthy family. Her cooperation with Ma Zhanghua in plays such as "The Sad History of Liang Zhu" and "Three Visits to the Imperial Sister" have unique points and can be called a perfect match. She is meticulous in her work, and whenever she performs to the point of sophistication, she always makes the audience fascinated. Since Zhanghua became a concubine, she left Dalai to form her own troupe, which is deeply regretted by those who hear about it. — Bing Yi Furen

### Wei Ruhe's Fairy Tale Play

— Zou Xiao

Following "Peach Blossom Spring", Wei Ruhe wrote his second fairy tale play, "The Legend of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl." The author uses Freud's psychoanalysis. The bad guys in the real world become demons in the dream, and the good people are rewarded with immortals. In this respect, it is indeed similar to the "Wizard of Oz" movie.

The meaning of this play is very profound. The search for happiness reminds me of Maeterlinck's "The Blue Bird". If "The Legend of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" can be called "Magpie" or "Happiness Bird", it is really a good story of Eastern and Western beauty! However, like "The Blue Bird" and "Peter Pan", they always make good fairy tale dreams, only giving children warmth and intoxication, and will not reveal the ugly reality. Therefore, from beginning to end, it is like a thin mist and light gauze, giving people a smooth feeling, and cannot make people vigilant and alert. However, the fairy tale plays that come with Ruhe are somewhat terrifying, and the meaning is very profound. I think it is suitable for students in senior elementary school and the first and second grades of junior high school to watch. I hope that parents can take their children to appreciate this meaningful fairy tale play; as for junior elementary school students, I think it is not suitable.

The author is a member of the reformed Peking Opera and has long intended to cooperate with Jin Suqin and Zhang Yipeng. This time he has also realized part of his ideals, but it is a drama that has been made into a Peking Opera. For example: in the first act, the Weaver Girl (Shen) sings the domino song, which uses the Chuichang (the tunes of Selling Horses, Beheading Jingtao, and Hundred Flowers Pavilion). In the second act, the demon king spits fire from his mouth, which is like the Kun operas such as Zhong Kui Marrying His Sister or the Fire Judge. The actions of foxes, tigers, wolves, dogs, and rabbits are all guided by Zhang Yipeng, especially the snake spirit action taught by Jin Suqin. In the fourth act, the stone monkey somersaults, and in the fifth act, the goddess (Lan Lan) dances, and the immortals play with silk scarves, singing according to the sound of drums (the tunes of Overlord Bidding Farewell to His Concubine, Cao Cao Cursing the Drum): All of these are often seen and heard in Peking Opera, and now they have all been moved to drama.

"This pair of rural lovers finally became a family with their perseverance." Suddenly, I thought of Eino's "Pioneers" in Finland.

### The Heavenly Palace Will Perform "Under the Pomegranate Skirt"

— Qiu

Since the Heavenly Palace Theater began a long-term performance with China Travel, the play "Grape Wine" has been very popular with audiences and has broken records in box office sales. This play was originally intended to be performed for a maximum of two weeks, and then a new program would be changed. Unexpectedly, it became more and more popular and could not be stopped, so it had to be continued. It has now exceeded three weeks. Although all the actors have been working hard from beginning to end, due to the long performance period, and the play has not adopted the AB system, actors such as Sun Jinglu and Zhao Shu have been performing on stage while sick for several days. It is learned that the troupe decided yesterday that "Grape Wine" will be performed until the 15th and will not be continued. It is estimated that the scheduled plays "Under the Pomegranate Skirt", "Green Blood and Yellow Sand", and "Dong Xiaowan", except for "Dong Xiaowan" which has not yet been rehearsed, the other two plays have been completely rehearsed, so it was decided to replace the five-act comedy "Under the Pomegranate Skirt" from the 16th. It is said that this play is a comedy with a lot of gimmicks. A few years ago, when China Travel was in Beiping, it was performed at Tsinghua University at the invitation of the university. The laughter in the venue almost made it impossible for the performance to proceed on stage. This can also be seen from this.

Chapter Sixteen: Escaping the Cage with Beloved Bird

After exchanging pleasantries, Tian Hongyu said to Wu Sangui, "I have long admired the General's divine and martial prowess. I was fortunate to meet you at the Emperor's banquet the other day, a great honor. This old man has long desired to establish a friendship with the General, but lacked the opportunity. Now that the General is summoned and stationed in the capital, I have specially invited the General to grace my humble abode for a chat, to cultivate a lasting friendship. In my humble home, I usually keep a troupe of female musicians, solely for the purpose of entertaining my twilight years and slightly comforting my old age. Their melodious sounds are still pleasing to the ear. If the General would grant permission, tomorrow night I will prepare wine and delicacies, and arrange a lavish performance of female musicians. What does the General think of playing the role of Zhou Lang, appreciating the music?" Wu Sangui initially declined, saying that he was under the Emperor's orders and had to leave for the frontier immediately to handle military affairs. Military affairs were pressing, and he dared not indulge in leisurely entertainment. However, after Tian Hongyu's repeated and strong invitations, he finally agreed to come once. In fact, Wu Sangui was a lustful warrior. He was merely putting on airs in front of Tian Hongyu, deliberately refusing, not wanting to agree too readily. Moreover, he had heard that the renowned beauty of Jiangnan, Chen Yuanyuan, whom he had not yet met, was the leader of the female musicians in Tian Hongyu's mansion. He had wanted to feast his eyes on her beauty but had been unable to. It was rare for Tian Hongyu to personally come to his door with an invitation. In Wu Sangui's eyes, this was a great opportunity, so how could he pretend to be a moralist to the end and let it slip away? Poor old Tian was senile and ignorant of other people's intentions. Seeing that Wu Sangui had agreed to come, he was overjoyed. After talking for a while longer, he took his leave. He told Yuanyuan about his meeting with Wu, instructing her to lead the female musicians tomorrow night and make some preparations. Yuanyuan secretly rejoiced upon hearing this. The next day, Tian Hongyu instructed his family to prepare the utensils inside and out, making everything exceptionally luxurious. He also ordered all the female musicians to sing and play their instruments to the best of their ability and not to be impolite, so that General Wu would not underestimate the Tian family's female musicians. Everyone naturally obeyed his orders respectfully. As evening approached, Tian Hongyu had already sent his family to watch at the gate, waiting for General Wu to arrive and immediately report it. He himself changed into formal attire and sat in the Siwei Hall, waiting. (166)
