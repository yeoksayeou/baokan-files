### Internal Affairs Conference: Second General Assembly Held Yesterday; Representatives Report on the Implementation of the New County System; Minister Zhou Hosts Banquet for Attending Members at Noon

Chairman Lin's Admonitory Remarks

Chongqing: At the opening of the Internal Affairs Conference, Chairman Lin specially issued the following admonitory remarks: Chairman, Vice-Chairman, and all members, today is the opening of the National Internal Affairs Conference. Those of you attending are either central personnel in charge of internal affairs administration, local personnel in charge of internal affairs administration, or experts with research and experience in internal affairs administration. Your presence reflects a spirit of excitement and enthusiasm, demonstrating your loyalty to your duties and your concern for national policies, which I find exceedingly gratifying. The scope of internal affairs is vast, but it essentially forms the foundation for all other administrative affairs. The establishment of all systems and the implementation of policies, to ensure their universality and effectiveness, ultimately rely on internal affairs facilities. This is true in any era and in any country, and it is especially significant during our unprecedented period of resistance and national reconstruction. The nature of modern warfare and the determination of victory or defeat depend not only on military power, nor only on economic power, but more fundamentally on political organization. The implementation of conscription, economic mobilization, and all other relevant policies rely on rational organization and effective utilization of grassroots administrative institutions at all levels across the country to achieve the desired results and unleash great power. Furthermore, our task is not only to resist aggression but also to build the nation while resisting aggression. Our national construction aims to build a nation based on the Three Principles of the People, and the implementation of the Three Principles of the People is closely related to internal affairs in all aspects. For example, promoting local self-government is a condition for implementing the Principle of Democracy, and implementing land policies is the foundation of the Principle of People's Livelihood. These important facilities fall within the scope of internal affairs, demonstrating the importance of internal affairs for resistance and national reconstruction. This National Internal Affairs Conference is the third since the establishment of the National Government, and the first during the period of resistance and national reconstruction. Since the beginning of the resistance, the Central Government has paid more attention to internal affairs facilities than in normal times. Notable examples include the formulation of the Outline of Organizations at All Levels of Counties, the promulgation of the Regulations on the Organization of Public Opinion Organs at All Levels of Counties, the implementation of land price declarations, and the implementation of eradicating opium and drugs, all aimed at meeting the needs of the War of Resistance and adapting to the demands of the times. Local governments have also been able to implement them to the best of their ability according to the central government's plans, achieving considerable results. However, whether they have been fully implemented and have achieved full benefits requires us to review them, and whether they need to be improved and supplemented requires us to discuss them. I hope that you will bring your administrative experience and research spirit to this conference to review and deliberate carefully, and I hope that the conference will lead to practical implementation, so as to strengthen the power and foundation of resistance and national reconstruction. This is what I expect of you. (Dispatch, 5th)

Zhou Zhongyue's Opening Remarks

Chongqing: Minister Zhou delivered opening remarks at the Internal Affairs Conference on the 5th, briefly stating that it has been ten years since the Second National Internal Affairs Conference in December of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), and internal affairs facilities have made continuous progress. During the Second National Congress of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the Outline of Resistance and National Reconstruction was formulated. The greatest purpose is to save the nation and the Republic of China from danger. Since the beginning of the resistance and national reconstruction, the policy direction of this Ministry has been based on the principles indicated in the Outline of Resistance and National Reconstruction, adjusting local administrative institutions, training local administrative personnel, strengthening local self-defense forces, preparing for local public opinion organs, promoting national spiritual mobilization, and rectifying discipline and clarifying official governance. These are the guiding principles for establishing the foundation of national construction. In order to meet the needs, there have been various new plans and new facilities. However, these various plans and facilities can only be general provisions at the central level, while the responsibility for implementation lies with the provinces, cities, counties, and localities. The circumstances in each locality are different, and the steps and methods of their implementation also vary. Difficult problems often arise, requesting the central government to resolve them, and the central government also urgently wants to understand the implementation status of various parties and gather personnel from various parties to discuss and deliberate carefully, in order to achieve the best results in implementation. The significance of convening this Internal Affairs Conference lies in this. There are many matters that should be discussed at the meeting. What I believe should be emphasized at present are: 1. Strengthening grassroots political organization; 2. Cultivating the people's political ability; 3. Strengthening local self-defense forces; 4. Developing the people's production enterprises; 5. Improving the people's national conference; 6. Reforming bad social habits. These are the basic conditions for mobilizing the masses to resist aggression and the key to revitalizing the nation. However, all these facilities do not lie in empty talk but in practice. I deeply hope that we can motivate the people of the whole country to work together to achieve success. This is the great mission of this conference. (Dispatch, 6th)

### Liu Binglin Publishes Economic Essay

Chongqing: Economist Liu Binglin recently published an article in the Central Daily News, advocating the issuance of US dollar, pound sterling, and Hong Kong dollar savings bonds to restore the people's love for legal tender and the virtue of saving. His proposed method is that the exchange rate between these savings bonds and legal tender should be based on the exchange stabilization fund's rate, allowing them to circulate in the market and be used for bank deposits. However, when remitting abroad, it must be handled in accordance with the rules of the exchange stabilization fund. The cash reserve for these bonds should be 60%, funded by the government's foreign exchange or gold reserves, and the guarantee reserve should be 40%, funded by gold government bonds issued by the government, and kept by the exchange stabilization fund. The bonds should be jointly signed and responsible by Chinese and foreign members of the exchange stabilization fund with prominent credibility. Liu Binglin is currently the Dean of the Faculty of Law at Wuhan University. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### Huang Huilong Passes Away in Hong Kong

Shaoguan: General Huang Huilong, a revolutionary veteran and member of the Military Affairs Commission, had been working in the capital. This spring, he fell ill due to overwork and flew to Hong Kong for treatment. He passed away at his residence in Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 4th due to old age and frailty. He was 59 years old this year. In his youth, he engaged in business overseas and participated in the revolution. He once organized an overseas Chinese team to return to the country to work. He served as an adjutant officer during the Sun Yat-sen's movement. In the 13th year of the Republic of China (1924), he followed Sun Yat-sen on the Northern Expedition. When Sun Yat-sen was seriously ill in Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Huang served day and night, without taking off his clothes. After Sun Yat-sen passed away, he guarded the funeral hall and remained there day and night until the coffin was placed in the Western Hills. After Sun Yat-sen was buried in Zijin Mountain, he served as the Director of the Mausoleum Guarding Office and a Lieutenant General Staff Officer of the National Government. He currently serves as a Lieutenant General Staff Officer of the Military Affairs Commission. He left behind one son, Dingguo, who is studying in a middle school in Hong Kong, and two daughters, who are unmarried. Huang's situation after his death is bleak. Revolutionary comrades in Guangdong are seeking government assistance from the central government on his behalf. (Dispatch, 5th)

### Japanese Response on Troop Deployment in Vietnam: US Deems Unsatisfactory; Pretext of Chinese Threat No Longer Credible; Hull Reveals Principles, Japan Still Studying

Washington, 5th: President Roosevelt and heads of government departments are now carefully studying the response presented by Kurusu yesterday regarding the issue of Japanese troops concentrating in Vietnam. Well-informed observers say that the United States does not consider what Kurusu presented to be the final answer; its content cannot be considered satisfactory nor acceptable to the United States. The Japanese government's response is even broader in scope than its previous response to the contents of the document presented by Hull on the 26th of last month regarding US-Japan relations. When Kurusu and Nomura emerged from Hull's office today, they looked grim and dejected. President Roosevelt also did not comment on the US-Japan issue when meeting with reporters today. The White House today specifically published the full text of the Japanese response as follows: "Recently, Chinese troops have often shown signs of movement along the Sino-Vietnamese border. The Japanese military, based on the primary objective of taking precautionary measures, will make some degree of reinforcement in northern Vietnam. This action by the Japanese government does not exceed the measures of the mutual defense agreement signed by Japan and France."

Reuters, Washington, 6th: Authoritative sources disclosed the reason for Japan's stationing troops in Vietnam, stating that the treaty concluded between Japan and Vichy stipulates the mutual defense of Vietnam. The Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam have not exceeded the limits stipulated by the treaty. The response also stated that the continued stationing of Japanese troops in Vietnam is necessary because the Chinese troops stationed near the border have become a threat to Vietnam and the Japanese troops stationed there. This response was delivered to Hull by Nomura and Kurusu. Kurusu refused to disclose the contents of the response. He told reporters that he hoped US-Japan talks could continue, but said that no concrete measures had been decided yet. Nomura claimed that Tokyo needed several days to study Hull's document, so no instructions had yet arrived in the United States from Tokyo. When asked whether US-Japan talks would continue, Nomura replied, "As far as we are concerned, we have always been willing to talk." Although this response is very important, it may not determine whether the talks will continue. Therefore, Washington officials are now awaiting the Japanese response to the principles revealed by Hull, because any resolution of the Pacific problem must be based on these principles. The key factor determining the fate of the talks is clearly this response. Whether US-Japan relations will further deteriorate will depend on this response.

Reuters, Washington, 6th: Regarding Japan's response on troop deployments in Vietnam, some official circles recognize this as Japan's first subtle indication of yielding. In terms of the response's superficial value, its wording is very different from the hostile rhetoric of Japanese military personnel and newspapers. If Japan cannot yield once and instead begins aggression against Thailand, then Japan would admit its guilt and invite the resistance of the ABCD countries' joint forces. After receiving Hull's memorandum, Japan delayed its response, and now, after more than ten days, it is clear that the Tokyo Cabinet is still painstakingly drafting a reply, as this kind of important diplomatic document is one that the Cabinet has never drafted before. The position here remains unchanged. If peace is sought based on the fundamental principles revealed by Hull, then the door to peace is still not closed. Whether it is closed or open depends on Japan.

United Press, Washington, 6th: Officials said today that Japan's response to President Roosevelt's inquiry about Japanese troops in Vietnam is simply an insult to American intelligence. Japan is clearly not prepared to give up aggression. Officials also said that Vietnam is completely under Japanese occupation. We cannot expect Vichy to testify unfavorably against Japan. The claim that China threatens Vietnam has been heard of for a long time, but is no longer a credible pretext to mask Japan's attempts to seize the interests and land of other countries. At the same time, regarding the Japanese response that Chinese troops are concentrated in southern Yunnan, threatening Vietnam, foreign travelers say they have not seen any troop concentration on the Chinese border, and that the wilderness there is uncultivated and cannot support the long-term stationing of large troops.

Pacific Crisis Unabated, Tragedy Could Unfold at Any Moment

Reuters, London, 6th: The situation in the Pacific is truly grave, and trends indicate a tragedy could unfold at any moment. However, a glimmer of hope remains for maintaining peace. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the shipbuilding week in Bristol, British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander said that he hoped that in the next two or three weeks, those in Japan who clearly want to lead their people into a war of aggression would receive more sensible advice. The clear agreement in principle between the British and American governments, even at this critical moment, should be able to warn Japan that aggression is ultimately futile. News relayed from Washington by the press agency that the Japanese government completely rejected Hull's memorandum was printed in large letters by British newspapers yesterday morning. However, shortly thereafter, a Japanese government spokesman made a statement to the contrary. Reportedly, the Tokyo instructions regarding this matter have not yet been delivered to the Japanese Ambassador to the United States. Furthermore, whether the Japanese government's response to the US President's questioning on the stationing of troops in Vietnam is sufficient and acceptable to allow talks to continue remains to be seen in future developments. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser said that the most serious developments in the Pacific are about to occur in an instant. However, the British Economist interpreted Japanese Prime Minister Tojo's statement that Japan is now at a crossroads, saying that Japanese leaders are now engaged in discussions under the signpost, truly at a loss and uncertain of what path to take.

Reuters, Washington, 6th: Local sources believe that the severity of the crisis in the Far East has not diminished at all. Whether there will be peace or war depends on Tokyo's future actions. Whether the Japanese ambassador's explanation to the US President regarding the stationing of troops in Vietnam can be accepted remains questionable. It is said that the President is currently studying this formal response.

United Press, Tokyo, 6th: Cabinet Information Bureau Deputy Spokesman Humin refused to comment yesterday on whether the Washington talks would fail or succeed. He said, "I do not believe that the United States is currently deliberately delaying negotiations to buy time. I still believe that both sides are sincerely attempting to find some way to realize a peaceful situation in the Pacific."

### Australian War Cabinet Convenes Emergency Meeting; Leave of Troops in Darwin Canceled; Close Liaison with Dutch East Indies

Reuters, Melbourne, 6th: After adjourning at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, the Australian War Cabinet and its ministers were preparing to return to their home states by train, but after receiving news of continued changes in the Far East situation, they stopped their departure. Kordin then reconvened an emergency cabinet meeting. Australian Air Force Chief of Staff General Barnett was also summoned to the meeting. The meeting lasted twenty minutes. Then, Minister for Air Drakeford announced that the leave of all personnel of the Australian Air Force in Darwin Port had been canceled. The reason given was the large-scale southward movement of Japanese troops in the Far East. At the same time, the leave of ground forces was also canceled indefinitely, and soldiers in the southern states are now returning to their units. Ford said that in view of the current stage of events in the Pacific, the government felt that canceling leave was unavoidable. However, he hoped that this change was temporary. Those who were granted Christmas leave at other military sites would need to wait for the international situation to clear up before their requests were approved. The War Cabinet reconvened in Melbourne today, and the War Council has also been convened. Other matters discussed by the cabinet include: 1. Building essential roads suitable for all weather conditions; 2. Ordering one million gas masks for the public to use during gas attacks; 3. Adding female doctors to the Australian Air Force; 4. Providing a sufficient number of officers to the volunteer defense force composed of men aged 18 to 60.

Reuters, Melbourne, 6th: Responsible authorities issued a frank warning to Japan, stating that although the current situation may develop at any time, Japan seems to still be at a stage of secretly observing how far it can advance without going to war with Britain and the United States. Therefore, the most important thing is to solemnly announce our unity and to show no fear of their threats.

Reuters, Melbourne, 6th: A political reporter for the Melbourne Herald said that Australia is now on the verge of fighting Japan. In response to Japanese aggression, the Australian government, in consultation with the ABCD countries, is taking concerted actions to counter Japan's actions.

Havas, Melbourne, 5th: Officials announced that the Australian Commonwealth and the Dutch East Indies authorities have maintained close contact. In addition, Australian Commonwealth Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Royle recently attended a military conference in Singapore to discuss the coordination of British land, sea, and air force operations.

Reuters, Batavia, 6th: The new Dutch Colonial Minister Kostens is scheduled to fly to Australia and the United States on the 8th with his family on a special plane. After arriving in San Francisco, he will visit Dutch Guiana and arrive in Washington after Christmas. The new Minister of Economic Affairs Mok will probably go to Washington first and then inspect the Dutch West Indies.

### Imperial Audience: Tojo and Sugiyama Anxious on the Situation; Newspaper Expresses Pessimism

United Press, Tokyo, 6th - The Japanese Cabinet held a routine meeting yesterday for about two hours, apparently to discuss the Washington negotiations and President Roosevelt's inquiry regarding Japan's objectives in the Far East. After attending the military academy graduation ceremony, the Emperor went to the Imperial Army Headquarters to meet with Prime Minister and Army Minister General Tojo and Chief of the General Staff General Sugiyama. He also dined with senior military personnel.

United Press, Tokyo, 6th - Japanese newspapers are taking an increasingly pessimistic view of the Far Eastern situation, indicating that the worst is approaching. The Yomiuri Shimbun claims that Japan's attitude towards the United States is firm and unwavering, and that Japan is prepared for any development and will not be swayed by empty threats. The Kokumin Shimbun states that the outcome of the Washington negotiations has reached the final stage, and that if American troops attack East Asia, the 1.1 billion people of Southeast Asia will become a bomb.

### Thailand Ready to Defend Against Unexpected Attacks: Prime Minister Denies Military Alliance with Foreign Powers

Reuters, Bangkok, 6th - Thai Prime Minister Sangkhlan told reporters yesterday that Thailand has not entered into any secret military alliance with any foreign country. He stated that Thailand has a non-aggression pact with Britain and a friendship treaty with Japan. If Britain and Japan do not regard these solemn agreements as scraps of paper, Thailand has no reason to fear aggression. Thailand does not know who the enemy will be, but must be prepared at all times to avoid unexpected attacks. If we cannot escape war, we can only fight to the end.

At a time when the Far Eastern situation is approaching a breaking point, the Thai Prime Minister deems it necessary to make this statement publicly. Therefore, diplomatic observers attach great importance to it, believing that the Thai Prime Minister's two firm denials in three weeks of Thailand's military alliance with other countries are significant. It is understood that on November 11th, the Thai Prime Minister refuted a newspaper report that Thailand was negotiating a joint defense agreement with Britain. Now, the Thai Prime Minister has issued this statement again, fearing to give others an excuse to regard treaties as scraps of paper.

Reuters, Tokyo, 6th - This morning, Japanese newspapers continue to claim that Britain is preparing to invade Thailand, saying that Britain will disregard the U.S.-Japan talks and advance into Thailand. The Asahi Shimbun claims that Thailand will not take action until after the U.S. and Japan go to war, so it is widely believed that Britain and the U.S. are now preparing to deal with the Thailand issue quickly.

### British Commentator Says Japan Building Massive Battleships, Five Vessels of 40,000 Tons

United Press, London, 6th - An official commentator for the British Broadcasting Corporation stated last night that Japan is currently building at least five 40,000-ton battleships, and that two of these vessels may have already entered service. He also stated that these battleships are comparable to the U.S. Navy's "North Carolina" class, armed with nine 16-inch guns and capable of a speed of 20 knots.

United Press, Tokyo, 6th - Japanese newspapers are making comparisons, an act that suggests speculation that the Washington negotiations are on the verge of collapse. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun claims that the United States aims to wield hegemony in East Asia, while Japan's aim is to hope for peace, resulting in a complete violation of America's basic principles. The Jiji Shimpo evening edition published a photo of Japanese warships flexing their muscles in the Pacific Ocean, captioned "Naval Defenses Are Ready," and proclaimed that the United States, busy building a two-ocean navy, underestimates Japan's maritime defense capabilities. Other newspapers also prominently featured an essay by Nichi Nichi Shimbun critic Maruyama in a magazine, who stated that "the expansion of the U.S. Navy makes the possibility of war in the Pacific more likely." The essay also stated that the formation of the ABCD line invalidated the geographical barriers that originally prevented disputes between the U.S. and Japan. America takes an aggressive attitude towards Japan, and although events have proven that the U.S. cannot wage war due to assisting Britain, and its two-ocean navy will not be completed for another six years, the U.S. still overestimates its naval strength.

### Chicago Sun Launched: Chiang Kai-shek Sends Congratulatory Message; Democratic Nations Will Surely Defeat Aggression; Chinese Feel Victory is Assured

United Press, Chicago, 6th - The "Chicago Sun," competing with the anti-government "Chicago Tribune," began publication yesterday and announced its support for President Roosevelt's foreign policy. The newspaper published congratulatory messages from President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, Chiang Kai-shek, and other world figures. "We are now entering the fifth year of our long struggle for freedom. When this war broke out, we fought alone, without any outside assistance. 450 million Chinese now feel that final victory is assured. At this stage of the fifth year, we who started alone now hear that we have become a world force advancing democratic institutions. On land, this world front stretches across Eurasia to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. At sea, it crosses the Pacific to the democratic nations of South and North America. We believe that this world front is firmly based on the will of democratic nations. This is the will of all peoples who support democratic governments, and it is the basis of the policies of democratic governments. The Chinese people have always believed in the sympathy of the American people, and today, America's genuine efforts, such as President Roosevelt's lend-lease policy, are realizing America's sympathy for China. Among the newspapers of democratic countries, the greatest task is to give people the freedom to express their opinions. Your newspaper's founding is based on this principle and serves democracy. We warmly welcome your newspaper, for it represents a new guarantee of American principles."

### Britain Now at War with Finland, Hungary, and Romania; Canada to Follow Suit; Finnish Envoy Leaves Britain

Reuters, London, 6th - It is officially announced that Britain has sent notes to Finland, Hungary, and Romania, as a result of which a state of war will exist between these three countries and Britain. The notes sent by Britain to the governments of these three countries last week have not received satisfactory responses.

Reuters, London, 6th - According to official announcements, the Finnish envoy to Britain, Mr. Gripenberg, who has been stationed here for nine years, is preparing to depart for his home country today with his staff. The British envoy to Finland, Mr. Vereker, currently stationed in Lisbon, and his staff will also depart for Britain at the same time.

Haitong News Agency, Budapest, 6th - Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bardossy delivered the following message to the House of Representatives yesterday in an extremely tense atmosphere: "The U.S. Legation in Hungary, acting on behalf of British interests, delivered an ultimatum to the Hungarian government three days ago. The ultimatum expires at midnight on December 5th, so from midnight onwards, Hungary and Britain will be in a state of war. Hungary accepts the British ultimatum without needing to provide a response." Bardossy then solemnly pointed out that Britain should understand Hungary's vital interest in defending the country and resisting Bolshevism.

Haitong News Agency, Bucharest, 6th - After the British government presented the Romanian government with the aide-memoire on December 1st, Romania yesterday handed its reply to the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Romania for transmission to Britain. The Romanian government refused to accept Britain's demands to cease military operations against the Soviet Union and withdraw troops to the Dniester River. According to Romanian officials, Romania's reply will not be published, nor is it planned to issue any statement.

United Press, London, 6th - Britain's declaration of war on Finland, Hungary, and Romania will have the following four consequences for those three countries: First, these three countries and their territories will be subject to attack by British naval, land, and air forces at any time. Second, these three countries will be regarded as enemy countries at any future peace conference. Third, Britain will impose a full-scale blockade on these three countries. Fourth, the thousands of citizens of these three countries residing in Britain, especially those of military age, will be regarded as enemy aliens and may be imprisoned.

Reuters, Ottawa, 6th - According to responsible sources, Canada will follow Britain's lead and declare war on Finland, Hungary, and Romania. It is now believed that these three countries are vassals of Germany. This declaration of war will not result in the detention of residents of these countries in Canada, except for dangerous elements.

Havas News Agency, Washington, 6th - Britain's declaration of war on Finland, Hungary, and Romania will not immediately worsen the United States' relations with those three countries, as trade with those countries has been suspended for eight months and funds in the U.S. have been frozen. Only a thin thread of diplomatic relations remains.

Editorial

### Japan's Dilemma

U.S. Secretary of State Hull first presented a note to Japan on November 26, stating the U.S.'s basic position and requesting a concrete response from Tokyo. Deputy Secretary of State Welles then, on December 2, acting on President Roosevelt's orders, questioned Kurusu about Japan's troop increase in Vietnam, also requesting a prompt response from Tokyo. Regarding the former, the Japanese envoy excused that the Cabinet was carefully studying it, and although ten days have passed, a formal reply has not yet been submitted. Regarding the latter, Nomura has already replied to Hull, stating two points: (1) The number of troops stationed in Vietnam is in accordance with the Franco-Japanese agreement; (2) The purpose of stationing troops in Vietnam is to prevent a threat from Chinese forces and is not intended to endanger Thailand. The content of this reply was officially released by the White House, so it is presumably accurate. If so, it is not only sophistry but simply a lie. First, the number of troops stipulated in the Franco-Japanese agreement was reportedly 6,000 for the first time and increased to 25,000 for the second time. According to recent reports, the number of Japanese troops has gradually increased to 130,000 to 140,000. Moreover, in addition to the land and air forces, the Japanese have concentrated more than 100 warships in various ports in southern Vietnam and Hainan Island, which is clearly beyond the scope of the agreement. Second, the Japanese claim that China's troop movements on the Yunnan border threaten Vietnam, which is putting the cart before the horse. If Japan had not sent troops to occupy Vietnam, had not actively built airfields in Hanoi, Haiphong, and other places, and had not concentrated a large number of warships on the sea surface of the Indochinese Peninsula, fully preparing to attack Yunnan and disrupt the Burma Road, why would China need to be busy with precautions? Why would the United States need to ask this question? To claim that such a far-fetched, fact-twisting, and even evasive and unresponsive reply would satisfy the Washington authorities is to treat President Roosevelt as an ignorant fool.

In fact, what is noteworthy is not the "fact-twisting" content of this reply, but the Tokyo government's avoidance of the main point by failing to respond to Hull's more important note. Everyone knows that the content of the note is to reiterate the United States' consistent anti-aggression stance, thereby requesting Japan to express its attitude on several basic principles proposed by the United States, such as withdrawing from the Axis, abandoning aggression, withdrawing troops stationed in China and Vietnam, and respecting the principle of equal commercial opportunities. According to the so-called Tojo Three Principles, and the statements published by the Japanese government, public, and newspapers, it seems that there is no need for "research" to know that there is no room for accepting such requests from the United States. Therefore, Japan can simply and quickly submit a reply, giving a "straightforward rejection." However, unexpectedly, the Japanese Cabinet did not do so, but instead discussed and debated again and again, delaying and delaying, and was slow to send out a reply, causing the likes of Kurusu and Nomura to put on a brave face and make various excuses whenever they met reporters. What was particularly embarrassing was that Hull did not wait for Japan to reply and had already issued a statement, on the one hand, condemning Japan for using force to oppress Asian nations, and on the other hand, revealing the fundamental lack of progress in the views of both sides since the U.S.-Japan talks began. The intention of this was to urge Tokyo to state its position as soon as possible and to warn it not to continue to be ambiguous and evasive. In other words, what the United States is asking Japan to answer today is only the words "yes" or "no," and it does not want to use the old trick of delaying and evading to deceive the United States again.

So why is it that the Japanese militarist government, which is so arrogant and determined to "sweep away Britain and the United States," has not yet given a straightforward reply? It is not difficult to see that Japan is still suffering from "daring not to fight, but unable to make peace." Under such an awkward situation, it has no choice but to return to the policy of "waiting." It hoped to wait for some changes to occur on the Moscow front, but unfortunately, the facts were just the opposite. It also hoped that the Nazis would launch a new offensive against Britain, but that was also far off. In short, the main goal of Japanese diplomacy at this stage is still to delay and stall, in order to wait for an opportunity on the one hand, and to step up preparations on the other. However, although Japan sees delaying and stalling as beneficial, time is Japan's greatest enemy, because first, today's Japan is already surrounded on all sides, not only isolated and without help, but also without access to supplies; second, Japan can step up preparations, but the preparations of the democratic front are advancing even faster. The greater the collective strength of the latter, the more strength it accumulates with each passing day. The steady arrival of the British Far East Fleet is one example. Third, the domestic situation in Japan is already as "complex and bizarre" as it can be. The moderates may be willing to wait and see again, but the radicals may not be able to wait any longer. At the same time, the Japanese economy, which is groaning under the blockade and freeze, may not allow its authorities to make a quick decision. As the London Economic Weekly said, the Japanese Cabinet "is now consulting under the signpost," not only wandering in different directions, unable to distinguish between fortune and misfortune, but also under the urging of the United States and the temptation of Germany, it does not know how to continue its opportunistic tricks. Is this why it has been slow to respond to Hull's note?

### U.S. House Passes New National Defense Supplemental Budget Totaling $18 Billion, Army, Navy, and Air Force to Be Greatly Expanded

Reuters, Washington, 6th - The U.S. defense expenditure for November totaled $1,437,000,000, including the cost of purchasing important reserves. United Press, Washington, 6th - The House of Representatives yesterday passed a huge new national defense supplemental appropriation bill totaling $8,243,000,000, including $1,556,000,000 for new lend-lease expenses for the immediate expansion of the U.S. Army to two million men. The House also passed the allocation of general funds to maintain the recently mobilized Philippine Army without any modification. The allocation is as follows: Army expenses, $9,127,000,000; Navy, $1,129,000,000; national defense barracks expenses, $10,000,000; national defense highways and emergency aircraft skid expenses, $129,000,000; Alaskan highway construction costs, $500,000; third lock line of the Panama Canal costs, $104,000,000; relief and Red Cross expenses, $35,000,000. The current allocation is urgently needed for: * Increasing the army to create a peacetime record of 2 million men, but the total number of divisions including all previous is 8. * Maintaining 160,000 troops in the recently mobilized Philippine Army. * Acquiring special ordnance. * Increasing the Army Air Corps from 54 groups to 84 groups, which requires sufficient funds to purchase 16,000 aircraft. * Building 400 mine-laying boats and patrol boats. * Improving the armament of warships and merchant ships. * Increasing the production of important military equipment. * Converting large merchant ships into aircraft carriers and arming 1,000 merchant ships by June 30, 1943.

### Polish Prime Minister Speaks in Soviet Union, Believes Democratic Nations Will Prevail

TASS, Moscow, 6th - Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, General Sikorski, delivered a speech on Moscow Radio. The main points are as follows: * Hitler originally intended to occupy Moscow before April, but at this moment I am still broadcasting a speech in Moscow, which proves the effectiveness of Stalin's leadership in guiding national defense. * The current war is not a territorial dispute, but a worldwide revolution and a life-and-death struggle between democracy and authoritarianism. I firmly believe that democratic nations will achieve ultimate victory. * Poland was defeated due to its backward armament, but it will never surrender. * Britain is a heroic nation that deeply understands the threat Germany poses to all mankind. The heroic resistance of the British forces in 1940 has stalled Hitler's plans. Germany may then shift part of its military strength to attack Britain, but it will surely fail. * The vast territory of the Soviet Union has caused Germany's "lightning" war to fail. Germany's territorial gains will never determine the outcome of the war. German propaganda claimed that the Red Army had been defeated. After my visit to the Soviet Union, I have completely confirmed the inaccuracy of these lies. * The unity of democratic nations will promote the great counter-offensive on the Eastern and Western fronts. The Polish army will participate in this counter-offensive. * In the past year, Hitler has been successful in combat and countries have been ravaged, but at this moment, he is further away from victory than he was a year ago. * A year ago, Hitler's "new order" plan seemed to have been successful, but now the people of various European countries have risen up. Hitler has united all European countries. 180 million people in Europe pose a major threat to Germany's rear. * Germany's vassals will cause their respective countries to meet a tragic end. * The war will be prolonged, and we must continue to work hard, but democratic nations are receiving assistance from the United States. The greatest victory in human history is about to come.

### United States Begins Training 10,000 Bomber Pilots; Isolationist Newspaper Reveals Military Plans; Stimson Condemns Lack of Patriotism

Havas News Agency, Washington, 5th - Secretary of War Stimson stated that the government is currently working on training 10,000 bomber pilots and is scheduled to complete the training by next year, so that they can be assigned to long-range bombers. The number of these aircraft being manufactured is increasing daily. These 10,000 trained youths will be selected from senior high school students and will be required to learn a mixed curriculum of bombing and piloting techniques after being tested. Their study period will be longer than that of the bomber crew currently being trained. At present, an average of 30,000 bomber crew members are trained each year. In addition, the Department of the Army also plans to form 52 battalions of "tank destroyer squadrons" and convert two divisions of the regular army into motorized units.

Reuters, Washington, 6th - Secretary of War Stimson yesterday condemned a report in the Chicago Tribune (an isolationist newspaper) claiming that the army had a secret plan to send an expeditionary force to Europe as "lacking loyalty and patriotism." It is claimed that the information published by the newspaper was an incomplete work that the General Staff was responsible for researching in an emergency for the United States' national defense production needs, and was a procedure that had not been approved by the government. It must be welcomed by the United States' potential enemies and may harm national defense.

### To Replenish Reserves: Rice and Coal Purchase Limits Reduced; Rice Limited to Half a Peck from Today; Coal Briquettes Limited to Half a Load at $20 per Load

Planned Household Survey for Even Distribution if Necessary

Recently, due to the unstable situation, the supply of daily necessities such as rice and coal is being addressed. Although reserves are extremely full, precautionary measures must be taken. After consideration by the authorities, a household survey is planned as the first key step to ensure a basis for distribution at any time. In the meantime, rice and coal purchase limits are being temporarily reduced to conserve supplies and enrich reserves. It is reported that rice prices in the suburbs of Shanghai are very low, probably due to oversupply. Along the coast, prices have fallen to $130 per stone for domestic rice. The price of rice carried into Shanghai by individual peddlers is not much cheaper due to high transportation costs. Most of the rice in warehouses has not yet been released to the market. The Bureau's rice is being transported to Shanghai by ships on a rotating basis, so there is no need to worry about shortages. What the citizens hope for now is that the price limits should be gradually lowered, not raised higher and higher. The Public Works Department (工部局) is well aware of the situation and stated yesterday that the maximum price limit for coal briquettes, $20 per load, should be reduced soon. This remains to be seen. The purpose of the Stabilization Fund (平準會) providing foreign exchange for Shanghai's necessities is to maintain the lives of the people of Shanghai, which is also widely understood.

Household Survey to Commence Soon

According to a statement from the Public Works Department's Information Office, the Department is currently taking various necessary steps not only to maintain reserves of essential items but also to ensure the fair distribution of these items. The Department has obtained full cooperation from all relevant parties and hopes for the full cooperation of the citizens. Although shipping is currently difficult, there is no reason to panic if individuals cooperate with the authorities. To ensure the fair distribution of essential items, the Department plans to begin a household survey in the International Settlement soon, as the basis for a plan to fairly distribute essential items to all legitimate residents. The purpose of this plan is not to reduce consumption but to ensure equal distribution. This measure is being taken to safeguard the lives of Shanghai residents. As for important foods such as fish, meat, eggs, and vegetables, there is ample supply from the surrounding areas, so there is no need to transport them from abroad. The Department is currently taking various steps to obtain ships to transport essential items such as rice, coal, and flour from abroad to Shanghai. The current stocks of these items in the port are being properly protected because the Department has prohibited their export. Their management and distribution are being strictly monitored by the municipal authorities. The sugar reserves are sufficient to meet the needs of the port for the time being. As for other important locally manufactured items, their stocks and the raw materials needed are also sufficient and can last for quite some time. The Department does not plan to manage individual purchases in this regard.

Rice Purchases Limited to Eight Catties Each Time

The Public Works Department recently issued Announcement No. 5629, stating that from the 7th of this month, each rice store will not be allowed to sell more than half a peck (eight catties) of rice at a time. On the same day, Announcement No. 5630 was issued, stipulating that from the 7th of this month, anyone who has not obtained a rice transport permit from the Public Works Department's Rice and Grain Office will not be allowed to transport various types of rice exceeding half a peck within the International Settlement or to the French Concession. The Information Office of the Department issued the following supplementary announcement:

"In order to further prevent the hoarding of rice, the Department has no choice but to announce that the amount of rice sold separately within the International Settlement will be reduced to half a peck from the 7th of this month. Since the beginning of last month, the Department has taken various measures, but the practice of citizens hoarding rice has not been eliminated, resulting in purchases often exceeding daily needs. Currently, the port's rice reserves are ample and can meet all normal needs for a considerable period. The various measures successively promulgated by the Department are designed for the public interest and aim to ensure the fair distribution of rice to the citizens under proper control."

Rice and Coal Supplies Not Expected to Be Interrupted

The sources of rice and coal briquettes will not be interrupted. Although British ships have suspended voyages, existing ships are maintaining shipping routes. The situation has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the Jardine Matheson-managed ship "Nott," carrying rice from Rangoon, is expected to arrive in Shanghai around next Tuesday. The "Kai Lee" ship, carrying 4,127 tons of coal briquettes from Java, is expected to arrive in Shanghai next week and will be docked at buoys 31 and 32.

New Coal Briquette Price May Be Reduced

The Public Works Department recently issued an announcement, stating that from the 8th of this month, the maximum retail price of coal briquettes in the International Settlement should be $20 (National Currency) per load (100 catties).

On the same day, an announcement was also issued, stating that from today until further notice, the retail sale of coal briquettes will not exceed half a load (50 catties) at a time. Regarding the price of coal briquettes, the Information Office of the Public Works Department issued the following announcement: "Due to the use of foreign exchange allocated by the Equalization Fund Committee, the maximum retail price of coal briquettes set by the Department's announcement on the 6th of this month, $20 per load, will be reduced soon."

Industrial Coal Users Should Report Needs

The Public Works Department recently issued an announcement, stating that all industrial coal users who have not reported their minimum monthly coal needs and current coal stocks to the Department should do so as soon as possible without further delay. The reported numbers will be investigated by the Department. If any false reporting is found, appropriate penalties will be imposed when the Department allocates coal. Blank reporting forms can be obtained from the Coal Control Committee, Office No. 330 of the Department, and must be completed and submitted to the Committee for verification by the 15th of this month. Those who delay reporting will be considered by the Department as not requiring the Department's assistance in future coal supply.

Coal Merchants Should Report Sales

The Public Works Department recently issued an announcement, stating that all merchants who sell and retail coal briquettes in the International Settlement should complete reporting forms and submit them to the Department by the 15th of this month, detailing their coal purchases and sales. Blank reporting forms can be obtained from the Coal Control Committee, Office No. 330, at the Department's main office at No. 3 Hankow Road.

### Biography of Wiedemann, Hitler's Close Friend

Wiedemann, the former German Consul General in San Francisco who was recently transferred to Tianjin, has arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing and is currently staying at the International Hotel. He will be staying in Shanghai for about a week. The purpose of his visit is unknown, but it is reported that he will play an important role in the Axis powers' meeting in Shanghai early next week. According to reports from Washington, the meeting will also discuss matters related to the Japanese-American negotiations. Therefore, the general public is very interested in his visit. He is a close friend of Hitler and has repeatedly undertaken special missions abroad, earning Hitler's trust. During the last World War, Wiedemann was the commander of the 16th Bavarian Division, and Hitler was only a regiment commander under him. His first trip abroad was in November 1937, when he visited the United States. He then went to London for a surprising visit and met several times with Chamberlain and Halifax. In February 1939, he became the German Consul General in San Francisco. American journalists regarded him as a secret guest. It is also reported that the former German Minister to Bolivia, Winter, also arrived in Shanghai on Thursday this week to participate in the upcoming Axis meeting. The First Secretary of the Italian Embassy in Shanghai, Ferrazoli, has also returned to Shanghai from Nanjing.

### Acceptance of Parcels to the United States Suspended

The Postal Administration announced yesterday that due to transportation difficulties, the bureau will suspend the acceptance of all parcels sent to the United States and Canada from today. This is hereby announced. It is also learned that the bureau has negotiated with the Manila Post Office on transshipment methods. About 2,000 parcels that have not yet been sealed and sent to the United States and the United Kingdom will be returned to the senders, and they will be notified to send them again when the shipping routes resume.

### Public Works Department Enjoys Priority Rental Rights for Cargo Ship Space; Electricity Company Ships Have Agreed to be Rented

No Need to Worry About the Supply of Necessities

Since the British Naval Authorities issued a slight adjustment order to British merchant ships operating on the Chinese coastal routes, traffic between Shanghai and Hong Kong has been blocked, which has an impact on the import of food and fuel. The Public Works Department convened a Transportation Committee to review the current situation and discuss countermeasures. It is reported that it has been decided to rent a ship owned by the Shanghai Electric Power Company for the use of the Public Works Department, and to make full use of neutral ships coming to Shanghai from various places, such as the French Shipping Company, Java Company, and Panama ships, to clear cargo transportation. The Public Works Department and merchants have a large number of necessities in stock, enough for Shanghai's use for one year. People can rest assured about the supply of goods. The Public Works Department has already ordered a large amount of rice and flour, which can be shipped as soon as a ship arrives in Shanghai. Moreover, the Public Works Department enjoys priority rights for cargo ship space, because on the one hand, it has been approved by the Stabilization Fund to supply legal foreign exchange, and on the other hand, it is also beneficial to the public. It is also learned that the Public Works Department has now started planning to set bread prices, and it is expected that bread prices will fall soon. It is said that the Public Works Department will sign contracts with various bread factories to suppress the price of bread.

### Jurisdiction Area Has Been Demarcated; "E" Police District to Be Established

About 500 Police Officers; Chinese Constables in the North District Allowed to Carry Guns Simultaneously

The soon-to-be-established "E" police district will be managed by Japanese national Koya Hisao, who joined the Public Works Department in September as Deputy Chief Inspector of the Police Department. The "E" District police force will be composed of about 300 officers, with Japanese officers outnumbering those of other countries. As for its

Jurisdiction Area

It will be the area formerly under the jurisdiction of the Jiazhou Road and Diswei Road police stations, which is patrolled by the "C" District police force. The establishment period will not exceed about ten days, but there are currently several minor issues that have not been agreed upon by both parties. According to observations from various sources, the establishment of the "E" police district will expand the influence of the Japanese in the Police Department, but at the same time, the Public Works Department will be able to manage the area north of the Suzhou River, and the influence of the Japanese army in that area will be weakened. According to reliable information obtained by a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, the area north of Wuchang Road, east of North Sichuan Road, which was originally part of the jurisdiction of the Hongkou Police Station, the jurisdiction area of the Jiazhou Road Police Station, and the Diswei Road, Shigota Road, North Sichuan Road, and Hongkou Park under the jurisdiction of the Diswei Road Police Station will all be assigned to the "E" police district. However, due to the

Japanese Police Powers

Problem, both parties are still discussing, so the establishment is pending. The police officers in the district will generally consist of 270 original personnel from the three police stations (30 detectives and 60 constables each), plus 300 new police officers, for a total of about 500 people. The first director of the "E" District Office has been decided to be Alternate Deputy Chief Inspector Koya Hisao, while the head of the section is internally designated to be Yamaguchi, the current head of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Special Police Department. The branch chiefs are TsukasakI Masatoshi, the current Inspector of the Hongkou Police Station, and Shimizu Yonosuke, the current Alternate Patrol Officer of the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station. At the same time, the Japanese side agreed that after the establishment of the "E" police district, all Chinese police officers from the Jiazhou Road, Diswei Road, Hongkou, West Hongkou, Huishan, Yulin Road, and Yangshupu police stations can carry handguns when on duty. The Japanese team of the Police Department has about 220 people. Now, due to the establishment of the "E" police district, there is a saying that 80 vacancies need to be filled.

### Public Buses Use Teisul Oil

An employee of the British-owned Public Bus Company told a reporter from the Datong News Agency that the public buses have been converted to use Teisul oil, so the shortage of gasoline has not affected the operation of the public buses. He also said that Shanghai has ample reserves of Teisul oil, so there is no need to worry about shortages in the near future, and the company has also saved oil to continue to maintain its business and avoid shutdowns. At the same time, yesterday, the three major oil companies, Asia, American Mobil, and Texaco, issued another notice, stating that from today, car users holding oil allocation certificates for December will be limited to purchasing three gallons per car per day. The notice also urged the public not to drive cars casually unless it is necessary.

### No Transportation of Flammable Materials on Roads in the French Concession

The French Consul General issued a public notice yesterday, stating that from now on, the transportation of all flammable liquids, solids, or chemicals is prohibited within the French Concession. However, those holding special passes from the French Concession Fire Department are still allowed to pass. If flammable materials are transported privately without a pass, they will be confiscated immediately upon discovery. It is believed that this measure is to reduce the danger of fire.

### Cake and Steamed Bun Association to Distribute Leveling Flour Starting Yesterday

After receiving a notice from the Public Works Department's Flour Management Committee, instructing them to handle the purchase of flour and payment matters as soon as possible, the Cake and Steamed Bun Industry Association of this city immediately began to proceed. The procedures were completed yesterday. For this Public Works Department's distribution of leveling flour, the cake and steamed bun industry was allocated 1,500 bags, but the amount of flour required by each member every day is calculated to be 386 bags, that is, those who registered for one bag of leveling flour will be given three times the amount, and the remaining insufficient amount will be deducted from the distribution of most flour-receiving households. It was also agreed that the Xiehexiang Rice Store at 133 Ningxing Street, French Concession, would be the flour collection point for the members. The cake and steamed bun shops that collect flour can go directly to the association with their membership cards to collect flour from today.

### Grand Wedding Ceremony of the Gu Family

Yesterday, Gu Zhuxuan, a celebrity in Shanghai, married his son, Nai Geng, to Guiying, the second daughter of Xie Baosheng. Both the Gu and Xie families are well-known in Shanghai, so many dignitaries and celebrities gathered at the wedding, such as Huang Jinrong, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Guan Wangzhi, Qu Yingguang, Jiang Fang, Huang Zhensheng, Zhang Chunshi, Zhou Fuchen, Zheng Jiansan, Zhou Jiaxiang, as well as celebrities from the opera and ticket circles, such as Xi Xiaobo, Li Guichun and his son, Zhao Ruquan, Liu Hanchen, Lin Shusen, Huang Guiqiu, Sun Lanting, Jin Yuansheng, Zhao Peixin, Zhang Boming, and Fu Rushan, numbering no less than several thousand people. The wedding ceremony was held at 3:00 PM with music played by the Public Works Department band. Gu Zhuxuan said that the times are extraordinary and he did not want to be extravagant, so the stage show was only performed by all the actors of the Tianchan Stage. The famous actors from the north who intended to participate were politely thanked by Gu. Even so, the grand occasion of the Ningbo Township Association was also rare after the incident.

### Jiuhe Silver Shop Opens

Jiuhe Silver Shop at 384 Beijing Road will officially open on the 8th. The shop specializes in buying and selling yarn, cloth, bullion, stocks, etc. on behalf of customers. It also has a banking department to handle all banking business, adding a unique highlight to the silver shop industry.

### Expressing Sympathy to Doctor Diao Xinde

Editor, reading your newspaper, I was shocked to learn that Doctor Diao Xinde's grandson was kidnapped. I have no connection with Doctor Diao, but I am writing this letter not to please him, nor to plead with the kidnappers on behalf of the doctor. The purpose of kidnapping is money. Once the hostage falls into their hands, some money will always be demanded, and there is no chance of being spared. The intention of my letter is to express sympathy to Doctor Diao, because Doctor Diao is a rare talent in the medical community, and his medical ethics are worthy of emulation by the medical community. He has practiced medicine for decades without any of the bad habits of famous doctors today. He arrives as soon as a patient calls, and never takes the opportunity to extort money. He not only provides free medical treatment to poor and sick families, but also sometimes donates medicine and money. He is kind and compassionate, as everyone in society knows. All his savings before the war were lost when the Meifeng Bank went bankrupt. Now his grandson has been kidnapped. Why is Heaven rewarding good people like this? Living in a troubled world, full of thorns, how can one not sigh? It is hoped that those who are responsible for protecting public security will pay great attention to this. Sincerely, a Cantonese.

### Zhang Qingfa, Manager of Xingye Vacuum Flask Factory, Shot Dead

An Old Woman Also Killed Simultaneously; The Murderer Was Arrested; The Assistant Manager of the Factory Was Also Assassinated Two Months Ago

At about 9:30 AM yesterday, a shooting assassination occurred suddenly at the entrance of the China Xingye Vacuum Flask Factory at 315 Tongfu Road. The victim was Zhang Qingfa, the general manager of the factory, who was shot in the neck. The bullet exited from the back of his neck, and he died of serious injuries. In addition, an elderly Yang woman, who was buying vegetables, was also shot and killed. The bullet entered her right breast and did not exit. After firing two shots, the perpetrator fled into the Da Zhong Li neighborhood, where he was apprehended by the police after they fired shots. After investigating the situation, the details are recorded below.

Ambushed on the Way to the Factory

Zhang Qingfa, a Ningbo native, was 44 years old, married to Ji, who is 43 years old. They have three sons and two daughters and live together at 41, Lane 116, Chengdu Road. Zhang has been the manager of the China Xingye Vacuum Flask Factory at 315 Tongfu Road for many years. Yesterday morning, Zhang finished breakfast at his residence, wearing a gray serge flannel robe and white cloth shoes. He routinely took a rickshaw to the factory to work, pulled by rickshaw puller Yang Chunsheng. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw passed the entrance of Renrui Li on Tongfu Road, a man wearing a blue striped short shirt, about 30 years old, ambushed there with a weapon and fired two shots at Zhang in succession. Zhang was caught off guard and was shot once, the bullet penetrating his head. Blood gushed out instantly, and he fell on the rickshaw. Before long, he died.

Old Woman Dies Tragically; Murderer Apprehended

After achieving his purpose, the perpetrator fled south on Tongfu Road, desperately trying to escape. When he crossed the road and tried to escape into the Da Zhong Li neighborhood, an elderly woman, Yang (66 years old, from Changzhou, living at 12, Lane 199, Mu'erming Road), happened to be coming out of the neighborhood with a vegetable basket and bumped into the perpetrator. In his haste, the perpetrator shot the elderly woman in the right breast, and she soon died. At this time, the auxiliary police in Da Zhong Li heard the gunshots and rushed out, joining the Chinese police from the Three Roads, and apprehended the perpetrator in Da Zhong Li. A six-shot revolver was seized from him on the spot, with four bullets in the chamber. A rescue ambulance was immediately called to send the bodies of the man and woman to the morgue of the Baolong Hospital for autopsy.

Assistant Manager and Manager Both Shot

It was found that Chen Changkun (34 years old, from Shaoxing), the assistant manager of the China Xingye Vacuum Flask Factory, was also shot dead on September 18 of this year. However, the perpetrator escaped on the spot and disappeared without a trace. Unexpectedly, two and a half months later, at about 9:00 AM yesterday, the general manager was also shot dead. Therefore, the case is very bizarre. The perpetrator reportedly claimed to be Xu Wenyuan, from Changzhou, 28 years old. His other statements were vague, and the police are currently conducting a thorough investigation.

### Hand Grenade Found in Front of Asia America Company

At 7:30 AM yesterday, a hand grenade was found on the roadside in front of the repair department of the Asia America Wireless Radio Company at 846 Foch Road, diagonally across from the Jinmen Grand Theater at the intersection of Seymour Road. Fortunately, it did not explode and injure anyone. After the police in charge learned of this, they dispatched officers to drive to the scene and remove the dangerous item.

Looking for Owner of Wallet Dear Editor, at 5:00 PM on December on a tram going north to the North Railway Station outside Wing On Company, a wallet was found on the car. It contained 62 yuan in cash, a rice industry association badge, and other parts. Because I was in a hurry to get off the car, I gave the item entirely to the ticket seller number 707 on the car. I hope you can publish this on my behalf so that the lost owner can get the item back. Thank you. Sincerely, Wang Su'e and Su Lan, December 5.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong and the surrounding areas and here are sunny and cold, with southwest to northwest winds. The coastal area south of Ma'anshan Island will change from cloudy to overcast, with gentle north to northeast winds and localized morning fog. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the port was 57.0 degrees and the lowest was 34.9 degrees.

### Fudan University: Shanghai Campus to Maintain Original Status

Due to the westward retreat of the National Army, the private Fudan University relocated entirely to Beibei, Chongqing. A portion of students from Jiangsu and Zhejiang who remained in Shanghai, to avoid wasting their studies, specially obtained permission from President Li Denghui to manage academic affairs in Shanghai, so that they could continue their studies. Over the past three to five years, with the hard work of President Li, the Shanghai campus has gradually returned to its former state. However, with Fudan in Beibei, Chongqing, facing difficulty in maintaining funding, and the Executive Yuan resolving to nationalize it, the situation of the Shanghai campus has attracted much attention from all parties. According to reliable sources, the Shanghai campus will not be affected in any way by the changes in Fudan in Beibei. President Li will continue to maintain the status quo.

### Continuous Short Selling: Yarn Market Deteriorates Daily

Yesterday's yarn market, which experienced a sharp decline, continued its downward trend yesterday, and the bearish sentiment remained strong. This was due to the increasingly abundant supply of short selling chips. At the same time, the unfavorable environment and deteriorating situation made it difficult for the market to maintain stability. However, some profit-takers made slight adjustments, leading to a slightly bullish atmosphere. As a result, rollover bulls initially posted eight to ten yuan. Eventually, both sides closed their positions, causing the market to rebound by several tens of yuan. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 2,325 yuan, the low price was 2,170 yuan, and the closing price was 1,190 yuan. There was a rumor that off-exchange trading reached 2,230 yuan. Due to the end of the week, the market was traditionally closed in the afternoon.

The Shuangma factory started the morning with a slightly bullish outlook, up 35 yuan, opening at 2,325 yuan. At this time, sellers on the floor remained eager. Shortly after, the price fell to 2,270 yuan. However, the opening decline at the exchange was still moderate, and the price rose again to 2,315 yuan. Unexpectedly, short selling resumed at the higher price, and the market weakened again, gradually falling to 2,170 yuan. The closing price rebounded to 2,190 yuan. According to statistics, 2,650 bales were traded in half a day.

The futures market for Jin Shuangma continued to decline. Investor sentiment was extremely volatile. The bulls were afraid to hold positions for long and were eager to exit the market. The market weakened after initially stabilizing, and the exchange experienced another downturn. Large investors dumped their holdings, and small investors also sold. The selling pressure on the floor was quite strong, resulting in a severe squeeze on the market. The opening prices for December, January, and February were 2,350 yuan, 2,440 yuan, and 2,450 yuan, respectively. There was a brief rebound at one point, but the market was ultimately unable to withstand the pressure from sellers and was forced lower again. As a result, the prices for the current and subsequent months fell by 60 yuan each, and the price for January also fell by 50 yuan. A table is provided below.

The spot cotton market lacked activity, and market conditions remained dull as usual.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to speculative selling and long liquidation, but later rebounded due to political news from Washington, progress in Japanese-American negotiations, and active short covering. As a result, prices rose by about 20 points each.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to short selling by cotton merchants and sales by European exporters, but then rebounded due to speculative buying. Finally, the market fell due to profit-taking by long positions. Yesterday, prices fell by about one rupee each. It is predicted that the market will open higher by two rupees today.

### Piece Goods Selling Pressure Remains Strong: Selling Continues Downward

Yesterday's factory cloth market continued to decline due to the unstable situation, relaxed investor sentiment, and persistent selling pressure. The selling prices for bleached, unbleached, and coarse cloths fell by 5 jiao to 1.5 yuan. There was little new business in dyed cloths, and prices also weakened. Wholesale shops on the street maintained a wait-and-see attitude, with approximately 100 pieces traded. There were 50 to 60 pieces of colored and coarse cloths from the Ningbo and Dinghai groups in eastern Zhejiang.

In the eastern cloth market, the continued decline in yarn prices caused buyers to hold back, resulting in a further downturn in the market. The exchange's standard price for colored ball fine cloth for the current month fell by 1.8 yuan, closing at 81 yuan in the afternoon. The closing prices for January and February were 84.5 yuan and 86.49 yuan, respectively, indicating a decline of only 7 to 7.1 jiao, which suggests a pattern of near-term weakness and long-term strength. Therefore, the prices in the spot market remained relatively stable. The opening price for leading fine cloth from the factory fluctuated between 86 and 87 yuan, but after Shuangma's sharp decline, the price once fell to 85.75 yuan. Ultimately, due to the small volume of sales, the price rebounded to 86 yuan at the close, down 7.5 jiao per piece. Jiao Junzi serge fell by 1.5 fen, with a closing price of 3.075 yuan.

### Hong Kong Banks Replenish: Gold Market Stabilizes

Yesterday, the cash gold market (both official and unofficial) turned stable and firm. Prices fluctuated around 14,000 yuan. Investor sentiment remained uncertain. Hong Kong banks continued to replenish their holdings. Xiangxing Yongjin purchased 300 taels, Gonghe purchased 210 taels, and Chengji and a certain securities firm each purchased 140 taels. However, Tianyuan sold 460 taels. The securities firm that sold heavily on behalf of the Korean banks in the previous two days sold another 210 taels. Mingfeng sold 170 taels, and Yongcheng sold 110 taels. The selling pressure shifted from weak to strong, causing the price to rise from 13,500 yuan to 14,200 yuan, before falling back. The closing price only edged up by 130 yuan. A total of 9,340 taels were traded in half a day. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. Jewelry gold also rebounded sharply after rising, gaining 10 yuan. Silver ingots remained weak in both official and unofficial trading.

### Black Market Exchange Rates Difficult to Sell Unless Low

The official exchange rates of HSBC and the Central Bank remained unchanged. The black market exchange rate showed a slight weakening, as rumors of British troops deploying on the Thai border led to renewed selling interest from Chinese merchants. Offers to a certain import firm were priced at 3.875 yuan, for approximately 2,000-3,000 US dollars. At one point, it was difficult to sell unless the rate was low, except for those who could draw accounts at Chase Bank. Importers who were not allowed to apply for foreign exchange purchased at the lower rate. At noon, the market turned soft again. The selling prices at noon were 3.125 yuan for British exchange and 3.625 yuan for US dollars. The buying prices required a premium of 2.4375 yuan for British exchange and 3.875 yuan for US dollars, an increase of 0.0625 yuan for British exchange and 0.125 yuan for US dollars compared to the previous day.

Yesterday, the British and American exchange rates remained stable. British gold certificates also remained unchanged. American gold certificates once retreated to 27.8 yuan, but ultimately closed at 28.6 yuan, an increase of 0.6 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong certificates showed little change. Japanese gold certificates rose to 2.5 yuan. Japanese military certificates rose to 3.15 yuan. Korean certificates trended weaker, retreating to 2 yuan in evening trading.

### Domestic Bonds Mostly Liquidation Trading

The unofficial market for government bonds was slightly higher yesterday. Trading in the market remained relatively light, with both bulls and bears liquidating positions. Statistics on new trades showed that large long positions remained largely unchanged. Environmental news remained confusing. The Japanese-American negotiations remained inconclusive. Opinions varied widely, and the outlook likely remained one of consolidation. Yesterday was Saturday, with only a morning session. Trading opened at 11:00 AM. The opening prices for Class C bonds were not favorable. However, after Tongyi, Lianhe, Runde, Jiufeng, and others bought in, there were more buyers than sellers from Tianxing, Hongda, Runde, and Yichang, causing market prices to stabilize slightly. However, most of the trading was for bulls and bears to liquidate positions. Market prices generally rebounded by 0.15 to 0.7 yuan. Approximately 600,000 to 700,000 yuan were traded. A concise table is provided below.

Stock trading: Five shares of Wing On Textile Factory were traded at a price of 467.5 yuan per share.

### Foreign Flour Already Turned Flat

The market conditions for foreign flour remained tight. Actual sales on this street were unabated, but customers and retailers were no longer as greedy as in previous days. This was due to the weakening currency, easing situation, and return of investor confidence. Jinlong flour in Puxi once opened at 42.5 to 43 yuan. Australian and American flours were around 45 yuan. It is estimated that 2,000-3,000 bags were handled by actual sales firms on this street. Those holding bran remained very firm, but after Sanxin and others released 10,000 bags, the supply in the market gradually increased, and the market stabilized.

There was no market for foreign rice. There was also a lack of formal trading in domestic rice. However, there was still a small amount of scattered supply of domestic rice, but the amount decreased yesterday, totaling only 40-50 bags.

Yesterday, the market conditions for miscellaneous grains turned stable. The supply and demand for edible oil were both scarce, with only slight fluctuations in prices. Soybean trading was light, and the market remained firm. Corn was also flat. Wholesale sales included 30 barrels of Dasu soybean oil, 50 barrels of Tianjin soybean oil, 400 dan of Dayou factory clear oil, 200 barrels of Rihua factory rapeseed oil, more than 100 bags of Tianjin Chen Jinyuan, more than 1,000 bags of corn spot, and more than 300 barrels of corn futures.

### Spot Sugar Consolidates Upwards

Yesterday, the futures market for sugar remained suspended. Although there was not much trading in the spot market, the market turned tight, rising by 3-5 yuan. However, Taikoo Granulated White B mark alone rose by 8 yuan. Spot 24 Coarse White for November import initially flat, then tight, at 177 yuan, 184 yuan, 180 yuan, and 182 yuan in the morning; 182 yuan, 184 yuan, and 183.5 yuan in the afternoon. October was 178 yuan, 182 yuan, 175 yuan, and 178 yuan in the morning; 180 yuan, 183 yuan, and 182 yuan in the afternoon. September was 170 yuan, 174 yuan, and 175 yuan; August was 172 yuan to 171 yuan. Hong Kong coarse was 172 yuan, 173 yuan, and 174 yuan. Dutch red was 160 yuan, 162 yuan, and 163 yuan. Taikoo Granulated White B mark was 198 yuan, HX mark was 186 yuan. A total of more than 4,000 bags of spot were traded.

### Hongji White Coal: Only Sold to Foreigners

Only foreigners can get oil permits to purchase kerosene. It seems that every Chinese person is hoarding oil, and now there is a sigh that it is not easy to buy. It is already extremely painful. Unexpectedly, Hongji White Coal is also clearly and obviously only sold to foreigners and not to Chinese. Yesterday, when buying coal at the sales office on Laurier East Road, there was a mountain of coal in stock. The coal-crushing machine rumbled non-stop. The sample coal baskets were lined up as usual. However, the clerk refused to sell, saying to go to the Bund to buy. When I got to the Bund, there was a foreigner buying coal. The Chinese clerk greeted him warmly, sold him two baskets of coal for twenty yuan each, and sent it to a certain apartment. The sales office has always been very picky about banknotes for coal sales. They must be banknotes from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. Chinese Farmers Bank notes, which are also legal tender, are refused. However, the foreigner's payment included two ten-yuan banknotes from the Chinese Farmers Bank. Initially, the Chinese clerk grumbled a bit, but the foreigner ignored him and eventually they were accepted. So, I also tried to buy two baskets of coal from him. He said, "You are Chinese, you cannot buy." When I asked why, he said it was only sold to foreigners. When I asked why it was not sold to Chinese, the Chinese employee remained silent. There was also another person buying coal next to me, who questioned him, "Yesterday I came to buy, and you said come tomorrow morning. Now I come to buy, and you say you won't sell. It's too unreasonable to treat people like this." Actually, it's pointless to say such things. Using Chinese foreign exchange to buy coal, it turns out that only foreigners have the right to buy it. Why talk so much?

### Black Fungus Rebounds Weakly

Although the supply of black fungus has been scarce recently, the demand from all parties has also been low. Therefore, market prices have gradually weakened. The previous higher-priced goods had to be sold for 2,400-2,500 yuan, but now the market has gradually fallen to the range of 2,000 yuan. However, reputable firms are still holding firm and selling less, due to the lack of supply.

### Tea (3)

— Gao Jiannong

… "How is mutton compared to fish soup? How is cheese compared to tea?" He replied, "Mutton is like the great state of Qi and Lu, fish is like the small state of Ju, but tea is not fit to be a slave to cheese."... This section also says: "The Supervising Secretary Liu Hao admired the austere customs of Su and specialized in drinking tea. The Prince of Pengcheng said to Hao: 'You do not admire the delicacies of kings and nobles, but you like the water and misfortune of a lowly servant. There are those who pursue foul smells on the sea, and those who imitate Xi Shi in the village, you are one of them!' ... From then on, nobles in court gatherings, although they set out tea, were all ashamed to eat it again, only the refugees who came to surrender from Jiangbiao drank it." From this we can know that the northern scholars and officials at this time still considered drinking tea to be shameful, and only "the refugees who came to surrender from Jiangbiao drank it." It is undoubtedly true that the custom of drinking tea was not yet widespread.

In 589 AD, the Sui Dynasty destroyed Chen and unified China, breaking through the boundaries of the north and south. Thus, all old customs, which before could be "you are you and I am I," at this time, with the development of political power, were also stirred, rubbed, and slowly assimilated and merged. The mere custom of drinking tea was of course no exception. However, what further accelerated and promoted its popularity was the power of the monarch or individuals to vigorously promote it. According to the Book of Sui (To be continued)

### A Teacher Said: "I Would Rather Be Hated First and Then Thanked"

— Yuan Shan

When each semester begins, many children will try to find out who the new homeroom teacher is. If the new homeroom teacher is very lenient with homework, then they are overjoyed; otherwise, if they are very strict, then they are unhappy.

I remember a homeroom teacher I had before said to us: "Many students are happy when they encounter a teacher who is very lenient with homework; when they encounter a teacher who is very strict with homework, they are very unhappy. However, I do not want to be the former teacher but want to be the latter, because only when homework is taken seriously will students be willing to work hard and make progress. When they go to work in society in the future, they will be able to develop their strengths and will not feel hardship. Therefore, I would rather be hated by you first and then thanked by you." He also said: "Smart and hardworking students will not hate teachers who are strict."

Dear children! Do you like a teacher who is lenient with homework, or do you like a teacher who is strict?

### The Farmer and A-San

— Jin Ge

Once upon a time, there was a very poor farmer. One day, he obtained thirty taels of silver. So that night, he thought for a long time about where to hide the silver.

First, he put the silver on the bed, but after sleeping for a while, he felt it was not appropriate. So he moved the silver from the bed into a box. But after sleeping for a while, he thought that the box was also not appropriate, so he got up again and hid the silver in a jar under the bed. However, sleeping until later, he felt that putting it in the jar was still not a good idea. Finally, he put the silver in the gap in the broken wall, and wrote the words "No silver here, thirty taels" on the wall outside. After writing this, he fell asleep peacefully.

The next day, while he was working in the field, his neighbor A-San went to his house. After seeing the words on the wall, he stole the silver. At the same time, fearing that the farmer would inquire, he also wrote the words "A-San next door did not steal it" on the wall.

Children, I believe you have all heard this common story! But please tell me, who is the smarter one between the two of them?

### Pig's Confession

— Ye Qizhou

A pig with a fat head and big ears was locked in a pigsty all day long and could not get freedom. But it was very satisfied with its life, thinking that it was the only one in the world living an easy life. So when its friend - the dog - came to visit it, it would always say proudly:

"Hey! Brother Dog, look how easy my life is! I have food to eat whenever I want, and after eating, I sleep. Someone also arranges my sleeping place for me. Look, how clean my residence is, the owner sweeps it for me! Haha!"

The dog was not envious at all, but warned it: "Brother Pig, don't be proud. I'm telling you, your doom is coming! Your owner is going to kill you! I advise you to come with me and live a free life!"

How could it be willing? It was willing to live its easy life. It thought, "The owner treats me so well, how could he kill me?"

But one day, when two butchers came in, grabbed its ears, dragged it out, tied it to a stool, and were about to kill it, it finally realized the truth. So it began to confess. .

"Alas! If only I had known there would be such a day, I regret that I only knew how to enjoy myself and did not know how to work, like Brother Dog who lives freely by his own efforts! If only I had gone out with it that day to live a free life, I would not be in this situation today! Now, I understand: those who rely on others for their survival will eventually perish at the hands of others!"

Interview with Entertainers

### Tang Yuqing, a Newcomer on the Stage: An Excellent Actor from Kunming

— Yuan Shen

Tang Yuqing is a typical robust young man with rough lines. He is from Hebei and is twenty-three years old this year. He used to study at Qingdao Municipal Middle School and was a classmate of Cao Yu at Nankai in Tianjin. He is very straightforward, and he cherishes the discussion of dramatic theory as he cherishes his life.

He started acting at the age of seventeen. His first play was "Parasitic Grass." At that time, he was still young and didn't understand anything. He walked on the stage and spoke boldly to the audience below. When he heard a burst of applause, he felt even more flustered in his heart. However, he still recited his lines and performed his actions until the end. This lesson made him understand drama more deeply. He knew that acting was not an easy task, and he was determined to study hard and seek more knowledge from all aspects.

After that, he acted in many plays in Qingdao and Tianjin, such as "A Play," "Eliminate Superstition," "Death," and "Spring Breeze Autumn Rain." Last year, he also staged "The Wilderness," "Phoenix City," "Night Light Cup," "Yue Fei," and "The Nation Above All" at Southwest Associated University in Kunming. According to him, during the several days of acting in "Yue Fei," he fainted twice backstage. He shed tears and felt an indescribable excitement in his heart, because he had already placed his inspiration in this play. He forgot who was acting on stage, he only knew that the living story was standing in front of everyone. Yuqing only came to Shanghai this year. He first joined the amateur theater company. In terms of acting skills, he has a unique style like Shi Hui. Naturally, this is not the achievement of a day or two, it is the result of many years of hard work. Recently, through the introduction of Huang Zongjiang, he joined the Shanghai Professional Theater Company, and played the old man in the play "Fengwa." Speaking of the relationship, Huang Zuolin was Tang Yuqing's teacher at Tianjin New School, and Huang Zongjiang was his childhood classmate. Sports and music are both his favorite things. He is also an expert at playing the harmonica.

### Four Major Theater Companies Discuss Script Tax: Cao Yu's Demands Too Extravagant

The four major theater companies, Shanghai Drama Society, Shanghai Professional Theater Company, Tianfeng Theater Company, and China Traveling Theater Company, recently sent representatives to hold a joint meeting to discuss the issue of script tax. This was because Cao Yu's two plays, "Metamorphosis" and "Peking Man," were successively performed by the "Shanghai Professional Theater Company" and the "Shanghai Drama Society." At the same time, lawyer Sun Zuji, representing Cao Yu, announced that he intended to collect a script tax of 20% for the first performance and 10% for subsequent performances. Therefore, the theater companies discussed mutually a proper and reasonable way to solve this problem. According to the script tax, which has always been 3% in our country, even the world's great playwright George Bernard Shaw only charged 15%.

Chapter 19: Dusk, the City Filled with the Dust of the Nomad Cavalry

The wind was getting stronger that day. Wu Sangui's second batch of proclamations had also been sent to the capital, instructing the people in the capital to quickly tie up Li Zicheng and present him before the army, to be rewarded with a thousand gold and a noble title. Li Zicheng was even more resentful after learning about this. He ran to Chen Yuanyuan's room. Yuanyuan was sitting alone, full of melancholy with nowhere to tell. She was as the poet said, "Silently thinking, unable to fly away," only regretting that she did not have a pair of wings, otherwise she would have already flown out of this gloomy Beijing city and flown into the arms of General Wu on the Shanhaiguan Pass. At this moment, she saw Li Zicheng walking in, his footsteps heavier than usual, and Li Zicheng's face was even more angry, his eyebrows furrowed, and his two big cheeks bulging, filled with a face of murderous intent. She knew that Li Zicheng could not stand still, and would flee in panic sooner or later. Her own fate happened to be at a critical moment of survival, so she had to be careful. She stood up her delicate body and pretended to welcome him, saying, "Your Majesty has not enjoyed himself for many days, please sit down." Li Zicheng darkened his face and said, "Don't be hypocritical, you must be very happy in your heart these days." Yuanyuan pretended to be demented and smiled enchantingly, "Your concubine is happy every day by His Majesty's side, why say these few days are happy? However, Your Majesty has been toiling in the wind and dust, and when you return to the capital, you should have a good rest." Li Zicheng waved his hand and said, "Don't talk about it. That boy Wu is himself without the courage, but he invited the Qing soldiers to help, causing my army to be defeated. Now they are advancing rapidly, pressing me hard, the soldiers are under the city, it is very dangerous, we are going to retreat." (238)
