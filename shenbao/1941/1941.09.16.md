### Foreign Minister Guo's Statement Yesterday: Awaiting the Outcome of US-Japan Talks

Firmly Believes the US Will Not Abandon Its Fundamental Policies; Details of Gauss's Visit with Guo Not Announced

Reuters, Chongqing, 15th - Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, this afternoon, detailed the US-Japan discussions to news reporters, saying, "I wish to reiterate that the Chinese people trust that the United States will not abandon its repeatedly announced, and faithfully implemented in the Far East and Pacific, fundamental policies. China trusts that the US has no intention of negotiating anything at China's expense. If it joins discussions that affect China or its rights, it will certainly fully consult with China so that China can express its views on any proposed solutions. I dare say that the US is very willing to listen to what China has to say. Regarding the news circulating about US-Japan discussions, some of it is speculative, and some is intended to cause fear among the Chinese. However, such tactics have become commonplace and will not achieve their purpose. Some say that the US-Japan discussions are merely 'exploratory,' seeking a common ground for resolution. It should be understood that this ground is very difficult to find." When a reporter asked about China's minimum peace conditions with Japan, Guo replied that Generalissimo Chiang's recent remarks announced that China would continue to resist until a permanent and fair peace is achieved in the Far East. "These remarks may be considered very broad, but when considered in their full context, they have their meaning." Guo mentioned the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the recent US-British declaration, saying that China accepts them all, and that he does not believe that there is a possibility of a resolution between the US and Japan that does not involve China. Guo concluded by saying that China is now closely watching the outcome of these discussions, and firmly believes that the interests of China and other countries resisting aggression will be protected.

Reuters, Chongqing, 15th - US Ambassador Gauss visited Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi this morning, but the content of their conversation was not announced.

United Press, Chongqing, 15th - Foreign Minister Dr. Guo Taiqi officially told foreign reporters today that China is closely awaiting the results of the US-Japan talks in Washington, and is confident that the interests of China and the interests of all countries resisting aggression will be protected. He said, "I am confident that the United States will consult with China before reaching any solution that affects the Pacific." When asked if he thought a solution could be reached without mentioning China at all, he replied "No." He also said, "We believe that the political, moral, and material interests of China and the United States are closely intertwined, so any question regarding China in general or any particular situation should be discussed fully, frankly, and amicably." He also emphasized that this commonality of interests exists not only between China and the US, but also among all anti-aggression countries. Foreign Minister Guo revealed that US Ambassador Gauss visited him this morning to maintain contact. However, Foreign Minister Guo did not announce the contents of their conversation. He pointed out that there have been many rumors about the US-Japan talks, some speculative, some inspired. The latter type of news is intended to cause panic and doubt among the Chinese people, but the Chinese people have learned this method through painful experience, and are familiar with these tactics. This method has not achieved its desired purpose, because the Chinese people are generally not deceived by it. I personally wish to reiterate China's conviction that the United States will definitely not violate its repeatedly announced fundamental doctrines and policies. I should say that the US has always faithfully followed these doctrines and policies, especially regarding the Far East.

Taiwan Public News Agency, Washington, 15th - Reliable diplomats stated yesterday that the United States and Japan have entered into a "tacit agreement of understanding," to maintain peace in the Pacific, at least temporarily. The diplomats said that the two countries do not yet have a genuine agreement, and are only exploring the possibility of some practical understanding. The diplomats also said that "the mere fact that the two countries have decided to study the possibility of concessions itself constitutes a tacit arrangement of understanding." They said that there is genuine importance behind this "arrangement": (1) Anti-American voices in Japanese newspapers have decreased in recent days; (2) When President Roosevelt gave a speech on the freedom of the seas, he only mentioned the names of other Axis countries without mentioning Japan. It was also said that the so-called "standstill" means that the Japanese government will try to avoid further acts of aggression, neither advancing south into Thailand, nor advancing north to attack the Soviet Union, nor intercepting US ships aiding the Soviet Union. At the same time, Japan will not interfere with the US Atlantic program. As for the US side, President Roosevelt will temporarily refrain from taking new actions to economically strangle Japan, such as embargoes. These diplomats also said that this arrangement is not fixed and can change dramatically at any time. However, influential figures in both countries believe that, for the time being, this matter is satisfactory and feasible because it can be used to enter into exploratory discussions and avoid armed conflict between the two countries. According to informed sources, the explosive danger lies on the Japanese side, because radical patriots in that country may stage a revolt against the current government. Since news spread that the Japanese Emperor openly took the unusual step of supporting the government's policies, the danger of such a revolt has greatly diminished. The Japanese Emperor is respected by the people, and according to Japanese tradition, the Emperor is no different from a god. The Emperor's views can control public opinion, unless some of the Emperor's advisors have contrary views that influence the Emperor. It is believed that the two countries will now conduct informal discussions on various issues, such as the war in China, shipping freeze orders, embargoes, etc., to seek a basis for reaching a complete understanding.

Reuters, Chongqing, 15th - Chinese opposition to appeasement of Japan is becoming increasingly apparent. This afternoon, Foreign Minister Guo will make a statement on this when he receives news reporters. The Central Daily News carried a lengthy article saying that regardless of whether Japan leaves the Axis powers, it will not abandon its opportunism and policy of aggression. Japan is discussing conditions with the United States because it is exhausted from four years of war against China and feels the impact of British and American economic pressure. If the anti-aggression front is to achieve victory, we must thoroughly understand every component of the Axis camp and must not focus too much on one part of the grand plan of overall resolution and ignore other parts. Only this can achieve lasting peace. It concludes, "Adhere to moral obligations."

### US Military Mission Crosses the Atlantic; Arrives in London by Bomber; Roosevelt to Request Appropriation of Funds to Aid Britain

United Press, London, 15th - The government announced yesterday that Soviet Ambassador to the US, Umansky, and members of the US mission to Moscow arrived here after sailing across the Atlantic. The leader of the mission, Harriman, and other members are expected to arrive between the beginning of the week. The mission arrived in London aboard a large bomber. US Ambassador Winant and senior British military officials were present to welcome them. One plane carried former US military attach√© to Moscow, Colonel Fafmonville, Colonel Gross, Lieutenant Ensign Wilson, Lieutenant Ensign Kirk, and government petroleum expert Dr. Brownell and John Potter. The other plane carried Umansky, Captain Burt, Captain Brienne, and Edward Tert. Most of the personnel had chocolate with them. They will remain for some time, awaiting Harriman's orders. According to reliable sources here, the Duke of Kent, who was on a tour of Canada, has returned to England on the same plane as Umansky.

Reuters, London, 15th - Junior members of the US mission to Moscow and Soviet Ambassador to the US, Umansky, have flown across the Atlantic and arrived in London.

Reuters, Washington, 15th - When Congress reconvenes today, President Roosevelt may request an appropriation of approximately $5 billion in new funds to aid Britain and other countries fighting Germany. It is expected that the President will first report to Congress on the expenditure of the $7 billion in Lend-Lease funds. The President's first report on Lend-Lease funds was submitted to Congress in June, when the President stated that $1.75 billion had already been paid out. The first item of business for the House of Representatives today will be the $3.585 billion tax bill. Meanwhile, the Senate will handle the Interstate Commerce Subcommittee, investigating accusations that the film industry is widely disseminating propaganda to draw the United States into the war. Representatives of film producers, Wilkie, have requested that films by Senators Nye and Clark, which allegedly contain war propaganda, be submitted to the Commerce Subcommittee for review. Movie star Charlie Chaplin has received a subpoena to appear on October 6 to give his opinion on his film "The Great Dictator."

### Thai Government Statement: Defend National Territory

United Press, Bangkok, 15th - The government issued an order today stating that Thailand is determined to resist any aggression, and will not stop fighting until the last person. It also stated that every Thai person has the responsibility to kill the enemy. Any enemy that violates the territorial integrity of Thailand will be strenuously resisted and killed by the Thai people. The order has been published in the newspapers and orders all Thais to use all possible means to prevent the enemy from invading Thai soil. Those who violate the order will be punished with death or life imprisonment.

### US Warships to Protect Convoys Under Lend-Lease Act; Secretary of the Navy Knox Delivers Speech: Sink Axis Ships on Sight

Reuters, Milwaukee, 15th - Secretary of the Navy Knox, in a speech at the American Legion conference here today, said that starting tomorrow, the US Navy will protect all Lend-Lease goods passing through the sea between the Americas and Iceland. The Atlantic Fleet has been ordered to capture or destroy any Axis surface or submarine raiders encountered. "This is our response to Hitler's declaration that he will sink every ship traveling on the route from the US to British ports." Near the end of his speech, he said that since the US occupied Iceland on July 7, Hitler and the Nazis have clearly been losing the war in the Atlantic, and have had to try to destroy the lifeline of ships carrying supplies to Britain. "If Hitler and the Nazis do not take this swift action, defeating Britain will be impossible. However, making this desperate effort will mean adding the US Navy to his many enemies. This is indeed a difficult choice, but the actions of the Nazis in the past few days have clearly indicated their future direction." He also recounted the attack on the US destroyer Greer by a German submarine, and expressed surprise at the pro-German remarks made by the "America First" Committee. In his speech, he did not use the term "convoy," but said that starting tomorrow (Tuesday), the US Navy will provide full protection to ships of all countries carrying Lend-Lease supplies.

United Press, Milwaukee, 15th - Secretary of the Navy Knox said at the American Legion convention here that starting tomorrow, under the direction of President Roosevelt, the United States must be ordered to protect or destroy Axis submarines and surface raiders by all means in the area between the US continent and Iceland. It was pointed out that Hitler, facing defeat in the Atlantic war, will certainly take every opportunity to prevent this from happening. Therefore, Germany will attack US ships. It was also said that the US Navy has always fought for freedom of the seas, the US Navy is now fighting for this important principle, and the officers and soldiers engaged in this great war are adhering to this important principle, and everyone has unanimously agreed with the US view. The Secretary of the Navy also said that the German submarine's attack on the US destroyer Greer on September 9 was a risky move, because Britain's success in the Atlantic war is growing, and since the US occupied Iceland and established Atlantic sea and air patrols, the effectiveness of Britain's attacks on the Axis forces has increased. Britain implemented a new plan on July 1, and since changing to the new plan, Britain's shipping losses have immediately been greatly reduced. Hitler and the Nazis have probably already failed in the Atlantic. If the Axis countries cannot quickly win in the Atlantic war, defeating the US may be impossible.

United Press, Rome, 15th - Gaeta wrote in the Italian newspaper "The Voice of Italy" yesterday that President Roosevelt's policy of shooting Axis ships on sight is because he believes that Britain and the Soviet Union will not be able to win this war without direct American intervention. Gaeta also reiterated the accusations he had made weeks earlier, saying that American submarines had been operating in the Mediterranean for a long time. Gaeta also said, "The Axis powers are not afraid. They expect that all citizens will fulfill their responsibilities and will respond to gunfire with gunfire. Until now, they have only responded with words." He said, "Everything has now been proven. President Roosevelt's deliberate goal of aggression, he even tried to use national security and freedom of the high seas as excuses to cover up his goal. The civilized world, upon hearing that the Mediterranean was also included in the US national defense waters, was confused. Therefore, we can know the correct scope of President Roosevelt's goal of aggression, but we are not surprised that the Mediterranean is included. Our readers will recall that we asked our readers to pay attention to US submarines and other war equipment being used against Italy in the Mediterranean weeks ago."

German Raiders Operating at Entrance to Panama

Reuters, New York, 15th - The New York Times' Balboa correspondent reports that an Axis raider is operating near the Galapagos Islands, 47.210 miles from Ecuador, and at the entrance to Panama. Many ships that have recently arrived in Balboa have reported receiving radio signals from attacked vessels. Although the names of these ships have not been announced, several ships from the Dutch East Indies and New Zealand have not arrived overdue. The Dutch ship Kodani Ben is also among them and is believed to have sunk near the Galapagos Islands. It is generally believed that Ecuador has not adequately protected the island, or that it has been used as a base of operations by raiders.

### US Large Fleet of Cargo Ships Test Sailing in Both Oceans

### Duke of Kent Returns to England

Editorial

### Malthus' Population Theory and Economic Provision

Malthus's population theory originated in the late eighteenth century. Although extracting a passage out of context and nitpicking, it has stood firm to this day and increasingly aligns with the current situation. His foresight is worthy of admiration. Examining his theory, the gist is simple. Based on observations of large population numbers, Malthus believed that the continued increase in population would erode material provision and lead to scarcity. Only when economic pressure becomes unbearable will population growth be curbed. Once population growth stagnates, material provision is restored and increased, and population growth continues accordingly. This cycle of mutual generation and mutual restraint continues indefinitely. Without other resistance, population growth would inevitably increase geometrically, doubling every twenty-five years, while the increase in material provision is only arithmetic. The reproductive capacity of the former is far beyond the reach of the latter. Therefore, measures such as raising living standards and improving social systems are doomed to failure without the support of sufficient economic provision, and the future of mankind is truly bleak and sad.

However, population growth is not without hidden resistance that controls it. Practicing moral restraint or implementing birth control are good preventive policies, because reducing the birth rate is the way to avoid population growth. Although Malthus worked hard to promote it, society at the time did not approve. Therefore, the only effective resistance that followed was disease and disaster, which are ways to increase mortality, especially war, which is the most cruel and effective shortcut to massacre living beings.

Since the eighteenth century, the spread of disease and the constant wars have been the biggest reasons for population loss, which validates Malthus's theory. However, the criticisms of later generations are because the progress of modern production technology and the rapid increase in productivity are enough to support the increase in population, which Malthus did not anticipate. This is certainly a flaw. However, generally speaking, although the wars in various countries over the years have had various justifications, their main purpose is nothing more than to compete for economic provision, which is due to population growth and economic pressure.

Before the recurrence of the European war, Germany repeatedly attacked Britain for having many territories, such as Canada and India, where the population is sparse, which Britain did not need. At the same time, it explained that Germany's population was crowded and provision was insufficient, so it urgently needed to find another living area. The United States does not deny the threat of population growth, but advocates using economic methods to solve it: such as actively improving agricultural production technology. Multiple yields can be harvested on the same unit of land; changing the effectiveness of surplus crops or other products, such as drawing silk from coal to replace natural silk, using sweet potato flour to make sugar and paper, etc.; and using previously unattempted wild fruits and other foods. The United States also believes that if Germany is willing to adopt this production method, there will be no shortage of provision, and it can support more people, so there is no need to provoke others to promote its policy of aggression. Before the start of the European war, the British writer Wells had already loudly called for the increase in population, especially the increase in males, which would inevitably cause war to seek to relieve the threat of population crowding. But looking at the abundance of material provision in the world, if it can be distributed through common cooperation, everyone can enjoy a prosperous life. But the world does not do this, but must engage in the path of slaughter. How can this be the happiness of mankind!

Then, what can be cherished about Malthus's theory is that it predicts that mankind will be economically dominated, like spinning a cocoon and trapping oneself, eating one's own fruit, and being unable to extricate or save oneself. Economically wealthy countries that can be self-sufficient still seek to open up colonies as the tail end of the surplus population, and the original residents will inevitably be squeezed out, forced to move to make a living, and eventually die out and be eliminated. Therefore, natural selection and survival of the fittest are only a synonym for the strong preying on the weak. The strong still seek more provision and breed more people, while the weak are invisibly slaughtered by them, unable to withstand economic pressure and perish. Finally, there is the mutual killing between the strong, and then the division between the superior and the inferior, and the people who can preserve their lives must be the most excellent nation. This is our morning bell and evening drum and the lesson shown by Malthus. The movement of population and the adjustment of economy in various countries after this war will be serious problems. Our country is even more in urgent need of planning ahead due to the great war losses, the huge needs of reconstruction and construction, and the urgent need for cooperation among the five ethnic groups. Fortunately, the authorities are handling it well!

### Kremenets Abandoned; Kyiv Defenses Threatened; Red Army Achieves Great Victory on Northwest Front; German Attacks on Leningrad Show Little Effect

Moscow, TASS, 15th: A communique released by the Soviet Information Bureau states that on the night of the 13th, our troops engaged the enemy along the entire front.

Moscow, TASS, 15th: A communique released by the Soviet Information Bureau states that, "On the 14th, our troops continued to engage the enemy fiercely along the entire front. After several days of fighting, our troops withdrew from Kremenets (in the Ukrainian region of the Dnieper River)."

London, Reuters, 15th: According to recent reports received here, while German forces fiercely attacking the strong defenses of Leningrad have shown little effect, the threat to the defenses around Kyiv appears to have increased slightly. Moscow reports that Soviet troops have retreated from Kremenets, a major industrial city located on the east bank of the Dnieper River, 160 miles downstream from Kyiv. Kyiv residents still have ample time to construct defensive fortifications and obstacles, and they are confident that the city will not fall.

Moscow, Reuters, 15th: A Reuters correspondent reports that the Soviet army's loss of Kremenets means that the Germans have crossed the Dnieper River in at least one location. Before withdrawing, the Soviet command must have made the enemy pay a heavy price. German forces have been trying to cross the Dnieper for more than three weeks, and every attempt has met with a major setback. Kremenets is an industrial center with flour mills, tobacco factories, and various small-scale factories. The Soviet forces had already destroyed them before retreating, so the Germans will gain nothing after occupying it. Soviet troops are now fighting fiercely to stop the German advance.

Moscow, TASS, 15th: The great battle at the entrance to Leningrad is raging fiercely. The German side has suffered unusually heavy losses. The Baltic Soviet Air Force has inflicted significant losses on the enemy. The front commander has expressed gratitude to the air force. Flying Generals Koshin and Barabanov single-handedly destroyed an enemy pontoon bridge, eighteen anti-aircraft guns, and an infantry battalion.

Moscow, TASS, 15th: The Red Army, led by Xue Kefu on the Northwest Front, has achieved a great victory. Under the cover of tanks, Xue Kefu's troops repeatedly broke into the enemy's rear. As a result, 10,000 German soldiers were annihilated, and 200 enemy tanks, hundreds of trucks, 500 motorcycles, and over 100 artillery pieces were destroyed by the Red Army.

Moscow, TASS, 15th: German planes repeatedly attempted to break into Leningrad but were repelled. More than 100 aircraft engaged in fierce battles over the city the other day, resulting in the destruction of 17 fascist planes, with the rest escaping.

Headquarters of the German Leader, Dentsu, 15th: This afternoon's German war report stated that the German army is making significant progress in encircling Leningrad and is currently capturing new military defense works. Soviet heavy tanks have been used to launch counterattacks, but they have all been defeated by the German army.

Berlin, Dentsu, 15th: Well-informed sources here revealed that yesterday, German armored vehicles attacking the Leningrad fortress broke through the Soviet defense lines. The Soviets attempted a large-scale counterattack, losing 12 tanks and suffering heavy casualties. The day before, German troops occupied a village, capturing many artillery pieces and countless enemy soldiers. German engineers reported clearing over 10,000 landmines in one day.

London, Reuters, 15th: According to Moscow dispatches, German destroyers risked sailing into the sea lane leading to Leningrad. It is reported that the Soviets have sunk two of them. Vasily Island at the mouth of the Gulf of Riga is still in Soviet hands. It is believed that Soviet aircraft bombarding German territory are using the island as a base.

Washington, United Press, 15th: Stockholm's Aftonbladet reported yesterday, according to Soviet wireless dispatches, that Soviet "living bombs," i.e., old aircraft carrying explosives piloted by humans, have destroyed 12 German ships in the waters off Kronstadt by crashing into them along with the pilot and plane. The newspaper said that this "bomb" of the Red Army cost them twelve old planes, several kilograms of explosives, and twelve aviators. But the results of this "bomb" from the point of view of the Soviets has been that it cost them several thousand lives, twelve ships, and a huge volume of needed materials.

### Fierce Fighting Outside Leningrad; Civilians Bravely Resist the Enemy

Moscow, Reuters, 15th: The suburbs of Leningrad are engulfed in artillery fire, day and night. The battlefield there is like hell, with both Soviet and German forces bombarding each other's concentrated troops. The ferocity of the fighting is unprecedented in history. Soviet civilian guards have been fighting alongside soldiers for three months. The Pravda reported last night on the incident of how civilian guards defending a certain area of the Leningrad front repelled German troops in a bayonet charge. It is reported that German troops had advanced to the T River and occupied several villages. The civilian guards were ordered to repel the German troops there. First, the Soviet artillery destroyed the German strongholds one by one. Then, the civilian guards attacked through enemy artillery and machine-gun fire, often forced to lie prone in the muddy ground filled with water, gradually advancing to the German front lines. Then, they bravely launched a bayonet charge, and the enemy forces, unable to withstand it, retreated in panic. Two villages were thus recovered. The civilian guards then forcibly crossed the river, disregarding the dense German artillery fire. Soviet artillery also returned fire. The civilian guards were ordered to attack Village P, completely clearing the enemy troops in the village, capturing a large number of weapons, and consolidating their gains, firmly defending them without retreating despite the Germans firing on them from three sides. The German artillery bombarded the village six times in 24 hours, and German planes also bombed the village heavily twice, dropping hundreds of bombs, but the civilian guards not only did not retreat but continued to attack, finally repelling the German troops near the village.

Moscow, TASS, 15th: The News newspaper published an article describing the heroic resistance of the city of Leningrad. An editorial in the newspaper stated briefly that the working masses of Leningrad, strictly observing discipline and working cautiously, have turned their city into a huge fortress. Leningrad has fought with all its might, knowing that fighting against a ferocious and hateful enemy requires all their strength, great courage, and sacrifice. They are prepared to endure sacrifices to defend their homeland. Fascists have been bombarding the city of Leningrad for three weeks. Hitler's troops are digging their own graves at the city gates. Enemy aircraft are being shot down by our pilots one after another, shattering on the ground. German and Finnish warships, cargo ships, and submarines are sinking to the bottom of the Gulf of Finland. Leningrad's heroic combat has dealt a heavy blow to the enemy. This is a struggle for survival, a struggle for the homeland, for freedom, life, and honor. All our people and progressive humanity must fight alongside Leningrad.

### Soviet Army, Navy, and Air Force Defend Odessa Port

Moscow, Reuters, 15th: The Red Fleet newspaper today published an article stating that renowned marines and sailors of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, together with the army, defended Odessa, killing 20,000 Romanian soldiers in early September, capturing several enemy tanks, artillery pieces, and hundreds of machine guns, and capturing thousands of enemy soldiers. 70,000 members of the Soviet youth movement and 12,000 soldiers rushed from the city of Odessa to the front lines to assist in the battle. One Soviet soldier, wielding a knife, charged into battle, stabbing 22 Romanian soldiers to death, and a machine gunner single-handedly wiped out 300 enemy soldiers. A regiment of Soviet marines dispersed a regiment of enemy soldiers, forcing them to retreat to the sea, with more than half of them killed. After three days of fierce fighting, they achieved great gains, but the fierce battle is still ongoing, but the enemy has gained nothing so far, and the city of Odessa is as solid as a fortress.

London, United Press, 15th: Authoritative sources stated that the Soviet retreat from Kremenets has put the Soviet troops in the Kyiv salient in a dangerous situation because the rear of the Soviet troops there is threatened by the Germans. It is also said that the significance of the retreat from Kremenets is that the Kyiv salient is now vulnerable to German attacks. The Germans have already advanced on Kharkiv from both Gomel and Konotop, and now that the Soviet army has retreated from Kremenets, the Germans have another route of attack.

Moscow, TASS, 15th: The Pravda published an article today, stating, "The war has become a protracted war of attrition. In this type of war, Hitler's Germany's manpower and material resources are rapidly dwindling. On the other hand, our army's strength has increased, and reserves continue to join the regular army. Stalin's call has resonated deeply among the people, and the national army and guerrillas are increasing daily, and the number of Red Army reserves has also increased dramatically. As for the enemy's rear, it is becoming increasingly unstable. The heavy losses suffered by the fascist army have made the German public even more pessimistic. The deeper the German army penetrates into Soviet territory, the more difficult its situation becomes. The Soviet rear is stable and united with the front, supplying the front with manpower and material resources, ensuring that fascism will be defeated as soon as possible. As long as there is a breath left, the Soviet people are determined to fight to the end."

### Fierce Soviet Counterattacks; Germany Now Threatened

London, Reuters, 15th: A Reuters military commentator stated that President Roosevelt's declaration and subsequent actions by the United States will have very important and favorable consequences for the British Atlantic campaign, greatly reducing the heavy responsibilities of the overstretched British Navy, and their political and strategic impact is far-reaching. America's actions will inspire the will of all countries opposed to the Nazis.

### New British Fighter Planes Arrive at the Soviet Front to Counter the Latest German Aircraft and Defend Three Western Soviet Cities

London, Reuters, 15th: According to London sources, the British Air Force squadron announced yesterday to be sent to the Soviet Union is an additional squadron to the aircraft that Britain has already shipped to the Soviet Union and are being flown by Soviet pilots. The details of the aircraft models are currently unknown. London sources say that news about aircraft models and other information must be disclosed by the Soviet military command. However, questions such as whether the British Air Force squadron sent to the Soviet Union is attached to the Soviet Air Force or is operating as an expeditionary squadron are expected to be answered in the short term. British pilots may already be fighting in the Soviet Union, but it seems that the Soviet Air Force currently needs more fighter planes to defend the three threatened western cities of Leningrad, Kyiv, and Odessa, as well as the Soviet capital, Moscow. The British Hurricane fighter is very suitable for this work, and British Blenheim bombers and other short-range bombers can provide close air support for General Timoshenko's forces carrying out extremely important counterattacks in the central region. Long-range bombers are even more valuable, as they can constantly fly into German territory from the east and west to bomb it this winter. The size of Soviet bombs and racks is different from that of British ones, so the use of British bombers depends on the amount of British supplies assembled in the Soviet Union. This difficulty has an impact on the overall problem, but it is not insurmountable. Opening up the Middle East transportation route through Iran to reach the Soviet Union to supplement the routes through the North Sea and Murmansk can greatly help to solve this problem.

London, United Press, 15th: Military observers here said yesterday that they believe Britain may have sent the latest fighter planes to the Soviet front. These planes may have recently been shipped from the United States to counter the latest German Messerschmitt Me-109F aircraft. Observers say that engineers from the Royal Air Force are constantly improving "Spitfire," "Hurricane," and other British fighter planes, and it is believed that the new Messerschmitt fighter-bombers will face their first real test against these types of British aircraft, possibly in the Leningrad and Smolensk war zones.

London, Reuters, 15th: The British Navy continues to successfully attack German supplies and sea traffic on the northern Soviet front. According to a British naval communique, at dawn on Friday, British naval aircraft launched from aircraft carriers attacked enemy ships and nearby military targets in the Bodo area off the Norwegian coast. An enemy supply ship carrying approximately 2,000 tons was sunk, and several other enemy ships were also damaged. An aluminum factory and a power station were also hit and caught fire. No British aircraft were lost.

### German, Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian Embassy Staff Given Deadline to Leave Iran Today; 800 Germans to Be Moved into Military Camps; Internal Reform Issues Under Discussion

Tehran, Reuters, 15th: The Iranian government has notified the British Embassy that the staff of the German, Italian, Hungarian, and Romanian embassies have been told to leave by Tuesday. Today, the second batch of Germans will be handed over to British and Soviet authorities for custody. On Saturday night, Iranian Radio broadcast a government decree instructing Germans in Iran to report to the police immediately. The Iranian authorities are currently working to move 800 Germans residing in the German embassy gardens into military camps. At the same time, cabinet members have appointed representatives who will, along with several members of parliament, visit the king at his summer palace in the mountains north of Tehran in the coming days to discuss domestic reforms. Discussions of new policies have long been strictly forbidden in Persia. It is believed that the reform issues were discussed at a closed-door meeting of parliament on Saturday. They will continue to be discussed at an open meeting today. The Iranian people are now demanding improvements in governance and economic conditions, as the cost of living has tripled in the past four years. Another issue of concern to the public and that has prompted questions in parliament is the matter of the royal jewels. There have been reports recently that these jewels have been shipped out of Tehran. It is of great significance that this delicate issue has been raised for public discussion. However, according to rumors today, the removed jewels have been returned to the Iranian capital. The acting finance minister answered the question of where the jewels were by saying that these jewels, which are part of the collateral for the nation's banknotes, have never left the Iranian capital. The rest were always stored in the Golestan Palace. Due to repairs to the buildings next to the palace, they were temporarily moved to a bank, but they have now been returned to their original location. At a meeting on Saturday, parliament elected twelve representatives to meet with the king and request that he implement new policies. It is reported that the most pressing demand of parliament at present is that members of parliament have greater authority over national affairs.

### Soviet Radio Station Ridicules Hitler

London, United Press, 15th: Moscow Radio broadcast to Hitler yesterday, ridiculing Hitler's attempt to conquer Moscow. It said that on September 14, 1812, Napoleon entered Moscow without tanks or mechanized units, but he still tried his best to achieve his goals. Two months ago, Hitler said that German troops could enter Moscow in a few days, but what about now? "Hitler? How can you hope to follow in Napoleon's footsteps? Do you know that the Kremlin of today is not the same as it was then?"

No country has more to gain from the Soviet Union's stance against Germany than China. There is no indication of discouragement among the Soviet government, military, or civilians. The fighting in Soviet territory remains intense, and there is still no decisive outcome. The German military command will not admit defeat until all its soldiers, artillery, tanks, and aircraft are exhausted. In this respect, they are great soldiers, but great soldiers always meet with insurmountable defeats, and the German army in Soviet territory currently shows no signs of avoiding such a defeat. Judging from various signs, Germany has indeed miscalculated its own strength and that of the enemy. The actual front lines of the German-Soviet war cannot be accurately determined, but the most noteworthy points are roughly as follows: The German troops around Leningrad, under the command of General Leeb, are currently attacking the city desperately, but they have been hindered by rain and met with fierce resistance from the Soviet defenders, and they do not seem to have made much progress or been able to encircle the city and cut off its communications. The Soviet troops, although under attack from two sides, are still launching counterattacks from the Valdai Hills, indirectly threatening the positions of Leeb's German troops there, and the Soviet troops to the south are also launching attacks to support them. The Soviet troops in the Velikiye Luki area are also fighting quite successfully. These Soviet troops are the right wing of General Timoshenko's forces, and they are currently supporting the left wing of General Voroshilov's Soviet troops. If these Soviet troops have sufficient strength, the German troops attacking Leningrad will be in a dangerous situation. It is not yet clear whether the attacks launched by Timoshenko's troops against Yelnya (south of Smolensk) have weakened, but judging from the current situation, these attacks seem to have weakened. Otherwise, the Germans would not be able to launch an offensive southwest of Gomel and occupy Chonikow. This German advance is over 50 miles, posing a serious threat to the north of Kyiv. The Germans also claim to have forcibly crossed the Dnieper River somewhere south of Kyiv, threatening Kyiv from the south. General Buteni's Soviet troops will definitely counterattack these two German advances to prevent them from converging east of Kyiv. However, Buteni not only prevented the German advance but also launched counterattacks across the lower reaches of the Dnieper River in four locations, which have been quite successful. If the counterattacks continue, they will threaten the rear of the German troops advancing on Kyiv. The final outcome will depend on the extent to which the attacks and counterattacks along the entire front are successful. In terms of ability and determination, the Soviet military command is clearly no less than the German side. At the same time, the Austrian army in the far north has been forced to attack Murmansk again in an attempt to cut off the Soviet supply lines from the sea to Leningrad and other places, but so far there is no evidence that the Austrian attacks have been successful, and it is unlikely to force the Soviets to withdraw a single soldier from Leningrad to reinforce the north.

### Finland's Minister of Commerce, Tanner, Admits to Being Forced to Fight

Reuters, London, 15th - Finnish Radio reports that Finnish Minister of Commerce Tanner announced in Helsinki yesterday that Finland does not wish to participate in the great powers' military experiments and is unwilling to continue the war needed for non-communist interests. Our alliance with Germany was accidental, but Finland has not initiated separate peace talks with the Soviet Union. Various rumors are pure fabrication. We cannot trust the current Soviet authorities, but one rumor that is indeed true is that the Finnish people desire peace. We were forced to fight. Our war aims are purely military in nature, but we desire a border, and now that it has been restored, we are beginning to address political issues. However, while the war is not over, we cannot let the enemy know our next move. The Finnish-Soviet border is quite long and not yet stable. Our final border can only be determined at a future peace conference. Therefore, there is currently no possibility of concluding peace with any party.

Reuters, Vichy, 15th - Vichy News Agency's dispatch from Helsinki states that Finnish Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim has transferred the majority of Finnish troops from the Karelian Isthmus (northwest of Leningrad) to other front lines. From this, it seems that the fighting in the isthmus has essentially ended. The Vichy News Agency also stated that the new objective of the Finnish army is to conquer Soviet Karelia, as Mannerheim has vowed to take this land. The majority of Finnish troops are advancing towards Petrozavodsk on the western shore of Lake Onega, while the remaining Finnish troops are containing the Soviet forces on the western bank of the Svir River (between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega). This area is approximately 150 miles northeast of Leningrad and 75 miles southeast of the old Soviet-Finnish border. The Finnish side claimed a week ago to have reached this area. According to sources in Helsinki, Finnish troops have cut the Leningrad-Murmansk railway on the Svir River, but Soviet forces to the north are still 30 miles from this railway. It is reported that after Finnish troops occupied several locations on the Svir River, they are now trying to establish a continuous defensive line along the river. In the Salla region of northern Finland, fighting has resumed over the city of Kandalaksha on the White Sea coast. Finnish reinforcements have arrived in the area. German forces in the far north have begun attacking northeast of Petsamo, aiming to drive Soviet forces out of Rybachy Peninsula, but they have been met with resistance from American ships and have not yet succeeded.

Reuters, London, 15th - Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that Vichy's report that Finnish Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim has withdrawn his troops from the Karelian Isthmus to the area north of Lake Ladoga, if true, shows that the Finnish side is not concerned about the ongoing German assault on Leningrad. From the perspective of people in London, Sweden is not concerned about Finland's prospects in this war. They only want to induce the Finns to share the burden of the German army as much as possible on the northern Soviet-German front. If the Vichy news is true, Mannerheim's move may also indicate his unwillingness to sacrifice Finnish lives to assist the German attack on Leningrad, but he seems to have turned his attention to land that is of direct interest to the Finns.

### Current European War Situation (80) Soviet Belief in Victory

This is a radio report from the New York Times correspondent in Moscow, translated as follows:

The first impression of wartime Soviet Union is that countless Soviet people have an unwavering belief that the elite of the German army will be annihilated and dealt a fatal blow, just as Napoleon's army was completely defeated a century ago. This unwavering mentality is the same from government authorities to workers and peasants on the street.

When US President Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins, visited Moscow a month ago, Stalin said during his first meeting with him that he firmly believed that the American belief in the Soviet Union's strength to defeat Hitler was definitely not wrong, and this belief has now been demonstrated by the cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union in terms of raw materials and military supplies. The wounded soldiers returning from the front line especially express this view vividly. They all invite reporters to accompany them to advance towards Berlin in a victorious formation.

The origin of this optimistic psychology is difficult to analyze. The official war reports all claim that Hitler's blitzkrieg has failed and the general offensive has been contained. Apart from this, there is no other clear evidence to support it. However, according to the reporter's observation, there must be other reasons besides the success on the front line. Even if the Red Army unfortunately encounters setbacks again in this long and arduous war, the Soviet people's confidence in final victory will never waver.

Russians believe that everything they have is unique in the world. This mentality can be expressed in subtle ways. For example, vendors selling fruit at the train station confidently shout, "Good, good, good! Buy my best, very best plums!" Ice cream vendors often boast about their "super ice cream." Soldiers talk about their tanks, saying "Better than anything the Germans have." The Soviet ambassador to a certain country recently returned from Europe and said, "Hitler will surely follow in Napoleon's footsteps. Our country is vast and its strength is inexhaustible. How can Hitler's army seize it with one hand?"

Those who arrive in the Soviet Union for the first time will feel a deep impression of the peaceful scene in the rear. Most places do not even have any blackout equipment. Railway traffic is delayed, but it still runs as usual. Food is plentiful. Industrial production continues uninterrupted. Although Moscow has been bombed many times, the daytime scene is as normal as usual, with only some camouflaged buildings, anti-aircraft balloons hanging in the sky, and a large number of soldiers catching the eye.

The current situation is like this, and this optimistic psychology is not likely to change in the future. Since the German army occupied Smolensk on July 16, there has been no significant progress. Although the front line is not yet firmly stabilized, the mobile front line seems to have been glued to the fixed war zone. Behind these front lines, the Soviet authorities are stepping up the training of new troops and have already engaged in local counterattacks.

Moscow says that if the Red Army can hold out until winter, the German army will be finished. Neutral observers also say that Hitler should not deal with a protracted war in the east. The longer it lasts, the harder it will be for him to succeed.

In short, the Soviet army stands firm, the government leaders are very confident, and the public is full of optimism. This situation is in stark contrast to the majority of neighboring countries that Germany has ravaged.

A Yugoslav once expressed such patriotism: He was a clerk at the Yugoslav embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãand his salary was paid in US dollars, but he often exchanged these US dollars for Yugoslav currency. Now the Yugoslav currency is almost worthless. Someone asked him why he was so silly, and he replied, "This is our country's currency, I should use it! Don't be stupid, we Serbians are Slavs, and we Slavs will not be defeated by anyone."

### Hua Long Cup Individual Table Tennis Competition - Competition Meeting to Open Today

The second Hua Long Cup team member individual table tennis championship. The participants include Chen Tianjue, Lin Wenhu, Shen Shilin, Shen Shiying, Zhang Shangning, Shen Songting, Wang Xingyuan, Wang Zanchen, Shao Yugang, Zhong Jingqi, Zhong Xianfang, Li Hongyuan, Hu Guangxuan and other twenty people. Last year's champion Hu Junmin was unable to participate due to going to Hong Kong. Qian Yuru, a good chopper player, has not recovered from his illness and has also given up. Therefore, the championship seat for this edition is most likely to be won by Shen Shilin and Chen Wenzhen, the runners-up from the previous edition. However, the strong players Shen Shiying, Wang Xingyuan, and Zhong Xianfang have recently become unusually skilled and are also ambitious for the championship. There will definitely be a fierce performance in the future. In order to discuss the opening date, the authorities have scheduled a committee meeting to be held at the Hua Jiang Hospital at 50 Baylor Road at 4:00 PM this afternoon. All participants are requested to attend and discuss the proceedings together. The list of committee members is recorded as follows: Hu Guangxuan, Chen Wenzhen, Wu Guanyi, Wan Shijun, Cai Xiu, Qian Jiuru, Miss Wang Zeren.

Academic Lecture

### How to Study Today's Chinese Geography (1)

‚Äî Tan Lian

Geography is a subject that is most closely related to human life. Students should work hard to study it. All citizens must have basic geographical knowledge, because everyone's food, clothing, shelter, and transportation come from the land. The relationship between people and land cannot be separated, so special attention must be paid to it. Currently, the curriculum in secondary schools in our country is very heavy, and geography is often not given much importance. The geographical knowledge that students gain in class is too brief and needs to be supplemented. The following points should be noted at all times. The Sino-Japanese war has spread from the northern and central parts of our country to the south. We can no longer talk about the entire national defense, but the places occupied by the enemy, either a point in a city or a line of transportation, are still mostly ours. Judging from the terrain of each place, plains are generally easy to attack, while mountains are easy to defend. The areas initially occupied by the Japanese army, with the exception of Shanxi Province, were mostly plains. The areas that have fallen, such as Henan Province, are limited to eastern Henan; Hubei Province is limited to southeastern Hubei; Jiangxi Province is limited to northern Jiangxi; Guangdong Province is limited to southern Guangdong. The mountainous areas of western Henan, western Hubei, southern Hunan, western and eastern Jiangxi, northern Guangdong, and eastern Zhejiang are all firmly defended. Although the enemy has repeatedly attacked, they have only wasted their strength. Our army is still defending the original positions. Once the preparations for the counterattack are completed, it will not be difficult to immediately recover the lost territory by launching simultaneous attacks in various provinces. Although the Japanese had investigated our country's terrain clearly in advance, they mistakenly believed that occupying Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Wuhan would solve everything. They did not fully estimate our country's geographical advantages, manpower, and material resources, which led to this big mistake and trapped them in a quagmire from which they cannot escape. Our troops, whether in the north, center, or south, are all firmly defending their lines and waiting for the counterattack. This is what should be studied in terms of national defense.

### Grain: The US and Japan's Tacit "Standstill"

But All Kinds of Exploitation Towards Food Consumers Are Profitable A Hundredfold

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice in the morning market was still able to maintain the original level, but the afternoon market showed a downward trend. Stimulated by rumors of a tacit "standstill" plan between Japan and the United States, both speculative buyers and hoarders were alarmed, trying to reduce prices and sell early. However, a portion of major players had firm intentions, supported by local buyers who took advantage of small declines to absorb. Due to the prevailing trend, the market price was eventually under pressure and fell. For example, the spot price of small varieties opened at 107.5 yuan at the bank warehouses in the morning, then hovered between 106 and 107 yuan. Subsequently, due to rumors of speculative buyers selling, the price in the noon session fell to as low as 105 yuan. In the afternoon, the rumors intensified, the selling pressure increased, and the market sentiment became even more fearful. The price of small varieties at bank warehouses immediately plummeted to a low of 103 yuan. Sellers stopped selling to avoid further losses, while speculative buyers also took advantage of small declines to absorb. The closing price returned to 104 yuan. All varieties of rice from Saigon and Siam followed the downward trend of small varieties, resulting in a decrease of 2-3 yuan compared to last weekend. The price of Yinghua broken rice was 91.5 to 91 yuan, the current price of small varieties was 132 yuan, and the settled price was 127 yuan. The price of road cargo was 132.5 yuan, which fell to 131.5 yuan in the afternoon. Buyers were still trying to suppress prices, which were generally 1-2 yuan lower than the previous day. The volume of transactions was 700-800 tons, and the volume of current rice was 15,000-16,000 bags.

The quality of foreign rice this year is far inferior to previous years, with the rice being damp and prone to insect infestation, resembling Du rice. All foreign rice is known for its dryness, which allows it to be stored for a long time. This was the reason why the Qing Dynasty wanted to store foreign rice. However, dry rice must lose weight, so making the rice damp and soft increases the weight, which is a unique form of exploitation during high rice prices. Furthermore, rice merchants originally set the standard weight of a rice bag at 100 kilograms, but they deliberately instructed to reduce the weight during ordering. This kind of rice is then sold to food consumers who buy rice by the original bag, as food consumers cannot weigh each bag. Therefore, original bags of rice are divided into large bags and small bags. The weight of large bags is accurate, and the price is settled according to the actual weight. Small bags are sold with no clear weight, and any deficiency is passed on to the food consumers, while the price is still calculated as if it were a large bag. The sampling weight is also heavier than before, and all losses are borne by the food consumers. Therefore, operating in the rice industry, whether as a rice merchant or a rice shop, is profitable a hundredfold.

The arrival of thick and thin japonica rice is very scarce, but the demand from local consumers is quite strong, resulting in a similar supply and demand situation. There has been no change in the market. The prices of both thick and thin japonica rice and new japonica rice are similar. The price of Nanhang early japonica rice continues to open at 150 yuan to 149 yuan, and the price of special grade is 151 yuan. The price of Wuxi special japonica rice is 152 yuan, and the price of Pudong new japonica rice is 152-3 yuan.

Glutinous Rice: Scattered shipments occurred yesterday. Because businesses were closed for one day mid-week, activity was more lively. However, buying pressure did not ease, so market prices remained at the original level. Special grade glutinous rice for Hong Kong continued to be sold at 127-8 yuan, ordinary grade at 124-121 yuan, and glutinous tea at 111-110 yuan.

### American Flour Arrives: 750,000 Bags

Market Situation is Weak

A large amount of foreign flour has arrived in Shanghai. The irregular vessel, SS James Rykes, managed by the American President Lines, arrived in Shanghai last Thursday from Seattle. It docked at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong. The vessel brought over a large shipment of 750,000 bags of flour from the United States, along with over 1,000 tons of broken wheat. It is currently being unloaded. The Taikoo Company's Yuezhou vessel went to Tianjin the day before yesterday, carrying 70,400 bags of foreign flour from this city. Today, the American Red Cross will ship 1,000 bags of broken wheat for disaster relief, to be loaded onto the Jiangsu vessel bound for Xiamen. (Zu)

After the foreign flour market opened this past Monday, the actual retail sales by local buyers did not seem deserted. Because local flour is scarce and Australian flour is not being supplied, the buying and selling of American Camp flour was quite lively. However, the actual sales were all small retail customers, and speculative buyers, seeing the unfavorable environmental situation from various perspectives, were mostly selling off according to the market. Although new buyers and speculative players wanted to take advantage of low prices to buy in, they mostly watched and waited. The market has already shown a soft outlook. The closing price at noon was already 0.2-0.3 yuan lower than on Saturday. Fortress American flour was only 32.1-32.2 yuan, Golden Dragon West Warehouse was from 30.06-30.08 yuan, East Warehouse was 31.1-31.2 yuan, Banana was 32 yuan, Five Swallow was 31.9 yuan, Airplane was 30 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors intensified, and market sentiment was extremely fearful. Various miscellaneous brands of flour were already lacking buyers. The Fortress price dropped below the 32 yuan mark, to as low as 31.9 yuan. Golden Dragon West Warehouse fell to as low as 30 yuan, which was 0.3-0.7 yuan lower than last weekend. Only the wheat that has been stored and is scarce is unwilling to sell cheaply with the market. Local factory flour was 46-47 yuan, and Japanese factory flour was 43-44 yuan, still able to maintain the original level. Therefore, local factory return flour was still sold for 34 yuan.

### Oil Market: Oil Prices Fall Again by 5-6 Yuan

Yesterday, there was no buying activity in the spot market for edible oil due to weak actual sales. In the futures market, prices fell repeatedly due to rumors, as short sellers and liquidators emerged again. As a result, both rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil fell by 5-6 yuan compared to last weekend. Over 5,000 dan of clear oil from the Dayou factory were sold for delivery in September, with an opening price of 169.5 yuan, a high of 170 yuan, a low of 164.25 yuan, and a closing price of 165 yuan. Additionally, 3,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua factory were sold, with an opening and high price of 171 yuan, a low of 165 yuan, and a closing price of 165.25 yuan. Yesterday, 56 bags of soybeans and 1,000 pieces of bean cake were shipped to Siam. Today, 1,000 pieces of bean cake will be shipped to Xiamen.

### Finance: External News Controls the Gold Market, Spot Prices Particularly Weak

Yesterday, the gold market was scorching red, with both spot and futures prices suddenly plummeting. Due to rumors of a tacit agreement between the US and Japan, various market participants became bearish. Gold houses and securities firms sold off heavily, resulting in supply exceeding demand even after absorption by foreign exchange dealers, cash houses, and securities firms. Consequently, prices fell from 6,875 yuan to 6,855 yuan at the close, a decrease of 14 yuan, with over 1,000 taels traded. After the cash price opened below 9,000 yuan, it also plummeted due to bearish foreign news, and the market became extremely soft. In the morning, Chi Da sold 10 taels each to Tianyuan, Xiangxingyong for 8,950 yuan, opening 60 yuan lower. Tianyuan aggressively bought in, immediately reversing the trend, buying 80 taels from Xianghe, 20 taels from Hesheng for 8,980 yuan, and 100 taels from Litai for 8,990 yuan. Xianghe's buying pushed the price above 9,000 yuan. Xiangxingyong bought 70 taels, Zhongxing 30 taels, Fengxiang bought 20 taels from Laoqingyun, and Chengji bought 10 taels from Xiangxingyong, all at 9,010 yuan. Yili sold 10 taels to Chengji, all at 9,000 yuan. Zhongxing sold 60 taels to Xianghe, 40 taels to Xinyuan, and Wanfeng sold 20 taels to Hesheng, all at 9,010 yuan. Hesheng and Yongcheng bought 50 taels each from Xiangxingyong, and 20 taels from Mingfeng. Yifeng sold 50 taels to Yongcheng for 9,020 yuan. Suddenly, Xianghe bought 20 taels from Zhongxing, pushing the price to 9,050 yuan, and bought 10 taels each from Hesheng, Fukang, and Yongcheng for 9,035 yuan. Chengji sold 20 taels to Xianghe for 9,020 yuan, then the price started to fall. Defu heavily sold 50 taels to Hesheng for 9,010 yuan, and sold 100 taels to Tianyuan, 40 taels to Xianghe for 8,990 yuan. In the afternoon, Hesheng initially sold 10 taels to Lianxing for 8,980 yuan. Tianyuan sold 20 taels to Xianghe for 8,930 yuan. Later, the price fell even faster. Hesheng sold another 30 taels to Lianxing for 8,920 yuan, then sold 20 taels to Xianghe for 8,910 yuan, another 10 taels for 8,850 yuan, and another 10 taels for 8,800 yuan. Chengda sold 20 taels to Tongkangyong, dropping to a low price of 8,750 yuan. Defu finally bought 50 taels from Xianghe, 20 taels from Hesheng, for 8,800 yuan. Chida also bought 10 taels from Xianghe at the same price. Defu bought 20 taels from Zhongxing for 8,810 yuan, and then sold 20 taels to Decheng for 8,880 yuan. Xianghe bought 20 taels each from Yifengyong and Xinfengyong for 8,850 yuan, and finally bought 10 taels from Hesheng for 8,840 yuan, a decrease of 170 yuan, with a high and low difference of 300 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was around 1,400 taels. After the close, the price rebounded to 8,870 yuan. The cash price at the cash house was 8,900 yuan, with the buying price 100 yuan lower than the selling price. The price of gold jewelry also fell to 900 yuan, and then rebounded to 910 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan.

The futures market fell only slightly.

The opening price for the October contract at 9:15 AM was 6,867 yuan per bar (10 taels), 2 yuan lower than the closing price last Saturday noon. Tianyuan sold, dropping the price to 6,863 yuan. Xinfengyong bought in, and Hesheng aggressively bought in, lifting the price by 12 yuan to 6,875 yuan. Shunyuan and Litai sold off. The closing price at noon was 6,872 yuan. The opening price at 2 PM was 4 yuan lower, at 6,868 yuan. Xinfengyong bought in at a limited price, lifting the price to 6,870 yuan. Defu then sold off, causing the price to plummet by 15 yuan. The closing price at 3 PM was 6,850 yuan, a decrease of 14 yuan, with a high and low difference of 20 yuan for the day.

The price of gold jewelry decreased by 10 yuan.

### Import and Export Merchants Still Forcefully Active in the Black Market for Foreign Exchange, But Fourteen Banks Still Refuse to Trade

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: the official rates of both the Central Bank and HSBC were flat. There were some applications for legitimate commercial imports at HSBC's small counter rate. Import and export merchants in the black market were still actively operating in secret. It is rumored, although not confirmed, that a certain foreign firm was able to settle US dollars for non-essential goods at only 4.6875 yuan, so it has already softened to 4.75 yuan, a decrease of 0.0625 yuan. The rate for British pounds remained at 2.84375 yuan. Chinese speculators are mostly waiting for developments and instructions from the Stabilization Fund to settle their positions. Fourteen banks, including British and American banks, are still refusing to engage in black market trading. The rumors from last weekend have been debunked.

Hong Kong, 15th (Tuesday) Telegram: The foreign exchange market opened unusually stable this morning. The rates of various currencies showed no fluctuations. There were transactions but no market for spot Japanese currency. Tianjin, 15th (Monday) Telegram: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. The Shanghai exchange rate alone decreased by 5 jiao, to a price of 89.5 yuan. There were no other changes.

### Black Market Foreign Exchange is Difficult to Obtain, Demand for US Dollars is Increasing

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: the spot price plummeted by around 200 yuan, so the prices of British and American gold pounds also decreased by 5 yuan. The prices of British checks remained stable, and the market price remained flat. Because the black market US dollar exchange rate is tight and difficult to obtain, merchants are buying US dollars in the winter to use as a substitute, so the market price has increased by 5 fen. The evening price rose to 11.5 yuan. Hong Kong checks are stable, and the market price remains flat. The prices of Japanese and Korean checks are both trending weaker. The former retreated to 2.33 yuan, and the latter fell to 1.9 yuan.

### Silver Reserve Committee Stipulates the Procedure for Canceling Returned Checks

The Shanghai Silver Industry Joint Reserve Committee has changed the check exchange system and implemented it yesterday. Because it was the first day of implementation and also a Monday, there were many checks. After the committee sorted them out, they sent them to the member banks after 5:30 PM. The committee has issued a circular to each bank to stipulate the procedure for canceling the collection stamp on returned checks: "The Committee has changed the provisions of Article 5 of the Measures for the Check Exchange System regarding the collection stamp on collected checks. Item 1 states that 'The aforementioned stamp shall be affixed only to the payment checks of member clearing banks and the payment checks of the Committee, and shall have the same effect as the endorsement for collection and the parallel lines.' It is hereby stipulated that when the original collecting bank returns a returned check to a customer after collection, in order to remove the restrictions of the aforementioned parallel lines, when canceling the original collection stamp, the collecting bank shall indicate the words 'canceled by [bank name]' next to the canceled stamp, and the bank's staff member with endorsement authority shall sign and seal in accordance with the bank's signature sample regulations in order to ensure completeness."

The committee also issued a circular to the banks stipulating that "The Committee has stipulated in Article 5 of the Measures for Changing the Exchange System that member clearing banks shall affix the collection stamp prescribed by the Committee to the front of checks from other member clearing banks. It is hereby stipulated that member clearing banks, when collecting the aforementioned checks, shall, in addition to cases where the payee on the face of the check is the collecting bank itself (i.e., checks with the collecting bank's name as the sole payee), use the collection stamp prescribed by the Committee to replace the endorsement. The rest shall still be endorsed separately by the collecting bank in accordance with the law and existing customs, and the collection stamp shall be affixed."

### Securities: Short Covering and Adding to Positions Coexist, Domestic Bonds Continue to Rise

In the grey market for government bonds, prices continued to rise due to rumors of a certain development in the market. Buying sentiment in the market was very strong, with short covering and adding to positions both present. Market sentiment was quite tense. However, the rumors were only that there might be an agreement between Japan and the US, and it has not yet been confirmed. This matter is significant and cannot be decided overnight. There may still be changes in the coming days. This morning, Tongkang, Xinfu, and Renfeng bought in, while Yitai, Tongshun, Runde, and Runli sold off. The noon close was 0.1-0.3 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Tongkang and Xinfu continued to buy in, and Dingkang and Lianyi also absorbed some. Market prices rose again by 0.1-0.3 yuan. Yitai, Tongshun, and Runde continued to sell off, and Delong also sold some. The market price rose without being aggressive. As a result, all prices rose again by 0.15-0.5 yuan, reaching new highs after the interest payment. The total volume of transactions was estimated to be 1.7-1.8 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Stock Transactions: 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded at a price of 14.5 yuan.

Also, the stock market at the Public Industry Exchange was extremely active at the beginning of the week, with opening prices slightly higher, and then gradually rising. Although selling pressure was strong, it could not resist the buying sentiment. Because the market is quite confident in various positive news, although the prices in the later market have slightly retreated, the underlying trend has not softened at all.

### Yarn and Cotton: Massive Liquidation, Yarn Market Collapses: The Power of American Attitude is Great

The yarn market continued to fall, and the decline accelerated. This was because an atmosphere of peace permeated the market, which made speculators unusually active. There were many sellers, and at the same time, spot yarn transactions were sluggish. As a result, the market became even weaker. The downturn became more severe in the afternoon, with rumors that a US-Japan agreement had been reached. For a time, selling pressure was strong. It was also said that a certain bull, seeing the unfavorable environment, began to liquidate a portion of their holdings, so the market could not hold up. However, general short sellers took the opportunity to cover their positions, slightly reversing the upward trend. However, after the big rise and big fall, it was slightly hit. It is currently feared that there will be a trend of vacillation and holding, and then a new situation will be discovered. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,746 yuan, and the low price was 1,735 yuan. The initial opening price in the afternoon was 1,738 yuan. Later, it was reported that the exchange price had plummeted by 20 yuan, falling straight to 1,705 yuan. However, after entering the market, it rebounded to 1,728 yuan. Finally, the exchange continued to fall, and the closing price was 1,722 yuan. The off-exchange price was 1,720 yuan. Yesterday, 170 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 425 bales were shipped to Tappa. Today, 15 bales will be shipped to Hong Kong and 10 bales will be shipped to Xiamen.

The morning opening price for Double Horse yarn showed a weakening market, with the initial price being 1,745 yuan, slightly rising to 1,746 yuan. Subsequently, due to the loosening of the trading floor, many sold their positions, falling to 1,735 yuan, and then returning to 1,742-3 yuan. When the exchange opened at 9:30 AM and fell, market sentiment was dampened. However, the bulls resisted strongly, vacillating between 1,738-9 yuan for a long time, before loosening to 1,735 yuan. However, the closing price was 1,738 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics showed a total of 8,030 bales traded. The amount purchased by each group is listed as follows:

Hong Kong: 30 bales, Same Trade: 8,000 bales

Total: 8,030 bales

The futures market for Golden Double Horse yarn reversed violently, plummeting sharply. The loosening trend during the day and the atmosphere of easing made the speculators unusually active. Under this attack, the general short sellers, although the weakening of the potential was well known, could not avoid causing small retail investors with weak strength to sell one after another. As a result, the market atmosphere softened and remained relatively stable. The initial opening in the morning showed a slight decline in American cotton, and the factory orders were initially unable to stand firm, showing a tired state. The futures yarn followed the decline, feeling lifeless. However, with the big players pulling up the near-term contracts, it did not cause a particularly drastic plunge, which shows that the foundation was not very shaken. In the afternoon, the continued weakening caused the pulling up by the bulls to slacken slightly, so it followed the factory orders and trended downward. The September contract fell to as low as 1,645 yuan, the October contract fell to 1,648 yuan, and the November contract fell to 1,658 yuan. By the time of closing, due to short-term profits, the demand on the trading floor slightly reversed, so the market price firmed up and each contract rebounded. As a result, the September contract was 1,652.5 yuan, with a closing price 12.5 yuan lower, the October contract was 1,659.5 yuan, a decrease of 15.5 yuan, and the November contract was 1,667 yuan, also a decrease of 15.5 yuan. The market prices are listed in the table below:

### The Cotton Market is Also Hit

The current cotton situation has become stagnant. Due to the enveloping atmosphere of peace and the sluggish yarn market, the prices of 32-count and 42-count yarn threads have fallen sharply. Therefore, the cotton market, which is interdependent with the yarn market, has also been drawn into the vortex. Market sentiment is weak, and the factories are mostly watching and waiting. Transactions are almost at a standstill.

Oomra: 100 bales, 32.0 yuan, Same Trade

Fire Machine Straw Bales: 180 bales, 293.5 yuan, Also

Indian cotton has also arrived at the port. The Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Mingsheng vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 3,565 bales of Indian transit cotton from Hong Kong. It docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.

### Piece Goods: Buyers Are Wary, Fabric Prices Fall Sharply

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market started flat and then fell, trending downwards. This was because East fabric prices fell sharply, making buyers wary. Therefore, fabric prices fell due to a lack of owners. As a result, the morning opening price for Fugui fine cloth was 55.65 yuan, and it fell to 55.1 yuan in the afternoon. Fugui fine twill fell by 0.5 yuan, and other grades also fell by around 0.5 yuan. Most bleached and dyed fabrics were stable, and some fell by about 0.5 yuan. About 300 pieces were traded on this street. Cantonese, Hong Kong, and Nanyang merchants traded about 500 pieces of coarse and fine cloths, twills, etc.

Eastern Fabric: Due to negative news about the situation, speculative retail investors dumped their holdings. Therefore, the decline on the exchange was particularly strong. The futures price of Longtou fine cloth fell continuously, reaching 1.35 yuan per piece. Spot prices were relatively firm. The closing price for the Longtou contract at the New Warehouse was 58.3 yuan, a decrease of 1 yuan compared to last week. The prices of mid-grade miscellaneous brands of coarse cloth fell by 0.5-0.75 yuan, and the prices of fine twills fell by 0.25-0.5 yuan. This was because the actual demand from dyeing factories remained good, and traders took advantage of the low prices to search for them. The evening closing price for the Four Gentlemen's broadcloth new contract was 2.2225 yuan per yard, and the old contract was 2.18 yuan, a decrease of 0.0375 yuan compared to Saturday.

Also, 732 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday, and 41 pieces will be shipped tomorrow. In addition, 85 pieces were shipped to Tappa yesterday, and 8 pieces will be shipped to Xiamen today.

### The Wool Market Still Has a Lot of Hoarded Goods

The woolen fabric market has shown signs of fatigue recently. This is due to the repeated peaks in fabric prices and the rising cost of living, which have weakened actual sales. Buyers had already purchased a considerable amount previously, and now about one-third of that is being released back into the market. Looking at the prices of various fabrics, they remain firm and popular, largely due to the support of hoarders both inside and outside the industry. Hoarding is still prevalent.

### Hardware: Black Iron Sheet Patterns Scarce

3x6 foot black iron sheets are scarce in the market recently, so those holding the goods are confident. It is heard that recently, due to seasonal factors, the demand from thermos bottle factories on Wood Street has gradually increased, with hundreds of loads being transacted daily. However, because there is no source of supply from overseas for the time being, and the stock in this city is also thin, and the patterns are incomplete, those searching for them are even more eager, and those holding the goods are even more determined, and the prices are higher. Upon investigation recently, the market atmosphere is uncertain, and the prices of other goods such as cigarettes and local products are all soft, but the price of hardware is still rising without falling because most of it belongs to raw materials and not consumer goods. Yesterday, 3x6 foot black iron sheets numbered 5, 6, and 7 were 340 yuan. In addition, number 14 American white iron was 650 yuan, number 26 was also sold for 650 yuan, number 28 patterned was 700 yuan per load, and number 8 to 16 white iron wire was 250 yuan per package.

Yesterday, it was heard that Yi Tai and Lao Jiao Zhengshi, who are formal colleagues, had a batch of Kailuan Small Coal Dust (about two or three tons per household) come out, at a very low price. Because of this, the Kailuan Small Coal Dust hoarders tried to sell. The market air turned sharply downward. Lao Dan's warehouse goods opened at 410 yuan, a drop of 30 yuan. If the professional dealers can continue to throw out their Kailuan Small Coal Dust, the coal market will turn from tight to loose, which is expected.

### Through the Careful Measures of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, the Shanghai Exchange Market is Lastingly Stable. Yesterday's Rumors of the Restoration of the Black Market are Absolutely False. The Supply of Legal Foreign Exchange is Proceeding Smoothly. Chinese and Foreign Banks Cooperate Fully to Uphold the Established Policies of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.

The results of the Hong Kong meeting of the Chinese Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee have been promulgated, specifying concrete measures for applying for foreign exchange for the import of essential goods. Fourteen Allied banks, including HSBC, and the four Chinese banks of Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture, as well as various Chinese merchant banks, are all fully cooperating and complying fully, and have resolved not to engage in the black market or speculation in foreign exchange, in order to maintain legitimate merchant trade. Therefore, the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai has disappeared invisibly, and all industries have expressed support for the measures of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Regarding the widespread rumors in the market that the black market for foreign exchange would be restored yesterday, the reporter of the New Voice News Agency learned that it is absolutely false. This is in fact a rumor created by speculators, attempting to undermine the plan of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. In the future, the Shanghai exchange market will definitely be able to maintain lasting stability. The black market no longer exists in theory. Now, various Allied banks and the Central Bank of China and other banks have begun to handle the business of applying to the Exchange Stabilization Fund for foreign exchange on behalf of customers.

Residual Black Market Foreign Exchange Can Be Eliminated Immediately

In the sixth provision of the September trial measures promulgated by the Exchange Stabilization Fund on the 9th of this month, it is stipulated that each bank is only permitted to settle foreign exchange according to the legal exchange rate, and may not directly or indirectly buy or sell foreign exchange according to other exchange rates. The eighth provision stipulates that when a merchant obtains foreign exchange from a specially approved or licensed bank, all export bills of exchange must be sold to these banks. If the merchant does not comply with this provision, the Exchange Stabilization Fund may not supply foreign exchange. The Exchange Stabilization Fund will also not supply foreign exchange when the merchant is engaged in intermediary business. The purpose of this strict provision is to thoroughly eliminate the Shanghai black market. The reporter of the Da Zhong News Agency has investigated the situation for a week. Although there are still banks that are not specially approved to operate foreign exchange that are still engaged in black market transactions, the French Eastern Exchange Bank is one of the most famous. It is heard that last Saturday (the 13th), the bank made a black market transaction. However, five foreign merchant banks, such as HSBC, Mercantile, Chartered, Citibank, Chase, and the four Chinese banks of China, Communications, and Agriculture, that are specially approved by the Exchange Stabilization Fund to supply foreign exchange at the new exchange rate, are cooperating earnestly with the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Therefore, it is expected that if the trial measures can be strictly implemented from beginning to end, then this kind of private transaction will not be able to sway the market, and the date for the actual elimination of the residual black market will not be far off.

Application Forms Divided into Three Types

Regarding the application for foreign exchange, starting yesterday, uniform five-part forms will be re-printed according to regulations, but the colors will be different for each bank. For example, the ones used by the Bank of China are white, yellow, and red, and the ones used by Mercantile are white, red, and green. (1) Those who apply for foreign exchange for goods that meet the provisions of the first or second item of the September trial measures and are approved for import in Lists A and B should fill out the first type. (2) Those who apply for goods that must be imported but are not listed in Lists A and B and the list of prohibited import goods, with each transaction limited to US$2,000 or ¬£500, should fill out the second type. (3) Those who apply for personal remittances, travel expenses, insurance, etc., limited to US$200 or ¬£50 per person or family per month, should fill out the third type.

Different Regulations for Individual Needs

The name of the application form has been revised to "Application to the Exchange Stabilization Fund for Foreign Exchange Needed". The third item has been revised to the amount of foreign exchange needed. The fourth item is the type of foreign exchange needed (including the name and address of the exporter). A footnote has been added to the fifth item: "Quantity must be specified when possible", which has been revised to the approximate date of shipment and arrival. Part of the tenth item has been deleted, and what remains is: "Our bank guarantees that all the items filled out above are completely accurate, and is willing to provide the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund with written documents that the Fund deems necessary to corroborate the items filled out above." The third type of application form, under the name "Application to the Exchange Stabilization Fund for Foreign Exchange Needed", indicates that it is "for personal and other needs", and the content is completely different from the first and second types. It is recorded as follows: 1. Name of the bank, 2. Name and address of the individual or business needing foreign exchange, 3. Amount of foreign exchange needed, 4. Date of use of foreign exchange, 5. Nature of need (must be explained in detail in multiple items). Attached is a statement from the applicant: "I (this business) hereby guarantee that all the items filled out above are completely accurate, as proof of the application made to the above bank by me (this business), and declare that I (this business) have not previously and will never in the future apply for foreign exchange elsewhere."

### Haining Public Donation Relief Association is Preparing for Winter Relief. Compatriots from Haining in Shanghai Have Generously Donated Large Sums.

Since the war, production in Haining has been depressed, and rice prices have soared. The number of common people without clothes or food is countless. The county originally had a Public Donation Relief Association, with the purpose of providing relief to the elderly, weak, orphans, and widows. For sixteen years, it has achieved outstanding results. Recently, local figures Zhou Zimei, Xue Hongru, Xu Bingzhang, Yan Shengzhai, Jiang Guisong, and others met and decided to move the association's original remaining funds to begin handling winter relief starting in October, distributing rice and grain to the poor in monthly installments. It is learned that compatriots from Haining in Shanghai, Xu Yongzuo, Zhu Xiaoqin, Le Huibin, Zhou Wusan, and others have already generously donated large sums. If compatriots continue to donate, they can remit directly to Haining, so that the hungry and suffering can have food to eat.

### White Russian Leader Ivanov Assassinated Yesterday Afternoon, Two Assassins and Two Accomplices, Both Former Chairmen Died in Shootings

The English-language North China Daily News reports that the head of the Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Committee, Ivanov, 57, was assassinated at about 1:30 PM today (the 15th) in front of the White Russian Emigrant Office at 118 Lane, Muir Road, Meicun Number 1.

Shot Twice

The assassins were two Chinese, waiting across the street. When Ivanov came out of the White Russian Emigrant Office and was about to enter his car, they opened fire. Ivanov was shot twice and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. He was rushed to the Hong En Hospital, but was already dead. The assassins fled immediately after the shooting. It is said that there were two other accomplices at the scene, but they did not participate in the shooting. Ivanov had practiced law in Shanghai for many years. After Mei Cile, the former chairman of the White Russian Emigrant Joint Association, was assassinated in front of his residence on Nanyang Road on August 2nd of last year, Ivanov was appointed chairman of the White Russian organizations on August 9th. This move caused fierce controversy.

Previous Experience

On August 6th of last year, when Ivanov was nominated as a candidate for chairman of the White Russian organizations, he received a phone call from an unknown person, threatening him with the same method used to deal with Mei Cile. Two months after taking office, on October 29th, he ordered all White Russians in Shanghai to pay income tax to the White Russian Emigrant Committee, claiming that this move had no political significance and that the funds would be used to assist White Russian educational and charitable organizations. However, some Russian-language newspapers in the city criticized this. Ivanov had previously served as a judge in the former Tsarist Russian Consulate and an assessor in the Mixed Court. He later practiced law and gained attention for defending Ivanovian in the case of Ivanovian defrauding the Mercantile Bank of a check for 170,000 yuan. He was assassinated today, leaving behind a wife and a son, who is 20 years old.

Now, Mr. Deng Xiaoke, in view of the seriousness of this issue, has initiated a movement to save children out of school, appealing to enthusiastic people from all walks of life to make generous donations. All donations can be delivered to the Chuan Kang and Chongqing banks on Jiujiang Road and Henan Road in this city, and the two banks will issue temporary receipts.

### Special Correspondent Banks, Method for Collection of Notes, The Bank Clearinghouse Preparatory Committee Has Been Implemented Since Yesterday, Hoping That All Banks Will Cooperate and Make Efforts

The Shanghai Banking Federation Preparatory Committee, referring to the normal exchange system of the London Clearing House, has changed all exchanged notes to a collection method for settlement and has been implemented since yesterday. The exchange numbers of the special correspondent banks have been compiled into account numbers according to the original order, but the account numbers of the banks entrusted by Guyuan to act as exchange agents, in addition to still using No. 50 as the general number, are divided into numbers such as one, two, three, and four. The committee has just begun to handle this matter, and the various procedures are still incomplete. It is hoped that all banks will cooperate and make efforts to make it convenient.

Notes of Various Banks Entrusted for Collection

Since yesterday, special correspondent banks have all submitted notes to the Bank Clearinghouse Preparatory Committee for collection in accordance with Article 4 of the revised regulations on the system of note exchange, which states: "The notes paid in by other special correspondent banks that are received by special correspondent banks every day have been sorted out separately and submitted to the committee for collection in batches at the prescribed time using deposit delivery slips." After the committee receives the notes, checks the number of sheets and calculates the amount correctly, it will issue a deposit receipt to the account of the receiving bank. On one side, the notes will be sorted out separately, and a notice of presentation of notes will be prepared, together with the original notes, and sent to each paying bank, and paid into the account of the paying bank.

Insufficient Deposits Must Be Made Up on the Same Day

If the balance of the account of a special correspondent bank is insufficient to pay the amount of notes payable by the bank on the same day, it shall be made up before 5:00 p.m. However, payment checks issued by special correspondent banks and collected by foreign merchant banks shall be limited to the previous day's account balance. If the amount of returned checks paid by the special correspondent banks is insufficient to pay the balance of the account of the bank in the committee, it shall be made up immediately. Each paying bank shall quickly check the seal of each note presented and make arrangements for payment. If there are notes that should be refused payment, they shall be quickly returned using a deposit slip within the prescribed time.

Normal Exchange, Clearing Notes

A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned yesterday from the Banking Federation Preparatory Committee that the committee had previously established a note exchange to facilitate the collection and settlement between banks, stipulating that each bank should send personnel to handle timed exchanges every day, and dividing the note clearing into three methods: "entrusted agency exchange", "entrusted collection". Now, because the number of various notes is increasing day by day, and the clearing procedures are difficult to achieve consistency, and the calculation time and the capacity of the venue are limited, and it is impossible to simplify it, it has been resolved to change to a normal exchange system and use the collection method for clearing. All the detailed measures have been sent to all special correspondent banks for compliance.

### Ticket Seller's Greed Led to Death of Passenger - Suspect Arrested, Still Trying to Evade Responsibility During Interrogation - Students Testify in Court, Verdict Pending Further Verification

The practice of ticket sellers in the city's various tram, trolleybus, and bus lines of pocketing fares is rampant. Although the company authorities are aware of this, they lack truly effective measures to stop it. Unexpectedly, a major incident occurred the day before yesterday (the 13th) on the British-owned 20th trolleybus line, where a ticket seller's greed led to a passenger being pushed and killed. The details are as follows:

Pushed Out of the Car

Xiang Dongchuan, from Wenzhou, worked at the Salt Bureau and lived at 23 Cihou Lane, Seymour Road. At 1:30 PM on the 13th, Xiang boarded the 20th trolleybus at the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Yuyuan Road. When the bus reached the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Tongfu Road, Xiang wanted to get off, but the ticket seller, Wang Wanxiang from Haimen, had not given him the ticket for the two dimes he paid, due to his greed. Xiang demanded the ticket, leading to an argument. Unexpectedly, the ticket seller became angry and, as the trolleybus was moving, forcefully pushed Xiang Dongchuan off the bus, causing him to fall on the road and hit his head, bleeding profusely.

Death from Injury

Hua police officer No. 1925 arrived and telegraphed the police station. Detective Lu Shouchang was dispatched to take the ticket seller, Wang Wanxiang, into custody. An ambulance was called to take Xiang to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. He died from his injuries at 4:50 PM. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. Yesterday morning, the witnesses and Wang Wanxiang were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the case and requested a postponement to keep Wang in custody.

Student Testimony

The witness, Jiang Jing (17 years old), testified that he was a student at St. John's Middle School. On the 13th, at around 1:00 PM, he boarded the 20th trolleybus at the entrance of Zhaofeng Garden and saw the deceased board the bus at the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Yuyuan Road. He witnessed the deceased pay two dimes for the fare, but the ticket seller did not give him a ticket. When the bus reached the intersection of Tongfu Road, the deceased wanted to get off and asked the ticket seller for the ticket. Instead, the ticket seller claimed that the deceased had not paid. This led to a dispute. In a fit of anger, the ticket seller rang the bell to start the bus, while the deceased rang the bell to stop the bus. The ticket seller then forcefully pushed the deceased off the bus.

Spitting Blood

At that time, the deceased was standing at the door, facing inward with his back to the outside. The door was not closed, causing him to fall backward and hit his head. The trolleybus only stopped after crossing the road. As he was sitting near the door, he saw and heard everything. He also got off the bus and saw the deceased spit out two mouthfuls of blood. He believed that the ticket seller's actions were not only against the law but also inhumane. He confronted the ticket seller, who responded with a smile. He was now motivated by righteous indignation to take leave from school to testify.

Suspect's Evasive Defense

He added that another student from a certain school was also standing at the door and fell down at the same time. Wang Wanxiang claimed that the deceased rang the bell twice because he had not paid the fare, causing him to fall when the bus started. He denied pushing him. Judge Shi verified the testimony and ordered Wang Wanxiang to remain in custody pending the autopsy. The hearing was adjourned to the morning of the 22nd, and witness Jiang Jing was ordered to bring the other student from the other school to court for further questioning.

### Internal Disputes Continue at Jing'an and Longhua Temples

Internal disputes at Jing'an Temple and Longhua Temple have attracted public attention. Regarding Longhua Temple, because the incense offering this spring was more prosperous than last year, the person in charge not only did not repair the temple buildings but also used the pretext of construction to demolish large structures and rebuild them smaller, causing opposition. The attacks from both sides have intensified in recent days. On the Jing'an Temple side, the temple supervisor Yang Xi strongly opposed the successor abbot De Wu, saying that he was not qualified to be the successor. Both sides hired lawyers and attacked each other. De Wu insisted that the temple was a family lineage system and could be passed down from master to disciple, disregarding the laws and regulations of the former government. Yang Xi claimed that the temple was a "ten directions" system and that the abbott should be selected by the elders of various mountains, Dharma protectors, and lay Buddhists. It is now reported that both sides may resort to litigation to resolve the matter.

### Overthrow the Stepmother's Face!

‚Äî Ou Li

Shanghai has a very common expression, which can also be called a curse word, called "stepmother's face." Seeing this word, one can't help but think of a cold, dangerous look, and a vicious heart.

However, not all stepmothers have a stepmother's face. There are also quite a few stepmothers who are kind to their stepchildren and have good intentions. However, their reputation and achievements are buried because they are covered by the faces of other stepmothers, which is indeed a pity.

The reason why some stepmothers have a terrible stepmother's face is not entirely accidental. In China, most old-fashioned marriages are created by parents' orders and matchmakers' words. It is obvious that this kind of arranged marriage, which can also be said to be a matter of luck, is not easy to have good results. Marital unhappiness can be said to be one of the reasons for the stepmother's face.

In the past, women had fewer opportunities for education, and women with higher horizons tended to be unwilling to be stepmothers. Therefore, stepmothers had a sense of inferiority on the one hand, and on the other hand, they had not received a good education, so they used a terrifying stepmother's face to compensate.

Human feelings are like a mirror. If you smile at the person in the mirror, the person in the mirror will smile back at you: if you glare at the person in the mirror, the person in the mirror will glare back at you. The psychology of ordinary people towards people is also like this. When the stepmother enters the family, the stepchildren often have a hostile prejudice against the stepmother in addition to grief. As for the stepmother, because the stepchildren have a bad attitude towards her, she will unconsciously put on a stepmother's face. Of course, there are also stepmothers who first have a jealous attitude towards their stepchildren, which causes the stepchildren's hatred. The result, of course, is still a stepmother's face. However, in any case, having a stepmother's face is never a blessing for the family, so we should eliminate the stepmother's face and overthrow the stepmother's face!

From an objective standpoint, to be honest, it is easy to be a stepchild, and it is also difficult to be a stepmother. There is only one way to eliminate the stepmother's face, and that is for everyone to abandon their prejudices and work together in harmony. The children regard the stepmother as their own mother, and the stepmother regards the stepchildren as her own. If we can do this, the stepmother's face will fall without being struck down.

### Misunderstanding

‚Äî Wei Gan

Misunderstanding is the root of all tragedies in life. If there were no misunderstandings between people, many struggles could be avoided, and we could live beautiful and peaceful days.

We often cause misunderstandings due to language barriers. The words you say are clearly well-intentioned, but others hear them as malicious. As a result, they take hostile actions against you, seeking revenge, or even immediately become aggressive and resort to violence.

Different habits are certainly a cause of misunderstanding. When a single Chinese man goes to Europe for a short stay and a foreign friend comes and gives him three pears, he may suspect that the foreign devil is mocking him for being single. In fact, although Chinese custom considers good things to come in pairs, foreigners consider odd numbers to be auspicious.

Misunderstandings caused by customs are rare among compatriots, but differences in local dialects often cause trouble. Shanghai people call washing "da," so when people from other places first come and hear someone shouting "da" for no reason, they may clench their fists and prepare to fight. However, misunderstandings in speech sometimes have advantages, at least they are much better than not understanding at all. There is a joke below to prove it. A Hunan man who went out for the first time came to Shanghai, strolled around the Bund and returned to the hotel, and asked the waiter to bring boiling water. The waiter couldn't understand what he wanted. Although they were both Chinese, he couldn't even understand such a common sentence. He was so angry that his eyes were blazing and he shouted, "Gai si, gai si!" The waiter outside heard and replied, "Lai zai, lai zai!" Sure enough, boiling water followed immediately.

The greatest benefit of misunderstanding is that it can bring about countless marriages. Men and women who like each other and get married are mostly due to misunderstanding. The woman misunderstands the man's false name as real learning, his ostentation as wealth, and his temporary courtesy as a gentle nature. So without careful investigation, she reaches out her hand and lets him put on that engagement ring. The man mistakes the woman's makeup for beauty, her shyness when they first meet as tenderness, and her humility as obedience. So without thinking, he proposes to her. After marriage, their true colors are gradually revealed, and each person's temper is also expressed at any time. Their personalities are incompatible, and there are inevitably frequent conflicts. Once the inside story is clear, it is no longer possible to love each other as they did when they were unmarried.

Readers may protest that this kind of misunderstanding has no benefits and only bad influences. But you must know that if there were no such misunderstandings between men and women, they might never have any hope of getting married. Everyone sees through the bottom line and the shortcomings are discovered, who is willing to grow old with them!

Furthermore, it is best if you are clearly faking it but are misunderstood as being genuine. Because your purpose is achieved and everything goes smoothly. However, I think that as long as fake courtesy can be faked to the end, it is no different from being genuine. If you are sincere, but are misunderstood as being fake, it doesn't matter, because in the end, the truth is always the truth, and it will eventually be appreciated and grateful for. Although the Duke of Zhou was once frightened by rumors, he is still a sage today.

Misunderstanding is originally an inherent characteristic of life. The relationship between people, to be honest, is just a chain of misunderstandings. If you want to live in human society, no one can avoid misunderstandings. An ancient saying says that people value self-knowledge. In other words, it is difficult for people to understand themselves; if they cannot understand themselves, how can they get others to understand them?

There is no one in the world who can truly understand others. What is commonly called understanding is actually misunderstanding. However, since there is no understanding, we can only use misunderstanding as understanding.

Twelve Unexpected Storms

Waiting, waiting, watching a spring has quickly come to an end! Mei Bao and Xiao Gouzi haven't had any news at all, and even Zhao Si hasn't replied, obviously the letter didn't reach them.

Now Qiu Haitang is really sick and can't get out of bed anymore. Although Zhang Laoliu has put in a lot of effort to take care of things in the field for him, there is no one to take care of him at home. Qiu Haitang is left alone, lying on the kang in poor health, moaning from morning to night! It is a rare comfort for Meng's daughter-in-law to sneak over to say a few words to him, or to cook some soup for him to drink.

In fact, in the following days, Meng's daughter-in-law, stung by her conscience, had very clearly admitted that Mei Bao had been hidden by Shang Laoer, and that her father-in-law was also an accomplice, but she didn't know the detailed address. In fact, even if she could tell him, it was too late, because Qiu Haitang couldn't even stand up, so how could he have the ability to go to Beiping?

The days passed quickly, and it was almost the end of April in a blink of an eye. The warm early summer monsoon blew, making everyone feel lazy like they had rickets. For a patient who had become debilitated due to mental illness, it naturally had a greater impact. Qiu Haitang was almost sleeping all day long, not eating, not drinking, and not talking, which made Zhang Laoliu so scared that he didn't dare to go to the field, and could only stay at home day and night to watch over him.

Even Qiu Haitang himself didn't expect to live any longer.

Artist Interview

### Green Gem's Newcomer, Lan Qing

‚Äî Wei Ren

Lan Qing is from Fujian and is 23 years old this year. She has a father who wanders around all year round and doesn't care about the family, and a very loving mother. Her two younger brothers are currently working in the mainland with the Boy Scout Service Corps. Her sister's daughter is raised by her. She received normal school education and worked as an elementary school teacher in Fujian. She has lived in Shanghai for seven years, so she speaks Shanghai dialect very well.

When she was seventeen, a newly opened film company in Shanghai posted an advertisement to recruit actors. Lan Qing was introduced by a friend and joined the company to film "Sunset" in Huxi. She signed a contract with a monthly salary of thirty yuan and food was provided. She took two months' salary and ate white rice for sixty days, but the film was still not shot, and it was finally disbanded, becoming a remnant in film history. At that time, Ma Loufen hosted the Miaoyin Song and Dance Troupe, broadcasting on Fuxing, Guanghua, and other radio stations. Lan Qing was hired as a pianist, and sometimes she also made guest appearances singing in the microphone, which was well praised by the audience.

After leaving "Miaoyin," she led her own Meiling Song and Dance Troupe, broadcasting on the radio and performing on stage. She intended to use this work as a lifelong subject for artistic training, so she naturally did not expect to become a star on the stage today. After disbanding "Meiling," she joined the Star Technical Song and Dance Troupe, and performed in Nanjing with Tang Jie, Zhang Zhiyun, Ma Loufen, etc., and then went to Siam and other places, passing through many docks. The plays they performed there included "Empty Valley Orchid" and "Mr. Wang's Empty Joy."

When the August 13th Incident broke out, Han Lan'gen, Mei Xi, and others formed the Film Salvation Association, and Lan Qing also resolutely joined, broadcasting patriotic songs on the radio and working hard for disaster relief.

Later, Wu Lizhu started the Yueming Troupe, and she was also pulled in. Then, she decided to go to Siam for the second time to perform. She passed through Phnom Penh, Ti'an, and other places, and worked with Jin Shan and Wang Ying's China Salvation Troupe to do a lot of meaningful work. The "Great Righteousness Reduces Relatives" that she performed once caused a sensation in Southeast Asia. Soon, Yueming separated imperceptibly. She had no choice but to return to Shanghai.

In February last year, she joined the China Travel Drama Troupe.

The name Lan Qing was given to her by Tang Huaiqiu, meaning "Qing comes from Lan," which has a very profound meaning. The plays she performed in "China Travel" included "New Mei Luo Xiang," "The True Story of Ah Q," "Li Xiangjun," and "The Sky Net." Now she is a newcomer to Green Gem. At first, she was a guest performer, but later, because her acting art was loved by the audience, the authorities formally signed a contract with her.

Her surname is Lai, and the name she uses on the radio is Lai Lin. She likes to play bitter dramas, but she is also quite successful in playing licentious roles. She can play a good piano. She is willing to work hard and concentrate on artistic research. She never has a trace of arrogance. When she sees people, she always smiles slightly, very polite and amiable. This promising and advancing artist is worthy of our sincere encouragement and recommendation.

### Activities of the Peony Opera Troupe

‚Äî Fen Yu

The China Peony Opera Troupe, after returning from the Philippines, hasn't had many activities. They spent the hot summer quietly in Shanghai. Now that it's autumn, they still plan to seek development in other places. Recently, Qi Houqing, the person in charge of the troupe, received a letter from Huang Chaozhuan, a prominent figure in the Filipino Chinese community, again inviting them to perform. However, Mr. Qi decided to postpone going abroad until next year because it hasn't been long since they left the Philippines. As for the core members of the Peony Opera Troupe, they are Xian Mudan (Immortal Peony), Yin Mudan (Silver Peony), Bai Mudan (White Peony), Xin Mudan (New Peony), Hong Mudan (Red Peony), and Yu Mudan (Jade Peony), six in total. The former Lv Mudan (Green Peony) and Jin Mudan (Golden Peony) are both married. Fen Mudan (Pink Peony) is now in the position of the boss's wife. The current leading role will be taken over by Xian Mudan. She practices and rehearses her voice every day and is very diligent. She is progressing very quickly and can be said to surpass Green and Golden Peony. Carlton won't be performing Huangpi Opera for a while, and Wang Xichun certainly won't join the troupe casually, so the Guolian (National Drama Association) authorities are renegotiating with her, hoping to cooperate permanently.

According to reliable sources, Wang Xichun will soon formally sign a basic contract with Guolian. Fortunately, her relationship with Te of Hezhong (United Company) remains, and Hezhong's current productions are cooperating with Guolian, so that is not a problem either.

### Wang Xichun Signs Basic Contract with Guolian

‚Äî Mu Feng

Wang Xichun, a performer who went from the banks of the Qinhuai River to Carlton, and at the same time can be said to have transformed from Huangpi Opera to a film star, has made a very deep impression on the general theater and film audiences in Shanghai in the past two or three years. Especially in the Nanyang Islands, she, Zhou Xuan, and Chen Yunshang are known as the three most popular movie stars.

Originally, Wang Xichun and Hezhong had a special relationship. About two-thirds of all the productions of Hezhong were starring Wang Xichun. Therefore, the Guolian authorities were very interested in attracting her to cooperate. They contacted her four or five months ago. At that time, in addition to specially inviting her to co-star with Liu Qiong in "Battlefield Lovers," they also hoped to sign a basic contract. However, she preferred her Huangpi Opera life, but this principle was difficult for Wang Xichun to accept because she maintained a close relationship with Carlton, so there was no result at that time.

Recently, Zhou Xinfang disbanded Yifeng Society.

Chapter 10: Secretly Escaping the Cage with a Charming Beauty

Yuan Yuan held up her hands and waved them to the left and right. The female orchestra simultaneously played a piece called "People and the Moon in Double Harmony." Yuan Yuan danced the Tuozhi dance gracefully to the music, truly "hands like swirling snow, body like whirling waves, soaring like a startled swan, graceful like a swimming dragon," moving up, down, left, and right in a dazzling display, captivating the eyes and enchanting the soul. San Gui could not help but clap his hands and praise, "Wonderful, wonderful! I must admit that Yuan Yuan is the ultimate!" After the dance, Tian Hongyu then ordered Yuan Yuan to serve wine. Yuan Yuan walked to San Gui's seat, delicately picking up the wine pot with her jade-like hands to pour wine for San Gui, saying with a smile, "General Wu, please drink a few more cups." San Gui, who was only giving Liu Zhen a casual glance, heard her clear voice like a nightingale singing in a valley, and hurriedly took the wine cup, saying, "I feel very happy tonight and really want to drink a few more cups. I have heard of your beautiful name for a long time, and seeing you today, I am indeed captivated." Then he said to Tian Hongyu, "Tonight, I am very happy thanks to the blessings of the Royal Father-in-law. May I ask Yuan Yuan to sit with me for a while?" Tian Hongyu had no choice but to nod his head in agreement. He then ordered the female musicians to leave and ordered Chen Yuanyuan to sit in the lower seat, accompanying and encouraging San Gui to drink. San Gui looked at the beautiful jade-like face and happily raised his glass repeatedly, drinking heartily. At this time, it happened that Concubine Tian sent someone to report an important matter. Tian Hongyu had to apologize to San Gui, abruptly left his seat, and went outside the pavilion to listen. Taking this opportunity, San Gui said to Yuan Yuan in a low voice, "I have long admired your name, but I regret that our fate was shallow, causing you to be taken by the Royal Father-in-law. You must be very happy here." Yuan Yuan, seeing that there was no one around except a young maid standing far away, also whispered, "Hong Fu Nu was not happy to live in the Duke of Yue's residence for long, let alone someone who is not as good as the Duke of Yue?" Wu Sangui heard this and knew what Yuanyuan meant. He nodded, about to say more, when Tian Hongyu returned to his seat, frowning, and said to San Gui, "The situation outside seems to be very bad! Just now, my little daughter sent someone from the palace to tell me that Jiang Rang, the chief commander of Datong, has already surrendered to the enemy. The momentum of the bandits is even greater and they are about to directly approach the capital. Therefore, the Emperor is very worried and has not eaten all day. My daughter gave me a letter, telling me to be well-prepared." (171)
