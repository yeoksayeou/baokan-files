### Substantial Strength of the US Navy; Sufficient to Cope with Incidents on Both Oceans; Japan Responds to Actions on the Philippines with Inevitable Defense; MacArthur in Charge of US-Philippine Joint Defense

United Press, Washington, 28th. Former US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Standley, stated in a broadcast yesterday, "The US fleet is prepared and has sufficient strength to cope with any incidents in the Pacific and to secure victory for England in the Atlantic." Admiral Standley's speech was in response to an invitation from the "American Committee to Defend America." This program was scheduled during "Atlantic Victory Week." Admiral Standley stated that the US fleet should protect the passage of ships in the Atlantic, ensuring a steady flow of war materials to England. He stated that this measure might cost the US some lives, but this loss would be far less than what the US would pay if the Nazis were to win. He said, "If England is defeated, Germany will first invade North and South America, launching economic and military aggression." He believes that the security of the Americas depends entirely on the security of the Atlantic. Therefore, if the American continent is to be secure, it must assist the Atlantic fleet. Aiding England is self-help, and it would be incredibly foolish for us to abandon it.

United Press, Washington, 28th. Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the press last night that if Japan takes action against the Philippines, the US will take defensive measures and will do so decisively. However, George anticipates that the US government, during the current crisis, will only impose economic sanctions on Japan. George, one of the most conservative advisors on the administration's foreign policy, stated that he does not believe Japan intends to occupy the Philippines for long. He also stated that if Japan adopts an aggressive approach and takes action against the Philippines, it will affect the defense of the Western Hemisphere. It seems that all US officials are now in favor of establishing a high-level US Army and Navy command in the Philippines to fully defend the islands.

United Press, Manila, 28th. US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Mr. Sayre, praised yesterday the appointment of General MacArthur as Commander of the US Army Forces in the Far East. Sayre stated, "Given his past experience in the military circles of the Philippines, MacArthur is truly the only ideal figure to implement joint defense between Washington and the Philippines." President Quezon's secretary, Mr. Vargas, issued a statement stating, "The President need not reiterate his desire to supply the manpower and material resources of the Philippines to the United States. The President only stated that this order was issued with the utmost sincerity, and that he personally expresses deep satisfaction with the appointment of General MacArthur as the new commander."

United Press, Washington, 28th. Philippine Commissioner to Washington, Mr. Elizalde, telegraphed the newly appointed Commander of the US Army Forces in the Far East, MacArthur, yesterday, expressing his willingness to undertake defense affairs of the Philippines in both military and civil capacities.

United Press, Hyde Park, 28th. President Roosevelt prepared yesterday for a Senate vote, the same as a vote of confidence in his strong economic strategy against Japan to prevent Japanese aggression in the Far East. This test vote will elect Lieutenant General MacArthur as Commander of the US Army Forces in the Far East. This case will be confirmed in the Senate today. If this case cannot pass in the Senate, and the President also opposes it, then this case can be requested for the President to review again, but this is practically impossible. Lieutenant General MacArthur was once a leader in the Army, so he is very suitable to be the head of the 200,000 new Philippine troops and security forces. President Roosevelt has not taken further pressure actions against Japan, apparently waiting for Tokyo's reaction to the US actions. If Japan increases pressure in the Far East, then he will take further action. The President stated that he will observe the development of the Far East issue with a calm eye, abandoning the previous appeasement policy. Japan's actions will determine the extent of his direct action to prevent Japan's expansion of pressure, all depending on Japan's movements.

United Press, Manila, 28th. The newly appointed Commander of the US Army Forces in the Far East, Lieutenant General MacArthur, held a long meeting with President Quezon today, discussing the incorporation of the Philippine Army into the US Army. MacArthur revealed that only a very small number of Philippine troops are currently on active duty. Therefore, President Quezon must mobilize part of the 150,000 Philippine reserve troops to join the US Army. The Philippine reserve troops originally only needed to undergo five and a half months of training, so they must undergo further training to meet US Army standards. However, due to the lack of sufficient garrison locations, it is expected that a huge number of Philippine reserve troops will not be mobilized immediately. Although MacArthur is still President Quezon's military advisor and remains a member of President Quezon's staff, he hinted that he will no longer be able to serve as Quezon's military advisor.

United Press, Manila, 28th. Finance Minister Roxas officially stated today that the Philippine government has purchased 150,000 bags of rice from Bombay to make up for the shortage of domestic military rations and to defend against difficulties after any emergency.

United Press, New York, 28th. The National Broadcasting Company here learned yesterday from a German radio broadcast from Switzerland that the US Pacific Fleet has already left Pearl Harbor and is sailing towards the Far East under secret orders. The radio station stated, "According to reliable sources, the United States has abandoned its goal of achieving its objectives in the Far East through economic measures, and the US fleet is preparing to impose a military blockade on Japan."

International News Service, Washington, 28th. Official opinion here is that the joint Anglo-American economic blockade of Japan, coupled with the Pacific joint defense policy, has delayed Japan's southward advance by at least another year. Observers predict that Japan's subsequent actions may not risk confronting the joint forces of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India, but will attack the rear of China or attempt to seize the coastal provinces of Siberia. However, it is not certain that both will occur simultaneously. Government officials believe that although Japan needs to import tin, rubber, oil, and cotton from abroad, it will not attack Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, or the Philippines.

### Widespread Rain Disaster in Various Parts of Japan; Rail Traffic Between Tokyo and Yokohama Interrupted

Havas, Tokyo, 27th. Due to the recent heavy rain in various parts of Japan, rail traffic between Tokyo and Yokohama has been interrupted. Several other smaller railway lines have also been suspended. The number of houses flooded in Tokyo has reached as many as 76,000. Landslides have occurred in the city, causing 15 apartments to collapse. There have been losses of life and property. Most of the national schools have been temporarily used as refugee shelters.

Philippine Circles Express Welcome for MacArthur's Appointment as Commander

United Press, Manila, 28th. People in the Philippines are currently welcoming the incorporation of the Philippine Army into the US Army. Former US Army Chief of Staff, now serving as military advisor to the Philippine government, MacArthur has been ordered to serve in the US Army and has been temporarily promoted to the rank of lieutenant general to serve as Commander of the US-Philippine forces in the Far East. MacArthur told United Press reporters, "I am very pleased to be able to serve the country at this time of emergency. The purpose of the US government establishing this command is to defend its interests in the Far East at all costs. To achieve this goal, US and Philippine soldiers can be expected to work hard." Regarding the future procedures for merging the headquarters of the US and Philippine armies into one, MacArthur declined to comment.

### Dutch East Indies Freezes Japanese Funds; Financial Agreement Between the Two Countries Also Abandoned; Canada and the United States Take Similar Actions

Reuters, Batavia, 28th. The Dutch East Indies has followed the lead of Britain and the United States in freezing the assets of Japanese people in the Dutch East Indies from today onwards. From now on, all monetary transactions and goods exchanges with Japan will be subject to special license control. However, it is stated that this is not intended to hinder the internal activities of Japanese businesses in the Dutch East Indies. The Minister of Economic Affairs told the People's Council that from today, the following measures will be temporarily implemented: (1) Suspension of foreign exchange between the Dutch East Indies and Japan; (2) Exports from the Dutch East Indies to Japan, Manchuria, and Vietnam will require special licenses; (3) Banks are prohibited from receiving or transferring funds into the accounts of Japanese residents without special permission from the Minister of Economic Affairs. At the same time, the Java Bank announced that it would suspend the listing of Japanese currency. All Japanese currency transactions will not be allowed today.

Reuters, Tokyo, 28th. The Ministry of Finance announced today that 30 American commercial firms in Japan will be subject to government control from today onwards as the first step in retaliating against the British and American freezing orders.

Reuters, Tokyo, 28th. The Ministry of Finance has revised the regulations on foreign transactions control, which came into effect this morning, stipulating that the liquidation of bills and receipts before July 26, or funds received by various banks, will not require a license.

Reuters, Tokyo, 28th. The Governor-General of Korea and the Japanese consular authorities in Shanghai and North China have announced control over all transactions between the people of the United States and Japan within their jurisdiction. This move is in accordance with the Tokyo's action of freezing American funds.

United Press, Washington, 28th. Government sources told the United Press yesterday that the United States is considering canceling the rights of Japanese businesses in Latin America to use funds in the name of Japan to purchase military supplies and other goods and transport them to the Axis powers.

Japanese Consul Hopes to Revise US Freezing Order

International News Service, New York, 28th. Japanese Consul General Morishita stated yesterday that he hopes the United States will revise the freezing order. When making his remarks, Morishita implied that this unfriendly move by the United States would provoke the same reaction from Tokyo. Tokyo has also issued a freezing order in retaliation. Morishita pointed out that it is necessary for the governments of Japan and the United States to maintain trade relations. Observers believe that Morishita's words were specifically aimed at raw silk transactions, fearing that the raw silk market may disappear due to the freezing order. Many foreigners who were originally scheduled to leave the United States were greatly affected after the Los Angeles branch of Nippon Yusen Kaisha cancelled passenger reservations. This was especially true for Germans, Italians, and Japanese. The company's postal ship, the Tatsuta Maru, is still lingering somewhere in the Pacific with 40 other Japanese ships, seemingly waiting for the State Department to clarify its attitude so as not to be detained upon entering the port. The ship carries 247 passengers, 100 of whom are Americans.

Chongqing Newspapers Praise Britain for Taking Effective Measures Against Japan

United Press, Chongqing, 28th. A spokesman for the Chinese government expressed his pleasure last night at the ability of the British government and the British Empire to take immediate and forceful steps to counter Japan's new aggression in Vietnam. The spokesman stated that Britain, following the United States, severed business relations with Japan and froze Japanese funds, which dealt a severe blow to Japan's unsound financial and economic structure. This action also demonstrates the increasing solidarity among democratic countries. The spokesman said, "China welcomes this enhancement to counter the aggressive fronts in the Pacific region or elsewhere." Chinese newspapers here yesterday and today have filled their front pages with foreign news about the freezing action and the world's reaction. Commentaries in the Chinese newspapers all recognize that the freezing is the first step in dealing with Japan and hope that a second and third step will be taken against Japan. The Ta Kung Pao stated, "President Roosevelt has awakened, he has realized the mistake of appeasing Japan and has adopted a brand new Far East policy. President Roosevelt's understanding adds light to the Pacific." The Ta Kung Pao also expressed hope for further action against Japan, urging the United States to completely ban trade with Japan and take military action. The newspaper said, "The era of appeasement has passed, and what follows will be an era of sanctions."

Japanese Government Has No Concrete Measures to Deal with the Freezing

Reuters, Tokyo, 28th. According to reliable sources, Japan will follow suit based on how the United States implements the freezing regulations. Therefore, no further action will be taken for the time being unless absolutely necessary. The Ministry of Finance issued a statement with the above view, stating that the control is implemented with flexibility, which is the same as the statement made by US Wells to journalists that the control of Japanese funds in the US has complete flexibility. As for the news of Britain freezing Japanese funds, it is still awaiting official confirmation. Currently, the Japanese government has apparently decided not to issue formal statements for the time being so as not to worsen the situation, as the current situation does not permit lighthearted and impassioned remarks at this time. When Finance Minister Ogura met with journalists, he advised the people not to be pessimistic because of the US freezing of Japanese funds, but to fully trust their own government. The Yokohama Silk Exchange will hold a special meeting today to consider the US action and discuss plans to cope with this situation.

French Media Comments That Japan's Difficulties Will Be Worsened by the Freezing

Havas, Lyon, 27th. In France, interest in the tense relations between Britain, the United States, and Japan is increasing. The semi-official "Le Temps" published an editorial today, reviewing the Far East situation after Britain and the United States sanctioned Japan, stating that the freezing of Japanese funds by Britain and the United States will inevitably cause great shock in Japanese public opinion. Since the British blockade of the European sea, Japanese goods have not been able to be transported to the European market in practice. In addition, since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Siberian railway transportation has been suspended, and European land transportation has been blocked, resulting in a sharp reduction in Japanese export trade, and the general economic situation has been severely affected. Now that Britain and the United States have taken this economic sanction step, Japan's situation will become even more difficult. However, economic problems are still of secondary importance. Japan's main goal is to gain a favorable position in terms of its army and navy. In short, judging from the development of the current situation, it is still too early to draw conclusions about the final outcome.

### Dutch East Indies Steps Up Wartime Preparations; Army Actively Increases Manpower; New Airfields Reach 50

United Press, Batavia, 28th. The Dutch East Indies is gradually changing its life and daily habits to suit the wartime situation. Since Germany invaded the Dutch homeland in Europe on May 10 last year, the Dutch government here has adopted new ways of life, changing from the old ways. The easy seizure of Dutch tea, rubber, and all imports and exports has subjected the Dutch colony to the full threat of war. Air raid defense groups have been successfully organized, and the army is now engaged in doubling or tripling its manpower in the shortest possible time. The Navy Department plans to build new docks and the latest submarines and flying boats, patrolling the 6,000-mile coastline. Power plants in northern Java are adding personnel and establishing new sections specializing in building storage caves in the mountains, as these caves can store ordnance. At the same time, the organization of coin exchange management agencies and the training of indigenous people to remain calm during air raids have also begun. Batavia has also built an air raid shelter capable of accommodating 20,000 people in a few months. The Propaganda Department, the Shipping Commission, and the Wartime Emergency Defense Team are working around the clock to protect the prosperous islands of the Dutch East Indies. More than 50 army airfields have been built deep in the jungle, making them difficult to find. Dutch East Indies air force personnel are training in the skies above their territory to identify the battlefield. Even if the enemy air force has skilled technology, it will be difficult to operate in this difficult terrain. The army is also stepping up the completion of its motorized units and paratrooper training. Javanese factories are now working hard to manufacture tanks and light troop carriers. If war breaks out, the food supply in the Dutch East Indies will not be a problem, as the Dutch East Indies has abundant rice, which can not only supply the military but also the people.

### Australian Prime Minister Comments on Japanese Invasion of Vietnam

Reuters, Canberra, 28th. Australian Prime Minister Menzies made a speech here today, saying that Japan does not need Vietnamese bases for self-defense. Today's seizure by force from Vichy is only to deal with us. Japan is now in a military position targeting Britain's major interests in the Far East. Any Australian can understand this by looking at a map. Australia has always regarded maintaining peace in the Pacific as its responsibility. However, the deployment of Australian troops to Malaya, the country's great defense preparations, munitions production, and the economic measures announced on Saturday and Sunday are all solid evidence of the current spirit of the Australian people. This is not the spirit of aggressors, but the spirit of those who spare no effort to defend their own territory. Australia has never had any intentions towards Japan, so controlling exports to Japan is entirely to prevent them from being indirectly transported to Germany or from establishing extraordinary military supplies. Japanese spokesmen often talk about encirclement, but this is completely inaccurate. It must be understood that the US policy has absolutely no conflict with Japan's legitimate and peaceful development.

### Chinese Government Requested Britain to Freeze Funds

Reuters, London, 28th. It has been officially confirmed in London tonight that the Chinese government has requested the British government to freeze Chinese assets in Britain and the British Empire. All measures will be implemented soon. The reason why the Chinese government made this request is that some parts of China are now under Japanese rule, and the assets in these territories have also fallen into the hands of the Japanese. If Chinese assets are not frozen, it will give the Japanese a loophole to continue trading with Britain. The Chinese government has also made the same request to the US government, and the US force has already taken the necessary steps.

### Japan Lodges Protest with Ecuador

Haitong News Agency, Lima, 28th. Peruvian newspapers yesterday published a serious protest lodged by the Japanese envoy to the Ecuadorian government. In the protest, the Japanese envoy categorically denied that the Ecuadorian official gazette claimed that Japanese troops participated in the recent border conflict with Peru. The Japanese envoy also stated that the sections of the Ecuadorian official gazette were a serious accusation against the Japanese government, and the Ecuadorian envoy should immediately urge the Ecuadorian government to issue a denial.

Editorial

### A Scene of Economic Warfare Unfolds in Europe

The way to build a nation fundamentally lies in the economy. Without it, it is impossible to promote political orders and to realize all constructions. Coming to modern times, human desires have expanded, living standards have risen, and the progress of various national constructions are all the driving forces for cumulative advancements, prompting the increasing need for the economy and the growing severity of economic competition. Thus, the need for the economy and the competition for the economy are mutually causal and mutually reinforcing, becoming the core issue of world politics and all international disputes.

Therefore, any country with sufficient and substantial economic conditions will inevitably be a strong nation. Conversely, it will inevitably be a weak nation. Moreover, a nation with a declining economy will inevitably be eliminated and destroyed over time. This is why the great powers constantly rely on economic policies to exhaust domestic ethnic minorities and deal with the peoples of their colonies, carrying out a form of invisible slaughter. Their measures toward defeated nations at home will naturally become even more severe. The viciousness of economic warfare can be seen from this. Although there are many who advocate for global harmony and equal enjoyment, the day of its realization is still far off, and economic warfare is in full swing. We have no choice but to face it head-on, with no possibility of avoiding it. (Please refer to this newspaper's editorial on the 22nd, "The Forefront of Striving for Economic Freedom.")

Since the various European countries were defeated by the Nazis, economic competition has followed. Although the economic restructuring of these countries cannot be compared to the situation in the victorious or negotiating countries, it is still a major evolution and the first scene to unfold in the European war. To get a full picture of economic warfare, it is essential to review the main points of this scene. These are described in detail below.

(1) Within the Nazi-controlled territory, a planned economy is implemented to increase production. This is a universally recognized Nazi skill that will surely be realized. However, the benefits of this increased production will not accrue to the people of the defeated countries but will be entirely the spoils of war for the Germans. Nazi officials openly admit that the living standards of the people of defeated countries must be suppressed so that they can be retained.

(2) Since Germany implemented inflation in 1933, it has reaped great benefits. Now, it is implementing this policy again in its occupied territories to stimulate production. However, the facts show that all the benefits obtained are enjoyed by the Germans. Moreover, the inflation adopted within Germany is strictly controlled and free from abuses, but the inflation in the defeated countries under Nazi supervision is already out of control, as gold has been almost entirely looted and replaced by the unlimited issuance of paper money.

(3) Although the exchange rate between various national currencies and the German mark is stable and the Nazi government has agreed to maintain it, based on past experiences, when it is beneficial to Germany, they will not hesitate to break their promises and devalue the currencies of various countries. The Dutch guilder and the Belgian franc are the most prominent examples. Manipulating exchange rates is the most effective means of economic aggression. If the value of the German mark is higher, importers can arbitrarily increase the import of goods needed in the occupied territories, while at the same time making it impossible for the people in the occupied territories to buy their goods and reducing exports. The reason why the currency values of countries such as Britain and the United States were much higher than those of economically backward countries in the past should not be difficult to find.

(4) How establishing an international trade clearing system centered on Berlin can benefit the defeated countries is incomprehensible. The trade between the defeated countries themselves, or with Germany, or with countries outside the German-controlled area, is entirely subject to the interests of Germany and is under complete control. Therefore, the trade clearing system is actually a disguised supervisory agency, with the sole purpose of exploiting the oppressed nations.

(5) Implementing an international labor allocation system in the Nazi-controlled area is quite appealing to those who advocate free trade. However, there is a clear distinction between the two. The former's allocation is entirely based on the interests of Germany, while the latter's allocation is based on the needs of each country. For example, military industries must be concentrated in Germany. If there are suitable laborers or raw materials in the defeated countries, they must be moved to Germany.

(6) Implementing international industrial trusts in the Nazi-occupied territories is to specifically allow the continued existence of certain enterprises, but they must be operated by Germany. Czechoslovakia and Poland have already implemented this method, and there is no doubt that other countries will follow suit. In other words, the large enterprises specifically allowed to exist in various countries are all for the convenience of Germany's domestic production and the enjoyment of Germans in its occupied territories.

(7) Trade agreements, barter agreements, and trust agreements for the Nazi-controlled Europe and other trade areas are all conducted by German plenipotentiaries on behalf of various countries. This puts the United States, Japan, and South American countries at a disadvantage, but the profits seized from this monopoly trade will all fall into the hands of the Germans.

(8) Improving agricultural production in the defeated countries is a win-win strategy. Germany can buy agricultural products from various countries to fill its granaries and use modern machinery to replace manual farming, while the remaining millions of unemployed farmers will become cheap, unskilled laborers for the Germans to use.

(9) Germany's guarantee of sales channels for agricultural products in the defeated countries and the long-term maintenance of stable prices for agricultural products may bring great comfort to farmers in Eastern Europe, but it is not known that this promise is entirely fictitious. When Romanian farmers sell their wheat, they may be able to obtain a certain fixed unit of lei, but they do not know that the Germans can devalue the lei at any time or raise the prices of industrial products to squeeze the Romanians, or even ban the sale of industrial products to the Romanians.

(10) There is no reason to dismantle established factories and stop industrialization in the Nazi-controlled agricultural countries. However, what the Germans are doing is not due to the fact that it does not suit local needs, but to transport the machinery to Germany. This can force each country to completely rely on Germany for the industrial products they need, and Germany can force each country to supply the agricultural products it needs.

In summary, the economic oppression imposed by the victorious countries on the defeated countries is truly meticulous and far-reaching. In a word, the lifeline of the defeated countries has been entirely occupied and plundered, leaving only the bare minimum of agriculture. This gradually degrades its people and restores their nomadic life. The intentions of the strong countries are self-evident. The importance of economic freedom can be imagined, and the powerful weapons of economic warfare are machinery and raw materials that can be produced, which should be clearly revealed. At a time when we are calling for those with money to contribute money and those with strength to contribute strength, will the people of our country wake up together and catch up quickly?

### Kong Xiangxi Broadcasts to His Sister, Reaffirming the Determination to Resist and Build, to End the War That Ends All Wars and to Thank the United States for Its Aid to China

Chongqing - Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi broadcast to the United States this morning, saying that China is determined to resist and build to the end, making this war a war to end all wars, and building a better world in the future. Kong said that our minds are filled with the belief that final victory will belong to us. The soldiers of our country under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek are courageous and determined. The men, women, and children of our country are also coping with hardships and are willing to sacrifice. All Chinese people are looking forward to the victory of the democratic countries in the future. We guarantee to cooperate towards this goal. The United States has long been a righteous fighter for world peace and democracy. We now know that the United States will cooperate with our country under this great factor of justice and humanity. Kong thanked the United States for its moral and material assistance to China. Kong also praised President Roosevelt, saying that President Roosevelt is engaged in guiding the world into a just, humane, and lasting peace. Both China and the United States recognize that there must be a better world in the future. This world is based on peace, human welfare, and high moral standards. In this world, there will be no thieves and wars, but only national cooperation. We should be determined to make this war a war to end all wars. (United Press, 28th)

### Xinhua Daily Warns Britain and the United States

Chongqing - The Communist Party's Xinhua Daily warned Britain and the United States that Japan would not take it calmly if they ended their appeasement policy. The newspaper predicted that Japan would attack British and American interests in the Far East and even prepare for armed conflict. (United Press, 28th)

### Tianjin Suspends Issuance of Import and Export Permits

Tianjin - Foreign trade in this city came to a standstill today. The Joint Reserve Bank completely suspended trade and refused to issue import and export permits. The bank has refused to sell foreign exchange necessary for exports, but it is heard that Chinese merchants and merchants from countries other than Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands are still permitted to transport goods to Shanghai. (United Press, 28th)

### Jiangxi Province Compiles Historical Facts of Resistance and Construction

Taihe - Since the outbreak of the war of resistance and construction, the heroic resistance of the military and civilians of Jiangxi Province has been a moving and unforgettable story. The Provincial Association for Resistance and Assistance intends to collect historical facts of resistance and construction from the military and civilians and compile them into a book to promote righteousness and inspire resistance and construction. The special commissioner's offices, county governments, district offices, and people in the Jiangbei war zone are enthusiastically submitting manuscripts. The association is actively organizing and printing them for distribution. (27th Dispatch)

### Chinese Side Denies Sending Troops to Aid the Soviet Union; Rumors of Establishing an Agreement with the Soviet Union Are Untrue; Outer Mongolia and the Chinese Communist Party Will Aid the Soviet Union

Chongqing - Chinese officials today denied foreign rumors that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has reached an agreement with the Soviet government to send a million Chinese troops to Siberia to help the Soviet Union resist a possible Japanese invasion. Qualified observers also do not believe this statement, because the best way for Chinese troops to help the Soviet Union is to contain the Japanese army in various parts of China when war breaks out. Siberia's cold climate is not suitable for Chinese troops, but Outer Mongolia and the Chinese Communist Party will aid the Soviet Union. They pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party has ordered its members to attack the Japanese army in various parts of China and to fight against Japan on the same front as the Soviet Union when Japan attacks Siberia. (United Press, 28th)

### British and American Ships Patrol the Atlantic to Defend the World's Lifeline; American Supplies Are Being Shipped to Britain in a Steady Stream; Assistance to China and the Soviet Union Is Being Intensified; Roosevelt's Representative Hopkins Broadcasts in London

Reuters, London, 28th - Roosevelt's personal representative, Hopkins, broadcast to the British people in London tonight, saying that tonight, British and American warships are patrolling the Atlantic Ocean with the sole purpose of defending the world's lifeline. I flew across the Atlantic on a bomber, accompanied by 20 bombers, and thousands of American planes have already flown across the Atlantic or have been loaded onto ships to be transported to Britain. My mission is also the mission of everyone in the United States, from the president to the shipyard workers, to defend our traditional freedom of thought and action. Hitler is now threatening our freedom. The President speaks for the United States, and what he gives to Britain is not just lip service. American destroyers are now sailing into the North Atlantic. We were once separated by the ocean, but now we are connected by this ocean. The US President and the UK share the determination to defeat the violence in Berlin. I am ordered to come here to investigate what Britain needs now and whether American supplies are being delivered safely. I feel that today's Atlantic is only a bridge of friendship, sympathy, and admiration, starting from Washington and ending in London. Although this bridge cannot be seen with the eyes, it is very strong and cannot be destroyed by the forces of darkness and the Nazis. We no longer measure distance in miles. The Huns are only 21 miles from Dover, but their people and their rebellious ways are 2,000 years away from Dover. I, like most Americans, feel that our way of life and nation are now threatened by Hitler, and I feel that our struggle is for the freedom of the whole world, so this struggle must not fail and will not fail. You have received messages of goodwill from the United States. The US President knows that this is not enough. The President feels that sympathy is human nature, but he also feels that the Flying Fortress can drop explosive bombs. The President knows that admiration makes people happy, but he also knows that destroyers can drop depth charges. The Lend-Lease Act transforms our admiration and sympathy into a clear form and shows those who want to enslave democratic countries the answer of its sharp weapons. What the United States has already given to Britain has not yet been told to you, because the publication of these figures would provide the enemy with valuable information and hinder the Atlantic lifeline. Now this lifeline is stronger than before. Ships loaded with more real things than hope and sympathy come here every day in an endless stream. This continuous line cannot now be stopped by any action of the enemy. In the past few months, the number of planes made in the United States that have flown across the Atlantic or have been transported to Britain has been in the thousands. The program to manufacture thousands of four-engine Boeing or bombers is progressing very rapidly. Hitler will not be able to move his factories to escape the destructive power of these bombers. The United States has transported many tanks to all parts of the British Empire, and many more are on the way. An unprecedented large-scale shipbuilding program is also underway. Factories do not stop day and night. We dare to say that there will be enough ships to transport food, gasoline, and ammunition. American tanks are now appearing in the Western Desert, and American-made planes are now soaring in the sky to attack enemy planes. British factories engaged in production are now using American-made machines. Although we have this contribution, it is only a part of your great war effort, because tears and toil are all from you, not from us. We have never been unaware of this. Our slow actions on the surface are not without reason. Factories with peacetime production equipment cannot be changed in an instant. It will inevitably take some time before we know that the war will be decided by the factories in Los Angeles, the steel in Pittsburgh, and the mines in Pennsylvania. Today, we understand it.

American Industry

Now, we have joined hands with the British workers under the guidance of the Duke of Beverbrook, and we know that the urgent task is to eliminate disputes, limit vacations, and sacrifice everything to seek common victory. The number of ships that the United States is now building, which were previously just drawings on paper, will soon appear at sea to replenish the supply line between Britain and the United States. We have also never neglected the food problem. The United States will never allow the British people to go hungry and perform their duties. The United States has decided to reduce the consumption of food and increase its production. In the next twelve months, a large amount of food will arrive here. Thousands of goods necessary for the war effort, from airplane oil to road-building machinery, chemical drugs, and metals, are now on the way and will become more and more. The Lend-Lease Act has given the President special powers to carry out this great program of production and delivery. We have also never forgotten to pay attention to the East, where China is bravely fighting against the violence that endangers democracy, nor have we forgotten the Soviet Union's war to defend its territory. We Americans are determined to provide all possible assistance to China and the Soviet Union and to do so immediately. Churchill asked us for tools. I can now tell you that these tools are arriving here one after another, continuously from the west coast of the United States to Britain and the Middle East. The full effectiveness of this supply line must not be interfered with in the slightest. A large number of war equipment currently on the way will surely arrive safely. The US President has promised to find a way to ensure the safety of the goods shipped to Britain. President Roosevelt never makes promises lightly, so you are not fighting alone.

### German Planes Attack Britain

Reuters, London, 28th - An air raid alarm was issued in London this morning, followed by the sound of artillery fire.

Havas, London, 28th - The Ministry of Aviation announced this morning that German planes attacked southeastern England and the London area last night. The scale of the attack was the largest since May 10th of this year. Many bombs fell on the city of London, but property damage was minimal and there were few deaths. At least one German plane was shot down. The German air raid was probably a retaliatory measure for the recent British air raid on Berlin.

Reuters, London, 28th - British air activity was limited by poor weather last night and was quite rare. A small team flew into Dunkirk to bomb the dockyards, and another team bombed an airfield in northern France. One British bomber is missing. Three enemy planes were destroyed in an air raid on Britain.

Reuters, London, 28th - An air battle took place in the skies over the Dover Strait yesterday afternoon. The British Ministry of Aviation stated that when British fighter planes were engaged in offensive patrols over the Strait, they clashed with a team of enemy fighter planes. One enemy plane was shot down and several were heavily damaged, but because the clouds were low, it was necessary to purchase the wreckage from the sea, so it could not be confirmed that it was destroyed. One British fighter plane was lost.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 28th - Officials announced last night that a German destroyer in the Strait was attacked by nine British planes and six torpedo boats yesterday afternoon. At that time, six German planes suddenly appeared, defeating the British planes and shooting down a Hurricane plane. The British torpedo boats were also forced to retreat before they approached to attack the German ship.

### Rumors of Large German and Bulgarian Forces Concentrating on the Turkish Border; Turkey Is Taking Necessary Measures; War Will Occur If Invaded

International News Agency, New York, 28th - Moscow Radio broadcast news from the Turkish capital that 23 to 25 divisions of German and Bulgarian troops are concentrated at the Bulgarian-Turkish border. Some analysts believe that German troops may temporarily stop attacking the Soviet Union and enter Iraq through Turkey, and then to the Caucasus. Analysts said that the German High Command is quite worried that it will temporarily hold its ground in the Soviet Union and enter Turkey from Bulgaria. If this move is successful, then Iraq and its rich oil fields will fall into the hands of the Germans, unless the British army in the Middle East, for the first time in the world, unexpectedly stops the Nazi blitzkrieg. If German troops invade Iraq, they can not only attack the Soviet Union from the south, but also make it difficult for the British army to defend the entire Middle East, and even attack the Suez Canal, shaking the position of the British army in the Mediterranean.

Tass, New York, 28th - Ankara reports that Bulgaria is rapidly implementing mobilization steps. Currently, 400,000 soldiers have been sent to the Turkish front.

Reuters, Ankara, 28th - Turkish people are not very concerned about Moscow's disclosure of the German plan to attack Turkey, saying that this plan must have been planned before the conclusion of the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship. Yichang has no criticism of this, but the general Turkish people believe that since Germany wants to choose between attacking Turkey and attacking the Soviet Union, it should be prepared to deal with it. At present, Germany is unusually humble to Turkey and uses various propaganda opportunities to leave the Turkish line with democratic countries, but it has not succeeded. The Turkish people know that Turkey's position is important on the road to the East, and although they admit that there may be a day when shocking events occur, they feel that now is not the time. At the same time, Turkey is taking all necessary measures to deal with aggression to prevent any eventuality. Mr. Sadat wrote in the Akshan newspaper that the foundation of Turkish-German friendship is respect for Turkish neutrality. Germany knows how much the Turkish people value their neutrality. If Germany has any purpose that is in conflict with Turkish neutrality, then war will occur.

### Swedish Prime Minister Delivers Speech Discussing Relations with the Netherlands

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 28th - Swedish Prime Minister Hansson delivered a speech yesterday discussing Sweden's relations with the Netherlands, saying that neutrality does not mean that the country does not actively protect its own interests. Therefore, Sweden's neutrality cannot be regarded as Sweden being indifferent to the problems of Northern Europe. Sweden knows that the Finnish people need living space and seek national revival. Finland has always expressed a sincere attitude towards the issue of Northern European cooperation. Therefore, Sweden's attitude towards Finland remains the same. The current problem in Sweden is to pay attention to its own people's food. It really has more than enough heart but not enough strength to help other countries. This is not because Sweden ignores the difficulties of neighboring countries, but because of the domestic environment. However, Sweden should do its best with the spirit of Northern European cooperation.

Tass, Stockholm, Sweden, 28th - Hitler's plan to organize an anti-Soviet "crusade" has failed, and he has to pressure Sweden to abandon its neutrality. German agencies in Sweden are using threats and deception to induce Sweden to abandon its neutrality.

### Afghanistan Reaffirms Neutrality Policy

Reuters, Peshawar, 28th - On Saturday night, the Afghan capital once again issued an official statement that Afghanistan adheres to neutrality in the current war.

Afghanistan strictly adheres to its policy of complete neutrality and maintains extremely harmonious relations with all belligerent countries.

### Paris Newspapers Encourage Germany to Send Troops to Occupy Dakar

International News Agency, Vichy, 28th - The Paris newspapers under German control were encouraging public sympathy yesterday to send German troops to Dakar to deal with the expected joint British and American action against Vichy's territories. Rochefort wrote in the Paris "New Era" newspaper, suggesting that Vichy should sign an agreement with Berlin to defend French North Africa's Dakar and prevent British and American aggression. Rochefort said, "If the Atlantic war develops to a certain stage, it is not difficult to predict that Dakar and its territories will be threatened." He also said that the Vichy government's high command in Africa will permanently resist this aggression, but manpower and equipment may not be enough to make an effective resistance. Therefore, a joint German and French defense of Dakar is a necessary plan. Since the US occupation of Iceland, it has been widely rumored in the United States that President Roosevelt also intends to occupy Dakar, but this news has been denied by the US State Department. However, French observers said that the occupation of Dakar is an important part of the British and American plan to defeat Germany. It is said that "although we cannot predict this, it will happen sooner or later."

### German and Italian Air and Naval Forces Attack Malta; Nineteen Ships Sunk

Reuters, London, 28th - Official Italian news agency has admitted that during the Saturday and Sunday attacks on Malta, two Italian torpedo boats were lost. However, it claims that the British official announcement last night, stating that all eight Italian torpedo boats and nine escort vessels involved in the attack had been completely sunk, is false.

Reuters, Cairo, 28th - Yesterday's Middle East British Air Force communiqué stated that the British shot down two Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 aircraft and shot them down five miles out at sea. On the evening of the 6th, British planes heavily bombed Benghazi harbor.

### Oxford University During Wartime

Oxford University, this magnificent institution, hailed as the city of human knowledge, has encountered the calamities of war twice in the past thirty years. However, the impact of this war is much milder than that of the last Great War.

During the war of 1914-1918, Oxford University nearly came to a standstill. Some faculty and students abandoned their pens for military service, while others left their lecture notes to serve on the front lines or in government. All research, publication, and lecturing activities within the university were put aside. Now, this ancient cultural fortress has been given special consideration by the authorities. Instead of being sidelined, it is seen as a source of national revival. The British government deeply understands that the lamp of learning must shine brightly forever, so it has encouraged the university to conduct scientific research and has provided subsidies, allowing half of the students and more than half of the faculty to continue teaching. The town of Oxford, where the university is located, which was full of tranquility and charm in peacetime, has now become bustling and filled with many bizarre scenes. The town is overcrowded. Refugees evacuated from various parts of London arrive in a continuous stream, estimated to be between 25,000 and 40,000. Houses and apartments are fully rented. The sidewalks of several narrow streets are teeming with people, leaving hardly any room to step. The city is constantly noisy. At dawn, the streets are filled with traffic, and the heavy footsteps of marching troops can be heard from time to time. The inns are overflowing, and the two theaters are thriving. The town hall has a wartime band playing music. Airplanes often roar overhead.

Only when the town is quiet at night does it retain some of its former tranquility. When the blackout begins, traffic stops. People hurry home. The last few people on the street rush into the buses. The white shutters of the shops slam shut. Then, all is silent, and Oxford University once again surveys everything with its lofty posture. On clear nights, the moon reveals its face behind the turrets and high walls of the colleges, creating a beautiful silhouette of the skyline of rooftops and spires. The solitary walker can appreciate the flavor of the Middle Ages.

Oxford University intends to maintain a sense of isolation from the town. Most Oxford professors show envy when they talk about the tranquility of Cambridge University. But the town of Oxford has unknowingly become an industrial area, which is unavoidable. Not far from the town, steel factories and motor manufacturing plants have been established, along with hundreds of small factories scattered nearby. Not only that, but in recent years, Oxford has in fact become an extension of London. With limited space and a large population, it appears very deformed. The rapid development of the city is beyond expectations. Therefore, on the one hand, it has some of the most beautiful streets and corners in Europe, and on the other hand, chaotic images are everywhere, leaving municipal experts at a loss. Since the middle of last year, refugees from London and coastal cities have flooded here, crowding this small place beyond capacity. With the city in such a noisy state, it is no wonder that the scholars of the university want to hold their noses and pass by.

Nevertheless, the bustling state of Oxford is not entirely meaningless. Precisely because of this, everyone feels the pulse of life accelerating. Wartime towns and wartime universities, regardless of the dosage, are infused with the vigorous energy that permeates the British Isles, has permeated Oxford. Many refugees have opened shops in the town. Several large London businesses also have branches in the town. Shops selling military uniforms and equipment are everywhere. Oxford's bookstores publish globally renowned books, with Blackwell's being the oldest and most famous. Now, they are thriving, with business hundreds of times better than usual. All books related to the war are sold out.

During wartime, there are many things that force the university to cooperate with the local community. University lecturers and factory workers drill side by side in the defense forces. Half of the defense force captains are university professors. The university and the municipal authorities also implement joint air defense. The Bodleian Library, built with American donations, was completed not long ago. Before it was opened to the public, it was occupied by more than a dozen public welfare organizations. One room near the entrance has been transformed into a blood transfusion center. Citizens and people from the university often participate in various meetings together to discuss all wartime issues.

At the beginning of the war, many people thought that everything would change drastically, but after the government declared that it would not conscript young people under the age of twenty, they immediately felt relieved. Six months after the start of the war, 70% to 80% of the students in the colleges had not been mobilized, and life continued as before. Last autumn, 746 new students enrolled, which is quite a considerable number. Last spring, although the government reduced the minimum age for conscription to nineteen, the government guaranteed that students who had reached the age of enlistment would be allowed to stay in school to participate in various important examinations. Many students studying science and medicine were specially exempted from military service. Oxford's colleges currently have a total of 2,000 students and graduate students, which is half the normal number. Those young people who enter at the age of eighteen can still study for a full year. In the future, the admission age will be reduced to seventeen, because middle school students will also graduate one year earlier. After the university is lowered by one year, students will be able to study for two full years before reaching the age of enlistment.

In these two years, the coursework is particularly heavy, and both teachers and students are pursuing it with extraordinary perseverance. The university has now established a wartime degree, which is awarded to students who have accumulated credits and participated in wartime work. Normally, Oxford students must complete three years of study (three terms per academic year, for a total of nine terms) to obtain a Bachelor of Arts degree. But at the beginning of the war, the university authorities, regarding the regulations as the most important examination qualification, awarded degrees to all students who passed five terms of examinations and served in the military for a certain period of time.

Many students, through hard work, were able to complete their studies in three terms. The school authorities felt that this was too fast and too shoddy, so they formulated regulations last winter stipulating that students must reside on campus for five terms, which is slightly less than two academic years, plus a corresponding period of wartime service, to obtain a degree. As for how society will evaluate this degree, it is still difficult to predict. But this degree, after all, represents a period of hard work, and the experience gained is also richer than usual, which is undeniable. (To be continued)

### Large-Scale Invasion Drill Held in Britain

Reuters, London, 28th

Starting at dawn yesterday, an invasion drill of Britain began around the city of London. The scale of the drill was unprecedented. During the drill, attacking aircraft soared through the city's skies, paratroopers descended, and the Fifth Column also attempted to control the rear. At the same time, troops transported by air, accompanied by armored vehicles, also landed nearby. The Home Guard, firefighters, and other civil defense forces were all mobilized. The Home Guard, familiar with the local terrain, hindered the progress of the "invading army," waiting for infantry equipped with heavy weapons to arrive. Smoke screens, gas tanks, and various modern tactics were all deployed. Yesterday, large-scale invasion drills were also held in London and Nottingham. Audiences in both places witnessed the intense street fighting between the "invading" tanks and the Home Guard.

### Soviet Military Representatives Arrive in Washington; US Promotes Aid to Soviet Union Movement

Havas, Washington, 28th - The Soviet military delegation arrived here yesterday. According to General Golikov, the head of the delegation, who spoke to the press, the delegation will stay in Washington for a long time to expedite the purchase of American armaments and ensure their rapid delivery to the Soviet Union.

TASS, New York, 28th - The American Committee for Promoting Solidarity with the Soviet Union and Britain stated that it continues to receive many resolutions requesting aid to the Soviet Union and Britain, including resolutions from the Rochester Italian Women's Association and the Pennsylvania Steelworkers' Council.

Coffee said, "The Soviet Union is the only country that has shown the ability to resist German Fascism, and we must provide it with effective assistance." Russian and Ukrainian groups in Newport convened a large meeting and passed a resolution urging the US government to immediately assist the Soviet Union and Britain in resisting Germany. Slovak, Greek, and Albanian groups in Philadelphia also passed similar resolutions.

### Italian Officials and Civilians in Asmara Prepare to Cooperate with the British; Economic Improvement Planned for Eritrea; British, Indian, and Australian Troops Launch Attacks from Tobruk

Reuters, Asmara, Eritrea, 28th - After this city was occupied by British forces, some Italians have now openly expressed their opposition to Fascism. Other Italians still doubt the possibility of the Italian army returning, so they are unwilling to express such sentiments. However, Italian officials and civilians are all preparing to cooperate with the British authorities. The general mood among Italians here is one of hatred for their leaders. Therefore, the problems currently faced by the British administration are mostly economic, with political problems being secondary. The economic development of Eritrea by the Italians continues as usual. There are many car repair and clothing factories in the area, and it is not difficult to find employment. The British have also allocated funds for recent subsidies for women and children. Currently, relations between Italians and British, South African, and Indian troops are quite good, which has helped to reduce the cost of living.

Reuters, London, 28th - Sources here have recently received reports that the remaining Italian forces in the Gondar region of Abyssinia, numbering 10,000 Italian and local troops, are now completely surrounded and cut off from all supplies. British forces will not directly attack but will force them to surrender automatically.

Reuters, Cairo, 28th - Military sources here claim that on Friday night, an Indian patrol set out from Tobruk and attacked a location north of the road leading west to Derna. British and Australian patrols attacked the southwestern part of the defense line. The results were satisfactory, capturing several enemies and obtaining valuable intelligence.

Haitong Press, German Führer's Headquarters, 28th - This afternoon's German military report stated that the fighting in Smolensk has come to a satisfactory conclusion. In Ukraine, German and allied forces continue to pursue retreating Soviet troops.

Reuters, Moscow, 28th - This morning, the Soviet side issued a communiqué stating that fighting continued yesterday in the areas of Velikiye Luki, Smolensk, and Zhytomyr. No reports of major battles were received from other areas. The Soviet Air Force cooperated with the Army, launching attacks on enemy units and enemy airfields. On Saturday and Sunday, the Soviet Air Force shot down 104 German aircraft, most of which were destroyed or burned at enemy airfields. The Soviet side lost twelve aircraft. According to detailed reports received, during the night of Saturday and Sunday, German aircraft attacked Moscow and eight aircraft were shot down (the previous report of six was inaccurate). On that day, the Soviet Air Force and the Soviet Baltic Fleet sank two enemy destroyers, one submarine, and two fuel tankers, and damaged one enemy coastal patrol ship.

Success of Soviet Encirclement Tactics: Details of the Annihilation of a German Infantry Division

Regarding the annihilation of a German infantry division, the details are as follows: Several divisions of fascist troops, newly arrived at the front line, launched an offensive against the Soviet army. The Soviet commander decided to encircle and completely eliminate them. After a day of fierce fighting, the German army was unable to resist the Soviet army's fierce attacks and was forced to adopt a defensive posture, digging trenches and holding on stubbornly. At that time, Soviet tank forces and mechanized infantry completed their encirclement of the enemy army, and Soviet bomber squadrons flew over the encircled German position in the early morning, dropping hundreds of heavy bombs. The enemy used artillery to bombard, with all flat-trajectory guns and other artillery pieces opening fire together, desperately trying to break the encirclement, but they encountered fierce artillery and machine-gun fire everywhere. Soviet flat-trajectory guns destroyed 20 German tanks and light armored vehicles. German aircraft launched several frontal attacks in an attempt to salvage the inevitable fate of the division, but they were all repelled and suffered heavy losses. The firepower and resistance of the encircled German division gradually weakened. As the battle was coming to an end on the second day, Soviet tank forces attacked, annihilating the remnants of the enemy artillery and machine-gun teams, and, with the help of valiant infantry, advanced rapidly towards the German infantry. Machine guns swept through the enemy like hemp. According to preliminary reports, 4,000 German officers and soldiers were killed on the battlefield, hundreds were wounded, and a large number of enemy soldiers were captured. The Soviet side destroyed dozens of enemy tanks, a large number of trucks and motor vehicles, and destroyed 40 flat-trajectory guns, 12 heavy artillery pieces, 8 light artillery pieces, and 20 grenade launchers. A small number of surviving enemy soldiers fled in panic.

No Changes on the Soviet-German Front; Both Sides Enter a Phase of Trench Warfare

Reuters, London, 28th - Responsible individuals in London received recent news from the Soviet front stating that, in reality, there have been no changes to the Soviet-German battle lines in the past week, because the Soviet army's resistance is particularly strong. There have been no changes to the positions from the Arctic to the Black Sea. The only noteworthy progress is the minor advance of German troops on the Finnish front. Moreover, this progress is so minimal that it can be considered to have no major military significance. Reports that two German divisions were annihilated are indeed a significant setback for the German side, but in terms of the number of troops involved, this cannot yet be regarded as a major defeat for the German army. Rozahev, deputy director of the Soviet Information Bureau, stated at a reception for journalists in Moscow yesterday, "Regarding the great battle of Smolensk, it is not yet possible to fully describe it, but when this battle is over, a detailed account will be announced. The battle there will provide material for years of study. The Soviet-German battle line is a continuously running great artery." He then mentioned the Moscow air raids, reiterating that only a small number of German aircraft penetrated into Moscow and that most of them were shot down, and said that the German side cannot long endure this kind of loss. Many German bombers shot down near Moscow were carrying a lot of gasoline, which shows that most of the German aircraft had to fly from distant bases to attack, because the new airfields near the front line are constantly bombed by Soviet aircraft, and many German aircraft in the fields are destroyed. He then described the land battles, saying that the enemy troops suffered heavy blows from the Soviet army, with many casualties and prisoners, and that the Soviet side would soon be able to provide a detailed account of the entire surrender of the Svalok mechanized army regiment. The German blitzkrieg had completely failed. He said that a few days after the German sudden attack, we said that the loss of some territory was insignificant, and some people thought this was an exaggeration, but in fact, there are dozens of Soviet industrial centers, so losing a small portion of territory is not a concern. When Reuters reporters asked him to describe the details of the Soviet air force's bombing of the Romanian Ploiești oil pipelines, he smiled and said, "Ploiești has nothing left but the name."

United Press, Moscow, 28th - The Soviet-German war, which has now reached its sixth week since it began, seems to have entered a new phase today, because the Red Army has fortified itself on all fronts, and the war that began with a blitz has moved beyond the state of quiet, and turned into trench warfare.

United Press, Berlin, 28th - Last night, official German news stated that two divisions of the Red Army, which resisted the German advance guard, were defeated by German troops at Mogilev, 80 miles southwest of Smolensk. The official German news agency stated that the Red Army on the Dnieper River was finally defeated after several days of hard fighting, and 23,000 Red Army soldiers were captured, along with a large amount of military supplies, including 80 flat-trajectory guns and 77 locomotives.

TASS, Moscow, 28th - On the night of the 26th, 100 German aircraft attempted to attack Moscow for the fifth time, but Soviet aircraft and anti-aircraft fire prevented them from reaching the Soviet capital. The enemy aircraft dropped bombs randomly outside the city, and only five to seven aircraft penetrated the city's airspace. Several houses and a school caught fire, and there were slight casualties among the civilians, but no military targets were damaged at all. According to preliminary statistics, six German aircraft were shot down, and our air force suffered no losses.

TASS, Moscow, 28th - German reserve troops have all been transferred to the Eastern Front, leaving only a few remnants to defend the occupied areas of France.

Haitong Press, Berlin, 28th - German troops continue to annihilate the Soviet troops surrounding Mogilev, capturing 12,000 more people yesterday. The number of prisoners has increased to 35,000.

German-Romanian allied forces also captured Soviet Captain Buyanov of the General Staff on the same day, who drove his car into the allied position by mistake.

### Soviet Foreign Ministry Denies Bombing Bulgarian Cities; Reports of Paratroopers Landing in Bulgaria Also Untrue

TASS, Moscow, 28th - On July 15, Bulgarian Minister to Moscow, Stanov, visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, representing the Bulgarian government to inform the Soviet side that on July 14, three Soviet paratroopers landed in the Dubil district. At the same time, the Bulgarian Secretary-General of Foreign Affairs also notified the Soviet Minister to Bulgaria of this matter. On July 27, the Soviet Foreign Ministry replied to the Bulgarian Minister, saying that after a thorough investigation, the so-called landing of Soviet paratroopers in Bulgaria was absolutely untrue. The Soviet Foreign Ministry continued that when the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry informed the Soviet Minister to Turkey of this matter, the Soviet Minister immediately requested to meet with these three Soviet paratroopers, but after two weeks, this request had not yet received a satisfactory response. Oddly, the Bulgarian side was unable to provide the Soviet Minister with the names of the three paratroopers. All of this shows that the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry had absolutely no reason to indicate that Soviet paratroopers had landed in Bulgaria. Reliable information obtained by the Soviet government proves that those who landed in Bulgaria were actually personnel sent by the German side from Romania. From this perspective, the so-called news of Soviet paratroopers landing in Bulgaria is purely fabricated by the German side, and its provocative nature is clearly evident. Also, on the 26th, the Bulgarian Secretary-General of Foreign Affairs notified the Soviet Minister that Soviet aircraft had dropped bombs in Roschisk and other places from July 23 to 24, and pointed out that the Bulgarian government was very dissatisfied with such incidents. Regarding this point, the Soviet Foreign Ministry also notified the Bulgarian Minister, stating that this report was absolutely untrue. Soviet aircraft had never flown in Bulgaria nor carried out bombings. This rumor was manufactured by German fascists and contained provocative effects, but the fact that the Bulgarian government gave importance to such an obvious rumor also surprised the Soviet government.

### Spanish Air Squadron Arrives in Berlin; Sweden Compiles Volunteer Soldiers

It is feared that Japanese troop transport ships will not be allowed to reach Cam Ranh Bay. The commander of the Japanese garrison in Vietnam is reportedly General Sumita. The increase in Japanese troops in Manchuria indicates that the Japanese military intends to attack Siberia when they deem it safe and feasible. Military circles here express that it would not be surprising if Japanese troops in Manchuria increase further in the future. (28th International Electric)

### Japanese Privy Council Special Meeting Approves Japan-Vietnam Joint Defense Agreement; Japanese Government Instructs Ambassador to France to Notify Vichy of Approved Agreement

Reuters, Tokyo, 28th: The Privy Council Special Meeting was held in the presence of the Emperor this afternoon from 4:30 PM to 5:00 PM, formally approving the Japan-Vietnam Joint Defense Agreement. All Privy Council members attended, led by President Hara Yoshimichi and Vice President Suzuki Kantaro. Government representatives in attendance included Konoe and the entire cabinet, including Bureau of Legislation Director Murase Naoyasu. Before the special meeting, the Privy Council Investigative Committee inquired about the content of the new agreement from government leaders, and detailed discussions were conducted from all sides, lasting a considerable time, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM. The Investigative Committee not only approved of the agreement, but also encouraged the government to prepare to cope with any situation that the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere may bring about. The Japanese government has instructed Ambassador to France Kato Gai Matsu to notify the Vichy government of Japan's formal approval of the agreement. It is reported that the usual exchange of letters between France and Japan will not be held. Once both sides have notified each other of approval, it will immediately take effect.

United Press, Saigon, 28th: Although authorities believe that the Japanese occupation of southern Vietnam will not lead to unexpected events, they dare not risk negligence today. French officials deny rumors that incidents have already occurred between Japanese troops and French civilians, stating that the rumors are absolutely unfounded. The reports from London that Japanese bombers have arrived in Saigon are incorrect. As of this morning, the only aircraft that have arrived here are Japanese transport planes used to transport members of the Japanese military delegation between Saigon and Hanoi. French authorities also deny reports from Tokyo that the Chinese Consul General and his staff have departed to return to China. The Chinese Consul told the United Press that as long as the French continue to guarantee his and his staff's complete safety, he will remain here. It is understood that the Vietnamese government has handed over a large portion of the equipment at the Saigon port to Japanese management. The French Chamber of Commerce, one of the best buildings in Saigon, has been taken over by the Japanese to house their staff. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce building has also been taken over by the Japanese and will serve as their headquarters. Japanese troops will temporarily be stationed in several military camps near Saigon. According to the French-Japanese agreement, Japanese troops will not interfere with French military facilities, including coastal artillery batteries.

### France and Japan Continue Negotiations Regarding Vietnam

TASS, Moscow, 28th: Red Star newspaper reports that "Although German radio boasts daily, Hitler is indeed blaming his generals for the unfavorable Eastern Front situation. General von Bock has been dismissed for 'insufficient combat effectiveness,' and General Keitel has also been dismissed. Hitler's actions are merely an attempt to shirk responsibility for his own poor command and have his subordinates take the blame instead."

### Finnish Newspaper Reports Soviet Union Orders Arrest of Batch of Officers

### Finance: Said to be Frozen, Yet Not Really Frozen; U.S. Dollar Exchange Still Short by Four Million Yuan; Many Buying in, Many Selling Out; U.S. Dollar Once Tight at the Five Yuan Mark

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions shifted due to the lack of concrete measures regarding how to handle the frozen funds and how merchants could make requests. This led to public anxiety and rampant speculation. Simply entrusting fourteen banks to handle matters is not enough, as it merely opens another backdoor for the banks. Despite claims of a freeze, black market activity in Shanghai continues as before. Hence, some say this so-called freeze is merely a thin layer of ice on the surface, with fish and shrimp thriving beneath it, which is laughable. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) posted rates at 9:30 AM, with both British and U.S. exchange rates down by 0.0625. British gold was 3 shillings and 1.25 pence, U.S. dollars were 5.125 yuan. There were no rates for Japanese, German, or French currencies, and other currencies also declined. The informal market for British and U.S. exchange rates initially saw little trading amidst the confusion. Chinese speculators were actively buying, and by 10 AM, the U.S. dollar at the HSBC small counter remained unchanged at 5.125 yuan. British banks, HSBC and Mercantile Bank, offered sales, but buying pressure continued to increase. It was reported that importers were buying in, causing a sudden tightening to the five yuan mark. British gold was at 3 shillings and 0.0625 pence. At noon, British banks and others offered some supply, so the U.S. dollar slightly hardened. In the afternoon, there were rumors of a Hong Kong blockade, and some speculators who had taken long positions began to sell. There were also rumors of Japanese banks selling. The U.S. dollar strengthened to 5.1875 yuan, and British gold also saw some hardening. However, by the close of trading, both exchange rates remained tight, with the British exchange rate softening. Trading volume was quite large throughout the day. It is reported that Chinese speculators are still short by around four million U.S. dollars.

Those Buying In Are Numerous

Since the morning, there have been no rates for British, U.S., or Indian silver via foreign telegraphic transfers. Exchange rates were down by half a cent for U.S. dollars against British currency, and down by 1.17 yuan for U.S. dollars against Shanghai currency, at 4.3 yuan (or 5.3 yuan, a mistake). The official Central Bank rates were flat for all currencies. The internal market opened early with bank selling prices (according to Reuters telegraphic transfers): British exchange at 3 shillings and 1.140625 pence, U.S. dollars at 5.1875 yuan. After the opening, market conditions were chaotic. Chinese merchants covered their short positions, and banks remained cautious. It was rumored that HSBC was willing to sell short positions to its clients at 5.1875 yuan. At 9:30 AM, the bank posted its usual rates. Except for Japanese, German, and French currencies, all other British, U.S., and other rates consistently declined. The silver equalization tax was slightly higher at 24.25%. At 10 AM, it was reported that the U.S. dollar at the HSBC small counter opened at 5.125 yuan, and people's confidence was slightly restored. Transactions were finally settled and opened. Chinese merchants continued to buy HSBC and Mercantile Bank July-August futures at 5.125 yuan. After 10:30 AM, buying pressure intensified sharply, gradually softening the rate to only settling at 5 yuan. British banks and other foreign banks were all willing to sell, so the noon closing was British gold at 3 shillings and 0.0625 pence, U.S. dollars at 5.0625 yuan.

Speculators Are Selling Long Positions

Market conditions remained chaotic in the afternoon. It was reported that speculators were also selling long positions at 5.125 and 5.15625 yuan. There were also unconfirmed rumors that the Japanese Bank of Yokohama Specie Bank had sold U.S. dollars for this month at a favorable rate of 5.1875 yuan. The rate once strengthened to where it could be settled at the above price, but soon softened again, showing signs of stabilization. At the 3:30 PM closing, spot prices to August futures were all British exchange at 3 shillings and 0.09375 pence, U.S. dollars at 5.15625 yuan, compared to last Saturday's noon closing, the British rate was up by 0.046875 and the U.S. rate was up by 0.03125.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rises by Four Yuan

Hong Kong, 28th (Monday): The exchange market opened this morning with trading but no market. The spot rate for Shanghai currency rose alone by four yuan, to 475 yuan (last Saturday's noon closing was 471 yuan). The rest remained unchanged (the spot rate for U.S. dollars last Saturday's noon closing was 24.625 yuan).

Tianjin British and U.S. Currencies Both Tighten Sharply

Tianjin, 28th (Monday): The exchange market opened flat this morning. London telegraphic transfers tightened sharply by 375, to 3 shillings and 4.0625 pence. New York telegraphic transfers declined sharply by 59375, to 5.625 yuan. Shanghai currency fell by 11.5 yuan, to 74 yuan. Joint currency on the black market rose by six yuan, to 55 yuan.

Nearly Two Thousand Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot silver prices rise as high as 8,4500 yuan, causing British and U.S. gold pounds to rise as high as 195 yuan and 198 yuan. Subsequently, following the decline in gold prices, the result was still a rise of eight yuan. British gold tickets ultimately rose by 5 jiao (cents). U.S. dollar tickets opened at 1,960 yuan. After opening, Da Chang, Shuntai, Cheng Zhi Cheng and others competed to buy, pushing it to 97 yuan. Then, suddenly, Tongyu, Xiangxing, Yongshuntai, Cheng and others sold out, and the market closed at 65 yuan. In the afternoon, trading continued to decline to 1,900 yuan. After opening, Ying Tai, Xiangao, Shun Tai Cheng, and others bought back up to 45 yuan. Shuntai Cheng sold again, dropping to 10 yuan. Lee Kee and retail investors bought slightly. The night closing was 1,925 yuan, up by 30 yuan compared to last week. Hong Kong tickets also trended bullish. In addition, tickets for Singapore, Annam, Robbie, Canada, and the Philippines also tended to rise. Japanese gold tickets rose and then returned to flat. The night market was still posted at 2 yuan and 1 jiao (cent) on the original disk. Korean tickets trended steady, and the night market rose to 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen (cents).

### Soaring and Plunging: The Gold Market Is Like a Horse Without Reins; Cash Gold Creates an Unprecedented High Price of 8,350 Yuan

Yesterday's black market price of smelted gold changed dramatically after the U.S. government announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds over the weekend. The previous day, Sunday, was a public holiday. Unexpectedly, on receipt of the 26th New York telegraphic transfer, the U.S. dollar exchange rate against Shanghai currency was only 4.3 yuan, a huge drop of 1.17 yuan. People in the gold industry were even more panicked. Inquiries to Reuters revealed that the telegraphic transfer was probably an error, and therefore it was not possible to open on time. At the brokers' general meeting, there were proposals to temporarily settle long and short positions based on last weekend's black market price of the U.S. dollar at 5.1875 yuan and the HSBC small counter price of the U.S. dollar at 5.125 yuan. There were also arguments for opening as usual. Amidst the indecision, news came that HSBC had posted its rates. Except for French, German, and Japanese exchange rates, which had no rates, the rest were posted as usual. Subsequently, the small counter U.S. dollar price was still showing 5.125 yuan. Therefore, it was decided to open for business as usual at 10 AM. The opening price had already been raised by 100 yuan. Although the gold firms were selling, the foreign exchange rate tightened, and the U.S. dollar softened to 5 yuan. Dealers from the Shanghai West area and securities houses and bill merchants were buying heavily, so after 10:45 AM, the upward trend intensified, rising from 6,630 yuan to a high price of 6,960 yuan. Near noon, the U.S. dollar stopped tightening and rebounded slightly, and the price also retreated by 100 yuan. After the close, news of the U.S.-Japan conflict caused a drop to 6,500 yuan, all informal prices outside the market. However, after the market opened in the afternoon, there was a drop of 150 yuan, after which the price was raised again to around 6,700 yuan, ultimately rising by 90 yuan. Total trading volume was 70,000 to 80,000 taels, mostly settlement. The swap (July into August) had sellers posting 70 yuan to buyers. Cash gold soared alarmingly, reaching an unprecedented high price, breaking through the 8,000 yuan mark. Heshun sold 50 taels to Shihe at a price of 8,020 yuan. Yiyuan sold 40 taels, and Shunyuan sold 10 taels, all bought by Bei Qingyun at a price of 8,200 yuan. Heshun then sold 50 taels to a jewelry store for 8,300 yuan. The gold firm then sold 20 taels to a jewelry store for 8,390 yuan, an unprecedented high price. In the afternoon, Shihe sold 50 taels to a jewelry store for 8,300 yuan. Later, there were sellers at a slight decline to 8,300 yuan, up by more than 800 yuan compared to last Saturday, marking one of the largest increases since trading began. Jewelry gold once rose by 120 yuan, reaching 880 yuan, and finally 850 yuan, rising by 90 yuan, also breaking all previous records for the degree of increase.

### Grain: Are Rice Merchants Still Unsatisfied? Arbitrarily Raising Prices Without Relenting. Foreign Rice Rises by Seven Dollars... Glutinous Rice Rises by Ten Dollars.

The foreign rice market is experiencing an increasingly severe surge. The high expectations of the rice merchants that they could advance south has been realized, as the Vietnamese problem has escalated into freezing and counter-freezing. They also anticipate further obstruction to transportation. When the stored rice is exhausted, they can arbitrarily raise prices, and any high price can fulfill their desires. Therefore, the market is entirely manipulated by speculative groups, while genuine customers are holding back due to the high prices. Market transactions, apart from a small number of genuine sales, are mostly speculative activities.

It is said that when the current rice arrives, regardless of whether it is from Jardine Matheson (英華司) or Mitsui & Co. (市石), it is welcomed by hoarding merchants. However, there are concerns that rice en route may be obstructed, so the price of first-grade Saigon current rice is 132 yuan; original packaged current rice is 147.5 yuan; smaller sacks are 125 yuan; Jardine Matheson current rice is between 149 yuan and 151.5 yuan; futures are between 148 yuan and 149.5 yuan; first-grade Siamese rice is a special 140 yuan; second-grade Siamese rice is 124 yuan; rice en route is between 142.5 yuan and 144 yuan; broken rice is 108 yuan; Mindang Zhongguan is 124-125 yuan; special Jiafo rice is 134 yuan; Zhongguan is 124-125 yuan; small sacks are 124-125 yuan; Tokyo sharp tip is 115-116 yuan, decided at 112 yuan; broken tip is 96-97 yuan, decided at 93 yuan. These prices are 1, 3, 5, or 7 yuan higher than the previous day. Jardine Matheson traded 2,000 tons, Mitsui & Co. 25,000 bags.

The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice has arrived continuously. The Jardine Matheson Yuesheng (裕生) steamer arrived in Shanghai last Saturday afternoon, carrying 17,171 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong for the Shanghai Municipal Council. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. It is reported that 3,086 bags of foreign rice will be shipped to Tianjin today, and 528 bags of corn will be shipped to Yantai to be loaded onto a certain British ship.

Due to the erratic weather and uncertain sources, as well as the soaring price of foreign rice, domestic rice owners are even more determined to sell at high prices and hoard their goods, making them scarce and expensive. Local shopkeepers are also holding onto their goods, believing that scarcity makes them valuable. Not only do they not mind the high prices, but they are also increasingly keen to buy, competing with each other for fear of missing out. As a result, rice owners are able to sell at high prices, and both thick and thin glutinous rice have unexpectedly reached high prices. Fresh Nankang early and late rice reached 154-151 yuan; Wuxi original packaged glutinous rice is 142-138 yuan, a huge increase of more than ten yuan, setting a new record for the rice market, which is truly a great misfortune for the people's food supply.

In this environment, glutinous rice is also following suit, displaying its beauty. Hong Kong white glutinous rice has reached 125-126 yuan, decided at around 120 yuan; glutinous green beans are 116 yuan, decided at 113 yuan; domestic glutinous rice is scarce and has no market.

### Flour Soaring

The current foreign flour market is experiencing a strong surge, influenced by the U.S. freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds and financial changes, which has boosted confidence. Japanese merchants were the first to purchase and ship to North China, followed by hoarding merchants, and the "kicking the ball" trading is even more active. Therefore, the market is becoming increasingly expensive. Golden Dragon flour is priced at 33.85-33.5 yuan; Fortress flour is 34.725 yuan, more than one yuan higher than last weekend. The sales of miscellaneous brands are also active. Yandou brand is 33-33.1 yuan; Shuangying is 33 yuan; and the local factory's Bingchuan brand is also priced at 34 yuan. The price increases are all rapid, with a total of over 30,000 bags traded, equally divided between genuine sales and hoarding.

More foreign flour has arrived in Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson Yuesheng steamer arrived on the 26th, carrying a large quantity of foreign rice for the Shanghai Municipal Council, as well as 2,000 bags of flour, which have already been unloaded. (Year)

Yesterday, due to weather conditions, the supply of new wheat was even scarcer in the suburbs. Apart from a few scattered purchases by Japanese factories, there were no whole transactions. However, the market was influenced by the financial upheaval, and sellers were all demanding high prices, making the situation very firm.

### Ban on Export of Oil and Food, Miscellaneous Grains Still Being Arbitrarily Raised

Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains market was shaken by financial rumors, and people were quite nervous. The usual opportunistic merchants began to manipulate and raise prices, so prices were all pushed up and soared. As a result, cooking oil rose by 7, 8, or 9 yuan, while soybeans and corn rose by 1 to 2 yuan. Jiaozhou raw oil was 300 pieces, priced at 153 yuan; Qingdao raw oil was 80 barrels, priced at 215-218.5 yuan; Dalian soybean oil was 130 barrels, priced at 215-217 yuan; Dayou factory refined oil was nearly 10,000 piculs, with July delivery priced at 147.25-152.25 yuan; August delivery priced at 152-153.25 yuan; and late August delivery priced at 149-154.75 yuan. Tianjin Jinyuan was 200 bags, priced at 50 yuan; Jiaozhou soybeans were 100 bags, priced at 49 yuan; Guide soybeans were 700 bags, priced at 46.5-46.7 yuan; Saigon and Dutch corn were over 10,000 bags, priced at 31-28.7 yuan. However, customs has announced that oil and food products are prohibited from export, while miscellaneous grains are still being arbitrarily raised. It is feared that this situation may not last long.

Also, 85 pieces of raw oil arrived from Qingdao yesterday, and 1,500 pieces of soybean cake will be shipped to Siam today.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market is a Mess, Both Long and Short Positions are Empty... A Comedy of Errors.

The cotton yarn market is experiencing a turbulent surge, with prices rising and falling sharply, causing great fear. This situation is rare in the history of the yarn industry, suggesting that there are many pitfalls for speculators. However, public sentiment remains enthusiastic. In short, in this unpredictable international situation, the risks are extremely high. Initially, due to the U.S. freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds and the continuous rise in U.S. cotton prices, as well as the surge in margin calls, speculators in the market followed the trend and pushed prices up, reaching a high of 1,685 yuan. The closing situation was still stable. Unexpectedly, after 12 o'clock, the market underwent a huge change, with rumors that customs had banned the export of cotton yarn, leading to a surge in sellers and a drop of 30 yuan. In the afternoon, sellers flocked in, and the market plummeted, reaching a low of 1,560 yuan, a difference of 125 yuan from the morning's high. The final price was 1,575 yuan. In short, the current yarn market is such that being short is empty, and being long is also feared to be empty. Who ultimately wins or loses money?

The Shuangma morning opening showed a tight situation, as U.S. cotton continued to rise and buying sentiment remained strong. The opening price was 1,640 yuan. At this time, the market was chaotic. Shortly after, it rose to 1,650 yuan, then suddenly fell to 1,635 yuan. This price fluctuated for a long time. Later, upon hearing of a surge in margin calls, people panicked, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions, sending the market straight up to 1,685 yuan. At the closing, it was still high, at 1,673 yuan. However, after the scattered market closed, due to negative news, there was a large sell-off, falling 30-40 yuan to 1,635 yuan. The half-day transaction statistics show 9,190 yuan. The amounts bought by various groups are as follows: Tianjin 10, Hong Kong 180, fellow traders 9,000, total 9,190.

It has been found that 22 pieces of cotton yarn, which had been approved by customs for release, were shipped to Yantai today, and 255 pieces were shipped to Siam.

The Jinbian Ma futures yarn market continued to be tight at the beginning of the morning session. August futures were 1,495 yuan, up 6 yuan; September futures were 1,565 yuan, up 11 yuan; October futures were 1,575 yuan, up 15 yuan. Subsequently, as the foreign exchange contraction continued to be strong and gold prices continued to soar, gold shops and securities firms showed strong buying interest, and short sellers painfully covered their positions, causing the market price to rise step by step. August futures reached a high of 1,552 yuan, September futures reached 1,610 yuan, and October futures reached 1,640 yuan. As the price increase was too rapid, long positions took profits at high prices. August fell back slightly by 27 yuan, September fell back slightly by 13 yuan. There were many buyers in October, and the price remained high to consolidate. The midday close showed August futures up 36 yuan, September futures up 43 yuan, and October futures up a staggering 80 yuan, with 17,330 bags traded. The after-market opening saw a sharp change in sentiment due to negative rumors, and selling pressure was strong. August futures suddenly fell 75 yuan, September futures fell 47 yuan, and October futures fell 70 yuan. Later, sellers continued to pour in, and August futures fell as low as 1,450 yuan, September futures fell to 1,526 yuan, and October futures fell to 1,513 yuan. Gradually, there was a slight recovery. The evening close showed August futures down 24 yuan compared to last Saturday, September futures down 28 yuan, and October futures down 45 yuan. The largest difference between the high and low prices for the entire day was in October futures, reaching 127 yuan. The closing price was 11 yuan lower than September futures. The total volume traded for the day was 36,910 bags, an increase of 14,910 bags compared to the previous day. The full-day opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded on the left (net floor quotes).

### Cotton Also Unstable

The current cotton situation is generally good. Due to the continued rise in U.S. cotton prices, people are quite confident. However, the slump in cotton yarn has led to the raw materials, which are closely linked, being unable to escape the fate of the finished goods, pushing prices up. Recently, there has been a congestion of arrivals, which are being kept hidden. This makes the future unstable.

### Securities: Debt Market Leans Bullish, Absurd Talk

The grey market for government bonds yesterday saw turbulent waves in various speculative markets. People were already feeling very weak, and rumors were rife, all unfavorable to the long side. For example, it was said that the principal and interest due on bonds would be problematic, which was simply baseless. At the morning opening, the long side took the initiative. Class C bonds opened at 71 yuan, then gradually fell, dropping 9 jiao. Renchang, Tongkang, Hongda, and Yichang bought in, mostly to cover short positions. Xiexingyuan and Yitai released large quantities, and Xie Kang also sold. In the afternoon, they broke through the 70 yuan mark again. Gongmao, Songmao, and Yichang bought in. Hongda released again, and Xietai and Xinfu released. Tongxing also sold off, and Tongshun sold. The market situation was very weak. Due to the persistence of rumors, selling pressure gradually increased, and there were no signs of improvement in the short term. As a result, market prices fell all the way back by 7.5 jiao to 1.2 yuan, with a turnover of approximately 2 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.

In stock trading, 200 shares of China Merchants Electric Company were traded at a price of 7.9 yuan.

Also, the stock market at the Public Industry Association opened weakly, and selling pressure gradually expanded. Prices continued to fall. As a result, both industrial stocks and rubber stocks suffered heavy losses.

### Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Soaring, Almost Becoming a Seller's Market, Obstacles to Exports Cause the Market to Fall Back

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market soared due to the sudden and sharp contraction in the foreign exchange market. People were unanimously bullish, and hoarding merchants showed strong interest, causing selling prices to soar, almost becoming a seller's market. Later, due to customs announcing that eight types of goods, including cotton cloth, were not allowed to be freely exported, the market gradually returned to normal. Fugui fine cloth reached a high of 47.25 yuan, up one yuan from last Saturday, but gradually fell to 46.35 yuan in the afternoon, with transactions still up 1 jiao. The remaining grades of fine cloth and twill rose by about 5 jiao, while coarse cloth rose by about 1.5 yuan per piece. The price of bleached and dyed cloth was even more chaotic, rising by about 5 jiao. The street traded over 500 pieces of various cloths. The Cantonese and Hong Kong merchants traded over 200 pieces of bleached and dyed coarse cloth twill. The Beilu Yanyang merchants traded over 100 pieces of coarse cloth and flannel.

Dong cloth rose and fell sharply. In the spot market, the Longtou silk fabric saw a high of 54.2 yuan, and colored Si Jun Zi serge saw 1.74 yuan. Subsequently, as margin calls for cotton yarn fell back, sentiment eased, and prices gradually declined. In the after-market, the futures market for Exchange cloth only rose by 1 jiao to 3 jiao per piece compared to last weekend. However, the spot market was still being searched for and hoarded by hoarding merchants, and dyeing needs were being absorbed by genuine sales. Therefore, the Longtou factory order still increased by 9 jiao, with the closing price being 50.09 yuan. The evening close for serge fell to 1.64125 yuan.

Exports: 310 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Siam today (the 19th), and 30 pieces were shipped to Penang. These were likely those that had already been approved for release by customs.

### Hardware: Steel Bars Soar by 50 Yuan

The market for ribbed steel bars, influenced by financial changes, is trending higher along with other hardware products. It has been found that since the previous day, the price has increased by up to 50 yuan per ton. However, genuine sales are sluggish due to the scattered business of out-of-town merchants and the quiet activity of construction businesses in the street. Although the transaction volume is insignificant, the industry's sentiment remains very strong. Although there is no immediate risk of running out of stock, due to the termination of transpacific shipping, purchasers are instead increasing their purchases, so there is still concern that these goods may disappear. Therefore, those holding the goods are reluctant to easily sell them off. Yesterday, 3/8 and 1/2 inch steel bars were selling for 3,100 yuan per ton, while 5/8 to 1 inch steel bars required 3,050 yuan.

### Kampuchean Lead Rises Again

The price of Kampuchean lead has risen again in the past three days, mainly due to the freezing of funds. However, the lack of supply and the hoarding by merchants are also the only reasons for the shortage of this commodity. As a result, people in the industry are speculating, and those holding the goods are unwilling to sell, causing prices to rise rapidly. Yesterday, the price had already risen from 530 yuan to around 550-560 yuan per picul.

### Detailed Measures for Handling China's Foreign Trade to be Announced Soon, Foreign Banks Association is Negotiating, Serious Impact After Freezing of Japanese Assets

Before the U.S. issued the order to freeze Japanese assets, the U.S. Treasury Department had already issued various licenses to take various precautionary measures in case commercial relations between Hawaii and the Philippines and China and Japan were interrupted. In addition, it authorized 14 well-known banks to handle import and export trade matters between any part of China and the UK, the US, South America, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. According to reports from banks such as Citibank, HSBC, and Holland banks, the measures for handling China's foreign trade are being negotiated by the Foreign Banks Association and may be announced today. As for U.S.-Japanese commercial relations, the commercial relations between the two countries have been completely suspended because the freezing order includes Japanese funds and property in the U.S. A summary of the situation is as follows:

Freezing Scope is Extremely Broad

Regarding the scope of the U.S. government's freezing of Japanese funds, the Allied News Agency's Washington dispatch on the 25th, as reported by the Japanese mainland newspaper, stated that the scope of the freezing order issued by the U.S. Treasury Department includes both funds and property, including cash, checks, bills, gold bullion, silver bullion, bank deposits, government bonds and interest coupons, stocks, mortgages, bills of lading, manufactured goods, commodities, household property, ships and their cargo, land sales contracts, land lease rights, ground rent, bearer deeds, receipts, account books, commercial contracts, land usage fees, franchises, trademark rights, copyrights, annuities, bonuses, etc. If it can be thoroughly implemented, the impact on Japan will be very serious. However, the outside world does not know the details and there may be misunderstandings.

British and American Banks Comply with Orders

British and American commercial banks have uniformly implemented the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds since yesterday. For U.S. dollar and British pound deposits of Chinese and Japanese commercial banks and merchants, if they wish to withdraw them, they will be paid with New York and London drafts. However, these drafts cannot be cashed or transferred in New York or London, which is very inconvenient for depositors. Therefore, to take care of the interests of depositors, they will all be settled and sold to the original depositing banks in accordance with the Shanghai black market foreign exchange rate, and the original depositing banks will pay in general Chinese legal tender. This measure is the method for implementing the freeze. However, legal tender depositors in each bank are as usual and are not subject to any restrictions.

HSBC Suspends Japanese Exchange Rate

The British HSBC Bank suspended the foreign exchange rate yesterday morning. The British exchange rate was 3 shillings 1.25 pence, and the U.S. exchange rate was 5.125 yuan, both shrinking 0.0625. However, there was no market for the Japanese exchange rate. New foreign exchange transactions by each bank are limited to old customers with whom they have dealings and must be subject to review and permission. Speculators will be rejected uniformly. However, yesterday's transactions were mostly liquidations. The actual transaction market rate, after the opening, the British exchange rate shrank to 3 shillings 0.0625 pence, and the U.S. exchange rate shrank to 5 yuan. Since 14 allied banks are willing to supply the legitimate needs of various industries, the foreign exchange market has eased slightly. The afternoon closing saw the British exchange rate at 3 shillings 1.140625 pence and the U.S. exchange rate at 5.1875 yuan.

Temporary Measures for Chinese Banks

Before the Chinese government issues an order, because all the foreign exchange of various Chinese banks deposited in the UK and the US have been frozen, temporary measures are being taken to deal with foreign exchange depositors, the same as the measures taken by British and American commercial banks, paying with New York and London drafts, or converting and paying in legal tender. The conversion rate is calculated according to the actual transaction market rate in the Shanghai black market. It is said that new foreign exchange transactions have virtually stopped, but as of last night, no order has been received from the government.

Stabilization Fund Maintains Market Stability

In order to take care of the business of legitimate merchants, the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee declared that it would continue to maintain the Shanghai exchange rate. After the opening of the foreign exchange market yesterday, it contracted sharply and then relaxed and lengthened. It is believed that the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has instructed various allied banks to come out and maintain the exchange rate, so there is no doubt that the Shanghai exchange rate can be permanently stabilized from now on. Yesterday, the various markets gradually stabilized due to the easing of the exchange rate. For example, the gold market opened at 6,710 yuan, rose to 6,960 yuan, and fell to 6,700 yuan at the afternoon close. Cotton yarn, after soaring, fell back to 1,570 yuan at the close. Therefore, the prices of other commodities have also fallen back.

Commercial Relations Between the Two Countries on the Verge of Collapse

When the United States announced the freezing of Japanese funds on the evening of the 25th, the Tokyo Daily News contacted its New York-based correspondent, Hosokawa, via international wireless telephone, to inquire about the true intention of the United States in taking this action and its impact on Japan. Hosokawa explained his views, which can be summarized into several points and are worth noting: (1) If President Roosevelt's order is thoroughly implemented, with assets frozen and trade controlled, the relationship between the United States and Japan will be completely destroyed. According to estimates by the U.S. Department of Commerce, excluding ships, the assets of Japan that have been frozen amount to 130 million yuan, but the actual amount may be more than this. Currently, there are about 60,000 to 70,000 Japanese people in the US and London. In general, the measures adopted by the United States are the same as those taken against Germany and Italy. Currently, the living expenses of individual German and Italian expatriates are limited to only 50 U.S. dollars. Legitimate businesses can also apply for approval, but the movement of every penny must be approved by the authorities. Therefore, the lives of expatriates will be restricted from now on, so the situation is very serious.

### Amended Land Regulations Annexes Approved by Treaty Powers, Expansion of Powers Conflicts with Land Regulations, Informed Sources Express Great Confusion

According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's information office yesterday, "The Shanghai Municipal Council recently announced that the proposed new annexes 43 to 52 to the Land Regulations, as well as the amendments to the existing annexes 30 and 36 (stated in the Shanghai Municipal Council's English Gazette on March 31 of this year, and approved by the amendment to item 3 of the Special Meeting of Foreign Ratepayers on April 17 of this year), have been approved by most of the consuls and diplomatic representatives of the treaty powers."

Summary of the Contents of the New Annexes

According to the original Land Regulations Annexes, there are a total of 42 articles, all related to the management of ditches, building construction, road management, garbage removal, business licenses, traffic regulations, temporary offenders, and penalties for disobeying consular orders. The new annexes are articles 43 to 52, totaling ten articles. Articles 43 to 51 are related to physician registration, reporting and isolation of infectious diseases, penalties for infectious patients revealing themselves without permission, vaccination, death registration, penalties for overcrowding houses, house inspections, and prohibition of spitting. Article 52 is important and is divided into three categories. The first paragraph is the valuation of real estate, houses, rents, or goods. The second paragraph is the organization of the valuation committee. The third paragraph is the expansion of the powers of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating that "When the decision of the Shanghai Municipal Council or the Board of Appeal becomes a final decision and has legal effect, the Shanghai Municipal Council may implement this decision and collect donations and taxes in accordance with Article 10 (Article 20 of the Regulations) of the Land Regulations."

Expansion of Powers Not in Compliance with the Law

According to Article 11 of the Land Regulations, the Board of Directors has the right to make additional annexes at any time, and may cancel, change, or amend the annexes, but this should only be implemented after obtaining the approval of the consuls and ministers of the treaty powers or a majority of them, and passing a special meeting of foreign ratepayers. However, the same article stipulates that "This additional annex shall not conflict with the provisions of the Land Regulations." Therefore, there is no doubt that Article 53 of the new annexes this spring, which expands the tax collection powers of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is fundamentally in conflict with the Land Regulations and is not in compliance with the law. However, the illegal matter has been "approved by most of the consuls and diplomatic representatives of the treaty powers," which is truly confusing to informed sources.

### The French Concession Authorities Strictly Limit Rice Prices; Rice Merchants Have Been Notified to Sell at Fixed Prices; The Market Management Committee Closed the Market Early Yesterday

Due to the Far East Incident and the conclusion of an agreement between Vietnam and Japan, rice prices in the rice market have soared, exceeding the average prices of recent weeks significantly. However, this price increase is unreasonable, and the French Concession authorities have decided to crack down on it. Rice merchants are hereby notified that retail rice prices should still adhere to the prices of July 25th as the standard, and no price increases to customers are allowed without the permission of the Evaluation Committee. In short, the French Concession authorities have decided that no price increases will be allowed unless there are genuine documents to prove that the price increase is justified.

Freezing Foreign Exchange is Unrelated to the Rice Market

Since U.S. President Roosevelt announced the freezing of funds of China and Japan in the United States, some unscrupulous speculative rice merchants have taken the opportunity to stir up trouble and raise rice prices. This illegal activity is particularly noteworthy. Yesterday, after the rice market opened at 10:00 AM, people were panicked, and rumors abounded. Major players insisted on hoarding goods and were unwilling to release them easily, resulting in a very chaotic market situation. In fact, the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds by the United States and Britain has nothing to do with the rice market, because the foreign rice handled by the Public Works Department is done by British trading houses, which can freely remit funds to Hong Kong, Burma, and other places to purchase Xiaojiao rice and Mindang rice. The Market Management Committee, in view of the rising rice prices, which were obviously caused by speculative rice merchants creating rumors and stirring up trouble, dispatched additional personnel to the market to closely monitor the buying and selling of the industry, and strongly urged them to abide by the market rules and not engage in irregular transactions. If anyone is found to be involved in illegal transactions, whether known or unknown, they will be immediately arrested and sent to the police for investigation.

Raising Rice Prices Leads to Early Market Closure

Yesterday's rice market trading was due to speculative rice merchants deliberately fabricating falsehoods, which led to frequent increases in the prices of both domestic and foreign rice. The price of foreign rice increased by four to five yuan per stone compared to the previous market (last Saturday), and the price of domestic rice soared by as much as eight to nine yuan per stone. The highest price of foreign rice has now been pushed up to 132 yuan, and the price of domestic rice is 154 yuan. In these two days, the prices of all kinds of rice have been raised by an average of seven yuan per stone, and the chaos in the market is unprecedented in the past one or two months. This is purely due to the mischief of unscrupulous rice merchants. The Rice Market Management Committee, in view of the fact that the rice prices have been raised again, which not only hinders the livelihood of the common people, but also affects social security, decided to close the market early at 11:00 AM to prevent rice merchants from continuing to be active.

Existing Rice Reserves are Sufficient for August

After the rice market closed early yesterday, all the members of the market committee felt that the long-stable rice market had suddenly become turbulent again, which was a great loss of the consistent principles that had been followed in the past. Fearing that the previously agreed-upon measures would become ineffective over time, the members convened an informal meeting after the market closed. They all agreed that the city's food reserves were very substantial, and there was no fear of shortage in the future. The existing rice reserves are sufficient to meet the needs of the city's four million residents for eight months, but speculators are raising prices in the market and engaging in various illegal transactions, affecting the overall supply of food for the people, which is not a trivial matter. It was then resolved that the various effective measures that had been previously established would be strictly enforced, and that anyone who deliberately violated them would be punished in accordance with the regulations.

The Authorities are Paying Attention to Illegal Activities

According to the authorities of the concessions yesterday, the authorities of the two concessions have paid close attention to the various illegal activities of unscrupulous rice merchants. Anyone who raises rice prices without authorization, or deliberately hides large quantities of rice and refuses to release them, will be severely punished according to the law if the investigation proves it to be true. In addition, the authorities will continue to purchase low-priced foreign rice without interruption. If anyone knows that there are large quantities of rice and has no intention of selling it in the market, they can report it to the authorities in secret. However, the residents of the city sincerely hope that the authorities will restore the evaluation of domestic and foreign rice, announce it to the market, and strictly enforce it, so as to prevent speculative rice merchants from frequently raising the prices of domestic and foreign rice without authorization, and to maintain the stability of the entire rice market.

### Japanese Soldiers in Yangshupu Were Ambushed; It is Reported that They Were Hit by Dumdum Bullets; They Died Four Hours After Being Wounded; Several People Have Been Arrested in the Shooting Case in Xujiahui; A House-to-House Search Has Been Conducted in the Haig Road and Tushanwan Area

On Saturday night at about 9:00 PM, Japanese sailor Tokuzen Zento was ambushed by a Chinese person in Yangshupu. He was hit by a bullet in the lower chest. He was rushed to the Japanese naval hospital for emergency treatment. Because the injury was to a vital part of the body, he could not be saved. He died at 1:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 27th), four hours after being wounded. The Japanese side reported that the soldier was hit by a dumdum bullet. The Japanese Marines were particularly indignant about this.

The Shooter Could Not Be Found

After receiving the news of the shooting, the Japanese military headquarters immediately closed all the bridges over the Suzhou River and conducted a large-scale search in the Yangshupu area, but the perpetrator was not found. As of late the day before yesterday, the perpetrator was still at large. The shooting took place at the intersection of Kunming Road and Baoding Road. Zento and another Japanese soldier were searching pedestrians. At 9:10 PM, they saw a Chinese person with a suspicious appearance at the intersection of Kunming Road and Elco Road and ordered him to stop. The Chinese person ran away. Zento hurriedly chased after him. When he chased to the intersection of Kunming Road and Baoding Road, the Chinese person suddenly took out a pistol and fired two shots in retreat. Zento was hit by a bullet and fell to the ground. The shooter then abandoned the gun and fled across the open space west of Elco Road. Although a search was conducted afterward, he could not be found.

Another Japanese Soldier's Injuries are Not Serious

At about 9:00 PM on the night before last (the 27th), a Japanese soldier was suddenly ambushed near the Xujiahui Observatory in West Shanghai. The shooting incident was only about twenty hours apart from the shooting incident in Yangshupu. It was reported that when the shooting incident occurred the night before, three Japanese soldiers were guarding near the Xujiahui Observatory. Unexpectedly, they were shot from behind, with about ten bullets fired. One Japanese soldier was slightly injured, and the other two were not injured. They did not have time to turn around and return fire, and the perpetrator had already fled. Yesterday, the military police received a report and rushed to the scene, setting up a cordon around the area and conducting an investigation. They arrested several suspects yesterday morning before lifting the cordon. The Xujiahui Observatory was within the cordoned area, so the weather report could not be sent out this morning. It is reported that the injured Japanese soldier's injuries are not serious.

Traffic is Interrupted and the Situation is Tense

It is said that at about 9:00 PM the night before last, a Japanese sentry in Tushanwan, West Shanghai, was shot and wounded by several bullets. According to reliable sources, the incident occurred in front of the Leisui Middle School of the Xujiahui Catholic Church. Although the shooter fired his gun, the Japanese sentry was not hit or injured, and the perpetrator fled into the darkness. Afterward, the situation in the Haig Road area suddenly became tense. The Japanese immediately declared a traffic interruption, and entry and exit at the junction of the Chinese and French concessions were prohibited. It was not until 11:30 AM yesterday that it was reopened as usual.

Shops are Closed and Vegetables are Blocked

The areas around the scene, such as Tangjie West, Huixi Street, and several sections of Ciyou Road, were still blocked and sealed off until last night. Japanese soldiers were conducting a house-to-house search, so all the shops in the south end of Haig Road and the Xujiahui area were unable to operate and were closed all day. The Hongqiao Road railway crossing and the Xietu Road intersection in Tushanwan were also sealed off, and vegetables and other items could not enter the market. Hundreds of loads of vegetables were accumulated outside the cordon, stretching for more than a mile. Until about 10:00 AM, they were still unable to pass, and the vegetable vendors had to return home in disappointment.

### Preventing the Disparity in Wealth Distribution; Strictly Implementing the Excessive Profit Tax; If Anyone Relies on Their Power to Evade or Refuse to Pay, the Authorities Should Impose Severe Punishments According to the Law

According to qualified financial figures, the performance of the excessive profit tax is far from ideal, even worse than the income tax. The levy of excessive profit tax was originally intended to be a moderate sanction against unjust war profiteers. Today, the domestic commerce of China exhibits abnormal development, such as the flourishing of speculative businesses, the soaring of prices, and the increase in profits, all of which cause deep unease in society. The anti-aggression and nation-building plans are also affected. The levy of profit tax, in theory, was originally intended to eliminate unjust profits, correct the tendency of national economic imbalances, promote social justice, and prevent the disparity in wealth distribution. However, in reality, the levy of profit tax in China is still far from achieving the aforementioned goals. One reason is that the tax rate is not high, and another is that although the target of the levy is ordinary business organizations, there are many people who rely on their power to evade taxes, and even a few who openly resist taxes, which makes the implementation of this new tax system difficult. The impact is not only a reduction in revenue. It is hoped that the authorities will enforce the law strictly and that public opinion will impose sanctions, so as to completely eliminate this undesirable phenomenon.

### The Japanese Ship "Hokkai Maru" is Ordered to Suspend its Voyage to Rangoon; The "Nitta Maru's" Voyage to America is also Likely to be Canceled; It Appears that Japan's International Shipping is About to be Completely Suspended

The situation between the United States and Japan is becoming increasingly tense. First, the U.S. controls on imports and exports have had a considerable impact on Japan. Now, with the freezing of funds to Japan, Japan has suffered a fatal blow. Japanese shipping companies are likely to suspend voyages to America and then to Southeast Asia. The Osaka Company's "Hokkai Maru," which was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Rangoon tomorrow, has been temporarily ordered to suspend its departure. It is now moored at the Qichang Wharf, awaiting orders. The NYK Line's "Nitta Maru," which is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 30th) and depart from Shanghai to the United States via Japan on the 31st, is also likely to be unable to make the trip. According to current observations, Japan's international shipping has already been completely suspended.

### The Price Increases in This City are Purely a Temporary Reaction; It is Expected That After Speculative Activities Disappear, Prices Will Fall and Living Conditions Will Improve

Since the U.S. government implemented the freezing of assets of China and Japan, the industrial and commercial circles of this port have expressed their satisfaction. However, some speculators have taken the opportunity to create various lies and engage in large-scale activities in the market, attempting to stimulate prices and achieve their own selfish desires. Therefore, the prices of various daily necessities in Shanghai have recently risen uniformly. A reporter from Dazhong News Agency interviewed a gentleman from the financial sector yesterday to ask for his opinion.

Prices Will Definitely Trend Downward in the Future

According to reports, the U.S. has approved China's request to freeze assets in the United States, which is of great benefit to China's future. The difficult life of the people for the past four years can be expected to improve, and various prices can also return to normal. Although the freezing of assets and the subsequent application for foreign exchange have not yet been officially announced, it is a fact that speculators can no longer use black market to engage in speculation. As for the various necessities for the people that need to be purchased with foreign exchange, a reasonable level of supply can be obtained. Therefore, prices will definitely trend downward in the future, but the prices of luxury goods may have to be raised.

Preventing Arbitrage and Eliminating Speculation

The government's resolute request to the United States to freeze Chinese assets at the same time has two main goals, according to my personal speculation: (1) to prevent Japan from using funds in the occupied areas of China to purchase foreign exchange, so that the U.S.'s policy of freezing Japan will be fully effective, giving a major blow to the aggressors. Since Japan has no way to purchase weapons, the war can take a sharp turn for the worse, causing the aggressor's fortress to collapse quickly and realizing true world peace as soon as possible. (2) To prevent speculators from using black market exchange rates to manipulate prices.

Market Chaos is a Temporary Phenomenon

As for the current abnormal price surge, it is within our expectations. There are also two reasons for this: (1) the black market has suddenly tightened during this chaotic period, because those who hold long positions are unwilling to sell easily, while those who hold short positions are doing their best to grab them. (2) Some foreign businessmen have withdrawn cash and transferred it back to their home countries due to the increasingly serious situation in the Far East, thus forming a tightening of the black market and stimulating price increases. However, this illegal activity will be temporary. Once the government's measures are announced, the chaotic market can be quickly cleared up, and prices will fall in a matter of time. Subsequently, the improvement of the lives of citizens will have an even greater guarantee.

### The Jianghai Customs Suddenly Announced Yesterday that Eight Types of Goods are Prohibited from Export; Including Machinery, Grain, Chemicals, Metals, Yarn, Cloth, etc.; Shipments to Various Occupied Areas of China are Not Subject to this Restriction

Since the governments of the United States and Britain ordered the freezing of materials in Japan and the occupied areas of China, Tokyo has taken retaliatory action in the same way. According to news from the shipping industry in this port yesterday, the Jianghai Customs, at the request of the Japanese Deputy Commissioner of Customs, issued a notice yesterday to stop handling customs declarations for various goods and to prohibit the export and transshipment of the original goods.

There are Eight Types of Prohibited Goods

The prohibited goods are: (1) machinery, (2) green beans, (3) grain, (4) oil, (5) chemicals, (6) minerals and metals, (7) fertilizers, and (8) yarn and cloth. The prohibited areas include not only the occupied areas of China, but also the unoccupied areas of China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and foreign ports. However, goods shipped by Japanese ships are not subject to this restriction.

Notifying All Ships to Stop Loading

This measure is obviously an attempt by the Japanese side to further implement the control of goods exports. The notice was a formal notice issued by the Customs at 11:00 AM yesterday. After the notice was issued, the above-mentioned goods were immediately stopped from being declared for export. Therefore, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and other foreign shipping companies in this port have notified all customs brokers to stop loading the above-mentioned goods.

The Prices of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Plummet

The items in this city rely on exports. Now that they are prohibited from being exported, all industries are in panic. The prices of various items plummeted yesterday afternoon. For example, 20-count cotton yarn was sold for 1,680 yuan yesterday morning, but plummeted to more than 1,560 yuan in the afternoon. Cotton cloth fell by more than two yuan per bolt. The prices of other export items all fell.

### The Hong Kong-Meixian Air Route is Being Planned for Operation; Extended from the Hong Kong-Shaoguan Line

The only air route between Hong Kong and the mainland is currently the Shaoguan route operated by China National Aviation Corporation. However, those traveling from Shanghai to the mainland must take the route to Rangoon and then transfer to the mainland. According to reports, the Guangdong Provincial Government has negotiated with Eurasia Aviation Corporation and is in the process of restoring the Hong Kong-Shaoguan line. The travel of overseas Chinese will be more convenient. Once the Hong Kong-Shaoguan line is realized, the route is expected to be extended to Meixian, Guangdong. The airport is planned to be located in Jiaoling. Meixian is a cultural hub, a transportation hub, and a developed commercial center. After the outbreak of the war, its position became more important. Maintaining the close connection of cargo transportation between Hong Kong and Meixian is reportedly being planned and considered for operation.

### Major Baowen is Scheduled to Return to the United States; It is Reported that He Has an Important Mission

Major Baowen, the director of the Public Security Department of the Public Concession, will leave Shanghai for the United States on Thursday. He may also return to Canada on the way to the United States. It is reported that Major Baowen's trip is for travel purposes, and his leave has been approved by his superiors. The duties he leaves behind during his leave will be temporarily taken over by Mr. Smith. However, it is said that Mr. Baowen's departure from Shanghai during the serious situation in the Far East must be related to the security measures taken here afterward and that he has an important mission.

### The Shanghai Volunteer Corps Has Abundant Strength

The strength of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession did not change during the past week. Although three members had resigned due to work-related reasons, three members had immediately joined. The Corps has 18 officers and members who have been awarded long service medals. Boutelote, who is serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, has been promoted to captain.

### European Countries Strictly Inspect Mail; The United States Does Not Inspect Transit Mail

Since mail between Shanghai and Europe is transported through the United States, European mail has been arriving in Shanghai successively in recent days. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, after the outbreak of the European war, various countries have implemented inspections of all types of mail. The European mail that has arrived in Shanghai in recent days has all been opened and inspected by the government, with seals and stamps affixed to the opened areas. The procedure is very thorough. Among them, the inspection of letters from Germany to Shanghai is the most strict. However, the U.S. government does not inspect transit mail transported through the United States.

### The Red Wood Workers' Strike Has Been Resolved Satisfactorily; A General Increase of One Yuan and Three Corners

The more than 200 red wood workers in this city had previously demanded an increase in wages from the employers, but their demands were not met. A strike broke out on the 9th of this month. Because the opinions of both sides were too far apart, a resolution could not be reached. Yesterday, with concessions from both sides, a satisfactory resolution was reached. The wages will be increased by one yuan and three corners across the board, and all workers resumed work yesterday.

### There is No Fear of Interruption in the Supply of Coal; The Market is Stable as Usual; Coal Merchants' Procurement of Goods Has Not Been Affected; Reserves are Substantial and There is No Fear of Shortage in the Future

Since the authorities of the two concessions, together with the Coal Industry Association, have actively sought to dredge the supply of briquettes needed daily by factories, households, rickshaws, restaurants, etc., in this city, foreign coal produced in India, Annam, and other places has continued to arrive on the way. The amount shipped to Shanghai each month is considerable. According to a coal magnate yesterday, there is no fear of interruption in the future shipment of foreign coal to Shanghai. At present, the shipping costs and transportation costs for transporting coal have not changed much compared to the past. At the same time, coal merchants' procurement of briquettes from various coal-producing areas overseas has not been affected and is as convenient as ever. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the increase in the cost of coal shipped to Shanghai in the future. Moreover, coal merchants' procurement of goods from overseas is orderly. Some are procuring bituminous coal, some are procuring anthracite, and some are procuring various coal fines. Once a transaction is completed, it is loaded onto ships and transported from the source. Therefore, the amount of coal shipped to Shanghai each month depends on the number of transactions each month. However, at present, coal merchants are still working tirelessly to procure briquettes.

The Authorities Will Assist

The authorities of the two concessions responsible for suppressing prices have always been deeply concerned about the city's entire fuel problem. They have repeatedly adopted effective measures to actively improve the coal market price, in order to automatically lower the price of briquettes and make it impossible for speculators to carry out their tricks and gradually eliminate them from the market. Therefore, transactions among coal merchants in the coal market have been quite stable in recent months. Under this circumstance, the prices of various briquettes have not changed much. Those who hold goods (except speculators) sell them on the market at the current price every day to realize cash. It is learned that the authorities of the two concessions will continue to implement various effective measures to stabilize the coal market. The authorities will assist in matters that the Coal Industry Association is unable to handle.

Coal Reserves are Unusually Substantial

According to another aspect of the investigation by reporters, the reserves of various large and small coal yards in the city are still unusually substantial as of now. Although there is no accurate investigation, according to those familiar with the coal market, the existing coal reserves, including anthracite, bituminous coal, and coal fines, amount to more than 300,000 tons. However, at present, due to the relocation of various factories and the reduction in consumption by residents and users, the consumption of briquettes has obviously decreased compared to the past. The existing coal reserves are enough to meet the needs of the city for four to five months, and there is no fear of shortage in the future. The above-mentioned coal reserves were all purchased several months ago, and the coal merchants' costs are very low.

Spot Goods Abound and the Market is Stable

The transactions of coal merchants at the coal market at No. 405 Tianjin Road are still stable as usual. The prices of various briquettes have not increased. Spot goods abound, and morale is low. Although speculative coal merchants are eager to move, they cannot carry out their old tricks. It is learned that the city's entire fuel problem, due to substantial reserves, continuous supply, and market conditions, will be stable for a long time. At the same time, the coal ball market has also not fluctuated. Both the black market and the open market maintain the original prices. It is hoped that citizens will remain calm and not listen to unfounded rumors, disturbing each other, so as not to provide an excuse for speculative coal merchants. If anyone knows that there are large quantities of coal balls or warehouse receipts that are not for sale, they can report them to the authorities, so that they can be secretly investigated and punished according to the law.

Low-Priced Coal Fines Continue to be Sold

The Shanghai Coal Industry Association, from January of this year, will work with the Yitaixing, Huazhong, and Yuantai, the four major companies of the Kaifeng Mining Bureau, to sell low-priced No. 3 coal fines, the purpose of which is to relieve the poor. Therefore, the industry will continue to exist for this good deed. The 32nd period of hot water store low-priced coal households is limited to one ton, at a low price of 80 yuan per ton. All hot water store owners can, from yesterday, bring their original seals and membership certificates of the Hot Water Store Association to the low-priced coal distribution office of the Coal Industry Association to obtain a "Coal Purchase Application Certificate" and then purchase from the Yitaixing, Huazhong, and Yuantai coal companies. However, it will end on the 31st.

### Japanese Merchants Dominate the Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Rights; "Ningbo Maru" Joins the Service

The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route has been seized by the Japanese East Asia Shipping Company, which operates ships on the route. Recently, it will also send the "Ningbo Maru" to join the service. Chinese merchants and ships of the Allied nations have been squeezed out. Details are recorded below:

Japanese Merchants Dominate

The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route has been directly approved by the Japanese Shipping Company from Tokyo, which has seized the shipping rights and operates one ship per week. The schedule is kept secret. Other Chinese and foreign merchants have been squeezed out. Passenger and cargo transport is still prosperous.

Adding Ships to the Service

It is said that the "Ningbo Maru," which is currently operating on the Yangtze River route, will also join the "Naruto Maru" in the service. Restrictions on passenger boarding are very strict, and it is necessary to first obtain a permit from the Japanese special agent agency on Dixwell Road. However, this permit is extremely difficult to obtain because the procedures are very troublesome.

Foreign Merchants are Excluded

The shipping lines that have always operated on the Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Wenzhou, and Shanghai-Shishi lines, such as the German companies Hai Fu, Gaoden, Hana, Haikang, Feikang, and Baoli, are now stranded in Shanghai. Moufu was detained in Zhoushan, and Changde and Avima Lee were detained in Yangshupu.

### Yesterday Morning in the French Concession: Two Bomb Discoveries

### Two Bombs Found in Front of Hao Xiong's Residence Did Not Explode; Assailant Arrested, Pursued, and Shot Dead. A Paper-Wrapped Bomb Also Discovered in Front of the Weida Xiang Cotton Shop

Yesterday morning, two bomb incidents occurred in the French Concession. One was in front of the residence of Hao Xiong, a comprador for Mitsui & Co. on Rue du Père Robert, and the other was in front of the Weida Xiang Cotton Shop on Ningxing Street. Hao Xiong's residence was previously bombed on the evening of June 11th, making yesterday's incident the second time. The details are as follows:

Both Bombs Thrown Failed to Explode

At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday, two men dressed in blue cloth short shirts and trousers turned from Route Frelupt into Rue du Père Robert and walked slowly northward. In front of Guangci Hospital, one of them suddenly took out a bomb from his pocket and threw it remotely across the street. It landed on the curb but did not explode. At the same time, the other man quickly walked to the diagonally opposite residence of Taro Hao, number 114, and also threw a bomb, which also did not explode. The two men then fled quickly towards Avenue Lafayette.

One Assailant Shot Dead on the Spot

A Chinese constable stationed near the residence at number 114 noticed the situation and gave chase, firing four or five shots from his handgun. At the intersection of Rue du Père Robert and Avenue Lafayette, one of the men was hit. The bullet entered the back of his head and exited his forehead. He fell to the ground and died instantly. The other man escaped without a trace. The French Concession police and the Japanese authorities were quickly notified and dispatched a large number of police officers to the scene to investigate. The bombs were taken back for inspection.

Foreign Press Reports a Simple Robbery

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury," at 8:00 AM yesterday, an Annamite constable and a Chinese bomber exchanged fire on Rue du Père Robert. The Chinese man was shot down on the spot and sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. As of the time of reporting, the Chinese man's condition remained critical. It was reported that at approximately 8:00 AM yesterday, two Chinese men, disguised as watermelon vendors, went to number 5, Lane 17, West Seymour Road and knocked on the door to sell watermelons. After the door was opened, one of the two Chinese men took out a hand grenade hidden in one of the three watermelons and threatened the occupant to hand over money. Unexpectedly, the occupant screamed loudly in fright. Fearing exposure, they fled to the intersection of West Seymour Road and Rue du Père Robert, where they encountered a Russian constable who came after hearing the screams. In order to preempt, the Chinese men took out a hand grenade from their sleeves and threw it at the constable, but it did not explode. The Russian constable returned fire, attempting to hit them, and chased them to Rue du Père Robert, where an Annamite constable arrived and assisted in opening fire. As a result, one man fell to the ground, and the other escaped. The injured man was sent to Guangci Hospital and is said to be in critical condition. The French Concession police are currently pursuing the fugitive.

Bomb Discovered in Front of Cotton Shop

At approximately 9:45 AM yesterday, a tin can hand grenade wrapped in newspaper was discovered in front of the Weida Xiang Cotton Shop at number 150 Ningxing Street in the French Concession. It was placed inside a shoe box and tied with rope. At the time, the area was the site of a small vegetable market, and there were many pedestrians, but no one noticed it. Later, a passerby discovered it and, upon opening it, realized it was a bomb. It was unknown when it was placed there. The shop, as the incident occurred in front of their door, reported it to the police, who took the bomb back to the police station for investigation. People from the shop stated that they are a legitimate business and have never engaged in illegal activities, nor have they received any threatening letters. The bomb may have been someone was carrying it and placed there in a moment of panic.

### French Concession Police Arrest Eight Robbers (Men and Women), Seize Guns, Ammunition, and Stolen Goods

Last night, French Concession police detectives, acting on information obtained during a robbery investigation, arrested eight suspects, including two women. They seized six handguns, seven boxes of ammunition (35 rounds), and stolen goods worth an estimated 4,000 yuan. Three of the suspects were arrested in a teahouse on Route Frelupt, where one handgun was seized. Another suspect and two female suspects were apprehended by detectives following them as they boarded a bus near Avenue Edward VII. The remaining two suspects were arrested in a shed on Avenue Zikawei, where five handguns were seized. The suspects confessed to committing multiple robberies in the International Settlement and the French Concession.

### Film Advertisement Fraud Case Continues Trial Yesterday

Li Songsou, a local advertising canvasser, was arrested and brought before the Special Court No. 1 on charges of fraud, accused of defrauding the Yindu Advertising Company at No. 131 Museum Road of 2,500 yuan under the pretense of securing contracts for film advertisements on stage. He was prosecuted for fraud, and the trial had already begun once. Yesterday morning, the trial continued, and both parties requested an extension to allow for negotiations on the civil aspects of the case. The court, after reviewing the circumstances, ordered a postponement for another hearing.

### Authentic Cholera: Recently Discovered Repeatedly, Now Totalling 36 Cases

Since the beginning of summer, the weather in this city has been erratic, with alternating sun and rain, and sudden shifts between cold and hot, resembling autumn. As a result, the outbreak of epidemics has become increasingly rampant. According to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, since the discovery of authentic cholera in mid-last month, a total of 36 cases have been discovered as of yesterday. The majority have been cured, with only one or two deaths. It is gradually approaching epidemic levels, causing anxiety and serious concern among the health authorities of both concessions. Other conditions such as damp fever, typhoid, gastroenteritis, and dysentery are afflicting approximately 100 patients daily.

### On the Tram

— Chen Can

The day before yesterday, around 5:30 PM, I originally intended to walk, but it was getting late, so I had no choice but to sacrifice 15 cents and hop on the Route 2 tram heading east.

After the tram turned at Avenue Haig and Carter Road, I gave a one-yuan bill to the ticket seller, who slowly put it into his pouch. "This guy is probably going to try to skim some off the top," I instinctively thought. But surprisingly, he slowly punched my ticket for 15 cents and slowly gave me the change. Today he was very polite, not at all impatient, and no longer secretly saying "Help me out" or rudely skimming money. He seemed to have truly repented and was like a devout believer in a moral rearmament movement.

The third-class carriage was empty and felt strangely lonely. I asked the ticket seller in surprise:

"Why are there so few passengers?"

The middle-aged man with a full beard just smiled slightly at me without answering. Maybe he found it hard to put into words? He seemed very leisurely, almost bored and panicky.

"The tram company doesn't care about the lives of the citizens. Another increase of 65.54%. Who wants to take the tram for short distances?" a passenger across from me interrupted. "These days, this goes up, that goes up, it's making us dizzy, so we have to be careful with our money. Honestly, if I didn't have to go so far today, I would have taken the Liangbei's #__ bus, haha!" That's right, why wasn't I doing the same!

My eyes darted around, taking a quick count of the passengers in front and behind. First class: 0, third class: 4, trailer car: 6. No wonder the ticket seller was being a "bandit with a kind heart".

The tram wearily meandered east, passing Xiejiao, Park Road, New World, Risheng Building, and Shanxi Road station after station. These places are the heart of the isolated island, and it was office closing time, but the number of passengers didn't increase. I remembered the tram company authorities' statement in the newspaper: "The decrease in passengers after the fare increase is only a temporary phenomenon based on past experience. It should gradually return to normal after a month." I started to doubt their optimistic tone.

When I got off at the Ball Field stop, I stood on the tram stop and watched the sluggish monster rumble east, silently counting the passengers again: first class: 2, third class: 5, trailer car: 8.

The standard time at the Hengdali Watch Shop door pointed to 5:57 PM, exactly when offices close, but the sidewalks on both sides were teeming with pedestrians walking at a leisurely pace.

### Bank of China Car Robbed Yesterday Morning

A Bank of China car, registration number 1323, was parked on the Bund at around 11:00 AM yesterday when three thugs suddenly brandished weapons and threatened the driver, forcing him to take them west of Shanghai. Upon reaching their destination, they drove the driver out. Although he immediately reported the incident to the Shanghai West Special Police, the car was already nowhere to be found.

### Villager Selling Cotton in Shanghai Killed by Robbers at Night

Fan Yongshun, a 41-year-old man from Yangzhou residing at No. 23, Houluh, Longhua East Street, Xixiang, was a merchant who recently traded in cotton between Shanghai and his village. At 3:00 AM on the 15th of this month, Fan carried a bale of cotton, intending to smuggle it into Shanghai for sale. While passing near Tianyaoqiao on Tianyao Road in Nanshi, he was suddenly attacked by robbers who rushed out of the darkness to rob him. When he resisted, they shot him in the back, left waist, and left hand. The robbers then fled with their loot. Fan collapsed to the ground, and his family was notified by villagers who found him in the morning. He was sent to Guangci Hospital but died at 0:30 AM yesterday due to his injuries, despite medical treatment. The hospital reported the death to the police, who transported the body to the morgue for examination and notified Fan's wife to claim the body for burial.

### Gang of Cobblers and Hoodlums Bloodshed Feud: Suspect Denies Masterminding

Last month, at the entrance of Chunyang Lane on Avenue Montauban, a feud erupted between shoemakers and hoodlums over eating doufu, resulting in the death of a hoodlum named Chen Xiaomao, who was stabbed. After receiving a report, the police dispatched detectives to the scene and arrested 30 suspects. After interrogation at the Special Court No. 1, only six were convicted of manslaughter and imprisoned, while the rest were released. Last Sunday, police from the Mixed Court arrested Zhang Dexing, the main suspect in the case, on Shanxi Road. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Division 3 of the Special Court No. 1 for prosecution. Presiding Judge Jiang conducted the interrogation. The defendant, Zhang Dexing, vehemently denied instigating the convicted assailants to commit murder, only admitting that he was invited by a colleague, Wang Jinhai, to provide support. He claimed that he fled when the fighting broke out. The court, after reviewing the circumstances, postponed the hearing for further investigation.

### Da Youyu Oil Factory Employee Robbed of Large Sum of Money

At 8:45 AM yesterday, Wang Bingwen, an employee from Ningbo at the Da Youyu Oil Factory at No. 36 West Suzhou Road, was instructed to deliver 6,000 yuan in cash to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank on Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road. However, shortly after leaving the factory, he was intercepted by four robbers who brandished a gun and threatened him, taking all the money before fleeing without a trace.

### Russian "Swallow's Nest"

The French Police have recently been strictly investigating opium and gambling in the concession. The Police received a report the other afternoon indicating that there was a house run privately by a Russian in Room 8 on the upper floor, at 1000 Avenue Joffre. It was being used for people to use opium. That night at 9:00 PM, Chinese and Western police officers were dispatched to search the premises. When they arrived, the owner of the house, Jones (transliteration), had already fled upon hearing the news. They seized only one accomplice, Yu Rongli, a Shanghainese, and one opium user, Gao Dewu (transliteration), a Russian. They also seized one set of opium paraphernalia and ten boxes of opium paste. The boxes were labeled with "Qingyun Lane, Yuyuan Road, Guohua Opium Paste Company". The person and the stolen property were taken back to the police station together, and a manhunt for the escaped principal offender has been launched in order to investigate the case further.

### Weather Report

The Zikawei Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated: Shandong is clear with light and variable winds. Here and south of Ma'anshan Island, conditions will frequently change from overcast to cloudy with localized drizzle and gentle southeasterly winds. Also, in the 24 hours prior to 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this city reached a high of 26 degrees and a low of 22.4 degrees. On the same day last year, the high was 34.6 degrees and the low was 25.0 degrees.

### YMCA Subsidizes Students; Periodic Application and Registration; Young Men and Women Can Obtain Admission Tickets

The Shanghai Student Relief Committee, organized by the Shanghai Christian Association for Young Men and Women, has achieved excellent results since it began providing financial assistance. It has been decided to continue this program in the current session. However, there are slight differences in the procedures compared to the previous session. The Shenjiang News reporter has specifically recorded the detailed methods as follows:

American Students Donate the Most

According to YMCA executive Lin Yonghou, most of the funds for the YMCA's student subsidies are donated by American students. Most of those who are subsidized are also college students, as requested by the American students. This is because most American middle schools are run by the state, and students can study for free. It is only in college that students have to pay. American students do not understand the situation in China and are not exclusively favoring college students. Moreover, those who are subsidized by the YMCA are also designated as outstanding students who have suffered from the war.

Application Procedures Slightly Different

The application procedures for this session are also slightly different from the previous session. Young men and women who wish to apply must go to the YMCA from August 1st to 3rd to obtain and fill out the application registration form. They must also prepare the following supporting documents: (1) Proof of student status from the school authorities; (2) Proof of family financial situation from the parents (the above two items should be filled out in the application form); (3) A separate letter of recommendation from a school teacher introducing the applicant's academic performance, conduct, and financial situation; (4) Two photos (one attached to the application form with the school's official seal, and the other used on the admission ticket). After receiving the admission ticket, they will participate in a general knowledge test on August 10th. As for the admission ticket, male students must pick it up from the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA within three days from August 7th to 9th, and female students must pick it up from the Women's YMCA at No. 323 Avenue Muirhead within three days from August 4th to 6th.

Conditions for Receiving Assistance

Students who wish to apply for a subsidy must also pay attention to the following: (1) The subsidized students must be students of registered universities and high schools in this city (supplementary schools are not included); (2) Students who receive subsidies from the YMCA may be assigned to appropriate volunteer work by the YMCA; (3) Subsidized students are not limited by religion or gender; (4) The subsidy amount is 100 yuan per semester for college students and 70 yuan per semester for middle school students; (5) Subsidized students must be from poor families, who have indeed suffered from the war in terms of their financial situation, and who would not be able to attend school without the YMCA's subsidy. They must also be of good character and academic standing, and enthusiastic about serving others.

### The Success and Failure of Geniuses

— Xiao Yun

Nineteen years ago, Professor Terman of Stanford University in the United States conducted intelligence tests on schoolchildren along the Pacific coast and discovered 1,500 gifted children with IQs above 150. He then studied their lives and family environments. Now, nineteen years later, these gifted children have all left school and are working in society. For the sake of studying gifted children, Dr. Terman has not relaxed his research on them for nineteen years, conducting detailed investigations into their family lives, social status, and career fields. As a result, he has reached considerable conclusions regarding the success and failure of gifted children.

He found that half of these 1,500 gifted children are ordinary in society, not much different from people with lower intelligence. He found that one-quarter of the gifted children now have good social status. Most of them are professionals, earning more money, getting promoted faster, getting along better with others, and having more fulfilling married lives. On the other hand, the remaining one-quarter of the gifted children have particularly low social status. Their family and married lives are not happy, and they are relatively unsuccessful in all aspects.

Dr. Terman investigated their childhood family lives and found that the successful geniuses came from better environments. Their parents were mostly professionals or intellectuals, their families were more financially comfortable, their lives were happier, and their habits were more orderly. As for the failed geniuses, most of them lived under the oppression of poverty in their childhood, their parents had lower levels of education, and their family lives were less fulfilling.

This important discovery significantly proves the close relationship between early childhood family environment and economic circumstances and the development of geniuses. Therefore, in order to preserve and develop a portion of geniuses, enable them to become useful citizens, and benefit humanity, we should enthusiastically support meaningful movements such as the Shenbao Scholarship Fund.

### The Core of the Problem

— Lin Gan

In this journal on the 26th of this month, there were two articles on the incident of young students emulating Arsène Lupin by "robbing the rich to help the poor": Jiang Hongjun's "The Disease of the侠盗" and Cheng Limin's "Robbing the Rich to Help the Poor." The central idea of both articles is that this incident cannot be viewed as an ordinary criminal case but should instead "grasp the core of the problem" and be treated as "a psychological illness." Therefore, "it is foolish to send patients to prison instead of taking them to a hospital," and furthermore, "this case should be handed over to a psychologist rather than a judge."

I agree with these opinions.

At the same time, I feel that this incident is not only a psychological problem but also a social problem.

To grasp the core of the problem, we must explore the root cause of this incident. I believe that the occurrence of these two young students' "robbing the rich to help the poor" is centered on the imperfections of the social system.

This society appears to young, pure students as a pitch-black entity. The relationships between people are so treacherous and terrifying. They are also people, yet on one hand there is a wealthy, extravagant life, while on the other hand there is starvation and freezing. Why are there such unequal phenomena in society? Why are there such significant differences in treatment between people?

Young people have pure hearts, and they have a strong sense of justice. They deeply feel that this treatment is unfair and that people should be equal, without class and without wealth or poverty. They deeply feel that this unfair treatment should be eradicated.

However, no one has ever told them how to reform this flawed social system or how people's encounters can be made fair.

Young people not only have a strong sense of justice but also a strong desire for knowledge. People have not told them why this is happening, but they will automatically search for and explore why!

However, the reality is too tragic. The way our society treats young people is too cruel! Not only does it not help young people understand why this unfair treatment exists, but it also destroys their desire to pursue the truth. What kind of readings does society provide to young people? "Romance Novels," "Action Stories," "Risqué Stories"… What is placed before young people is a large pile of corrupting and toxic material. No one tells them how to choose, and they are left to stumble blindly. Under the strong desire for knowledge, young people indiscriminately devour those toxic readings without any choice.

This creates "psychological illnesses" in young people, leading to incidents of "robbing the rich to help the poor." From the motivation, beginning, progression, and outcome of this incident, it can be fully proven that this opinion is correct: young people do not like to commit crimes themselves but are forced to do so by society! (In fact, isn't the deepest root of the crime like this?)

Therefore, in addition to establishing juvenile courts and studying and treating psychological illnesses, the most thorough and perfect solution is to reform the entire social system!

Eleven: Midnight Song

"Don't rush, let's talk about the apprenticeship in a few days!" Old Man Shang said with a full smile, "Little girl, let me test your capital first."

"Ah! Capital…?" Mei Bao was almost scared enough to run away.

"No, you don't understand what that means! We opera singers say 'capital' means your voice." Old Man Shang kept smiling, as amiable as he could be. "Your voice is your throat. A loud voice is good capital, and a weak or non-existent voice means you have no capital. Haha, do you understand now?"

Old Man Shang's acting style, which wouldn't get a single cheer on stage, was more than enough for a fifteen-year-old girl who was young and inexperienced.

Mei Bao was happy to see that the teacher was so friendly, so she couldn't help but smile.

Warming up the voice wasn't a complicated matter. Mei Bao had secretly sneaked to the Meng family's house for three or four mornings, hiding it from Qiu Haitang, and Old Man Shang clearly saw her capital.

"The sound is loud enough, but whether you can sing in tune, we'll have to test for a few more days!" Old Man Shang was actually completely satisfied but deliberately said so.

So Mei Bao, with a heart filled with fear of failure, tremblingly followed Old Man Shang's instructions, learning sentence by sentence with the sound of the huqin.

"It's really good, Uncle. Listen: how did she learn so well all of a sudden?" Meng's daughter-in-law couldn't help but say straightforwardly.

Old Man Shang almost wanted to chase her out. (170)

### Firefighting Gun

— Li Yi

During the Anti-Japanese War in England, many public services, such as ticket sellers on trams and buses, were replaced by women so that men could enlist in the military without worries. Even among firefighters, women participated in the service. Recently, some female firefighters in London used a newly invented firefighting gun to extinguish fires by shooting a compound from the gun. This gun is known for being economical and lightweight. When female firefighters participate in firefighting, they often wear iron helmets and face shields to avoid burns from the flames.

Recently, an engineer designed a bomb-resistant umbrella made of steel bars to protect the Panama Canal. His plan is to build a 150-foot-high steel tower with a freely rotating central part. The top of the tower would be fitted with a drum-shaped cylinder surrounded by expandable steel bars, forming an umbrella shape, hence the name "anti-aircraft steel umbrella." When enemy planes approach the canal, the operator immediately activates the movable umbrella core, and all the steel bars fully expand and rotate around the top of the tower at an astonishing speed. The protected area includes a large circle with a diameter of 500 feet. Bombs that fall into this area, encountering the rapidly rotating steel bars, will explode in mid-air or fly away, and will not be able to hit the target below 150 feet. Therefore, the surface of the river protected by the steel umbrella will not suffer any damage.

### Recent Events in the Pear Garden of the Old Capital (Part 1)

— Hui Yong

A guest came from Peiping and described in detail the recent events in the local pear garden. I have recorded them to enrich the arts and entertainment section, which I believe readers will be happy to hear.

Yu Ru's Family Suddenly Experiences Disputes

Li Yuru, a talented student of the Yu character class at the Peiping Opera School, led her graduating classmates to Shanghai this year to perform "Golden Stages". Her sweet voice and lively expressions won unanimous praise from the audience. After the term expired, she returned north with her reputation and continued to perform in theaters such as Guangde under the name "Ruyi Society," becoming a sensation. Her influence was unparalleled for a time. However, the good times did not last long. Soon, she suddenly stopped performing, and there were rumors of Ruyi Society reorganizing at the same time. According to those familiar with the inside situation, Yuru's sudden cessation of performances was actually caused by family disputes. One evening, Yuru was performing at the Guangde Theater when an old woman suddenly arrived, claiming a relationship as grandmother and granddaughter and demanding Yuru's support. After Yuru finished the play and returned home, the woman followed her to the Li residence and shouted. The next day, posters attacking Yuru and her mother were plastered all over the streets and alleys, and general public opinion was also aroused. Yuru's mother, for the sake of her daughter's reputation, ordered Yuru to temporarily stop performing on the one hand and accused Gao, the person behind the old woman, of defamation on the other. Recently, Yuru has resumed performing her masterpiece "Mandarin Duck Tears" at Guangde. Perhaps this "family dispute" has been resolved peacefully!

Song Dezhu Injured in "Butterfly and Flower"

Song Dezhu is a talented martial actress from the Peiping Opera School. After graduating, she formed a troupe to perform in Peiping and Tianjin. She previously came to Shanghai to perform at the "Golden Stages," and her appeal was not weak. Song has a beautiful appearance and a good voice, and her martial arts foundation is excellent. After forming the troupe, in addition to playing martial roles, she also played the role of Qingyi (a main female character). Her masterpiece is "Princess Tie Jing's Continuous Performance of Visiting Mother," and the complete "Yang Paifeng" also has the ability to attract audiences. She and Yan Shishan of Fushe are the most promising martial actresses at present. On the 18th of this month, Dezhu performed "Butterfly and Flower" at the Sanqing Theater. This play is very demanding in terms of singing, acting, recitation, and acrobatics. The play also includes skills such as climbing the dragon chair, which is Dezhu's unique and famous act. That evening, the audience was particularly large, and Dezhu performed with extra effort. When she performed the scene of spying in the Han Mansion, she flipped down from the half-platform. Unfortunately, due to the negligence of the "protector," she suffered a slight injury. The audience below the stage was shocked, but she still mustered up the courage to perform the subsequent scenes as usual, performing every part impeccably. The next night, she still performed "Little Shepherd" and "Spider Cave" at Sanqing to help a friend. Dezhu's perseverance is commendable.

### Lianxing Organizes the Yueming Photography Studio

— Bei Shi

Since the end of the war, the Shanghai film industry has developed to its highest point. In addition to the mass production of various companies such as Guolian, Yihua, Minhua, Guohua, Hezong, and Jinxing, there are also film stars such as Wang Xichun, Yuan Meiyun, and Gu Lanjun who are producing films at their own expense. In addition, Zhao Dan created Dafeng, and Mei Xi and Zhang Jieping created Lianxing. Everything is proof of the development of the film industry.

In this development, the most difficult problem to solve is the photography studio. Therefore, both the Meicheng and Hualian photography studios can make a profit simply by renting out their studios to other companies for filming.

For this reason, the Yueming Photography Studio has been valued by the film industry. Originally, Yueming was owned by the Ren Pengnian and Wu Lizhu couple. After the war, they went to Hong Kong to develop, and Yueming was rented out as a warehouse. It is currently being leased by a paper-cutting factory. Therefore, Guolian and Minhua had both planned to purchase Yueming, but the terms of the negotiations did not match, and the deal was never completed.

Recently, Lianxing Company purchased Yueming with swift tactics for a price of 85,000 yuan, but it is only a "shell." If the installation and repair costs are included, it will cost at least 150,000 yuan. With the addition of cameras, mercury lamps, and so on, it will probably cost 300,000 yuan after the Lianxing photography studio is successfully established.

It is said that Lianxing is preparing to perform on a large scale, and work can begin next month. At the latest, a film will be produced by the end of the year. Ma Xubang and others have been hired as basic directors, and male and female actors are being contacted separately.

In this isolated island, the establishment of Lianxing hopes to not only focus on "quantity" but also pay attention to "quality"!

### Gu Han Leaps onto the Silver Screen

— Tie Liu

Gu Han, the well-known actress who was famous for "Miss Sima" in the previous years, had news of her debut on the silver screen long ago. Since her appearances as "Princess Daizhan" in Yihua's "Wang Baochuan" and "Liu Xuangu" in Hezong's "Wen Suchen" did not materialize, she joined "Zhonglv," and Zhonglv withdrew from the Xuangong Theater. However, "Lubao" tried its best to retain her, and thus Lubao had a unique highlight. Recently, Hezong filmed an ancient costume film "Longtan Tiger Cave," in which the two female protagonists, in addition to the little bird Wang Xichun, another person is Gu Han. Gu Han's figure is also petite, so Hezong has two small birds. The preview of this film is said to have been screened in Hong Kong, and there is no confirmation when it will be seen by the audience in Shanghai.

Miss Gu Han's clear Mandarin, skilled acting, appropriate outline, and beautiful appearance all meet the requirements under the mercury lamp. In Lubao, of course, there are many opportunities to perform. Her performance in "Longtan Tiger Cave" this time is the result of the visits of Lu Jie and Zhu Shilin of Hezong as guests to Lubao once or twice. The news of her leap onto the silver screen has now been confirmed. From then on, there will be another beautiful flower on the silver screen at sea.

### "Shi Yin" One-Week Anniversary Performance

— Mingming

The "Shi Yan" (Experimental) Music Society's one-week anniversary concert has found its performance venue, which is the Russian Art Theatre at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Hude. They have been rehearsing almost every day for the past two days. Although the weather in Shanghai is so bad, with rain at any moment, there is a danger of it becoming "Venice." Because most of the choral pieces are being performed for the first time in Shanghai, it is difficult to achieve success without intensifying rehearsals. Especially operas such as "Quiet Flows the Don," "Virgin Soil Upturned," and "And Quiet Flows the Don," are still unfamiliar to many musicians, so they have to go through a difficult preparation period. Originally, they were planning to hold it at the YMCA on July 8, 9, and 13, but later, due to problems with the venue, it was changed to July 30 and August 1 at the "Russian Art Theatre," and the program was also enriched. On the choral side, "Song of Stenka Razin," "From Borderland to Borderland," and "Cossack Song" were added, while the solo performances added two very "modern" piano pieces, and Mr. Zhang was invited to sing two famous old Russian songs, "Fantasy of a Young Farmer" and "You Are an Angel."

Interestingly, "Shi Yin" also invited Mr. Ge Xin to compose a "Medley," which was sent to them. In addition to six choral pieces such as "Farmer's Wife Song" and "Fatherland Song," there are also several solo pieces, which mobilized some of "Shi Yin's" solo talents to perform, including Zhu Mei, Zhi Ying, Chen Luo, Huang Long, Wu Tong, Zhou Ze, Kun Gang, Xue Sheng, Tie Fei, and others, totaling more than ten people. We would like to introduce this concert to every young person who loves music.

Chapter Thirteen: Refusing to Lower One's Head in the Wilderness

When Liu Yining heard what Xu Jingde said, he also agreed and said with emotion, "A man's ambition lies in all directions. Since Brother Jing has such great ambitions, I am naturally willing to accompany him, and also get to know Zhang, Chen, and other worthies. These past few years, I have felt very lonely lying dormant in Mount Weifeng. Fortunately, I met Brother Jing and it was like seeing an old friend. Our aspirations are aligned, and from now on, my whereabouts will be with Brother Jing, sharing both success and failure." Xu Jing said happily, "It is difficult to find a confidant in life. We met by chance, and I am grateful for your favor, Brother, and I feel supported on this journey. What can I say? In the future, we should work together for the country and live up to this seven-foot body, and also live up to General Zhou, Uncle Wang, and other comrades who are underground. I hope you will always help me with my shortcomings." Liu Yining nodded and smiled slightly, "My heart is as clear as the bright sun that I share with Brother Jing!" Xu Jing was overjoyed. From then on, the two had settled on their goals and were just waiting for Liu Yining's aunt's burial to take place before they could set off. They talked about martial arts and important events in the world every day. In the blink of an eye, the date of the burial arrived. The old monk Zhiyuan brought many fire workers to help. The next day, Liu Yining also made some preparations, and then the fire workers carried his aunt's coffin to his uncle's tomb to dig a hole for burial. In less than half a day, everything was done. Liu Yining cried and paid his respects at the tomb before returning. The next day, he and Xu Jing went to the Guanwang Temple to thank the old monk Zhiyuan and chanted scriptures in the temple for his aunt for a day to transcend her soul. After being busy for several days, he and Xu Jing discussed and decided to set off on the fifteenth. They entrusted the huts and tombs here to the care of the old monk Zhiyuan. There was also a maidservant who needed to be arranged for, because there was a relative of the maidservant in Qijia Village at the foot of the mountain, so Liu Yining sent her down the mountain. The weather was slightly cooler that day. After lunch, Liu Yining accompanied the maidservant down the mountain. Xu Jing was taking a nap on the kang in the room when he suddenly heard the sound of wolves howling outside the door, which woke him up from his dream. He remembered that there were still two horses in the back garden, which would be useful in the future, so he quickly jumped up from the kang, took the Chifeng Treasure Sword from the wall, ran to the door, and peeked out through the crack in the door, seeing a very large wolf jumping around outside the door, seemingly wanting to jump over the wall and enter.
