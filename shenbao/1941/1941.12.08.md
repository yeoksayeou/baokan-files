### In an Effort to Save the Pacific Crisis, the US Government Makes a Final Effort

Second Private Letter Sent Directly to the Japanese Emperor, Accusing Japanese Troops of Attacking Thailand

United Press, Washington, 7th - President Roosevelt will send a private letter to the Japanese Emperor as a last effort to avoid the outbreak of war in the Pacific. The State Department announced that President Roosevelt is now sending a private letter to the Japanese Emperor, while accusing the Japanese troops and navy of actions that can be regarded as preparing to attack Thailand. This announcement was like a bolt from the blue, and its shape shows the seriousness of the government's view of the Far Eastern situation. The State Department formally announced that information obtained by Washington officials indicates that 125,000 Japanese soldiers are gathered in Vietnam, and two major heavily guarded Japanese transport fleets are heading towards the Gulf of Siam. The two transport fleets were discovered yesterday at Cape Cambodia (also known as Lan Ni Wei) at the southern tip of Vietnam. The State Department did not explain the announcement regarding President Roosevelt's letter to the Japanese Emperor, and State Department officials did not clarify the letter. The concentration of Japanese troops in Vietnam is absolutely contrary to Japan's reply to President Roosevelt's request for Japan's intentions in the Far East, as Japan claimed that this concentration was purely to deal with the concentration of Chinese troops in Yunnan Province. The State Department stated that the Japanese transport fleet heading towards the Gulf of Siam was discovered yesterday morning southeast of Cape Cambodia. Both fleets included a large number of ships and escorting warships. According to the State Department, estimates obtained by Washington indicate that there are 82,000 Japanese troops in southern Vietnam, 25,000 in northern Vietnam, and another 18,000 troops in a transport ship in Con Son. The State Department's announcement was issued after the administration studied Japan's reply to President Roosevelt. The announcement regarding the departure of the two transport fleets to the Gulf of Siam was the increasingly tense military reason in the telegrams from the Far East throughout Saturday. The State Department's message stated that this kind of troop movement could be used for sea and land attacks on Thailand. The message received by the State Department stated that Japan plans to hold a naval demonstration outside the mouth of the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, which is enough to quickly reduce any resistance from Thailand. The intelligence did not specify that an attack was actually in progress, but the impression was that the Japanese army had already made preparations, and if the headquarters gave the order, the attack could begin. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt's private letter to the Japanese Emperor concerns the threatening actions in Vietnam, which are enough to drag the entire Far East into war. In Japanese history, the Japanese army sometimes takes sudden actions without the knowledge of the Japanese Emperor. It is believed that President Roosevelt's letter stems from the desire to use all possible methods to avoid Japan causing war. This is the second time in history that President Roosevelt has written directly to the Japanese Emperor, the first time being when the US gunboat Panay was bombed by Japanese aircraft in the Yangtze River. It is believed that President Roosevelt's letter will be sent by the US ambassador in Tokyo, but the content is unknown.

Havas, Washington, 7th - The Pacific situation has reached an extremely tense juncture. According to the Army Department, dozens of military airfields and various defense projects built in Alaska are being actively carried out, regardless of all difficulties. At the same time, the Civil Aeronautics Administration is also building ten airfields in the Aleutian Islands to traverse the North Pacific to the Asian waters and become part of the Pacific defense. The US Navy has two major bases for destroyers and bombers in Dutch ports. The construction of these bases is extremely difficult, as it is during the freezing period, and the days are short and the nights are long, with only three hours of sunlight each day for several months.

Japanese Officials Offer No Comment on Government Reply for the Time Being

United Press, Tokyo, 7th - Japanese government officials yesterday refused to comment on Washington's disclosure of Japan's reply to President Roosevelt's questions regarding Japan's intentions in the Far East and the reasons for concentrating troops in Vietnam. Officials said, "We have nothing more to say than the statement made by the spokesman for the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau last week." "Nippon Dempo believes that President Roosevelt's questions are an attempt to probe Japan's true intentions. It is said that the Japanese government is currently paying 'close attention to the second step of action by the United States and has not ignored the Pacific ABCD line's mad increase in defenses in the Western Pacific'. Nippon Dempo also said, 'The Japanese government's unwavering attitude is comforting'." Recently, "Yomiuri Shimbun" prominently published a declaration by Thai Prime Minister Songgram stating that Thailand has not signed any secret military agreements with any "third country," but Thailand will fight bravely when war is unavoidable. "Mainichi Shimbun" stated that Britain has intensified its oppression of Thailand. The newspaper said, "The time when the Thai government changes its neutrality is near."

US Parties Believe Prospects for Relations Between the Two Countries are Not Optimistic

United Press, Washington, 7th - After Secretary of State Hull indicated that the Far Eastern situation has not changed, government officials continue to express pessimism about the future of US-Japan relations. Hull said that although the US government has received Japan's reply stating that Japan's garrison in Vietnam is not for the purpose of aggression, but only to resist the Chinese army concentrated on the Yunnan border, and that the number has not exceeded what is stipulated in the agreement, Secretary of State Hull still believes that the relationship between the two countries has not changed from the past due to this reply. Hull refused to criticize Japan's reply. It is believed here that any new aggressive action by Japanese troops in Vietnam will inevitably lead to the outbreak of a major war in the Far East, but Japan's reply denies that these troops will be used for the purpose of aggression. However, Japan's attitude still expresses the hope that the dangerous situation will not break out. Observers believe that if the Soviet Union is defeated in the future, or the United Kingdom is in a disadvantageous situation in Libya, Japan's attitude may change drastically. But the most important thing at the moment and the possible decision that will determine future US-Japan relations, unless the Japanese warlords in Vietnam no longer control the Tokyo government, will be Tokyo's reply to Secretary of State Hull's note on November 26, because that document will elicit the basic principles of the United States towards the Far East. According to Japanese special envoy Kurusu and Ambassador Nomura, the reply is being carefully prepared in Tokyo, and they said that the reports in newspapers about this reply are more than what has been published by their official sources. If the opinions expressed by various circles in Tokyo are now realized, Japan will inevitably be unable to accept Hull's note as the basic principle of the point of contention, and that point of contention will ultimately bring the United States and Japan to the brink of war.

US President Asks Congress to Approve Increased Supplementary Military Spending

Reuters, New York, 7th - President Roosevelt has requested the Senate to add another 70,000,000 yuan to the supplementary defense appropriation of 8,244,000,000 yuan that the House of Representatives has already approved. The funds requested by the President today include 50 million yuan specifically for the Navy Department's Bureau of Yards and Docks to construct unspecified public works, and the remainder to be used for repairing sailor barracks in Boston, investigating foreign intelligence agencies, and equipping 29 Coast Guard patrol boats to prevent magnetic mines. The Senate subcommittee has received the President's memorandum and has therefore convened a meeting yesterday to expedite its handling.

Reuters, Washington, 7th - The US Navy Department has lowered the physical standards for enlistment. Minor defects that were previously obstacles to enlistment will now be accommodated.

Reuters, Manila, 7th - Local naval authorities did not comment on the rumors circulating in New York that Japanese warships are patrolling in the area between Taiwan and northern Luzon, saying that they have not received any information about this rumor.

Japanese Offensive Could Erupt at Any Time, Washington Pays Attention to Far Eastern Situation

International News Agency, Washington, 7th - The government continued to pay attention to the special military preparations in the Far East yesterday. Authoritative sources admitted that a new Japanese aggression could erupt at any time. US-Japan negotiations are now at a standstill. Subsequent negotiation actions still depend on Japan. In his note to Japan on November 26, Secretary of State Hull reiterated his willingness to resolve the current differences on the Pacific issue based on basic principles. Tokyo must first agree to this note before negotiations can be reopened. Well-informed sources believe that Washington may receive Japan's reply in the middle of next week, but there is no indication that Tokyo is prepared to accept the conditions set by the United States. At the same time, the seven major developments that have occurred in the Far East in the past few days have caused Washington to re-enter a state of tension and alert. These seven major developments are: According to reports from various Australian radar stations, more and more Japanese army detachments are entering Vietnam; Singapore has canceled all leaves for army and navy soldiers; Philippine President Quezon has formulated an emergency plan for the Philippine government; US Far East Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General MacArthur is still consulting with President Quezon on the defense of the Philippine Islands; Singapore's new authorities strictly control non-British residents and do not allow them to leave Malaya; Japan is accelerating the evacuation of its expatriates from Hong Kong, Malaya, Borneo, and Singapore; and Australia has guaranteed assistance if the Dutch East Indies are attacked. At the same time, the Melbourne Herald reported yesterday that the Australian government "is consulting with the ABCD countries on everything in anticipation of war in the Pacific."

Reuters, Washington, 7th - Reuters special correspondent says that the public generally recognizes Japan's reply on Vietnam as a delaying tactic, intending to wait and see the results of the Soviet and Libyan wars to determine its next move. If the German army wins, Japan will advance its aggression plan. The Washington Times pointed out that the pretext in Japan's reply, saying that Japan has clearly included Thailand in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and considering all the circumstances, the Japanese are preparing to seize Thailand in the process of their conquest of Asia. However, the ABCD countries, in view of the threatening position created by Japan in Vietnam, will not slacken their preparations.

Thai Prime Minister Obtains Full Power to Prepare for All Contingencies

Reuters, Singapore, 7th - Thai Prime Minister Songgram has become the de facto dictator of Thailand because the Thai parliament passed an emergency legislation bill yesterday. According to local radio, the bill grants the Thai Prime Minister absolute full power for a period of twelve months. The Thai Prime Minister may take special steps to crack down on the Fifth Column and completely control all transportation. The Thai government issued a statement last night, asking the public to assist the government in a new plan to protect national security. Strikes are not allowed in important industries, and the actions of foreigners must be regulated.

Reuters, Bangkok, 7th - Bangkok newspapers all published Japanese Prime Minister Tojo's guarantee to the US President that the Japanese troops in Vietnam do not pose a threat to Thailand, but did not criticize it. Neutral observers said that the Thai government should continue to actively carry out its preparations and closely monitor developments in the Far East without the slightest slackening. At the same time, the general Thai public now has a tendency to temporarily forget politics and prepare to hold a three-day celebration to commemorate the ninth anniversary of the establishment of constitutional government.

Reuters, Singapore, 7th - A Reuters special correspondent claims that the situation has undoubtedly become serious after news broke that a large number of Japanese warships have passed the southern tip of Vietnam (about 300 miles from the Malay coast) and are now sailing northwest towards Bangkok. We may speculate that the recall of British naval and other soldiers on Saturday night was probably due to this. At this time, a large number of warships from countries with tense relations, such as Britain, the United States, and Japan, began to patrol and cruise in each other's areas, inevitably risking a conflagration. Local officials do not underestimate the importance of recent developments in Singapore, but believe that conflict may still be avoided and are making various efforts to prevent excessive pessimism. President Roosevelt's direct appeal to the Japanese Emperor has aroused the hope of the general public, believing that the wise advice may gain an advantage in Japan and stop the current dangerous developments in the Far East from advancing.

Democratic Countries Gather Large Armies to Prepare for Far Eastern Contingencies

Reuters, Rangoon, 7th - Rangoon responsible officials commented on the recent developments in the Far Eastern situation, saying that the Far Eastern situation has now returned to the original state of the past few decades, that is, Japan must decide between war and peace. Japan's policies and actions have led to the gathering of large armies in the Pacific region, and this army has had sufficient time to mobilize due to Japan's indecision. If Japan completes its means according to the Axis countries' habits, everyone is prepared to deal with it. They are unwilling to negotiate with Japan until it is defeated. At that time, Japan will undoubtedly fall to an insignificant position. Japan's future is currently in the hands of its people and steady leaders. They can still rise up to save the country at this last moment.

Reuters, Rangoon, 7th - According to the Amendment to the Burma National Defense Ordinance established today, the Burmese government has been empowered to conscript the manpower of the entire country to deal with any real or potential attack, or to facilitate the activities of the British army.

Reuters, Rangoon, 7th - Burmese newspapers commented on Japan's policies in the past three weeks, saying that its purpose is to find out how to continue to advance without causing war against Britain and the United States. Then Japan can break the ABCD line, and Tokyo will boldly move forward. However, the British and Americans have now realized this purpose of Japan.

Reuters, Chongqing, 7th - Semi-official sources said that Japan's reply to the US President's inquiry is tantamount to an insult to the American people, and its true intention is undoubtedly to express its unwillingness to give up aggression and to launch it when military preparations are completed. Now that Japan has completely occupied Vietnam, it is difficult for Vichy to prove anything unfavorable to Japan, and Japan's statement that the Chinese army threatened Vietnam cannot hide Japan's ambition to seize other territories.

Dutch East Indies Actively Prepares for the Pacific Situation and Will Never Slacken

Reuters, Batavia, 7th - The recent developments in Washington have not caused the Dutch East Indies to continue to adopt more ambitious plans. Although responsible spokespersons said yesterday that the various contradictory messages from Washington yesterday have confirmed the crisis in the Dutch East Indies, that is, the idea that preparations must not be slackened at the moment, but the local area still maintains a calm attitude on the surface. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies went to the countryside to spend the weekend, but still frequently contacted the authorities. Although the administrative agencies do not work on weekends, many people did not go to the mountains for rest, in case of unexpected events. Officials are still paying close attention to the Japanese air route from Palau to Portuguese Timor to prevent the Japanese from occupying Timor. If the Washington talks break down, the threats to the rear of the Dutch East Indies must be closely watched. Dutch East Indies officials are unwilling to express their opinions on the Japanese air route, nor are they willing to discuss whether the activities of Japanese seaplanes are limited to non-land sea areas, but admit that once war breaks out, this issue must be resolved urgently.

### To Cope with the Serious Situation, the United States Must Build a Two-Ocean Navy, Secretary of the Navy Knox Submits a Report to the President

United Press, Washington, 7th - Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox stated in his annual report to President Roosevelt, which was published yesterday, that the United States has encountered an extremely dangerous international situation, so that it must build a two-ocean navy to defend against possible invasions by allied countries. "Colonel Knox stated in his report that the bases obtained by the United States from the United Kingdom are essential to the protection of the Western Hemisphere." The report also stated, "The United States has become the world's largest naval power because it wants to create the largest naval expansion program in world history." He proposed a total of 325 warships, 2,059 new aircraft, and extended the naval bases in the two oceans, with the number of soldiers increasing from 162,64 to 1,13,962. Regarding joint exercises in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, Knox said, "The new joint program has been completed." He said that large fleet demonstration operations will not be carried out this year, because warships are stationed in the theater, waiting to respond to any emergency. They cannot be concentrated in one place to disrupt the war line. Knox also said that the Pacific, Atlantic, and Asian fleets have been reorganized to protect American interests.

### Japanese Warships Move Towards the Vietnamese Coast

United Press, Singapore, 7th - Local officials announced today that British reconnaissance aircraft have confirmed that many warships are moving near the Vietnamese coast. (The communique did not specify the nationality of the warships, but authoritative sources said that these warships can only be Japanese warships.)

### Personnel Changes at the Japanese Embassy in the United States

Havas, Washington, 7th - The Japanese Embassy in the United States recently announced that First Secretary Terashima and Third Secretary Takagi will be transferred to Brazil and Chile respectively. Embassy officials Inogawa and Fujiyama will be transferred back to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. In addition, three diplomats will be transferred to the embassy from Tokyo, Shanghai, and Panama respectively. There is no special significance to these personnel changes.

### Gunfire in this City This Morning

At about 4:30 this morning, gunshots suddenly came from the east of the Huangpu River. For about a quarter of an hour, black smoke rose in the sky, mixed with the sound of aircraft. Many residents were awakened from their dreams. Details were not clear as of press time.

### Red Army Situation Improves Further, Gaining the Initiative on All Fronts

The Kalinin Front Crosses the Volga River to Attack, and the German Offensive in the Mozhaisk Region is Repelled

TASS, Moscow, 7th - A special correspondent for Pravda in the central region said, "Yesterday, the severe frost of the 12th (27 degrees below zero) won the first victory. In the evening, our army discovered the corpses of German soldiers who had been frozen to death. They were not killed by Soviet bullets, but frozen to death by the severe frost." The wind was even stronger in the evening, and the fighting near Moscow was even more fierce. The war situation on the central lines is recorded as follows: In the Klin area, our army broke into Town Y, and in the connecting area, our army also occupied several villages, forcing the enemy to retreat. Our army's offensive in the north of Klin is also continuing to develop. The German army stubbornly resisted, trying to seize the initiative, but its counterattacks were repelled. The German army has increased by four divisions, including one tank division, one motorized division, and two infantry divisions. The fighting in Volokolamsk is extremely fierce. The German army even used the 106th Infantry Division and the 2nd Tank Division to participate in the battle for Point P. The intensity of the fighting can be seen from this. Yesterday, our army occupied several villages along the Volokolamsk highway. In the Mozhaisk area, the German army's repeated offensives were repelled. One battalion of infantry was encircled and annihilated in Village M. In the Naro-Fominsk area, our army won a complete victory. The German army retreated and fled, abandoning thousands of corpses and countless military equipment along the way. At this point, the German army's offensive in this area has completely failed. In the Stalinogorsk area, the Pirovo Guards Cavalry Division continued to advance, and the German army abandoned its positions and retreated south. The situation in Tula is still serious. The enemy has appeared on the Tula-Moscow highway and occupied several villages. In short, on the main money roads in the central region, our army has gained the initiative yesterday. The German army was forced to take the defensive. Our army's counterattack force is extremely strong. Even in the Volokolamsk area, our army's division of Rokossovsky has wiped out 10,224 enemies in seven days, destroyed 139 tanks, 91 artillery pieces, 139 military vehicles, and many other military equipment.

The Kalinin Soviets Launch an Offensive, Capturing Many Important Strongholds

TASS, Kalinin, 7th - In the past few days, the Kalinin front has been quiet. The activities of both sides are limited to opening scarce artillery fire and reconnaissance. The enemy is hiding from the cold in densely populated areas, trying to start an active offensive with scattered and disorganized artillery fire. On December 5, after our army advanced its positions and secretly reorganized its troops, it began a new offensive. At three o'clock in the morning, the vanguard infantry team crossed the frozen Volga River at the same time and occupied an attack base on its south bank. Fierce fighting then broke out in the Budonsaya-Popovka area. At the same time, our other teams also occupied two important locations on the south bank. At 11:00 a.m., our army occupied a position in the northwest of Kalinin and launched an offensive. An hour and a half later, a group of our army broke into the German defense line and occupied the outskirts of Village K. The army is currently engaged in a stubborn battle in the north of Kalinin. At 1:00 p.m., our army launched an offensive in the southeast of Kalinin. In the afternoon, our army occupied another important location. On the evening of December 5, our army reached the Leningrad Avenue in several locations, forcing the enemy to retreat. The enemy suffered heavy losses.

German Troops Withdraw from Taganrog, Leaving Behind a Large Number of Military Supplies and Objects

TASS, Southern Front, 7th - The 56th Army, commanded by Remizov, continued its offensive. The German army used infantry and tank teams to fight against Remizov's troops in order to preserve its military strength and resources. The enemy air force also tried to cover its retreat with concentrated strikes, but all were ineffective. Our army has reached the plains of the Taganrog Isthmus. The Don-Kuban and Terek Cossack cavalry teams came out to stop the fleeing enemy. The Germans hastily withdrew from Taganrog, leaving behind a large number of military supplies and objects. The outskirts of the city were filled with trucks. Our air force is giving the enemy a heavy blow along this road.

The Soviets Fiercely Strike Attacking German Troops in Sevastopol

TASS, Moscow, 7th - Newspapers published an article by Rear Admiral Zhukov on the defense of Sevastopol, stating that fierce fighting has been going on at the entrance to Western Sevastopol for a month, but the Germans have not made further progress. The Red Army troops and the Black Sea Fleet bravely defended, destroying the German army's manpower. In a month of war, the Germans have suffered countless thousands of casualties. The German 72nd Infantry Division suffered particularly heavy losses. According to prisoners Hoffmann and Möller, there were only fifty or sixty soldiers left in each of their transports. Typhoid fever is prevalent. The Germans have also suffered heavy losses in resources. 131 German aircraft and the largest artillery, small artillery, tanks, and armored vehicles have been destroyed. Our army built a strong defense in Sevastopol and launched brave counterattacks to exhaust the enemy. The Germans could not support it and have taken the defensive in some places. The Crimean guerrillas provided great assistance to the regular army. They engaged in sabotage work in the enemy's rear, cut off their transportation lines, destroyed their manpower, blew up their bridges, and burned their ammunition depots. All the people of Sevastopol have risen up to defend the city. The factory has reorganized its work to adapt to the needs of the war, producing various needed items.

### Tibetan Representatives to Pay Respects to Chairman Chiang

Chongqing – Tibetan representatives Lobsang Tashi and two others arrived in Chongqing yesterday and will soon pay respects to Chairman Chiang, present respectful documents and gifts from Tibet, and report on the current situation in Tibet. Since the founding of the Republic of China, this is the third time Tibet has sent representatives, the first time being in 1930 and the second in 1935. According to Lobsang Tashi, Wu Zhongxin's appointment to Tibet last year to preside over the Dalai Lama's enthronement ceremony left a very deep impression on the Tibetan people, who immediately decided to send representatives to the central government to pay respects and express gratitude. Tibet is currently peaceful. The location of the reincarnated Panchen Lama has not yet been confirmed. (7th Havas Dispatch)

### If Japan Invades Yunnan via Vietnam, Strong Resistance Will Be Met

China Implements Various Precautions in Southern Guangxi; Traffic from Longzhou to Vietnam Destroyed

Guilin – Whether Japan invades Thailand or attacks the Burma Road and the southwestern provinces of China, especially Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, will once again attract the attention of the world. There is no doubt that China will offer strong resistance. According to a foreign military observer who recently traveled to the southern border of Yunnan Province, an attack on Yunnan Province from Vietnam would be extremely difficult if any resistance is encountered, and the occurrence of such resistance is beyond doubt. Chinese military authorities are currently implementing various precautions in southern Guangxi Province. The transportation lines from Longzhou to Vietnam have been systematically destroyed. The evacuation of residents in the Nanning area is also underway. In the past few days, Japanese aircraft have been active in bombing Chinese military positions along the West River and North River fronts in northern Guangdong, with the apparent intention of dispersing the concentration of Chinese forces to prevent possible Chinese offensives that would prevent the Japanese army from retreating. Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi's remarks to foreign reporters that Chinese forces would attack Vietnam if Japan invaded Thailand and Burma are credible for some reason. It is said that British and American military observers who recently inspected the defenses of Chinese forces in the southwest provinces expressed satisfaction with China's determination to offer strong resistance should the Japanese attempt to invade Yunnan via Vietnam.

Moreover, this time, the solicitation method was completely adopted, so it can be widely popularized among the people. Even rickshaw pullers and maids are proud to buy bonds. This is not only sufficient to strengthen wartime economic strength, but also rich in propaganda and educational significance. (7th Dispatch)

Editorial

### The Mystery of Peace or War Between the US and Japan

The Japanese response to the US regarding the issue of increased troop deployments in Vietnam, delivered on the 6th of this month, is generally regarded as providing explanations that the US cannot possibly agree with or accept. At the same time, the US State Department officially announced that 125,000 Japanese troops have gathered in Vietnam, three-quarters of whom are in southern Vietnam, and that two large transport fleets are sailing towards the Gulf of Siam, planning to hold naval demonstrations there. Although the US authorities have not yet formally refuted the Japanese reply, the aforementioned news released by the State Department is tantamount to exposing the claims in the Japanese reply that the number of Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam does not exceed the number stipulated in the Franco-Japanese agreement and that the Japanese troops sent to Vietnam are to prevent the threat of Chinese troops, both of which are completely untrue. If the Japanese side intends to evade the important points and perfunctorily deal with the US in this reply, then the result is sufficient to show its lack of sincerity in the negotiations with the US, and further aggravates the stimulation to the US. Therefore, even though the Japanese side is still carefully studying the US ultimatum of the 26th of last month and has been slow to respond, no one dares to expect an optimistic future; given the fundamentally different positions of the two sides, and the imminent crisis of the confrontation of large armies, if it is said that Japan's future reply to the US will be contrary to what it is currently expressing in actions and words, and has the power to turn the tide, and can transform a bad situation into a good one at once, this is really unimaginable.

US Secretary of State Hull said yesterday when hosting the press that the US-Japan talks are expected to continue, and said that there have been no major changes in the Far East situation in the past 48 hours: optimistic views can of course believe that the US will not stop the talks abruptly because the Japanese response to the increase in troop deployments in Vietnam is not satisfactory, because the hope of a one in a million chance for the future has not been cut off. However, in fact, the current situation has deteriorated even more than before the US question was raised on the 2nd of this month. Comparing the Japanese reply with its actions in Vietnam, it is sufficient to illustrate that it is carrying out a very bad two-faced policy towards the US—using self-defense as a cover for offensive deployments—it would not be an exaggeration to say that the question was fruitless. And President Roosevelt's letter to the Japanese Emperor at this juncture is a very extraordinary move, and the last effort of the US authorities to save the Pacific crisis. In the Far East situation, where tension has reached its extreme, there will inevitably be considerable excitement. Now the content of the letter has not been disclosed, but it is not difficult to imagine; it is intended that President Roosevelt will certainly hope that Japan, with its consistent compassion, will know its way back, in order to avoid the unfortunate outbreak of the Pacific War; as for the fundamental views held by the US on this, it has been stated many times over the years, especially since the issuance of the Hull Note, and there is a final explanation in the ultimatum sent to Japan on the 26th of last month, the Japanese side must have heard it thoroughly, and whether or not Mr. Roosevelt touched on it in this letter is not important in comparison. The negotiations in Washington are already impossible to discuss further before the official reply from the Japanese side is submitted, and the Japanese reply to this ultimatum is just like what this newspaper pointed out in yesterday's editorial: hesitating between peace and war, showing that its color is fierce, and its spirit is already discouraged! However, the Japanese government is difficult to follow the usual political path to stop on the edge of the cliff due to the accumulation of difficulties, then in the helplessness, it directly appealed this problem to the Japanese Emperor, which may possibly obtain the effect that cannot be obtained through general diplomatic channels. It is expected that the original intention of President Roosevelt's letter to the Japanese Emperor this time is nothing more than this.

Judging from the current situation in Japan, it is harmful and without benefit to act willfully in this way. As for China, it is worried that it has no way to win, let alone deal with the sum of ABCD's strength in the Far East. Fiery words are only enough to increase its own false arrogance, and do nothing to remedy its scarce national strength. In the past ten years, there have also been opportunities that have benefited Japan's expansion, and the highest peak was when Britain and France were defeated on the Western Front last summer; however, since then, the situation of the axis of aggression has deteriorated day by day, and the prestige of the democratic camp has been revived. As of today, this weight has been absolutely tilted towards the anti-aggression camp. Europe and Africa are like this, and the Far East is even more so. Japan was not enough to achieve anything in the previous golden age, let alone in today's day when aggression has reached its end? However, in Japan, the development of its expansion demands is not entirely in line with the international situation. The determination to advance southward and build a "high-level national defense" were both prompted by the Nazi victory last summer. In terms of the time factor, it can only catch up with the back of the Nazi victory, and as for the completion of the configuration and preparation for action, the situation has changed completely, the Nazi prestige has become a thing of the past, and the democratic camp is also more prepared. Judging only from the situation, if it takes risks, it is difficult to achieve its purpose. However, on the other hand, the promotion of speeches and the promotion of mobilization for more than a year have internally become like riding a tiger, and retreating will be difficult to explain. This contradiction is shrouding the Japanese political situation, forming a large source of distress for the authorities. Recently, the war situation of the German army invading the Soviet Union has become more and more unfavorable, and the contingency preparations of Britain and the United States in the Far East have become stronger than before, and it is still not enough to make Japan's attitude towards the Far East crisis have a decisive impact. This is not the excessive stubbornness of some people, but the accumulation of bad results caused in the past, which cannot be done by ordinary people, and this is also not what can be expected of the current regime under the control of radical soldiers and their expeditionary soldiers. If the wishes of the United States can really be implemented, then the resolute young military leader Tojo is more suitable than anyone to make this decision. If the current Japanese authorities are unable to do so, then this letter from Roosevelt is also difficult to expect greater success.

The development of history is sometimes completely separated from the considerations and will of those involved. Whether the Pacific crisis can escape this convention is now at the final juncture, and delaying it is just in vain. It is expected that the unveiling of this mystery of peace or war will not be far away.

### US Relations with Finland, Romania, and Hungary Remain Unchanged

Canada and New Zealand Follow Mother Country in Declaring War on the Three Countries; US Navy Orders Seizure of Finnish Merchant Ships in the US

United Press, Washington, 7th – Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that although Britain declared war on Finland, Romania, and Hungary because the three allies of Germany did not stop fighting against the Soviet Union, the United States' relations with the three countries will remain unchanged. Finland's envoy to the US, Procope, recently met with Under Secretary of State Welles to discuss the relationship between Finland and the US following the emergence of a new front in Europe. Authorities here said that the US will discuss possible steps to be taken with Finland, Romania, and Hungary after Britain's declaration of war. The declaration of war by Britain does not come as a surprise here. The US is currently considering its relations with the three countries in detail, but has made no statement on what steps it will take in the near future. Some officials believe that if Germany allows it, Finland still hopes to stop attacking the Soviet Union.

Reuters, London, 7th – The deadline for the British note to Finland, Romania, and Hungary expired last night, and neither Romania nor Hungary responded. Although Finland replied, it was not satisfactory, so Britain is now at war with the three countries. According to the British note to Finland, please Finland stop the war against the Soviet Union according to its previous statement that it only wanted to recover the lost territory and had no intention of aggression.

Havas, Hungarian Capital, 6th – The US envoy to Hungary visited Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Teleki tonight to hand over the note from the British government announcing that the two countries were in a state of war.

Havas, Canadian Federal Capital, 7th – Prime Minister Mackenzie King recently said that the Canadian Federation is in a state of war with Finland, Romania, and Hungary from 4:00 PM today. The Federal government fully believes that the residents and naturalized foreigners within the territory will be able to attach themselves to the Canadian Federation and support the democratic primary period, so the government does not intend to take any measures to restrict the freedom of the expatriates of the above three countries.

Havas, New York, 7th – It is learned that the US Navy Department has recently issued an order to place all Finnish transport ships in US ports under guard for protection.

Havas, Washington, 6th – Secretary of State Hull recently told the press that the self-governing territory of New Zealand, through the US government, has already notified the governments of Finland, Hungary, and Romania, and that its content is completely in agreement with the final ultimatum sent by the British government to the governments of those countries. The US represents the self-governing territory of New Zealand in sending the note, and represents Britain in sending the final ultimatum, only as a forwarding agency.

Havas, London, 6th – It is learned that the Finnish envoy to Britain, Gripenberg, plans to leave Britain and return to his country within the next week. Gripenberg has been the envoy to Britain since 1932.

Havas, Rome, 6th – Political figures here are not surprised by Britain's declaration of war on Finland, Hungary, and Romania. It is said that this move by Britain has no impact on the current war situation. The Italian newspapers all said that the firm responses of Finland, Hungary, and Romania to Britain further prove that European countries are united in fighting against Britain.

Havas, Romanian Capital, 6th – Romania has not yet formally declared a state of war with Britain. The government will issue a bulletin tonight to explain its attitude. The radio stations and newspapers here are still holding silence on this matter, but the discussion world is very clear about the development of this matter. The general public believes that since Britain is thousands of miles away from Romania, it will not be able to invade for a while, and even if it bombs by air, it is at least impossible in winter. Informed sources said that Britain's declaration of war on Romania is only a gesture, so the Romanian government still trusts its German allies and is determined to continue to promote the axis policy.

### US Increases Relations with Middle Eastern Countries

Havas, Turkish Capital, 6th – According to political commentators here, American diplomacy in the Near East has been very active in recent weeks, seeking to strengthen political and economic relations with countries in the Near East.

Random Notes on the European War

### Germany Two Years into the War

They are still the first brave sons of this village to sacrifice for the country in the entire war. Now, the massacre in the East has made many German families deeply feel the pain of separation and death between fathers and sons, brothers, and husbands and wives. If the United States actively participates in the war, I believe it will have a very negative impact on German morale.

Germans have begun to show a sign that, regardless of who wins the war, regardless of what kind of politician succeeds Hitler, they will inevitably carry some mud and earthiness from pulling themselves out of the Nazi mire. It will not be easy to completely eliminate the traces of the anti-Semitic movement. It will also be difficult to smoothly implement democratic governance, requiring at least a considerable period. And to make Germans live in an environment where everything is stipulated by law without achievement will not be easy.

Berliners often carefully count the standing spaces on buses. The regulations state that only thirteen people are allowed to stand. If there are already thirteen people standing, even if there is plenty of space in the car to accommodate ten more, they would rather wait for the next bus.

Once, I was on a bus that suddenly stopped because of a red light ahead. A man got on from the back, and immediately a boy of about thirteen or fourteen in shorts jumped down and grabbed his clothes, saying, "This is not a bus stop, hurry back on the bus." The man initially looked at him in confusion, but seeing his serious expression, he said, "Let go quickly, or I will..." By this time, the bus was already moving, and the boy was still dragging the man. Seeing that he couldn't move him, he jumped back on the bus in the last second, looking at the passenger standing below and saying indignantly, "This is not a bus stop, this is not a bus stop."

Real news no longer "flows out" from Germany, but only "drips out." Most foreign journalists have left Germany, and those who remain feel restricted due to increasingly strict censorship. Lately, the news that drips out is even more scarce, with only a few pieces coming through every few days. Although the 118 American diplomats and consuls who recently returned home by ship were ordered by the State Department to remain silent, they still revealed the following points about the situation inside Germany:

British bombing is proving very effective, not only in Hamburg but also in Cologne. Tens of thousands of women and children have been evacuated from Hamburg, and hardly any ships can be seen in the harbor. The Cologne Cathedral stands among the ruins. The city center has been reduced to a pile of rubble. Terrified residents crowd into huge air-raid shelters under public squares at night.

Germans are increasingly anxious about the Eastern Front war. Approximately 20,000 wounded soldiers are sent back from the front lines every week (not including those killed or captured). German steel production fell to 28,150,000 tons in 1940, a decrease of 1,467,000 tons (US steel production in 1940 totaled 66,993,000 tons).

The Nazi Party's official newspaper, "The Blackshirt," published the following shocking news: "If the German war against Russia is seen as an attempt to liberate Europe from the forces of Bolshevism, this is absolutely wrong. We are not fighting Russia to preserve culture, preserve civilization, or preserve democracy, but only to preserve Germany." (The End)

### Shanghai Municipal Council Requests Authority from Consular Body, Sets Deadline for Rice Hoarders to Sell

Requests an additional clause to the Land Regulations to Thoroughly Control Prices in the City. Only Two American Ships Turn Back, Other Ships Still Head to Shanghai

At a time when the authorities of the two concessions are gradually achieving results in managing prices, British and American ships suddenly stopped sailing to Shanghai due to the tense international situation, causing the city's external transportation to feel the lack of ships. The Municipal Council has obtained foreign exchange from the Price Stabilization Fund for the import of various essential goods. In addition to deciding to ensure the existing materials in the two concessions and prohibiting the smuggling of flour and other goods out of the country, the Transportation Committee has chartered a ship from Shanghai Zengli Company and is fully utilizing the Municipal Council's priority in using third-country ships to clear cargo transport. Furthermore, to stabilize prices, they hope that merchants will sell their stockpiled goods at the fixed price.

Requesting Authority to Crack Down on Stockpiles

For example, the foreign rice stored within the concessions, regardless of quality, should all be purchased by the Municipal Council at a fixed price of 130 yuan per shi (unit of volume) and distributed to rice shops throughout the city for retail. However, due to inappropriate prices, in recent days, some merchants who only seek profit and disregard the overall situation have refused to sell their stockpiles, making the future of price management difficult. In light of this, the Municipal Council, in order to have a legal basis for managing prices and to have the power to crack down on those who refuse to sell their stockpiles, decided to add a new clause to the Land Regulations, following the precedent of the 53rd clause of the newly attached regulations promulgated last time. According to information obtained by the Dachong News Agency from foreigners yesterday, this application has been submitted to Consul General Hill. Once permission is obtained from the consular body, it can be announced to thoroughly manage prices in the city in both fundamental and superficial ways.

Two American Cargo Ships Temporarily Return

An official from the American President Lines revealed that two American cargo ships, carrying goods from the United States, originally scheduled to come to Shanghai via Honolulu and the Philippines, have now unloaded their cargo in Manila. These two ships, the Sea Witch and the American Leader, are owned by the American Pioneer Line and operated by the American President Lines. They arrived in Manila several days ago and, after unloading their cargo, will cancel their voyage to Shanghai and return directly to the United States. Other American ships originally scheduled to sail to Shanghai will not be diverted to Manila. As for the President Madison and President Harrison, which carried American troops from Shanghai at the end of last month, both have arrived in Manila. The President Harrison will remain docked there, while the President Madison will sail to Singapore and will soon return to the Philippines before heading back to the United States.

Other Ships Still Come to Shanghai as Usual

The President Lines has no indication of coming to Shanghai in the near future. The American citizens in this city who took the French ship D'Artagnan to Manila in mid-month are expected to arrive there around December 20th and may all transfer to the President Madison to return to the United States. It is also confirmed that several Panamanian ships have recently arrived in Shanghai, including the Flomar and the Bojaca. The latter, managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Shanghai with coal from Sumatra. Mail from Shanghai to the United States is expected to be carried by the D'Artagnan to Manila and then transferred to President Lines ships for transport to the United States. The French Postal Company cargo ship Chaffee, which carried the last batch of mail to the United States, left Shanghai on December 4th for Manila, with its final destination being Saigon.

Bureau Rice to Be Put on Sale Again

In order to adjust the supply of rice within the two concessions, the authorities have specifically decided that starting today, rice shops that need to purchase rice for retail can register with Liki Yoko on Sichuan Road if they are in the Public Concession. The procedures are the same as for selling Municipal Council foreign rice. If they are in the French Concession, they can register with nearby police stations. After approval, they can pay and pick up the goods. This rice is drawn from the more than 600,000 bags of foreign rice stored in the city's grain and bean rice industries. The Municipal Council's small-sized foreign rice will resume sales on the 10th of this month. Furthermore, yesterday, the authorities of the two concessions further reduced the amount sold per purchase to five sheng (eight market catties) in order to prevent the hoarding of rice. Some ignorant civilians mistakenly believed that this was a sign of a shortage of reserves within the concessions and rushed to buy rice from various rice shops, causing more congestion than usual. Several cases of carrying rice exceeding the limit were detained in one day.

Fair Distribution of Food Will Only Be Implemented When Necessary

As for the plan to search for food based on the number of people, it is still under consideration by the concession authorities and will only be carried out if the future situation deems it necessary. According to authoritative sources, there is no need to worry about a food shortage within the concessions. There is no accurate figure for the amount of grain stored within the concessions, but the recently rumored 2.2 million bags is a close approximation. The monthly consumption is about 250,000 bags. The authorities have also obtained a comprehensive plan for importing foreign rice and flour into Shanghai, and this plan has been agreed upon and assisted by the authorities of all countries. Furthermore, the Municipal Council has priority in loading any merchant ships arriving in Shanghai. The highest authorities in the concessions have also formulated concrete plans to ensure that the residents' food will continue to be supplied by the Municipal Council. Even if the Pacific War breaks out, the merchant ships leased by the Municipal Council to load supplies for the Shanghai concessions will be able to pass through in any situation. The Municipal Council's restriction on the purchase of rice to half a dou is not because the Municipal Council feels there is a shortage, but because the consumption of bureau rice exceeds what residents need, as unscrupulous individuals are still using small-scale purchases of bureau rice to hoard it.

### British Company, Xiangtai Lumber, Announces Closure

More Than a Thousand Employees Laid Off

According to Dachong News Agency, Xiangtai Lumber, a British company and the largest sawmill in this port, has temporarily suspended operations due to difficulties in sourcing and transporting timber. The factory ceased operations yesterday, and all employees, numbering over a thousand, have been laid off with compensation. The factory has been operating in Shanghai for more than thirty years. Before the war, it had branches in Fuzhou, Nanjing, Qingdao, and other places, all of which were closed after the war, resulting in significant losses. However, the prosperous business of the Shanghai headquarters was sufficient to compensate for the losses. Recently, due to the tense situation in the Far East, the Shanghai headquarters was also unable to sustain operations and closed down.

### Prohibition of Mutual Transport Between Wholesale Flour Merchants

Some Transfers Occurred Eighteen Times, How Can Flour Prices Not Rise?

The Municipal Council has completed the registration of flour stocks in this port and is now moving towards controlling individual needs. It has intensified the implementation of transport restrictions since the day before yesterday and prohibits middlemen from profiting from it. It is said that a batch of goods has been transferred through eighteen middlemen, with the final consumers paying a huge price. According to official sources, starting yesterday, those who apply to transport flour must declare their destination and will only be granted a transport permit after a strict investigation by the Municipal Council. This will prevent hoarding. In the future, the Municipal Council will only issue transport permits for transport from importers to wholesalers, or from wholesalers to retailers. Mutual transport between wholesalers will be strictly prohibited in order to reduce their profit-taking through multiple transfers and additional permit fees. It is widely believed that this measure will reduce flour prices.

### Manager of French Shipping Company Suddenly Arrested in Saigon

Vichy Claims He Leaked Confidential Information, Rumors That Several Ships Supplied Japanese Warships with Crude Oil

According to a recent visitor from Vietnam, the news of the arrest of Mr. Bascali, the manager of the French Mail Ship Company in Vietnam, in Saigon has greatly shocked Vietnam and the local shipping industry. It is rumored that Mr. Corchie, the Far East general agent of the French Mail Ship Company, set off on the Chaffee several days ago to Vietnam, where he will also serve as the manager of Vietnam.

Mr. Bascali is 45 years old and has lived in Saigon for many years with wide social connections. It is said that recently, after the Japanese army entered Vietnam, he reported in detail to the company headquarters in his home country the difficulties encountered by the French Mail Ship Company in Vietnam, which led to his detention. The reason for the arrest ordered by Vichy was that Mr. Bascali sent out confidential information in an inappropriate manner, causing the information to fall into the hands of unauthorized persons. The visitor also said that there were widespread rumors in Vietnam that a certain ship's

Senior Crew Member

had recently told a friend that he had heard Singapore Radio broadcasting that several ships sailing between Manila and Vietnam were supplying Japanese warships between Manila and Saigon with crude oil. The friend, upon hearing this, passed it on, causing the crew member to be forced to apologize.

### Labor Dispute at Shoe Stores, Negotiations Close to Agreement

Wages Increased by 150%, Business Has Already Resumed

Over 500 shoe stores on Zhejiang Road, Daxin Street, Xinza Road, and Avenue Foch in this city, employing about 6,000 workers, declared a joint strike starting at 10 a.m. the day before yesterday due to dire living conditions and unsuccessful requests for wage increases from employers. All shoe stores were unable to operate and temporarily closed. It is now learned that representatives from both labor and management have met several times, and their opinions are gradually converging. The employers have agreed to increase wages by 150%, with cloth shoes earning a profit of 4 fen per pair and leather shoes earning 1 fen per yuan. It is reported that labor representatives are collecting opinions, and it is expected that the labor dispute in this industry can be resolved satisfactorily in the near future. All shoe stores resumed business yesterday, with employers sending staff to receive customers.

### Several Foreign Firms Announce One-Shift Work System

Due to the recent reduction in economic conditions and oil supply in this city, several commercial firms in this city have announced shortened working hours in order to reduce the number of times employees go to the office each day, thereby saving gasoline. Hua Lun Foreign Firm announced that the office hours have been changed to 8:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., and on Sundays from 8:30 a.m. to noon.

Although the times are different, there is a general trend of reducing the number of times employees go to the office each day.

### A Glimpse of the Catholic Service Group's Donation of Clothes and Rice to the Poor as Christmas Gifts

— Gui

The Catholic Service Group distributed clothes and rice to nearby refugees and the poor at the Jinke Elementary School at 734 Jiaozhou Road at 2 p.m. yesterday, invited them to bread, and had performances of speeches and songs. I have participated in charitable gatherings many times, and I feel that the warmth and joy of this event is unprecedented. I will record the process as follows.

The Catholic Service Group is a social service organization organized by Catholic believers. The president is Ms. Lu Zengzuo. Her father, Mr. Lu Bohong, was the most famous Catholic in China during his lifetime and was awarded a robe and sword by the Roman Curia. Ms. Lu has just returned from a weary trip to Europe and is very capable of carrying on her predecessor's legacy and devoting herself to social services. The group always has a tradition of giving clothes to the poor every Christmas, which has never been interrupted since 1936. Yesterday, more than one hundred sets of simple clothes and several bags of rice were given. The cotton clothes were all made by the female members of the group in their spare time, so their meaning cannot be compared with ordinary clothing donations.

At 2:00 p.m., the poor, guests, and members gathered in the playground of Jinke Elementary School. Fortunately, the warm sun was in the sky. Although it was winter, there was no cold feeling. Dozens of rows of benches were placed in the playground, some for the poor to sit on, and some for the guest seats. There were old and young, women and children among the poor, and there were several blind people embellishing them with poles; they were seated in an orderly manner, just like students listening to a lecture. The clothes and rice were placed on several long tables, numbered, ready for distribution. First, Father Xu of the Catholic Leisi Church gave a speech, with many words of encouragement; then, Ms. Lu Zengzuo gave a speech, the general idea being that we should regard service as our vocation, those with money should contribute money, and those with strength should contribute strength. This year, due to soaring prices and limited economic capacity, the amount that can be donated is not much, but I hope that the work and effect next year will be ten times that of today.

After the speech, the students of Jinke Elementary School performed, including two programs of children's expressive songs and short dramas. The female student who played the poor child in the short drama had a lifelike expression and a sad singing voice. At first glance, it was almost suspected that she was one of the participating poor people. Later, Father Xu and the members of the group gave the clothes and rice one by one to the poor people present, who accepted them in order and bowed to thank them, which was very similar to the students receiving diplomas during the ceremony of graduating in a different industry. At that time, there was a poor Westerner with unkempt clothes standing on the side of the court. The group also gave him a set of cotton clothes, and he took off his hat to thank him before leaving. At that time, the members of the group distributed bread to the poor. While they were eating snacks, they listened to the songs of the male and female students. Amidst the ups and downs of the piano sound, they all showed their sincere gratitude. The situation of Catholics not distinguishing between classes, sitting together and enjoying themselves, was the first experience I had since participating in charitable gatherings.

Ms. Lu told reporters that the group will carry clothes to the poverty-stricken families in the Pudong area to visit them personally and give them to them at that time. She also said that the group's economy and manpower are insufficient, and she eagerly hopes that people from all walks of life will give them economic and spiritual sympathy and assistance so that their work can expand day by day and more poor people can be helped.

### Faculty and Students of Tongwen College Attacked in Taicang, One Dead, Three Injured, Two Escaped

On the 5th of this month, a long-distance bus from Wuxi to Shanghai was traveling from Taicang to Shanghai. At 3:50 p.m., when it arrived near Gelong Town in Taicang, several guerrillas from the area suddenly rushed to the side of the bus and ordered it to stop. At that time, the bus was carrying seven Chinese passengers and six faculty and students from Tongwen College in this port who were sent to investigate the Yutai area. At that time, all Chinese passengers were ordered to get off the bus, and then weapons were used to shoot at the bus. Four Japanese people in the bus were injured. Afterwards, the Japanese side received the news and urgently dispatched the nearby guard team to go there, but the guerrillas had already fled far away, not knowing where they went. Then the injured were sent by car to the nearby Japanese military hospital, but one of them had died due to injuries to the vital parts of the body. Afterwards, the bus on this road stopped operating that section starting on the 6th. Buses from Shanghai to Taicang only went as far as Jiading. According to an official announcement from the Japanese side yesterday, it was found that the injured in the attack were Bing Fenji (45 years old), a lecturer in the University Department of Tongwen College, who was injured in the chest, Jian Zhangsan (23 years old), a first-year student, who was seriously injured, and Kudo Shunichi (21 years old), who was injured in the left wrist. The other seriously injured person who died was named Miyagawa Seizo (21 years old), who was also a first-year student in the University Department. It is also said that Kiyono Yukio (25 years old) and Jue were hiding under the seats at the time, so they were able to escape.

### Inferior Son Coerces Father, Chops and Injures Maternal Uncle

Ling Axing, an old man and former foreman of the French Tramway Company, is seventy years old this year. He lives at No. 508 Kangti Road in the French Concession. He has a son named Ling Zengyuan, who is thirty years old this year and also worked as an interpreter at the Tramway Company. He has been unemployed for over a year due to some reason, living off his father. Unexpectedly, Zengyuan has become addicted to opium and heroin, often coercing his father for money. If he doesn't get what he wants, he resorts to violence. On the night before last, at around 10 PM, Ling asked his father for money at home. When he didn't get it, he started beating him. Ling's maternal uncle, Yu A'gen (40 years old, local, also employed in the machinery department of the French Tramway Company), stepped forward to intervene. Unexpectedly, Ling Zengyuan became enraged out of shame and suddenly slashed his maternal uncle's head with a kitchen knife, immediately injuring him and causing him to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. Fortunately, relatives arrived and apprehended Ling, while the injured man was sent to the hospital for treatment. The case will be handled after he recovers.

### Claiming to be the "Loyal Righteous National Salvation Corps," Extorting Money Under False Pretenses

In recent days, several factories, shops, residences, and individuals in the two concessions have suddenly received letters bearing the name "Loyal Righteous National Salvation Corps," stating that due to the cold weather, they are raising money for winter clothing and hoping for enthusiastic support and donations from all sectors. However, according to inquiries made by the Daguan News Agency to the relevant authorities, it is claimed that this organization is purely fabricated and is clearly a scam by treacherous individuals to extort money. Last year, a similar incident occurred in this city involving the solicitation of donations for winter clothing and慰勞金 under the name of the "Anti-Japanese衛總司令部." Many citizens were deceived, but after the central government denied the organization, the scheme was eliminated. Now, the actions of this "Loyal Righteous National Salvation Corps" are exactly the same. It is hoped that all sectors will not be fooled and suffer unnecessary losses.

All proceeds from the ticket sales will be used for winter clothing. The lottery was drawn publicly at the market yesterday afternoon at 4 PM. The winning number was 17, which was won by Ms. Zhu Qinzhu, a student from Daxia Affiliated High School.

With only one minute left in the game, Tang Zuowen scored from ten yards out, and Mengshi won 3-1.

The Final Act Begins

Ruitang's Lin Dianhua passed to Ye Yiting, but Yiguang's Tao Ziming missed. Yiting kicked the ball into the empty goal, giving Ruitang a 1-0 lead in the first half. At the start of the second half, Yiguang's Shen Jinda shot from close range. The ball hit the crossbar, bounced back, and hit Ruitang's Gu Biao's head, bouncing into the net. Yiguang gained a goal without effort. Time ran out, and the two sides drew. They are scheduled to fight again this Saturday to determine the winner.

### Traditional Teacher Lectures on "A Scientific View of Life" (1)

Yesterday's 16th Academic Lecture

Yesterday's academic lecture was the 16th session, held at the Buddhist Jingye Society. Professor Chuantong, a philosopher, lectured on "A Scientific View of Life." Chairman Zhu Xixuan gave an introductory speech, followed by Mr. Chuan's lecture, as follows:

Mr. Chuan's Topic

The previous lectures were held at the Xuangong, which is a theater used for watching plays. Today's lecture is held here, which is not a stage, but we are here to study acting. Because our daily lives are like acting in a theater of heaven and earth. But what kind of play is it, how should we act, and what is the true nature of the play? These are the questions about the view of life that I want to talk about today. "A Scientific View of Life" is to use modern scientific knowledge (including physics, chemistry, physiology, psychology, and sociology) to have a view of life. I will limit myself to the following three points: What is life all about, is it bitter or happy, and how should we deal with it? First, let's talk about

The True Nature of Life

This point can be divided into two aspects:　"What is life?" Life is the life of human beings, or it can be said to be a life with personality. And life must have a material basis, its characteristics are that it can grow, be nourished, reborn, adapt, and be inherited, etc. The raw materials of life are composed of matter, and its chemical composition includes fat, protein, water, salt, and sugar. In short, it is composed of elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur. It seeks stability in movement and movement in stability, making itself adaptable to environmental changes, seeking individual survival, and seeking the continuation of the race. This creates the characteristics of personality.　 (And the position of life in the universe) The position of people in the universe and the wonders of the world are like the stars in the sky and the sand on the beach, which cannot be counted. The earth is an extremely small grain of sand. One of the stars in the Orion Nebula has a volume 27 million times larger than the sun. And this kind of giant star, running through the sky, is like a small boat floating on the Pacific Ocean. Although it is separated from its neighboring stars by millions of miles, the smallness of the earth can be known, and the insignificance of people on the earth is even more unimaginable. But we cannot underestimate ourselves too much. How much greater are we than all the microbes and bacteria in nature?　 "From the scientific study of the true nature of life, we can see that everything in the universe is in motion, and there is a certain law of process and tendency. It differentiates from a homogeneous whole, from loosely organized to tightly organized, from concrete to abstract, to the point of exquisiteness. Human life activities in the changes of the universe can be regarded as the most differentiated, the most organized, and the most dexterous and abstract so far. This new organization must be more dexterous and refined than the original organization in order to evolve and develop.

### Where is Japan's Military Supply Line?

— By Zhongdao Qian San, Translated by Yu Guan Yi

The Economic Background of Laiqi's Mission to the U.S. The Direction of the Japanese Army's Movements When There Are No Results. This fully reveals Japan's economic distress and indicates the role of sending Laiqi to the U.S. as an envoy. At the same time, it provides a concise outline of Japan's future direction. The U.S. President questioned Japan about the reasons for the increase in Japanese troops stationed in Annam. The real answer lies in this article. — Translator's Note

The rear supply line is a military term that refers to all military roads, railways, waterways, and other transportation lines used to maintain the field army and its base. The necessary equipment, tools, and the preparation and supply of all materials needed to maintain military supplies on the supply line are the tasks of the military supply station. It is impossible to fight on an empty stomach. If the activities of the military supply station cannot fully meet military needs, even a clever war plan will have no hope of victory. The rear supply line is related to the lives of soldiers and is an important condition for combat. This article will explain where Japan's military supply station is, based on the relationship between Japan and the United States, the Sino-Japanese War, and the relationship between Japan and the South Seas.

Japanese diplomacy is influenced by its economic dependence on Britain and the United States, especially the United States, so it is always mindful of the attitude of the United States. Since August 13th, Japan has not only been fighting against China but also against Britain and the United States behind China. However, Japan's military supply station, like China's, is in the United States and Britain. Japan relies on the United States and Britain for more than 50% of its important materials, 80% of which are obtained from the United States. This means that Japan's national defense, on which its safety depends, is in the hands of the enemy. No matter how hard it tries to expand production and move materials, it is still necessary to obtain imports of materials from the United States. Although the United States' aid to China makes the Japanese gnash their teeth, they still cannot help but smile at the White House, otherwise, it would be tantamount to destroying their own military supply station with their own hands. All previous Japanese-U.S. talks, especially the current mission of Laiqi to the U.S., have been aimed at preventing a revolt in the military supply station. If these Japanese-U.S. talks fail, Japan will have to change its rear supply line.

In fact, since the United States froze funds to Japan, this route in the Pacific Ocean has completely failed. A revolt has long since broken out in Japan's military supply station: the formation of the ABCD line, the beginning of the economic attack on Japan, and the increasing strengthening of aid to China. The military supply station has already attacked the Japanese army on the front line through the war in China. Therefore, if the Japanese-U.S. talks fail, the Japanese commander will have no choice but to destroy the military supply unit behind him and also to seek his own military supply station elsewhere. But where can Japan's military supply station be?

Germany's decisive attack on the Soviet Union was also based on the reason of recapturing its military supply station behind it. If the Soviet Union could faithfully perform its duties in the military supply station and maintain the supply of food and oil to Germany normally, this war would not have happened.

China, which has been attacked by the Japanese army for more than four years, is still able to continue fighting. Its possession of the Yunnan-Burma Road, which is its rear supply line, is also a major reason. On both sides of the key bridge on the Yunnan-Burma Road, there are huge amounts of labor and repair materials piled up. It has been bombed and destroyed by the Japanese army several times but is immediately repaired. This is also based on the principle of maintaining its rear supply line. Although the effect of air strikes in modern warfare is great, it is still useless if the Japanese flag cannot be erected in the enemy's camp. The necessity of destroying China's rear supply line is self-evident. So where should Japan start?

The Yunnan-Vietnam Road is also China's rear supply line, and it has become ineffective after the Japanese army occupied Annam. The Northwest supply line is also China's military supply station, but its effectiveness has decreased since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine the future actions of the Japanese army.

However, the Yunnan-Burma Road is not only China's military supply station but also part of the British and American military supply station. The supply of more than a dozen important materials such as rubber, tin, and tungsten is also guaranteed by this road. The United States is threatening Japan from the position of the military supply station, and Japan must also confront it from the British and American military supply station. .

Japan's use of Britain and the United States as its own supply line has created a fatal wound in Japan's national defense. To overcome this fatal wound, it must establish a long-term plan. Comparing the distance between the United States and the South Seas, Japan takes 4,839 nautical miles to obtain oil from North America to Yokohama; if it is taken from the Dutch East Indies, it is only 2,600 nautical miles, which can shorten the journey by more than 30%. The shorter the distance, the shorter the transportation days, and the transportation capacity will increase relatively. If Japan imports oil from the South Seas, the one-time transportation period can be shortened by 10 to 17 days, and the annual transportation volume can be increased by about 1.9 million to 2.4 million tons. Now the Dutch East Indies has also frozen funds to Japan and is actively preparing for war against Japan. They have underestimated the strength of the Japanese army (?). They have joined the ABCD line and do not hesitate to fight against Japan. This is extremely reckless and presumptuous. (Translated from the National Defense Science column of the Japanese magazine "Kingo Diamond" on December 1st)

Talking About the Past and the Present

### A Brief History of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) on the Subject of Its Withdrawal

— Zhu Jing Qing

The news of HSBC's withdrawal of its headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore is as disturbing as the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. This vanguard of the British Empire that manages Far Eastern finance — also an organ of the headquarters — has even temporarily abandoned its nearly century-old base. Coupled with the announcement by the American-owned Chase Bank that it is temporarily suspending the protection of deposit rights, the tension of the situation can be said to have reached its peak.

HSBC and Jardine Matheson are the two major economic hubs of British operations in the Far East. HSBC, in particular, is responsible for maintaining the capital supply of all British commercial enterprises, undertaking the necessary exchange业务 for Far Eastern trade, and also using its hand to promote British Empire's capital exports to China, including economic and political loans. Since the establishment of the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, its position in assisting China's war economy has become even more prominent. Before the United States joined this semi-standard association, it was virtually the representative of the Equalization Fund in Shanghai. Even now, it has not diminished its responsibility to support 法币.

HSBC was established in 1866. It was established based on the British King's Charter, the British Companies Act, and three colonial ordinances. The first basis indicates that it has a special mission, the second basis indicates that it is a British legal entity, and the third basis indicates that it is a colonial bank. At the beginning of its establishment, there were already twenty-two banks of British origin in the Far East, the oldest of which was the still existing麥加利. However, none of these twenty-two British-based banks possessed these three qualifications. Moreover, their headquarters were mostly in London, and most of them went bankrupt in the subsequent economic panics. HSBC survived these same storms and exists to this day. In addition to the ability of its authorities, it also benefited from the importance attached to its position by the imperial government. However, a bank of such importance arose from a casual conversation at an ordinary banquet.

It was in the summer of 1864 that a few British merchants living in Hong Kong, including the founder of Jardine Matheson — a sailor of a steamship sailing between India and Guangdong — decided to open this bank in a casual conversation at a banquet, using exclusively Far Eastern British commercial capital. Two months later, on August 6 of the same year, the inaugural meeting was held, and business began on April 1 of the following year. The initial authorized capital was only 5 million Mexican silver dollars, with half of it paid up. The headquarters were in Hong Kong, and branches were established in London and Shanghai. Soon after, a branch was established in Tokyo. After opening, the bank faced many 　　打击, especially in 1875, when the Hong Kong headquarters suffered a large bad debt from a搪厂, and the London branch lost more than £171,000 in investments in Spanish government bonds and British railway company bonds. This was truly misfortune upon misfortune, and its shares fell to 30% below par in an instant, making it extremely embarrassed. Then, a thorough reorganization began, and the situation gradually improved, and capital and business began to increase relatively. Before the outbreak of the First World War, the paid-up capital had increased to HK$15 million. After the end of the European War, it increased again to HK$20 million. Although the current capital is still more than HK$20 million, the reserve has exceeded HK$111 million. The branches and sub-branches are located in more than 40 ports around the world. The net profit in the past year reached more than HK$13.9 million. As a result, its shares have always attracted the attention of stock traders. The par value is only HK$125, but the market price since 1930 has often been around HK$1,200. This is the magic of the increase in reserve funds. Only in 1935, when it was affected by the silver bull, and last year, when it was affected by Britain's participation in the war, did it fall below HK$1,000 twice. However, the price drop last year was precisely during the period of speculative fervor in Shanghai foreign stocks, so it quickly rebounded and reached HK$1,500. Entering this year, although the market atmosphere has faded, it is still at HK$1,300 to HK$1,400. This withdrawal news should have stimulated the market, but there was no trading.

The British financial hub in the Far East not only has huge political loans to China, but also extends the control network of capital to important enterprises in various places. In Shanghai alone, in terms of real estate, there are恒業, 业广, and 华懋; in terms of trust, there are Chinese Railway, Sino-British, Fu Company, and Shanghai 銀 Company; in terms of insurance, there are the Far East; in terms of warehousing, there is the公和祥; in terms of trade, there are Allen & Hanburys, Dafeng, Baosheng, Maolong, 惇信, Jardine Matheson Machines,麦边, Fuli, Biefa, and Taixing, etc.; in terms of industry, there are Jardine Matheson Textiles, Bode Woolen Yarn, Kodak Milk, Shanghai Water, etc.; the list is endless. From the fact that its current directors all hold positions as directors or managers of many commercial firms, it can be seen its influence among various enterprises, which truly deserves to be called the representative of modern financial capital.

### Wartime Commodity Common Sense: Steel and Scrap Iron

— Yu Zhi

Without steel, there is no modern civilization, and there are no modern weapons of war with such high destructive power. From bullets to shells, tanks, and warships, all must be made of steel. According to calculations by a Norwegian military commentator, the following amounts of weaponry are needed for a year of land and air offensive and defensive warfare on a front line of one thousand kilometers:

Based on this calculation, the monthly steel consumption per soldier is half a ton for the defending army and 11/20 of a ton for the attacking army, requiring six to six and a half tons per person per year. According to Soviet Marshal Molotov, the artillery firing power of a Red Army corps (i.e., three divisions) reaches sixty tons per minute. That means it reaches 3,600 tons per hour, and 10,000 tons of shells are used up in less than three hours of firing. The main raw material for shells is steel, and the raw material for all weapons is also steel. Without steel, there is no modern warfare; without steel, modern human life cannot be sustained. Not to mention anything else, just take the housewife in the family: without metal pots and pans, she cannot cook. Moreover, the manufacture of any production tool requires the use of steel. Historians say that humanity entered the Iron Age, and only then did it have today's scientific civilization. This is something that cannot be discounted in the slightest.

The raw materials for steelmaking are iron sand and scrap iron. Although the surface of scrap iron is oxidized, its quality remains unchanged. Moreover, one ton of scrap iron is more economical than two tons of iron sand rich in iron content. The importance of scrap iron can be imagined. Therefore, countries with scarce iron ore naturally have a strong need for scrap iron, especially during wartime.

The United States is the world's largest supplier of scrap iron, with an annual supply of more than 40 million tons, half for its own use and half for export. Japan is its largest customer. Now, the United States has banned the export of scrap iron to Japan, which has left Japan's military industry in a dire situation, no less than the United States' ban on oil exports to Japan.

In the past year, we have no longer seen trucks full of scrap iron on the roads. A year ago, it was a common sight. Where has this scrap iron gone? Needless to say, it has been shipped to Japan. The scrap iron recovery movement is now being carried out enthusiastically in various countries, and Japan is doing it even more thoroughly. A church removed its iron plates and steel bars from its roof, obtaining scrap iron worth 120,000 to 130,000 Japanese yen, but spent more than 400,000 Japanese yen in repair costs to replace them with bricks and tiles. This is the material for today's Tokyo street talk, used to emphasize the propaganda of collecting civilian scrap iron. Then, once the Japanese-American war begins, will the cement-steel-framed mansions and demolition workers in Shanghai also encounter different fortunes?

### Hoarding Again

— Wu Wei

The crows of the world are always the same black.

Look, people are bleeding, using their bodies as the Great Wall of the country; many ordinary people are ruined and their property reduced to ashes because of the war; yet there are still a group of unconscionable people, taking advantage of the fire to rob, fishing in troubled waters, desperately trying to get rich. Such are the unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai who hoard goods, and the hoarding cases cracked in Chengdu number nearly twenty. Where is conscience? How lamentable!

The items hoarded in Chengdu, although not as diverse as those in Shanghai, are all essential daily necessities that "take lives." Rice, vegetable oil, cloth, firewood. These are all things that everyone needs and is willing to spend a lot of money to buy. The psychology of the hoarders, originally not caring about the life and death of others, need not be elaborated on.

Among this group of hoarders, there are those (including so-called bankers and wealthy merchants), which is enough to make people's hair stand on end; and among them, there are even civil servants—staff members of the Price Adjustment Committee of the Provincial Government—which is even more heartbreaking. Knowing the law and breaking the law, the crime is doubled, and these few madmen will certainly be subject to the most severe sanctions.

The special meeting of the Military Commission decided to severely punish those who hoard for profit; all those arrested will be handed over to military courts for trial. How to deal with them in the future, the country has its own laws, and we will wait and see.

Looking around, there are still many unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai whose hearts are covered by lard, disregarding the painstaking efforts of the Municipal Council's fair price measures and the serious burden on the citizens, and are still trying their best to exploit profits. Although there is no economic inspection team organization here, everyone, for the sake of their own interests, is guarding against being attentive at any time to remedy the Municipal Council's shortcomings!

### Water and Electricity Vehicle Price Increase

— Cao Wenhai

The British merchant's sale of cars and buses company's request to increase fares was ignored by the British Concession authorities and was not implemented (only an additional law has been proposed). Unexpectedly, the French Concession Water and Electricity Company suddenly implemented a price increase on December 1st. This sudden price increase by the French Concession tram and bus company has left the general public at a loss. If it is said that rice prices are expensive, the authorities have now suppressed them to 130 yuan per picul. If it is said that fuel is scarce and prices are firm, the two authorities are now also trying to dredge the source of coal and suppress its price. Speaking of the increase in the living standards of workers, the living standards of the masses are not necessarily high. Is the Water and Electricity Company particularly different? Moreover, the company's profits are not necessarily low.

The French merchant's Water and Electricity Company has increased the price of electric lights for users to four corners per character since August, and then increased by 40% in September, to five corners and six cents per character. In October, the price was increased again to six corners per character. By November, the Water and Electricity Company announced that it would automatically reduce electricity fees, reducing each character by four cents, still at the September rate of five corners and six cents. At that time, tap water was also pushed back in the same way. Although the numbers were small, the citizens all praised the company authorities' wisdom in reading the beauty, sympathizing with the difficulties of the citizens, and reducing the heavy burden. How long has it been, and now the company brazenly disregards public opinion, claiming that expenses have not been reduced, and restored the October electricity fee, still at six corners per character. However, its water fee has secretly increased, increasing again and again, decreasing and then increasing, resembling the rise and fall of market goods. Is this the behavior that public utility agencies should have?

Every price increase by the Water and Electricity Company affects all other goods, and the trend of rising prices is terrible. In simple terms, it affects the issue of housing. For example, landlords demand that tenants increase rent due to the increase in water and electricity fees. If their wishes are not fulfilled, they are subjected to the pressure of cutting off water and electricity. If they are not careful and a fire breaks out, water can extinguish it, preventing it from spreading. If the water is cut off, they grope in the dark and cannot escape, burying themselves in the fire pit. This has been seen in news reports. The author hopes that the two Concession authorities, at this time, will consider the difficulties of the people and take good measures regarding the sudden price increase of the Water and Electricity Company, in order to meet the expectations of the public.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fifteen. "Papa, let's go busking!"

"It's their house!" She moved her body slightly and said intently, "They also fled from the north, a family of four. Besides the old lady and a middle-aged couple, there is also a daughter, maybe a year older than me. They probably arrived in Shanghai earlier than us. When they first arrived, they also had great difficulties in life because they were unfamiliar with the place. But last month, just when you were seriously injured, I often went in and out of the gate and saw that they were all dressed much more neatly, and their faces also had a lively color. Later, I heard the sound of opera singing in their room. A few days ago, the landlady here was chatting with me, and I occasionally asked about the family downstairs, and she told me everything..."

Begonia listened very intently, but at the same time coughed intermittently.

"It turns out that their surname is Han. The girl's father has always liked to listen to opera. When he was in Shandong, he often played tickets and slowly taught the girl. After fleeing to Shanghai this time, they had nowhere to go like us. Later, they met a fellow villager who taught him to play the huqin and take his daughter to the tavern every day to busk. The fee for singing a section is one yuan, but some people give two yuan. In addition to the waiters in the restaurant having to share a few pennies, they can earn seven or eight yuan on good days. I secretly listened to her singing last night, and it's really not better than me. So if we also take this path, maybe we can earn more than them! (282)

Family

### Letting a Maid Lead the Child?

— Si

In Chinese families, most of them entrust the responsibility of leading children to maids. These maids from the countryside have not received education. How can they shoulder this major responsibility? All they can teach children to do is to hit and scold people, especially the latter. When children learn to speak, they take the opportunity to deeply imprint this bad behavior in the minds of children.

The British writer H.G. Wells, who wrote "The Outline of History" and "The Shape of Things to Come," once said, "Our childhood grows up in the hands of those nannies, so it is inevitable that we will be affected by them and acquire their habits." This sentence is correct. In families in the United Kingdom and the United States, many housewives also hand over the responsibility of leading children to nannies. However, nannies in the United Kingdom and the United States still have considerable knowledge and can also teach children to do some needlework or read a few pages of books for children. Maids in China definitely do not have this kind of knowledge.

Of course, the greatest responsibility still lies with the parents. If they let the maids take care of the children and do not ask or listen, only planning for their own enjoyment, then they have not fulfilled their responsibility as parents.

There are exceptions. In families with too many children, a housewife is too busy and has to find a few helpers. In this situation, parents still cannot forget to pay attention to the upbringing of their children. If they hand it over to maids, then they must work hard to supervise them, because the creation of outstanding talents is definitely not easy.

### Are You a Good Parent?

— Li

Here are a few questions you can test. If the answer to a question is "No," you can get four points. If it is "Sometimes," you get three points. "Rarely" you get two points. "Yes" you get one point.

Do you often forget that your child is no longer three years old?

Do you talk about your child's shortcomings in front of guests? Do you often say to your child that they are lucky that you brought them into this world?

Do you prohibit your child from reading a certain book for no reason?

Do you quarrel with your husband or wife in front of your child?

Do you show disgust when your child's friends call?

Do you preach to your child?

Do you want to check your child's companions?

Do you talk to your child with a stern face?

When your child wants to study home economics or agriculture, do you insist that they study medicine?

The more points you get, the better. If the score is too low, you should change your attitude.

### Worth a Try: Making Briquettes from Shredded Newspaper

— Zhu Xun

Coal briquettes are very expensive right now, so we can soak the shredded newspaper that has been used to wrap things in water overnight, mix it with half the amount of coal briquette powder, and knead it together like broken cotton wool. Then, knead it into round lumps, about the size of a fist, and dry it in the sun. It can be used instead of coal briquettes. The firepower is very strong, it burns for a long time, and it is better than coal briquettes, because coal briquettes are mixed with mud, and self-made coal briquettes are replaced with shredded newspaper, so the effect is better. It is worth a try.

### Removing Worries

— De

Many family quarrels arise from unnecessary worries. In fact, when you are a little worried, please do not sit still, but tell your friends about your worries. At the same time, do not complain about yourself or get angry. The best way is to stand up, go for a walk outside, or find your friends. The following four steps can help you remove your worries in time.

Step 1: Collect all the facts about the things that are bothering you.

Step 2: Divide the facts into good and bad.

Step 3: Think of a plan.

Step 4: Start implementing the plan.

My Family Problems

### Unveiling of the Tenth徵文 Contest: A Wife Who Doesn't Sleep Late at Night

— Bao Ying

My family is very simple, one husband, one wife, and one child. My husband's income is enough to maintain our life. He has no bad habits or improper behavior. To be fair, he is an ideal husband. As for me? I dare to believe that I am absolutely no worse than others. Managing the home, taking care of the child, helping my husband with professional chores, what more can a man ask of his wife?

But we have a separation in our feelings. He doesn't say it, and I don't want to explain it to him. The reason is that I like to get up late at night. My habit of getting up late at night doesn't hinder him in any way. We sleep in separate beds. I get up quietly by myself, covering the lights so that they are not too bright. Then I open my favorite books to read quietly, or write a few articles as the mood strikes me. I dare to guarantee that I will never disturb him. The best proof is that my three-year-old child has never been awakened. So can you say that it is something that should not be done?

If he were a reasonable person, he should sympathize with me, because the reason why I have to get up at night is because I have no time during the day. Household chores and the noise of children make it impossible for me to have a moment to concentrate on writing and reading, so I have to save sleep time to satisfy my desires. Isn't that something worth sympathizing with? Especially as a husband, he should think about my happiness even more. Who knows him, alas, not only does he not have the slightest sympathy or pity, but he also regards this matter as my fault. He is not an old stubborn. He is an excellent young man from a brand-new university. Does he also think that women should only sew clothes and embroider pillow flowers and cannot read books and write articles? I know he thinks this way, so whenever I make a slight mistake in doing things during the day, he says in a sarcastic tone: "You are too hardworking at night, so you are not energetic during the day." He blames people's occasional mistakes on reading at night, as if there would never be the slightest mistake if they didn't read at night. Hmph! Sometimes he even says, "I know you are a writing genius, and it's a grievance to have you manage the housework!" That's even more nonsensical. Things like this are too numerous to mention.

These kinds of small disagreements may not be considered family problems at the moment, but, as time goes on, they will inevitably cause the feelings between the two sides to gradually break down. I cannot stop writing and reading, nor can I take any time other than at night to do this kind of work. If he cannot change his original intention, then the consequences are really unimaginable.

Editor's note: Writing is actually the best pastime for women, and reading is a good way for housewives to increase their knowledge. I cannot blame you for not sleeping late at night, because writing requires emotions. Therefore, the American Woman's Digest magazine once had an article advising women not to marry a husband who is engaged in writing.

Now, Mrs. Bao Ying's situation is exactly the opposite. Because she doesn't sleep late at night, it has aroused her husband's dissatisfaction. This may be due to two reasons. One is that perhaps because she is focused on writing and reading, she has neglected the spiritual adjustment between the couple. The second is perhaps due to the husband's competitive mentality. He does not want his wife to be more capable than him. Competitiveness is a common characteristic of people, and because of competitiveness, they forget the rights of others.

I think the best way is to take a moderate approach. If you want to get up at night, you may as well reduce the number of times, because the durability and happiness of marriage completely require both parties to understand each other and correct themselves. If they each go to extremes, it will definitely lead to bad results.

But never give up the spirit of progress, because Chinese culture needs to be promoted diligently.

Unveiling of the next competition: A father who is beaten and scolded by his son.

### A Week's Home-Style Menu

— Mrs. Hua Ying

Cauliflower is not something amazing at all, but in this time of soaring prices, it has become aristocratic. Yesterday someone sent me two cauliflowers, so I had a good meal, but it cost me more than two yuan. One and a half yuan for pork, one yuan and two corners for Guangdong squid. Fortunately, I have ready-made ham and mushrooms at home, so I used them as supplements. The pork was sliced, the squid was cut into strips, and they were stir-fried with ham cubes, mushroom slices, cauliflower, etc. A little water chestnut flour was added, and the taste was not bad. If shrimp meat, chicken slices, and duck slices are used instead of pork slices and squid, the taste will naturally be even more endless.

### (150) Crab-Stuffed Meat

— Draft by Wu Beiying

Preparation: Fresh Meat, Crab, Shrimp Roe Soy Sauce or Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence

Water Chestnut Flour, Cooking Wine, Sugar, Salt, Scallions, Ginger, MSG

Method: Chop the fresh meat, mix with soy sauce essence or shrimp roe soy sauce, and an appropriate amount of sugar, cooking wine, water chestnut flour, MSG, salt, etc., and mix with chopsticks. Then, wash the crab, use a small knife to pry open the crab's abdomen, stuff the mixed meat into the crab's abdomen, then put it into a bowl, add scallion knots and ginger slices, steam it until cooked, and it is ready.

### (151) Stir-fried Cabbage with Crab Roe

— Draft by Yao Kechang

Preparation: Four or Five Crabs, Cooking Wine, Tianjin Cabbage, Scallions, Ginger, Lard, Raw Oil, Salt, MSG

Method: First boil the crabs, remove the yellow meat, and mix with ginger shreds, scallion pieces, cooking wine, etc., and stir-fry with lard. Set aside. Separately wash and chop the cabbage, mix with an appropriate amount of MSG and salt, then heat oil and stir-fry. When it is cooked, spread the stir-fried crab roe on the cabbage, cover and braise for a while, and serve when it is cooked through.

It is not easy to transform one food item into many ways to eat it. Moreover, crabs are always boiled first and then the crab roe is removed, making it more difficult to change than raw chicken, duck, fish, and meat. However, the ways to eat and taste the crabs are distinguished by the various dishes they are paired with and the skill of the operation.

Ladies and gentlemen... If you want to buy "MSG", "Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence", and oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, please call "44594", and a special delivery will be made immediately, without taking any delivery fees.
