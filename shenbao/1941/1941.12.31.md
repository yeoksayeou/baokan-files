Sweden Capital, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - A report from London stated that Foreign Secretary Eden returned to London last night, accompanied by several Soviet party members who will stay in England for several weeks. Well-informed sources said that Eden is expected to report to the House of Commons on the Moscow conference this week.

Sweden Capital, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a report from London, British Foreign Secretary Eden returned to London last night, accompanied by representatives from the Soviet Trade Unions, who will discuss plans to increase munitions production with the British Trade Unions. A large crowd holding red flags and singing the Internationale welcomed them at the station. British Trade Union leader Citrine was also present. The Soviet Trade Union delegation included two women. Those welcoming Eden included Lord Privy Seal Attlee and First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander.

London, 29th (Havas) - Reuters reported that Foreign Secretary Eden, returning from Moscow, is expected to arrive here today. The Foreign Secretary held several meetings with Soviet leaders in Moscow, discussing various issues related to the conduct of the war and strongly emphasized that the Soviet Navy and Air Force will make significant contributions to the current war. Political figures here are reportedly satisfied with the timing of this bilateral meeting. It is also learned that a Soviet labor delegation, led by Shvernik, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, and Madame Nikolaeva, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, also came to the United Kingdom with Foreign Secretary Eden and will be hosted by British Trades Union Congress General Secretary Citrine.

London, 30th (Reuters) - (Relayed from Chongqing) Foreign Secretary Eden has returned here from Moscow. Foreign Secretary Eden issued a statement saying that he was extremely satisfied with the results of this trip and that its value was undoubtedly great. He was deeply moved by the hospitality of the Soviet authorities. Their conversations were frank and sincere. He was delighted to have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Stalin after an absence of six years since their meeting in 1935. Officials from the Soviet Trade Unions also came with Eden to discuss everything with British labor representatives to ensure that production in both countries can be increased to the highest possible level.

Sweden Capital, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - "Daily Telegraph" diplomatic correspondent Lennox wrote in the newspaper yesterday, commenting on Eden's talks in Moscow, that because the Soviet Union is fighting hard in the war against Germany, the Soviet Union will certainly demand an important position at future peace conferences. Other newspapers also have the same view, generally believing that Stalin will make extremely broad demands, which may include the internal affairs of China, the Middle East, and Western European countries. London political figures believe that military experts in Moscow must be discussing Germany's planned offensive in the coming spring. Stalin and Eden must have studied the countermeasures to be taken if Germany launches simultaneous attacks in Ukraine and Turkey. In this regard, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Turkey must maintain close cooperation and plan necessary measures to protect the Caucasus, the Caspian Sea, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Egypt. For this reason, the British Ambassador to Turkey and the Minister to Iran have also attended the meeting in Moscow at Eden's invitation. Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Litvinov also provided Moscow with information from the Washington conference during the Moscow meeting. Some political figures in London believe that the United Kingdom will not ask the Soviet Union to declare war on Japan in the Moscow meeting.

### Scenery of the Philippines

The Philippine Islands are located in the tropics, north of the equator, and comprise over 7,000 islands of various sizes.  The eastern coast is interrupted by mountain ranges, lacking winding bays and containing many reefs, so there are no major cities or towns along the east coast.  The islands to the southwest and nearby have good harbors capable of accommodating large ships, so large commercial ports have been built.  The Philippines have seen rapid progress in modern construction.  The iron bridge in the "upper picture" is located in Baguio, a summer resort, and is a structure connecting two mountains, making the engineering extraordinarily large. The "lower picture" shows a native dance of the Philippines.

### Strict Investigation of Factory Coal Consumption to Ensure Future Supply, Conservation Urged, North China Coal to be Shipped to Shanghai as Supplement

The Coal Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) will be able to accurately determine the current coal reserves in the International Settlement and the exact amount of coal needed here after one week from yesterday. Afterwards, it will be able to formulate concrete plans and begin consultations to ensure that Shanghai has a coal supply in the future. The SMC registers coal reserves for a period of several weeks.

General Investigation Takes a Week

Therefore, it is not easy to know the exact number of reserves.  If a factory registered ten units of coal two weeks ago, it would have already consumed part of it.  The situation is similar for other coal registrants.  The SMC is now dispatching a large number of investigators, with a deadline of today, to conduct a general investigation of the existing coal reserves of each registered factory.  It is expected that by Saturday, the SMC will know the exact number of coal reserves within the Settlement. At the same time, the SMC coal investigators are closely examining the coal needs of each factory based on its current production.  The results of the investigation are expected to determine which industries have more coal than they actually need, and which factories have coal reserves even though they are currently shut down.

Issuing as Few Transport Permits as Possible

After the SMC completes the investigation of industrial coal, it will strictly investigate the actual needs and reserves of coal merchants and private individuals at the beginning of next week.  This work is expected to be completed by Wednesday of next week. The SMC Coal Management Committee is now issuing as few coal transport permits as possible, in order to maintain the maximum coal reserves. As far as industry is concerned, coal transport permits are based only on the actual weekly needs.  Coal for household use, such as for heating, is generally reduced by half.

No Supply for Three Weeks

It has been found that in the three weeks since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the coal consumed in Shanghai has been from existing stocks that had already been transported, and the total amount has of course been greatly reduced.  For three weeks, no coal has been transported to Shanghai from elsewhere as a supplement. It is generally believed that the Japanese authorities will soon supply Shanghai with coal from North and Central China, and the SMC Coal Management Committee will be responsible for distribution.

### Increased Security on New Year's Day

Tomorrow is New Year's Day of the 31st year of the Republic of China. All businesses in the city will be closed as usual.

### More Rice and Flour Leaving Warehouses Today, Specifically for New Year's Needs, Roosevelt Warehouse Opens Today, Flour Withdrawal Permitted for One Week's Consumption

The Roosevelt Warehouse will also be opened today. Yesterday, the Rice and Grain Office issued instructions to several rice shops, designating them to withdraw rice from the Roosevelt Warehouse. The Taikoo, Long Mow, and China warehouses will also be open as usual today for rice shops to withdraw. Today, more than 4,000 bags of foreign rice are being withdrawn from the above four locations.

Urging Silver and Money Clients to Report Grain Reserves

The SMC has also notified the silver and money industry, which operates warehouses, that it cannot move the rice and grain stored by customers without a permit from the SMC. Each bank and money shop must also copy the customer's name, address, and quantity, and send it to the SMC for allocation to various rice shops to meet demand. It is said that the rice stored in these warehouses is quite abundant and sufficient to regulate the food supply of this port.

Continued Release of More Than Three Thousand Bags of Flour

The deadline for applications for flour from the SMC Flour Office was met as scheduled on the 29th. In addition to dispatching personnel to investigate the actual needs of applicants, transport permits have been issued continuously, designating withdrawal from the Fuxin No. 2 Factory, Fuxin No. 7 Factory, and Fufeng Factory. Transport permits were issued yesterday, and a total of more than 3,000 bags of flour can be withdrawn today, sufficient to meet the needs of noodle makers, biscuit makers, steamed bun makers, bread makers, and other industries for one week. In addition, it is learned that both the Rice and Grain Office and the Flour Office will be closed for the New Year on the 1st and 2nd of January, and will resume operations on January 3rd.

Foreign Rice Balance to be Returned Soon

Previously, rice shops in this city were selling foreign rice from the British companies Lekiang and Mow Tai on behalf of the SMC. At that time, in order to facilitate matters, all rice payments were made in whole numbers. It is now learned that the SMC, in order to consider the hardships of merchants, began to return the balance from the front. After the 8th of this month, the balance will be returned to a total of 418 rice shops that sold foreign rice, totaling more than 550,000 Legal Tender. All rice shops that have not yet received their balance can bring their weight tickets to the SMC office at No. 703 starting today to complete the procedures and transfer to the general ledger room for payment. It is reported that the rice shops have successively received notices from the SMC in recent days.

SMC Rice Payment Method

From now until further notice, those who purchase rice from the SMC must pay the payment in cash, approved cash checks, or cashier's checks issued by approved banks.

### Japanese Military Issues Emergency Notice

The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai has issued an emergency notice to protect the citizens, saying: If anyone improperly infringes on the body, life, or property of good and innocent citizens, regardless of their nationality, the Japanese army will severely punish the perpetrator without any hesitation. If anyone feels that their body, life, or property has been improperly infringed upon (such as being unlawfully arrested, confiscated, threatened, or intimidated), regardless of whether the perpetrator is impersonating the Japanese army, they should immediately report it to the Japanese Military Civil Affairs Inquiry Office. The Japanese army will only release those suspected of crimes when they can prove that they have not committed any crimes. If bribery is used, it will not be effective. If anyone uses the pretext of releasing someone from custody to extort bribes from the criminal suspect or their family and related persons, no matter who they are, they will be severely punished. If anyone is being extorted for bribes, they should immediately report it to the Japanese Military Civil Affairs Inquiry Office. The Japanese Military Civil Affairs Inquiry Office is located at the Hamilton Building, No. 170 Jiangxi Road, International Settlement (telephone 13183-4). Reports to the Japanese Military Civil Affairs Inquiry Office can also be accepted by the Shanghai Military Police Headquarters (No. 8 Chongming Road).

### New Tool to Maintain Traffic, Charcoal Engine, Cars and Trucks Can Be Modified

Due to the shortage of gasoline, private and public cars have been suspended, except for those that are absolutely necessary.  Car owners are mostly using public transportation and rickshaws instead. However, Asia Machinery Iron Works can modify passenger cars and freight trucks into charcoal engines to replace gasoline.  The factory owner, Mr. Bowman, said:

It is Especially Worth Promoting Today

In previous years, the method of using charcoal instead of gasoline has not been able to gain a foothold in Shanghai's transportation industry. Today, there is no choice between charcoal and gasoline. He has experience in modifying charcoal cars in the north. In Japan, charcoal cars are widely used. Around 1935, several technicians tried to build charcoal engines, but because the disadvantages outweighed the advantages, they were forced to stop working within six months. Now, due to the situation, it is no longer possible to be picky. Mr. Bowman also denied the saying that it costs a lot to modify cars to burn charcoal, and that the usual cost is higher than the black market price of gasoline. It is said that charcoal is a local product and the price is relatively low.

Modification Fee is Seven Thousand Yuan Per Car

It costs about 7,000 yuan to modify a passenger car to a charcoal engine, and it costs about 10.8 yuan to drive from Hongqiao to the Bund. On the surface, this number seems quite expensive, but for those who must use a car, this is still not expensive. For example, jewelers find it inconvenient to carry goods on foot or by public transport, and doctors and the elderly find it inconvenient to drive rickshaws. If they switch to charcoal cars, the safety and convenience they gain will be more than enough to offset the cost. The factory is speeding up its work and can modify about 50 cars per month, but due to various reasons, it cannot engage in large-scale modification.

New Year Schedule of Car Service

The current hours of operation for public buses in the International Settlement, from 7:30 AM to 6:00 PM, have been slightly adjusted. Namely, there are also several public buses running before 7:30 AM and after 6:00 PM. However, this extra operating time is no more than half an hour. This method has been implemented since Christmas Eve and will continue to be so today. There is no indication of any change at the moment. As for the rumors that the hours of operation for public buses will be restricted again at the beginning of the New Year, the bus schedules are set the day before, so it will be clear today.

Recycling Car Tires

Since the source of gasoline has been cut off and the oil reserves in Shanghai have been exhausted, the car companies and private cars in this port have stopped running and are placed on the shelf. Some car owners have had to spend a lot of effort because the empty cars take up a lot of space and cannot be placed. It is now learned that some car companies have unloaded the vehicles that have been put aside and made them into field cars for transporting goods by recycling.

### YMCA Distributes Winter Clothing

The Shanghai YMCA has observed that the weather has been cold recently, and there are many poor people and orphans who are freezing and shivering on the streets, which is very pitiful. In recent months, it has received donations from various parties. The YMCA has specially made thousands of pieces of winter clothing and distributed them by district. It is said that the method is very thoughtful.

### Various Documents for Vehicles Not Intended to be Driven Should be Returned

The SMC issued a notice yesterday, notifying car and motorcycle owners and drivers of various motor vehicles to exchange their driving licenses for the next year's driving license at the Licensing Department of the Police Station from tomorrow. According to information, commercial and private cars that are planned to be suspended next year, or whose owners do not intend to donate the next year's car license fee to the SMC, should return the car documents to the SMC. Drivers of vehicles that are suspended or drivers who do not intend to donate the next year's driving license fee should also return their driving licenses to the SMC. If these licenses are not returned, the next year's license fee will still be paid. Each car that is granted a special permit to continue driving, even if its driving permit is only valid for one month, the car owner must still donate the full car license fee for at least half a year. However, if the driving permit of these vehicles is no longer extended or the car owner is willing to return the license, the car owner still has the right to take back a portion of the car license fee.

Car Licenses are Universal

The SMC announced, "It has been agreed that private car licenses issued by this Bureau, the French Concession Public Works Bureau, or the Shanghai Special Municipal Government may be used universally within the jurisdiction of the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Municipal Government. Starting from January 1st of next year, private cars parked or staying overnight in garages in the areas outside the Shanghai Western boundary should apply for licenses from the Municipal Government Public Utilities Bureau. However, for the convenience of the owners of these cars, it has been agreed that the licenses for the first half of next year will be issued by the Municipal Government at the Tax Collection Division of this Bureau's General Office at No. 209 Jiangxi Road. Car owners should apply for the Municipal Government's license as soon as possible after January 6th of next year and return the license plate issued by this Bureau. In order to avoid the waste of gasoline caused by driving the vehicles to this Bureau, the vehicles will not be reweighed. The necessary information about the vehicles will be provided by this Bureau's records. As for the residents and their drivers in the areas outside the Shanghai Western boundary who have obtained driving licenses issued by this Bureau and the French Concession Public Works Bureau, they do not need to apply for a new driving license from the Municipal Government, but should apply to the Municipal Government for a replacement driving license for the next year and subsequent years, once a year. The replacement of this license will also be handled by the Municipal Government at the Tax Collection Division of this Bureau. Those who have already exchanged for the next year's driving license from this Bureau should immediately send it to the Central Police Station Vehicle Administration Office for cancellation and request the refund of the fee paid."

### British Ships from the Yangtze River are Towed to Shanghai

The British Yangtze River liners that were moored after the Shanghai war include the Taikoo Company's Wenzhou ship, moored in Jiujiang; the Wuhu, Wusong, and Changsha ships, moored in Hankou; and the Shashi and Xiangtan ships, originally moored in Yichang. After the Japanese army occupied the area last autumn, the two ships sailed downstream and also moored in Hankou. Jardine Matheson & Co. has the Baohe, Longhe, and Jihe ships, all moored in Hankou. There are a total of nine British ships moored on the Yangtze River. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, all of the above ships have been taken over by the Japanese Navy. The Baohe ship was towed to Shanghai on the 23rd of this month, and the Longhe ship also arrived in Shanghai from Hankou on the morning of the 29th. The two ships are now moored on the Yangshupu riverfront. The remaining ships will also be towed to Shanghai one after another in the near future.

### Customs to Close on New Year's Day, Ship Entries and Exits to Cease

Tomorrow is the new year, and the Jianghai Customs will be closed. The reporting of goods will be suspended. Therefore, ships traveling to the Yangtze River and near-sea ports will cease after customs closure. From the next day, Jianghai Customs will resume operations, and ships will enter and exit as usual.

### Nearly 30,000 Corpses Exposed This Year, Alarming Rate of Child Mortality, Hope to Establish a Poor Children's Hospital

Since the weather turned cold, the number of corpses exposed on the streets has increased sharply. On the night of the 28th, a total of 236 people were frozen to death on the roadside in the two concessions and collected by various charities, setting a new record since the beginning of winter. The mortality rate of the poor in the French Concession averages about 23 adults and 48 children per day. On the 29th, there were 62 adult corpses and 59 child corpses in the Public Concession. According to the Pushan Villa report, a total of 29,440 corpses have been collected this year, of which 20,720 were children, indicating the alarming rate of child mortality in this port. Most of the child corpses were abandoned on the roadside because their parents were unable to afford a funeral. Some sick children are abandoned even before they die because their parents cannot afford medical treatment. They are then exposed to the cold and die. By the time the corpse collection vehicle arrives, there is no hope of survival. Therefore, the staff urgently hope that the SMC will take appropriate relief measures, especially the establishment of a poor children's hospital, which is the most important task at present. There are very few hospitals of this charitable nature in Shanghai. If one can be established, it can save countless poor children, and the alarming child mortality rate can be reduced.

10,000 Refugees Will Not Be Repatriated

The Charitable Organizations Association of this port decided to suspend the winter relief due to the difficult times, which will make it impossible for the general poor and needy to survive the winter. There are still more than 5,000 refugees housed by the Refugee Association in the Refugee Camp on Dunxin Road, and more than 5,000 refugees housed by the Cilian Association and the Ciyuan Refugee Camp, totaling more than 10,000 people. The two associations have decided to continue to maintain them and will not repatriate them.

Salvation Army Continues to Raise Funds to Help the Needy

According to Mr. Walker, the leader of the Salvation Army in this port, the Salvation Army will begin its annual fundraising campaign on February 1st of next year, with a target of 200,000 yuan. He is very pleased with the enthusiastic donations from all walks of life in Shanghai to the Salvation Army's charitable work in the past few years, but he is also well aware of the current difficult environment. If the fundraising ends without reaching the original target, it is also reasonable. Mr. Walker also said that the Salvation Army's relief work has not been reduced due to the Pacific War and will continue to maintain its consistent policy until its funds are exhausted.

### Russian Chamber of Commerce to Handle Registration of Russian Businesses

From January 2nd to 16th

The Russian Emigrant Committee issued a notice the other day, stating that all Russian-owned businesses in Shanghai, whether they are shops or factories, must register with the Russian Chamber of Commerce at No. 614 Foch Road before January 16th of next year. It is said that this registration is in response to the suggestion of the relevant authorities, so that the shops or factories opened by Russian emigrants in this port can be centrally managed. The reason is that some Russian shops have been open for business for a long time without registering with the Russian Chamber of Commerce. As for most of the shops that have already registered with the Russian Chamber of Commerce, they should still register again. The Russian Emigrant Committee solemnly stated that this registration is a necessary measure to protect the rights and interests of Russian emigrants in this port, and it can be used to compile a complete list of Russian businesses in this port, so as to facilitate inquiries by the relevant authorities. The registration period is from January 2nd to January 16th of next year, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day.

### Silver and Money Industry to Close Accounts Today, Reopen on January 5th

### Embezzling Funds, Losing in Gambling, Lying About Being Kidnapped

Fan Maolin, a runner of the Sanjie Weaving Factory at No. 5, Alley 950, Beller Road, French Concession, 30 years old this year, was ordered on the 17th of this month to collect account payments from five department stores that traded with him: Kelly on Avenue Joffre, Wuma Road Huigong, Dama Road Dingfa, Avenue Albert Xinhua, and Nanjing Road Guohua. After receiving a total of 3,186 yuan, Fan took the money to the Lubao gambling house in the South City to gamble. Unexpectedly, he lost all the money. The next day, the 18th, he returned to the factory and lied to the factory owner that he had received the account payments and was about to return to the factory, but when he was walking to Rue Paul Beau, he was kidnapped by several kidnappers who put him on a pre-parked car, drove to a house on Yidingpan Road, and locked him up overnight. He was released the next day, but all the money was robbed. The factory owner believed it to be true and reported it to the French police station. Xitan Chang ordered Detective Wang Baolin to investigate and found out the truth. The day before yesterday, Fan was taken into the police station. Evidence such as Lubao gambling house meal tickets and car tickets was found on his person. He was ordered to be detained for investigation.

Xu Zhengting and He Yunpu, detectives of the Xinzha Police Station, arrested the criminals Yao Jiru, Chen Jiming, Zhao Guangguo, and Huang Jinming, all from Jiangbei. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a lawsuit according to law, saying that the defendant Yao Jiru was entrusted by the fugitive Xiao Daizi and received 500 yuan to open two shots, killing Wang. The other three defendants were also accomplices, but Xiao Daizi was also instructed by a fugitive wearing a suit, and the motive was unknown. After being questioned by the presiding judge, he ordered them to be detained pending further investigation.

Tao Hua Princess, originally named Yao Jianqiu, a 33-year-old song girl from Taicang at the Guangxi Road Tao Tao Guide Agency, was scheduled to go to Room 413 of the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road on the 11th of this month. Unexpectedly, she was murdered by a passenger that night, and the diamond jewelry worn by the woman was robbed. Later, Xu Fusheng, a Chinese detective of the Laozha Police Station, arrested Huang Chunshen, a suspect from Haimen, at No. 167, Baohuali, Lane 573, Huade Road, and sent him to the Special First Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, the case was due for continued interrogation. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, filed a lawsuit for robbery and murder, stating that the defendant confessed at the police station that he met Yao Jianqiu at the Nanjing Cafe on Avenue Edward on the afternoon of the 4th of this month and agreed to meet again at the Dadong Teahouse the next afternoon. When Ms. Yao arrived, while they were talking, someone suddenly greeted Huang. Upon closer inspection, it was Zhang Baogen and Zhang Shanliang. Zhang Baogen saw that the clothes and diamond ring worn by Ms. Yao were quite valuable, so he opened a room on the 6th and invited Ms. Yao to come to take action. There is a record of the confession presented to the court. When questioned, the defendant denied everything in court, saying that he was completely unaware of Yao Jianqiu's robbery and murder. Judge Feng ordered the case to be postponed for further investigation.

### Lack of Rice Buyers Not a Sign of Abundance, but of Inability to Purchase

Yesterday, the price of domestic rice in the market continued to fall due to abundant supply and falling production costs. It was heard that the price of early and late rice in the suburbs had dropped to 150-160 yuan. Small vendors were seen constantly moving. The market offered 340-350 packages, with thin rice immediately falling to 210-206 yuan, and early rice at 208-203 yuan, both down by about 10 yuan. Due to the decrease in thin rice, the price of domestic glutinous rice also fell by 3-5 yuan, opening at 225 yuan. Those responsible for maintaining the food supply should not consider this a sign of abundance, but rather recognize that the general public is struggling due to high prices, reaching a point of exhaustion and inability to purchase this expensive domestic rice. People rush to buy foreign rice carts for miles, hoping to get three sheng of rice, crowding and struggling, willing to endure beatings and pressure, impossible to disperse. Why not buy domestic rice to satisfy hunger? However, domestic rice is displayed in rice shops, but few customers can afford it. The contrast between domestic and foreign rice is stark, like heaven and earth. The uneven distribution of joy and sorrow in life is extreme. However, the universal method of selling foreign rice has not yet been seen. The difficulty of obtaining food is now at its worst. It is only known to scrape together the stored grain within the boundaries, without considering the opening up of sources. The future of food supply is unfortunately even worse than today, which is truly a matter of life and death for the people within the boundaries.

While the price of domestic rice is gradually falling, the price of foreign rice remains high due to transportation difficulties. A small amount of crushed rice, 300-400 bags, is being sold, priced at 128 yuan. Other Saigon rice is mainly supplied for public sale, and it is difficult to find it in the market.

### Japanese Yarn Improves, Shuangma Continues to Rise

The yarn market is as stable as ever because the trend of gold is at a horizontal level, so people's hearts are stable. At the same time, the situation of Japanese yarn is getting better and better, which makes the market more peaceful. 20-count Shuangma factory started at 1,950 yuan, and then a small number of profit-takers sold, and the situation turned weak, loosening to 1,915 yuan. Finally, it rose back to 1,925 yuan, with a transaction of about 200-300 packages, and the market continued to rise by 50 yuan. 20-count Yueqin was 2,160 yuan to 30 yuan, 20-count Lanfeng was 2,400 yuan to 2,380 yuan, 20-count Shuangdiqiu was priced at 1,780 yuan to 50 yuan, 42-count Lanfeng thread was priced at 3,850 yuan to 801 yuan, and 16-count Hongkui Xing was 1,720 yuan.

The cotton situation is gradually showing signs of recovery. Rangoon cotton is wanted at 400 yuan, but there are few sellers. Brazilian cotton military tickets are 185 yuan. It is heard that the authorities have already purchased them.

### Raw Gold Rises for Four Consecutive Days, Reaching 3,350 Yuan

Yesterday, the black market for raw gold continued to rise in price due to the strong push from gold shops and securities firms, reaching around 12,300. According to everyone's perception, the firmness is very solid. At the beginning of the morning, 20 taels were traded at 12,300 yuan per tael (10 liang). Then, a gold shop suddenly bought 5 taels from a customer at 12,400 yuan. Gold shops and securities firms then came in strongly, and retail investors also bought aggressively, so the price rose by another 800 yuan, breaking through 13,000 yuan. 10 taels were traded at 13,200 yuan. Suddenly, the bank gang sold, and the Tianjin gang and a gold shop came to sell, and there was also talk of the Hong Kong gang selling, and it immediately fell back 700 yuan to 12,500 yuan. At noon, it was bought by securities firms and gold shops, and it was raised again, finally reaching 12,850 yuan, up 750 yuan from the previous day, and it has risen rapidly for four days, for a total increase of 3,350 yuan.

### Facing the Torrent of Unemployment Head-On

— Lin Feng

The problem of unemployment has become a torrent in Shanghai today. This torrent is unprecedented in Shanghai's history because the departments and groups of people affected are simply too many. So far, we have seen these departments and groups of people already suffering the misfortune of unemployment:

First, the dockworkers who run around on the Bund every day; when the importing and exporting ships stop, they have no work to do. Secondly, the number of employees in foreign companies in Shanghai, such as those of British, American, and Dutch companies, is also considerable. Due to the control of gasoline, many chauffeurs and truck drivers have no gas to drive. Because it is difficult to purchase steel raw materials, a large number of hardware and iron factories have successively dissolved. In particular, due to the cessation of the actual sale of goods, many yarn factories and so on have also stopped work one after another... If we were to make an estimate, the number would probably be between 300,000 and 400,000.

Undoubtedly, this problem has become a concern for every Shanghai citizen.

Only by seeing the environment clearly can we decide on a course of action. Generally speaking, Shanghai's abnormal prosperity has come to an end, and now it is starting to fall rapidly like a parabola - this is simply an unstoppable fall. All that can be done now is to reduce the speed of this fall, that is, to maintain a bit of vitality.

I think these points should be noted:

First, although many manufacturers are encountering some economic difficulties, generally speaking, they will not lose money in the short term. Therefore, those who can maintain their operations should continue to do so. Otherwise, they should first consider tightening their belts, because everyone hopes that the Shanghai market will prosper one day. Therefore, those who can maintain a bit of vitality in terms of economics and technology now will be able to handle things easily in the future.

Second, if it is unavoidable to dissolve a company, such as those dissolved due to gasoline restrictions, then necessary living expenses for a reasonable period of time should be provided at the time of dissolution, so that they do not immediately become starving corpses and frozen bones. (Editor's note: Xiang Sheng, Yun Fei, and Yin Se, all three companies have already paid severance pay.)

Third, the most important thing is to work hard to suppress commodity prices. Otherwise, Shanghai will become an incredible place. Like these dockworkers without employers, who cannot receive any severance pay and cannot receive social assistance, not only will they become "a burden on Shanghai society," as the Western newspapers say, but they will also become a cause of unrest in Shanghai society!

### Those Who Come Can Still Be Pursued

— Jin Yi

Time flies quickly, and the calendar on the desk has been turned to the last page. In terms of time, a year has passed. On the journey of life, we have reached another stop. Looking back and looking ahead, on this New Year's Eve, which serves as the end of a segment, we must either settle the accounts or plan next year's budget.

This year, whether for merchants or individuals, has been an unprecedented year. Profits and losses, may not be accurately calculated on the thirteen-bead abacus, but in fact, even a penny's difference is recorded. For example, the monopolistic manipulation of speculators, the rapid advance of the real estate industry, and the abnormal development of entertainment venues, before settling the accounts, did indeed dazzle people's eyes. Tonight, the psychological abacus of each protagonist must have a considerable profit and loss figure. As for individuals, most of them are unable to cash the checks they issued last year (probably the amount of the checks was too large). In addition to shame, it can be considered extremely fortunate as long as income and expenses are limited.

However, we cannot be hopeless about the future. Losing money in business is just a tactical mistake; doing something meaningless is also a muddle-headed act of the times. As the saying goes, "Those who come can still be pursued." Before the books of this year are closed, we should not ask about profits and losses, but think about the mistakes of the past and try to make up for them. Then, starting tomorrow, perhaps it will be a year when business is booming and reaching all over the world, and wealth is flourishing in the three continents.

Sixteen - The Fire of Youth

Readers probably haven't forgotten about another protagonist in this book, Luo Xiangqi, right?

Seventeen years ago, she was separated from her lover and daughter in a situation as violent as wind and rain. At that time, she really wasn't prepared to live anymore, but Yuan Baopan wouldn't let her die, even forgetting the shame that a person should have and saying to her:

"The things of the past are as if they never happened. As long as you don't hold a grudge against me, I will treat you the same!"

Later, Yuan Shaowen secretly comforted her again, telling her that Qiuhaitang had not died, but had only suffered some minor injuries and had escaped to the south. Although Xiangqi dared not ask him how Mei Bao was, she thought that since Qiuhaitang was able to escape, she would certainly not abandon Mei Bao. This comforted her heart slightly. However, soon after, she heard that Shaowen had suddenly shot Ji Zhaoxiong with a pistol. The others in the Yuan family thought that Ji Zhaoxiong had a bad temper and offended Seventh Master; but Xiangqi was very suspicious. She was very worried that Qiuhaitang and her daughter had been killed by Ji Zhaoxiong, so Shaowen wanted to shoot him and avenge his friend. However, the difficulty was that Xiangqi herself could not go out to find out. Since Yuan Baofan brought her back to Beiping, although he had not placed her under house arrest, her movements had become very inconvenient. Every time she went out, she was always accompanied by Second Mistress, or Yuan Baofan himself walked with her, so she never had the chance to separate herself and look for Zhao Yukun and many other colleagues of Qiuhaitang.

Those few years were really hard to get through. She was like a person who had lost her soul, getting up, eating, getting dressed, and sleeping with the crowd every year; sometimes she didn't even know whether the weather was cold or warm today.

Her father and brother often sent letters, and only when she received their letters did she feel a little warmth in her heart. In particular, she was most happy when her father said in his letter that her brother's health had fully recovered and that he had opened a small silk shop in Shanghai, and that the business was going very smoothly.

### One Yuan, Five Jiao, Four Fen

— Yini

The wind is blowing, the rain is beating, and the snow is falling. The air on the sidewalk is desolate and bleak enough. Even the rickshaw pullers have temporarily put down their shafts, rubbing their hands, and walking into the steamy little restaurant.

It's dinnertime, and the waiter in the small restaurant, straightening his throat, shouts loudly "Blood soup, tofu..." or "Mr. Yang (referring to a friend wearing a suit) bill two yuan and five fen."

Amidst the shouting, suddenly a friend wearing a gray cloth robe was punched and kicked by the waiter. This friend silently covered his head and slipped out. Everyone focused their attention on this beaten friend, but because everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, no one went to defend him.

Later, from the "mouth" of a very fierce waiter who was asked by a nosy person, he heard this sentence:

"Damn it, he looks decent, but he can't even pay one yuan, five jiao, four fen. He ate three bowls of white rice and three pieces of salted meat for nothing. Who else should I hit but this kind of guy?"

One yuan, five jiao, four fen, the price is a punch and a kick. Everyone lowered their heads and sighed.

### A Chronicle of Major Events in the Art World Over the Past Year (Part 2)

— Jing Yi

In terms of drama:

(A) The progress of the drama movement: This year, the drama movement has been progressing at all times. Last year, there were only one or two formal theaters in the city, such as the "Shanghai Drama Society" and the Xuan Gong Theater. However, due to the urgent needs of the general audience, several more have emerged this year. They are also carefully and meticulously considering the selection of materials, the layout of costumes and props, and are gradually approaching perfection. Even theaters such as "Lubao" and "Dongfang," which specialize in performing civilized plays, have also entered the right track in order to avoid being eliminated by the audience. Recently, they have also given us many meaningful works to see, which is indeed a good phenomenon in the theater world this year and is worthy of praise.

(B) The rise of amateur drama clubs: With the development of professional theater troupes, amateur drama clubs have also been organized by a group of film actors and young men and women who love drama. Statistics show that there are no less than thirty or forty of them. Almost every week, they take turns giving public performances everywhere, occupying one aspect of the theater world. As for the general results of the performances, many of them are no less inferior to professional theater troupes. However, because they do not take this as a career, they often appear only once or twice and then disappear into thin air, and there are not a few of them.

(C) The dissolution of the two major theater troupes: In the last month of this year, an unfortunate change occurred in the theater world, that is, due to the influence of the January 28th situation, the "Shanghai Professional Theater Troupe" and the "Shanghai Drama Society," which had the greatest appeal in this city, dissolved one after another. We cannot deny that the progress of Shanghai drama to this day is largely due to the efforts of the members of these two theater troupes. This sudden loss is deeply regretted by the audience who love drama.

### Recent News from the Art World

— Yi

The Shanghai Drama School has signed a contract with the Gengxin Stage and will perform at the stage's daytime performances starting from the first day of the new year. Guan Hongbin will be the stage director. The school's newly arranged plays, "Hongqiao Giving Pearls" and "Lion Building," are also scheduled to be performed in the new year.

This column previously reported that the Datong actor Gong Jianong was at a crossroads. It is now known that Gong was introduced by Fei Mu at the beginning of the month and joined Minhua, and was assigned to play a military role in the new film "National Colors and Heavenly Fragrance."

It is rumored that the second cartoon feature film "The Bee Queen" of the National Federation has been aborted because the total cost of the film is estimated to be about 400,000 yuan. The authorities decided to stop the work of the cartoon department, and all the students in the department have been dismissed.

### Asian Theater Company's Rotation Screening System

The four first-run theaters of the Asian Theater Company, Majestic, Grand Cathay, Nanjing, and Cathay, will adopt a rotation screening system for the films screened from the first day of the new year. For example, Nanjing will screen the colorful blockbuster "Mermaid" starring Dolores del Río starting from the first day of the year. On the fourth, Grand Cathay will screen it. Grand Cathay will screen it until the seventh, and Cathay will screen it from the eighth to the eleventh, and then Majestic will take over. This rotation screening will not only adjust the audience's taste, but also reduce the inconvenience caused by traffic problems, because the audience can buy tickets and watch movies at the nearby theater.

Chapter Twenty: Wax Candles Welcome on the Battlefield

Xu Jing interjected and said, "I also think so. He didn't really want to fight the bandits for the country, but for the sake of his beloved concubine. He himself didn't have the courage. He wanted to take advantage of others, but he didn't want others to take advantage of him. The incompetent man ruins the country. How could he have the loyalty and bravery of General Zhou Yuji?" Xu Jing said this, and his righteousness was expressed in his face. Liu Wenyuan said coldly, "I wanted you to abandon him long ago. We had already left, but Chai Youji chased us back. Now that Beijing has been recovered, let's see what great things he can do? He will only get back Yuan Yuan, which is his own joy, and has nothing to do with the people of the world. Hmph! This kind of person who occupies a high position and does nothing, is ignorant of righteousness, and has a narrow vision, how can he build anything? If we continue to follow him, we will be scolded by others in the future. If you brothers can follow Youji's wishes and not leave, I can't stay for a day, and I will have to live up to your kindness." Xu Jing stood up and said, "At this time, not to mention that Brother Liu is leaving, I will also abandon him. Zhang and Chen brothers must have no reason to stay. Let's go." Zhang Cangqiu widened his eyes and said to the three people, "Let's just leave like this, and make that guy cheaper. Let's see how long that guy can be safe? We four brothers are all manly men, let's go to other places to make contributions and make a name for ourselves." Chen Fei said, "General Zuo Liangyu is guarding Wuchang, and he is also a hero. We might as well go there and try it. I also have a friend surnamed You under General Zuo, and we can go find him." Zhang Cangqiu said, "That's good too." Xu Jing and Liu Wenying had no objection. Because Chai Ying was very favored by Wu Sangui under Wu Sangui, and his attitude had gradually changed recently, and he was greedy for wealth and glory, they did not go to inform him, so as not to hinder him. Everyone secretly packed their things, and in a clear morning, carrying their luggage, they each rode their mounts, and quietly left the military camp, left Beijing City, and headed south. In the end, they abandoned Wu Sangui and left. The four people accidentally turned their heads on their horses and saw the outline of the towering and majestic capital city, and a burst of disappointment rose in their hearts.
