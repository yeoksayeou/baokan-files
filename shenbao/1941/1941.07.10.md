### German Forces Fiercely Attack Stalin's Defense Line, Soviet Forces Launch Powerful Counterattack, Tank Battle Breaks Out in Belarus Region, German Forces Attempt to Invade Kiev and Leningrad Are Contained

Reuters, London, 9th - The Soviet Union recently announced that the Red Army had defeated the German mechanized forces in the Liber area northeast of Minsk. The German advances towards Leningrad and Kiev seem to have been contained by the Soviet counterattack. The Soviet forces in the Novograd-Volynsky regions south of the Pripet Marshes are still trying to stop the German offensive towards Kiev. Fierce fighting continues in the Bakovichi region. On the evening of Tuesday, the Soviet Union shot down 62 enemy planes and lost 7 of its own.

Associated Press, Berlin, 9th - German forces and assault teams fiercely attacked the Soviet Stalin defense line yesterday. The German side pointed out that this huge battle is a decisive battle for the overall situation. The Soviet Supreme Command has concentrated all available reserve forces to defend the front line, so the fierceness of the battle is unprecedented. The Soviet resistance is extremely fierce. The most intense German offensive is between Lusk and Kiev and along the Dnieper River. The German News Agency said that after 15 hours of general offensive, the German army penetrated the Soviet defense line in the northern front and captured elite Asian troops in the Soviet army. It is now pursuing the Soviet army along the entire eastern front. Since July 2, it has captured 142,000 Soviet soldiers. Although the Red Army's resistance is firm, the German and Romanian coalition forces still captured many fortresses after a fierce attack, and seized 584 tanks, 550 artillery pieces, and several armored vehicles.

Associated Press, Moscow, 9th - Moscow Radio broadcast last night that the Red Army launched an overwhelming counterattack against the German armored forces yesterday, recovering some lost ground. The radio station broadcast an official communique stating that the Soviet army carried out a powerful counterattack at various strongholds on the front line all day long. The communique stated that as a result of the attacks by Soviet Russian artillery, aircraft and tanks in the Ostrov area of the northern front, the German army suffered heavy losses.

Associated Press, Moscow, 9th - "Izvestia" reported yesterday that Soviet artillery and machine guns completely annihilated a regiment of the Romanian Royal Guard in fierce border battles, with only four farmers from the regiment surrendering and surviving. According to yesterday's official communique, Soviet troops fought desperately and launched counterattacks at various strongholds on the 1,500-mile front. Two regiments of German infiltrators were annihilated near Bobruisk, and two regiments of German troops were annihilated near the border between Ukraine and Bessarabia. Near Ostrov, south of Lake Peipus on the Estonian border, and in the Leningrad war zone, Polotsk in northern Belarus, Liber in the south, Bobruisk southeast of Minsk, Novograd-Volynsky in northern Ukraine, and Machilev on the border between Ukraine and Bessarabia, fierce battles were reported to have taken place.

Associated Press, London, 9th - Berlin Radio quoted the official German News Agency as saying that German troops had occupied Ostrov, Berno, and Feling today.

### Germany Uses Secret Weapons to Break Through Stalin's Defense Line

International News Agency, Berlin, 9th - Military circles reported last night that the German army used a new type of secret weapon to bomb and destroy the extremely strong defensive works of the Stalin defense line and break through the Soviet main fortress, and captured 142,000 Soviet soldiers. This new weapon is a secret machine. With its great power, even the strongest reinforced concrete defensive works of modern times will be reduced to powder. It is said that the German army and the elite Soviet army fought fiercely for 15 hours and finally broke through the northern area of the Stalin defense line. On July 2 and 5, another 584 tanks and 550 heavy artillery pieces were captured. German military authorities said that due to strategic reasons, the details of the German offensive could not be fully disclosed.

International News Agency, Berlin, 9th - It is rumored that the elite German army, with the help of a "secret engine," has broken through the Stalin defense line and is now gradually expanding the gap in the Soviet fortress. The German elite engineering corps, including chemical warfare experts, has used secret weapons to split the Stalin defense line because the Red Army's resistance is fierce. The German High Command said that although a large number of Red Army reserve soldiers resisted fiercely, these gaps are now expanding non-stop. It is said that the rupture is in the northern area, and the German army fought fiercely with the elite Soviet army for 15 hours, including the famous Asian special elite troops.

### Red Army is Advantageous in a Protracted War, German Army is Having Supply Problems

Haitong Agency, Berlin, 9th - War correspondent Dr. Lisike reported in the Berlin Stock Exchange yesterday morning that the German Supreme Commander has newly dispatched several army corps to the Eastern battlefield, which will be used to attack the enemy's main positions.

Reuters, London, 9th - The German army is still transferring its tank fleets to join the battle, which obviously has no decisive effect. Recent neutral sources strongly emphasize the truth of the war situation, which cannot be observed solely from the recent German advance. Responsible persons in London said that if the German army cannot make a real breakthrough in the next few days, its efforts may have a very long rest. According to the experience of modern mechanized warfare, armored vehicle units will start to feel tired after two weeks of continuous combat. At the same time, the German army's supply problems will inevitably become more acute, while the Soviet Union, because its rear transportation lines are intact, will be more advantageous in combat. The Soviet army's mechanized units have not advanced as much as the German side, resulting in exhaustion. Yesterday, the Soviet side admitted that the German army had crossed the Vinnitsa River, saying that the army planned to set up defenses on the north bank.

### Roman Newspaper Comments on the War Situation and Admits that Germany's Victory is Difficult

Associated Press, Rome, 9th - "Il Popolo di Roma" today hinted for the first time that the Germans may have some difficulties in breaking through the Stalin defense line. The newspaper also predicted that the German army may have a period of reorganizing its military apparatus before it can fully attack the Soviet Union. Because the Soviet Union is still strong and well-equipped at this time, the newspaper said that the Germans may now be implementing a large-scale reorganization of the war machine. The Germans must now be consolidating the foundation of their transportation lines and military supplies for the second phase of the war. Because the Germans are now fighting against a Soviet Union that has been preparing for more than 20 years, the Germans are now facing a Soviet Union that no longer has the Baltic countries, Poland, Bukovina, and Bessarabia as buffer states. Therefore, the Germans will inevitably take greater precautions. The Soviet Union's preparation for a long-term war is an undeniable fact, and the Soviet army is also structured in a modern way. The Soviet Union's failures in the first few weeks were due to two main reasons: one because the Soviet army lacked the same excellent training as the German army, and the biggest reason was that it was caught off guard by a sudden attack while it was concentrating its troops on the border. However, we should admit that the Soviet army is fighting with great spirit and determination. Whether its commander can prevent the failure of Brest-Litovsk from affecting the overall situation remains to be seen. The future war will be focused on attacking the Stalin defense line. The sooner the German army breaks through the Stalin defense line, the sooner the end of the war will be a matter of time.

### German-Romanian Allied Forces Continue to Advance Eastward, Rumors that They Have Reached the Old Soviet-Romanian Border

Associated Press, Berlin, 9th - The German News Agency reported yesterday that the German and Romanian armies, under the command of Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu, had penetrated deep into the Red Army defense line on the Dniester River, and said that after fierce fighting, they had penetrated into Bessarabia and reached the former Soviet-Romanian border.

Haitong Agency, Berlin, 9th - According to responsible military authorities here yesterday, on Sunday, the German-Romanian Allied Forces in Bessarabia had crushed the Soviet army's resistance, and Soviet fortresses and positions had been captured. The Soviet army had been forced to retreat to the Dniester River.

### Soviet Resistance is Quite Strong on the Kola Peninsula

Havas Agency, Stockholm, 9th - The "Stockholm Daily News" war correspondent has just returned from the front line in Ukraine. According to his talks, the German army is preparing to adopt a strategy of surprise, which is no different from the one adopted in the Battle of France last year. The first step for the German army is to occupy the ports of Murmansk, the capital of Estonia, Smolensk, Kiev, and Odessa. However, the Soviet resistance on the Kola Peninsula is quite strong. Although railway traffic between the port of Murmansk and Leningrad has been interrupted, it has not yet been isolated. The Finnish side also admitted that the war is progressing slowly.

Associated Press, Helsinki, 9th - Last night's official communique also stated that the Finnish army had crossed the Red Army defense line northwest of Latva and penetrated ten kilometers. Another Finnish army also broke through the Soviet defense line and penetrated dozens of kilometers.

Havas Agency, Helsinki, 9th - According to war news released here, the German-Finnish Allied Forces have made progress on all fronts. The German Air Force has launched fierce bombing raids on Soviet rear positions in northern Karelia. The Finnish army has also made progress in central and southern East Karelia. North of Lake Ladoga, the war is progressing smoothly. The besieged Soviet troops on the Hanko Peninsula are now under heavy bombardment. The Soviet Air Force bombed the port of Kotka. Finland suffered very little loss, with ten houses burned.

### The National Government and the Malayan Government Have Reached a Complete Understanding, Overseas Chinese in Malaya are Loyal to the National Government, Diao Zuqian Arrives in Hong Kong and Tells Reporters

Hong Kong - Diplomatic Envoy Diao Zuqian was ordered to go to Singapore three months ago to inspect, and the matter has now been completed. He arrived in Hong Kong by transport today. According to Diao's words to reporters, a complete understanding has now been reached between the Chinese government and the Malayan government. Former Overseas Minister Wu Tiecheng and newly appointed Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi's visits to Malaya have made a significant contribution to this understanding. Regarding the situation of Overseas Chinese in Malaya, Diao stated that they are loyal to the National Government. Previously, Overseas Chinese in the area were only allowed to remit 500,000 yuan of national currency back to China each month, but this has now been increased to 750,000 yuan. It is said that Malaya has been greatly strengthened, and local officials and people are prepared to deal with any eventuality. (Eighth Electric Telegram)

### Will a Large-Scale War Break Out in the Pacific? Speculations in Japanese Newspapers

Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th - The Japanese "Kokumin Shimbun" speculated today that a large-scale war may break out in the Pacific. The newspaper said, "If the United States implements the intentions of the Washington leaders and begins a war of encirclement against Japan, a large-scale war may break out in the Pacific. This encirclement will not only use the lands of China, Britain, and the Soviet Union as military bases, but will also cooperate with elements in China, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. The United States' policy towards the Soviet-German war is to directly and indirectly aid the Soviet Union. The main purpose is to put pressure on Japan, but the United States is still hesitant and undecided, not knowing whether to attack the east and defend the west, or attack the west and defend the east, or fight on both fronts simultaneously. But Japan cannot be as hesitant and undecided as the United States. This is something that the American people should understand."

### Japan's Foreign Trade Plummets, Now Seeking New Markets, Especially Paying Attention to the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam

Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th - According to opinions in Japanese business circles, the Japanese government is aware that U.S.-Japan trade will be greatly affected by the current war, so it is now seeking new markets to replace the increasingly depressed U.S. market. Those in official circles searching for new markets are mostly focusing on India, South China, and Vietnam. The shrinking of Japan's export market has been proven in Japanese stores in Tokyo and Yokohama. Items that Japan previously manufactured exclusively for export can now be purchased in the country. However, Japanese business circles said that U.S.-Japan trade is currently not very unsatisfactory, but they know that the U.S. government has a tendency to impose strict restrictions on imports of Japanese goods. The general opinion is that these restrictions will become increasingly severe. The Japanese are trying to develop the Japanese goods market in Central and South America, but general trade magazines do not express excessive excitement about this. As for Japan wanting to purchase goods from South America that the U.S. government is unwilling to provide to Japan, it is especially difficult. U.S. customers in South America offer prices that are much higher than what the Japanese are willing to offer. Therefore, government experts have drafted a procedure for obtaining new raw materials, preparing to devote all efforts to obtaining all needed raw materials in the "Co-Prosperity Sphere," especially in China and Vietnam. Although Japan's recent economic demands to the Dutch East Indies failed, it is generally believed that Japan will eventually make demands again at the most appropriate opportunity. French and Japanese authorities have completed a new economic negotiation, from which Japan can obtain greater development benefits in Vietnam than before. Japan is also continuing to conduct trade negotiations with the Soviet Union to increase trade between the two countries, but these negotiations have been shaken by the Soviet-German war. The latest Soviet-Japanese trade agreement of 30,000,000 yen has not yet been approved, but Japanese officials have stated that Japan has not abandoned this agreement. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war cut off the Siberian route between Germany and Japan, Japan's only market in Europe has also disappeared. As a result of the decline in Japanese trade in Europe, the Western Hemisphere, and South America, thousands of Japanese overseas Chinese have become unemployed and returned to their country. Every ship from the United States and the South Pacific, especially Australia, the Philippines, and Singapore, carries a large number of Japanese people, and the number is increasing.

### Franco-Japanese Economic Relations Encounter Difficulties, The Matter of Vietnamese Rice Delivery to Japan Will Be Handled According to the Agreement

Reuters, Saigon, 9th - French authorities admit that difficulties have arisen regarding the delivery of rice to Japan in accordance with the terms of the economic agreement, but it does not raise issues of credibility, because the total amount stipulated annually is 700,000 tons, and 400,000 tons have already been delivered in five months. Rice exports have recently exceeded 100,000 tons per month, which is unprecedented in the Saigon market, so the attacks in Tokyo newspapers are considered unfair. It is said that the current plowing season will last until September, and this year's harvest was originally estimated to be around 1.4 million tons, but due to floods and other reasons, it may not exceed 1.1 million tons. According to official rice market reports, all flour mills have stopped working due to a lack of grains. The government is now taking steps. The Governor of Vietnam has issued an order in the name of the Official Rice Committee, requiring the committee to sell all rice to Japan at a stipulated price. All inventories exceeding five tons must be reported, and hoarders will be severely punished. Vietnamese officials argue that all other goods stipulated in the agreement have been delivered on time. They also said that they are unaware of any Japanese pressure on the Vietnamese government, and do not believe in the news from Shanghai that Japan has the possibility of advancing southward. Japanese Consul General Minoda told visiting reporters that some technical difficulties have now arisen, but Japan has not taken formal steps. It is the responsibility of the Vietnamese government to deliver goods in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

### Japanese Lieutenant General Kohsaka Jun Arrives in Taipei

It is also said that the Soviet authorities have stepped up the inspection of foreign mail to prevent the leakage of military secrets.

### The Soviet Union and Poland are Conducting Negotiations to Resolve Disputes Between the Two Countries

Reuters, London, 9th - Representatives of Poland and the Soviet Union will soon meet here to continue negotiations in order to resolve disputes between the two countries and end the state of war that technically still exists between the two countries. The Polish and Soviet sides will first carry out various preliminary work, and then Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and Polish Prime Minister Sikorski discussed relations between the two countries on Saturday and Sunday last week. According to news last night, the discussion was very important and had exciting developments, but there are still many things to be discussed. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that one of the main points of the negotiations is the Polish soldiers who are currently being detained by the Soviet side. It has now been suggested that these Polish soldiers should be reorganized and re-equipped, and placed under the command of the Polish government to fight the common enemy again. British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski at the Foreign Office last night to discuss Soviet-Polish relations and other events.

### British Men Leaving Hong Kong Must Obtain Exit Permits

Editorial

### American Occupation of Iceland

The U.S. military has taken over Iceland, and the U.S. defense line has actually extended beyond the generally perceived Western Hemisphere. This is actually only the first step in a new operation. The other locations outside the Western Hemisphere mentioned by President Roosevelt in his speech yesterday regarding the mission to defend the Americas may be farther from the Americas than Iceland, and thus involve further contact with the outer fringes of the European war. This is naturally an active and extraordinary measure, but it is not necessarily correct to believe that the United States is about to enter the war because of this. For the time being, whether the United States enters the war mainly depends on whether the Soviet Union can contain the Nazi offensive, and it also depends on whether the joint front of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union can be quickly and actively launched. On the Axis side, with the war against the Soviet Union not progressing smoothly, it will not openly take hostile actions against another major power, either psychologically or practically.

In recent days, American public opinion has almost unanimously praised the move to send troops to occupy Iceland and has discussed further steps. This shows that President Roosevelt's exercise of commander-in-chief power to take action in non-U.S. territory outside the Western Hemisphere is implicitly encouraged by public opinion, and it also shows that the sentiment for the United States to enter the war is becoming more mature. From the day that Wilson returned empty-handed from the European War and Peace Conference twenty years ago, American foreign policy has been constrained by isolationism almost every day, especially in the last ten years. However, as the sins of aggression have been indulged and have become more rampant, the struggle against isolationism in the United States has become more intense. Recently, although people like Wheeler and Lindbergh still hold on to their remaining positions, they have lost their original momentum and appeal. The step taken by the U.S. authorities the day before yesterday should be considered an important page in American history in breaking through the constraints of isolationism and taking decisive action.

President Roosevelt's refusal to clearly define the boundary between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres in his speech the day before yesterday shows that he is no longer constrained by the traditional conservative ideas of the past in the United States, but the focus of his current attention is obviously still on the Atlantic. This is probably because Germany is doing its best to attack the Soviet Union and has no time or ability to attend to advances and retreats at sea, rather than because the United States has actually felt a more serious threat in the Atlantic. From the perspective of the actual situation: the heroic resistance of the Soviet Union and the maritime hegemony of Britain are both strong guarantees for the defense of the eastern United States. Although Germany has elite air forces, it lacks a strong fleet to cooperate at sea. The threat it can pose to the United States is not comparable to the direct exposure of the western United States and Alaska to the world's third-largest navy. President Roosevelt's mention in his speech yesterday of the impact on the defensive capabilities of Hawaii and Alaska, especially the fact that the main force of the U.S. Navy has always been stationed at Pearl Harbor, is enough to prove that the U.S. authorities have absolutely not neglected the Pacific. However, judging from their recent concerns and measures regarding the two oceans, they are clearly more active regarding the European situation.

Judging by the consistent policy tradition of the United States, appeasement policies should not infiltrate the U.S. authorities' foreign operations, but their recent lack of vigilance and active measures toward the Far East cannot help but arouse suspicion among some people. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Far East war has clearly merged with the European war. Even in the Soviet Union, which is closer to Japan than the United States, this has been confirmed in Stalin's recent speech. Therefore, in a democratic country that has always adhered to the anti-aggression stance, there should be no distinction between the wars in Europe and Asia. In the current situation, the European war is naturally larger in scale, and its impact on the world is more serious, but the Far East war has always remained an important part of it. Taking a wait-and-see attitude in this kind of situation is by no means inaction, but rather watching for the most favorable opportunity to act. Yesterday's news from Tokyo indicated that Britain's future actions will depend on the true implementation of the Tripartite Pact, which will determine Britain's attitude. This news may not be entirely reliable, but it also means that it will change from active to passive, and its true meaning is that the danger in the Far East has increased again.

From the current international situation, the Nazi blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union has by no means succeeded, and its momentum and even its strength have suffered serious setbacks. Therefore, it has increased the convenience of Britain and the United States to defeat the Nazis. Therefore, although the United States' occupation of Iceland and consideration of further actions are wise, its failure to use the same active measures in the Far East is a major regret. If the northward advance actually materializes, the first to bear the brunt will of course be Vladivostok, but it will immediately endanger the Aleutian Islands and Alaska, and the proposed safety zone recently reported is an extremely important matter. It is certainly not a good thing for the war to expand further into the Pacific, but it is an even greater danger to entrust the security of the Pacific to the goodwill of the aggressor.

### Litvinov Calls for Britain and the Soviet Union to Fight to the End: No Country Can Protect Itself Unless Hitlerism Is Eliminated

Reuter's dispatch from London on the 9th: Former Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov broadcast from Moscow last night, urging Britain and the Soviet Union to continuously and tirelessly strike at Hitler. He said that the German-Soviet war has forced Hitler to transfer his troops from west to east, allowing the British people to rest slightly after experiencing twelve months of continuous bombing. However, Hitler has obviously miscalculated the nature of his attack on the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and Germany had signed a non-aggression treaty, which was recognized by Hitler himself with a solemn declaration. Now that Nazi Germany has perfidiously attacked the peaceful Soviet Union, this has given the world new and overwhelming evidence that as long as the Nazi system and Hitlerism exist, no country, regardless of its policy, can feel safe. The agreements and obligations, promises or guarantees, and neutrality declarations or any relationships made by Hitler and his followers cannot guarantee immunity from their sudden and unprovoked attacks, and peace cannot protect against their repeated attacks at any time. Hitler's main goal is to defeat enemy countries one by one. This is the reason why we should cooperate and continuously strike together. Every strike now has the same effect as those made later, while the cost and sacrifice are greatly reduced. Have we not already learned from the writings and speeches of Hitler and others that Hitler believes that he disdains all concepts of national peaceful coexistence and international obligations and morality? In his autobiography, Hitler himself described how haggard and disappointed he felt during the ten years of international peace. Without war, there is no way to see life, fields stained with blood, cities reduced to ruins, starvation, tears of mothers and wives - these are all elements that Hitler feels happy and comforted by. The Soviet government was the first to recognize the crisis of Nazi aggression against the world and asked all countries to cooperate to stop it and jointly reject it. The calls were made repeatedly, but there were few responses. It is not the time to talk about the reasons for this today. When the house is on fire, the urgent task is to put out the fire. As for why preventive measures were not taken in advance and who should be responsible, it can only be studied afterwards. Europe is now in flames, and other places are also partly in flames. There are already many countries whose independence has been stripped away, whose lands have been trampled on, as if locusts have passed through, and whose people have been oppressed like slaves. And the few countries that are now struggling for a dilapidated independent existence under the illusory cover of neutrality, friendship with Germany, and non-aggression pacts, how can they know that they will not suffer the same fate in a short period of time? Britain and its dominions, with the active assistance of the United States, have fought with Hitler and his huge war machine, which is the result of six years of preparation. Now this struggle has come to the Soviet Union. It is the only responsibility of the Soviet Union to fight to the end against the common enemy. In his sinister plan to attack other countries in order to realize his dream of dominating the world, Hitler has always adhered to the principle of "divide and conquer." He used extremely sinister methods to prevent the invaded from organizing a common resistance, and especially focused on avoiding simultaneous wars on two fronts in the stronger countries in Europe. The Nazi strategy was to select its victims and defeat them one by one according to the circumstances. He originally intended to solve the Western countries first, and then he could freely turn to the Soviet Union, but he failed to fully achieve his wish because he encountered resistance. Hitler has not yet trained as a cross-channel swimmer, so he came up with another plan in his mind, thinking that he had obtained a de facto truce in the West, and might as well carry out his blitzkrieg in the East, and then use all his strength to pounce on Britain and destroy it. At the same time, Hitler hoped to alienate the East and West ideologically, so as to avoid simultaneous attacks on Germany from both sides. However, Hitler miscalculated the lightning nature of the attack on the eastern front and the mysterious power of ideological propaganda in the East. Because British Prime Minister Churchill, on the day that Germany launched an attack on the Soviet Union, announced to the world with his inherent statesmanlike vision that he would not be deceived by Hitler's cunning tricks, and declared that Hitler's victory over the Soviet Union would cause incalculable disasters to Britain. On the Soviet side, too, we know the harm that Hitler's victory in the West will bring to us. The Red Army is now developing its revolutionary miracle, alone resisting the attack of Hitler's entire powerful military machine, and forcing Hitler to continuously transfer his troops from west to east. Therefore, the British people are now getting a little rest. However, there is an extremely important matter that we must not let Hitler have a moment to breathe. Hitler should feel the disappointment that the de facto truce in the West has failed to materialize. Hitler's goal is to defeat them individually, while our goal should be to strike simultaneously and without stopping. Each strike now is ten times more effective than the strikes made later when the strength of any anti-war country is weakened, and the costs and sacrifices can also be greatly reduced. The Soviet Union and Britain are now fighting to preserve their national integrity and independence, so as not to be enslaved. The common victory of the two sides can liberate the people who are now groaning under Hitler's cruel trampling and open up a new path to organize a better life in accordance with the wishes of the liberated countries. The destruction of Hitlerism will be the elimination of the most shameful phenomenon of modern times and the eradication of the greatest obstacle to the development of inherent civilization. The peoples of the Soviet Union and Britain still have various hardships and frustrations and temporary disappointments, but there is no doubt that the peoples of the Soviet Union and Britain know their responsibility to history and to mankind, and will do their best to fulfill their historical responsibility. The Soviet people have now responded with fervent spirit to the call of the head of the Soviet government, that is, our comrade Stalin, and hundreds of millions of strong men have risen up to defend the motherland and embrace the firm determination to continue the struggle together with other free and freedom-loving people until fascist barbarism disappears from the earth.

### German Planes Attack Britain; British Planes Attack German Industrial Areas

### Gandhi Declares: Strive for Freedom Unremittingly; Do Not Hinder Britain's Life-and-Death War

Reuter's dispatch from Martah on the 9th: Gandhi issued a statement today, saying that the British are currently engaged in a life-and-death war. Therefore, in our current struggle, we should strive to reduce impediments. He has reiterated this a thousand times. This movement is not only not intended to harass the authorities, but will also strive to carefully avoid all kinds of impediments. Our struggle will continue indefinitely, at least for five years. It is not necessary to hastily fill the prisons. Merely going to prison cannot bring us closer to freedom. The morality of the people lies in learning to be disciplined, to endure suffering, and to self-sacrifice.

### French Ship Sunk in Turkish Territorial Waters; Turkey Protests to Britain

Havas dispatch from Ankara on the 8th: The French ship "Saint-Didier" was sunk by British aircraft a few days ago in the sea near the Turkish port of Adalia. Fifty-two crew members died and eighteen were injured.

Haitong Agency dispatch from Ankara on the 9th: Turkey has protested to the British government about the British aircraft attack on the Turkish port of Adalia and the sinking of the French ship "Saint-Didier." It is said that the tone of the note is extremely stern. The note was delivered to the British government by the Turkish ambassador to Britain.

Haitong Agency dispatch from Ankara on the 9th: The French authorities issued the following details yesterday about the sinking of the French ship Saint-Didier by the British in the southern Turkish port of Adalia:

The French ship Saint-Didier was about to enter a seaport within Turkish territorial waters when it was suddenly attacked by British torpedo planes, but the ship did not sink and was still able to slowly enter the port. After the ship entered the port and dropped anchor, four more British torpedo planes threw bombs at it and strafed it with machine guns. The shrapnel also damaged other ships docked in the port. The French ship that was directly bombed sank in the port immediately. This incident is quite similar to the "Altmark" incident, except that the attack occurred in a port of a country allied with Britain, and the ship that was attacked was also a ship of a country that was formerly allied with Britain. The French ambassador has protested to the Turkish Foreign Minister about this attack. This is only a statement regarding the sinking of the "Saint-Didier" and no further details are released. As for how the British-Turkish relationship will be affected by this incident, we have yet to see in the future.

### President Chiang's Message to the Military and Civilians of the Nation - The Content Highlights Three Key Points - United with Sincerity and Solidarity to Enhance Combat Power, Promote National Spirit, Establish the Foundation for Revival, Grasp the Key Points of Nation-Building, and Complete the Great Revolutionary Cause

Chongqing, 6th - President Chiang delivered a message to the military and civilians of the nation on the 4th Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. The original text is as follows: "Fellow soldiers and compatriots across the country, today marks the fourth year of our sacred War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Recently, the global situation has seen rapid and clear developments. We are fortunate to encounter such a once-in-a-millennium era, allowing us to contribute our national strength to the world. This is truly the greatest fortune in life. Our cause of resisting aggression and building the nation is arduous, our future is bright, and our spirit is noble and pure. Today, the world has clearly divided into two major camps: aggressor nations and anti-aggression nations. The scope of aggression by the Axis powers is expanding simultaneously in Europe and Asia. All freedom-loving allies naturally stand on the same line to defend common justice and human civilization. I often say, 'We must fulfill our responsibility in the development of the overall global situation to achieve final victory and genuine success in our war effort.' Looking at the international changes over the past year, all the evil conspiracies of aggressive violence have been fully exposed, and the cooperation of anti-aggression forces has been strengthened. All these changes are in line with our expectations. Now, we share responsibilities and cooperate with various allies related to the Pacific. This clear and distinct situation is not accidental. Today, we should express infinite respect and love for all the military and civilian martyrs who sacrificed for the country. At the same time, we ourselves should actively work to fulfill their legacy. The exposure of Japan's political and economic weaknesses does not need further elaboration from me. Looking at it broadly, this year they colluded with Germany and Italy to form the Tripartite Pact, announced the treaty signed in [illegible], declared the 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,' threatened Southeast Asia, and acted recklessly. However, in the South Pacific, the joint defense of the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands was established in the past six months. In the north, the Soviet Union has always seen through Japan's opportunistic tactics and has not abandoned its vigilance. Since the outbreak of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Japan's cabinet and headquarters have frequently held joint meetings, deliberately equivocating externally and trying to cover up internally. Our military and civilians across the country must know that the development of our overall War of Resistance and National Reconstruction and the clarity of the international situation are the results of our four years of struggle. Everything is as we expected. We have restrained Japan for the most important four years for the world, allowing freedom-loving allies to prepare calmly to respond to the aggressive bloc. In these few points, it can be said that the preliminary goal of our War of Resistance and National Reconstruction has been achieved. However, at the same time, we must be vigilant and prepared, because in the world, things often fail when success is within reach. The closer the hope of success, the more potential for failure and danger. In terms of the global war situation, today the key to Asia outweighs Europe. We are a major country in Asia and a central figure in the East Asian war. We should actively strive to take responsibility for the safety of Asia. Therefore, our responsibility today is greater. I want to awaken my military and civilians across the country to have a serious awareness of their own duties, and it is particularly important to have a full understanding of the following three points: First, we must be united with sincerity and solidarity and enhance our combat power. Since the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction began, our national credo has been 'nation above all' and 'victory first.' Today, we have entered a new stage of struggle. The world situation is changing so seriously, and the rise and fall of the nation are so precarious. We should be keenly aware that the world can only respect us if we trust and respect ourselves. Only then can we stand in the world and eliminate aggression. Compatriots across the country must especially understand the importance of consolidating the foundation of the nation. If the nation ceases to exist, everything is empty. If the nation loses its freedom, everything has no anchor. We must establish a national concept based on the interests of the entire nation as the basis for unity. Only then will unity have strength, and only then will victory be assured. Our revolution and nation-building originally had a consistent goal. We should sincerely implement the Three Principles of the People and take on the mission of our time. Second, we must promote the national spirit and establish the foundation for revival. Our great cause of nation-building must be based on the foundation of war. I believe that in our nation-building, material construction is certainly important, but spiritual construction is even more important. With spirit, material construction will not succeed. At present, we are not only lagging behind in science and technology and have poor material construction, but also in spirit, we are not keeping up with the needs of the times. The so-called spiritual construction requires us to first realize that we compatriots have a sacred responsibility and obligation to the country and the nation. We must sacrifice everything to take on this responsibility, thoroughly reflect and strive for progress, and fulfill the duties of citizens. We must be responsible and disciplined in order to achieve success in nation-building. We must be ethical and have a sense of shame in order to remedy past shortcomings and reverse the trend of decline and inertia. In particular, I want to remind our civil servants who have administrative responsibilities to keenly feel their responsibilities and understand that officials are public servants of the people, absolutely ensuring that they do not neglect their duties or make mistakes, that they are worthy of the country and the people. And our compatriots must also jointly be responsible for upholding discipline and fulfilling their duties in order to establish the foundation for our revived nation. Compatriots, do not think that these are ordinary words of exhortation. You must know that after such unprecedented sacrifices and lessons, if we still cannot thoroughly realize and restore the inherent spirit of the Chinese nation, and do not understand morality or have a sense of shame, then the nation will not become a nation, the nation will not become a nation. Even if we win the war, nation-building will still fail. This is a case of failing when success is within reach, and our generation of compatriots will become sinners for thousands of years. Third, we must grasp the key points of nation-building and complete the great revolutionary cause. There are many categories of nation-building work, but the most important are military affairs, education, and economy. These are the three major elements that constitute the vitality of a modern country. Therefore, our military officers at all levels, our people in the education sector, and our civil servants and technical experts engaged in economic construction are the foundation of our nation-building work. The enrichment of combat power and the opening up of the nation's bright future all depend on you to take responsibility. (To be continued)"

### Overseas Chinese in London Commemorate the 4th Anniversary of the War of Resistance with Grand Occasion - Over 300 Overseas Chinese Attended, Ambassador Gu Weijun Attended and Delivered a Speech

London, Special Dispatch, 8th - Overseas Chinese in London grandly commemorated the 4th Anniversary in the past two days. Over 300 Overseas Chinese attended yesterday's commemoration meeting, which was chaired by Guo Bingwen, who introduced Ambassador Gu Weijun to deliver a speech. Mr. Gu first gave a brief review of the past history, then analyzed the current situation in China and the international situation, and firmly believed that final victory would belong to China. The reasons are: (1) China has a wise and decisive leader, President Chiang Kai-shek; (2) The Chinese people are united and determined to win; (3) China's political and economic status has been enhanced after four years of war. China can not only obtain spiritual assistance from all parties today, but also obtain material assistance from the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and the allied territories. Next, Yu Ming and Wang Jingchun also delivered speeches successively. After the speeches, a war film was shown. When The Times commented on the film, it said that the film fully demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of China from the era of Mr. Sun Yat-sen to the present day.

London, Special Dispatch, 8th - At noon today, overseas Chinese held another commemoration meeting at the Chinese Embassy, where Ambassador Gu delivered a speech.

London, Special Dispatch, 8th - The British Aid China Committee hosted a banquet tonight to commemorate the 4th anniversary of China's War of Resistance and to welcome the new Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun. Many dignitaries from various countries attended, all eager to hear Ambassador Gu's first public speech. They all showed the greatest enthusiasm for China's War of Resistance and unanimously expressed their hope that China would win quickly. The banquet was presided over by Lord Cecil, President of the International Anti-Aggression Congress. Among the distinguished guests were Soviet Ambassador Maisky and his wife, Upper House Councilor Lord Listowel, Lower House Councilor Baker, Chinese Minister to the Netherlands Jin Wensi, Financial Secretary Guo Bingwen and his wife, and Chen Weicheng, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy. Chairman Cecil claimed that China was sacrificing for freedom. The four countries of China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union are now united in the great four-corner war for freedom. They will continue to fight until the law, justice and freedom of the whole world are restored. Cecil continued, saying that Ambassador Gu is not only our friend and comrade, but also the ambassador of a major Eastern power. We should work together for peace. If the advice we have put forward in the past has been accepted by the world, then today's world must be more suitable for human survival. At this point, Ambassador Gu stood up and delivered a speech, saying that his predecessor, Guo Taiqi, has a very rich record in his work and is admired by us. The successors should make even greater efforts so as not to fail the great achievements made by their predecessors. Mr. Gu expressed his deep gratitude to the Aid China Committee for its efforts to help Chinese refugees, and said that at present, the Chinese government and the people can unite as one, using the strength of national unity to attack the invaders and prevent them from making further progress. The bloodshed of the Chinese people is not only used to save the country, but also makes a significant contribution to world peace. If China had adopted a policy of non-resistance, Japan would have long since shifted its aggressive blade to the European and American territories in the Far East. No matter what kind of adventure Japan takes, it is currently deeply mired in Asia due to China's War of Resistance and cannot extricate itself. Mr. Gu also said that the Chinese people greatly admire the firm unity and heroic passion of the British people. As for the Soviet Union, although it is currently being invaded, its Red Army and people are fighting bravely. The President of the United States has great wisdom and outstanding leadership talent. At present, these four major countries are already in the same boat. The closer their cooperation, the more reliable their final victory will be. If the United States accelerates its assistance to China, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, the sooner the victory of the three countries will come. China firmly believes that democratic countries can provide China with greater assistance to suit the importance of the Far Eastern front. China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are strongly united, in sync, and marching towards freedom. They will surely achieve final victory in both Europe and Asia.

According to Mr. Lattimore, this statement was made by him before boarding the "China Clipper" to China. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### President Roosevelt Indicates the Elimination of U.S. Defense Boundaries - Three Locations Outside the Western Hemisphere Are Extremely Important to American Security

Washington, Reuters dispatch, 7th - President Roosevelt told the press yesterday that the United States' security interests extend far beyond the Atlantic and that there are a total of three locations outside the Western Hemisphere that are extremely important to the defense of the New World. However, the President refused to clearly delineate the boundaries of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, only clarifying that the only effective way to defend the Western Hemisphere is to protect important locations. He also declined to discuss whether the important interests of the United States in Cape Verde and the Canary Islands have been threatened, and whether Iceland is outside the scope of the Western Hemisphere, saying that he had studied the matter of delineation for several weeks but abandoned it due to its ineffectiveness. The President also declined to indicate whether American troops have been sent to Greenland, saying that such matters are military secrets, and that the occupation of Iceland was a preemptive move that military strategists considered reasonable.

Washington, Reuters dispatch, 9th - President Roosevelt stated yesterday while receiving reporters that there are important places in the ocean that are not related to defense, but outside the hemispheric boundary, there are still extremely important points. Therefore, it is impossible to draw an imaginary line and place buoys on it to serve as markers. The President's remarks have eliminated the hemispheric boundary in American defenses. The President then indirectly answered the question of whether he had received concrete intelligence of Germany's advance into Iceland, saying that he did not think he could answer it concretely, but that before the war, one could put oneself in the place of others and determine what they planned to do. Intelligence sometimes exists and sometimes does not. A reporter asked, "Do you think that others will take action towards the Azores or Cape Verde?" The President replied that he could not predict it. When asked whether there were American troops in Greenland, the President replied that answering this question would reveal military intelligence.

### American Newspapers Openly Suggest Fortifying West African Outposts

Reuters, New York, 9th - American newspapers are almost unanimous in their support of the President's actions in Britain and Iceland, and openly suggest that the United States should fortify its outposts in West Africa in the future. The Washington Post stated that in addition to relieving Britain of its burden, President Roosevelt should also take the lead over Germany in preparing for action on the West African coast, so that "we can make the French understand that we are serious." The Cleveland Plain Dealer stated that "only stubborn isolationists would criticize America's actions in Iceland. The necessity of this move is widely recognized, but this scene still needs to be completed. Dakar still needs to be taken over, and then the thoroughfare to the Western Hemisphere will be thoroughly defended." The Newark Evening Star stated that "America's occupation of Iceland is the most significant blow that Hitler has suffered in the Atlantic war." The San Francisco Chronicle stated that "the Iceland matter is indeed surprising to Americans, but it must be understood that it is unavoidable, for we cannot hope that Hitler would have no intention of using this base." The Boston Globe stated that "Germany has received a warning from this, and knows that the defenses of the Western Hemisphere are not just empty talk." The Knoxville News Sentinel stated that "the occupation of Iceland seems to be another step towards war." The St. Louis Globe-Democrat stated that "the President's decision has greatly reduced the possibility that we might avoid entering the war, but if the US government's diplomatic procedures are implemented, then entering the war is even more unavoidable." The New York Post stated that "this is an insurance policy to prevent foreign attacks from endangering the American continent." The New York Sun stated that "the United States is now in a position where it does not want its commander-in-chief to wait until Congress confirms a threat before taking steps that are urgently needed for national defense." Other newspapers also stated that this is an appropriate way to deal with Nazi forces, and is the most exciting move since the establishment of the Lend-Lease Act.

Reuters, Washington, 9th - When President’s Secretary O'Leary yesterday received newspaper reporters, they inquired about a London dispatch received by the New York Times stating that isolationist Senator Wheeler last week hinted at the US military occupation of Iceland, resulting in the pre-disclosure of military secrets regarding British military actions, and that Britain was greatly angered by this. O'Leary replied that the London dispatch contained language that was quite impartial, such as that German forces could take advantage of this situation and cause British and American soldiers to encounter slaughter. O'Leary did not answer questions regarding the rumored remarks by the newly appointed Middle East Commander-in-Chief, General Auchinleck, that American manpower was needed to win the victory. He only said that he had recently heard from London that British Prime Minister Churchill had stated that the United States should provide war materiel to Britain, and that Britain should be responsible for the war, and he believed that Auchinleck would obey the Prime Minister. A certain reporter instructed Wheeler that he had good information regarding the occupation of Iceland. Molay said that Wheeler was just guessing correctly. As for the rumors from London about the establishment of an air route between Iceland and the United States, he had not heard of them. Havas, New York, 9th - Senator Wheeler, having predicted the US occupation of Iceland last Thursday, yesterday declared that in the near future, the French West African city of Dakar and the Atlantic islands of the Azores and Cape Verde will be successively occupied.

### Churchill Predicts British and American Naval Cooperation

Reuters, London, 9th - Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons today that the US military occupation of Iceland is one of the most significant events since the outbreak of the war. British troops are still stationed on the island, and he predicted that the British and American navies may cooperate to ensure the arrival of supplies and reinforcements to Iceland. The Prime Minister emphasized that this matter is completely integrated with British interests and, on behalf of the House of Commons and the government, welcomed the US military.

Reuters, London, 9th - According to responsible sources, the British troops currently in Iceland will remain stationed there, so it is expected that British and American troops will cooperate to resist any possible German attempt at invasion.

United Press, New York, 9th - A commentator from the National Broadcasting Company broadcast from Reykjavik, Iceland last night that the US troops stationed in Iceland officially landed on the morning of the 8th and were greeted. According to the commentator, who identified himself as a British official, the British troops in Iceland were amazed by the equipment, quality, and quantity of the US military. He said that the US ship escort carrying the troops arrived on Monday afternoon, and British officials boarded the ship to visit the US commander. Only a few of the newly arrived US troops landed on the evening of the 7th, and began landing on the morning of the 8th, and a grand welcoming banquet was held.

Reuters, London, 9th - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the arrival of US troops in British Guiana, Trinidad, and Iceland is welcomed by London, which recognizes this as a sign that the Western Hemisphere is taking the initiative to move its defensive outposts forward to meet the Nazi threat before being attacked. Another piece of evidence that this defensive concept is gradually becoming stronger is the plan proposed by Uruguay, which has been fully approved by the United States. This plan stipulates that if one American country is at war with a non-American country, it will not be considered a belligerent and may use the naval, land, and air force bases belonging to neighboring countries. London believes that the acceptance or rejection of this plan by other American republics can indicate that they are aware of the common danger. The existence of a common danger in the Americas is undeniable, as President Roosevelt's rigorous actions have proven.

Reuters, Ottawa, 9th - Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King commented on the US military's stationing in Iceland, saying that this is a very significant move, and he was delighted to hear that the US Navy was stationed in Iceland.

United Press, New York, 9th - Willkie stated yesterday that he deeply agreed with President Roosevelt's dispatch of troops to occupy Iceland, and hoped that the government's next step would be to use the navy to protect the transport of war materiel to Britain, so as not to be sunk by German ships.

### Germany and Italy Actually Accuse the United States of Attacking Europe's Back

Havas, Berlin, 9th - Berlin authorities stated yesterday that the landing of US troops in Iceland is an unreasonable attack on Europe and an aggression against this neutral small country, which is completely unjustified. Mr. Roosevelt only wishes to bring about a closer proximity to the European war zone because of this. Mr. Roosevelt deliberately moved the United States closer to the battlefield where sharp weapons and war materiel are used, so Mr. Roosevelt should be fully responsible for this action. Berlin authorities declared that since May of this year, Iceland has been considered a war zone, so Mr. Roosevelt is difficult to avoid all the consequences arising from international law. According to Mr. Weissforth, the threat of Germany to Iceland, which drove the US military to occupy the island, is a deceptive remark. However, Iceland protested to Britain when Britain occupied the island, and the Icelandic Prime Minister stated when meeting with reporters that he had also lodged a similar protest against the American aggression. This news has been recorded in American newspapers. Mr. Roosevelt's statement that the United States occupied Iceland with the prior consent of the Icelandic Prime Minister is completely fabricated. The occupation of Iceland actually makes Mr. Roosevelt far from the Monroe Doctrine, and harms the American people. Mr. Roosevelt's action is a trampling on the doctrine that he personally promoted and claimed to be his follower. In order to spread his imperialism, Mr. Roosevelt even used force against a small country with no resistance, so that the United States could interfere in the Eastern Hemisphere. Just when Europe is striving to eliminate the threat of Bolshevism to the world, Mr. Roosevelt disregarded everything and attacked Europe from the rear, which is truly regrettable.

Reuters, London, 9th - Rome issued a semi-official statement yesterday stating that Italy regards the US occupation of Iceland with indifference. The statement concluded that Italy regards this step as an intervention in European territorial waters. Roosevelt, by sending ships into the lock zone, has already borne a heavy responsibility, and now he has broken the solemn promise he made to the American people to win the election, which is that he would not send American troops outside of American territory.

United Press, Rome, 9th - Italian observers stated that the US armed occupation of Iceland is to delineate a broad area so that supplies to Britain can sail unhindered. Italians also stated that the US action is no longer considered to be expanding the "safe zone," but is "an official intervention in European waters." Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaeta, wrote, "The US military's occupation of Iceland is more than enough to directly invite disaster to the United States."

United Press, Tokyo, 9th - Tokyo's Japanese-language newspapers unanimously believe today that the US occupation of Iceland is another step by the United States to bring the entire country closer to war. The newspapers stated that President Roosevelt took this action by taking advantage of the opportunity of the Soviet-German war. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun published an editorial in its usual style, stating that the explanation for the US occupation of Iceland is just an excuse. Based on this view, they should also be able to announce the stationing of US troops in Siberia, because that place is adjacent to Alaska.

### US Aid to the Soviet Union Plan is Proceeding Smoothly, Both Sides are Currently Discussing Details

United Press, Washington, 9th - Undersecretary of State Welles stated yesterday that the methods for satisfying the Soviet Union's request for US military raw material assistance are currently proceeding smoothly. Welles stated that the Japanese government has not yet announced its opinion on the shipment of US war materiel to Vladivostok. Newspaper reports earlier said that Japan will seriously pay attention to this type of freight, because it may contribute to the expansion of the European war to the Far East.

Reuters, Washington, 9th - Undersecretary of State Welles stated yesterday that Soviet Ambassador to the US Umansky has consulted with State Department officials on the Soviet Union's procurement from the US, and that details are currently being discussed. From this, it can be seen that the US aid to the Soviet Union plan is currently proceeding quickly and efficiently. Welles also replied to other questions, stating that the United States has not received any official information that can confirm the claim that Japan will set up a safety zone around its islands to cut off traffic to Vladivostok.

### Icelandic Parliament Convenes Special Meeting

United Press, Reykjavik, 9th - Icelandic Prime Minister Jónasson, after learning that President Roosevelt had issued his declaration to Congress, immediately issued a proclamation. The Icelandic people and newspapers were very calm upon hearing this news. Jónasson read the original text of President Roosevelt's declaration, and explained the details and conditions of the occupation. He also announced that the Parliament will hold a special meeting on the 9th, and the government will give a detailed explanation.

### Winant Advocates Adjustment, British and American Social Efforts

Reuters, London, 9th - At the annual meeting of the National Council of Social Services held in London yesterday, US Ambassador Winant gave a speech, advocating the adjustment of social efforts between the US and the UK, saying that since the UK and the US have tried to adjust their efforts in military and material aspects, their social efforts should also be adjusted, because when we preserve [illegible], we should also try to develop life. He hoped that people sent from one country to another are closely related to the social welfare of both countries.

### President Roosevelt Plans to Request Funds Again, Expanding the Army and Navy

United Press, Washington, 9th - Well-informed members of Congress issued a message yesterday that President Roosevelt and his aides plan to request another $5 billion to $6 billion from Congress. The uses are: (1) About $4 billion for expanding the army's funding; (2) $1 billion for building new warships to strengthen the navies in both oceans. The ships built with this money do not include battleships, but only destroyers and cruisers; (3) Further increase the cost of materiel aid to Britain, this money is in addition to the original allocation of $7 billion.

### Cooperation Among American Countries, Mediating South American Disputes, US, Argentina, and Brazil are Exchanging Views, The Peru-Ecuador Border is Peaceful

Reuters, Washington, 9th - Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the United States, Argentina, and Brazil are currently rapidly exchanging views, discussing appropriate methods to resolve the border conflict between Peru and Ecuador.

Havas, Capital of Argentina, 9th - Foreign Minister Guizzi recently announced that Ecuador's note on the conflict between Peru and Ecuador has been answered by the Argentine government. The government has instructed its envoys stationed in the two countries to suggest mediation to the governments of each country. Brazil and the United States will also coordinate mediation. Generally, Chile and Colombia will also participate.

Havas, Capital of Ecuador, 9th - According to a communiqué issued by the Ministry of National Defense, the Peruvian border areas were generally peaceful today.

United Press, Buenos Aires, 9th - La Prensa reported today that Peru's military preparations against Ecuador are being carried out in cooperation with Japan, which is supplying armaments.

### British Spy for Germany Executed

United Press, London, 9th - Engineer Amos Long, 38 years old, was executed by beheading today in Wandsworth Prison. This is the first time that a British person has been executed under the Treachery Act. Long was sentenced to death on May 8 after a secret trial in criminal court. During the trial, only officials and necessary witnesses were allowed on the scene, in addition to police jurors and defense lawyers. The criminal court implemented security measures during the trial, and the doors leading to the court were also locked. The details were not disclosed to the press. It is only known that the 10 male jurors and 2 female jurors all found Long guilty of two counts of crime. The trial lasted six hours. Long's appeal against the death sentence was unsuccessful. The Home Office announced that Long had been recruited by a German spy agency through a German consulate in the United States a few months ago. Long was later arrested after returning to England. Long is the fifth British person to be sentenced to death under the Treachery Act, but Long is the first to be executed.

### Moji-Shimonoseki Undersea Tunnel Project Nears Completion

Reuters, Moji, 9th - The final section of the Moji-Shimonoseki undersea tunnel, separated by a solid wall, is scheduled to be blasted tomorrow.

All preparations have been completed. Today, a stone drill was used to remove the last meter and a half of granite, and 40 sticks of dynamite were inserted into the remaining section. The detonation will occur when the button is pressed.

### German and Italian Women and Children Evacuated from the Dutch East Indies Will Pass Through Shanghai, Expected to Arrive Tomorrow and Immediately Go to Japan for Temporary Residence, Four Japanese Ships Have Been Requisitioned

German and Italian women and children residing in Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, were suddenly ordered by the government to evacuate this time, and took the Japanese ship Asama Maru to Kobe, Japan. The ship departed from the Dutch East Indies on the 4th of this month and is expected to enter the port tomorrow and dock at the Yangshupu Wharf. All German and Italian refugees on board, except those who have relatives and friends in Shanghai and land here, will be transported to Japan.

German and Italian Adult Men Detained in the Dutch East Indies

Since the economic negotiations between the Dutch East Indies and Japan have stalled, the situation in the South China Sea has suddenly become tense. All German and Italian adult men of conscription age residing in the Dutch East Indies have been detained by the Dutch East Indies government in accordance with wartime emergency laws, to be released after the end of the war. As a result, the general women and children have no means of livelihood, so the governments of the respective countries ordered them to evacuate to Japan for temporary refuge. After consultation with the Japanese authorities, the Asama Maru was requisitioned to transport the evacuated German and Italian women and children. Among them, Germans accounted for 60% and Italians accounted for 40%. All travel expenses are subsidized by the government.

Arriving in Shanghai Tomorrow for a Two-Night Stay

The Asama Maru originally sailed on the Pacific route, and was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month and then sail to the US via Japan. Later, because it was ordered to carry German and Italian women and children away from the Dutch East Indies, it rushed to Batavia from Manila. As for those originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Japan or the UK on the Asama Maru, because the ship has been requisitioned to sail exclusively between the Dutch East Indies and Japan, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha changed to dispatching the Tatsuta Maru to replace the Asama Maru to the US on the 3rd. The Asama Maru was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the Dutch East Indies today, but due to a hurricane en route, it will have to enter the port tomorrow afternoon. It will stay in Shanghai for two nights and is scheduled to depart for Japan on the 12th. The ship will stop running on the original route and will be managed by the Japanese government.

Four Japanese Ships Have Been Requisitioned

According to news from the shipping industry in Manila, in addition to the Asama Maru, the Japanese government has requisitioned three other ships, the Mikawa Maru and two other Japanese cargo ships that usually sail between Manila. The two ships were originally scheduled to arrive in Manila on the 7th, but now they have canceled their voyages to Manila. The number of ships that usually sail to Manila that have been requisitioned has reached four. The Japanese government's measure of requisitioning ships is similar in nature to the British government's requisition of American mail ships. Because the situation in the Far East is currently turbulent, Japan may launch another war, resulting in military transport requiring more ships.

### President Pierce Arrives Today, American Merchant Ships' Schedules Are Kept Secret

The American President Lines President Pierce mail ship, returning to Shanghai from Luzon, is expected to arrive in port this afternoon and leave Shanghai tomorrow morning to return to the US in response to requisition. From now on, the schedules of American merchant ships may not be announced in advance in order to seek maritime safety.

### Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. de Vits, Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon

Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. de Vits, has been staying in Hong Kong for many days after flying from Chongqing. It is heard that the ambassador left Hong Kong by ship the day before yesterday and will arrive in port this afternoon. As for the ship the ambassador is on, it cannot be determined because the shipping company refuses to announce it.

### Japanese Spokesman Comments on the US Occupation of Iceland, Believes it is a Further Step Towards Entering the War, Refuses to Answer Questions About Japanese Actions

The China Press reports that Colonel Akiyama, the Japanese Army spokesman in Shanghai, stated yesterday (the 8th) afternoon while receiving newspaper reporters that President Roosevelt's dispatch of the Navy to Iceland is not just for a summer vacation, but is actually a further step towards entering the war. If Japan sends armed troops to the Dutch East Indies (Japan has no intention of doing so), its importance will be the same as the US Navy going to Iceland. Iceland has declared independence, and the United States has not participated in the war.

No Guarantees About Japanese Movements Either

When asked whether Japan's guarantee not to send troops to the Dutch East Indies can also apply to southern French Vietnam and Thailand, the spokesman replied that just as the United States had not announced the dispatch of the Navy to Iceland before, Japan cannot issue any guarantees about future actions. When asked why Japan opposes the transport of American materials to Vladivostok, the spokesman replied that Japan is quite concerned about the spread of the Soviet-German war to the Far East, and the unloading of war materials in Vladivostok may extend the war to the Far East. When asked whether Japan will take countermeasures if American ships transport war materials to Vladivostok, the spokesman did not answer. When asked what actions Japan will take if American goods are transported to Vladivostok by Soviet ships, the spokesman also remained silent.

### The Rehabilitation Public Bonds Will Be Drawn Today, The Four Banks Accepting Discount Payments for Customs-Guaranteed Domestic Bonds

### Huangpu River Giant Tide Next Month, As High as the Bund Embankment, Total Rainfall Last Month Was Ten Inches

Another new hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean, but it is still far from Shanghai. As for tidal flooding, according to predictions by the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, there will be a giant tide next month that will be as high as the Bund embankment.

Hurricane

According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory, another new hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean, located at 18 degrees north latitude and 142 degrees east longitude, far from Shanghai. It is currently moving in a northwest direction. The wind force is unknown. If the hurricane does not dissipate midway and continues to advance rapidly in this direction, the Chinese coast will be attacked.

Tides

According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter who inquired with the Shanghai Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, the Huangpu River has had high tides for several days, especially the tide at 12:23 PM yesterday, which was the highest, reaching 11 feet and 4 inches, and is expected to return to normal starting from the 20th. However, according to the Bureau's prediction, there will be a giant tide in the Huangpu River in early August, with a height of nearly 13 feet, as high as the riverbank.

Rainfall

Heavy rains fell in late July, with a total amount of 10.08 inches, which is one of the months with the highest rainfall records. The heaviest rainfall was on the 25th of last month, reaching 4.6 inches. Although there was light rain on the 2nd, 3rd, and 7th of this month, the total rainfall was only 3 tenths of an inch.

### Japanese Searched Haig Road, Attempting to Arrest Chinese, Caused by a Misunderstanding Due to Similar Names

On the mornings of the 5th and 6th of this month, the Japanese, together with the French police, searched No. 6 and No. 18, Lane 857, Haig Road twice, reportedly wanting to arrest a Chinese man. However, only a maid was arrested at that time, and no other discoveries were made. It is heard that the Japanese action was because they found that the name of a man in the two houses was similar to the person they wanted to arrest, so they acted quietly and suddenly went to search for him on the mornings of the 5th and 6th, but the result was that they did not find any objects. It is now known that it was a misunderstanding.

### Beautifying the French Concession

In order to beautify the French Concession, the French Concession Police Authority had previously made strict regulations on the style of houses and roads. Now that summer has arrived, many shops often build awnings along the road, which hinders pedestrian traffic, so it has ordered all police stations to inspect and patrol the area, and those who encounter such shading that affects traffic are ordered to correct it, otherwise they will be punished according to regulations. As for the households in the alleys, they often hang clothes across the street, and they are also hung low, so pedestrians have to lower their heads to pass. The Bureau also prohibits this, and violators will be fined 5 yuan each time.

### After the Resumption of Bulk Purchases of Foreign Rice, Sales are Verified and Issued Accordingly, About 5,000 Tons Ordered in Two Days, The Quality of the Second Batch of Rice is Similar to the First Batch

Since the Municipal Council resumed bulk purchases of foreign rice by various grain shops, it proves that the Hong Kong authorities can continuously supply flat-priced Hong Kong rice to the city. The various grain shops, because the authorities have resumed bulk purchases and the legal profits set are very generous, are rushing to order the second batch of foreign rice in large quantities from the authorities. In the past two days, the total number was about 5,000 tons. Rice shops mostly apply to the Litchi Foreign Firm for distribution of the rice they need for sale, with a daily quantity of about 10,000 bags. The authorities approve these applications in accordance with the actual sales volume reported by each rice shop. According to a rice merchant, the quality of the second batch of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai is similar to that of the first batch and is quite suitable for consumption by the general public.

### Official Oath of Allegiance by Judges and Officials: Deadline for Submission Today. All Agencies and Legal Entities Comply. Supporters of the Free Movement Still Active

The French personnel of the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council, Police Department, and consulates, following the official order issued on July 2nd by the French Ambassador to China, Cosme, have in the past few days submitted to their superiors oaths of allegiance to France and its leader, General Pétain.

Oath of Allegiance Limited to Eight Days

French officials have ordered French personnel in the French administrative organs of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou to swear allegiance, with a deadline of eight days, expiring today (the 10th). The period has been sufficient, as most French personnel immediately signed the oaths upon receiving the Ambassador's order. Therefore, it is expected that by today's deadline, there will be virtually no one who has not sworn allegiance, and it will hardly be necessary to implement the Ambassador's order to dismiss those who fail to swear allegiance by the deadline.

Rumor of Oath by All French Nationals

It was reported when the Ambassador issued the order that non-official French sources said the Ambassador might soon order all French nationals in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou to swear allegiance. Those who do not comply, the Ambassador could strip of their civil rights on the grounds that they are engaged in activities harmful to France. However, the French Consulate in Shanghai has not yet indicated that the oath order will soon be expanded to all French nationals in the city. According to French sources, the French personnel of the Municipal Council and the Police Department are expected to swear allegiance in their entirety, as the threat of dismissal for non-compliance cannot be ignored, leaving no alternative but to swear allegiance.

Free Movement Continues to Progress

Furthermore, according to French nationals in the city who support General de Gaulle's Free French movement, they will continue to secretly follow the leaders of the Free French movement in the city. In reality, signing the oath will not affect the sentiments of the majority of French nationals at present. When necessary, they will disregard the oath.

### Shanghai-Nanjing Express Train Suddenly Derails

According to passengers who returned to Shanghai from Changzhou yesterday, at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, the first express train from Shanghai to Nanjing derailed near the section between Danyang and Lingkou, west of Changzhou, around midnight, due to a sudden explosion of a landmine. The explosion destroyed several passenger cars, and the locomotive (the "dragon head") was overturned beside the tracks.

Traffic Interrupted

More than ten zhang of sleepers were destroyed. The number of deaths and injuries is unknown. After the incident, at 8:35 AM the same morning, when the second ordinary passenger train departed, Shanghai had not yet received a report. It was not until the train reached Changzhou Station around 2:00 PM that it was stopped from proceeding by Japanese soldiers stationed there. Passengers disembarked, and the station ordered them to repurchase tickets to return. Those unwilling to repurchase tickets temporarily stayed with relatives and friends nearby.

Location of Mine Explosion

However, according to another report, at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, the first express train from Shanghai to Nanjing derailed near Qixia Mountain, with the passenger cars and locomotive suddenly overturned. The cause was that three to four zhang of the track had been sabotaged by guerrillas.

### Commercial Bank Check Interest Rates

Shanghai commercial banks, considering the abundance of floating capital and the lack of proper investment channels, and to avoid the waste of interest, have adjusted and lowered both fixed and current interest rates according to market conditions. They have also introduced a small check usage fee and stipulated the minimum balance for interest accrual on current accounts. The notices from various banks are recorded below: (1) Zhejiang Industrial Bank: "To our valued customers, due to the frequent transactions of current account holders using checks and deposit slips, and the increasing cost of paper and printing, our bank, in order to cover costs, will charge each account a handling fee starting from July 1, 1941. The fee will be calculated based on the number of checks used, at 2.50 yuan per book of 25 checks, which will be debited from the account at any time by the bank, without issuing replacement checks, to save on procedures. We hereby inform you and request your understanding." (2) Shanghai New China Trust & Savings Bank: "To our valued customers, for check current deposits at our bank, starting from the next period in 1941, balances below 500 yuan per day will not accrue interest. Balances of 500 yuan or more will be subject to the original interest rate, and interest will still be calculated per 100 yuan unit on the interest settlement date. We hereby inform you and request your understanding." However, the measures for interest rate reductions and other matters are determined by each commercial bank individually and are not uniformly decided by the Bankers Association.

### Japanese Ship Narutomaru Sails to Ningbo, Still Unable to Weigh Anchor Yesterday

The Japanese shipping company Toa Kaiun's Shanghai-Ningbo line ship Narutomaru, carrying passengers to Ningbo, was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo yesterday, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to the company, the Narutomaru was originally scheduled to depart for Ningbo at 5:00 PM today, but due to the lack of approval from the Japanese naval authorities, it was still unable to sail yesterday and was moved from the Old Bund wharf to pontoons 26 and 27.

### Thirteen Movie Theaters Receive Extortion Letters: Three Criminals Arrested, Incriminating Documents Confessed, Mastermind at Large

Various movie theaters, large and small, in the British and French concessions of this city have, since May of this year, received threatening letters from Yao Qin, the head of the "Iron Green Corps," demanding so-called "protection fees," ranging from 100 to 500 yuan per month, depending on the size of the theater. If payment was made, a "Quiet" sign would be posted at the ticket office of the theater, and representatives would be sent carrying four beer bottles, from the No. 13 Bund pier, Bobu to Gaomiao, hiring a rickshaw to Jinjiaqiao, where someone would come to negotiate; otherwise, drastic measures would be taken. Some theaters, out of fear, paid the extortion, while others ignored it and reported it to the police. The Xinguang Grand Theater on Ningbo Road and the Great Shanghai Theater on Yu Qiaqing Road were attacked with smoke bombs for failing to pay. Afterward, the Xinguang Grand Theater paid 300 yuan. On June 14, the Guanghua Grand Theater on Aidaoya Road and the Xihai Grand Theater on Xinzha Road received the same threatening letters, instructing them to pay in Pudong. Upon learning of this, the Xinzha Police Station dispatched Chinese detectives Yang Peizhang, Ruan Yao, Ma Zhongrong, and Wang Shidong, together with personnel from the Japanese and Italian military headquarters, and arrested the suspects, Ye Jinbao (aka Jiang Ya Zi, 18 years old, from Ningbo), Zhang Ren (26 years old, from Tongzhou), and Wang Guilin (only 14 years old, from Pudong), at Jinjiaqiao in Pudong. They were brought to the police station, and the "Iron Green Corps" seal, four "Corps Leader" Yao Qin's chops, and many receipts were seized from No. 44, Lane 303, Qipu Road. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention pending further investigation. It was found that the suspects had sent threatening letters to thirteen movie theaters: Guolian, Xinguang, Jincheng, Guanghua, Xihai, Mingxing, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Great Shanghai, Dahua, Great Guangming, Central, and Jindu, extorting amounts ranging from 150 to 500 yuan per theater, obtaining a considerable sum. Yesterday morning, witnesses were summoned, and Ye Jinbao and the others were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin detailed the above circumstances and questioned the defendants, who admitted that all the cases were masterminded by Bai Erzhong, who is at large, and that they were only acting under his direction. All the threatening letters were drafted by Bai Erzhong and copied by Ye Jinbao, totaling about eighteen letters. Subsequently, Judge Shi briefly questioned the representatives of the theaters and ordered the defendants to be detained pending further investigation.

### Yi Tai Hing Coal Shop Nearly Robbed: Police Alarm Scares Away Thieves

At around 12:00 noon yesterday, the Yi Tai Hing Coal Shop at No. 182 Xinzha Road in the Public Concession was suddenly broken into by four robbers dressed in short clothes and armed with handguns. Because only a gatekeeper, Li Zhan'ao (from Tianjin), was stationed at the entrance, the robbers monitored Li's actions. Two robbers entered the accounting room and were about to start searching when an employee realized that a robbery was in progress and quickly fled, disappearing without a trace. By the time a large number of detectives from the police station arrived, the robbers had already disappeared, and the shop suffered no losses.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Provisional Board Meeting

Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, the Shanghai Municipal Council Provisional Board held a routine meeting in the Director-General's office and discussed various reports from the Municipal Council committees.

### Truck Swerves to Avoid Overturned Cart, Crashing into Restaurant Wall

At 12:30 PM yesterday, a truck (No. 15843), fully loaded with yarn bales, was traveling east on Aidaoya Road when it reached the Chengdu Road intersection. At the same time, an empty overturned cart was turning west into Chengdu Road. To avoid a collision, the truck braked suddenly and lost control, crashing into the Hongyunlou Restaurant at the intersection of Beidi'ao Road in the French Concession, creating a large hole in the restaurant's kitchen wall. The yarn bales on the truck also fell to the ground. The empty overturned cart took advantage of the situation and fled. The truck driver believed that the incident was due to the negligence of the traffic police on duty, while the traffic police pointed out that the driver had taken the wrong route. The responsibility remains to be investigated by the police. (Photo by Dahua)

### Shanghai Municipal Council Accounting Director Detained by Japanese Sentry: Stopped from Crossing Bridge, Car Impounded, Apology to Japanese Military Demanded

The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that Mr. Du Ying, the accounting director of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Finance Department, was driving his wife back to their home in Hongkou around 11:30 PM yesterday (the 8th) when they were stopped by a Japanese sentry at the northern end of the Waibaidu Bridge. The sentry asked Mr. and Mrs. Du to get out of the car for inspection, which they agreed to do.

Suspicion Over Eggs

The Japanese soldiers searched the car and found a bag of eggs on the seat. Suspecting that they might not be real eggs, they carefully inspected each one. Mr. Du immediately took an egg and broke it to show them. However, the Japanese soldiers still did not believe him and continued to search. Mr. Du took another egg and threw it away casually to show that there was no danger. Unexpectedly, the Japanese soldiers accused Mr. Du of throwing the egg at them, leading to an argument.

Car Impounded

At that time, a Western police officer from the Hongkou Police Station arrived and led Mr. and Mrs. Du away from the bridge. The Japanese soldiers pushed Mr. Du's car to the side of the road and said that to retrieve the car, he would have to apologize to the Marine Corps Headquarters this morning (the 9th). According to Mr. Du, who spoke to reporters this morning, he had no intention of apologizing to the Japanese military headquarters, but if both sides were at fault, he would be willing to exchange apologies with a Japanese military officer.

### Peculiar Shanghai

— Tao

I recently met a classmate whom I hadn't seen for ten years. When I told him that I had traveled through the Northwest, Southwest, and French Indochina, he seemed very touched and said, "I am now the father of four children. I grew up in Shanghai and have never left Shanghai a single step. I am afraid I will not have the opportunity to travel outside in the future. What do you think of Shanghai?"

I have been in Shanghai for over five months, and I always feel uneasy. What kind of place is Shanghai? I dare not say until now. However, compared to other places, it does seem to have its peculiar characteristics.

It is said that during the Taiping Rebellion, many people fled to "Shanghai," which was still a remote place at that time, for fear of the "long-haired rebels." When I was young, I also saw many relatives and friends living in the countryside move to Shanghai due to wars or bandits. In the past ten years, although there have been wars here, in this "peculiar Shanghai," except for occasional injuries from bombs or stray bullets, the prosperous city has always remained prosperous.

Many foreign travelers, stepping off ocean liners, stay in Shanghai for a few months, and then go back to tell their friends, "China is such and such a place, Chinese people are such and such a kind of people." There are also many compatriots, like my classmate, who have never left this peculiar Shanghai a single step. I am afraid that he might also think that China is just like Shanghai, and his compatriots are just like those he sees in Shanghai.

In fact, Shanghai is peculiar. Shanghai absolutely cannot represent the emerging China. It is better not to come to Shanghai to see the situation in China!

Some people say: Shanghai's cultural level is high. I think this may be true, but you cannot say that completely. Because of the many schools, Shanghai has countless universities, middle schools, and primary schools, and the number of students is considerable. However, I have also seen many university students who do not know where Guilin, Guiyang, and Lanzhou are: just like a reader wrote in the Continental Daily a few days ago, he said: Shanghai has many university students with shiny hair, fashionable suits, and memorized the names of American movie stars, but they only need to muddle through four years of schooling to get a diploma! I have also seen many Shanghai students who cannot write with a brush, or even write a simple letter home. This is because there are many places here where you don't need to use a brush or write Chinese characters. They will never need these in their lives, so they are too lazy to put in the effort.

In today's Shanghai, you can see newspapers and movies promoting various countries, and you can also read news from all directions. It seems that this place can also be considered "free China"? But is it really free? I think no one will explain.

The "China Incident" has not yet ended. In Chongqing, the wartime capital of free China, there are several hours of air raid alerts every day, and people's lives are extremely tense. Shanghai is still a peaceful world of singing and dancing. The lives of some people are also tense, but they are tense about the rise and fall of gold prices, exchange rates, and commodity prices.

I met several fellow villagers who grew up in Shanghai in the inland areas. They said: Which place is more prosperous than Shanghai among Hankou, Changsha, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Guiyang, and Kunming? They seem very proud of being Shanghainese when talking about it in front of others. Shanghai is really a place you can't miss. In fact, I don't think being a Chinese in Shanghai is more glorious than being a Chinese elsewhere. However, Shanghai is indeed a place worth visiting. On this "ten-mile foreign concession," if you are happy to take a closer look, you will not worry about discovering many peculiar characteristics.

### Heinous Robbery and Murder Case on Dongchang Road, Pudong: Lu Daozhang Bound and Strangled, Valuables Looted

A bizarre case of robbery and murder occurred in the early morning of the day before yesterday at No. 7, Renji Lane, Dongchang Road, Pudong. The victim was Lu Daozhang, a practitioner of both Chinese and Western medicine. The details are recorded as follows:

Modest Savings

Lu Daozhang, a local Shanghainese, was 32 years old. He originally lived in Tangjiabang, east of Laobaidu in Pudong. He now rented a newly built building at No. 7, Renji Lane, Dongchang Road, where he practiced medicine. In recent years, his medical practice has flourished. His wife, Mrs. Lu, worked at the British American Tobacco factory in Pudong, leaving early and returning late, earning a monthly salary of over 100 yuan. In addition to practicing medicine, Lu also engaged in other businesses, so he had modest savings. The family lived a harmonious life.

Suddenly Strangled

At 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, his wife, Mrs. Lu, got up and went to work, taking the Yale lock on the door with her. (There were no servants in the Lu family.) Around 9:00 AM, a maternal uncle and cousin Zhang Miaogen came to visit and found Lu's door half-open. The medical room was empty, and no one was waiting inside. They waited for a long time, but there was no sound from upstairs. Realizing that something was wrong, they went upstairs to investigate and found Lu with his hands tied to the side of the sun deck stairs and his feet also bound. His head was wrapped in a towel, and his neck was surrounded by several strands of cotton yarn rope. They were shocked and immediately untied him, but his body was ice cold, and there was no way to revive him.

Money Looted

His wife, Mrs. Lu, learned of the tragedy when she got off work at noon and staggered home, weeping over his body. Upon inspection, the 3,000-odd yuan in legal tender and four bank passbooks stored in the box, as well as Lu's chop, were all missing. Also missing was the wristwatch worth 160 yuan that Lu was wearing. Judging from the situation, it seemed to be a case of murder for money.

Family Grieving

Lu's parents are still alive at his family home in Tangjiabang. His father, Lu Haitao, is nearly 60 years old and works as a farmer. His younger brother, Lu Chaosheng, is a businessman. Lu left behind three sons, the oldest being 11 years old, the second 8 years old, and the youngest still in his arms. The eight-member family relied entirely on Lu for support. This sudden misfortune has left the family without any means of support, causing heartbreak to all who hear of it.

### Dismembered Female Corpse Case Formally Indicted: Passbooks, Prostitution Pledges Unearthed, True Facts of the Case Cleared Up, Hearing Postponed

Zeng Liang, a 42-year-old woman from Suzhou, residing at No. 10, He'an Lane, Lane 139, Changsha Road, was murdered on the 7th of last month, and her body was dismembered and abandoned at the intersection of Baker Road and North He Road and in the Suzhou Creek. After detailed investigation by Chinese Detective Chief Wang Runhe and Detective Chen Baozhong of the Xinzha Police Station, it was learned that the case was committed by the deceased's common-law husband, Sun Wang. The motive for the murder was that the deceased had considerable savings, so he did not hesitate to kill her and seize her property. Subsequently, Sun Wang's younger brother, Wang Gendi, his wife, Wang Ding, and Ma Jinhai, Wang Amao, and others were arrested in Suzhou and sent to the First Special Court, requesting detention. The details were reported in this newspaper. During the adjournment, the police investigated and learned that the deceased, Zeng Liang, whose original name was Liang Peiying, was likely from a brothel. According to the confessions of the arrested criminals, a passbook in the name of Liang Peiying, Yong'an Company account No. 28148, was found at the home of Ding Peiliang, a friend of Wang Gendi, at No. 5, Lane Shengqing, Wenjianshi Road, with a balance of 1,010.22 yuan. Also found was a pledge and loan agreement for 500 yuan from Shen Shiqing, mortgaging a 17-year-old girl, Xiuying, to the deceased to work as a prostitute for a period of five years. The whereabouts of the girl are currently unknown, but she could be rescued from the fire pit. In addition, 22 pawn tickets belonging to Gendi and his wife were found. The discovery of the above items conclusively proves that the defendants did commit the crime of murder for money. Therefore, when Judge Lin of the Criminal Division of the First Court held a hearing yesterday morning, police lawyer Ru Baoyi formally filed a public prosecution on the charge of murder. After questioning by Judge Chuan, a postponement of one week was ordered for further investigation.

### Grains: Fortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Council Dumps Rice, Rice Prices Still Difficult to Raise as Desired

Yesterday, the opening of the morning market for foreign rice showed no signs of weakening buying interest. Continuing the rising trend of recent days, speculators have not forgotten the possibility of further rises. The general increase of 6 yuan in the price of publicly sold Hong Kong rice is seen by followers as a reason for prices to rise further, without realizing that the market price of rice has already risen by two or three increments of 6 yuan, and the increase in the price of Hong Kong rice is only the first increment of 6 yuan. Furthermore, after the price increase, it is dumped in large quantities, with prices of 135.05 yuan and 136.5 yuan, which is much lower than the small bags of 154-155 yuan on the market. Therefore, once it is released in large quantities, the market is immediately suppressed. The current market price for small bags has fallen to 153.78 yuan, with a range of 156.2 yuan to 155.5 yuan. Siamese No. 2 ranges from 148 yuan to 147 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day by about 1 yuan. The current rice price is initially falling, with most prices remaining flat and some slightly decreasing by a few cents to 1 yuan. The closing market prices are 133 yuan and 132.5 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 127 yuan for high-quality No. 2 to 122 yuan for small bags, 126 yuan for high-quality No. 2 Siam to 123.5 yuan, 129 yuan for Huowen to 128.5 yuan, 130 yuan for Jiafu rice, 135 yuan to 134.5 yuan for Mindang, and 128 yuan to 126 yuan for Xiaowen. Broken tip rice ranges from 99 yuan to 96.5 yuan.

Thick and thin japonica rice and fresh early and late rice from Nangang have been rising sharply in recent days. Carriers are feeling excited due to the considerable profits that can be made, and the arrival of goods is suddenly showing an increase. However, scarcity makes things valuable, and abundance makes them cheap. Sellers are loosening their selling intentions, and local shops and customers are no longer worried about missing out. Buying intentions are also declining sharply. Supply is temporarily exceeding demand, and it is difficult to maintain the high prices, with a return depreciation of more than 2 yuan immediately visible. The quoted prices, excluding particularly fresh goods, are still at 147 yuan, with ordinary fresh goods at 144 yuan and 143.5 yuan. The original Wuxi bags of overnight japonica, as the previous ones have not been fully collected, remain unchanged and are still priced at 134 yuan, and specially processed goods at 136 yuan.

Whether it is domestic or foreign glutinous rice, market goods are scarce, and the outlet is difficult to unblock, ultimately reaching a conclusion. Continuing sales of Hong Kong white yuan are at 126 yuan, then down to 123 yuan, glutinous tea at 115 yuan, and Jindan domestic glutinous rice at 118 yuan to 116 yuan.

### Flour Market Hovering with Stability

Flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market condition saw robust demand from local customers due to the recent high gold exchange rates and rising rice prices. Speculative buying and selling were active, showing strong interest. After a slight downturn in the afternoon the day before, the market opened strongly yesterday morning with increased buying interest. Yu Long Flour immediately rose by 20 cents, reaching $33.60, and Pao Tai Flour was at $34.30. However, some profit-taking occurred at higher prices, causing Jin Long Flour to ease to $33.45 and Pao Tai Flour to $34.20. Other brands included Five Swallows at $30.60 and Cai Shen Flour at $32.50. Overall, the market remained tight, with an estimated 20,000 bags changing hands. It is anticipated that the market may experience another period of consolidation.

Wheat: Trading remained quiet. Currently, the new wheat is under control and prices are high, so sellers are holding firm. Asking prices have reached $46-47, while Japanese factories are still limited to original purchase prices, resulting in no available stock.

### Securities: Public Bonds in a Dilemma, Both Large and Small Denominations

Public bonds on the unofficial market saw prices first decrease and then increase yesterday. Class C bonds briefly fell to a low of $70.08, but then recovered, showing an increase compared to the previous day and remaining in a hovering pattern. Analyzing the hovering trend, smaller denominations are hovering to a smaller and smaller degree, each time reaching new low prices, while larger denominations cannot exceed recent high prices, hovering downward. When this will end is difficult to predict. However, it is expected that there will not be drastic changes before interest payments. Yesterday morning, Yongchang bought Class E bonds, Forty-one Securities bought Class B bonds, and Yongkang bought Class A bonds, satisfying their demands. Tongshun and Xiexingyuan bought both Class B and C bonds, but Renchang sold heavily, supplying Class A, B, and C bonds in large quantities. Additionally, Shuntai, Tongkang, Yizhong, and Yitai also transacted. Class C bonds briefly broke the one-dollar mark, but were ultimately pulled back up. In the afternoon, Lianhe was a more active buyer, and Yongchang also had remaining strength to buy Class C bonds, raising the price to $1.75. Hongda, Renfeng, and Yichang took advantage of the higher prices to sell. As a result, prices for all classes except Class D, which did not trade, uniformly rebounded by 20-70 cents. The total value of transactions was approximately $1.7-1.8 million. A brief table is provided below.

Stock trading: 50 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company stock were traded at a price of $22.75.

Also, the stock market at the Public Industries Exchange, after a brief period of activity, turned dull. The previously gained prices were subsequently lost again, with a very uncertain trend.

### Finance: HSBC Provides Supply; Foreign Exchange Buying Spree Ceases

Foreign exchange market conditions yesterday: HSBC's listed rates were unchanged. The gray market for British and American currencies initially tightened and then returned to level. Continuing the tight trend from the previous day, Chinese merchants and speculators engaged in aggressive buying, causing the August American exchange rate to tighten to $5.15625 and British gold to 3 pence 1 7/1875. Yenfeng small counters quoted the American exchange rate at $5.125, down by 0.0625. Subsequently, HSBC suddenly supplied currency at $5.1875, immediately halting the speculative buying spree. Hong Kong Electric also sold off, reaching a high of $5.21875 for hard currency. British gold also returned to level. In the end, both exchange rates were the same as the previous day's closing prices, with limited trading. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

Afternoon Closing: Spot Rates All Level

Since the morning, foreign dispatches indicated that the British, American, and Indian silver markets were all level. Among exchange rates of various countries, the British exchange rate against Shanghai was down by 0.0625, while the rest were level. The opening prices in the domestic market were selling prices from banks, with the spot rate for British currency at 3 pence 1 8/1875 and American currency at $5.1875. After the opening, amidst the chaos, speculators aggressively bought the July-August rate at $5.1875, tightening it to $5.15625. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. HSBC suddenly released August currency at $5.1875, stopping the speculative buying. Furthermore, Hong Kong Electric aggressively offered August currency at $5.21875. The Bank of England advantageously absorbed currency, making it difficult to settle the August rate at $5.21875 by the midday closing. The midday closing rates for both spot and August contracts were 3 pence 1 8/1875 for British currency and $5.875 for American currency, both the same as the previous day's closing prices, with the spot rates all level.

### Hong Kong Dollar Market Remains Firm

Yesterday's foreign currency market: the "boiled red" market price rose and then returned to level. The British, American, and other pound rates also rose and then turned level. British gold notes tended to be stagnant, with market prices standing at level. American dollar notes opened at $19.30. After the opening, Da Feng, Fenghe, Zhenhe, Changji, Liji, etc., sold, retreating to 0.09. Subsequently, due to competitive buying from sellers such as Xiang Tongxing, the price rose to $0.14. The midday closing was at $19.12, down by $0.03 compared to the previous day. Spot prices still needed to be reduced by about $0.25. The trend for Hong Kong dollars remained tight, rising to $4.75 in the evening market. Japanese gold notes rose sharply by $0.05, rising to $2.01 in the evening market. Korean notes also tended to rise, increasing to $1.60 in the evening market.

### Universally Shorting at High Prices; Gold Market's Bullish Trend Dampened

Yesterday, the "boiled red" gold market in the gray market first rose and then returned. After breaking through the 6,700-yuan mark three times, it immediately retreated each time. The sentiment among various parties changed from firm to tired, and the bullish camp gradually showed signs of wavering. Foreign exchange weakened from tight to level, as HSBC and Hong Kong Electric both supplied currency. There were also widespread rumors of Japan advancing south. Therefore, despite the bullish camp relying on the remaining momentum from the past three days to actively operate, it was already at the end of its strength. The Guangdong merchants shorted up to 7,000 taels, and the securities firm De Fu also shorted 3,000 taels. Western merchants continuously sold. At midday, the price retreated to 6,660 yuan, eventually closing up by a small amount. A total of 50-60,000 taels were traded in half a day. In the afternoon, there was no market due to Wednesday. Off-market prices had retreated to 6,645 yuan, requiring a markup of just over 20 yuan. Cash also marked down a small number of yuan, with Yida selling 50 taels to Tianyuan at a price 180 yuan higher than the forward contract, and then Zhongxing offered 10 taels at 270 yuan higher. Gold jewelry initially rose by 5 yuan, then returned to level, still at 715 yuan.

Futures Briefly Exceeded the 700-Yuan Mark

Starting in the morning, each bar (10 taels) opened at 6,680 yuan at 9:15, marking an increase of 13 yuan. Gold shops and retail investors aggressively bought, surging to 6,705 yuan in an instant. Yi Yuan, De Da, Da Feng, and Yi Da aggressively sold, retreating sharply to 6,675 yuan. Xinfengyong, Chengji, and Hesheng aggressively bought, and Yida repurchased. With the August American dollar settling at only $5.15625, the price surged by 35 yuan to 6,710 yuan. Upon hearing that HSBC was supplying American currency, Da Feng, Litai, and Yi Yuan, from the Shanghai West merchants, sold again, hovering between 6,680 and 6,690 yuan for a long time. Near midday, Hengji and Defu vigorously dumped, falling more sharply. At midday, the price retreated to 6,660 yuan. Litai repurchased, and Xinfeng and Yong also bought. The midday closing was 6,669 yuan, up by 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Based on the settlement price of $5.1875 for the American dollar last month, it was 6,713 yuan, marking a suppression of 44 yuan. After the closing, it was 6,664-5 yuan, with a difference of 50 yuan in the first half of the day. There was no market in the afternoon. Off-market prices had fallen to 6,645 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own-brand gold was 280 yuan higher than the "boiled red" forward contract price. Purchases were 80 yuan lower than sales. There were no prices or market for the current gold standard.

Jewelry Gold Rose Sharply and then Returned

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Sugar Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market remained tight and strong, continuing to rise. The association's quoted prices for spot goods: June delivery of No. 24 coarse white sugar was $96.50, May delivery was $95.80, April delivery was $95.20, March delivery was $94.80, and February delivery was $94.60, all up by 70-80 cents. July 20 delivery was $97.40. Dutch red KD mark was $77, NT mark was $75.50 to $75, up by one yuan. Taikoo refined white B mark new goods were $113, up by 50 cents, and old goods were $111. HX mark new goods were $94, up by one yuan, and old goods were $92.80. CC mark refined ice sugar was $108, up by two yuan.

### Yarn and Cotton: Profit-Taking Emerges; Cotton Yarn's Rising Desire Halted; Highest Price Seen at $1,641

The yarn market initially rose and then leveled off, but the trend remained strong. The situation in the domestic raw cotton market was still rising, so bullish investors were not bearish. Although the current selling price of yarn was firm, the enthusiasm of buyers was not as strong as before. However, today's exports to Hong Kong amounted to 1,840 bales, resulting in a group of bullish investors taking profits, and the market turned halfway. Some people said that recently the price of 42-count thread was already expensive, and 32-count single yarn was even more expensive, with the average selling price at around $2,200. In comparison, the price of 20-count yarn averaged around $1,600, which was considered relatively cheap. If the cotton market did not loosen, shorting seemed uneconomical. The high price for 20-count Double Horse brand was $1,641, and the low price was $1,628. However, in the afternoon, a sudden decline occurred. The opening price was $1,630. Following rumors of a southern advance, the market gradually declined to $1,609. According to market investigations, some "scalpers" dumped 1,000 bales, and another household dumped 500 bales, putting pressure on the market. The final price was $1,614-5, with securities firms being the main buyers.

Double Horse brand opened in the morning, continuing the firm and rising trend from the previous afternoon. The initial price was $1,635, but buying interest was very strong, rising to $1,641. Subsequently, upon hearing that the gold standard had opened higher and then returned to level, profit-takers dumped, easing to $1,629. However, with lower prices, there were still plenty of buyers, rising again to $1,635. The closing price was $1,630. According to statistics, 6,000 bales were traded in half a day, with 500 bales bought by Hong Kong merchants and 5,500 bales bought by domestic merchants.

Morning Market Conditions for Gold Double Horse Futures: The market opened in the morning, continuing the remaining momentum from the previous day. Foreign cotton futures continued to report rising prices. Short positions in near-term contracts were actively covered, with both July and August contracts rising by $4-$6.5. Upon hearing that spot yarn had risen and then eased, the September contract immediately fell by $4. Subsequently, there were more sellers than buyers, and market prices softened. The midday closing saw declines of $1-$7, with 11,240 bales traded. There were rumors of a Japanese southern advance and other bearish news in the afternoon market, causing bullish investors to sell and short positions to exert pressure, and market prices trended downward. As a result, all months fell by $15-$18 compared to the previous day. A total of 20,340 bales were traded throughout the day, an increase of 6,500 bales compared to the previous day. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the entire day are recorded on the left (net prices quoted).

### Cotton Sales Brisk; Prices Difficult to Loosen

The current cotton situation remains firm. This is because the American and Indian cotton markets are consistently advancing, and purchase prices are increasing daily. Therefore, those holding goods are particularly firm and unwilling to act rashly. The yarn market declined slightly in the afternoon, and the situation was slightly level, but prices were still difficult to loosen. In reality, the source is not smooth, and inventory is gradually decreasing, so the trend is excellent.

### US Government Report: Initial Reduction in Cotton Fields

Washington dispatch: The US government's first cotton field report for 1941 indicates that the cultivated area is 23,519,000 acres, a decrease of 1,352,000 acres compared to the first report last year. The original dispatch is recorded on the left (cotton field units in thousands of acres, cotton units in thousands of bales).

### Medicinal Materials: Zhaopi (召皮) Firmly Rises

Zhaopi has not arrived for a long time, and store inventories have long been exhausted. It is now reported that someone has managed to obtain a batch in Shantou. The goods are still good. At a time when values ​​are in great shortage, the product is very attractive. The offer price has suddenly risen by more than ten yuan.

### Piece Goods: Bullish Investors Take Profits and Sell; Cotton Cloth Returns in Afternoon

Factory Cloth: The market was firm and stable yesterday morning, turning tired in the afternoon. This was due to the continuous price increases in recent days, prompting bullish investors to take profits and sell. Actual sales were sluggish, causing market prices to fall again. As a result, white goods, fine cloth, and twill fell by 25 cents per piece. Coarse cloth was stable. Some dyed cloth fell by 50 cents per piece. The street was watching and waiting. Transactions included over 200 pieces of current goods and grey cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong buyers purchased several hundred pieces of colored cloth and twill. Southeast Asian buyers purchased over 100 pieces of printed cloth and bleached cloth. Shandong buyers purchased 50-60 pieces of coarse cloth and woolen cloth. Furthermore, 1,225 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Hong Kong today (the 10th).

Eastern Piece Goods: The morning opening trend was firm and rising. In the afternoon, due to unfavorable news, various cloths suddenly turned downstream. Fine cloth from the leading factory opened at 50 yuan, reaching a high of 50 yuan and 3 jiao. The closing price in the afternoon was 49 yuan and 1 jiao, similar to the previous day. Called "Gentleman Serge" opened at 1 yuan 6 jiao 3 fen and a half in the morning, rising to 4 and a half fen, then falling back to 1 yuan 6 jiao 1 fen in the afternoon. The closing price recovered slightly by 7 li and a half, falling by 1 fen per yard compared to the previous day.

### Woolens Remarkably Strong

Woolens and flannel: In previous years, the market atmosphere usually turned tired and sluggish at this time of year. Most of the summer goods for actual sales were gone, and the sales of autumn and winter goods were still pending. Business generally turned light. However, this year, due to the special domestic and international situation, the market for woolens is also unusual. Summer goods, more than half of which have been sold, not only show little fatigue but often turn from weak to strong. For example, Wanliding and White Serge even rose in unison. Due to the intercalary June, the outlets are mostly retail, but they are more prolonged and heavily sold than in previous years. Autumn and winter woolens have all been on the market for sale one or two weeks earlier. Selling prices are high due to the difficulty in sourcing and the possibility of stockouts. The public sees goods as rare treasures, and the market is remarkably strong. Yesterday, British-made Wanliding was priced at 40 yuan per yard for retail cuts, while locally made goods were priced from 27-28 yuan to 30 yuan. Medium-thick and ordinary White Serge is very scarce and popular. Navy Serge sells for 35-36 yuan per yard, with higher-grade goods even more scarce and trending upward.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Cakes Continue to Decline; Red Beans Firm and Popular

Yesterday's soybean cake market continued to decline sharply. This was because actual sales were still sluggish, and many holders intended to release their holdings as the futures delivery date approached. Therefore, prices fell sharply again by 60-70 cents. The sale included 1,000 pieces of Kai Da soybean cakes and over 20,000 pieces of Shengji cake futures (price details in the market price column). Today, 4,200 pieces of soybean cake are being shipped to Hong Kong. Recently, the source of red beans has been very scarce. Because existing inventory is gradually drying up, the sentiment is remarkably firm. Yesterday, this street bought over 100 bags of Wuhu red beans at a price of 55 yuan.

### Hardware: Black Iron Billets Gradually Increasing

The black iron billet market, which has been booming for a long time, has recently become even more expensive. This is because overseas sources have disappeared, and local inventories are being sought after by various factories and users. The circulation of goods is increasingly insufficient, causing the standard market prices to continue to increase. Yesterday, the asking price for old steel factory goods was 4,200 yuan for 2,000 pounds, and Huilindeng goods were also sold for 1,000 yuan per bundle, which was 100-200 yuan higher than the previous market. Furthermore, inventories in the Shanghai market are not abundant, and demand is increasing. There is a possibility that spot goods in the Shanghai market may be exhausted.

### Miscellaneous Items: Hemp Bag Prices Reach a Peak

Hemp bags have recently been dull in disposal, and prices have reached a peak. Therefore, although inventories are thin, they will inevitably loosen. New and old bags are reduced by 20-30 cents each. Indian hemp rope is reduced by 50 cents per pound. Indian hemp cloth is reduced by 2 cents per pound. Domestic hemp cloth has not changed much. Green hemp is reduced by 5-6 yuan per piece. The detailed market prices of various grades are listed below.

### Coal: Huainan Fines Sell Well

The coal fines market: Recently, after Kailuan fines were priced high, the general lower-grade goods took the opportunity to rise, very briskly. The handling fee was also raised, not without reason. Yesterday, Huainan bulk coal sold for 295 yuan per ton, and coal fines sold for 264 yuan, all from the warehouse to the customer's car, and an additional handling fee was required. It is said that more than 300 tons were sold in one day.

### Tennis Champion Carson Leaves Shanghai: Championship Likely to Belong to Chinese Players

Carson, the singles champion of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Championships for six consecutive years and the city's singles leader, has left Shanghai for the United States a few days ago. This will create an excellent opportunity for Chinese players to win the men's advanced singles and doubles titles this year. In the singles competition, Chinese players such as Wang Wenzheng, Zhang Dingzhao, Xu Chengwei, Li Guofan, and Tang Baojia are all top-notch players. Apart from Colasa, there are no outstanding Western players. Wang Wenzheng is considered the most likely to win the championship. In doubles, there are also Chinese players such as Wang Wenzheng, Lin Baohua, Yang Guofan, Tang Baojia, and Xu Chengwei. In the previous competition, Wang Wenzheng and Li Guofan teamed up and reached the finals week but were ultimately eliminated by Carson and Squia, finishing as runners-up. They should be able to fulfill their long-cherished wish this year. Furthermore, it is believed that the Chinese team, Wang Wenzheng and Lin Baohua, can overwhelm all opponents in the international Rober Cup doubles championship and are likely to win the title.

### Academic Lectures: Methods of Historical Research (4)

— Xue Wujing

(2) Discovery of Antiquities. It is easy to discuss modern history, difficult to read medieval history, and even more difficult to read ancient history. Prehistoric history is even more vague and unknowable. Modern and medieval history, I will put aside for now. When it comes to ancient history, it is full of mysterious and strange events. For example, Wu Xu Zheng's San Wu Li Ji says that Pangu, who opened up the heavens and the earth, said:

"The heaven and the earth were chaotic like a chicken egg, and Pangu was born in it. After 18,000 years, the heaven and the earth were opened up. The clear Yang became the sky, and the turbid Yin became the earth. Pangu was in it, changing nine times a day, becoming divine in the sky and holy on the earth. The sky rose one zhang every day, the earth became one zhang thicker every day, and Pangu grew one zhang taller every day. After 18,000 years, the number of the sky reached its highest, the number of the earth reached its deepest, and Pangu reached its greatest length. Then there were the Three Sovereigns."

This myth is truly a bizarre spectacle. Other stories, such as the red dragon's influence on Nüwa, Shennong's dragon head, and the Big Dipper shining on the suburbs and influencing Fubao to give birth to the Yellow Emperor, are even more unclear whether they are gods, humans, or beasts. Therefore, a modern writer simply started with the Qin Dynasty, using a light touch on the history before Qin, almost dismissing it with a single stroke, which is perhaps too much. The Twenty-Five Histories do not mention a word about prehistoric history. However, in recent times, after the ancient artifacts unearthed from the ground were discovered, archaeologists emerged like clouds, compiling reports on their research. Although there is no complete and systematic ancient history for us to refer to, the subjective psychology of previous historians has been greatly changed. This is something we should emphasize and should be noted by scholars of history. The details are as follows:

### Shell Shock Syndrome

— Xiao Yun

During the First World War, a young Australian soldier suddenly suffered from shell shock on the battlefield and became unable to speak. He was sent to a field hospital for treatment. The treatment went well, and his ability to speak gradually returned. At this time, the hospital was attacked by enemy aircraft several times, and the nurses had to move the patient to a safe location in haste and confusion. Unexpectedly, after this second fright, the young soldier developed a strange condition. He completely turned into a child, unable to speak. When given a pencil, he was at a loss and did not know what to do with it. He seemed to have forgotten the uses of various common objects around him, examining them with a curious and fearful attitude. He walked unsteadily, and if no one supported him, he would fall to the ground and crawl like a child. He could not feed himself. When the nurse fed him, she had to taste each bite first. He sometimes whimpered and cried, and he liked toys. Other than his adult size, his demeanor was no different from that of an infant. This rare phenomenon of "rejuvenation" is called regression in abnormal psychology.

A person needs considerable courage to charge into battle on the battlefield. This young Australian, fearing both the battlefield and being seen as a coward, unconsciously lost his ability to speak, achieving the goal of "not having to fight." Later, when he encountered an air raid, his condition worsened, and the regression phenomenon occurred. This was entirely an act of avoidance, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand.

Life is like a battlefield. To be a good soldier, one must summon courage and face reality. The result of avoiding difficulties is always tragic.

Physiology

### Six New Senses

— Guo Dongcai

Perhaps you have always thought that your body has five physiological senses for receiving external stimuli. However, medical scientists now tell us that humans actually have eleven senses. In addition to the five "old" senses we are already familiar with: sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, we should now add the following six "new" senses:

(1) Temperature Sense – You have about 30,000 warm sensation points and 250,000 cold sensation points on your body. If you place your palm on your cheek, you will definitely feel that your hand is cold. If you move your hand to your ear, you will feel that your ear is cold. This is because the hand has a normal temperature that is exactly between the cheek and the ear.

(2) Balance Sense – The three semicircular canals in your ear are the organs that manage this sense and also enable you to maintain stability when walking.

(3) Hunger Sense – Hunger is different from appetite. It is a real sense caused by the contraction of the stomach wall muscles.

(4) Muscle Sense – When you pick up an object from the ground, your muscles immediately judge the weight of the object through your brain. When you judge the distance to an object, the contraction or relaxation of the muscles that manage the focus distance of the eyeball tells you the distance of the object. When you want to make a sound, the muscle sense will tell you how to contract your throat muscles to make a loud enough shout without making it too soft for others to hear.

(5) Pain Sense – This is the most widely distributed sense on the body. Any excessive stimulation produces a feeling of pain. If you have any discomfort in your body, pain often indicates the location of the illness because pain is often an accessory to disease. Although the feeling of pain makes us sad, we cannot regard it as something to be cursed. It is actually a benefit to us because when any part of our body is damaged, it is a dangerous warning to us.

(6) Thirst Sense – The feeling of thirst is the most painful feeling if it cannot be satisfied. However, in addition to drinking water to quench our thirst, we can also inject liquid into the blood vessels to quench our thirst.

### My Opinion on "Blood Transfusion"

— Shui Rong

Blood transfusion—I have heard about it and seen it with my own eyes.

But what I have heard and seen is very different from what Mr. Feizi has heard and seen. A few years ago, when my uncle was lying unconscious on a hospital bed and the doctor thought it was necessary to give him a blood transfusion, we did not make much effort to invite three laborers.

Among these three laborers, one was a pale, fat man who had given blood one or two times. The other two were newcomers. During the blood typing, there was no "funny scene" performed. And the selected newcomer only frowned slightly during the blood transfusion. On the other hand, Mr. Feizi's "two coolie classes": one "slipped away quickly" and the other "asked to be exempted from the test", making people imagine their embarrassment at the time when they wanted to exchange money but could not (frightened to death). (It's not that they are not "generous," I think!) It's really "funny"!

But I have not been able to find that the above-mentioned laborer "regards blood transfusion as a very honorable thing" or that he has realized "the greatness of human mutual assistance"; he probably just sells his own blood as a commodity: he gave blood, got some not much money, and then quietly went his way.

After that, I read a confession of a person selling blood in a newspaper. It talked about the low price of blood and the increasing number of his competitors.

More than a month ago, a relative of mine had a blood transfusion because of illness. After he recovered, I went to visit him. He said to me: "A total of 300 CC was transfused, costing 75 yuan, which is cheaper than getting a booster shot." When he said this, his attitude seemed very relaxed. Or is it what is called "taking it easy"?

My observations are limited to this. It's really ordinary! Although it may show our "national conditions" to some extent—the truth of the present, even causing people to begin to doubt the saying that "science has no class nature."

In this society, there are mostly "acts of generosity at the expense of others." True human mutual assistance can only be expected in the future.

### German Paratroopers

— Fang Shaozeng

In the eastern district of Balangbu City in West Prussia, Germany, there is an area completely designated for training paratroopers. They learn how to jump down from heights, how to crawl on rooftops like cats without being detected. They believe that landing on the roof is the most difficult to be detected. They believe that the most dangerous thing is descending in the air, but now they can use a special powder to create a smokescreen around themselves to avoid being discovered. In addition, they also carry special scissors to cut open steel plates, and ropes with hooks to help them jump down from lower houses or streets. The Mauser rifles they carry are made according to the latest designs, with bright forms, even in dark places, they can be freely used without difficulty. Every paratrooper is a well-trained sharpshooter.

10. A Father's Heart

Mei Bao stopped in a huff.

"Dad, do you think I don't have eyes?"

The more Mei Bao acted spoiled and playfully annoyed, the more Qiu Haitang loved her. Before she could say anything more, he suddenly picked her up with his empty left hand.

"Child, of course you don't have eyes!" he said, kissing Mei Bao's little face incessantly. "Didn't you see how big this umbrella is? If we walk shoulder to shoulder, it will cover you, but it won't cover me. If we don't want everyone to get wet, I have to carry you."

Mei Bao originally wanted to break free from his hand and jump to the ground, but hearing what he said, she could only let him carry her.

"You're right, good Dad!" She readily hooked her arms around her father's neck. "...Ah! Dad, your clothes are all soaked! You're suffering like this for me. From tomorrow on, I won't go to school anymore...! What if you get sick again...!"

The life of the father and daughter relying on each other for more than ten years meant that even if Mei Bao was a naturally cold-hearted child, she could not have no feelings for her father. Moreover, her personality was originally the kindest. When her fingers touched Qiu Haitang's soaked clothes, she couldn't help but cry out.

"It's just a little wet, child, what's the hurry?"

But Mei Bao was already sobbing.

"Hey! Silly child, what are you crying about? Look, we're almost at the market town, aren't you afraid of being laughed at?" Qiu Haitang said with a smile, kissing her cheek twice.

Mei Bao really couldn't stop crying.

Qiu Haitang carried her for a long distance, and his arm really felt a little tired, so he stopped, carefully switched the umbrella to his left hand, and then switched his daughter to his right hand. (154)

### Talking About Actors Demonstrating Calligraphy and Painting in Public

— Tianqi

Actors performing on stage should prioritize singing, reciting, acting, and martial arts skills. Secondly, the beauty of their appearance and the study of costumes are important. Since the emergence of modern dramas, stage scenery has also become an essential element. However, since Er Hui (Hui Sheng and Hui Bao) pioneered the insertion of calligraphy and painting into dramas, everyone has followed suit, creating a novel and special situation. In the past, many actors were skilled in brush and ink and could paint and write. Since the Republic of China, it seems that any actor who cannot paint and write cannot be ranked among famous actors. Therefore, male and female actors, in addition to studying drama with teachers, must also hire famous calligraphers and painters to teach them writing and painting, so as to show elegance and boast among their peers. Therefore, calligraphy and painting have become a secondary art that actors should have. Even those who cannot paint and write must hire someone who can write and paint to do it for them. Because actors' calligraphy and painting have become a trend, the success of actors depends on the beauty of their art, and the help of calligraphy and painting also occupies considerable strength. Later, those who imitated it included Kun Dan Xin Yanqiu, who painted orchids on the spot in the drama of Yu Jing Dao Ren. Wu Sheng Li Wanchun wrote "The Murderer is Wu Song" in Er Ben Wu Song, and Yang Baosen wrote inscriptions in the Pig Bajie drama, and Wu Suqiu left her name in Baiyu Building, which all added a lot of excitement to the entire drama. In short, actors' calligraphy and painting have recently become the most common practice, and the inclusion of calligraphy and painting in dramas was indeed pioneered by Er Hui.

### Zuo Jun Writes the Script for "Ah Q II"

— Shibei

Mr. Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q" is undoubtedly a great literary work that has shaken not only our country but also the world. Therefore, Tian Han and Xu Xingzhi have adapted it into stage plays, and they have been performed many times, and the evaluations they have received are of course supreme.

Now, I have received news that Zuo Jun, who is editing new Chinese dramas in Guilin, has specially written "Ah Q II" after "The True Story of Ah Q." Of course, before reading the original work, we dare not judge its cultural value. However, we believe that the scripts produced in the inland areas where the anti-Japanese sentiment is high must be stimulating and powerful, in line with the times, and use Ah Q's life in the feudal social system to stimulate certain people.

### Directed by Fritz Fleck

— Wu Ming

When it comes to Fleck, everyone should not be unfamiliar. He is the German director who recently completed "Children of the World" for Minhua. He has recently written a Chinese-style film script, which is a modern social script depicting Shanghai life. However, it has not been decided which company will produce it after it is written. As for "Children of the World", it is being edited and will be released after the autumn cools down.

Regarding Fleck's past directing experience, I can report to readers. He first studied fine arts and spent ten years of his life as an actor on the stage. From actor, he jumped to stage director, and then from stage director to film director. He directed his first film at a film company in Vienna, Austria, and also served as a set designer and photographer. Later, he successively traveled to Paris, London, Rome, Hungary and other places to shoot films. In Paris, he directed "Daughter of Madame Lhasa", and in Hungary, he directed "Floating Doctor". He directed a total of about two hundred films in Europe. Before coming to Shanghai, the last film he directed in Europe was "Father of Jippe", which was a great success in the United States and was considered one of the best American works. This time he came to Shanghai, and his impression of Chinese films is that Chinese film companies have complete equipment and a healthy awareness, but they are technically inferior, so he has this desire to improve the level of Chinese film technical talents.

Chapter 12: As Complete as Ning Wu Can Handle

Xu Jing said to Zhou Yuji beside him with great emotion: "General, you are the commander-in-chief, how can you take this risk? Let the subordinate go out, repel them, so that the city can be repaired completely, and the bandits cannot get up." Zhou Yuji had no other good way. Since Xu Jing was willing to fight for him, he had to allow it. So he allocated five hundred brave men and taught Xu Jing to lead them. Xu Jing himself rode a silver-maned horse, pulled on his battle armor, held a spear in his left hand, and held a sword in his right hand. He opened the city gate and rushed across the drawbridge. The bandits hadn't seen the government army fight for a long time, and they didn't expect this. Xu Jing, with the heart of dying, stabbed and chopped with his spear and sword, and only cared about rushing around in the bandit army. The bandits attacking the city were the ninth team and couldn't resist it, so they retreated one after another. Xu Jing wanted to give the guards on the pass time to repair the city walls, so he ran forward as much as possible. He didn't know where his courage came from today. The five hundred soldiers under his command also fought bravely. Li Zicheng heard that the government army was fighting and the ninth team was defeated, so he hurriedly ordered the tenth team and the first and second teams to come forward to meet them and work together. The bandit general Guan Youyong of the tenth team came forward to meet Xu Jing in a big battle. In less than twenty rounds, he was stabbed to death by Xu Jing with a spear. However, the first and second teams had already outflanked from the left and right, trapping Xu Jing's army. The third team continued to cover up. Zhou Yuji urged the soldiers to pick up earth and carry stones to repair the gaps in the city wall, and had no time to rescue Xu Jing. Bandit General One Tiger waved his broadsword and fought Xu Jing with all his strength. Xu Jing gritted his teeth and fought desperately. After a long battle, of the five hundred dead soldiers under his command, some died and some were injured, and there were only thirty left who could fight. Xu Jing didn't want to live today either, and used all his strength to fight One Tiger to the death. However, One Tiger had infinite strength, and Xu Jing's spearmanship gradually became disordered. One Tiger took the opportunity to sweep his arm with a knife. Xu Jing didn't have time to return the spear to defend himself. When he used his left hand sword to protect himself, his arm had already been cut by the knife edge, taking away a small piece of meat. Blood was dripping, and a burst of pain made him feel weaker in his hand, so he had to turn his horse and flee in panic. Because it was impossible for him to chase into the city, on the one hand, the retreat had been cut off, and on the other hand, he was afraid that the bandits would take the opportunity to rush into the city gate, so he would rather go elsewhere.

### A Chat About "Wu Sheng" on Shanghai Stages (6)

— Kui Jinchun

Zhang Delu

Zhang Ling's art is certainly not comparable to ordinary Wu Sheng, but recently, as he has aged, he has gradually deteriorated. When he was at the Gong Stage, he was already mediocre. Now that he is performing at the Grand Stage, the environment is better. According to his most prosperous period, he was at the Qiankun Grand Theater, where he once hung his head sign. Zhang is good at performing dramas such as "Luanzhou", "Jizhou City", and "Changbanpo". When performing, he can move the audience, and the loyalty and courage of the characters in the drama linger in their minds and do not disappear. But today, he does not often perform, only plays a supporting role. Even if he occasionally performs, he is not able to do it. It is not as good as the rising stars.

Wang Shaolou The famous one-legged Wang Shaolou, since Wang Huchen's death, has been a rare talent among Wu Sheng. The gentlemen who appreciate music praise him. His leg skills are so strong that he can stand upright and independent for several minutes, as hard as iron and without bending. His posture is excellent, and his attitude is free and easy. All of these are beyond the reach of other actors! Moreover, his appearance and demeanor are excellent. Whether it is a long-kao or short-da play, he performs seriously and hard. His singing is also worth listening to. The various martial arts roles in "Ji Gong Living Buddha" and "Strange Hero Ouyang De" are agile and clean in the use of knives and guns, and the styles are novel and different. He and Zhang Yipeng's various stunts complement each other. Gong Stage has always relied on him as one of the mainstays, which is really reasonable.

Liu Hanchen Liu Hanchen's stage name is indeed a true eight-year-old red, just like Zhou Xinfang is called Qilin Tong. It can be seen that Hanchen became famous on stage early. More than ten years ago, he was in his most popular era in Yantai, Jinan and other places. All long-kao dramas are possible, and short-da was more impressive in the past, but now it is much less so. In recent years, as he has aged, he has changed to singing literary and martial arts whiskers and is also good at acting, but most of them are still based on Wu Sheng. The year before last, Tianchan specially hired him to Shen for the role of Xu Mingxi in "Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes" and returned to the north with fame. Now he belongs to Gong Stage, and the "Golden Money Leopard", "Xue Di Hate", and "Nanyang Pass" performed every Saturday and Sunday are extremely heavy, and the box office appeal is not weak. (End)

### The Object of Youthful Pursuit

— Xin Juan

When Chaplin's wife, Paulette Goddard, was traveling in Mexico, the famous local artist Diego Rivera asked Paulette Goddard to allow him to paint her figure. Because Rivera was a world-renowned artist, she could not refuse out of politeness, and readily agreed, temporarily acting as a model. Rivera also requested that she wear a tennis outfit, and painted an oil portrait, titled: "The Object of American Youthful Pursuit". This title is rather unique. Originally, Paulette Goddard was known for her plump and sensual figure, and the beauty of her curves had long become the "object of American youthful pursuit," so this title is indeed very apt.
