### War Atmosphere Permeates Washington; U.S. Navy on Standby for Convoy Duty; Fleet to be Distributed Evenly Across Both Oceans as Usual; Willkie Speech Calls for Substantial Aid to Britain

Washington – The convoy issue erupted again in Congress yesterday, filling the capital with a war atmosphere, awaiting President Roosevelt's next steps in the "Battle of the Atlantic." The current situation includes: (1) The House passed a bill authorizing the President to use 100 foreign ships; (2) Navy Secretary Colonel Knox announced the Navy Department's reclaiming of the overseas activities of the U.S. Coast Guard; (3) Colonel Knox stated that Britain has made a general request to increase naval power by 115 small vessels.

He also stated that the maritime activities of the U.S. Coast Guard have been integrated into the Navy. Meanwhile, Washington is strongly debating Stimson's proposal for the Navy to fully support Britain. Knox delivered a speech on the evening of the 7th (morning of the 8th, Shanghai time), and it is widely believed that his advocacy of convoy support to Britain is on par with, and perhaps surpasses, that of Colonel Stimson. Colonel Knox also stated that the order to transfer Coast Guard activities to the Navy Department was signed by President Roosevelt. This move includes major vessels but does not include aircraft activities. According to Navy orders, the vessels will be manned by the Coast Guard. (United Press, 7th)

U.S. Resolves to Use Vast Resources to Safeguard British Naval Power; Important Speech by Colonel Knox

Washington – Navy Secretary Colonel Knox declared last night that all of America's vast resources, including manpower, are being used for a supreme purpose: to ensure that the British naval power, which has protected us in the Atlantic for a century, is not destroyed by a nation that we openly recognize as our enemy. Knox also warned that if this shipping lane is not maintained, the United States will face a disaster. If that happens, we will face a naval power infinitely superior to our own. At that time, we will have to defend the entire Western Hemisphere with only the U.S. fleet and fight against the superior navies of Germany, Italy, and France. Knox pointed out that the United States must be able to control both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as a guarantee for America. He added that the United States' ability to control these two oceans in the past has largely been due to the strength of its ally, Britain. One of the factors that has allowed us to develop to our current state is the deadly danger, and the current threat to the British Navy is also our danger. Once British naval power in the Atlantic is destroyed, danger will come, and perhaps none of the men and women listening to my speech today will be able to avoid it. And this danger will be far greater than you can imagine. That is why some people familiar with the situation attach particular importance to this danger, and it is why the United States is mobilizing all of its vast financial, material, trade, manpower, and production resources for a supreme purpose. Knox delivered this speech at a conference of book publishers. British Ambassador Halifax also gave a speech, but he did not mention the international situation. (United Press, 8th)

New York – Republican leader Willkie called for less talk and more action on the issue of aid to Britain yesterday. Speaking at a meeting in Madison Square Garden, he said, "We love peace deeply, but we cannot close our eyes to all the arduous struggles around us. However, if we only shout about peace but fail to achieve it, and the arduous struggle has already reached our doorstep, we can no longer close our eyes. Because the only free nation in Europe has also been defeated, the most important thing now is to safely transport the increased output of American factories to Britain. In this way, Britain can not only sustain its nation but also achieve victory. I don't want to talk too much or shout popular terms. At the same time, whether we advocate using naval escorts, patrols, or air cover, or even transporting everything to Britain at once, we must do less talking and more action." (United Press, 8th)

### U.S. Plans to Increase Magnesium and Aluminum Production; Massive Manufacturing of Bombers; Automobile Production to be Suspended

Editorial

### American Convoy and Japan

Regarding the recent future of the Far Eastern situation, yesterday's editorial explained that while the current situation appears calm, it still conceals underlying dangers. Its development depends on the overall international changes. The so-called "overall international" is not singular but plural, making it difficult to choose any single aspect as the linchpin or sole focus. These changes may be indicated by signs or traced by clues, but both are uncertain. The outcome of multifaceted turbulence and twists cannot be determined by a fixed formula. Even instigators find it difficult to control outcomes beforehand. Japan, having meticulously initiated its aggression against China, believed it could take whatever it wanted. However, China has dragged it down for four years. Now, Japan is forced to set a goal of resolving the "China Incident," envisioning an ideal state, but in reality, it wants to stop but cannot. Similarly, the Axis powers in Europe, initially achieving planned and overwhelming victories, suffered a setback in the Balkans, necessitating military intervention. To date, they have been unable to launch a direct attack on Britain. Furthermore, the signing of the Tripartite Pact aimed to promote the so-called New Order and sway all nations. However, the picture of the New Order is only drawn within the scope of their military occupation. Local developments have often gone against their wishes, so how can the overall international changes be grasped? Past episodes have been unexpected, so how can future ripples be predicted? Ultimately, success or failure is determined by an irresistible iron rule. The progress of human civilization will follow the Earth's revolution and rotation, never reversing. However, the accompanying storms and rains are constantly changing, creating a kaleidoscope of phenomena.

In the Far East, Japan is trying to sell its storms and rains. According to a Tokyo dispatch yesterday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that when Matsuoka visited Berlin, the German side never requested Japan's assistance in the European war. This creates a completely different facade from what was agreed upon in Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact. It also expressed a seemingly fearless view that American aid would not be enough to save Britain. However, it failed to explain or conceal why Germany was enraged by American aid to Britain. The spokesperson vaguely stated that if the Axis powers were attacked, Japan would be forced to fulfill its obligations, leading to an unexpected Japanese-American war. This implied a willingness to take military action against the U.S. However, what he called "unexpected" is precisely what he fears the most. In short, Japan is hinting at its ambiguous relationship with the Tripartite Pact, which can be true or false. At the same time, it is holding up the paper treaty, hoping to sell it for a good price. On one hand, it curses and condemns Britain's inevitable defeat and praises Germany's inevitable victory, fulfilling its duty as an ally. On the other hand, it is acting aggressively, but in reality, it only wants to use this as a bargaining chip to support those in the U.S. who oppose the convoy plan in preparation for the U.S.'s armed convoy. It is true that the U.S.'s aid in military supplies and equipment to democratic countries has great significance. However, it is crucial that we have the U.S. escort this aid to the war zones. The significance of aid lies in doing one's best. The significance of convoy duty lies not only in doing one's best but also in seeking objective effectiveness for friendly countries. This means taking on a thorough belief and responsibility for one's own efforts. Originally, the convoy method certainly had its possible most serious reactions and had certainly undergone the most serious considerations by the U.S. authorities. From what Army Secretary Stimson and Navy Secretary Knox have expressed, it is clear that no matter how serious the reactions to the convoy are, the U.S. authorities have made up their minds to implement the convoy regardless of the reactions. The remaining issues for the U.S. are the maturity of public opinion and the question of timing. This influences the invading countries: If the U.S. only supplies military weapons and equipment, then they will recklessly target military weapons and equipment for attack. If the U.S. implements convoy duty, then should we target the U.S. convoy even more? Should we target the U.S. that is providing the convoy? The invading countries cannot help but seriously reconsider from the beginning.

Convoy duty reaches Britain first, and the impact reaches Germany and Italy first. However, based on observations, the invading country that feels most hesitant about this is Japan, even more than Germany and Italy. Although both Germany and Italy want the U.S. to isolate itself from the war vortex, in reality, Germany and Italy no longer expect anything from the U.S. and have already disregarded it. Therefore, if the U.S. implements convoy duty, Germany and Italy will most likely try to exploit loopholes to engage in attacks while avoiding a direct major conflict with the U.S. However, they will not hesitate or refuse a conflict. As for Japan, it knows that Germany and Italy will inevitably conflict with the U.S. because of Germany and Italy's attacks on the American convoy. This presents Japan with an issue it can no longer evade: If Germany and Italy clash with the U.S., how should the Tripartite Pact be interpreted? Should we go to war against the U.S. based on our treaty obligations? This is Japan's unique hesitation, and Japan's decision after hesitation is closely related to the Far Eastern situation.

Chongqing – Military news: (1) The Chinese troops counterattacking Zhuji are advancing very rapidly. On the morning of the 6th, after crossing the line of Jieting Wangjiajing Chencaota outside the city, they continued to capture Phoenix City (10 kilometers east of Zhuji) and other places. In the afternoon, the Japanese army sent a large number of reinforcements and bombed with more than ten aircraft. The Chinese troops fought valiantly. By 5 p.m., more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers had been killed, and the Japanese retreated towards Zhuji city. (2) On the north bank of the Qiantang River, Chinese troops attacked Fuyang city on the evening of the 5th and once entered the city, killing many Japanese soldiers and capturing several Japanese soldiers alive. All Japanese warehouses and barracks were destroyed. (3) The Japanese troops who retreated from Wanzhi's Nanguan Shengdian were defeated by the Chinese troops on the 5th. The Japanese retreated to Jiulishan, and the Chinese troops pursued them, continuing to gain victories. The situation has now returned to what it was three days ago. (4) The Japanese troops in Yingshan, northern Hubei, gathered a large force of about 10,000 men and advanced in several directions towards the northwest. One force of more than 1,000 men invaded Wu Fang on the 5th and advanced towards Yinjiamiao, engaging in fierce fighting with a Chinese troop unit near Baimiaoshi. Another force of more than 1,000 men advanced from Wanjiadian towards Gaocheng. Chinese troops are resisting. (Dispatch, 7th)

Chongqing – Military news: The Chinese troops counterattacking Zhuji yesterday completed their deployment and began attacking the Japanese army. All forces adopted fierce attacks. The main force has crossed Wachen Jieting Hengshan and other places and is attacking towards the Zhuji urban area. The Chinese troops north of Pai Tou Town are also advancing towards Zhuji along the railway line and the Puyang River. Progress has been made on all fronts. By last night, they had reached the southeastern suburbs of Zhuji and launched a battle for control. After the Japanese troops in Linhai, eastern Zhejiang, boarded ships, there was no trace of the Japanese along the coast. The Japanese troops in Zhuji city, located on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, are trapped and in a dilemma. The Chinese troops have now recovered all surrounding strongholds and are surrounding Zhuji, launching fierce attacks. The elite Chinese troops in the Twelfth Capital are advancing eastward in a roundabout way, cutting off the Japanese retreat route and launching a three-pronged attack. Zhuji can be taken within a few days. (Dispatch, 7th)

Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman told visiting reporters this afternoon that the battles in the mountains near the border of Henan and Hubei provinces are still in their initial stages. The situation should be clear in about a week. Since the Japanese army moved from Xinyang and Suixian on May 1, the central route also began operations from Yingshan on May 5. Although the Japanese army has only dispatched a small number of troops to the northwest, it is believed that the Japanese army has now assembled 10,000 troops in the area, so it is believed that the Japanese army will have new activities in the area. (Reuters, 8th)

Guangdong Chinese Troops Capture Jiazigang

Chongqing – Chinese troops in eastern Guangdong launched a counterattack against the Japanese troops in the Jiazigang area.

The Chinese troops seized a large amount of supplies. Order has now been restored in Jiazigang. (Dispatch, 7th)

Central and Northern China; Japanese Take Offensive

Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman announced today that the Japanese army has once again begun "cleansing" operations in central and northern China. The purpose of the offensive in northern China is to cross the Yellow River. 20,000 Japanese troops are advancing from Xinyang (transliterated) in the Henan border area, and from Yingshan and Suixian in northern Hubei. It is clear that they are trying to break through the Chinese fortress of Dongpo (transliterated) along the mountains of the Hubei-Henan border. The spokesman said that there are two Japanese divisions in northern China that began a new attack two days ago on the base of the Chinese army in Zhongtiaoshan. If the Japanese army is victorious, it may cross the Yellow River. (United Press, 8th)

U.S. to Aid China with Aircraft

Chongqing – The possibility of the United States aiding China with aircraft has attracted sudden attention from the public and private sectors today. The Army Organ Sweeping Report declared that according to recent news, the United States will provide China with 400 aircraft, including 30 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. The newspaper also published a long article detailing the mechanical structure of the Flying Fortress. (United Press, 8th)

### Rumors of Re-Blocking the Burma Road are All Rumors

Chongqing – British authorities here will likely issue a solemn denial of rumors that the British side, as a result of Japanese threats, intends to re-block the Burma Road. The origin of this rumor is that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie met with Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi. Reuters has learned that this conversation had nothing to do with the Burma Road. (Reuters, 8th)

### Sino-British-U.S. Cooperation Will Soon Become Closer; Central Daily News Advocates that the Three Countries Should Form an Alliance

Chongqing – Well-informed political circles declared today that China's foreign policy hereafter, under the planning of the new Foreign Minister Dr. Guo Taiqi, will cooperate more closely with Britain and the United States. At the same time, the official Central Daily News advocated cooperating more closely with democratic countries and taking a proactive role in international affairs. (United Press, 8th)

Chongqing – The Central Daily News published an article advocating that the three democratic countries, China, Britain, and the United States, should form an alliance, stating that the United States has become the central force in the camp of democratic countries, with Britain as its left wing and China as its right wing. The success or failure of each wing affects the entire camp. The Axis countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, have already signed the Tripartite Pact and formed an alliance. In the past, democratic countries were unable to take this step for various reasons, and some elements insisted that peace could be achieved through compromise. The British and French governments once believed that Italy could be persuaded to stay out of the war. Before the signing of the Tripartite Pact, some elements in democratic countries, Liu Yuandong believed that they could persuade Japan to stay out of the Axis. The repeated failures of appeasement have made Britain and the United States realize that this policy cannot be continued. Today, if there are still people who believe that they can induce Japan to postpone its southward advance through compromise and appeasement, they will repeat the mistakes of the past. We firmly believe that Britain's victory and China's victory are equally important to China's struggle to fight for freedom and independence. We hope that the British government and all sectors of British society will understand the importance of China's resistance and not harbor hopes of appeasement or fear taking any actions that may promote Japan's southward advance. Today, Britain, the United States, and China have the same goals and all know the necessity of mutual cooperation. We sincerely hope that they can formulate a definite plan to cope with any eventuality, so that the invading countries do not take the initiative, so that they do not create new opportunities and regions for new aggression and expansion.

### British House of Commons Ends Debate, Passes Vote of Confidence in Government, Prime Minister Churchill Reports on War Situation, 500,000 Troops Defend the Middle East

London – Prime Minister Churchill, in a tumultuous parliamentary debate yesterday, reportedly engaged in a war of words with his accusers. He asserted that Britain was determined to defend the Middle East to the death, winning a vote of confidence from Parliament. He stated that the loss of the Nile Valley, the Suez Canal, and Malta would be an unbearable blow, but Britain was determined to defend them with all the resources of the British Empire and had good reason to believe it would succeed. He added that there should be no rash or pessimistic talk of reducing losses in the Middle East. He then ridiculed former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha’s criticism of the government for producing too few tanks, saying that Hore-Belisha, now out of government, had only gained this foresight recently. Hore-Belisha rose in anger, causing an uproar in the chamber, but was drowned out by the din before he could finish his sentence. Finally, the House of Commons passed a vote of confidence, following the House of Lords' vote of confidence the previous day, demonstrating Parliament's united support for the government's war effort. (8th United Press Dispatch)

London – The British House of Commons resumed debate yesterday, resulting in a vote of 447 to 3 in favor of the government's motion of confidence.

Lloyd George’s Ardent Speech

In yesterday’s debate, former Prime Minister Lloyd George spoke first, quite passionately, saying in brief that everyone supports the government's motion of confidence, but the government's wartime administration has indeed been disappointing and unsatisfactory in certain respects. He praised Foreign Secretary Eden and Turkey's loyalty, but questioned why no mention was made of Turkey allowing German ships to pass through the Bosphorus Strait and into the Dardanelles to seize a Greek island. The government should provide more information to Parliament. Britain is not a naive country and has overcome many difficulties. It will not panic even upon hearing unfavorable news. The remarks of U.S. Secretary of War Stimson are heartening, indicating that the United States understands the seriousness of the situation. However, Britain should not have extravagant expectations about the kind of assistance it will receive or how quickly it will arrive. During the last World War, the United States placed its fleet in the Atlantic, while Japan guaranteed the Pacific. Now, if the United States wants Britain to stand alongside Germany and overtake it, it must do more than it has already heard. He said that the Prime Minister should consider the entire issue of manpower allocation and establish a true wartime administrative council, composed of three or four people, to focus solely on studying wartime issues, and that the Prime Minister should adopt carefully considered strategies.

Britain Focuses on Relations with Turkey

Prime Minister Churchill rose to speak, ending the two-day debate. He first addressed Lloyd George's arguments, saying, "If there was any particularly unpleasant argument in the debate, it was the one made by Mr. George. Mr. George criticized the Foreign Secretary for not mentioning Spain, the Soviet Union, Vichy, and Turkey. It must be understood that this is not a debate on the entire foreign policy. The Foreign Secretary's remarks should be judged not only on what he has said, but also on what he has not said. If the Foreign Secretary did not mention Spain, it was not because we did not receive much information from that area, nor because the information we received was rarely worth reporting. But I do not know how to describe the Spanish situation in terms that would be beneficial to our current situation. There is much to say about the Soviet Union, but I am not sure that saying it would be beneficial, and I do not know if saying it would earn the gratitude of the Soviet government. We can speak freely about all the tragedies of Vichy, but I do not believe that verbose statements will benefit us. As for Turkey, a country whose relationship with Britain we value highly, its actions in this World War are of utmost importance. Mr. George spoke of this country with solemn words, for which I am grateful. There are two points I can mention to alleviate Mr. George's concerns about Turkey. First, regarding the passage of German ships carrying troops through the Dardanelles to seize Greek islands, Turkey had no right to prevent the German ships. The clauses of the Straits Convention can be reviewed. I believe that one merchant ship can be used to occupy an island, but other ships belonging to Germany and Italy can also be used for the same purpose. This is a matter of interpreting the Convention, which is something Turkey must handle. Second, regarding the treaty between Turkey and Iran (i.e., Persia), this treaty is related to plans to strengthen the borders of both countries. We are aware of its details. This treaty has been under discussion for a long time and will now be implemented from April 1st."

Government Structure Will Not Be Hastily Reorganized

The Prime Minister continued, presenting the reasons for the government's vote of confidence to confirm the government's position, and briefly described the war situation in various aspects. He said that General Wavell, the commander-in-chief of the British forces in the Middle East, currently has approximately 500,000 troops. Britain is determined to maintain its position in the Mediterranean and the Nile with all its strength. He believes that victory is certain. The enemy has superior armored vehicles in the western desert, but the air forces are evenly matched. Britain has no intention of abandoning Crete or Tobruk. The rapid advance of German forces in the desert was indeed unexpected by British generals, but the outcome of the war is still undecided. British forces in Iraq are now receiving a steady stream of reinforcements from India. Yesterday, the defenders of Bania broke out and defeated the besieging Iraqi forces, capturing 26 officers and 408 soldiers. It is estimated that the Iraqi army suffered approximately 1,000 casualties. The Prime Minister responded to George's criticisms regarding the government's organization, saying that since the current structure is operating smoothly and effectively, he does not intend to reorganize it hastily. The military operations in Libya and Greece were never in conflict with the opinions of military experts. All decisions were made in accordance with the situation in a united, free, and unforced manner. As the head of the government, he naturally assumes full responsibility.

Maintaining Shipping Will Not Be a Problem

The Prime Minister concluded by mentioning the continuous aid from the United States to Britain, saying that in 1941, Britain would be able to maintain its minimum necessary shipping. By 1942, the construction of American merchant ships would certainly increase greatly. He had obtained assurances from the United States regarding shipbuilding. Combined with Britain's own shipbuilding program, 1942 could certainly be managed comfortably. If it could be sustained until 1943, then all problems could be easily solved. President Roosevelt's announcement of maritime patrols will reduce some of the work for the United States in the Atlantic, but Britain still needs more assistance and can obtain more help in many areas. Some people say that Britain will get all the assistance it needs, but he is cautious about this because British cabinet members cannot predict American policy. It is not difficult to imagine the entire process of psychological transformation into tangible things of a great democratic country with a population of 120 million, once it is launched. This is why Hitler fears the United States and has not declared war on it. The British Prime Minister continued, "I have never underestimated our difficulties and dangers. We are fighting for survival at every moment. But Hitler also has his difficulties. If we remain united, do our best, and help each other like a large family, then I dare to say that final victory will belong to us." (8th Reuters Dispatch)

### Anglo-Iraqi Dispute May Be Resolved, Forces Besieging Habbaniya Driven Back, British Armored Forces Occupy Rutba

Ankara – It is generally believed here that the prospects for resolving the Anglo-Iraqi dispute are gradually brightening. The Iraqi Minister of Defense is scheduled to arrive here today. The Turkish side has expressed its approval of his selection for this important task. People with close contact with Iraqi sources are also optimistic about the possibility of resolving the dispute today. Some even say that if some face-saving measures can be taken for Ali al-Gaylani, the entire incident can be easily resolved. Currently, Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan are all eager to see the resolution of this dispute, and the difficult position of Ali al-Gaylani can also be seen in the orders issued by the Iraqi General Headquarters, which instruct troops to conserve ammunition because it is not easy to replenish.

Somewhere in Palestine – Former Iraqi Prime Minister Madfa said here today, commenting on the situation, that this incident is merely a summer storm that will soon disappear without a trace.

Cairo – A communiqué issued here states that on Tuesday, British armored squadrons and recruited Iraqi soldiers operating from Habbaniya drove back the besieging Iraqi forces, overlooking the positions of the British camp at Habbaniya. The British Air Force continued to attack Iraqi fortifications. On Tuesday, it closely assisted the British Army in bombing and strafing the enemy and attacked the enemy forces retreating towards Fallujah. The Iraqi army suffered heavy casualties, while the British army suffered very few casualties. More than 300 Iraqi soldiers have been captured. The Moussaka al-Rashid enemy airfield was bombed again, destroying an entire hangar and one twin-engine aircraft, and severely damaging several others. The ground of the airfield was also heavily damaged. British aircraft met no resistance during the raid. The Iraqi Prime Minister's appeal for assistance from the Axis powers has not yet been answered. Recent news makes it clear that the Iraqi military coup failed before it matured. Military sources in Cairo claim that there is no large-scale military action in Iraq, only a small detachment of British troops on an expedition there. It is now clear that all Ali al-Gaylani has obtained is the support of a portion of the Iraqi army, and not the support he expected. However, the Axis powers have been conducting extensive propaganda in Iraq for years, and it will take some time to clear this up. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

### Italian Forces Withdraw from Dhibili District in Central Abyssinia, Fresh British Air Force Arrives in Western Desert, Supplies for German Forces in North Africa Increasingly Difficult

London – According to news here, Italian forces have withdrawn from the Dhibili district, 44 miles northeast of Godda in central Abyssinia. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

Cairo – A communiqué issued here yesterday stated that on the 5th of this month, British forces launched a night attack on enemy outposts around Tobruk, inflicting heavy damage and capturing several enemy soldiers. Yesterday, due to sandstorms obscuring the sky, traffic and visibility were difficult, so there are no detailed reports. After the enemy's failed attack on Tobruk last week, the pressure they are exerting seems to be easing. The enemy's dive bombing was most intense from May 1st to 3rd, but it has now weakened. The enemy is now trying to hold the shallow depression in the southwest corner of the Tobruk area, but they have been repeatedly attacked and shelled by British forces. The coastal area is experiencing strong sandstorms, making traffic difficult, and both sides are affected. The British mechanized forces in the Sollum area continued their patrol activities. On May 3rd and 4th, British mobile units maneuvered behind Bardia and Capuzzo, causing the German forces to send troops away from Sollum to patrol in the Sahara Desert to the south to prevent British forces from attacking their rear again. Some German supplies were supplied by transport planes, but many of these planes have been destroyed by the British Air Force, making German supplies increasingly difficult. This is because fresh British Air Force units have arrived in the Western Desert. On Sunday night, the British Air Force attacked the Benina, Derna, Gazala, and Berka airfields, causing fires and explosions. On Sunday night, the Calato airfield on the island of Rhodes in the Dodecanese was also bombed, causing heavy damage and fires. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

### Another Axis Threat: Preparing for War Against the United States, Germany Labels Stimson a "War Merchant," Japan Says It Will Fulfill Its Obligations

Rome – An article published yesterday in the newspaper of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano hinted that Germany was preparing for war against the United States for control of the Panama Canal. The newspaper said, "Germany originally recognized the Anglo-Saxon people's control over Panama, and even recognized the importance of the Suez Canal. However, Germany needs at least to maintain the control system of the Rhine and Danube rivers to build a major position in Central and Southeastern Europe. However, the Anglo-Saxons are not willing to allow Germany to obtain this kind of interest. To this day, this problem still needs to be solved by force. Therefore, these canals (referring to Panama and Suez), which were originally used as avenues for the victory of Western nations, will now become dead ends for them in wartime." (8th United Press Dispatch)

Rome – The Rome radio station here announced yesterday that American ships entering the Axis blockade zone would be sunk. The radio station said, "We are waiting for Roosevelt's war. The Axis powers and Japan are all ready." (8th United Press Dispatch)

Tokyo – Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman and member of the Matsuoka delegation to Germany, Nagai, revealed yesterday that Germany has never asked Japan to assist Germany in the European war. Reportedly, Hitler made a lengthy and fierce speech attacking Britain during his meeting with Matsuoka. Hitler reportedly said that Germany was determined to fight alone. Nagai said that he did not want to speak on behalf of Matsuoka, but personally, he was deeply impressed by the strength of the German army and believed that Britain would surrender in June or July. Nagai said, "I believe that Germany's strengthening of submarine warfare, air warfare, and finally launching simultaneous attacks on British strongholds will force Britain to raise the white flag in early summer. I also believe that the invasion of Britain can be successful. The Balkan campaign shows that the German army cannot be stopped. American aid is not enough to save Britain. I do not want to imagine the terrible consequences after the United States joins the war. I believe the whole world will fall into war, and all of mankind will be reduced to beasts. Japan is determined to fulfill its obligations. If the Axis powers are attacked and forced to the point of no return, and the day that the United States goes to war actually arrives, then the Japanese people will unite and, with a great spirit, will be determined to sacrifice everything to strive for victory."

### France and Germany Establish Agreement in Paris: Open Zones of Occupation
Goods and People Can Travel Freely in Major Emergencies
Discussion Underway to Reduce German Military Expenses in the Occupied Zone

Vichy – An official announcement was made recently that Lieutenant General Darlan, Assistant to the Cabinet and Minister of the Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Navy, after meeting with German military authorities in Paris, has established an agreement stipulating that various goods and securities may pass through the borders of the French occupied and free zones. People in both zones may travel to each other's zones in the event of special circumstances, such as illness or the death of immediate family members. However, postal traffic and letters between the two zones are still not allowed; only postcards can pass freely. In addition, active-duty French army and air force personnel may also request leave to visit relatives in the occupied zone. Furthermore, the issue of reducing France's burden for the German garrison in the occupied zone is still under discussion. According to the armistice agreement between France and Germany, France is responsible for providing a total of 20 million marks, or 400 million francs, daily for the use of the German garrison. There is now a desire to reduce this total to 15 million marks, or 300 million francs. (Havas, 7th)

Vichy – Lieutenant General Darlan, Assistant to the Cabinet, is currently in Paris continuing negotiations with the German authorities and has not yet returned here. However, the government has released the results of his negotiations to the press (see separate dispatch). However, according to political insiders, the ongoing negotiations between France and Germany have only just begun and have not yet concluded. As for the agreement that has already been established, in addition to relieving some of the people's suffering, it further proves that the current relationship between France and Germany is based on sincerity and trust. It is said that since the resignation of the former Assistant to the Cabinet, Laval, on December 13 of last year, the relationship between France and Germany did experience some twists and turns. However, as of this moment, everything has been resolved, and the relationship between the two sides has fully returned to its former state. As for the practical results of this agreement, the most important of these is that various goods will now be able to pass through the border between the French free zone and the occupied zone. This will undoubtedly be of great benefit to domestic commerce in France. This is because the economic structures of the free zone and the occupied zone are completely different and have complementary functions. In the future, if they can communicate with each other, it will truly be a blessing for the nation. As for the measure of allowing securities to circulate between the free zone and the occupied zone, it is also extremely important. In general, brokers now in the free zone will return to Paris as a result of this, which will also be of great benefit to the Paris stock exchange. (Havas, 7th)

Paris – French Assistant to the Cabinet and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Navy, General Darlan, had a long talk with Laval for three hours yesterday in Paris. Darlan also met with the German Ambassador to the French occupied zone, Abetz. However, the content of the talks was not disclosed. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

Vichy – After returning here from Paris, Assistant to the Cabinet Darlan reported by long distance telephone to Marshal Pétain on his talks with German Ambassador Abetz during this trip. Marshal Pétain is currently resting at a villa on the French Riviera and will still stay there for a day or two according to the original plan before returning here soon. (Havas, 8th)

London – Paris Radio reported that General Béthouart has left his private residence near Caen and is traveling by special car to meet Darlan. (Reuters, 8th)

Vichy – Unofficial news from Paris claims that the opening or expansion to the northernmost zone of France is imminent because the exchange of food between the two sides is now imperative. Paris also feels the shortage of food, especially the lack of meat and fats. According to reports from here, the shortage of food has reached a serious stage of famine. Unconfirmed news from Paris claims that the Germans may move their blockade line back to the Somme River area, so that Paris can be included in the provinces southwest of Paris, which are rich in meat and butter. The Germans will only retain a 12-square-mile zone along the French coast and all ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel. As for the French residents of Nord and Calais, they will be prohibited from going out until the war against England ends. (United Press, 8th)

England Deeply Fears France Will Let Germany Use Syria

London – Commentators here are continuing to speculate whether French Assistant Darlan has already secretly ceded Syrian airbases to Germany for use, allowing German aircraft squadrons to fly to Iraq from Syria. Commentators are also expressing concern in newspapers that Darlan has allowed German troops to pass through Syria, enabling Germany to launch a massive armored tactical offensive against Egypt and cooperate with the troops of Rommel, the German commander in Africa fighting in the Western Desert. They are also speculating whether Darlan can allow German troops to pass through the French free zone to Spain to attack Gibraltar. Diplomats also believe that Darlan may also give the French fleet to Germany and conclude an agreement with Germany to open roads between the free zone and the occupied zone, so that food and essential goods can reach the free zone in exchange. However, they also believe that given Marshal Pétain's vow not to attack Britain, France is unlikely to take this action. A British correspondent in Cairo, in describing the end of the siege of Habbaniyah, said that Rashid's troops have scattered to Baghdad and are facing defeat in the first Iraqi War. A British correspondent in Basra said that supporters of Rashid are complaining that the Axis powers are not providing assistance and claiming that Rashid's troops are eagerly awaiting German aid from the sky, even using flares to welcome the arrival of German aircraft squadrons. They strongly argue that Hitler will be able to quickly resolve the Iraqi crisis and force Britain to engage in a long and arduous war to defend Middle Eastern oil fields. (United Press, 8th)

### After Signing of New Franco-Japanese Treaty, Japan Solely Enjoys Benefits
More Than 40 Types of Japanese Goods Enter Vietnam Duty-Free; Other Hundreds of Types Subject to Very Low Taxes

Tokyo – Today, newspapers published the details of the new Japanese-Vietnamese economic treaty signed on Tuesday. The treaty is valid for five years and will remain in effect unless one of the parties notifies the other of its cancellation before the expiration date. The shipping treaty stipulates that Japanese people and Japanese ships will receive "national treatment" in Vietnam. There are more than 30 clauses regarding tariffs, commerce, and payment methods, as well as supplementary documents. Both parties receive most-favored-nation treatment. However, the treaty lists more than 40 types of important Japanese goods that can be imported into Vietnam duty-free. In addition, more than 130 types of Japanese manufactured goods, including cotton fabrics and sundries, will be subject to new tariffs that are even lower than the current lowest tariffs. There are also more than 400 types of Japanese manufactured goods that will be taxed at the current lowest tariff rate. It is also stipulated that in order to develop commerce between the two parties, Japan will purchase white rice, corn, pepper, cowhide, zinc, tin, iron, manganese, and other goods from Vietnam, and Vietnam will purchase textiles and sundries from Japan. The price of the Vietnamese goods purchased by Japan will be paid in Japanese yen to the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the Yokohama Specie Bank will open a current account with the Bank of Vietnam to handle it. It will be cleared every three months. If the difference between the two sides exceeds 5 million Japanese yen, it will be cleared in foreign currency, approximately US dollars. It is also stipulated that Japanese imports of rice may be deferred for 12 months. More than a dozen Japanese trading companies may join the Vietnam Importers and Exporters Association. Japanese financiers may participate in Vietnamese agriculture, mining, electricity, public utilities, and transportation concessions in the form of joint-stock companies. (Reuters, 8th)

(2) Two districts of the Laotian state on the right bank of the Mekong River are also ceded to Thailand. (3) Thailand guarantees completely equal treatment for French and Thai people.

French People in Vietnam Dissatisfied with New Treaty

Saigon – Yesterday, local officials had no comment on the conclusion of the commercial and shipping agreement between Japan and Vietnam in Tokyo, but well-informed sources condemned it. They declared, "We have learned that this agreement is extremely beneficial to Japan but detrimental to Vietnam." Well-informed sources announced that Japan is preparing to extract from Vietnam. On Tuesday, there were eight Japanese ships loading goods in Saigon, but no goods were transported here from Japan. The conclusion of this agreement means that France is only giving Vietnam empty words. Authoritative sources believe that this treaty has not yet satisfied Japan's desires for Vietnam. If war breaks out in the Pacific, Japan will seize more of the goals it seeks. Well-informed sources said that many of the Japanese ships docked here first docked in Bangkok to unload military supplies, and then sailed empty to Vietnamese ports to load rice and rubber. According to unconfirmed unofficial reports from Bangkok, Japan's transport of military supplies to Thailand is now increasing, resulting in more empty ships sailing to Saigon to load Vietnamese products. Well-informed sources said that in recent weeks, thousands of Japanese men have arrived in Thailand for "tourism." There are now more than 10,000 Japanese people in Bangkok. Foreign aviation circles say that in the past four months, every Japanese plane flying from Saigon to Bangkok has carried Japanese officers, and returned empty. At the same time, foreigners arriving here from Singapore declared that large numbers of British reinforcements arrive in Singapore every day, including airplanes. (United Press, 8th)

Chongqing – The Ta Kung Pao declared today that the Franco-Japanese signing of the economic treaty is another step in Japan's southward advance. Vietnam has entered the third stage of Japanese control and has in effect become a Japanese colony. If Japanese troops enter Vietnam, it will be entirely a territory of Japan. The second step will be to pass through Thailand to attack Burma. (United Press, 8th)

### No Diplomatic Changes After Stalin Takes New Position

Baocheng – The Baocheng radio station announced that Stalin's appointment as Chairman of the People's Committee is clearly due to the increasingly tense international situation. Local newspapers believe that Stalin was originally the true leader of the Soviet Union, and his current personal assumption of important government positions is a sign of tense times. The newspaper continued that Soviet foreign policy will not change. The Soviet Union has so far avoided participating in the war and will maintain a neutral policy in the future. The Soviet Union has signed non-aggression treaties with Germany and Japan. There will be no surprising developments in diplomacy. Stalin will probably focus on domestic issues. He has a "flexible mind" and must know the most suitable path for the Soviet Union. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)

Ankara Dispatch – People here believe that Stalin's decision to take office as Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissars Council does not imply a change in Soviet domestic and foreign policy, because the final decision of the Soviet Union rests with Stalin. (Reuters, 8th)

### War Situation for the Week of May 2nd to 8th

Good news arrived. Soldiers on the Guozhehai front in Zhejiang bravely launched a counter-offensive on the 2nd, recovering Wenzhou, Haimen, and Ruian. Now, there are no more Japanese tracks on both sides of the Lingjiang, Oujiang, and Feiyunjiang Rivers. The battle situation can be briefly described as follows: (1) On the first day, the Chinese counter-offensive troops began to act. At dawn on the 2nd, they launched a large-scale attack in two directions, first capturing the high ground southwest of the city. Chinese troops then charged into the west gate of Wenzhou at 11:00 am, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese. The Japanese were unable to hold out and retreated towards Ruian through the southeast gates. The Chinese ambushed them along the way, causing many Japanese casualties, with more than a thousand killed in action. (2) In the Haimen area, after the Chinese army captured Huangyan, they advanced towards Haimen. On the night of the 2nd, the Japanese set fire to the town. The Chinese took advantage of the situation and launched a fierce attack. The Japanese fled in droves by ship. The Chinese then entered the town of Haimen at dawn on the 3rd. (3) In the Ruian area, after the Chinese army captured Wenzhou city, on the north bank of the Feiyunjiang River, the Chinese army then besieged Ruian city. By 2:00 pm on the 3rd, the Chinese had entered the city. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army on the south bank of the Feiyunjiang River also repelled the Japanese near Pingyang city, and then pursued them, recovering the city of Shawai that afternoon. At this point, there were no more Japanese tracks on both sides of the Feiyunjiang River. Overall, the above battle situation was due to the strong morale of the Chinese army and their courageous fighting, which resulted in this victory. It is very clear that the Japanese so-called automatic withdrawal is all lies. As for the Zhuji battles, the Chinese army had crossed the line of Waicheng Street, Tingwuta City at 10:00 am on the 6th, and then captured strongholds such as Phoenix Mountain, Tiger Head Mountain, and Hucun, directly pressing

### Grains: The Public Awaits the Municipal Council's Rice Arrival; Rice Sales Suddenly Clear, and Rice Prices Fall Again; More Than 570,000 Bags of Rice Arrived in April; The Stockpilers' Manipulations Are Utterly Unjustifiable

The decline in the price of imported rice has not stopped. It is rising and falling, and the situation is weak. There is a possibility of a further decline in the market. The joint sale by the two concessions is inevitable. The first batch of 50,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice is already on its way. It is also said that the first batch of Gong rice has been urgently telegraphed for loading. After the second and third batches arrive in Shanghai one after another, the various rice stocks in the market will have no considerable outlet amid the stagnation of customer sales. Therefore, although large households are trying to struggle, they have actually reached the end of their rope. At present, they can only reduce prices as soon as possible to sell off, and perhaps still obtain a small profit. Therefore, after the market opened, floating households were most eager to sell off. However, sales were normal. Because, except for those in urgent need, those who can wait for the arrival of the Municipal Council's rice before buying would rather endure hunger temporarily and do not want to buy this expensive rice. As a result, store sales have cleared, and customer sales are stagnant. The stockpilers are also thinking of releasing some stock. A violent price decline has started again, heading downwards like a waterfall. In an instant, Xiaojiao rice plummeted by as much as six yuan. Rice of the highest quality opened at only 124 yuan, and mid-range rice at 123 yuan. At this point, there were some inquiries, and the market turned flat, before quickly closing. As a result, the closing prices were 135-136 yuan for No. 1 old Saigon rice, 128 yuan for No. 1 Siam rice, 126 yuan for Huojiao rice, 123-124 yuan for Mindang rice, 123-124 yuan for Xiaojiao rice, 111 yuan for Tokyo Jian rice, 102 yuan for Sui Jian rice, and down to 95 yuan. As for other No. 2 Saigon and Siam rice, no transactions were made.

Original bags (one shi and two dou and a half): Yinghua Si No. 1 current Saigon rice, from 153 yuan to 151.5 yuan; April-May, 156-157 yuan to 155 yuan; Xiaojiao current, 151 yuan; broken rice current, 120 yuan; futures, 120 yuan to 117 yuan, all lower than the previous market by varying amounts of 2, 3, 5, or 6 yuan. The total daily transaction volume for current rice was only 5,025 bags because local sales were very slow, and customer assistance was also slight. Yinghua Si had a transaction volume of 1,300 tons.

Since the rice price in this city has risen sharply, this newspaper has investigated the import of foreign rice daily, disclosing the number of arrivals at the port in the newspaper, and then calculating and announcing the total amount of rice arriving each month. Now, according to our investigation, 573,651 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai last month (April), including:

Rangoon 128,100

Saigon 113,323

Haiphong 15,300

Siam 11,804

Hong Kong 305,124

This is more than 114,100 bags less than the imports in March. As of the end of April this year, the amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai in the four months was astonishing, totaling more than 2,278,800 bags. Therefore, the high rice price was obviously caused by the monopoly of unscrupulous merchants. Recently, thanks to the proper control by the authorities and the agreement with the Hong Kong government to directly transport and sell rice, the general stockpilers have begun to feel threatened. Therefore, the market price has slightly declined, and the price of corn has also decreased accordingly. The other day (the 7th), the Zhuhua Company's Zhibade vessel transported more than 3,000 bags of corn from Hong Kong, docking at the Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. It is said that the Rangoon Xiaojiao rice purchased by the Municipal Council, transported from Hong Kong, is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 12th. According to reliable sources yesterday, it may arrive one or two days earlier, which is also possible.

Although the sales of Guomi such as Houbo and Japonica rice and glutinous rice are still not smooth, the market has limited stocks, and the owners are not in a hurry to sell. Therefore, although the market is also affected by foreign rice, it is not as wildly declining as foreign rice. Xijing rice is priced at 142 yuan, Kun Jing rice at 140 yuan, early and late Nanhang rice at 135-136 yuan, Hong Kong white rice at 125-126 yuan, and glutinous rice at 115-116 yuan, slightly lower than the previous market by one or two yuan.

### The Flour Market's Popularity Gradually Weakens

The foreign flour market situation has entered a state of hesitation. Because after the continuous decline in rice prices in recent days, people's hearts have felt weak. Scattered stockpiles have gradually been released. Jinlong brand Kan flour once fell to as low as 32 yuan, which began to attract inquiries from actual sales in this street and customers from the Nanyang gang. The market opened yesterday with a good situation. It is estimated that two or three thousand bags of Jinlong flour were purchased by local customers at a price of 32.56 yuan, and Australian Fenghua Wupai brand flour at 32.89 yuan, and foreign Fort flour at 33.23 yuan. However, the selling pressure in the market was strong again. It was rumored that the Municipal Council decided to sell 50,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice at a flat price of only 110 yuan. Rice prices fell again, and people's hearts turned bearish. Inquiries were watching. Later, the market price fell by 3-4 jiao. The Hua factory's flat-priced flour remained at 29 yuan, supplied according to the original quota by the designated merchants. There was no market for wheat.

### Oil Cakes: Soybean Oil Plummets by Six Yuan

Yesterday, the market situation for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes showed no special changes in the morning session, continuing the potential of the previous day. However, after the market reported lower rice prices, all prices saw frequent declines. As a result, Dalian soybean oil fell sharply by six yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 400 barrels, with prices declining from 180-181 yuan to 177 yuan. There was no market opening for soybean oil cakes as there were few buyers and sellers. The market was completely dominated by speculation. In yesterday's market, under the pressure of long position closures, there were still short selling transactions. Only Shen Ji's futures cakes had a market, with a total transaction of 24,500 pieces. The price for delivery in the first ten days of May was 21.6 yuan, and the single for the first ten days of May to be delivered in the last ten days of May was 22.35 yuan to 22.4 yuan. The single for the 15th of April was 21.9 yuan to 21.5 yuan. The single for the first ten days of June to be delivered in the first ten days of May was 21.7 yuan to 22.1 yuan, and the price for the last ten days of May was 23 yuan to 22.3 yuan, which later became 22.4 yuan.

### Finance: The US Enters the Vortex of War; Far-term USD Futures Lack Buyers

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC exchange rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The black market for GBP/USD eased continuously. This was entirely due to the sharp decline in gold prices, and it was heard that the US Secretary of the Navy advocated warships escorting, which would inevitably lead to involvement in the war. As a result, there were almost no inquiries for the far-term June contract. Recently, HSBC, on behalf of rice trading companies, settled and purchased USD 50,000, causing the rate of 5.25 to ease and then stabilize. The GBP, however, had firmed to 3/25 pence for settlement. In the afternoon, the gold price declined faster, and speculators' enthusiasm for selling increased. Banks had no interest in absorbing. The USD rate of 5.25 suddenly broke out. The selling price for the June contract once reached 5.3125. The GBP exchange rate was stable, ultimately at 3/25 pence. The roll-over only gained 0.015625. The USD June contract was 5.28125. The spot and current month rates were difficult to settle and sell at the above price, and were instead more expensive. It was estimated that speculators held short positions of over USD 3 million in the current month, which they would inevitably have to cover in the middle of the month, or pay to roll over their short positions into the June contract. The roll-over was 0.03125 and 0.0625. The trading volume throughout the day was extremely active.

GBP and USD Continued to Lengthen

In the early morning, foreign telegrams indicated that there was no change in the silver markets in the UK, US, and India, and exchange rates for various countries remained unchanged. The exchange rates officially quoted by the Central Bank were flat. The black market opened early, with bank selling prices for spot GBP at 3/234375 pence and USD at 5.21875, both the same as the closing prices of the previous day. Chinese merchants and speculators initially offered USD 5.25 for the next month, but banks had little interest in accepting. HSBC, on behalf of rice trading companies, absorbed USD 5.25 million sold by Japanese banks such as Mitsui, and the situation became tense again. Later, speculators had a strong desire to sell the June contract, and foreign banks began to show interest in absorbing at a rate of 5.28115. The situation returned to stability. The gold price retreated to the 6,600 yuan level, but was not affected. The closing selling price for USD in June was 5.25, and the current month settled at 5.21857. The GBP had eased to 3/25 pence. In the afternoon, as the gold price continued to decline, Chinese merchants and speculators continued to sell aggressively, offering USD for June at 5.28125 and 5.3125, but banks had little interest in absorbing. Before the closing at 4 pm, the spot and current month rates were still at 5.25. At the 4 pm closing, the current month and futures rates had firmed to 5.28125. The GBP was 3/25 pence. Compared to the previous day's closing price, the USD was longer by 0.0625, and the GBP was longer by 0.015625.

Hong Kong Shanghai Remittance Rate Decreases

Hong Kong, 8th (Thursday) telegram: The exchange market opened smoothly this morning. The exchange rates for GBP, USD, and JPY remained unchanged. Only the spot Shanghai remittance rate decreased by 7.5 jiao to 463 yuan (the closing price yesterday afternoon rose to 463.75 yuan). At 11:30, it stabilized. The spot USD increased by 0.0625 to 24.3125. There were no other changes.

Tianjin GBP and USD Both Increase

Tianjin, 8th (Thursday) telegram: The exchange market opened eased this morning. The London cable transfer rate increased by 0.015625 to 3/28125 pence. The New York cable transfer rate increased by 0.03125 to 5.3125. The Shanghai remittance rate remained unchanged, still at 99.25 yuan. The black market for "Joint Banknotes" was cheaper by 0.38 yuan, at 50.088 yuan.

### Amid a Chorus of Selling, the Gold Price Fell Sharply

Yesterday's black market price of gold saw a resurgence of declines. From morning to night, the price was constantly retreating in a roundabout way, breaking into the 6,600 yuan mark. People's hearts were unusually weak, with widespread rumors that the US Secretary of the Navy was also advocating for warships to provide escorts, leading to expectations of entanglement in the vortex. The foreign exchange rate eased sharply, and there was no demand for the far-term USD, with the price exceeding the 5.25 mark that speculators had been looking at. Therefore, although there were large short-covering orders from remittance houses such as Dafeng and gold shops such as Deda, each purchasing over 10,000 taels, the selling pressure from securities firms such as Yida, Tongkangyong, Zhifu, Chida, Hengji, Mingfeng, Yiyi, Decheng, and Xinyuan was intense. Supply and demand remained disparate, and the price fell sharply by 98 yuan, from the morning opening price of 6,645 yuan to 6,548 yuan before the evening closing. After the closing, the price retreated to 6,545 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 70,000 to 80,000 taels. Cash gold shop Chengji first sold 100 taels to Yida, and then immediately reversed the transaction, and Mingfeng and Jishi each purchased 50 taels at a price 130 yuan higher than the futures price, and then purchased another 100 taels from Wanfeng and 50 taels from Xianghe, all 135 yuan higher. At noon, it was 140 yuan higher. Defu wanted to purchase. In the afternoon, Chengda sold 100 taels to Chengji, 160 yuan higher. Later, Baokang sold 50 taels each to Laotianbao and Yongfengyu, 170 yuan higher. However, the futures price was still about 50 yuan lower than the previous day. The price of jewelry gold once reached as high as 700 yuan, and finally closed at 695 yuan. The customs gold and other prices remained unchanged.

Black Market Price Plunged Nearly 100 Yuan

Since the morning, the price per bar (10 taels) dropped by 20 yuan due to the difficulty in selling USD at 5.25, so people's hearts weakened again. The market opened at 9:15 am at 6,630 yuan. In an instant, Yida, Deda, and Yiyuan came in to purchase, rebounding to 6,645 yuan. Xinyuan sold, retreating to 6,633 yuan in sparse trading. Deda still went long strongly, pushing it up to 6,642 yuan, and the market hovered around 6,635 yuan for a long time. At 10:45 am, Mingfeng, Yifeng, Tongkangyong, and Defu sold sharply, and people's hearts were empty, falling to around 6,620 yuan, before slightly stabilizing. Before the noon closing, it retreated to 6,600 yuan. Xinfengyong purchased over 1,000 taels aggressively, slightly pushing up the price. The noon closing price was 6,607 yuan. After the closing, Defu sold aggressively, falling to 6,595 yuan. The afternoon market was even weaker, opening at 2 pm at 6,580 yuan, 17 yuan lower than the noon closing price. Dafeng purchased again, pushing it up to 6,585 yuan. Yida, Deda, and Chida rushed to sell, and the foreign exchange rate was reported to have eased, further softening people's hearts, immediately falling by 35 yuan to 6,550 yuan. Dafeng and Deda poured in huge sums to strongly push it up to 6,570 yuan. Upon hearing that the USD had been sold strongly to 5.3125, Defu, Yiyuan, Yifeng, and Chida sold again, retreating to 6,548 yuan, which was purchased by Deda and Dafeng, rising to 6,565 yuan. At the 4 pm closing, the price retreated again to 6,552 yuan, 98 yuan lower than the previous day's noon closing price. Based on the USD settlement price of 5.28125 for May, the calculated price was 6,594 yuan, a difference of 42 yuan. The fluctuation for the day was 97 yuan. After the closing, it dropped to 6,545 yuan. The selling price of this brand of cash gold was 190 yuan higher than the black market futures price, and the purchase price was 60 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the current standard gold.

Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Changed Three Times

The exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael in silver shops: Datongxing and Xintongxing increased by 5 yuan at 10 am, to 700 yuan. At 2 pm, it decreased by 10 yuan, to 690 yuan. At 2:30 pm, it increased by 5 yuan again, to 695 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by 40 yuan, which was considered a flat.

### The Decline in Foreign Currencies is Still Slight

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Although the black market price of gold fell sharply by 100 yuan, the decline in GBP and USD was slow, ultimately decreasing by only one yuan each. The price of GBP remained unchanged, with the market price remaining flat. The USD once retreated to 6 jiao 6 fen, but ultimately closed at 18 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen, a decrease of 2 jiao compared to the previous day. The price of Hong Kong currency also declined, retreating to 4 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen in the evening market. There were no changes in the prices of Japanese and Korean currencies. The former remained at 2 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen, and the latter remained at the original price of 1 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen.

### Securities: It is Difficult for Domestic Bonds to Rise and Fall

Yesterday's black market for government bonds was still in a listless and weak state. Although there were many participants in the first market gathering, they were very slack. During the market hours, most of them did not enter the market to trade, but stood by and watched. It can be seen that both the long and short sides were very persistent. Therefore, it was difficult for the market to rise, and it was also difficult for it to fall. It was necessary to wait for a strong change in the environment, a shock to people's hearts, before the market situation would fluctuate. Currently, we are still waiting for the opportunity. Yesterday morning, Shunchang purchased, and Yitai Tongkang also purchased. Lianyi Hongda and Lianhe sold, with more selling than buying. In the afternoon, Tongkang continued to purchase, and Xinyuan also had needs. Hengkang, Jiucheng, and Hengfu all sold, still in a situation of oversupply. Therefore, the result was still a small decrease of 1.5 jiao to 5.5 jiao. There was no change in Class A. The transaction volume was approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

In stock trading, 100 shares of Nanyang Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 20 yuan 7.5 jiao.

The opening of the stock market at the Public Industry Assembly Hall maintained the original price unchanged. However, due to the widespread rumors of negative news, the buying lineup suddenly shook, and the prices of various stocks began to decline. The selling pressure intensified in the afternoon. Although the closing price rebounded slightly, the overall trend remained soft.

London, 7th (Wednesday) telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and stocks of various British companies in the Far East were flat. Only the price of HSBC Bank's British registration continued to rise by 0.5 GBP, to 71.5 GBP. There were no other changes.

### Yarn and Cotton: Large Players Painfully Cut Losses; Yarn Prices Fall Straight Down; Shuangma Has Entered the 540 Yuan Mark

The yarn market, which had risen day by day, declined again yesterday. This was because the situation in the Pacific was tense, the foreign exchange rate was lengthened, the standard gold price fell sharply, and at the same time, there were very few actual transactions. As a result, those who had purchased at high prices were uneasy and came out of the cage. As for the floating longs, seeing the unfavorable environment, they painfully cut their positions. The market price went downstream. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,571 yuan, and the low price was 1,546 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,541 yuan. The securities firms picked up the shorts and returned to 1,546 yuan. However, a certain major speculator cut 1,000 bales of orders limited at 1,540 yuan, falling into the 540 yuan mark, to 1,538 yuan. Retail investors who profited scooped up, and then it went to 1,545 yuan. Finally, the standard gold price continued to fall and was still tired, and the final price was 1,538.5 yuan. At present, the yarn market has failed to break out of the 600 yuan mark three times, and the price of miscellaneous brand yarn is too low, coupled with the easing of the foreign exchange rate, so the market cannot support it and goes down. Some people say that they are afraid to see around 1,500 yuan.

Shuangma opened in the morning, and the market situation was originally normal. However, Daye Company purchased a few bales, and then people's hearts vibrated. The first session opened at 1,560 yuan. After a long period of holding, due to the purchase by large households, everyone raised the price. The chips in the market were slightly tight, and those who snapped up purchases came to collect. It gradually rose to 1,571 yuan. As soon as the price was high, the standard gold price unexpectedly continued to ease, and the foreign exchange rate was lengthened, suddenly falling by 10 yuan to 1,559 yuan. Since then, the news has been unfavorable, and the market situation has continued to decline to 1,546 yuan. The statistics of the trading volume in half a day was 10,575 bales. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 565 Ningbo 10

Industry peers 10,000 Statistics 10,575

### Cotton Market Ordinary

The current cotton situation is as light as the yarn market. This is because the factory is not expanding, and the recent arrivals are very strong, and the inventory is more than sufficient than before, so the cotton market is mediocre. In addition, the foreign exchange rate is lengthened, and the yarn market is falling. Although those who hold goods hope for a higher price, it is not possible in fact. A total of 1,339 pieces were made open, and the price fell by 1 or 2 yuan.

Brazilian cotton 40 Chengyu 240 pieces, delivered from warehouse

Also 399 Sentai 100 pieces Also

Indian NT 388 Bingchang 100 pieces Also

Also 388 Dade 200 pieces Also

Peng Yupo 319 Xietongxing 100 pieces Also

Also 317 Also 99 pieces Also

Yamula 232 Shuitaihing 100 pieces Also

Also 135 Zhongye 200 pieces Also

Another message from the Shanghai foreign company's foreign cotton transaction is still firm because of the lively transactions among peers. However, the yarn market is still sluggish, and the international situation is also critical. Therefore, the factory has not dared to purchase in large quantities. Yesterday, only Shenxin and Xinnuo purchased a small amount of Indian cotton and Argentine cotton.

The New York cotton market rose first due to speculative purchases, and then fell slightly due to sales by the southern gang. As a result, the closing price was about 22 points per pound lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market rose first due to retail purchases, and then was suppressed by sales from various parties. Then, it rose again due to speculative purchases and fell again due to government sales. As a result, the closing price rose by 3 to 4 rupees.

It is also predicted that the market will open lower by 0.25 rupees today.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Fluctuates

Factory Cloth: The market trend yesterday was unstable due to floating hearts. The opening price of the agricultural market was flat. In the afternoon, due to negative news, the price of cloth suddenly turned downstream. As a result, the price of white fine cloth and fine materials fell by 2.5 jiao per piece, the price of coarse cloth fell by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao, and the price of coarse twill was flat. The price of bleached and dyed cloth fell by 2 or 3 jiao. The transactions on this street were 400 pieces of various cloths, the Zhejiang and Fujian gangs handled 108 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and poplin, and the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled 200 pieces of colored twill, blue cloth, and twill, etc. More than 3,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth were handled in Singapore and other overseas places.

Dongbu: Yesterday, it started to rise and then was tired. The opening price of Longtou fine cloth in the morning was 51 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen. Later, due to the decline in yarn and cloth in the exchange, people's hearts were empty again, and the low price of Longtou was seen at 51 yuan 05 fen. At the closing, it rebounded to 51 yuan 2 jiao. The price of Sijunzi Wahgee was 1 yuan 5 jiao 8 fen, a decrease of 5 li per yard. The spot market will be temporarily suspended for trading for two days (ie, 9th and 10th) due to decoration and painting.

### Sugar Market: Recent Scarcity of Coarse White

Yesterday's sugar market was approaching the tenth-day settlement date for coarse sugar, and there was also a shortage of incoming shipments, with some unable to deliver within ten days, so the trend became tight again. The association's price list: spot 24 coarse white external warehouse 114 yuan 6 jiao to 5 jiao, an increase of 1 yuan 6 jiao. The futures for May 10 were initially 114 yuan, then rose to 14 yuan 5 jiao to 4 jiao, and further jumped to 15 yuan 6 jiao, 8 jiao, 3 jiao, 4 jiao, and 1 jiao, an increase of 1 yuan 3 jiao. May 20 was listed at 116 yuan to 16 yuan 2 jiao and 1 jiao, and then slightly eased to 115 yuan 8 jiao, 4 jiao, 2 jiao, and 1 jiao, and then returned to 7 jiao, 8 jiao, and 9 jiao, an increase of 2 jiao. Dutch red remained at 89 yuan. Taikoo Che Ri B mark was 116 yuan to 17 yuan, an increase of 1 jiao. DY mark was 105 yuan 5 jiao, and HX mark was 104 yuan.

Also, sugar arrived from Java yesterday (8th) with 2,500 tons, and another 1,000 tons were transshipped to North China.

### Coal and Charcoal: Charcoal is Tired and Cannot Revive

Regarding the arrival of charcoal, although the route from Wenzhou has been cut off, the source is still rare, but the sailing ships loaded from Shenjiamen are continuously arriving, sufficient to supply. In this slack season of summer, the war market is tired and cannot revive. Yesterday, Haimen Pingtan charcoal was 17 yuan 8 jiao per dan, and Huangyan charcoal was 14 yuan 5 jiao. The cost of unloading at the wharf and transport by rickshaw is extra.

### Results of the US Citizen Opinion Test: Shanghai Can Be Kept Neutral; Even If the US Joins the War, Shanghai Will Not Be Affected; Japan's Attitude is Hesitant and Has No Determination to Start a War

According to a recent public opinion test of American citizens initiated by a certain Western newspaper in this city, the result is that the United States joining the war in the near future is inevitable, but Shanghai will not be affected. American citizens unanimously agreed with the speeches of US Secretary of War Stimson and Democratic Congressman Pepper, believing that such remarks are the consistent policy of the United States, and the general opinion is that the United States has already participated in the war.

US-Japan Relations Will Not Become More Tense

According to Dr. Mingsite, the president of Zhijiang University, such remarks are nothing more than to make the American people understand the current situation and cope with it. A small number of American citizens believe that Shanghai and the coastal areas of China will be affected by the United States' participation in the war, but the majority opinion is not, and they all believe that US-Japan relations will not become more tense. Because the United States will concentrate its attention on the Atlantic, and its current two-ocean navy does not yet have the complete strength of each, the United States is not willing to immediately launch a war in the Pacific.

Everyone Believes That There is No Need to Panic About the Status Quo

On the Japanese side, they have repeatedly used threats and inducements against the United States, but Japan is still hesitant about the issue of starting a war with the United States. A small number of American citizens believe that the United States' participation in the war will cause the coastal areas of China to be blockaded. An official of a US consulate stated his personal opinion that American citizens here are no longer able to enjoy real protection, so he believes that their optimism is not credible. However, the remarks made by Stimson and others did not imply that American citizens should leave China immediately, and most officials here said that there is no need to panic about the status quo, because they have not received any alarming news.

Shanghai's Neutrality Benefits Each Other

General American citizens such as the famous lawyer Alerman and the former Chairman of the Municipal Council Fankeling, etc., decided to stay here. Fan said that Shanghai will become a neutral zone, and Shanghai should maintain this neutral position, because if Shanghai is bombed, it will be of no benefit to both belligerents. If Shanghai can remain neutral, the commerce of both belligerents can continue to be maintained.

### French Concession Cleaning Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning; Wages During Strike Period Approved for Back Pay; Arrested Workers to Be Released with Leniency

The French Municipal Council employs a total of 1,700 cleaning workers, of whom 388 are responsible for clearing garbage within the concession. After a strike at the end of last month, workers went on strike again at the beginning of this month due to deductions from their wages for the strike period.

Cleaning Workers Obey Advice

The Municipal Council believed that since summer had arrived and garbage workers' prolonged strike was greatly affecting sanitation within the concession, it contacted relevant parties and decided to advise the workers to resume work first. Regarding the deduction of wages during the previous strike period, the Council agreed to pay them. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, 55 arrested workers were completely released. At the same time, workers were advised to resume work first. After this advice, all garbage workers gradually began to resume work from 8:00 AM yesterday morning. All 200+ White Russian workers hired by the Council as replacements were dismissed yesterday afternoon. After resuming work, the workers immediately drove out to clear accumulated garbage within the concession.

French Laundries and Dyeing Shops Still Not Open

Since the entire workforce of French laundries and dyeing shops launched a strike on the 4th of this month, the French Laundry and Dyeing Shops Guild, fearing unexpected incidents, sent personnel the day before yesterday to advise each shop to suspend business temporarily and await resolution. The workers' demands to management include thirteen items. Management has only agreed to a 30% pay raise. It is learned that labor and management each sent representatives to a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss the proposed demands further. If both sides can negotiate sincerely, the labor dispute can be resolved within days. Management, due to rampant rumors in recent days and continued fears of unexpected incidents, has requested protection from the police.

Yu Qiaqing Remains in Chongqing, Will Go to Chengdu for Inspection

It is understood that he is currently discussing methods for transferring Shanghai inland capital and assisting the government in developing the inland region. Mr. Yu intends to go to Chengdu to negotiate business in the coming days and will stay there for several days.

### French Municipal Council Procuring Vietnamese Rice: Over 20,000 Tons per Month; Rice Stored in All Warehouses Not Allowed to Leave the City; First Batch of Hong Kong Rice May Arrive Tomorrow

The Public Works Department of the International Settlement, in order to prevent the smuggling of rice to other areas, had previously announced that anyone wishing to transport rice out of the International Settlement, whether it was native rice or foreign rice, must apply for a permit from the General Office of the Department at 209 Jiangxi Road. Without first obtaining a permit, rice could not be transported out of the International Settlement. It is learned that both authorities, in anticipation of possible problems, have stipulated that rice already transported to the city, whether stored in Pudong, Hongkou, or the central district, cannot be freely transported to other areas. If discovered, it will be treated as smuggling and will be investigated and dealt with according to the law as a warning to others.

Rice Prices Will Continue to Fall This Week

The first batch of rice from Hong Kong transported by the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, totaling 5,000 tons, may arrive here on Saturday or Sunday. It will be sold at a price of 110 yuan per shi. The news of the impending arrival of Hong Kong rice caused rice prices to fall another five or six yuan this morning (8th), totaling more than 35 yuan in the last four days. Rice speculators are increasingly fearful of the actions taken by the Settlement authorities. The general public firmly believes that rice prices will fall sharply again within the week.

French Municipal Council's Rice Transportation Plan

According to this morning's news, the French Concession Municipal Council's plan to transport rice from Vietnam to Shanghai may be completed tomorrow (9th). The exact amount of Vietnamese rice transported by the French authorities is not known, but it is widely believed to be 25,000 tons per month, similar to the amount transported by the Public Works Department. It is heard that preparations for retail rice shops to sell the first batch of Hong Kong rice have been completed, and citizens can directly purchase Hong Kong rice according to the restrictions set by the Public Works Department, but resale is prohibited to prevent speculators from profiting from it.

Profits Are Generous for Selling Hong Kong Rice

It is heard that the price at which the authorities sell the low-priced Hong Kong rice to rice merchants is 122.91 yuan per bag. Rice merchants sell it to rice shops for 133.50 yuan, so rice merchants make a profit of 10.59 yuan per bag. Rice shops sell it to citizens at a price of 110 yuan per shi, so they can make a profit of 3.20 yuan per bag, which is 1.20 yuan higher than the legal commission of 2 yuan per shi decided by the Rice Shop Guild. If rice shops order from rice merchants, rice merchants must make up for any shortage in the weight of each bag. If rice shops order directly from the Liki Foreign Firm, the minimum order is 500 bags. Now, most rice merchants and rice shops in the city are happy to sell it because the authorities have given them generous profits.

Rice Prices at All Levels Continue to Fall

After the rice market opened yesterday, rice prices at all levels continued to fall by five or six yuan per shi because rice merchants were competing to purchase the low-priced Hong Kong rice organized by the authorities, and rice shops also stopped purchasing because Hong Kong rice was about to arrive in Shanghai. Only a small number of rice shops with empty stocks purchased a little, but the total amount was only over 4,000 bags. Saigon No. 1 rice fell from 138 yuan per shi to 133 yuan. Xiaojiao rice fell from 130 yuan to 123-124 yuan. It is expected that this unreasonable rice price will continue to fall to the reasonable price of 110 yuan.

Foreign Newspaper Infers Response Policy

After the Shanghai-based *North-China Daily News* published an editorial attacking Shanghai's black-hearted rice merchants on the 27th of last month, it published another article yesterday, stating briefly that since the Public Works Department announced that it would soon transport rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai for sale to residents of the city at a fair price, rice prices have fallen sharply in recent days. According to the latest issue of the *Hong Kong Weekly*, the price of rice has risen sharply, and the price of rice has been out of touch with market conditions. On the 18th of last month, the wholesale price of Saigon rice with 25% broken rice was 14.32 Hong Kong dollars per dan, or only 68 legal currency, but the Shanghai market price reached 156 legal currency. With a profit of 88 yuan per dan of rice, isn't this kind of transaction beyond common sense? In the past, the general public in the city have made suggestions to the authorities, but at that time the countermeasures proposed by the authorities were too costly, or they said that they had no right to deal with them, and speculators even further displayed their magic hands, so the rice market became more and more chaotic, and prices jumped by dozens of yuan every day. The general public felt that if this continued, they would have no choice but to take risks. Now, the Public Works Department has spent a lot of money to implement the rice purchase plan, which is an unnecessary increase in expenditure, but it is better late than never. It is generally believed that Shanghai is currently in an extraordinary period, and the authorities should deal with all problems with extraordinary measures. It is deeply hoped that the authorities will not be constrained by past rules and regulations in the future, and that all problems should be handled with rapid and resolute means.

### US Navy YMCA Secretary, Henson, Arrives in Shanghai

Mr. Rudy C. Hanson, executive secretary of the National Association of the US Army and Navy YMCA in New York, arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the President Taft and will serve as the executive secretary of the US Navy YMCA in the city. According to Mr. Henson, although this is his first time in Shanghai, he has heard a lot about China in the United States, so he hopes to obtain more materials during his four-year term in the future. Mr. Henson brought no fewer than five cameras when he arrived in Shanghai yesterday, which shows where his interests lie. When the reporter asked Mr. Henson about American public opinion, he said that he did not want to talk about political issues, because he came to Shanghai specifically to work for the Navy YMCA and did not want to ask about politics. Mr. Henson is a Dane who later became an American citizen and has served in the US Army and Navy YMCA for 22 years. His footprints have almost traveled all over Europe and the Far East. In 1922, he was sent to China to serve. At that time, he felt that he was too young to serve in a country with a long culture. Now his position is slightly better than before.

### Fujian Meteorological Bureau to Host Observation of Total Solar Eclipse

The total solar eclipse on September 21st of this year will pass through most areas of our country. Fujian is the clearest place to observe it. The provincial meteorological bureau has prepared everything and is hosting observers from all over the world, providing various observation conveniences. The observation locations have been set in Chong'an, Jian'ou, Zhenghe, Fu'an, Xiapu, and other counties.

### Capital Inflow: Over 500 Million Yuan This Year; Financial Circles to Establish Two Banks

Since the beginning of this year, the amount of money remitted from Shanghai to the inland has increased sharply. From January to the end of April, the total amount has exceeded 500 million yuan. Moreover, the amount handled by commercial firms is not included, which is enough to supplement the shortage of inland capital and make the inland financial circles active. Inland banks have uniformly increased interest rates, while Shanghai banks have reduced interest rates, causing Shanghai capital to continue to flow inland. It is heard that Shanghai financial circles are planning to establish Jianguo and Jianhua banks, with headquarters in Chongqing and capital of 2 million yuan each, which is completely invested by Shanghai financial circles. It is also heard that a number of national goods factories have selected sites in the inland and are preparing to start construction, including papermaking, wool weaving, dyeing, spinning, and ink industries. The machinery has been transported to the inland one after another.

### Today is May 9th: Commemoration; All Circles Strive for Progress

Today is May 9th Commemoration Day. Since the "July 7th" Incident, the central government has stipulated "July 7th" as the War Commemoration Day. As for May 9th, it has been officially abolished. All circles of the city also believe that the environment is special and do not want to overspend. They only commemorate it by stopping entertainment and banquets, and at the same time swear to cultivate strength, teach lessons, and have the spirit of perseverance to strive for progress, strive for freedom and liberation, and national survival. The Settlement authorities will also implement stricter precautions for one day to ensure safety.

### Jewish Refugees Come to Shanghai to Flee; A Czech Woman Commits Suicide by Drowning; Ship Searches for Four Hours Without Success; Possibly Committed Suicide Because of Difficulty Obtaining Landing Permit

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reported that the Japanese ship Taiyo Maru arrived here from Japan this morning (8th), carrying eight Jewish refugees. There were originally nine Jewish refugees on the ship. One of them, a Czech refugee woman named Grant, 27 years old, escaped the horrors of the Nazis from Prague, Czech Republic, and arrived in Japan after three months and boarded the Taiyo Maru to Shanghai. But yesterday (7th) at around 9:30 AM, after the woman finished breakfast on the ship, she suddenly committed suicide by drowning. The crew heard the news and stopped the ship for about four hours to search, but they did not see the woman's trace, so they continued to sail. According to Jewish officials, Grant had a permit to land in the International Settlement. The reason for her suicide may be because she did not have a Japanese permit and could not enter Hongkou. It is heard that the woman and her husband encountered difficulties in Japan when they passed through Japan because they did not have the approval of the Japanese authorities. According to this morning's news, there are currently about 2,000 European Jewish refugees in Japan, most of whom come from Soviet-occupied Poland and Lithuania, waiting for approval to be able to transfer to other places to make a living. About 300 of them have been approved by the British government and will go to Palestine. The Soviet government has recently refused to allow European Jewish refugees to transit through its territory, so the number of refugees coming to Shanghai in the future will be reduced.

### Coal Prices Must Be Stabilized by Prohibiting Resale of Warehouse Receipts

The number of coal-carrying ships will gradually increase, and the source of coal will become more and more abundant in the future. There is no concern for interruption. Moreover, there is a large amount of coal in storage and the amount used is decreasing. According to the actual situation, the market price of flue-cured white coal should gradually fall, and the general chaotic situation seems to be disappearing. However, contrary to expectations, in the midst of abundant storage and smooth sources, the market price has not only not fallen, but has continued to be firm, which is unexpected. Throughout the day, the supply of spot goods in the coal market is not only insufficient, but short-term and long-term warehouse receipts are also lacking. Cargo owners, believing that goods are scarce and valuable, are unwilling to easily supply the market and are waiting for a good price to sell, so the entire coal market is difficult to ease and the general public is still quite firm. In order to find out the inside story, the reporter specifically inquired from various coal industry groups yesterday. According to reports, the city's major coal companies have repeatedly refused to supply the market on the grounds that coal storage is insufficient, and on the one hand, they have not made efforts to recover the warehouse receipts that have been issued, citing that the holders of the receipts refused to deliver the goods. However, they still do not strictly limit the issuance of warehouse receipts, so the market has become a general abnormal transaction. The so-called spot goods are still hidden, and the issued warehouse receipts are still in the hands of speculative coal merchants. These people hold these warehouse receipts to activate the market and take the opportunity to create rumors and raise prices. According to various coal industry groups, it is hoped that the two Settlement authorities will take the following measures as soon as possible: (1) Order major coal companies not to hide spot goods and should supply and sell them to the market separately, otherwise they will be severely punished for hoarding and speculating. (2) Strictly implement the delivery of goods according to the schedule of the warehouse receipts and do not refuse them for any reason. If they violate this rule, their original effectiveness will be cancelled. (3) There should be strict restrictions on the issuance of warehouse receipts, and the original holder of the receipt should be the deliverer to prevent the malpractice of reselling.

### It is Said That the Shunli Ship Will Sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line

Since a Japanese ship arrived in Shanghai from the Jiangbei bank of Ningbo last month, there have been no more ships coming to Shanghai. Yesterday, it was learned that there is a Shunli ship that regularly sails on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and also serves Wan Shipu and other ports. It is heard that the ship has been scheduled to sail from Shanghai for the first time on the 12th of this month, with one sailing every six days. However, the steerage ticket must be sold for 48 yuan. According to general expectations, since Ningbo was occupied, the market has not returned to normal, and the original residents living in the urban area have not returned to the city, so there must be very few passengers coming and going. As for cargo transportation, it is even more impossible to transport goods because the market has not returned to normal. Therefore, it is not easy to restore the original situation of the shipping business.

### US Star Ship Brings 280,000 Bags of Flour

The cargo ship US Star, operated by Moller Line, arrived in Shanghai from Portland, USA, via Japan at 7:00 AM this morning and berthed at the Pudong Gonghexiang Wharf. The ship carried 280,000 bags of flour, which will be unloaded here. The US cargo ship Areva, managed by Fjell Line, left Shanghai after its maiden voyage from Seattle, USA, after staying for three days, and is scheduled to load 200+ goods and leave Shanghai this morning, taking the route to Hong Kong and Manila, and then returning to Seattle along the original route.

Two of the four companies have already applied for considerable fare increases, and the remaining two companies also intend to adjust current prices to cope with rising expenses. It is not clear exactly how much the fare increase is requested, but it is widely believed that the British-owned Tram and Bus Company are seeking a 15% increase in current prices. The new members of the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Department are Arnhold, Carrigan, Liu Shifang, Mitchell, Powell, D.T. Hsiao, Krone, Yajima, Shao Jiaohua, and Zhao Chuanding.

### Municipal Ferry Parts Continue to Be Taken

When the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau evacuated after the August 13th Incident in 1937, it stored more than ten boxes of engine parts of the Shanghai Municipal Ferry in the Jianye Lane of Fuli Road, French Concession. Last year, the Japanese side twice moved some of these parts away, and there were still five or six boxes left, which were still stored in the original place. It is learned that on the 6th of this month, the Japanese side sent military trucks to move all the remaining parts away and transport them to Hongkou.

### US President Liner Cancels Yokohama Route; Sails Directly from Honolulu to This City; Return Trip to the US Only Stops at Kobe

President liners have resumed round-trip voyages to this city, but the stop at Japan has been changed to a single-trip stop. The regulations stipulate that the ship will depart from Los Angeles, pass through San Francisco to Honolulu, and then sail directly from Honolulu to this city.

President Taft Ship Arrived Yesterday Afternoon

The US mail ship President Taft resumed round-trip voyages to this city and entered Wusongkou at 12:25 PM yesterday (1:25 PM new time). It was scheduled to dock at buoy No. 12 on the Yangshupu Pujiang surface. According to the scheduled arrival time, it was two hours late. The reason for the delay was the influence of heavy fog on the sea. Therefore, the departure time from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Luzon has also been changed to 8:00 AM tomorrow (10th). The company's last small boat for passengers has been changed to depart from the new customs wharf at 1:00 AM tonight (i.e., 1:00 AM tomorrow morning).

### Swindling Money by Claiming to Ship Pig Bristles

Wang Xunmei, a native of Wuxi, has been in the pig bristle business recently. He has 421.5 catties of pig bristles worth 17,000 yuan stored in Jiangbei. Because this item is subject to the prohibition, it cannot be transported to Shanghai. There was a person from Zhenjiang named Lu Zhongyi, who claimed that his brother was the manager of the Japanese-owned Da Ya Company at No. 611 Jialing Building, Sichuan Road, and that he could guarantee its transport to Shanghai. So on March 8, Wang signed a contract with the Da Ya Company, and at that time Wang paid a shipping fee of more than 3,400 yuan. Wang then started shipping on March 13, but the entire shipment was confiscated by the customs. Wang then hired a lawyer to negotiate with the Da Ya Company, but the Japanese in Da Ya replied that they did not know about this matter and that the contract was forged. Wang then reported to the Central Police Station, and Chinese Detective Sun Minchang arrested Lu. After he confessed, he also arrested the accomplices Zhang Bailin and Liu Changjun. They were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Fang Fushu requested permission to detain them because the case had not been fully investigated. After being questioned by Judge Meng, he ordered them to be detained for further questioning at a later date.

### Two Young Sisters Steal Cheongsam Fabric; Conceal It in Coats to Escape; Discovered; Girl Steals Stockings in the Da Xin Company

Two fashionable young women from Beijing, Wang Xiuzhen (18 years old) and Wang Xiuqin (17 years old), sisters, who lived at No. 9, Alley 48, Rue Dupleix, French Concession, went to Yunshang Fashion Company at No. 5 Hualong Road (intersection of Avenue Joffre) at 5:00 PM yesterday, pretending to buy new clothes. They stole three pieces of top-grade cheongsam fabric worth more than 100 yuan and hid the stolen goods in their coats to escape. They were discovered by the shop owner, Guo Rongpin, who called the police. The two women were searched and the stolen goods were found on them. They were taken to the police station together. Yesterday, detectives investigated whether the two women had committed other crimes before proceeding with the handling of the case.

At about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a fashionable young woman in the stocking department of the Da Xin Company on Nanjing Road took advantage of the clerk's inattention and stole four pairs of long stockings and several handkerchiefs. She was spotted by an inspector from the company, who arrested her and sent her to the Lao Zha Police Station for prosecution.

### Tram Conductor Colludes in Pickpocketing, Passenger Reports Arrest

Shi Xinsheng, a local resident of Shenjiazhai in Longhua, Xixiang, thirty years old, a cotton merchant, came to Shanghai on the morning of the 5th of this month. He received 190 yuan in payment for goods. At the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao on Avenue Edward VII, he boarded a French tram line 2, intending to return to Longhua. Unexpectedly, after getting on the tram, the passengers were very crowded, and he immediately realized that the wallet and banknotes he was carrying had been pickpocketed. At that moment, the tram was moving, and several people squeezed out of the car, asking the ticket seller Du Delian, number 690, to open the door to get off. At that time, Shi also squeezed out to chase after them, but was stopped by Du, who claimed that Shi had not bought a ticket and did not allow him to get off. At the same time, Du actually took the key to open the car door and let the pickpocket thieves get off and escape. Shi believed that Du was in collusion with the thieves and disturbed the passengers and merchants. He reported this to the French Concession police, requesting an investigation. After receiving the report, the police chief dispatched detectives yesterday to arrest Du Delian, ticket seller of the French tram number 690, and then pursued the pickpocket thieves who were at large for investigation and prosecution.

Recruitment of Russian Émigré Volunteers, Shanghai British Consulate Denies

The Shanghai Far Eastern Times reported on the 6th that the British government authorities are currently recruiting Russian émigré volunteers in Shanghai to send them to Europe to participate in the war. Yesterday, a reporter from Daguang News Agency specifically inquired with the British Consulate General in Shanghai. It was stated that the British government authorities in Shanghai, in addition to handling the registration of British émigré volunteers, have absolutely not recruited Russian émigré volunteers, and there is no such plan. The report is entirely unfounded.

### Fire at Baoshan Road Railway Depot Yesterday Morning, Heavy Losses of Flammable Materials Stored Inside, China Table Tennis Factory Also Careless Yesterday

According to the English-language "Da Mei Evening News," the Japanese Shanghai Railway Depot located at the intersection of Jiaotong Road and Baoshan Road in Zhabei suddenly caught fire at 1:54 AM today (the 8th). Instantly, raging flames soared, causing heavy damage to the goods stored inside. The depot occupies an area of approximately 75 feet wide and 100 feet long, storing a large quantity of

Flammable Materials

such as cosmetics, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, kerosene, rubber tires, automobiles, cloth, and silk. Upon receiving the report, the Hongkou Fire Brigade immediately dispatched two fire trucks to extinguish the fire. However, the firefighters did not know where the fire had started because the fire alarm did not specify it. It was not until 3:07 AM that they discovered the location of the fire and rushed to the scene, finding that the depot was a two-story building. Then they

Broke Down the Doors

and did their best to extinguish the fire, finally controlling the fire. However, the roof had collapsed, and the losses were quite heavy. At the same time, the Chinese Table Tennis Factory at the intersection of Beijiangxi Road and Bazilu also caught fire, presumably due to the workers overheating the celluloid while drying it. Upon hearing the news, the Hongkou and Central Fire Brigades urgently dispatched fire trucks to the burning area on the upper floor of the building. The fire was raging, and the firefighters

Erected Ladders

to extinguish the fire near the windows to prevent it from spreading to neighboring buildings. At that moment, another pile of celluloid suddenly caught fire, and the flames shot out in all directions, causing firefighter number 34 to be burned on the face and both hands. He was immediately rushed to the police hospital for treatment. The firefighters fought the flames for an hour before extinguishing the fire.

### Extortion of Flour Shop Owner, Offender Sentenced

Pan Ruijie, the owner of Ruiji Flour Shop at 122 North Zhejiang Road, a native of Baoshan, was previously subjected to an attempted kidnapping by bandits at the entrance of the shop. In March of this year, he received threatening letters from the bandits for three consecutive letters, extorting 1.5 million yuan. It was reported that Pan was willing to pay 70,000 yuan to avoid trouble, but the leader of the case, Wang Keming, who was still at large, felt that the amount was too small. At 7:30 AM on the 24th of that month, Zheng Huili, a local Qing Communist Party member, and Li Nanlin, who was at large, took a bomb wrapped in newspaper and sneaked to the entrance of Ruiji Flour Shop. Taking advantage of an opportunity, they threw the hand-slide bomb inside. Fortunately, it did not explode. They fled from Qipu Road, but were chased and captured by the patrol detectives of the Huishi Police Station. Together with the suspects Zhang Yangsheng and Fang Jianqiu, as well as the bomb, they were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted them for the crime of intimidation and extortion, requesting investigation. Zhang and Fang were released without further interrogation. After deliberation, the judge Jiang delivered a judgment yesterday morning, sentencing Zheng Lihui to six months in prison, and the bomb was confiscated.

### Lost Boy

At around 11 AM yesterday afternoon, an unidentified boy was found near Tonghui Elementary School on Malong Road. He is about three or four years old, 36 inches tall, and only wearing a red striped foreign cloth short shirt on his upper body. He has no pants, black checkered running shoes, white socks with green trim, and a Western-style haircut. It is thought that he was deceived by bad people and had his clothes and pants stripped off. If any family members recognize him, please go to Guan Jun at No. 7, Lane 412, Beile Road to claim him.

### Weather Report

The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather around Shandong is unstable, the wind is directionless, with localized rain or fog. Here, it will change from cloudy to overcast, with fog or showers, and whirlwinds, due to a small low-pressure system passing to the northeast. The coastal area south of Ma'anshan Island is cloudy, with fog and southeast winds. Also, within the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the temperature in Shanghai reached a high of 83.8 and a low of 60.8. On the same day last year, the high was 74.3 and the low was 60.3.

Educational News

### Shanghai Municipal Council, Special Education Committee Issues Report (2)

D. The report submitted by the Regular Education Committee in 1922. E. The adoption of the report submitted by the Education Committee in 1931 and the procedure for gradually expanding its recommendations. F. The procedure set in 1931 was revised and restricted in 1934 due to financial difficulties. G. The Special Education Committee submitted a report on foreign schools in 1937. Based on the records of discussions prior to the start of operating public schools, etc., as can be seen in the reports submitted later, the basic principles that formed the Council's education policy are as follows: A. The great benefit of appropriate educational facilities to society is fully recognized and emphasized. B. The various benefits of public schools were emphasized in comparison with private schools. This became the determining factor for the Council to focus on operating public schools in 1892. C. It is obviously unfair to set up public schools with the contributions of an entire society to benefit one part of the society while excluding other parts. Thus, the first public school for Chinese children was established in 1904, and a large expansion plan to gradually increase the number of such schools was drafted in 193 in the middle.

Increasing Burden

But on the other hand, it was initially not taken into account that the sole and common responsibility for educational facilities would be borne by the Municipal Council. It was believed that the main financial responsibility should be borne by the parents of the students, and that the Council's original intention was only to engage in the necessary measures for opening, organizing and supervising, and to provide a little financial assistance for opening. Looking back at the time when the Council took over the management of public schools, it was estimated that only 25 percent of the annual expenses would have to be borne by public funds. At the beginning of the establishment of the first public school for Chinese children, it was expected that the expenses could be self-sufficient within one or two years after its establishment. However, the previous assumptions were not realized. In the years before 1911, the Council bore 50 percent of the expenses of public schools. As of 1940, the proportion of total expenses for the entire educational organization had increased to 8 percent. The 1941 annual budget still needs to be

Plans Reduced

The Council's responsibility for educational facilities should be limited, as was solemnly stated in the reports of the 1911 and 1922 committees. Since that year, due to the slow increase in the expenses of public schools, there have been various opinions. Some have proposed adopting an "expansionist" education policy, while others, in view of the difficult financial reality, believe that this method will place an excessively heavy and unfair burden on the entire society. As for the strong reasons in favor of the former, it is unfair that some resident groups do not receive balanced benefits from the Council's educational expenses. Therefore, in 1931, it was decided to find a way to correct this inequality in the plan to gradually increase the number of Chinese children's schools. At that time, the Council had ample financial resources due to the transfer of the electrical part of its industry, and the previous expansion plan could be implemented. In 1934, the Council once again encountered economic problems, and it became necessary to severely reduce this plan. Shi Jing decided that the annual education expenses should not exceed the income equivalent to two percent of the total property tax collection rate. At the same time, it was decided to temporarily not add any more public schools.

Encourage Overseas Chinese

The committee discussing Western children's schools in 1937 reconsidered the financial issue. For economic reasons, and at the same time to make the allocation of educational expenses more fair, it was recommended that the Council expand the subsidy method, encourage overseas Chinese to set up their own schools, and strictly limit the direct supply of educational facilities with municipal income. In addition, it was proposed to transfer two public schools to overseas Chinese groups for management, thereby reducing the number of public schools.

Formulate Policy

The above discussion is for historical background. The original intention of this committee in formulating the first step of work was to explore the definition of the responsibilities borne by the Municipal Council and resident groups of various countries in the field of education. This issue has been carefully reviewed and a unanimous understanding has been reached as follows:

A. Educational facilities, from the perspective of the welfare of the entire society, are appropriate and necessary, and the Municipal Council must pay attention to this. B. The existing Municipal Council schools maintain a high degree of efficiency, at least as good as, or far better than, the schools supported by overseas Chinese groups and independent groups. In addition, the standards established by the Bureau's schools are exemplary. In terms of political theory, educational facilities are the responsibility of the state, in other words, they belong to independent and autonomous political organizations of the same race. The autonomy of the Public Concession is obtained with the consent of the countries concerned. It is neither an independent institution nor a political organization of the same race. Therefore, this responsibility should first be attributed to overseas Chinese groups in various countries.

Secondly, in practice, if a complete municipal education is to be directly implemented for the schoolchildren of an entire society, it is limited by economic constraints and is impossible. This is because the number of schoolchildren is large, the languages are different, and the cultural and political backgrounds of overseas Chinese groups in various countries are also different. This situation makes educational facilities different from other municipal facilities, such as public health, public works, fire prevention, etc., because the latter can have a single and common facility to benefit taxpayers regardless of their nationality. Based on the above, the committee reached a conclusion that the Bureau's responsibility in education should be limited to encouraging and assisting the education groups of overseas Chinese groups, and limiting direct municipal education facilities to a certain scope. This scope shows that due to several specific reasons (such as the smallness, poverty, and lack of organization of any group, etc.), there is no other way to choose other than direct education facilities. In addition, the Municipal Council's responsibility should be limited to certain special educational facilities, such as setting up vocational or technical training classes, etc.

The resolution passed by this committee is as follows: "The responsibility for education in the Public Concession belongs first to the overseas Chinese groups in various countries, and second to the Municipal Council." (To be continued)

### Teachers of Three Schools Successively Request Allowances, Yongguang Started Going on Strike Yesterday, Remaining Two Schools are Peizhi and Jingzhi

Teachers and staff of Peizhi Elementary School on Klenener Road and Yongguang Elementary School on Carter Road have also recently requested their schools to increase their salaries. The former has already submitted a request to the educational authorities for mediation, and personnel have been sent to properly verify and handle it, hoping to obtain a solution. The latter has already started to go on strike yesterday, and relevant parties will send personnel to mediate today. A reporter from Guanghua News Agency recorded the requests made by the teachers and staff of Yongguang Elementary School as follows: 1.

Another report states that the teachers and staff of Jinghua Middle School and Elementary School on Haifang Road also requested the school's Standing Committee to subsidize living expenses yesterday. It is said that the principal is considering it.

The Problem of Xin Huan's Employment Letters Has Not Yet Been Resolved. Although the strike at the Second Private Xin Huan Elementary School has been resolved through the mediation of relevant parties, and the salary portion has been resolved first, the teachers and staff are also well aware of the overall situation and have resumed teaching first. However, the issue of when to issue employment letters is still deadlocked. A statement was issued by the teachers and staff yesterday, saying that

### Orphanage Calligraphy and Painting Charity Sale, Zhu Rongzhuang Donates 100 Paintings

The Shanghai Orphanage in Longhua was founded by Gao Hanqing and the late scholar and gentleman Wang Yiting. It has a long history and outstanding achievements. After the Shanghai war, it moved into the French Concession Mengjiang Hall to continue teaching and nurturing. There are currently more than 100 orphans, who are provided with food and clothing free of charge. At a time when everything is expensive, it is not easy to maintain. Therefore, Ye Erkai, Ji Juemi, Yuan Xilian, Zhu Rongzhuang, Xu Lianfu and other friends of Wang Gong's life initiated a charity sale of calligraphy and paintings at the Ningbo Fellow Association. Zhu Rongzhuang alone contributed 100 masterpieces, all of which were exquisitely decorated, costing thousands of yuan, and all of which were donated. His benevolence and righteousness are unprecedented. It closed the day before yesterday (the 7th) and was very fruitful. It is reported that the orphanage will publish a notice in the newspaper to express its gratitude for the results of this charity sale in the near future, so as to show great trust.

### The Destiny of the Child — Before Parents' Day

— Pei Ling

After the factory smoke stack exhaled its last cloud of thick smoke, the setting sun had lost its brilliance. Xiao Jin ran out of the factory gate in a hurry, carrying a meal basket, and rushed to someone three steps ahead, but was stopped:

"What's the hurry? You!"

"Oh! Sorry, haha, let me tell you, my wife is about to give birth!"

"Really?"

"Who's making it up? This morning when I came, her belly was a little sore, presumably she must be giving birth now!" Xiao Jin's mouth still had a very real smile.

"Then, congratulations, you're going to be a father, good luck, haha!" He patted Xiao Jin's shoulder with envy and amusement.

"Haha!" It seemed that every piece of meat on Xiao Jin's face was smiling.

He soon arrived home. As soon as he entered the door, when a cry of an infant entered his ears, Xiao Jin's heart couldn't help but beat faster. He was really going to be a father. He felt a joy that he had never experienced before.

His wife was lying on the bed groaning, her head still covered in sweat. The child was sleeping next to her, a lovely little face with reddish-purple pores and yellow hair. Xiao Jin thought it was better than any other child.

"Boy or girl?" he asked earnestly.

"Son!" his wife smiled.

"Really?" Although he knew that she wouldn't be lying.

"But, Jin! I have a few words to say to you!" his wife paused for a moment, looking up: "I've been thinking about it for a long time, and I feel like I have to take this path, rice is so expensive, it's really hard to live, it's really hard to raise a child, alas! This is not a good thing, who would want this?"

His wife was exhausted from so much talking and gasped for air.

Silence

The child was fast asleep, the muscles moving up and down; sometimes he would move his body, but he would fall asleep again immediately.

"Then what are you saying?" Xiao Jin's trembling voice broke the silence.

"I say... I'm afraid you won't want to, you definitely won't want to, alas! Who would want to? There's no way! I say... — throw him away!"

"What? Throw him away!" like lightning stirred in front of the broken bed.

Another long period of silence.

"I can't!" — a resolute voice.

"Can't?" his wife smiled bitterly: "Can you afford to raise him?"

This hit Xiao Jin very hard. All the happy fantasies he had on the road were suddenly destroyed, and everything was dark in front of him. He sat down slumped, lowering his head as if a child had received a scolding.

— His wife was right, now, the combined wages of the two of them were not enough for a month's expenses, and they were in debt of twenty or thirty yuan every month. How could they add another child? Besides, his wife didn't have good food, so how could she have breast milk, wouldn't he starve to death! Starve to death! Both of them went to work during the day, who would take care of the child? Hire a nanny? Ugh! Dream on! Where would the money come from?

Thinking of money, he immediately thought of the only little property under the pillow, not even enough to buy two liters of rice, how could he support a child?

Money! Child! Rice! Breast milk! Money!

Xiao Jin's head was dizzy, he couldn't see anything, he seemed to see a child being thrown in the wilderness, a pack of wild dogs sniffing and gnawing, his hands gnawed off, his legs... his head...

Child! That was his child!

"I can't!" he suddenly stood up.

"Think about it carefully!" his wife said in a pleading tone.

"Alas! I can't think, ... how can you bear it, can you bear to have your child eaten by wild dogs?" he raised his voice.

"There's no way! I can only blame him for having a bad life and being born into our poor family! Alas!..." his wife shed tears, but wiped them away immediately: "Jin! Listen to me, go throw him away! There are many days to come! I'll let you be a father again!" The last sentence was clearly to comfort himself and Xiao Jin.

"Could it be that I really don't have the blessing to be a father? Won't you let yourself be a mother?" Xiao Jin stared blankly at the child, who was still sleeping.

"What childish words!" his wife smiled bitterly: "Send him out quickly! There will be many days to come! I'll let you be a father!"

"Alas! Child! Why were you born into my family!" He suddenly made up his mind and picked up the child, staggering out.

### Singing of the Empty City on an Empty Stomach

### Pitiful?

— Juehui

As the saying goes: "Shanghai's hoarding rice merchants are as venomous as snakes and scorpions, as greedy as tigers and wolves." In fact, Shanghai's hoarding rice merchants are also quite "pitiful."

Pitiful can be divided into several types: like starving to death; like living worse than death; like being unable to "afford" to live or die... But our hoarding rice merchants are to be "pitied" ten million times more than these people. Why? Because the most pitiful people in the world are those who "do not wake up until death"!

Moreover, "you" don't understand "us"!

For example, the Shanghai Municipal Council entrusts rice to be sold. A good "lofty saying" that "entrusting the transfer to merchants will only increase costs. It is better for rice shops to directly purchase and sell, so that food households can receive more benefits." However, everyone regards it as a despicable saying that has lost all conscience. Is there anything more "pitiful" than this in the world?

No one "understands," and they don't wake up until death. Therefore, "rice weevils" become complete "pitiable insects"!

But are they pitiful? They are still "insects" after all, and they are still "worthy of death."

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(7) A Cross Drawn on the Face

"Seventh Brother, don't be so rash!" Governor Hu's intention was originally to plead for Qiu Haitang at Shao Wen's request. Unexpectedly, Qiu Haitang had already been so cruelly harmed by them, and Shao Wen's rage had reached the point where he was about to fight his uncle. He had no choice but to change his tune and plead for Yuan Bin Fan instead. "In this matter, ethically speaking, old brother, you were too reckless! By ruining him like this, isn't it even worse than death?"

Yuan Bin Fan did not expect that this nephew of his would become so furious. Moreover, he couldn't forget how mischievous he was when he was young, squandering his family fortune and nearly starving to death several times, all thanks to his elder brother's help. Later, he gradually prospered, starting as a common soldier. His elder brother also became a prominent figure in politics and repeatedly pleaded and lobbied for him, enabling him to rise step by step, until his death, without him ever repaying his kindness. Therefore, in good conscience, he had to treat Shao Wen particularly well. Besides, in recent years, which matter hadn't Shao Wen handled wholeheartedly for him?

"Third Brother, it's a pity you came too late. Now, even if I want to regret it, it's too late!" He said in an unusually gentle voice, "But, Third Brother and Seventh Brother, you wouldn't want me to be a cuckold, would you?"

"How can you say such things, you slave!" Shao Wen still said, consumed with rage.

"But he fainted as soon as he saw that mute's corpse, which isn't what those slaves said, is it? And he later broke off relations with me himself, openly. These people all fully acknowledge it." He pointed his right hand towards the servants nearby. "Seventh Brother, good boy, even I, as a garrison commander, need to save some face, don't I? If you don't believe me, you can ask them!"

Shao Wen's anger subsided slightly then.

"The person isn't dead?" Governor Hu turned his head to look at the unconscious Qiu Haitang, asking without much concern.

"No."

Shao Wen, however, did not pay attention to their questions and answers. (101)

### A Group That "Eats by the Grace of Heaven"

— Zhong Ken

The Chinese interpretation of the phrase "eat rice" (吃飯) is truly peculiar. For example, "eating foreign firm rice" (吃洋行飯), "eating beggar's rice" (吃開口飯), and "eating loafer's rice" (吃白相飯) are often used as synonyms for "occupation." And "eating by the grace of heaven" (靠天吃飯) is just one of those synonyms.

Old women and the like, holding prayer beads and eating vegetarian food in the name of Guanyin, naturally also call themselves "eating by the grace of heaven." However, that is not really true. What they "eat" is actually their son's or husband's "rice," and, moreover, chanting Buddha's name is not their occupation after all. I think the group that truly "eats" by "the grace of heaven" is probably no more stable than the pioneers.

The other day, I passed by some unnamed "temple." Although it was brightly lit with candles, business seemed very slow. The monks were chanting Buddhist scriptures listlessly, not at all looking plump and well-fed. I saw in the newspaper that the monks had requested an increase in "funding," which shows that this "eating by the grace of heaven" is really difficult to swallow. Indeed, with the high pressure of rice prices at one hundred forty or fifty yuan per picul, ordinary people, except for some nouveau riche, can hardly take care of them anymore. The rice price, which is rising faster than Sun Wukong's somersault of 108,000 li, probably makes even the horizontal plaque of "Boundless Buddhist Dharma" hanging in the hall pale in comparison!

On the streets, one can still often see blind fortune tellers, holding children. Hitting steel bars together, they shout, "Annual fortune, monthly windfall!" However, after turning around in one or two alleys, they immediately come out again. In this day and age, who still has the thought of "having their fortune told"? I think, if those gaunt blind people had ever "had their own fortune told," they probably should have jumped into the Huangpu River long ago.

There are also blind people sitting in the corners of the streets, shaking the bamboo cylinder of divination sticks desperately, so anxious that sweat flows from their empty eye sockets, but still no one pays attention to them...

The "One Dust Masters" and the like, who understand the "divine art of struggle," still pester passersby, complaining that their complexion is not good and that they need to use "magic" to resolve it. But no one is willing to take out their wallets, so those "gods" who resemble beggars have to sigh to themselves.

Astrologers write signs in large red paper and post them at the door, saying it is "a year of great calamity." However, no one pays attention. If they observe the celestial phenomena at night, they must first sigh for themselves.

Indeed, "heaven" is about to collapse. The incense offerings to the Bodhisattvas are slowly decreasing. How can they still take care of the group that "eats by the grace of heaven"?

### Brushstrokes

— Jun Rui

Those who advance are those who are good at understanding the needs of their times.

Those who gloat over the misfortune of others are the most indifferent, cruel, and ugly people in the world.

Those who evade life are the most cowardly and useless people.

"Honesty" is the magic weapon for gaining the trust of others; we should use it with caution.

To live is to struggle; do not forget that we are in struggle every day.

Exploiting the labor and happiness of others while enjoying the fruits of their labor is the most shameful behavior.

Seek happiness in work and experience life.

Enthusiasm without a plan is like groping in the dark.

Do your best to complete the work you should do in a day.

### Norma Shearer to Retire from the Silver Screen

— Ying Liu

A Generation of Tragic Performers

Norma Shearer, a film actress famous for playing tragic protagonists, has been officially affiliated with MGM since September 1925, for a total of sixteen years. She has starred in more than sixty films, with "The Divorcee," "Smilin' Through," "Marie Antoinette," and "A Woman of Affairs" being the most popular with audiences at home and abroad. In June 1935, after her husband tragically died of appendicitis, Norma, feeling the sorrow of her own life, intended to retire to the company. Later, she moved back to her hometown of Longueuil, Quebec, for recuperation. However, due to the resolute retention of the company's new deputy manager, Eddie Mannix, she continued to sign a six-year contract with the company. At that time, Norma stated that her dedication to the arts was purely for the purpose of cultivating personal artistry, and declared that she was unwilling to increase her weekly salary or any year-end compensation. The company officials expressed their willingness to accept Norma's well-intentioned conditions. In the past, the large bonuses that Norma herself should have received at the end of each year were personally distributed by her and donated to charitable organizations. Therefore, people in Hollywood generally expressed deep sympathy for Norma's loyal service and enthusiasm for society. As a result, she was soon hailed as the "Virtuous Woman of the Silver Kingdom."

Norma Shearer has a daughter who is only twelve years old. She herself is weak and often ill. Four years ago, while playing on a swing, she unfortunately fell and broke her ankle, which has not yet recovered. Norma loves her as the apple of her eye. Since the ankle fracture occurred, she has become even more protective of her, staying with her day and night. Whenever Norma goes to the studio to film a scene, two maids accompany her daughter to take care of her, fearing that she will suffer another accident. Moreover, Norma personally teaches her daughter at home every day, not letting her go to school anymore. It is also heard that Norma's half-sister, Joan Shearer, has recently joined MGM as an actress. She made her debut in "Romeo and Juliet," and her acting skills are not weak. Moreover, her face has a few clear black spots, just like Norma, which is very eye-catching. It is reported that in Norma's recently starred "Her Cardboard Lover," her sister also assisted in the performance, and her achievements are showing greater progress. Therefore, Norma once said to people in the company: "I have exceeded the age of going to the studio to film, so I can definitely say goodbye to the silver screen life, so as not to be eliminated by the audience. Afterwards, I only hope that the company will cultivate my sister with kindness, which is my wish." The company officials have now expressed that they can fully accept her wish and will give her sister preferential treatment in order to repay Norma's loyal service to the company for more than ten years.

Norma's six-year contract with the company will expire in mid-August of this year. Therefore, Norma personally resigned from the company last month. Although the company officials expressed extreme regret over Norma's retirement, they knew that it was impossible to retain her in fact, so they agreed to accept it. The company also paid her seven years of compensation in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, the two films currently starring Norma, "Her Cardboard Lover" and "We Were Dancing," have been decided to be completed ahead of schedule. From then on, this tragic image will no longer be seen on the screen.

### Peking Opera and Shaoxing Opera

— Gu Mei

Peking Opera evolved from Hui, Han, and Kunqu opera, while Shaoxing Opera (not the Shaoxing "Wenxi" opera falsely named by the "Duduban") is the remaining sound of Yuyao and Wenzhou Southern opera. Peking Opera reached its peak in the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, while Southern opera originated after the Southern Song Dynasty settled in Hangzhou. Historically, Shaoxing Opera is more ancient than Peking Opera; however, Peking Opera, after being offered to the imperial court and captivating officials and gentlemen, removed the dross, retained the essence, deleted the crude, and added the beautiful. In form, it has broken away from the principles of Hui, Han, and Kunqu opera, and in substance, it has lost the inherent ability of drama to subtly influence, correct customs, and change customs. It has become a thing for leisure, pleasing to the ears and eyes, and relaxing to the mind. Shaoxing has simple customs and frugal people, so Shaoxing Opera still cannot get rid of its rustic style. Big operas (martial arts operas) mostly depict loyalty and martyrdom, while small operas (literary operas) describe chastity. This is different from Peking Opera, which focuses on narrative without a central theme, such as "Empty City Stratagem," "The Pot of Injustice," "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao," "Setting Up Camp at Dingjun Mountain," "Stealing the Imperial Scroll," "Baling Bridge," "Ancient City Reunion," "Changban Slope," "Evil Tiger Village," "Jiepai Pass," "Little Shang Tomb," "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," "The Drunken Concubine," "The Pagoda Offering," "Ugly Showing Merit," "Picking Up Gold," "Black Wind Scarf," "Exploring Yin Mountain," and "Beating the Dragon Robe." After the forces of the Hui opera troupe entered eastern Zhejiang, Shaoxing Opera gradually became eliminated. In order to cater to the public, later actors also adopted and performed Hui opera scripts, such as "Dragon and Tiger Fight," "Gaoping Pass," "Yongjin Gate," "Jiepai Pass," "The Yang Family Generals," "Changban Slope," and "Borrowing Zhao Yun." In fact, Shaoxing Opera has a smaller organization than Peking Opera, and its troupe rules and opera examples are stricter than those of Peking Opera. Peking Opera martial arts students also perform martial net dramas, strongly claiming martial arts student painted face dramas, and old students can sing painted face dramas, such as Li Keyong of the Pearl Curtain Village, Wu Han of the Zhan Jing Hall, and Zhao Kuangyin of the Zhan Huang Robe. Shaoxing Opera's plain-faced characters and painted-face characters are divided by temperament. Li Keyong of the Shatuo Kingdom and Jiang Taigong of the Wei River are both painted-face. Wu Han is upright and loyal and is also painted-face. Zhao Kuangyin borrows a head (Gaoping Pass), slays Zheng (Zhan Huang Robe), hides a treacherous plan, and indulges in feminine beauty, so he is assigned a painted-face. Bao Gong is a civil official, unlike Yao Qi, who came from a military background. Shaoxing Opera troupes stipulate that he should be played by Lao Niu. However, Shaoxing Opera has too much feudal color, such as Huyan Zan in "Dragon and Tiger Fight," who is a filial son, but he is played by a clown because he is scolding the master and attacking the monarch in the play (Peking Opera uses a painted face).

In short, Shaoxing Opera's inflexibility is its flaw; Peking Opera's constant innovation is also a bad phenomenon. Moreover, too few plays have a moral to impart, so Shaoxing Opera's performance is more reasonable than Peking Opera.

### A Record of Pan Haiqiu's Death

— Shu Tian

Haiqiu, the eldest son of the famous actor and revolutionary artist Pan Yueqiao, died last month after being arrested for opium addiction. Here is a brief history: Pan was originally from Changshu. He followed his father to perform at the New Stage in the Shanghai Nine Acres when he was young. His stage name was Little Lotus Green. Whenever he had free time, he would discuss with his uncles and fathers, so he knew many plays. He studied young male roles, and he was proficient in male, female, painted face, and clown roles. He was once popular in Hankou. Unfortunately, he became involved in the singing stage and developed bad habits. His voice became very dim. He came to Shanghai in depression and spoke to the daughter of Yi Fangshuo, Little Fangshuo, and Little Mei Yan, etc. Xi Jun, the current leader of the Peking Opera stock of the Rainbow Film Company, also sought advice from him. It has been a year since I heard any news, and I unexpectedly heard of his death from illness. For an actor to end up like this, how can one not be saddened!

(Return of Gratitude)

### Abstract of the Philosophy of Diligence

— Zong Yu

Matter exists outside of human consciousness. If you want to study material life, you must first connect matter and life, and then determine your attitude towards matter. Changing the material environment to seek the reform of consciousness is a great responsibility in life.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 8: Falling Flowers Intend to Follow the Flowing Water

However, there was another matter that made him even more uneasy, because Lady He often sent a little maid to his room to deliver food to him, which was quite attentive, but it made him uneasy. One day, it was the fifteenth night, the bright moon shone on the half-wall, the shadows of flowers were mottled. At dusk, Xu Jing was reading a book under the lamp in the guest room, the door was ajar, and suddenly he heard a rustling sound outside the door, and his heart skipped a beat. Then the door was gently pushed open, and a beautiful woman walked in, with a high bun, a white face, wearing a light green cloud dress, her golden lotus feet narrow, barely a handful, standing with affection, gazing at him, a scent of non-orchid and non-musk assailed his nose, it was Lady He. In surprise, Xu Jing stood up to greet her. Lady He did not wait for him to greet her, but walked to his desk and sat down in the chair, smiling and said to Xu Jing: "Tonight the old man is on a fast day again, sleeping alone outside, not going to my room. Sitting alone, I think of you, young master, traveling in a foreign land. I can't help but feel lonely and bored, who will pity you? So I don't avoid suspicion and come to talk to you, I wonder what you think in your heart?" Xu Jing listened, and quickly said: "Thank you for your kindness, but I am used to being alone, living alone, quiet and undisturbed, and I can concentrate on reading. Lady He did not wait for him to finish speaking, but snatched the words and said: "The ancients said it well, there is beauty in books, does the young master want to get beauty? But there is also beauty in front of you, why bother to seek it in books?" Hearing what Lady He said, Xu Jing felt even more that she was deliberately teasing him. Who knew that falling flowers were intentional, but flowing water was merciless. He was a dignified man, how could he do such a beastly act? It could be said that she had no eyes! So he said again: "I, Xu Jing, have lived for more than twenty springs and autumns, but I don't understand what beauty is like jade or iron, I only know how to contribute to the country with all my ability, hoping to achieve success and not live up to this life, why does Lady He have to say this?" Seeing that he was very serious, Lady He smiled and said: "I don't believe that there are men in the world who don't know love, you are such a young man, really cute, but you don't want to act like a moral gentleman in front of me, it will only make me laugh at you for being stupid! Do you know my heart?" You don't have to be afraid of that old man, he will never know. You and I are happy, don't let down my deep affection. " Saying that, she stood up and leaned her delicate body to Xu Jing's side, extending her soft and tender arms to shake hands with Xu Jing. Xu Jing's face turned pale. At this time, he could not care about offending or not offending her. He raised his right arm and blocked Lady He's hand to one side, stood up and said: "What is this like? I have said before that Xu Jing is a dignified and upright man, and he will never do such a beastly act. Please cherish yourself. Shame and loyalty, everyone has it, shameless and shameless, is a monster among people, please go back quickly, preserve your face, otherwise I will go to tell my uncle. "(58)
