### Pacific Crisis Increasingly Imminent: Britain and America Confer on Ways to Thwart Japanese Aggression; Australian Cabinet Holds Emergency Meeting to Discuss Responding to the Overall Situation; Contents of Talks Between British Ambassador and Toyoda of Japan Not Disclosed

Reuters, London, December 12 - Reliable sources revealed today that, during recent diplomatic consultations between Britain and America involving worldwide issues, a key topic of discussion was Australia's request for a tight agreement between America and Britain on how to block Japan in the Pacific. (Reuters dispatches from London have repeatedly mentioned the Anglo-American consultations, but have not touched upon when and where they took place, recalling reports from last week that President Roosevelt and Churchill met somewhere on the other side of the Atlantic.) Prior to the negotiations between the British and American representatives, Washington and London consulted with Moscow about the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japan's expansion in the Far East. Reliable sources said that this exchange of views in diplomacy began before President Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins, even reached Moscow, and continued during Hopkins' talks with Stalin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. It is believed that the Australian Prime Minister Menzies' sudden convocation yesterday of a special meeting of the Australian cabinet has a direct connection with the Anglo-American consultations. Australia is recognized as one of the democratic countries' strongest defense bases in the Pacific, and therefore is naturally directly involved in the important review of Far Eastern strategy. Australia is quite dissatisfied with the outcome of recent staff meetings held with Britain, and is therefore requesting that the Pacific countries, including the Netherlands Indies, quickly conclude a special agreement to block Japan's expansion in the South Pacific.

Reuters, Melbourne, December 12 - The Cabinet held an emergency cabinet meeting last night, discussing the tense Far Eastern situation for as long as eight hours. Prime Minister Menzies convened this special cabinet meeting in order to determine the course of action Australia should take in the Pacific crisis. He said that the situation in the Pacific is more dangerous than before. The steps taken by the Cabinet are being kept secret, but well-informed sources believe that these steps are directly related to the Anglo-American discussions regarding the Far East. Chief of the General Staff, Major General Sturdee, Air Force Chief of Staff Sir Burnett, and Australian Navy Department representative Lord, answered the Cabinet's call to participate in the meeting to discuss the military situation in the crisis.

Reuters, Melbourne, December 12 - The Australian Federal Cabinet met for twelve hours yesterday and continued the meeting today, considering the overall situation in the Far East, and also discussed whether one cabinet member should be stationed in London. Prime Minister Menzies and several cabinet members support this proposal, but they all acknowledge that political unity should first be established internally. Naval Minister Hughes said that any cabinet member sent to London must have a solid Australian government as their backing.

Reuters, Melbourne, December 12 - Australian Labor Party leader Curtin stated that the war is now moving towards Australia with increasing urgency; every man who does not enlist or receive military training should be responsible for public work; the time has now come for Australia to ask its loyal sons to serve the country. I now, to the best of my ability, clearly tell every Australian that the security of our country is now in a precarious situation. After two years of war, it is now moving closer and closer to Australia. The responsibility of all people is very clear; we must, to the best of our ability, form an army and distribute it to where it is needed; whether they need sufficient weapons and equipment, all those who do not enlist or receive military training can work. The principle of the word "work" relates to major enterprises and even work in the manure fields.

Reuters, Tokyo, December 12 - The nature of the talks yesterday between British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda remains a closely guarded secret. According to the Anglo-American custom of "parallel but independent action," US Ambassador Grew will also visit the Japanese Foreign Minister, but the date is still difficult to determine. In the past two days, British and American diplomats have appeared obviously satisfied, due to the Japanese side's belief that they have downplayed major issues. The Japanese government's continued admission that Japan is currently planning to take actions in both the North and the South may suggest that Japan is fully aware of the policies adopted by Britain and the United States regarding its southward advance. The unwillingness of the Japanese spokesman this morning to explain Japan's attitude towards American aid to the Soviet Union also proves Japan's extreme caution for the time being. However, the implementation of Japan's general industrial mobilization indicates its preparations for any eventuality.

Reuters, Tokyo, December 12 - When asked by reporters today about the nature of yesterday's talks between British Ambassador Craigie and Foreign Minister Toyoda, Cabinet Information Bureau spokesman Ishii declined to disclose details, saying that it did not involve major or serious issues. He also said that he had not received any formal information regarding the talks between US Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Ambassador to the US Nomura. When asked whether Japan's increased deployment of troops to southern Vietnam had been successfully completed, Ishii replied that he believed it had been completed and that, as it concerned military matters, he was not authorized to discuss it.

### Hull Declares Policy Unchanged; Denies Appeasement of Japan; Continued Evacuation of American Nationals from the Far East Underway

Reuters, Washington, December 12 - Secretary of State Hull yesterday strongly denied rumors that the United States had proposed to negotiate with Japan if it withdrew from the Axis powers. He also said that the State Department is studying the issue of evacuating American nationals from the Far East, especially impoverished Americans in Shanghai. Hull also urged Congress at a press conference to approve the extension of military service terms. Regarding the rumors that Washington had made a proposal to Japan, the widely read "Washington Merry-Go-Round" column gave it prominent coverage. According to the report, this proposal from Washington was conveyed by Undersecretary of State Welles to Ambassador Nomura. Hull strongly denied this, saying that the US attitude is no different from that of July 1937, when the State Department sent a note to Tokyo condemning Japan's actions, calling them aggressive acts of destruction. Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that the United States is considering all possible options for evacuating American nationals from the Far East, including a large number of those struggling in Shanghai. Hull did not say whether special ships would be sent to evacuate nationals who could not afford to buy tickets, but he told reporters that the "President Coolidge" was carrying passengers in Shanghai today. The Secretary of State said that the State Department was aware that some Americans in Shanghai could not afford tickets, so he was studying the situation. Hull also said at a press conference that he had heard nothing about rumors that the United States would try to improve relations with Tokyo if Japan abandoned the Axis powers. He said that any such improvement in relations must be based on the establishment of a peaceful order in the Far East, an order that the United States had outlined to Japan in a note in 1937. The Secretary of State indicated that he may meet with Duff Cooper, former British Minister of Information, who is now traveling to Singapore via the United States to head British Far Eastern affairs. Cooper arrived in New York yesterday. Acknowledging that Hull and Cooper will discuss the Far Eastern situation, Hull declined to further criticize Vichy's attitude towards Franco-German cooperation in Africa. He said that if Congress refused to approve the extension of the army service term, it would have "the most adverse psychological impact" on Americans in the international situation, and that if Congress did so, it would not only harm the government's credibility overseas, but would also have a serious impact on the actual situation. It should be noted that the Senate had previously approved the extension of military service by eighteen months, and the bill is now awaiting passage by the House.

### US Far East Air Force Commander Inspects Various Locations in Southeast Asia; Holds Discussions with Dutch and Australian Military Officials

Reuters, Batavia, December 12 - Commander of the US Far East Air Force, Major General Clagett, held lengthy talks today with Dutch and Australian military officials inside the military and political affairs department of the Netherlands Indies. Clagett arrived here from Singapore with four US Army officers and will depart for Manila tomorrow. After the talks, Clagett told reporters that his trip to Singapore and Java was just to take a look around. He had heard very little about the ABCD alliance before arriving in Singapore. His visit to Java was to inspect how to facilitate the transport of military supplies to the Netherlands Indies and Singapore, it was reported. It is understood that the Dutch hope to obtain from the United States in the near future 600 fast, small military vehicles that can travel on rugged ground and can carry artillery.

International News Service, Melbourne, December 12 - The Australian Cabinet adjourned today after meeting for twelve hours. It is rumored that the Labor Party will be invited to form a coalition government with the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. Australian Prime Minister Menzies said that Australia has no intention of encircling Japan, "but Australia's defense of its own security is a duty that Australia must fulfill."

### Britain and America Fully Prepared to Deal with the South Pacific Crisis; British Newspapers Warn Japan

Reuters, London, December 12 - Editorials in today's "Daily Telegraph" and "Daily Mail" both focused on the Far Eastern situation. The "Telegraph" briefly stated that Japanese militarists imagine that Britain and America are preoccupied with Europe and the Middle East and have no time to care about the Pacific, and dare to imitate Hitler's contempt for Britain and America, threatening to attack extremely important locations of Britain and America, and are confident that their fate is good and that they will risk acting to save Hitler from failure. While the German army is trapped on the Soviet plains, the war in Manchuria will not turn its wheels. The extent to which Japanese militarists dare to peer into Thailand and Singapore from the South depends on their assessment of the resistance force. A large-scale offensive by land, sea, and air three thousand miles away from Japan is a move that those responsible for destroying Japan's strength in China should also consider. The "Daily Mail" said that Japan has not yet made a decision to advance south into Thailand or north to attack the Soviet Union. At the same time, it will probably make various false threats in both directions. It should be known that those who hear these threats are now making final preparations to jointly reject this attack, not just issuing joint warnings. Whether diplomatically or militarily, the United States will take the lead in any action in the Pacific. Britain and Australia are prepared to take necessary actions to protect their interests. Hitler must think that this is the best time for Japan to act. When the German army encounters a strong enemy in the Soviet Union, Japan's activities in the Pacific not only restrain the Soviet army, but also hinder the transport of supplies from the United States to Britain and the Soviet Union. Hitler thinks this way, and Japan may also think this way, but we dare to say that the price of this action by Japan is extremely high and the final victory is impossible.

### Japanese Nationals in the Netherlands Indies and Malaya Retreat One After Another

Reuters, Singapore, December 12 - Japanese nationals in Malaya, due to the commercial stagnation following the freezing order, are being dismissed by commercial firms, and are now leaving the country to go to Rangoon. It is reported that they have requested the Japanese government to send special ships to transport the 300 Japanese nationals here out of the country.

Reuters, Batavia, December 12 - The increasing number of Japanese women and children recently retreating from the Netherlands Indies back to their home country can be taken as evidence that the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense. Another group set off yesterday. As for the retreat of Japanese men, so far it is limited to representatives of Japanese commercial firms affected by the freezing measures.

### Japan and France Will Send Special Envoys to Vietnam to Strengthen Japanese-Vietnamese Ties; Thai Delegation Arrives in Saigon by Land; Boundary Commission to Meet Soon

Reuters, Tokyo, December 12 - Japan will send a special envoy with the rank of ambassador to Vietnam, in order to strengthen friendly ties between Japan and Vietnam. The Vichy government has accepted this proposal. According to sources in Hanoi, this move is in line with the spirit of the Vietnam joint defense agreement signed between Japan and France.

Reuters, Hanoi, December 12 - It was announced today that, at the request of the Japanese government, Vichy will soon send a special representative with ambassadorial rank to Vietnam to handle details regarding the military stationed in Vietnam. At the same time, the American consul in Saigon, Mr. White, is currently visiting Hanoi and will be staying here for several days.

Reuters, Saigon, December 12 - The Thai delegation of the Boundary Commission arrived here yesterday from Bangkok by land, and will soon hold meetings, which will include discussions on economic issues.

### US Manufacturing "Kittyhawk" Fighter Planes for Britain; Increased Engine Power and Firepower

Reuters, New York, December 12 - The Curtis Company announced that it has built a new "Kittyhawk" fighter plane for the British Air Force, with 100 more horsepower than the model praised by the Air Force Department as having excellent performance in combat, and its firepower is also increased by a quarter.

### Thailand Determined to Defend Independence, Deploying Troops on Vietnamese Border; Japan Still Trying to Induce Thai Cooperation

Reuters, Bangkok, December 12 - According to Bangkok radio broadcasts, the Thai Prime Minister said yesterday that Thailand would rather die than abandon the country to any aggressor or allow any foreigner to interfere in Thai domestic affairs. He also said that rumors of British troops moving towards the Malayan-Thai border have nothing to do with Thailand.

Reuters, Tokyo, December 12 - According to a Bangkok dispatch dated August 11 carried in the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," Thailand has decided, in the interest of maintaining neutrality, to order a ban on travel in the areas ceded by Vietnam, and to deploy troops for defense.

Reuters, Singapore, December 12 - The Thai Consul General recently issued a formal statement on behalf of his government as follows: Thailand adheres to a policy of friendly relations with all parties and will not antagonize any country. As for military strongholds, no country has ever made any demand for bases or threatened military action. The Thai government believes that troop movements outside its borders have nothing to do with Thailand. As far as the military situation is concerned, Thailand is not afraid of being the target of aggression by any foreign country. The above is the policy that Thailand adheres to. Thai soldiers will abide by it without changing. Even if Thailand is forced to fight, its only goal will be to maintain the honor of the Thai army and fight to the last man.

Reuters, Tokyo, December 12 - The Allied News Agency of Japan reported from Bangkok today that well-informed sources in Thailand believe that Japan must provide Thailand with a guarantee of joint defense in order to resist British pressure on Thailand.

Reuters, Tokyo, December 12 - Deputy spokesman of the Information Department Ishii said to foreign reporters this morning that Japan has not asked Thailand for bases, nor has it been asked to guarantee the Thai border against a third country. Ishii also said in reply to questions that he believed that no other country had made a request for bases to Thailand, but that a certain Japanese guarantee was already contained within the border agreement. As to whether this guarantee is applicable to a third country or to all Thai borders, he cannot say.

Editorial

### Exhilaration Amidst Solemnity

The tense international situation continues to intensify with each passing day. The atmosphere of gunpowder permeates the South Pacific. As events have progressed to this point, no one dares to predict with certainty the specific developments of tomorrow. However, one thing is certain: in terms of the overall trend, amidst the complex changes, it precisely conforms to the process of historical development. Even if the world must undergo more turmoil and devastation, its ultimate destination will inevitably be the restoration of justice and the appearance of brightness.

People in Shanghai may be particularly aware of this significance. Recalling China's domestic and foreign circumstances four years ago, neither fully met the ideals for waging war against foreign countries. Moreover, the international situation was such that aggressive forces were arrogantly rampant, and the policy of appeasement was also budding. Except for a very few enlightened people, most failed to recognize the significant connection between the Far Eastern issue and the future of the entire world, and therefore few had a correct understanding and evaluation of China's struggle. But China never despaired because of this. It resolutely shouldered the cross of hardship and sacrifice in order to safeguard justice and tranquility in the Far East and even the whole world. In the four years since, China has lost hundreds of millions of lives and properties, and has gone through countless sufferings and hardships. But this is by no means without cost. The war has advanced from a position of absolute inferiority to a stalemate, and the great cause of nation-building has also made rapid progress in the southwestern hinterland. At the same time, the significant international meaning and contribution of China's actions have gradually been recognized by the great powers, who regard it as a major dike to prevent the spread of aggression in the Far East. Both Britain and the United States have formally expressed their willingness to abolish various privileges in China after China's victory in the war, so that China can obtain true equality in its international position. And the various expectations that people initially held, such as the mutual combination of democratic countries, the vigorous assistance of various countries to China, and the formation of an anti-aggression united front, although they have gone through countless detours and twists and turns in the process, have finally conformed to the original ideals. Then at this moment, reviewing this evolving process and tracing it back to the scene four years ago, in addition to excitement and emotion, it will surely leave a very deep impression.

During the Battle of Shanghai, the people of Shanghai suffered greatly from the ravages of war and displacement. After the end of the Battle of Shanghai, they have struggled to support themselves in an increasingly deteriorating environment. However, in terms of material experiences, because of the nature of an international city, it is naturally superior to any other war zone or even the rear. In terms of spirit, the suffering and torment felt is particularly severe, which may be difficult for people outside Shanghai to imagine. However, apart from a few who disregard the country and the nation, only engaging in making a fortune and pursuing extravagance and licentiousness, most are tempered without losing their integrity, and become more steadfast over time. Even in a difficult environment and far removed from the rear, they never lose what they hold dear. From this, the courage and steadfastness of the general Shanghai people can be further understood. Recently, the situation in the Far East has been unusually difficult and dangerous, and there is a tendency to take a turn for the worse. The safety and prosperity of Shanghai are built on its international nature. At this time, it will inevitably bear the brunt and suffer a major impact. The unrest in the exchange rate market and the surge in commodity prices have seriously threatened the lives of ordinary citizens. The future prospects and safety issues have aroused some people's concerns. This is indeed the misfortune of Shanghai and its five million residents, just as the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai was the misfortune of Shanghai itself. However, if we leave aside the safety and well-being of a place and individuals, and turn our attention to a lofty and great goal, then what makes Shanghai feel uneasy at this moment is, on the other hand, precisely the factor that will bring about a reasonable solution to the dangerous situation of the past ten years. The psychology of loving and protecting Shanghai is the same for Chinese and foreign people, but it cannot be pursued with a psychology of appeasement, or even imagine that Shanghai can form a separate, isolated utopia amidst the devastation of the world, regardless of right and wrong. The people of Shanghai should prepare to deal with future changes with the same courage and determination as when the Battle of Shanghai broke out four years ago.

Before dawn arrives from the dark night, it is necessary to go through an even darker period; however, the darkness is only a momentary thing, and what follows must be brilliant light.

### Wang Shijie Delivers Important Remarks; Government Determined to Stabilize the Value of Legal Tender; Organizational Regulations for County Councils Promulgated by National Government; Fully Demonstrating China's Increasingly Democratic Politics

Chongqing - Minister Wang Shijie of the Central Propaganda Department, at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters on the afternoon of the 11th, discussed the current international situation, the impact of the British and American freezing of Chinese funds, and the importance of the organizational regulations for county councils. Minister Wang first said that Thailand's recent expressions have been stronger than in the past. This situation may be related to the successive expressions of British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Secretary of State Hull. However, we still dare not predict Thailand's future. Unless Britain and the United States provide Thailand with adequate and appropriate assistance, we believe that Japan will continue to exert pressure on Thailand, and Thailand may ultimately be unable to resolutely resist to the end. What I mean by "adequate and appropriate assistance" is that its strategy should be even more enhanced than economic sanctions against Japan. Minister Wang then gave a detailed talk on the problems caused by the British and American freezing of funds, as follows: After Britain and the United States froze funds, many problems have been caused in China. The most important ones are four: (1) How to supply the funds and convenience needed for legitimate import and export trade; (2) How to absorb remittances from overseas Chinese so that they can continue to remit them back to the country as much as possible; (3) How should China's foreign exchange management agencies be strengthened and utilized so that the frozen funds do not escape and are used for the reasonable use of the country; (4) How should the foreign exchange rate of legal tender be maintained so that it remains stable. Regarding the first problem, the four Chinese government banks, as well as British and American banks in China, have all received permits from the British and American governments to use their overseas funds to facilitate foreign trade and the business of merchants engaged in legitimate import and export trade, which can continue to be carried out. Regarding the second problem, in the past, remittances from overseas compatriots were handled by Chinese and foreign banks, with different exchange rates and it was not easy to concentrate the remittances. In the future, the Ministry of Finance should consult with the British and American foreign exchange management authorities and instruct the Central Bank to coordinate and entrust overseas remittance agencies to handle them. Regarding the management and use of frozen funds, it falls under the scope of foreign exchange management. Our government has decided to expand the original Foreign Exchange Examination Committee of the Ministry of Finance, strengthen its personnel, and increase its powers to be the administrative processing agency for the examination of all import and export foreign exchange and the unfreezing of frozen funds. As for the execution of business, it will be handled by the Central Bank and maintain extremely close contact with the British and American foreign exchange management authorities at any time, so that foreign exchange management can reach a strict state, and there will be no leakage of frozen funds. Regarding the question of how to keep the foreign exchange rate of legal tender stable, it has been handed over to the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to use the funds and handle it properly in accordance with the principle of practical management and strict prevention of Japanese speculation. The Chinese members of the committee, Chen Guangfu, Bei Songsun, Xi Demao, the British member, Hobbs, and the American member, Fox, have all arrived in Chongqing, and all the funds to be allocated have been allocated, and they can actively start work. In the future, our country's monetary system should maintain a harmonious and stable relationship with the currencies of Britain and the United States. Finally, Minister Wang Zheng announced to foreign reporters that the organizational regulations for the Chinese county councils have been promulgated. This is an extremely important new policy in China's internal affairs. In the past year and a half, the Central Executive Committee has specially studied this issue in detail, hoping to realize it as soon as possible. At each regular meeting of the National Political Council, there has been discussion on this issue, requesting the government to implement it as soon as possible. Now that the regulations have been promulgated, it is believed that its contribution to China's future internal affairs will be important. In short, there are two points. First, the county representatives are selected from professional groups, and are not appointed by the government. Second, in the future, the local budget must be passed by the council. From the above two points of view, it fully demonstrates China's increasingly democratic politics. The central government will also urge the provincial governments to quickly organize county councils. (11th dispatch)

### The Yellow River Front Line: Chinese Defenses Consolidated; Constant Clashes Increasing Along the Entire Line; Japanese Troops' Attempt to Cross the River Is Absolutely Impossible

Xi'an, Lingbao area, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): A Central News Agency reporter, having spent several days inspecting the Yellow River front line, reports that the positions there are winding and circuitous, with Chinese soldiers scattered throughout. From observation mirrors, Japanese strongholds on the opposite bank are clearly visible. Shells constantly fly overhead, while Chinese soldiers in the trenches are seen reading books or sitting around tables, creating an atmosphere akin to paradise. From Tongguan to Shaanzhou, the hills and city walls are pockmarked with bullet holes, remnants of the battles fought on both sides of the river in May. Along the front line, there are "battlefield taverns" providing affordable services for Chinese soldiers. On the opposite bank, Japanese troops are actively building roads. Heavily loaded Japanese vehicles frequently travel between Yongji and Fenglingdu. Most Japanese soldiers remain holed up in villages and towns,不敢外出。 The important Japanese stronghold of Zhao Village in southeastern Shanxi has now been moved to Xiyao Village, likely to avoid the power of Chinese artillery fire. After finishing his inspection, the reporter visited the commander guarding the river defenses, who said in an extremely humble tone, "The Chinese river defense line is as solid as a rock. With the combination of fortifications and natural terrain, it is absolutely impossible for the Japanese army to recklessly attempt to cross the river. Over the past three years, the Japanese army has spent over 100,000 shells on the river defenses, but not only have they failed to destroy the positions, they have instead strengthened the Chinese river defense forces. The Chinese army's fortifications along the entire line are constantly improving. However, we must not rely solely on natural defenses and passively await victory. On the contrary, we must use strong fortifications to annihilate the Japanese troops on the opposite bank and defend the entire northwest." (10th dispatch)

### US President Returns to Capital, Government to Be Reorganized; British and American Leaders Hold Extensive Yacht Talks

International News Service, Washington, 12th: Sources within the New Deal faction here predicted yesterday that upon President Roosevelt's return to the capital, he will reorganize the cabinet and the defense command, placing the government on a wartime footing. The aim is to prepare for any eventuality, rather than to join the war in Europe or the Far East. The President is reportedly displeased with the slow progress of rearmament and has decided to immediately increase production to meet the new needs of supporting the Soviet Union and Britain. Several cabinet members and officials of the Production Management Bureau will likely be removed. It is widely believed that the President will appoint one person to head the Production Management Bureau, replacing the current dual leadership of Knudsen and Hillman. Some sources have also hinted at the creation of a Department of Aviation, with Colonel Donovan as Secretary of the Army and Hillman as Secretary of Labor. It is widely believed that a cabinet reshuffle is inevitable.

International News Service, Paris, 12th: A German-controlled radio station here stated yesterday that American defense leaders, along with President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill, held a meeting on the yacht "Potomac." A decision "regarding Japan" was likely made yesterday. However, this news could not be confirmed in Washington.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 12th: The London correspondent for the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reports that the Atlantic war was one of the topics discussed at the Potomac meeting. Other topics included methods of sanctioning Japan, the attitude of Britain and America towards Vichy, and Anglo-American cooperation in aiding the Soviet Union. Even postwar reconstruction issues may have been included in the agenda. Discussions have now entered the final stage. British aid to the Soviet Union is not limited to air raids; British troops may land to attack western Germany. Joint British-Soviet action in Iran is also becoming increasingly clear.

Haitong News Agency, Washington, 12th: It is rumored within the US Navy Department that the yacht "Potomac" carrying President Roosevelt has not been reported for two days. This has attracted the attention of some people, as it is customary for the presidential yacht to issue a daily statement disclosing the president's whereabouts.

US Munitions to the Soviet Union, Japan Expresses Concern

Reuters, Tokyo, 12th: Intelligence Bureau spokesman Ishii told foreign journalists today that the Japanese government has not yet expressed its attitude regarding rumors that the United States is supplying the Soviet Union with munitions via Vladivostok. Ishii said that he did not believe reports that Japan had warned the United States not to transport munitions to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok. He also said, "I do not know if the United States has already shipped supplies to the Soviet Union." Ishii reiterated that if the United States uses Vladivostok to supply the Soviet Union with war materials, it will place Japan in a difficult position. As for whether the war materials are shipped on American or Soviet ships, he said there was no difference.

Reuters, Tokyo, 12th: Deputy Intelligence Secretary Ishii told reporters that the inconvenience of the suspension of US-Japan shipping services was insignificant, and there was no need to adjust the situation. Ishii also said that no Japanese ships have been detained in American Pacific ports or Panama. The "Asama Maru" of the Japan Mail Steamship Company has departed from Honolulu and is returning to Japan without going to San Francisco. A reporter asked if the US government had guaranteed not to detain Japanese ships and their cargo. Ishii replied that they had not yet. Ishii declined to disclose the name of the ship on which the Japanese Ambassador to Washington, Wakasugi, was returning home.

### Japanese Spread Rumors: China and the Soviet Union Negotiating an Alliance; Rumors of New Soviet-Japanese Negotiations Unconfirmed; Japan and Manchukuo Take Special Precautions Against the Soviet Union

United Press, Tokyo, 12th: Domei News Agency reported from Nanjing yesterday that, under the instigation of Britain and the United States, Chongqing proposed to Moscow in June to establish a Sino-Soviet military alliance. Domei News Agency claimed that the Sino-Soviet alliance was based on the following conditions: (1) Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union would provide military advisors to assist the Chinese army; (2) the establishment of intermediaries between Chongqing and the Soviet Far East Army to exchange military intelligence; (3) the Soviet Union would provide full assistance to Chongqing and establish military bases in western China in cooperation with Britain and the United States; (4) Chongqing would recognize the Soviet Union's position in Xinjiang Province. Domei News Agency also claimed that the Soviet Union was very cautious about this and demanded that Britain and the United States first actively assist Chongqing. The Soviet Union also reportedly put forward a counter-proposal, consisting of the following four points: (1) The United States and the Soviet Union would take joint air force actions in the Primorsky Krai; (2) The British and American air forces would participate in the Sino-Japanese war; (3) Australian and New Zealand troops would participate in the defense of southwestern China; (4) Britain and the United States would participate in Chinese military and strategic operations in northwestern China.

Reuters, Changchun, 12th: The tension caused by Matsuoka's departure from the Japanese cabinet a few weeks ago has now eased. Rumors have spread from Shanghai that the Soviet Union and Japan are conducting new negotiations. A diplomatic spokesman here has firmly denied this to Reuters, saying that the Soviet-Japanese boundary demarcation conference is still working well. Officials also said that the defensive works being carried out by Manchuria are entirely for self-defense. The Soviet-German conflict has attracted great attention here. Newspapers are printing news from that front in large characters. British and American expatriates in Manchuria are paying particular attention to events. Their situation here is not enviable. Excluding the Kwantung Leased Territory, there are a total of 300 British expatriates in Manchuria, 222 in the 　Yang district, and 70 in the Harbin district, mostly missionaries. There are only 70 American expatriates. The various precautions taken in Manchuria cannot be disclosed, but it can be said that travel is restricted and there are occasional air defense exercises in various cities. Manchuria is following Japan's lead in freezing foreign funds, but has recently relaxed its controls somewhat. Some commercial firms with British and American capital are still allowed to continue operating.

Xinjiang's Attitude Towards British Expatriates Improves

Reuters, Beijing, 12th: According to news from Tashkent received here, the Xinjiang government's attitude towards British expatriates has greatly improved since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. Therefore, the British and Afghans who were preparing to leave Xinjiang have now decided to stay.

### Japan Puts National Economy on a Full Wartime Footing; Securities, Prices, and Shipping Under Strict Control; Tokyo Newspaper Advises the United States Not to Oppress Japan

Reuters, Tokyo, 12th: The National Mobilization Investigation Committee held a meeting at the Prime Minister's residence yesterday afternoon and passed four Imperial decrees to put Japan on a complete wartime economic footing. These four decrees will be implemented within days and include: (1) revising the Price Control Law; (2) revising the wartime shipping control measures; (3) restricting securities prices; (4) temporarily fixing the prices of company stocks and securities. It is widely believed that the revision of the Price Control Law will allow the government to continue to implement this law whenever it deems necessary. The shipping control law will give the state greater control to manage facilities such as shipyards and docks. The details of the securities decree are not yet known, but it is expected that the government will restrict the value of securities and futures trading.

Reuters, Tokyo, 12th: The Kokumin Shimbun recently published an editorial advising the United States not to take any steps to oppress Japan, saying that the United States' stubborn refusal to heed warnings will result in a complete rupture of existing tensions. The paper insisted that British and American efforts to obstruct Japan's established policies were futile, and said that Tokyo would move forward with the utmost determination to establish a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere based on peace.

### Western Hemisphere Organizes "International Granary" Plan – Stockpiling Grain for Post-War Relief

Reuters, Washington, 12th: A Washington correspondent for the New York Journal of Commerce claims that the US government has begun to stockpile large quantities of food in preparation for sending them to Europe, China, and other disaster areas after the war. A plan has also been drafted to organize an "international granary" in the Western Hemisphere. In addition to the United States, Argentina, Canada, and Australia have also begun stockpiling surplus grains.

Philippine Economic Situation Serious

United Press, Washington, 12th: According to information received today from senior officials, the economic situation in the Philippines is more serious than is generally known here. If the shortage of ships is not alleviated, the economic situation will reach a crisis stage. Some officials expect that Washington or Manila may have to take drastic steps to deal with the situation. Philippine Commissioner to the United States, Elizalde, has been consulting with officials in Manila to solicit their views on the situation. It is understood that he is currently considering how to submit the true situation to federal officials.

### Darlan's Powers Expanded; Military Power Concentrated in One Person; Foreign Policy to Remain Consistent; General Weygand Quietly Returns to North Africa

Havas News Agency, Vichy, 12th: The results of the talks that government authorities have been conducting since last March will be revealed this afternoon. The official announcement is scheduled for 6:00 PM. According to well-informed sources, the cabinet drafted several internal policy orders yesterday, the most important of which is to strengthen the powers of Deputy Premier Darlan. It is likely that all military power will be concentrated in Mr. Darlan's hands. It is also learned that Chief of State Pétain is scheduled to deliver a radio address at 9:00 PM tonight, explaining the government's decisions.

Havas News Agency, Vichy, 12th: Regarding the important decisions that the government will announce this afternoon, the public's greatest concern is the future position of Deputy Premier Darlan. Mr. Darlan is likely to be appointed Minister of National Defense or "Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force" in order to concentrate military power in one person and change the existing three ministries into departments. This decision was likely made before yesterday's cabinet meeting. Therefore, General Weygand quietly returned to his North African defense area without attending the cabinet meeting. Chief of State Pétain's radio address tonight will emphasize the call for "unity," because a lack of unity will be used as propaganda by the collaborationists. The talks between the authorities have touched upon diplomatic issues, which have been confirmed. Well-informed sources say that French foreign policy will remain consistent and based on the declarations repeatedly issued by government authorities since the Montoire meeting.

Reuters, Berlin, 12th: German radio reported from Vichy that in the French cabinet reshuffle, Deputy Premier Darlan will concurrently serve as Minister of National Defense, the position of Minister of the Army has been abolished, and Huntziger has been reassigned as Military Secretary of State. Former Minister of the Interior Pucheu has been promoted to Minister of the Interior. It is claimed that the above-mentioned reshuffle has not been officially confirmed. Huntziger met with Weygand before Saturday's cabinet meeting, after which Weygand returned to North Africa without attending the cabinet meeting.

US-French Relations Hanging by a Thread; French Troops in Vietnam Mass on the Yunnan-Guangxi Border; This Action is Detrimental to Chinese Forces

Reuters, Washington, 12th: According to well-informed sources here, the relationship between the United States and Vichy is approaching an extremely tense stage. A break in diplomatic relations within days is also within expectations. The relationship between the two countries has been hanging by a thread for some time. The reason the United States is maintaining this relationship is simply to maintain an important mechanism in Europe to observe and listen to everything, and to hope that American power can somewhat offset German pressure on Vichy. However, information has been received that Vichy is obeying Berlin's orders more diligently than ever. According to recent reports, the French have agreed to send Vietnamese troops stationed on the Yunnan-Guangxi border to protect the flanks of the Japanese army in northern Vietnam, which is detrimental to Chinese forces. It is said that this was done by Vichy at Germany's urging. Key figures here hold a deep feeling that whoever does not support me is against me. This is the only realistic attitude in a world threatened by the Nazis. Vichy's actions cannot be considered as tending towards democratic countries, which is a sign that US-French relations are about to break down. France claimed that it could not maintain its honor in Syria without fighting the British, but gave Vietnam to Japan as a gift without considering its honor. This is especially abhorrent to Americans.

Japanese Commemorate the Battle of Zhanggufeng

Havas News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: Today is the third anniversary of the armistice of the Soviet-Japanese Battle of Zhanggufeng. Many soldiers who participated in the battle and the families of the fallen soldiers went to the Yasukuni Shrine to pay tribute to the souls of the fallen soldiers.

Canada Prepares to Build Ships

Reuters, London, 12th: Canada is currently preparing a shipbuilding program that includes building several destroyers next year and launching one million tons of merchant ships. This new effort is one of the matters discussed by Canadian Naval Minister Macdonald, Canadian Naval Chief of Staff Nelles, British Naval Secretary Alexander, and other officials in London this week. According to Macdonald, Canada needs technical assistance, which he hopes to get from Britain. The merchant ship construction program will begin this summer. The first ship can be completed this year, and 100 new merchant ships are expected to be launched next year. The entire plan will be completed next year, at which time it is hoped that one million tons of merchant ships will be launched. However, this number will undoubtedly increase in the following year. He can only say that Canada will place its fleet in the most advantageous position. A major naval base has now been established in Esquimalt Harbour. The most important task of the Canadian Navy is to defend Canada in all locations. Since the outbreak of the war, the number of Canadian naval vessels has increased from 13 to 250, and its personnel have increased from 1,800 to 22,000.

British Expatriates in Borneo Evacuate to Singapore

Reuters, Singapore, 12th: The British in Sarawak and Borneo are now evacuating. Several of them, including women and children, have arrived here. More are expected to arrive. Hotels are overcrowded. Some evacuees from Saigon are also about to arrive here.

### A Glimpse of Wartime Zhengzhou: The Longhai Railway is Completely Destroyed, Highways are Flooded, the Scenery is Desolate but the Fighting Spirit is Strong

Chongqing – Today, I truly understood the real meaning of the scorched earth policy for the first time. Starting from Luoyang, I traveled for three days by bicycle and sand boat in the Zhengzhou area. I learned that the scorched earth policy is not just about destruction, but also about special construction. The Longhai Railway has been completely destroyed, and the roadbed has become a pasture for sheep. Only the concrete bridge pillars remain of the former bridge markers. Many sections of the main highways have been flooded, but I discovered many secret routes. These secret routes, and the trenches dug in the muddy fields, allow Chinese carts and donkey carts to pass unhindered, but they can never be used by the Japanese mechanized forces. I arrived in Zhengzhou, which used to be a thriving commercial town, a junction for railways, but is now half empty, only the skeleton remains. Zhengzhou is almost completely isolated from other free Chinese areas, with only soldiers, guerrillas, spies, smugglers, priests, a few merchants, and many poor farmers. This decisive battle has set Zhengzhou back at least thirty years. All factories, though closed, have allowed impoverished families to restore their handicrafts. In this desolate scene, as many as 1,060 students from the countryside gathered under the shade of the trees in the park to participate in the middle school entrance examination organized by General Sun Tongxuan, the commander of this area. Even though these students know that Zhengzhou is often bombed and has no air raid shelters, they are still willing to come here to study, which further shows that China is still striving for progress despite extreme difficulties.

Chairman Chiang's Condolence Message: A Secret History of the Tagore Family

Chongqing – Chairman Chiang recently sent a condolence message to Tagore's family, saying: "Comrade Tan Yunshan, please forward my condolences to the family of Mr. Tagore. The elder and wise man is no more, and his teachings are unheard. Eastern civilization has lost its bellwether. Looking forward to our southern neighbor, I am filled with mourning. I send this telegram with condolences, Chiang Kai-shek." (11th telegram)

### A Week of War News: August 1st to 7th

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Therefore, it is impossible to clearly understand its movements. The two routes of the Japanese, invading south from Shashi Cenhekou, have invaded Pengjiachang north of Hao Xue, and were fiercely attacked by the powerful Chinese forces, and were eventually defeated by the Chinese. The Japanese were defeated in the north, and the Chinese are giving chase. One route of the Japanese, invading south from Shayang Nanyaohaozikou to Yangjiaqiao, has also been repelled by the Chinese. The Chinese took advantage of the victory to recapture Haozi, and surrounded the Japanese in Lujiadian, Zhoujiadian, and other places. Another route of the Japanese invading south from Qianjiang was blocked by the Chinese in the area east of Xiongkou City. After days of fierce fighting, many Japanese were killed and wounded.

Northern Hubei – A unit of Suixian invaded near Liangshui Jing on the morning of the 31st of last month, attempting to plunder food. They were surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army, and more than half of the Japanese were killed or wounded. The Japanese broke through and retreated towards Poshan. On the evening of the 3rd, they were again attacked by a certain unit of the Chinese army. The battle lasted until dawn on the 4th, and the Chinese captured a lot of military supplies.

Northern Jiangxi – The Japanese in Ruoxi Wangjiapu and other places counterattacked the Chinese on the 30th. Until the 31st, the Chinese and Japanese were still repeatedly attacking each other in the Xiajiaqiao and Xinxi Yuan areas. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. On the morning of the 1st, the Japanese reinforced in large numbers again and invaded Pankeng and Lengjia. The Chinese gave them another fierce attack, and they were finally repelled by the Chinese. The Japanese left behind more than 500 corpses and retreated.

Southern Anhui – The Japanese army near Dongliu launched three attacks on the 3rd. One unit invaded Hunan south of the city, and was blocked by the Chinese army in the mountains south of Dongshuting. One unit attacked Tuanfengling via Dafengshan Qingshan and Dongshuling, and many were killed by the Chinese army. One unit attacked east from Shikou and was blocked by the Chinese army. The Japanese made no progress.

Southern Guangdong – A Japanese warship carrying more than a thousand Japanese soldiers sailed to Niudao Xiyan Sea, Leizhou, on the 28th of last month and forcibly landed, invading towards Chikan Huaixi. They were met by the Chinese army, and the battle lasted until the morning of the 29th. Many Japanese were killed and wounded, and they retreated on the original warship. (12th telegram)

### Soviet Aircraft Attack Berlin Again, German Capital Hit by Bombs, Fires and Explosions, Fierce Air Battle Over Murmansk

Reuters, Moscow, 12th – A Soviet communiqué stated that on August 11th, Soviet troops continued to engage the enemy in the areas of Soltsy, Smolensk, Belaya Tserkov, Uman, and in the Estonian sector of the front. The Soviet air force continued to strike at enemy mechanized units and infantry, as well as their aircraft and airfields. It also bombed and damaged the railway bridge over the Danube River in Chanovitz, and enemy ships in Constanta. On August 10th, 39 enemy aircraft were destroyed, and the Soviets lost 25 aircraft. According to accurate information obtained, six German aircraft were shot down in a night raid on Moscow on the 10th. From August 10th to 11th, Soviet aircraft again attacked military targets in Berlin, dropping high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. Fires and explosions were seen outside the city of Berlin. All but one of the Soviet aircraft returned safely to their bases. A few days ago, 60 to 70 German and Finnish aircraft attempted to attack the Murmansk area. Soviet fighters intercepted them, and a fierce air battle ensued. The Soviet aircraft launched a fierce attack, breaking through the enemy's combat formation in one fell swoop. The German and Finnish aircraft lost their focus and scattered into small groups. The Soviet aircraft continued to strike fiercely at the disorganized Fascist bombers. Six of them, under the intense pressure of the Soviet aircraft, quickly evaded and fled to the southwest. Two Fascist aircraft were hit by bombs, caught fire, and crashed to the ground. Two other enemy aircraft were also severely damaged. The German and Finnish aircraft's attempt to launch their largest attack on the Murmansk area since the start of the war ended in a disastrous defeat. In that decisive air battle, Soviet fighters shot down a total of 13 German and Finnish bombers, and anti-aircraft fire shot down three enemy aircraft. The Soviet air force lost only one aircraft. Two Soviet fighters were also hit by shrapnel, but after repairs, they have returned to battle.

Reuters, Stockholm, 12th – In order to show that Smolensk has indeed been occupied, the Germans are now leading neutral observers to visit the city. The city has been thoroughly destroyed. According to German officers, the first troops to enter were forced to withdraw due to the intense fire.

United Press, Moscow, 12th – Officials announced today that Soviet aircraft bombed Berlin for the third night last night, and German aircraft also launched their seventeenth attack on Moscow last night. Several German aircraft broke through the Soviet defenses and dropped various bombs of different sizes on Moscow, destroying several houses and killing and wounding residents, but no fires were started. The alarm was raised at midnight and lifted at 2:05 AM today. The Soviet official news agency TASS claimed that the German aircraft were scattered before they reached Moscow. (Berlin officials claimed that only Soviet aircraft flew to Berlin.)

Reuters, Stockholm, 12th – German officials reported that the Soviet bombers that attacked Berlin on Sunday night were driven back by anti-aircraft fire. In fact, the Soviet aircraft apparently flew to the outskirts of Berlin. A dispatch from Berlin in the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet stated that the whirring of attacking aircraft was not heard in the central area of the German capital, but residents in the suburbs said that the sound made by the Soviet aircraft was clearly different from that of the British aircraft.

Reuters, London, 12th – According to recent Soviet communiqués, German troops are still pressing hard along the entire Soviet front, and the Soviet line has shifted slightly backward in Soltsy, southwest of Leningrad, and in southern Ukraine. German troops in Krivoy Rog and Belaya Tserkov, who have met with extremely fierce resistance, are now advancing south in an attempt to find weaknesses and threaten Odessa. However, the mercenary troops on the extreme right wing of the German army, which are closer to Odessa, do not seem to be providing much assistance to the German army. The slight shift in the Soviet line in the two locations has created a concave shape, which may be part of General Budyonny's elastic defense. The Germans do not claim to have captured any location, but continue to speak vaguely, saying that they are pursuing the defeated army everywhere and are making rapid progress. Hitler has never concealed the secrets of his strategy, which is to attack continuously, regardless of losses, and not allow the enemy to catch their breath, until the attack succeeds. This strategy has been consistently implemented in Poland, France, Southern Countries, Greece, and Crete, but the German air force's attack on Britain a year ago failed. At that time, the German air force attacked Britain continuously for over a week, trying its best to break the British resistance, but it failed and abandoned it. Now, the German army is encountering the same indomitable spirit in its operations against the Soviet Union. The German army has been exerting pressure continuously for seven weeks, trying to force the Soviet army to retreat along the 2,000-mile front, but the German army has never won a major victory, and the resistance of the Soviet army everywhere has never shown any weakness. The question that has now arisen is how long the German army can continue to press forward without revealing signs of failure. Human endurance is limited, and both sides must be approaching this limit. However, the situation is favorable to the Soviet Union, because the Soviet army is fighting to defend its freedom and homes. Even if it retreats slowly, its lines of communication are gradually shortening, and its manpower and material resources are becoming more abundant. As the German army advances, its strength is gradually weakening. Judging from the current situation, there will be a definite result on the vast Soviet-German front in the next few days.

### British and Soviet Air Forces Closely Cooperate to Bomb Berlin and Major Cities

United Press, London, 12th

Observers here said yesterday that Britain and the Soviet Union may launch joint air raids on Berlin and other important German centers in the near future. Well-informed circles believe that continuous air raids on Berlin by the Royal Air Force or the Soviet Air Force are possible. Some sources say that British and American bombers may take turns attacking on the same night. Observers pointed out that the long nights ahead could cause greater air damage to Berlin. Observers said that Britain has gradually recognized that the morale of the Berlin population is an important military target.

### German Propaganda: German Army's Pursuit in Ukrainian Campaign is Very Successful

United Press, Berlin, 12th

The official German news agency said yesterday that the pursuit campaign in southern Ukraine was very successful. German and allied forces are not far from the Black Sea coast. The news agency said that the German air force is also participating effectively, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The news agency also reported that Germany's naval battles against the Soviet Union are going smoothly. German destroyers operating in the northern Baltic Sea sank a Soviet patrol boat with artillery in the past few days. Also, a German submarine sank a Soviet destroyer in the area. In the air battles on the eastern front on Sunday, 54 Soviet aircraft were shot down, and the Germans lost only four aircraft.

### Germany Concentrates Ships in the Black Sea to Prepare to Attack the City of Odessa

United Press, Istanbul, 12th

Well-informed military sources recently revealed that for several months, about 200 German ships, each capable of carrying 400 people, docked at Constanta, as well as more than a dozen submarines, are poised to act once the German army is able to reach the Black Sea coast and occupy Odessa and Nikolaev. Foreign military experts are aware that the German army is withdrawing its troops near Odessa to avoid encirclement. If this plan succeeds, the Nazis will use these ships to transport troops directly to Odessa and land there.

### Guerrilla Forces in Occupied Western Belorussia Intercept German Convoys

TASS, Moscow, 12th

In the territory of Western Belorussia occupied by the German fascist forces, the area of guerrilla warfare is expanding daily. In the vicinity of the city of Morodych, Vi Xiangyin district, a large number of enemy motorcycles were derailed. Guerrillas killed ten enemy generals and twelve guards, and captured two light machine guns and a large number of bullets. A train carrying enemy cargo, hiding in a forest near a certain city to avoid Soviet aircraft, was discovered by guerrillas. When the Fascist train stopped, the guerrillas set fire to the forest and fired machine guns at the enemy. The Germans were panic-stricken and ten soldiers were trampled under horses' hooves. The Fascist soldiers fled in confusion, leaving behind 42 freight cars, 32 ammunition cars, and 37 corpses in the forest. Near the city of Grodno, in the Neman River, guerrillas sank an enemy motorboat, and ten German soldiers drowned. Near a village, guerrillas saw thirty Fascists transporting six light artillery pieces on rafts. When they approached the river bank, they opened fire, killing eight Fascists. The rest jumped into the river and fled to the other side.

### All-Slavic Congress Issues Declaration in Soviet Capital, Opposing Narcotic Pan-Slavism, Demanding Slavs Unite to Destroy Nazis

TASS, Moscow, 12th

The All-Slavic Congress was held in Moscow on the 10th and 11th, and today issued a declaration to all Slavic countries. In addition to detailing the atrocities of the German and Italian Fascists in France, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Austria, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Greece, and other countries, it firmly opposes Pan-Slavism and calls on all Slavs to unite to destroy Fascist Germany and its vassals. The declaration states in part: "To our oppressed Slavic compatriots: France, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Austria, Holland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Greece, and other countries are now under the yoke of German Fascism and its vassals Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Finland. Hitler is most hostile to the Slavs. The vicious plan of the German Fascists is to permanently occupy Slavic lands and turn the Slavic people into German slaves. To implement their vicious plan, the German Fascists have adopted extremely vicious measures: (1) 100,000 people in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Carpatho-Ukraine have been imprisoned in concentration camps; (2) In a year and a half, Germany has destroyed the Polish nation and killed three million Polish people; (3) In Austrian cities, the German Fascists have been auctioning off Austrian people, treating them as slaves; (4) The capital of Yugoslavia has been destroyed. In the first few days of the occupation, German troops killed 32,000 civilians. Yugoslavia has been divided by Germany, Italy, and Hungary. In three months, 80,000 Serbs have been killed; (5) After Lviv in Ukraine was occupied by the German Fascists, 60,000 residents were also killed. Oppressed Slavic nations, we are facing a serious crisis. It is time for Slavs all over the world to unite and destroy German Fascism. We firmly oppose Pan-Slavism, which was created by Imperial Russia and used to achieve its imperialist goals. It is absolutely contrary to the equality and independence of our Slavic nations. Oppressed Slavic nations, the enemy is extremely stubborn, but if we unite, our strength will exceed the enemy's. Moreover, we still have the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and all democratic countries as our backing. We should rise up quickly and wage a war of liberation against Hitlerism, and sentence the bandits Hitler and Mussolini to death."

Havas, Moscow, 11th

Today, the Second Pan-Slavic Movement Conference was held here, expressing opposition to Hitler. The chairman was Ukrainian screenwriter Garin-Trochok. Speakers included Polish writer Mrs. Wasilewska, Ukrainian poet Kubala, former Czech parliamentarians Maleska, Schliega, Logothetti, and famous Soviet writer Fadeyev.

German Aircraft Runs Out of Fuel, Lands in Turkish Territory

Reuters, Ankara, 12th

Last night, a German Junkers Ju 88 bomber was forced to land on the Turkish coast near Fethiye due to running out of fuel. The three crew members threw documents, gunsights, and other equipment into the sea. All three were unharmed and have been detained. The aircraft is half-submerged in the water.

Turkey Fears German Attack

United Press, Istanbul, 12th

Turkey's anxiety over reported German troop movements has increased, as various sources have stated that large contingents of German troops from Libya have appeared in Bulgaria. According to Axis sources arriving here from the Balkans, the newly arrived German troops number at least two divisions. It is also reported that the Germans are stepping up the construction of the main bridge connecting the Bulgarian and Istanbul railways, which was destroyed by Greece.

### War Approaches Turkish Border, Country Finds Neutrality Difficult, If Germany Preemptively Attacks Turkey, Britain Will Help the Soviet Union Defend Baku Oil Fields

Havas, Switzerland, 11th

According to observers here, the German advance in southeastern Ukraine, talk of British aid to the Red Army to defend the Caucasus oilfields, and various rumors about the Near East all prove that the war is approaching the borders of Turkey. The country's neutral position is becoming increasingly delicate. Although the country's newspapers have commented extensively on the future situation in southeastern Europe, the government remains very calm, hoping to maintain a balance between Britain and Germany under the Anglo-Turkish Mutual Assistance Treaty and the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty. To take precautions, it has been taking various steps for more than a year. The London newspapers have taken a reserved attitude toward Turkey, while officials acknowledge that they are now focusing their attention on Turkey, as the German ambassador to Turkey, Von Papen, has returned to Ankara from his summer vacation, and is inevitably active. However, Berlin believes that Britain and Russia secretly signed an agreement in 1916 to partition Turkey, which is also remembered in Turkey, and it must be vigilant and draw closer to Germany. At present, there are widespread rumors in London and the United States that a front line will be established in the Near East. Rome is paying particular attention to the situation in the Caucasus, believing that Britain has concentrated 500,000 troops in Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, equipped with the latest weapons, and will launch a large-scale offensive in the Near East to assist the Soviet Union in defending the Baku oil region. If so, the British army will have to pass through Iraq, Iran, and Turkey. Another theory is that Germany will launch a preemptive strike in the Near East. The United States and Britain attach great importance to this theory. In summary, Turkey may be forced to make a major decision.

Reuters, Vichy, 12th

The French official news agency in Ankara reported that the Turkish government has approved a new bill stipulating that 19-year-old men are eligible to be called up for military service in extraordinary circumstances, but the normal military service age remains 20.

### Further Talks on the European War (7) (5)  A Scene of the British-German Naval Battle in the North Atlantic

In late May 1941, a naval battle occurred in the North Atlantic between the British and German navies. In this battle, the German's newest 17,500-ton battleship "Bismarck" and the British 41,100-ton battlecruiser "Hood" were sunk one after the other, making it a magnificent page in naval battle history. The actual situation is recounted as follows:

On May 21, 1941, two giant warships departed westward from Bergen Harbor in Norway. One was smaller, named "Prinz Eugen," and the other was large and of a very strange design. This was the "Bismarck," Germany's first venture. These two powerful "German pirates" quietly sailed out of the Baltic Sea, aiming to attack British convoy merchant fleets. However, the British Navy was on extremely high alert during these days, so how could the German warships' movements escape the reconnaissance of British naval aircraft? After receiving the report, the British Naval Headquarters hurriedly arranged everything. On that day, the British fast cruisers "Norfolk" and "Suffolk" were ordered to sail to the Denmark Strait to observe the situation. That evening, enemy warships were discovered advancing through the snowstorm in the North Atlantic, appearing to be entering the Denmark Strait. The British fleet then stood ready for battle.

On the morning of the 24th, the "Bismarck" and "Prinz Eugen," one in front and one behind, sailed into the Denmark Strait, waiting for an opportunity to hunt their targets. As they approached the boundary between Iceland and Greenland, two large monsters suddenly appeared, blocking their path. It turned out that two British capital ships had been waiting for a long time. One was the battlecruiser "Hood," known as the world's largest, and the other was the powerful new battleship "Prince of Wales." However, the German warships, relying on their thick armor and powerful firepower, did not flinch. Both sides immediately began to exchange broadsides. The rumbling sound shook the sky. In less than five minutes, a sudden explosion occurred on the "Hood," with flames erupting as if the ammunition depot had been hit and exploded. In an instant, it disappeared into the sea, and the sound of the cannons also ceased with sorrow. At that time, the "Prince of Wales" had also been damaged. Although the "Bismarck" had won the initial victory, it could not avoid being hit by several shells, and then it and the "Prinz Eugen" sped off in different directions to the southwest. The British fleet was unwilling to give up. The "Norfolk" and "Suffolk" chased closely behind. After receiving the report, the British aircraft carrier also dispatched torpedo planes to assist in the pursuit. However, after the German warships sailed out of the Denmark Strait, their whereabouts became unknown. The British fleet then conducted a thorough search throughout the North Atlantic.

At 10:30 a.m. on the 26th, a British light reconnaissance aircraft discovered the "Bismarck" sailing east, appearing to be escaping to the port of Brest in occupied France. The "Prinz Eugen" had disappeared. The British Navy, eager for revenge, immediately dispatched the entire Mediterranean and Home Fleets, a total of hundreds of warships of all sizes, to encircle and attack the German warship. This kind of resolute and adventurous British action was unprecedented. Even when Admiral Nelson led his fleet to fight Napoleon, the Home Fleet never left the country's defenses by half a step.

Before long, the aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" also dispatched torpedo planes, and with lightning-like speed, the newest battleship "King George V" and "Rodney" followed with fierce artillery fire, attacking it from both sides. The "Bismarck" began to lose its ability to resist. Captain Lütjens, knowing that he was hopeless, sent a desperate wireless message to the mainland, stating that the ship had lost control. "We will fight to the last. Long live the Führer!" The distance to the port of Brest was only 400 miles, less than a day's voyage.

Seventy-eight hours after the sinking of the "Hood," two aerial torpedoes struck the sides of the "Bismarck's" hull. The ship was severely damaged, and its speed was greatly reduced. The British destroyers then took the opportunity to attack, hitting it with two more underwater torpedoes. As a result, the "Bismarck's" rudder lost control, and it moved erratically, but it still fought like a cornered beast, attempting to break through the encirclement.

By the morning of the 27th, the "Bismarck's" speed had been reduced to 11-12 knots (originally 32 knots), but its firepower was still fierce, preventing the British warships from approaching.

At 11:01 a.m. on the same day, the British destroyer "Dorsetshire" boldly approached and fired the last torpedo, piercing the bottom of the ship. The "Bismarck" then sank to the bottom of the sea. With the sinking of the "Bismarck," the British Navy finally vented its anger. Strategically speaking, the victory belonged to the British. Britain lost an old battlecruiser that was 22 years old, while Germany lost a brand new, invincible battleship. Britain lost one vice admiral and 1,300 officers and soldiers. Germany lost one fleet commander and 2,400 officers and soldiers. The sinking of the "Hood" only cost Britain one-sixteenth of its capital ship strength. The existing "Repulse," "Renown," and the newly built "King George V" and "Prince of Wales" all have firepower comparable to the "Hood." The loss of the "Bismarck" accounted for one-fourth of Germany's capital ship strength. At present, only the "Bismarck's" sister ship "Tirpitz" and the 16,000-ton "Gneisenau" and "Scharnhorst" remain.

However, Britain has no great glory. The majestic "Hood" was sunk by the German warship in five minutes. On the contrary, the "Bismarck" fought against a hundred, fighting a bloody battle of 1,755 miles in the Atlantic. It was only because it suffered a fatal blow from an aerial torpedo that it lost its ability to move. Moreover, after the "Hood" was lost, the British warships were afraid of repeating the disaster and did not dare to get too close. The power of the German warship can be imagined.

The fundamental reason for the disparity in strength between the "Hood" and the "Bismarck" lies in the quality of construction technology. The former was built before the last European war and was of an old design. Although it had a large tonnage, high speed, and strong firepower, its armor was not thick and was easily penetrated.

### Today is the Fourth Anniversary of the Shanghai War: All Sectors Strengthen Their Beliefs, Voluntarily Stop Entertainment Banquets to Express Grief, and the Concessions are Heavily Guarded to Ensure Security

Today is the fourth anniversary of the Shanghai War. All sectors of the city have voluntarily stopped entertainment banquets and solemnly commemorate the occasion. The Shanghai Youth Federation has sent a telegram to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek to pay their respects. The authorities in the two concessions have intensified their security measures. Details are as follows:

Stop Entertainment and Observe Silence to Express Grief. Today is the fourth anniversary of the Shanghai War. Due to the special environment of Shanghai, no ceremonies will be held in the city. However, to express the firm belief of the people of Shanghai in resisting aggression and to mourn the fallen soldiers and compatriots, it has been decided that all entertainment banquets in the city will be suspended today, and people will observe a vegetarian diet for one day. At 12:00 noon, everyone will stand in their respective positions to observe a moment of silence to express grief. At the same time, they will actively promote disaster relief efforts to fulfill their national duties and show the enthusiasm of the compatriots in the isolated island.

Youth Federation Sends Telegram to Generalissimo to Pay Respects. The Shanghai Youth Federation, in commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the Shanghai War, yesterday sent a special telegram to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and the former soldiers to pay their respects, vowing to support national policy with utmost sincerity and fight to the end. The Lide Friendship Society also issued a letter to the citizens, the content of which is divided into two points: one is to respond to the V-campaign, and the other is to promote the fundraising movement for scholarships as much as possible. The words are earnest, and the length of the article is not recorded.

Troops and Merchant Corps Heavily Defend. In view of the tense situation on the fourth anniversary of the Shanghai War, the Public Concession authorities have strengthened their security forces. Since yesterday morning, all American and Italian troops stationed in Shanghai have been mobilized and deployed in various districts. They are patrolling in groups of five within the designated defense zones. The Jing'an Temple Road area in the western district is defended by American troops, the areas along the extra-territorial roads in western Shanghai are defended by Italian troops, and the area east of Yuqiaqing Road to the Bund is defended by members of the International Merchant Corps. The front of the Special First District Court is also guarded by the Merchant Corps in conjunction with detectives. As for the French Concession, all French troops stationed in Shanghai and volunteers have also been mobilized to patrol. In addition, the International Merchant Corps has also fully mobilized, with a total force of one regiment and three battalions, totaling about 2,000 men.

Male and Female Inspectors Conduct Separate Searches. In addition to ordering a large number of detectives and dispatching armored vehicles and armored cars to patrol the streets and inspect pedestrians at any time, the police authorities are also conducting strict inspections of pedestrians and vehicles entering and leaving the traffic intersections. Each intersection is guarded by Chinese and Western armed detectives to carry out strict searches. The French Concession has also added female inspectors to search women coming and going, and the preventive measures are particularly thorough.

Amusement Parks Temporarily Closed. All amusement parks in the city, such as the Great World, New World, Tianyunlou, and Xian Shi Amusement Park, as well as theaters such as the Golden Theater, Grand Theater, Gong Stage, and Carlton Theater, as well as all cinemas, bookstores, drama theaters, and dance halls, etc., have decided to voluntarily close today in commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the Shanghai War.

Japanese Authorities Maintain Vigilance in Various Districts of Hongkou. The Japanese authorities have installed barbed wire on all bridges in the Hongkou district, such as the Fourth Zhabei Bridge, Yokohama Bridge, New Bridge, Jiaxing Road Bridge, Ouka Road Bridge, Outer Hongkou Bridge, Middle Hongkou Bridge, Inner Hongkou Bridge, etc., and increased the number of guards. Traffic on the Huangpu River and inland rivers has also been closed in advance. Since yesterday morning, multiple motorboats with machine guns mounted on the bows have been dispatched, driven by the Japanese Navy, patrolling between Wusong and Gaochang Temple and in the Suzhou Creek.

Traffic on the Huangpu River is Completely Blocked. Traffic on the Huangpu River has also been blocked today. Ships traveling to Nanhupu, Tangkou, Wangjiadu, Yexie, Zhagang, Dujiahang, Minhang, and Zhujing are all suspended. Waterway traffic in the upper reaches of the Suzhou Creek, in the Beixinjing and Yujidun areas, has also been blocked. No ships are allowed to enter or leave, so all inland river boats are suspended.

Vegetable Vendors Fearful, Prices Soar. Since the land and water traffic around the concessions has been blocked, the price of vegetables in the city has risen sharply. The daily supply of vegetables for residents within the isolated island mostly comes from the Zhenru, Beixinjing, Sijing, Qibao, and Pudong areas in western Shanghai. Now that the land and water routes are all blocked, poor vendors, fearing danger, are painfully suspending their business, so there are few goods arriving daily, and the prices of vegetables in various vegetable markets are rising.

Trains on Both Lines Suspended Today. In addition to the above-mentioned traffic in the four suburbs being completely blocked, trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing lines will be suspended for one day today to prevent guerrilla attacks and ensure safety. If the situation is good, the trains may resume tomorrow morning. Furthermore, all the iron gates connecting the French Concession and the Nanshi area will also be closed for one day today.

Continued Security Measures to be Lifted on the 15th. The security measures implemented in the two concessions began on the morning of the 9th. The situation is even more tense today and tomorrow. The security measures will continue to be implemented tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, and are scheduled to be lifted after 12:00 p.m. on the 15th. However, if the situation is peaceful and no incidents occur, the measures may be shortened temporarily. The curfew time will still be implemented from 12:30 a.m. today and will not be brought forward.

Japanese Spokesperson Changes Tone

Views the China Incident as a Local Problem, Does Not Urgently Seek to End It, and Listens to Its Natural Development

According to Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama, a Japanese military spokesman, at a press conference yesterday, Japan views the "China Incident" as a local problem in all military efforts, and will continue to do so in the future. He said that the Japanese army is not eager to end the matter and will let it develop naturally, but the resolution of the "China Incident" is closer than it was six months ago. Regarding the Chinese side's reports of the Japanese army withdrawing from central China, Akiyama said that the Japanese army is indeed making adjustments, especially in Shanxi Province, but this adjustment does not mean that the Japanese army is reducing its strength. Akiyama also declared that Japan is paying close attention to the news that Chinese military supplies are being transported to Vladivostok. He pointed out that these military supplies are probably for the distant armies being transported to the Soviet Union, or they may be transported to Chongqing. The transportation of these military supplies is part of the American "encirclement campaign" against Japan. The United States regards Chongqing as the "first line of defense."

Taikoo's Shun Tian Wheel Sails to Hong Kong, Transferred to the Naval Department

Taikoo Company's North China liner Shun Tian has now been requisitioned by the British Naval Department, has ceased operations in Shanghai, and has completed its affairs. As reported in previous newspapers, all matters concerning the ship have now been completed. It is scheduled to set sail south at 3:00 p.m. today, first to Hong Kong, where it will be handed over to the British Naval Department, and then to Singapore, where it will await orders.

### Chinese Merchants Bank Asks for Special Notes for Future Foreign Exchange Transactions, Shanghai Banks First Settle Outstanding Foreign Exchange, and Entrust the Bank of China to Handle the Remainder

After the US government issued general notes to the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China, specially authorizing them to safeguard China's legitimate trade with the US and its allies, the Central Bank has, in accordance with the provisions of General Note No. 60, notified various Chinese merchants banks to handle the outstanding business of the Chinese merchants banks engaged in foreign exchange.

Banks Agree on Settlement Procedures. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from various Chinese merchants banks yesterday that the Shanghai, Continental, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Enterprise, Overseas Chinese, East Asia, Guohuo, Guohua, Zhongfu, Jin City, Zhongnan, Kenye, Zhongxing, Guangdong, and Enterprise banks, which are engaged in foreign exchange, held a discussion meeting and decided that for the foreign exchange bought and sold by the banks before July 26, the banks should first offset each other, and the funds that should be received and paid should be entrusted to the Central Bank to handle the receipt, payment, or transfer of funds in the United States on their behalf, so as to avoid being frozen by the US government. All banks should also submit a detailed list of outstanding foreign exchange transactions, whether bought or sold, to the Banking Association for aggregation and calculation. For future foreign exchange business, the banks should first directly entrust their agents in New York to forward a request to the Chinese Embassy in the United States to the US Treasury Department, in accordance with the provisions of the general note, to issue special business notes to maintain the legitimate foreign exchange business of the Chinese merchants banks.

The Powers and Responsibilities of the Foreign Exchange Committee are Expanded. It is reported that, with regard to the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds by the United Kingdom and the United States, in addition to enabling the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank of China to obtain licenses issued by the United Kingdom and the United States, and providing foreign exchange to Chinese and foreign merchants engaged in legitimate trade as usual, the Chinese government is also negotiating with the British and American authorities to designate the Central Bank to handle remittances from overseas Chinese and to prevent these remittances from falling into Japanese hands. At the same time, it is further expanding the Foreign Exchange Committee, which is affiliated to the Ministry of Finance, and authorizing it to handle all matters related to the freezing of funds. The various decisions of the committee will be implemented by the Central Bank. It is generally believed that all decisions of the committee will focus on stabilizing the exchange rate, supplying foreign exchange for essential goods, and safeguarding legitimate trade, with particular emphasis on the Shanghai region.

The Black Market Exchange Rate in Shanghai Stabilized Yesterday. Since the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has made every effort to maintain it, the Shanghai exchange market has stabilized. Yesterday morning, the HSBC quotation remained unchanged, and the situation in the black market changed. Since Chinese and foreign banks supplied and sold foreign exchange continuously, and there were still Hong Kong telegrams for sale, the speculators stopped, and the market gradually became looser. The bank's opening selling price in the morning was 2 pence 84375 for British pounds and 4 yuan 78125 for US dollars. At the close, the British pound was 2 pence 9375 and the US dollar was 4 yuan 9375. In the afternoon, the opening and closing quotations for British and American exchanges were the same as the noon closing. The US dollar had once reached 9 yuan. Also yesterday afternoon, the opening price of the gold market was 7,070 yuan, the lowest was 7,010 yuan, and the closing price rose to 7,080 yuan. Generally speaking, it was still stable.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Funds, First Issue to Elementary School Students, Plan to Approve and Announce in Two Days, Foreign and Chinese Employees Voluntarily Donate

The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund has been working on the investigation recently, concentrating the efforts of most people, and has completed seventy or eighty percent of the work. The investigation team, considering that most elementary schools in the city have already started school earlier than middle and high schools, and that tuition fees are paid in advance, in order to meet actual needs, the elementary school part will first go through the approval procedures, and it is scheduled to be approved by the committee on the 15th, and the list of names will be announced first, and the scholarships will be issued. Elementary school students who have applied should pay special attention. Yesterday, donations reached more than 2,000 yuan. In addition to 500 yuan from Zhu's residence, there were also people from the Yingpai Condensed Milk and Letu Precision Milk Powder guilds, and people from a foreign factory in Yangshupu, all of whom voluntarily donated. Their kindness is commendable. In addition, there are students who have applied after the deadline. In order to expedite the procedures, this newspaper will not be able to accommodate them. Please apply early next semester to avoid missing the deadline.

New Jian Middle School Sets Up Free Quotas. A letter from New Jian Middle School, which has been specially approved by the Ministry of Education, states: "Dear Sir, the number of students in this city who are struggling to study due to their living environment is increasing day by day. Your newspaper is mindful of this and has initiated the Readers' Scholarship Fund to benefit poor students. This kind of warm heart and perseverance is truly admirable. Therefore, our school has decided to set up Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship quotas in the second part of Hadong Road, with three students each in the first and second grades of high school, and one student each in the first, second, and third grades of junior high school. If there are students who are determined to study and are introduced to our school by your newspaper after passing the examination, they will be exempted from all tuition fees to support this grand undertaking. If the number of applicants exceeds the predetermined quota, please send the list of all applicants to our school, hold an examination, and select and admit students accordingly. We hope that you will investigate and handle this matter." This newspaper is very grateful for the kindness of New Jian Middle School and has determined the following accommodation measures: (1) All male and female students who believe that their academic ability is adequate can write a letter stating their detailed academic qualifications and family circumstances without filling out an application form. (2) All applicants should send their letters before the 17th of this month. If they are suitable, they will be invited to the newspaper office for an interview. If they are not suitable, we will not reply.

Milk Powder Association Supports Scholarships. A letter from Mr. Lin Fuqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Association of Eagle Brand Condensed Milk and Letu Refined Milk Powder, states: "Dear Sir, since your newspaper has launched the scholarship fund, all sectors have responded enthusiastically, and the results have been excellent, which is deeply admirable. The colleagues of our association all agree that your newspaper's move is very practical and benefits the country and society deeply and greatly. Therefore, after discussion by all members of our association, we have decided to allocate 500 yuan in national currency to help in a small way, to promote your initiative, and hope that you will redouble your efforts to further promote and expand it. This is what we hope for."

Factory Employees are Greatly Inspired. A letter from Mr. Wei Jiqiang from a foreign factory in Yangshupu is very touching. It says: "The scholarship fund established by your newspaper provides a ray of hope for outstanding young people who have dropped out of school, and cultivates talents for society. Its significance is profound and its organization is meticulous, which is truly admirable. Due to the limitations of my economic ability, I was only able to enjoy four years of secondary education. Driven by life, I entered the factory of a certain foreign company last year as an apprentice, with meager pay and working all day long, resembling a coolie, and being looked down upon everywhere. The main reason for this is the lack of sufficient education. Therefore, I deeply understand the pain of young people who have dropped out of school and express my sympathy. Now, in my spare time, I have been working hard to appeal to the engineers, staff, and apprentices in the factory. However, under the company's restrictions and surveillance, I can only do it secretly. Thanks to the enthusiastic donations of many warm-hearted people, more than 200 yuan has been raised, which is a very small amount. But in such a large city, there are many wealthy gentlemen and profiteers. If they can generously donate to help poor students, the effect will be very great."

Bank Colleagues Respond Continuously. Recently, the banking community has been very interested in this newspaper's scholarship fund. Several banks have already donated. We believe that if the financial community can provide assistance, it will greatly increase the strength, and any undertaking will be successful. Assisting scholarships is a small matter. Yesterday, the Asia Bank Xiahai Road branch sent a letter saying, "Dear Sir, we have read about the 'Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund' organized by your newspaper, and we are filled with admiration. In order to encourage and popularize education, our bank has specially donated 200 yuan in national currency to express our support."

Donations Exceed 2,000 Yuan Yesterday. 500 yuan from Zhu's residence, 500 yuan from colleagues of the Shanghai Eagle Brand Condensed Milk Association, 500 yuan from colleagues of the Shanghai Letu Refined Milk Powder Association, 227 yuan from colleagues of a certain factory, 200 yuan from Mr. Fang Zhaorong, 200 yuan from the Asia Bank Xiahai Road branch, 33 yuan and 50 cents from an anonymous person, 10 yuan from Mr. Ma Bendo, 10 yuan from Miss Shi, and 8 yuan from Zhiliao, totaling 2,188 yuan and 50 cents. Previously saved 44,577 yuan, 7 jiao and 8 fen, total: 46,766 yuan, 2 jiao and 8 fen.

### Two University Students Applying for Aid

One Completed a Perilous Journey, One Fell into the Abyss of Sorrow

It probably isn't too unusual for university students to apply for aid. That's what we initially thought because progressing step by step from primary school to middle school and then to university suggests the family's situation isn't too bad. However, in reality, although the number of university students applying isn't as high as that of primary and middle school students, it is still considerable. The following account describes two cases of university students that I interviewed.

Fifteen Years of Work-Study

When I met university student E and listened to his account, I was genuinely moved. His experiences read like a story. If you have read the autobiographies of Yung Wing or Kwong Ki Chiu about their work-study experiences overseas, you can imagine E’s experiences. His spirit of perseverance and self-improvement is a source of pride and the most brilliant chapter in his life.

A sturdy, not very tall figure, with a capable and promising demeanor, revealed an exceptionally sincere face. After a brief exchange of greetings, he began to recount his fifteen-year work-study career. He was born in a village in Jieyang County, Guangdong Province. His father was a farmer, toiling diligently, but each year's harvest was barely enough to feed the family. When he was eleven years old, his father sent him alone to Sarawak in Borneo, in Southeast Asia. From then on, he drifted abroad and never returned to his hometown. He is twenty-six years old this year. In these fifteen years, which cannot be said to be short, he never received any financial assistance from his family. Relying on his robust body and using his hands and mind, he progressed day by day, enduring hardships and experiencing the taste of both sweetness and bitterness. Working and studying at the same time, he managed to complete primary and secondary school. He is now a medical student. When he started his wandering life at the age of eleven, his young heart was not traumatized. Instead, through various trials, everything became firm, and he completed this most arduous journey of life.

In the Philippines, when he couldn't pay his tuition, he did all kinds of odd jobs at school, even helping the chief steward in the kitchen to cook. In this way, he earned some wages to pay off his tuition. Mentally, he was, of course, very happy, and his classmates never looked down on him. After studying hard for several years, he accumulated more than a hundred Philippine pesos from his work, which, at the current exchange rate, is equivalent to about one thousand yuan in national currency. To pursue further studies, he went to Shanghai last year and was admitted to the most famous missionary university, specializing in medicine. He admits that he was nurtured by society and should repay it with all his energy. That is why he is studying medicine, hoping to become a doctor who serves the people.

The coursework at medical school is quite demanding. If he were to work again, he would not be able to devote himself fully to his studies. Although he is still working as a tutor, the income is not much, barely enough to cover his own expenses for books, clothing, and food for half a year.

I looked at his academic record, which was not bad; then I noticed his conduct, the form said "Excellent," followed by the medical school dean's signature.

E's words satisfied me. How could I not help such a university student? As I respectfully said goodbye, I wished him a bright future.

Father Developed a Mental Illness

C is also a student at this missionary university. He was already waiting in the reception room shortly after E left.

His father used to work in the income tax office. The family of six lived quite comfortably. After the outbreak of the war, the joyful atmosphere of the family suddenly turned into a gloomy scene. His father lost his job and relied on a meager fifty yuan for living expenses to support the family. Of course, this was not enough. If it were not for some previous savings, who knows what would have happened? After being unemployed, his father suffered some shock and is now suffering from mental illness, losing his senses. He is drunk and dazed all day long and cannot manage anything. The family's biggest worry now is a huge medical bill. Tuition for the next semester is certainly not in the budget. In fact, there is no way to budget for it!

"Don't you have an uncle?"

"Yes, he works in a bank, and his income is okay, but he has many children, all of whom are in school. Every time school starts, my uncle is also worried!"

"If we can't approve your application, what do you plan to do?"

"...C looked dejected.

C is nineteen years old this year and will be entering his second year of university next semester, majoring in chemistry. I imagined his happy and fulfilling childhood, which at least has temporarily disappeared now. In fact, C doesn't have to worry. Isn't his esteemed classmate E in medical school a good example? Just work hard! (A)

### Gasoline Price Increase

Price Hikes Five Cents per Gallon, Automobile Fares Will Increase Slightly

According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", the American oil companies, Mobil and Texaco, have increased the price of gasoline from four yuan to four yuan and five cents per gallon, starting yesterday (the 12th). It is generally expected that taxi fares will increase accordingly. According to personnel from a major taxi company, since the price of gasoline has increased, taxi fares will also be adjusted and slightly increased without a doubt. However, no final decision has been made yet. Major taxi companies need to hold a meeting before they can announce a definite plan.

### Foreign Nationals in Shanghai Do Not Intend to Evacuate Actively, A Few Departed by Ship Yesterday and Will Return to America Tomorrow Afternoon

The degree of tension in the Far East situation can be seen from the movements of foreign nationals here. According to the British and American side, the United Kingdom and United States have very large rights in Shanghai, and they will not easily abandon their interests even if the situation reaches a final critical juncture. A reporter from Ping Ming News Agency specifically inquired at the Swiss Consulate in Shanghai yesterday about the country's evacuation plans.

Swiss Consul States No Evacuation of Nationals. According to a responsible official at the consulate, there are no preparations for evacuating nationals here. All kinds of rumors are not reliable. However, among the three hundred-plus Japanese nationals, forty or fifty intend to evacuate on their own and have requested assistance from the Tokyo consulate. The Tokyo Swiss Consulate telegraphed here to inquire whether American ships were available to conveniently transport these people to America. Here, efforts began to charter ships and inquire among Swiss nationals who wished to leave Shanghai whether they could also take the opportunity to evacuate. There are a total of two hundred and fifty Swiss nationals in Shanghai, mostly merchants. Throughout China, including Shanghai, there are a total of five hundred and fifty people, mostly missionaries in the occupied areas. As of now, no nationals have expressed a desire to evacuate. The chartering of ships has also been unsuccessful. The so-called evacuation of Swiss nationals may have originated from this. The authorities have not heard of any official evacuation matters. Even the evacuation of Swiss nationals residing in Japan is voluntary, and all travel expenses are entirely their own responsibility.

Reports of Dutch Ships Halting Service Are Entirely False. According to a responsible person at the Dutch Consulate, there are only over two hundred Dutch nationals in total. Fewer than ten are in the occupied areas and are all missionaries. Their decision to evacuate is purely voluntary and limited to women and children. As for professionals, they should still continue to stay here. Only dozens of people evacuated yesterday on the "Tjipondok" ship, mostly evacuating to Batavia. As for Tianjin, details of the evacuation are not yet known here, but the number of nationals there is even smaller. As of now, Dutch ships sailing between the Dutch East Indies and Shanghai are still sailing according to the scheduled routes and there is no such thing as halting services. Given the unpredictable changes in the situation, he also found it very difficult to predict future developments. For example, during the August 13th Incident, there was a Dutch ship that left port for other destinations before it even unloaded its cargo.

"President Coolidge" Ship to Leave Shanghai Tomorrow. The American President Lines' "President Coolidge," after being requisitioned by the government and sailing back to its home country more than a month ago, arrived in Shanghai again last night from America via the Philippines. However, its requisition order has not been rescinded. It is understood that two hundred and fifty people in Shanghai have reserved cabins on the ship, and the date of departure will be noon tomorrow. The Shanghai branch of the American President Lines has remained silent about the "President Coolidge" resuming its voyages to Shanghai, and its exact departure time is also being kept secret.

Many Impoverished American Nationals Have Not Left Shanghai. Yesterday, a reporter inquired with officials at the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai about the U.S. State Department's consideration of evacuating American nationals in the Far East and impoverished nationals in Shanghai. It was stated that there are indeed many American nationals in Shanghai who cannot afford to purchase tickets to evacuate and return home. Although the consulate authorities are willing to assist them in leaving Shanghai, very few have officially requested assistance from the consulate. Of course, most people still want to stay in Shanghai, or do not want to let people know that they do not have the financial means to purchase tickets to return home. However, the exact number of such nationals cannot be ascertained. It was also reported that the total number of American nationals in Shanghai was originally over 4,000. Since the gradual evacuation began last autumn, only about half remain in Shanghai, mostly men who need to stay in Shanghai. There are indeed many women and children who have returned to their home country.

Japanese Nationals Organized Smuggling Ring. Smuggling Cash. Nagasaki Japanese Police Discovered It, Shanghai Japanese Consulate Reported It

According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, Hayashi Takitaro (42), a Japanese businessman from Shanghai’s Jiading Road, and his wife (27) returned to Japan on the 5th of last month aboard the Nagasaki Maru. They secretly carried 30,000 yuan in cash using clever methods, but were discovered by the Nagasaki police due to careless actions. The Nagasaki police transferred the case to the Shanghai Japanese Consulate Police Department for investigation. The investigation revealed that they had organized a smuggling ring to transport cash, with Mori Juro (38), an employee of the Nagasaki Post Office, acting as the liaison. As a result, they were reported to the authorities. More than ten people have been arrested in Shanghai and Dalian. It has now been determined that they have secretly transported a total of 150,000 yuan in cash back to Japan.

Crime Reduced in French Concession in July

The number of criminal cases in the French Concession in June had already decreased significantly compared to the previous months, and July saw even fewer cases than June. This month, there were two murder cases and one attempted murder case (there were three murder cases in June). One of the deceased was a gangster, who was killed on Balikiao Road on July 10th. The other was a Chinese military officer who had just arrived in Shanghai from Songjiang a few days ago. He was suddenly killed on Grosvenor Road on July 21st. The deceased had been attacked in Songjiang before, and he was unharmed, but his wife was killed. It was determined that the perpetrator had followed him from another location to Shanghai. At the time of the incident, the perpetrator exchanged gunfire with the police, wounding a Vietnamese constable, but was eventually captured by the constables on duty at the intersection of Route Haig and Route Say Zoong.

There were five robbery cases and one attempted robbery case in July (there were nine in June). Only July 1939 had a similar low record. Two of the cases have been solved, and one thief has been apprehended.

### Business News. The American Dollar in Financial Markets Reached Five Yuan Before Dropping Back Down. Sassoon in Hong Kong Sells Out…The Weakening Trend in the Aftermarket Moderately Dampened

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's posted rates remain flat across all currencies. In the unofficial market, the U.S. dollar and British pound weakened significantly. After the Hong Kong Exchange Equalization Fund offered a huge amount of U.S. dollars for sale the day before yesterday, domestic and foreign merchants in Shanghai also improved their supply intentions. HSBC's small counter lengthened the U.S. dollar by 0.0625 to 4.8125 yuan. Speculators had already stopped bidding and were taking profits. Therefore, under the selling pressure from the Hong Kong Exchange and Chinese banks on the mainland, the U.S. dollar weakened from 4.78125 yuan to 4.9375 yuan. The British pound also weakened to 2 shillings and 9.375 pence. The selling pressure surged even more in the afternoon, with Sassoon selling off, pushing the U.S. dollar down to 5.03125 yuan. The British pound was the weakest, and a settlement could be made at 2 shillings and 9.6875 pence. Later, speculators turned to bidding, and HSBC absorbed at five yuan, causing it to immediately retreat within the range. The final gap was still huge, and the entire day's trading was extremely active.

The Opening Showed Weakening

Since the morning, foreign news from banks showed only a slight lengthening in forward-month silver, while recent and American silver markets were flat. The exchange rate of various currencies against the Shanghai dollar was one cent and one point smaller for the American dollar, with the remaining rates unchanged. Central's posted rates for various currencies remained unchanged. Early in the day, the opening selling price from domestic banks was 2 shillings and 8.4375 pence for spot British pounds and 4.78125 yuan for U.S. dollars. The opening immediately showed weakening. Foreign banks' intention to supply was very loose, and the rate was immediately low. Importers were able to settle U.S. dollars at 4.8125 yuan, which was the same as the upper price from HSBC's small counter, lengthening the U.S. dollar by 0.0625. The silver balancing tax was levied at 24.25 percent. Hong Kong Exchange came to sell a huge amount at 4.875 yuan. Speculators also came to sell at the upper price. Banks were mostly intended to absorb, and the gold price fell again. News that the mainland was also selling August at 4.90625 yuan caused speculators to find it difficult to sell at 4.9375 yuan. By the noon close, it had strengthened to a settlement rate, and the British pound also weakened to 2 shillings and 9.375 pence.

Chinese Merchants Bid Up to Five Yuan

In the afternoon, the Hong Kong Exchange's intention to supply was weak, while Chinese banks and speculators were eagerly selling August U.S. dollars at 4.96875 yuan. News that Sassoon was taking profits caused speculators to bid up again to five yuan. The weakest sale was by Sassoon to a foreign bank at 5.03125 yuan, but soon Chinese merchants turned to forcefully bid up to five yuan, immediately stopping the weakening and returning to the five yuan range. Before the evening close, it was difficult to obtain even 4.96875 yuan, causing the British pound to also strengthen to 3 shillings and 9.6875 pence, which was difficult to settle. The market closed at 3:30 PM, with spot to September British pounds at 2 shillings and 9.375 pence and U.S. dollars at 4.9375 yuan, a lengthening of 0.09375 for British pounds and 0.15625 for U.S. dollars compared to the previous day's close.

### A Sudden Move in the Exchange Market Dimmed the Luster of Gold

Yesterday’s unofficial gold market saw a sudden reversal after the rising trend had subsided. Prices retreated close to the 7,000 yuan mark. This was due to a sharp weakening in foreign exchange and rumors that the United States would evacuate its nationals from the Far East, causing widespread unease. Although Hong Kong firms initially purchased 6,000 taels, the selling pressure from Shanghai’s western firms, along with gold shops, exchange dealers, securities firms, and retail investors, caused prices to decline sharply from an opening of 7,180 yuan, falling below 7,100 yuan by noon. In the afternoon, as the U.S. dollar strengthened to over five yuan, a consistent selling trend pushed prices down to a low of 7,020 yuan. Unexpectedly, HSBC absorbed U.S. dollars, causing the five-yuan level to be regained. Hong Kong firms then purchased another 5,000 taels, and with today afternoon at one o'clock marking the roll-over date (August moving into September), rumors of sellers having to pay buyers a huge amount, above seventy yuan, caused short sellers to refrain from prolonged exposure, leading to renewed purchases. This created a seventy-yuan increase, ultimately settling at one hundred and forty yuan, less sharp than the weakening in foreign exchange. As a result, settlement prices in U.S. dollars have already been pushed up. Total trading volume exceeded 100,000 taels, and cash prices continued to decline slightly. Xianghe sold 300 taels from De Fu, and silver shops sold 100 taels from gold shops at a price of 8,800 yuan. In the afternoon, there was supply but no demand at the upper price, settling at fifty yuan. This caused decorative gold to also retreat to 900 yuan, less ten yuan.

Forward Lending Declined by One Hundred and Forty Yuan

Since the morning, the opening price for each tael (ten liang) at 9:15 AM was 7,180 yuan, which was forty yuan lower than the previous day's noon closing price. This was because the price had already been lowered after the previous day's evening close. Foreign exchange weakened, and amidst buying pressure from Hengji and selling pressure from Mei Yuan, Dingsheng, Tianyuan, Chi Da, Yi Da, Xinfeng, Yong, and Xianghe, prices immediately retreated by eighty yuan, falling to the 7,100 yuan level. At 9:45 AM, Yi Da, Xinfeng Yong, and Li Tailai re-entered purchasing, and Dafeng, Hengji, and Chengji also bought, raising the price to 7,145 yuan. However, as foreign exchange continued to weaken, another decline began around 11:00 AM. Xianghe, Hengji, Hesheng, Xinfeng Yong, and Yiyuan eagerly sold, and with news of the United States evacuating its nationals in Japan, prices fell again by sixty to seventy yuan, breaking through 7,100 yuan, further decreasing to 7,070 yuan. The noon close was 7,072 yuan. The afternoon opened at 7,070 yuan, a decrease of two yuan. Xiang Xing Yong, Yiyuan, Tianyuan, Yi Da, De Fu, and Xinfeng Yong successively sold forcefully, and the U.S. dollar strengthened to five days, causing prices to gradually decrease by fifty yuan, retreating to 7,020 yuan. Hong Kong firms suddenly came in with strong purchases, and Dacheng Yong, Xiang Xing Yong, Hengji, De Fu, Yi Da, and Xinfeng Yong all re-entered purchasing. Hearing that HSBC absorbed five yuan of the U.S. dollar, sentiment was boosted, and the price immediately soared by seventy yuan, rising to 7,090 yuan. Chi Da and Hesheng sold again, and the market closed at 3:30 PM at 7,080 yuan, a decline of one hundred and forty yuan from the previous day's close. This was a reaction after six consecutive days of increases, rising by 539 yuan. Based on the August U.S. dollar settlement price of 4.9375 yuan, it was 7,053 yuan, which has already been raised by twenty-seven yuan. After the closing, Tianyuan and others sold down to 7,055 yuan. Tong Kang Yong bought, with the final price at 7,060 yuan. The daily range was one hundred and sixty yuan. Cash brand gold was sold at 8,851 yuan per tael in stores, and the closing price was reduced by two yuan. Spot gold had no price and no market.

Decorative Gold Has Also Been Reduced by Ten Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops was reduced by ten yuan at 11:00 AM by Datonghang and Xintonghang, to nine hundred yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by forty yuan.

### Securities. Bulls Still Do Not Give Up Pulling Up Domestic Debt. Gradually Declined in the Afternoon

In the unofficial market for public bonds, yesterday's market saw even clearer transactions and even fewer trades. The market situation was still in a state of fluctuation. The bulls tried their best to pull up prices, taking advantage of the low volume of transactions to buy in at higher prices, creating opportunities for sellers. Class C bonds were once pulled up to 7.90 yuan, and a number of short sellers covered their positions. The market situation temporarily presented a firm and stable picture. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere suddenly became sluggish, and the trend still did not escape fluctuation. Yesterday morning, Lianyi, Runde, and Hongda bought in at higher prices, while Zhongfu, Yitai, Dechang, and Jiufeng sold, with Jiufeng selling the most. The noon close was raised by three dimes. In the afternoon, Gongmao, Dahua, and Hongtai bought in, while De Fu, Xinchang, and Delong sold out. The buyers lacked the strength to pull up prices, and the market situation suddenly turned downwards. As a result, Class A and B bonds decreased by about one dime, while Class C and E bonds were better by one or two dimes. The trading volume was only eight or nine hundred thousand. A brief table is listed below. Today is the anniversary of August 13th, and the market is closed for one day.

In stock trading, thirty shares of Guanshengyuan stock were traded at a price of 85 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn: New Factory Orders Seen on the Market, Double Horse Yarn Price Trends Waver

The yarn market is still in a state of fluctuation. Although yarn transactions are not booming, sporadic purchases are still providing support, so market sentiment is cautiously optimistic. However, sellers are inclined to sell at high prices due to the unpredictable international situation, and recently new factory orders have been seen on the market, which inevitably increases the supply. However, the price of 32-count single yarn has gradually increased, making it relatively cheap compared to 20-count yarn. Considering the stable raw material prices, the current yarn market seems to be at a crossroads. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was $1,612, and the low price was $1,593. The initial transaction price in the afternoon was $1,598, rising to $1,607, and the final price was $1,603.4. Today is August 13th, and the spot market is closed. There are currently 1,655 pieces of yarn being shipped to Hong Kong.

The morning opening for Double Horse yarn was peaceful, with an initial price of $1,598. Once this price was set, the market felt even more ordinary. The price fluctuated between $97 and $98 for quite some time. Margin calls decreased, and foreign exchange rates lengthened. At this time, the selling pressure in the market was not strong, so short positions held by speculators, seeing the disadvantage of shorting, rushed to cover their positions, and the market rebounded. At the same time, spot sales were still strong, rising to $1,612. Then, profit-taking caused the price to fall back to $1,597. By the close of trading, the price was still strong, remaining at $1,602. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:

Regarding the Double Horse futures market, the trend gradually moved upwards amidst fluctuations. The morning opening was influenced by the continued decline in US cotton prices, causing the spot yarn market to weaken. Various groups showed little interest in buying, and there was a lot of selling pressure from floating long positions and scattered short positions. Therefore, the August contract opened at $1,455, a decrease of $5, and the September contract opened at $1,532, a further decrease of $3. When the October contract opened, it showed signs of rising, so it opened at $1,546, an increase of $2. Especially in the second trading session, although foreign exchange and gold prices fell, the spot yarn market behaved abnormally due to continued buying by large players, leading to an upward trend. For a time, yarn market sentiment improved, buyers emerged, and market prices soared. The August contract reached $1,465, the September contract rose to $1,540, and the October contract rose to $1,555. Later, some floating long positions were released, and the afternoon closing price slightly decreased, with the August contract at $1,460, unchanged, the September contract at $1,534, a slight decrease of $1, and the October contract at $1,545, a slight increase of $1. The fluctuations in the afternoon were small, and trading became particularly scarce, with prices fluctuating only within a range of $3 to $5. However, the potential of buyers was stronger, and the support level seemed quite firm. As a result, the August and September contracts each increased by $3, and the October contract increased by $7. Observing the trend, the foreign exchange and cash markets have been fluctuating for several days, but the yarn market is tied to actual sales. Although it has slightly increased, it has not broken out of the fluctuation pattern, so large players are particularly interested in buying on dips. Therefore, the support level for yarn prices seems more stable than in previous days, but traders are still concerned about the overall economic situation and international developments. A table of intraday market prices is listed below:

### US Cotton Trading at Its Peak: Both Importers of Brazilian Cotton and Factories Are Actively Procuring; The Highest Price for US Middling Cotton Reached $600

The spot market for imported cotton in Shanghai is quite active. Both importers and factories are showing interest in procurement. The ex-warehouse prices for high-grade Brazilian cotton and California cotton have been above $540 for several days. Yong An Textile Factory, in particular, has shown the greatest interest, transacting no less than 1,000 bales. In addition, there have been transactions in US cotton and US Middling cotton, with the highest price reaching $600. The lively situation is evident from this. However, general import orders from foreign firms are still stalled due to the complex and unpredictable international situation and the decline in downstream demand for US cotton.

The New York cotton market is weak due to a lack of buyers. At the same time, it has suffered a sharp decline due to good cotton harvests and weakness in New Orleans. As a result, the closing price was 22-23 points lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to mass selling and reports of Indian monsoon winds, but subsequently rebounded slightly due to some short covering. Yesterday's closing prices were each about 1 Rupee higher. It is predicted that the market will continue to decline by 1 Rupee at the opening today.

Regarding the current cotton situation, fine cotton remains firm as always, but coarse cotton is not as popular due to delayed demand and relatively abundant inventory. Therefore, the market conditions are far less brisk than those for fine cotton.

Piece Goods: Fine Yarn and Silk Raw Materials Are Too Expensive; Shirting Production Is Difficult

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market saw continued strong export sales, and demand from traders and importers was also good. Factory inventories have been greatly reduced, so the trend is unusually firm. The selling prices of twill and coarse/fine cloth rose by $0.25 to $0.50, and bleached/dyed cloth rose by about $0.50. Among fine yarn products, 60-count and 80-count shirting are the most popular. Due to the high cost of raw materials, factories are finding it difficult to start producing new goods. There is a shortage of finished goods on the market, leading to speculation and price increases, with each piece rising by $2-3. Transactions on Wood Street included nearly 1,000 pieces of various cloths. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang traders purchased over 500 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and khaki cloth, etc. Traders from the northern routes of Yanjing purchased over 100 pieces of flannel and other goods.

Eastern Cloth: Selling prices have consistently increased. As a result, the price of leading fine cloth rose by $0.05, medium-grade fine cloth rose by $0.20 to $0.45, twill rose by $0.30 to $0.50, and jean rose by $0.04 to $0.05 per yard. The final price for new orders with new taxes was $1.812 per head.

Exports: Today, 100 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Tianjin, and another 10,500 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Grain: Rice Arrivals Steady, Attempts to Raise Prices Unsuccessful

Yesterday, imported rice was initially popular but then declined, with market prices falling by $1-2. The reason was that importers were still greedy in the early market and continued the active buying momentum from the previous day, making the market appear quite strong. Subsequently, more than 60,000 bags of rice shipped from Shantou and other places arrived in port, and a few were about to be imported, seeking sales in the market. However, importers did not show interest because transportation in the mainland was inconvenient due to the 8/13 martial law. In addition to the supply of Hong Kong rice in this street, the French Concession warned against raising prices, and demand also weakened slightly. With sluggish actual sales and no international stimulation, speculators and new importers were hesitant to act, and floating sellers took advantage of high prices to seek sales, so the market immediately turned from popular to declining. Xiaojiao Yanghua Rice decreased from $150 to $149, and No. 2 Rice decreased from $143 to $142, with few buyers. Only more than 300 tons were transacted. The spot closing prices were: No. 1 Saigon Rice $134-135, Zhongguan Rice $133-132.5, No. 2 Chenbai Rice $127.5-$126.5, Huojiao Rice $132, Jiafo Rice $131, Zhongguan Rice $128, Min Dang Special White Rice $140, Zhongguan White Rice $131-128, Sub-grade $115-116, No. 1 Siam Rice $132-$130, No. 2 Rice $121-$120, Xiaojiao Bank Warehouse White Rice $123.5-$123, Foreign Warehouse $122.5-$122, Huowen Rice $116, Broken Tip $95-$93, Sub-grade $88.

Although there was still not much thick and thin Japonica rice, national rice, and new Japonica sealed goods, sellers still tried to sell them, but local shops' interest waned due to the fatigue of imported rice, making it difficult for the market to rebound, and it was just flat. It is estimated that the fresh early and late rice from Nanyang Port was still $156-$154, Wuxi original package white Japonica rice was $150-$148, medium grade was $144, and 13 dan of Pudong new Japonica rice were transacted, with a price of $150.

The glutinous rice market had little change due to balanced supply and demand. Hong Kong white Yuan Gao white rice was $127-$126.5, Zhongguan Rice $124, Glutinous Lv rice $115-$113. Yesterday, national glutinous rice from factories was quoted at $128-129.

More than 60,000 bags of imported rice arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that Taikoo Company's Jiaying Wheel also arrived at the port the night before last, with 12,219 bags of imported rice loaded from Siam. The ship is temporarily docked in Pudong and will be moved to the Puxi wharf within days to unload.

Flour Market Revives - Market Closed for One Day on August 13th -

The spot market for imported flour has revived, as the Japanese import group has gradually improved its appetite, and there are rumors that Hong Kong shipping is being blocked, causing anxiety. Near noon, there was a large speculator showing interest, and the market's support level was quite stable. Jinlong Flour opened at $32.56, once raised to $32.90, and finally closed at $32.70, while Fort Flour was $33.90, Banana Brand $33.20, up two or three corners from before. There was also Clock Tower Flour, Taikoo Warehouse $34.30, with a total transaction of no less than 30,000 bags. Actual sales and speculators each accounted for half. It is said that the Miscellaneous Grains Association will close the market on August 13th, and it is also said that the retail price of each bag of old car flour is $34.80, Fuxin $34.80, Flower Bird $35, and Steamer $34.80.

Due to the 8/13 martial law period, the source of new wheat was extremely scarce, and each factory had very little stock. The market had an invisible state of stagnation.

Sugar Market: Coarse Car White Rice Falls, Dutch Red Rice Rises Alone

Yesterday, the sugar market fell because there was a rumor that Dutch ships might resume sailing, so the source would not be interrupted. Company futures for 24 groups of white rice on August 20 were $115.8, $114.7, and $115.9, down $2. The end of August was $119, $118, and $117.7, down $3. The tripartite market, spot 2 called groups of white rice arriving in July were $117.5 to $116.5, down $2, June was $116.5 to $115.7, May was $115.5 to $114.8, and April was $114.5. The rise of Dutch rice has not ended. KD mark May arrivals were $112 to $115, up another $3. Taikoo Car White B mark was $139, down $5, and HX mark was $120, down $2.

A large batch of granulated sugar was shipped north. Today, 11,000 bags of sugar were loaded onto Taikoo Company's Chongqing and New Beijing ships to Tianjin, and another 740 bags were loaded onto the Anshun ship to Xiamen.

### Oil Market: Dalian Oil Held Tightly, Black Market Price $280

Yesterday's edible oil market still showed a shortage of goods, and people were still nervous. Those who held the goods continued to speculate, only because Dalian soybean oil was held tightly, and the black market price reached as high as $280. The prices of all goods uniformly rose by $2 to $3.5. The unified market sold 20 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil at a price of $275, 600 cans of Jiangbei local workshop raw oil at a price of $260, 1,200 dan of Dayou Qing oil at a price of $182 to $185, 800 dan of rapeseed oil at a price of $187 to $190, 50 barrels of Yoshida rapeseed oil at a price of $183, 300 barrels of Rihua rapeseed oil at a price of $174 to $176, and September delivery was $183.5 to $185, and 500 dan of Lide rapeseed oil at a price of $174 to $177, and September delivery was $182.

Medicinal Materials: Dried Lily Bulbs Fall Back

Recently, there have been continuous arrivals of dried lily bulbs, with supply exceeding demand, and the market situation has suddenly loosened. It was found that new products were once sold for $155, but now they are $135, and there are not many buyers, with a decrease of about $20. The market situation is flat and soft.

Yunnan Provincial Department of Education Plans to Establish an Educational Specialization Course

(Kunming Puxun) The Yunnan Provincial Department of Education plans to establish an educational specialization course because the number of secondary schools in the province is gradually increasing and the need for educational talent is quite urgent. In addition to contacting the Southwest Associated University Teachers College to send four students from each department to study, it also entrusted the college to run an educational specialization course, which is divided into three groups: literature, mathematics, and history, with a provisional quota of 50 students per group. After graduating in two years and completing one year of internship, they will be officially assigned to various schools to serve as teachers. It is reported that this can be realized when the Southwest Associated University starts school next year. (Shenjiang Society)

### The Lives of Street Children in the Isolated Island

— Da Rong

They Can Cheat, Can Scheme, and Can Make Money - It Is Hoped That Society Will Pay More Attention

There are too many street children on the isolated island: near the docks are those who pick up rice grains, those who push carts up and down the bridges; near the playgrounds and cinemas are those who watch cars; there are even more petty thieves, beggars, scavengers, newsboys, and child beggars.

The lives of these street children are very unstable, especially the petty thieves. The source of their money is from pickpocketing or cutting open bags. They are particularly vigilant, and often several of them work together to steal: one person stands by the roadside making strange movements, which can attract a crowd of onlookers in three to five minutes, and this is their opportunity to strike. The money they steal is always spent within fourteen hours, they use it as they earn it. If they don't spend it all, they will be reported by another thief out of jealousy if discovered, and they will be beaten and face lawsuits.

There are many ways to spend money: eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling are all done. Don't look down on them, they are only thirteen or fourteen years old, but they have already learned these habits, which is caused by society. Before they become petty thieves, they must first apprentice to a master (they call him "Grand Uncle"). They only accept those who pass the master's examination, and whose intelligence and physical strength are up to par. After being accepted, they are forced to swear not to reveal any information, and then they are taught the methods of pickpocketing. The apprentice must pay the Grand Uncle a certain amount of money every day, even if he doesn't pickpocket anything, he must find a way to pay. Under this threat, they have no choice but to work hard.

As for the beggars' methods of begging for money, there are now more and more tricks. Some who directly ask for money from people are not noticed.

One day I saw a beggar on Jing'an Temple Road, about ten years old, crying very pitifully, and I couldn't help but reach out and give him a dime. But a few days later I found him in the same place again, still crying, crying as badly as last time. Later I heard that this child had been taken in by a charitable organization. It turned out that he specialized in crying to make money, and he could earn eight or nine yuan a day.

Speaking of scavenging street children, once I was sitting in my room, and I saw three scavenging street children under the window facing the street, gnawing on discarded watermelon rinds. They even used the deep green layer to wipe their faces. Aroused my sympathy, I wanted to know more about their real lives, but how could I approach them? Then I remembered that when I sorted the letters in the morning, there were many invalid waste papers. I took these scraps of paper downstairs and delivered them to the door, and sure enough, all three children ran over.

"Won't you fight?" I asked.

"No, we will share it with everyone," one child replied.

"I'm very happy: How old are you?"

"Fourteen years old."

Who else is at home?

"There are Dad, Mom, and older sister."

"What do they do?"

"Dad pulls a rickshaw, Mom does mending for others, and older sister is sick."

"That's so sad! How much money can you earn scavenging every day?"

"A little more than a yuan."

"What did you do before the war?"

"I went to school then."

"Do you still want to go to school?" His eyes suddenly lit up and said: "Of course I do, but I don't have any money!"

I can introduce you to a place where you don't have to learn to beg, where you have food to eat and a place to live, and where you can learn crafts in addition to studying. How about it? "I have to go back and ask my mom if she agrees."

"Okay, then I'll wait for you for two days. Come back and give me an answer at half past two tomorrow or the day after tomorrow."

At 2:30 PM on the third day, that child really came again. He said very disappointedly, "Mom and Dad won't let me go to school because I still have to support the family."

Shanghai is so big, and there are tens of thousands of street children. They are now children, and they are also the backbone of future society. Now they beg, now they commit crimes, what will be the result in the future?

Refreshing Anecdotes

### Men, Bedbugs, Women

— Qian Changnian

A pair of lovers who had not yet lived together, occasionally argued over a trivial matter, which gradually escalated out of control. The woman declared that she would no longer pay attention to the other party, and the man also vowed not to step into her doorway.

Humans are, after all, emotional animals, especially young men and women in love. Not to mention her, she had been sniffling and crying after only a day or two, waiting anxiously at the door all day long, hoping that he would immediately send a letter of apology and forgiveness.

Her wish was fulfilled on the seventh day after the argument, although it was only a week, her heels had grown two inches because of this. She hurriedly tore open the letter and read it. The letter said:

"My dear: I really can't stand it anymore. I haven't been able to sleep every night these past few days, and I've lost weight beyond recognition..."

When she saw this, she couldn't help wiping her tears with a handkerchief, and didn't bother to read on. She stuffed the letter into her pocket. Without waiting to bargain, she called for a rickshaw to the man's house.

He happened to be coming out, and greeted her with a smile when he saw her. Although he had lost some weight, he was very energetic, which made her even more strange and uncomfortable: he never said a word of apology.

So, she had to mention the letter she had received with a thick face, while secretly looking at his expression.

"Oh! Have you read all the words in the letter? It's really hateful, those annoying bedbugs keep me up all night, and I'm in extreme pain. Darling, don't you think I've lost a lot of weight?"

"You mean the bedbugs?... Oh!" She fainted on the sofa chair with her umbrella.

Don't Touch Your Pockets - A Bin

Friends! In public places, don't touch your pockets if you don't need to. Because:

On the tram, pickpockets will think you have money in your pocket and rob you.

In the theater, the candy boys will stare at you, thinking you are a good customer.

On the street, you will become the target of beggars, who will regard you as a god of wealth.

### The Cat Said

— Jue Hui

I hate cats, not because their appearance is ugly or they meow creepily. For example, cats have a few long hairs below their noses and above their lips, and some people today also have a few; for example, cats can meow "meow meow" in a way that makes all the pores on my body open up, but people can do this too, and it's both creepy and "supposed to be interesting"!

So these two points cannot be the reason for hating cats.

Absolutely, honestly, what I hate is that cats specialize in "the strong eat the weak" as their specialty!

Catching mice, maybe the mice "deserve it"; birds, birds are innocent; swallowing goldfish, what is the crime of goldfish?

But when they see a dog, they run away in terror and don't even dare to look it in the eye.

Cats really make me feel "deep pain and utter disgust"!

### Begonia

XI - Midnight Song

Mei Bao now believed that what her father said during the day, "I'm afraid it won't be that easy," was not an overstatement.

Clutching a fearful heart, she quietly returned home. First, she listened at the door of the room and, knowing that her father had not been awakened, felt a little more at ease and climbed into her own pit in the dark.

From that night on, she herself was almost day and night weighed down with worries, while Shang Lao Er and the Meng shopkeeper's family took turns standing at the counter like secret agents every day, looking across the street, watching for the actions of Zhang Xiaogouzi, they also had to pay attention; it was not until Xiaogouzi's brother carried Mei Bao's luggage on the road that this tense situation was relaxed.

The principal of the county middle school was very sympathetic to Mei Bao's absence from Xiangfan for two months due to force majeure, and because her grades were usually very good, he couldn't bear to have her encounter unexpected setbacks before graduation, so he readily agreed to let her make up the lessons while continuing to attend classes with the class.

However, her dispute with Shang Lao Er was still handled entirely according to Shang Lao Er's wishes; every day, she always had to make an excuse to go out and delay for an hour or two, and continue to learn opera at the home of a colleague named Liu whom Shang Lao Er had known in his early years. After a few days, Shang Lao Er even asked someone to write a document himself, and taught Mei Bao to sign and put her fingerprints on it. Although Mei Bao saw that the conditions written on it were very fierce, and that she would almost have to sing until her voice was hoarse before she could break away from her master; she was, after all, a girl, and couldn't stand Shang Lao Er and the Liu family repeatedly threatening and enticing her, and she finally followed their words and completed this "wasteful and debauched" procedure.

But on the other hand, there were also additional matters that made her feel a little gratified: the first was that every time she learned opera at the Liu's house, everyone who came to visit, seeing her beautiful face and hearing her clear and melodious singing voice, almost all praised her, saying that "with such good material, the patriarch will definitely reward her!" The second was that she asked several classmates in the school who had been to big places like Beiping and Tianjin, and they all told her very sincerely that the costumes of the actors who sang in the big theaters were so gorgeous, and the reputations were so great, almost exactly the same as what Shang Lao Er said.

### Three Warriors

— Xian Ou

- Dragonfly - Spider - Bee -

When I was a child, I lived in the countryside, and I always found summer to be quite interesting. During the day, you could see a green field and hear the scratching cicada song. At night, you could admire the starry sky. The fireflies in the river and grass are like shuttles going back and forth.

Under the eaves, in the alleys, and between the pit sheds, there are many spider webs. If you are not careful, you will involuntarily wear a mask and cannot get rid of it for a while. Ah! It is so mischievous. Sometimes on the fence, in the bamboo forest, if you are not careful, you will touch the hornet's nest. Then a group of fighters will suddenly pounce on you. You can't resist, and you will be stabbed with one or two shots, which hurts so much that you don't know whether to laugh or cry.

What does not interfere with each other is that tens of thousands of dragonflies fly in the sky before a big thunderstorm, sometimes coming from the east and sometimes from the west, sometimes coming over and sometimes going low. It seems that it is chasing something, but I don't know what it is chasing? They are very much like modern warplanes. But they will never tear up foreign trash and have the danger of throwing bombs and killing people.

Later, I gradually realized that these three kinds of animals! Spiders, bees, dragonflies, are actually three kinds of warriors, fighting there every day for life. Among them, the dragonfly's combat method is the simplest. Relying on its natural biplane, when the big thunderstorm is approaching, it tries its best to chase its prisoners. Although it seems to be a group-style air raid, it is actually an opportunistic individual combat. It grabs the weak flying insects and uses them as black hearts. It is a pirate-style warrior of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.

The spider's combat strategy seems to be more clever. It is a naturally clumsy big-bellied merchant, but it has learned Liu Ji's "I would rather fight wits than fight strength." It uses thin lead wire nets to arrange a Bagua formation, making all directions and eight sides passable. Then, without saying a word, it sits in the center, waiting for work at ease. When the limited, ignorant flies, moths, mosquitoes, etc., touch the unlucky head and fall on its electric net, the more you move, the more you don't want to escape. The old man slowly and steadily comes to dismember you and eat you full.

And then there is the wasp. It builds its own camp, finds some plant nourishment, and constantly reproduces its offspring. It is committed to a non-aggression doctrine and does not seek trouble and slaughter. If people do not offend me, I will not offend them. If naughty children want to destroy its nest, it will rise up in a swarm and desperately "strike back against those who strike." It is a fighter for the self-defense of the race! 1

Sixty Years Later - Ye Jiale

Beggar: Sir! Please have mercy and give me a dollar to buy a sesame cake to eat.

Pedestrian: Okay! Take half a yuan!

Maid: Hey! Make me 50 cents of boiling water!

Tiger Stove Owner: Okay! A'er! Measure 50 O.O to her.

Guest: Why do you still have fluorescent lights? This is too old-fashioned.

Host: Brother! To tell you the truth, it's really because I'm short of money. Otherwise, I would have used the latest invention of the lamp long ago.

### A Bundle of Idle Talk - You Zuoxun

Father: The child is six years old. I can't afford the tuition, so you can teach him at home.

Mother: If I didn't teach him every day: east, west, north, south, and the middle of China, development of the developed, how would he know them so well?

Father...

A: Alas! Everything is soaring in price, how can people live? I want to swallow gold and commit suicide.

B... Creditor: I visited your residence the day before yesterday, and heard that your son had Nian's disease, so I did not disturb you. I wonder if he has recovered today?

Debtor: He's dead. In this kind of year, it's good for a debt collector to die!

Creditor...

Laugh It Off - Wen

The husband came down from upstairs, with a sweat undershirt over his arm. He glared at his wife and then looked at his son.

Husband: That brat stole the money from my pocket.

Wife: How can you say he stole it? Maybe I took it.

Husband: No, it must not have been you who took it, because there was still money left in the pocket.

Wife: (To the husband reading the newspaper): "Hey! Show me today's weather report. If it's good, I'll go out shopping."

Husband: (Opens the newspaper): "Oh dear! It won't work. The weather report says: There will be strong winds in the southwest, and there may be thunderstorms. By evening, there may be a big storm?"

### From the Folding Fans of Summer and Autumn to the Paintings of "Oolong Courtyard"

— Féisheng

The creation of the play "Oolong Courtyard" is completely based on the Water Margin novel written by Shi Nai'an, so whether it really happened or not is a matter that we can ignore. However, people who study Peking opera often like to scrutinize it, for example, whether "Liu Tang Sends a Letter" is placed before "Disturbing the Courtyard" or before "Assassinating the Daughter-in-Law." Of course, the latter is more secure and smooth, and this must be credited to Mr. Qi's courage to improve. However, in the "Disturbing the Courtyard" scene, Song Jiang has lines such as "...In the past, when Grandpa Song entered the courtyard, the floor was swept and the paintings were hung. Why haven't the floors been swept today, and the paintings haven't been hung...", and many people think that sweeping the floor must be done every day, but how could paintings be changed and hung every day? Those who think this is a flaw. I also wrote about this in the newspaper before. This is inevitably an unintentional remark. If you think about it carefully, changing the hanging of paintings every day, as early as hundreds of years ago, in the Song Dynasty, which was the most prosperous era of culture, was not impossible for people who loved calligraphy and painting. Although this seems impossible to verify, if we see that our previous generation of people who loved calligraphy and painting often used different fans in summer and autumn every day. The most particular ones, it is said, had various kinds of precious feather fans in addition to calligraphy and painting fans. By analogy, in the Qing Dynasty, it was still particular about changing the novelty of the fans every day, so in the Song Dynasty, which was the most prosperous era of culture, it was also possible for people who loved calligraphy and painting to pay attention to changing calligraphy and paintings every day? Drama is an expression of the times. I say the same about the play "Oolong Courtyard" because it points out that Song Jiang himself is a literati who thinks he loves calligraphy and painting!

Later, because they adhered to the old ways, were complacent and refused to make progress, and because other entertainment circles competed and progressed quickly, Suzhou Opera went downhill. Those who were more active implemented reforms and mostly joined the arms of civilized drama. Wang Meiyu and others are examples of this. The biggest reason for its failure is that the actors' spirit and physical strength are far inferior to others. Suzhou women are strong and willing to endure hardship. People who have been to the Suzhou countryside must have seen that women are the ones who carry sedan chairs there, and women are also the ones who farm. Most men go to teahouses and listen to storytelling and Suzhou ballad singing. More than half of the male actors and stagehands in Suzhou Opera are pitifully thin. To be honest, not a few of them have bad habits. The body is the biggest capital for all kinds of careers. If this capital is not enough, the career will not succeed. Therefore, in the Suzhou Opera venues in various amusement parks, they always play the erhu for nearly half an hour at the beginning. The person playing the erhu has a cigarette holder in his mouth with a paper cigarette without a bite. His eyes seem to need a spring to pop them open. He is listless and sends away the audience who were already somewhat decent, one by one. When Ma Langdang takes the stage, he sees that there are not many customers, and the singing and acting are even more boring. A man and a woman say a lot of nonsense. They drive away part of the few people who love to listen to Suzhou Opera. When there are only about ten minutes left until the time stipulated by the regulations, they come to a short song, and then sing "...The two enter the embroidered room together...", announcing the end of Suzhou Opera. If you think about this kind of singing, who else will come to support the show and welcome it? No wonder it's declining day by day. Entertainment circles rely solely on a small amount of salary in peacetime, they can only drink tap water. What they hope for are celebratory performances. Once the impression of Suzhou Opera on the audience is bad, it is difficult to get more performances. Zhu Guoliang's learning to sing the opening - there was a time when he was the assistant to the Suzhou ballad singer - is mostly ironclad evidence of the decline of Suzhou Opera. Suzhou Opera has the value of independent existence, as long as it can reform the above-mentioned shortcomings!

### Song Emperor and Empress Election Chronicle

— Sheng Tong

Music's influence on human emotion is truly great, and the impact of singing on people's will is also quite considerable. Often, we can be inspired by a generous and encouraging song to strive for our ambitions; or be moved by gentle and lingering melodies to feel profound emotions. The United States is still a country of peace and prosperity, so the production of Hollywood musical films is very developed, marketing to the Far East, and is particularly welcomed by the general audience in Shanghai. "Silver Song Selection" aims to introduce the latest popular songs from Hollywood. Since its publication, it has been well received by the general public. Now, in order to increase interest from all walks of life, the company specially held the "Hollywood Song Emperor and Empress Election" in mid-July at the New New Glass Radio Station, with open voting from the outside world. As of the end of July, more than 3,000 votes have been received. As a result, Deanna Durbin was elected as the Song Empress and Nelson Eddy was elected as the Song Emperor. (See picture)

### News from the Old Capital about Chrysanthemums

— Wan Nian

Recently, a friend sent a letter from the old capital, describing several interesting anecdotes about the opera scene, which are quite interesting. I have recorded them to share with the readers of this publication.

Wang Yaoqing Injured: Wang's senior disciple, Cheng Yuqing, has always been fond of drinking, and often gets into fights with people when drunk. On one occasion, the father, due to excessive drinking, muttered and scolded people, which led to an argument with his teacher. Cheng, in a drunken state, actually scratched the arm of the old performer. Yaoqing was very angry and it is said that it has triggered his old illness. He has also suffered a major mental shock. Many people have been visiting him in recent days to express their condolences.

Xun Huisheng Sells House: Xun's Liuxiang Restaurant, which he operated, has suffered huge losses (it is said to have lost 70,000 yuan). He now plans to sell all of his real estate, including his residence on Chunshu Third Street.

Grand Performance at the Chen Residence: On June 13th of the lunar calendar, there was a grand performance at the Chen residence in the British Concession of Tianjin. The program included Chen Jinbiao's (a student from the opera school) "The Peach Banquet," Yang Baosen and Xin Yanqiu's "Visiting Mother and Returning the Order," Shang Heyu's "Fighting Chuzhou," Jiang Miaoxiang and Xiao Changhua's "Promoted Three Ranks in a Row," Li Shaochun's "The Leopard with Golden Coins," and Ma Lianliang, Zhang Junqiu, Jiang Miaoxiang, Xiao Changhua, Yuan Shihai, etc.'s "The Dragon and Phoenix Bring Prosperity." The finale was Jin Shaoshan's "Herding Tigers at the Pass." The final act was Meng Xiaodong's "The Empty City Stratagem," with Bao Jixiang playing Wang Ping, Su Lianhan playing Ma Su, and Guo Yuanfen playing Sima Yi. Opera fans in Shanghai will inevitably be eager for this wonderful show.

### Blood Rain and Beautiful Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan's Small Characters are Delicate and Beautiful

While reciting the poems and couplets inscribed on the walls by various famous scholars, he praised them endlessly, and the crowd echoed him, trying to please him. After a while, a little maid held a red lantern, and the stepmother and servants came up, set up the banquet. Tian Hongyu, being honest and courteous, sat in the center, with the playboys sitting alongside. Yuan Yuan sat next to Tian Hongyu. After pouring the wine, Tian Hongyu raised his glass, stroked his silver beard, and happily drank. Soon the musician came up, tuned the strings, and Yuan Yuan sang a few ditties, like pearls rolling in jade, swallows chirping and orioles singing, so pleasant to hear. Tian Hongyu clapped and sighed in admiration. Seeing him so happy, the crowd flattered him with even nicer words. Yuan Yuan watched the playboys with a cold eye. Coincidentally, the playboy was also looking at her, and his treacherous gaze made Yuan Yuan shudder. She knew that the playboy was largely responsible for Tian Hongyu's visit, probably because he knew about her relationship with the Jade Poet and was jealous, deliberately leading this powerful Imperial Father-in-law to break up their marriage. So how should she deal with it? Yuan Yuan pondered this secretly. Suddenly, Tian Hongyu looked at her with a smile and said, "Why is the beauty thinking so deeply! The singing you just sang is still lingering in my old ears." Yuan Yuan had no choice but to raise her head and say, "The music of the common people is vulgar and unbearable to the ear. Your Excellency's praise makes this little girl ashamed." Tian Hongyu shook his head and said, "This song should only be heard in heaven, how can one hear it a few times in the human world? It is really your singing voice that is wonderful, not just my empty praise." The playboy said from the side, "Since the Imperial Father-in-law likes to listen, Yuan Yuan can sing a few more songs, so that we can all enjoy more music." The crowd applauded again, so Yuan Yuan had to sing again. Yuan Yuan sang clearly again and again, and Tian Hongyu, while applauding, just looked at her, his mouth open and unable to close. As a result, he drank more wine and gradually became drunk. According to his intention, he wanted to stay overnight in Yuan Yuan's boudoir, but because the sound of rain outside the window kept dripping, he was unhappy to return to the city (one line missing).

### Miscellaneous Theatre Arts Notes

— Fen Yu

Martial arts actor Liang Huichao left Gengxin troupe yesterday and will return to Beiping in the next few days. The troupe has found a suitable replacement.

Huangjintai's contract with Ji Yuliang expires on September 7th. It is said that martial arts master Gai Sitian will take over the troupe for 20 days. Gai is recovering from an illness, and the audience is very concerned about him and will naturally want to see him as soon as possible.

It is rumored that civil and military veteran actor Liu Hanchen will leave the Gongwu stage. It is likely that Gao Baisui will be invited back to replace him.

The famous actress Shan Wang Lanfang, originally one of the main actors of the Yifeng troupe, yesterday accepted Ms. Zhu Lanying as her apprentice. The apprenticeship ceremony was held at Huibinlou at noon, and many reporters and actors attended. Wang's favorite female disciples, Ms. Yu Sulian and Cao Xueqin, were also present.

### Small Biographies of Opera Figures

— Zheng Guo Yi wrote the biography, Zhang Yizhang created the drawings

(30) Yang Baosen

Yang Baosen is the grandson of Gui Yun (Duo Xian) and the nephew of Xiao Duo (Baoshen's father). Gui Yun's flower role was well-known in the late Qing Dynasty. His flamboyant plays were considered unique at the time. Xiao Duo inherited his father's legacy and also enjoyed a good reputation for playing flower roles. However, Baosen became famous for playing old male roles. Baosen studied under Qiu Guixian in his youth. Qiu Guixian was considered the authentic flower role performer, and he had been playing the qin for Tan Xinpei for a long time, so he deeply studied the Tan style. Therefore, although Baosen today relies on the Yu style, his achievements sometimes break into the depths of Tan's style. At the age of thirteen, he performed in the Binqing Society (it is a mistake to say that Baosen was a student trained by Binqing). His demeanor was dignified and mature, and those who knew him expected great things from him. At the age of sixteen, he performed twice on the Gengxin stage. Li Jirui happened to be in the same troupe. Li Jirui's skills were not worth mentioning, but the common people liked him. Before this, for more than ten years, he had not been considered a main act performer. However, this time, it was decided that Baosen would perform "Visiting Mother," and Ji Rui willingly retreated to the finale. Baosen's young age made this an unusual achievement. Not long after, his voice broke and he did not perform on stage for several years. At home, he deliberately imitated Shu Yan, focusing on every tune and word, striving to imitate him exactly. His dedication to Shu Yan was like the seventy disciples' devotion to Confucius, and he maintained it to the end. Today, among the emerging old male role actors in the opera world, those who are said to be the most disciplined are, among the female actors, only Meng Xiaodong, and among the male actors, Baosen is considered the best, which is generally agreed upon without dissent. Baosen has performed in Shanghai several times and has a very good reputation. He is now leading a troupe in the old capital, and is increasingly competing with Ma Lianliang and Tan Fuying, alternating in carrying the troupe. In this time of fluctuating opera customs and scattered laws, it is gratifying to see such a righteous talent rising up, asserting himself, and forming his own team, and dealing with him among them.
