### U.S. Secretary of State Hull's Statement: No Change in Policy Towards Japan; Will Assist China's War Effort with More Supplies; Matsuoka Claims Japan Will Continue to Adhere to the Axis

WASHINGTON - Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday that there has been no change in U.S. policy towards Japan. Hull's statement came during a press conference in response to questions about President Roosevelt's avoidance of mentioning Japan in his speech on Tuesday, as the President believes that Japanese businessmen will eventually rise up against Japan's military leadership. (United Press, 30th)

WASHINGTON - President Roosevelt's speech on Tuesday repeatedly mentioned and criticized Hitler, but hardly mentioned Japan, leading to rumors here that the President was trying to appease Japan in an attempt to persuade it to leave the Axis. Unattributed remarks from Congress, circulated everywhere, further suggested the truth of these rumors. Therefore, when Secretary of State Hull met with journalists yesterday afternoon, many inquired about this. However, Hull only responded that there was no change in U.S. policy towards Japan. However, it is not difficult to explain the aforementioned rumors. It appears that the rumors originated in Oregon, which is known for being sympathetic to Japan, just as California is known for being anti-Japanese. Japan is Oregon's best customer, which explains the origin of the rumors. Examining Hull's statement that the U.S. has not changed its policy towards Japan, the U.S. still views Japan as part of the entire Axis, and therefore considers Japan's policies, like those of Germany and Italy, to be based on hostility towards the U.S. Washington is currently filled with rumors about the possibility of peace talks between Chongqing and Tokyo, but responsible parties have not only not confirmed this, but also indicated that they will provide more assistance to China to aid its war effort against a part of the Axis. However, the arrival of this assistance in China will be slightly slower than its arrival in Britain. China is currently tying down Japan, preventing its army from being used elsewhere, and the Japanese army seems incapable of penetrating deep into China or forcing China to submit. In Europe, Britain urgently needs assistance to contain the Axis in Europe, which is why U.S. supplies are being prioritized for Britain. Once assistance to Britain increases slightly, U.S. supplies to China via the Pacific will greatly increase, unlike the current slow pace. (Reuters, 30th)

WASHINGTON - Officials at the Export Control Board confirmed that the government is not currently considering changing any existing regulations regarding the control of the export of key defense materials to Japan, including gasoline. President Roosevelt stated at a press conference on Wednesday that the U.S. will not consider any further control of kerosene exports to Japan, other than the export control procedures currently in place. Before President Roosevelt made this statement, reliable sources claimed that the President deliberately did not mention Japan in his fireside chat because he did not want to offend those who could actually change Japan's national policy, such as Japanese businessmen. This is the first clear indication of the administration's hope that Japan will distance itself from the Axis. (United Press, 30th)

TOKYO - Japanese officials declared that Matsuoka reiterated today that the Tripartite Pact is the unchangeable foundation of Japan's foreign policy and that Japan will abide by the Tripartite Pact. Matsuoka made these remarks to counter the U.S. attempt to separate Japan from the Axis. Matsuoka said that this information was based on misleading news and was intentionally spread. When Matsuoka strongly stated that Japan would continue to adhere to the Axis, he said, "Based on the statements made by Prime Minister Konoe and myself in the past, and the subsequent evolution of Japanese policy, everyone should understand this." Matsuoka also said that Japan's southward advance policy is a peaceful process, but if international developments make this policy impossible, Japan may have to reconsider its attitude according to changing circumstances. (United Press, 30th)

### German Ambassador Ott Visits Japanese Foreign Minister

TOKYO - German Ambassador to Japan Ott visited Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka to discuss President Roosevelt's speech, which proves that Germany is deeply concerned that the speech may affect Japanese public opinion. A government spokesperson told foreign reporters today that the German ambassador's visit to the Foreign Minister was for this purpose. (Reuters, 30th)

### British, American, and Canadian Teams Jointly Organize Relief Team to China

NEW YORK - The American Friends Service Committee announced yesterday that it has sent a rescue team composed of British, American, and Canadian members to China to provide relief to civilians wounded by Japanese bombing along the Yunnan-Burma Road. The team consists of 50 members, 10 ambulances, and mobile operating rooms with sterilization equipment, generators, and X-ray equipment. The team leader is Canadian surgeon Dr. McLaurin, who has served as a doctor at a church in Central China for 10 years and is a member of the International Red Cross. The British team members have already departed for Rangoon, while the American and Canadian team members will depart for China within a week. (United Press, 30th)

### Japanese Cabinet Discusses World Situation; Attacks Dutch East Indies Government

TOKYO - Japanese spokespersons and newspapers yesterday attacked the Dutch East Indies government, saying it "completely relies on Britain and the United States." At the same time, Prime Minister Konoe is meeting with Japanese government advisors and key cabinet members at his private residence. The main topic is the world situation related to President Roosevelt's speech. After the meeting, Japanese government officials and advisors, as well as naval and army leaders, consulted for a long time. Newspapers here are generally moderate in tone, but the "Hochi Shimbun" criticized Roosevelt's mention of China, saying, "The U.S. has now openly declared its hostility towards Japan and has forced Japan to remove this hostility." (International News Service, 30th)

### U.S. Representative of the Stabilization Fund, Fox, Arrives in Honolulu; Reportedly Seeks Closer Cooperation Between China, Britain, and the U.S.; Johnson Submits Favorable Report on China's War Effort

HONOLULU - Fox, the U.S. representative of the Chinese Stabilization Fund Committee, arrived here yesterday en route to Chongqing aboard a clipper. It is said that while the initial purpose of the Stabilization Fund Committee was to stabilize the Chinese currency, its realistic goal is to seek further close cooperation between China, Britain, and the U.S. He stated that the committee hopes to assist China in developing its foreign trade with material resources and should be an important factor in China's reconstruction process. (United Press, 30th)

WASHINGTON - Secretary of State Hull stated here yesterday that former U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson has submitted a favorable report to the State Department regarding China's war effort. When asked what Johnson's report covered, Hull replied that he believed "newspapers would not obtain any unfavorable news from Johnson." Johnson's vacancy will be filled by Ambassador Gauss, and Johnson himself will soon succeed Gauss as the U.S. Minister to Australia. (United Press, 30th)

### U.S. Tests World's Largest Bomber in Southern California

LOS ANGELES - Yesterday, troops in key areas of Southern California, accompanied by anti-aircraft artillery, traveled in multiple trucks to city airports, Lockheed Air Terminal, Burbank, Clover Field, Santa Monica. It is assumed the U.S. Army wants to heavily guard the above key areas when testing the world's largest bomber. After anti-aircraft artillery units were dispatched to major aircraft factories, army detachments immediately entered. Naval and marine patrols are stationed at the Port of Los Angeles. The bomber test will be held at the Douglas Aircraft Factory. Clover Field is adjacent to the factory, and security has been increased along the old Terminal Island wharf to "prevent interference."

Editorial

### How to Help the Impoverished Masses

Since the prices of all goods have soared, general living conditions have been severely impacted. Regardless of whether it is [the impact] or not, social welfare and charitable endeavors, such as caring for orphans and the elderly, aiding the disabled, providing medical care and medicine, cooking porridge for disaster relief, and covering burials, are all facing the risk of insufficient funding and a lack of provisions. The original funds were only sufficient for regular expenses. Now that everything is extraordinary, where can this extraordinary funding come from to provide support? Thus, to compensate for what has been exhausted, assistance is repeatedly called for, relying on the help of enthusiastic members of society. This is, of course, the inevitable outcome. However, as the pressure of life deepens, the masses waiting for relief increase. Just as illness cannot be avoided, the cost of medicine is beyond the means of the average person, leading crowds to flock to places providing medical care and medicine. Hunger cannot be endured, with rice costing thousands of cash units per measure, prompting people to travel ten or twenty miles early in the morning to beg for food from porridge distribution sites in the north and south. Devastated by war, there are orphans, widows, the elderly without support, and the young without guardians, wandering and displaced, falling into ditches and ravines, overwhelming the capacity to care for them. Moreover, the roads are filled with starving corpses, and burials are constantly taking place, filling the leaky grounds. This also involves public health, which cannot be interrupted even for a moment. Considering these points, which are not the pleas of the helpless masses, and which are not unbearable to human compassion? Those who willingly degenerate and wander the streets are, of course, pests of society, and it would not be an exaggeration to let them live or die on their own. However, those with a compassionate heart still feel a sense of pity and do not hesitate to provide assistance. For those whose misfortunes are not self-inflicted, whose circumstances are unavoidable, who are sinking in the same sea of suffering, where else can they turn? Can one remain unmoved? Can one refuse to provide assistance? If so, then society is cold-hearted and the masses are left uncared for, which is not what Shanghai society is about. Consider the New Universal Relief Home, which quickly raised 100,000 yuan for provisions. The work of the Tushanwan Orphanage, just disclosed in this newspaper, has already seen a continuous stream of donations. Similarly, the porridge kitchens of the Tongren Auxiliary Yuan Hall, the Charity Alliance, and the Jisheng Association, as well as other groups providing free meals, medicine, and burials, have all received enthusiastic support from various sectors of society. These reports never cease to arrive, showing that Shanghai people are not lacking in those who find "the greatest joy in doing good," and that this is a ray of hope in the midst of the financial exhaustion of various public welfare and charitable undertakings.

However, public welfare and charity are beautiful names. As a result, there are those who steal their names for beauty, and charity has actually become a "household" name, with charity as a profession. Those who call themselves such are shameless, and those who receive their assistance are unashamed. Both are truly lost. Relief is, in fact, an obligation that humanity should have. In Chinese ethical and moral concepts, starting from familial love and benevolence, extending to clans, relatives, society, and the nation, helping those in need and relieving poverty is seen as a matter of course. Everyone should have this in mind, but not everyone can fulfill this duty. Thus, those who have money but cannot provide labor fulfill their obligation by donating money; those who have labor but no money to donate fulfill their obligation by providing labor; and those who can donate both money and labor donate both. They are simply fulfilling what they should fulfill and doing what they should do. Therefore, to boast and congratulate oneself for handling charitable work, claiming it as one's own achievement, is no different from claiming the merits of heaven. What could be more ominous? If one handles charitable work to create a reputation and gain a position, then how is that different from treating it as a gateway to success, a shortcut to advancement? Is that the original intention of the undertaking? As for those who have other intentions and use the name of charity as a guise, they are even lower and not worth mentioning. This is not that we are deliberately being harsh. It is simply that people's hearts differ as much as their faces, and it is not difficult to find good and bad mixed together. One must know that handling public welfare and charitable work, entrusted by the public to achieve relief, is not just like rescuing someone from a fire or drowning, allowing no delay. It requires thinking about every penny and every item, regardless of whether it comes from public or private sources, as the crystallization of effort and dedication. How should one understand this intention, considering the difficulty of obtaining resources and the ease with which they can be misused, in order to ensure that funds are not wasted and that relief is delivered effectively? This is the duty of those involved in disaster relief. It is not just that people hope to be rescued through charitable acts. If the handling is not careful and the name does not match the reality, then those who were originally intended to be rescued may instead be severely harmed, and those who were originally intended to be saved may instead be killed. Therefore, if the work is not handled by the right people, it will not only be a waste of resources and a source of abuse, but also a mess, often achieving the opposite effect. For urgent disaster relief efforts, such as those caused by floods, fires, or war, which arise suddenly and require temporary measures, only those with ample disaster relief experience can handle them. If one intends to engage in public welfare and charitable work, one must only know the public good and not consider personal gain, dedicating oneself wholeheartedly. Even employed personnel, who are partly volunteering, must have a deep interest in disaster relief, and not just see it as a place to earn a living. If one always thinks of relief funds and goods as coming from those who need to be rescued, then one should strive for fairness in distribution, thoroughness in preservation, and practicality in operations, never betraying the intentions of those who provide the relief. This is also the responsibility of those involved in disaster relief. Therefore, the key to disaster relief lies in finding the right people, and what is meant by finding the right people is simply finding those who can be sincere and dedicated! If everyone harbors a sense of caution, as if treading on thin ice over a deep abyss, thinking that any mistake will bring guilt upon oneself, then one will certainly not dare to embezzle even a penny, seek out the right people for the job, and not dare to act rashly. Those who receive relief will all benefit, and the good deed will be accomplished.

However, while disaster relief should be handled in this way, it must rely on the assistance of members of society in order to proceed without fear of being abandoned halfway, and to handle matters with dedication and focus. One should not think that this is only the responsibility of charitable organizations and stand by idly. Nor should one worry that the money and goods donated will be embezzled by those handling them and withhold one's support. One must know that, from the standpoint of donating, one should be concerned about the suffering of the masses and not question the character of a few individuals. One should only ask whether the relief is what one urgently needs and whether the donation is one's due responsibility! If it is one's responsibility, then one should not have the idea that one is giving to others, nor should one think that others are receiving from oneself. One should not even think about how the donated items will be handled, but simply do what one's heart feels at ease with and what one can do. If there is anything that is not done thoroughly or honestly, that is the fault of those handling the relief. However, those handling the relief may not all be famous, and those who are famous may not all be genuine. Therefore, in order to make donations more effective and impactful, one should understand the performance of the work one intends to donate to before donating. If it is good, then one should offer assistance without being asked, allowing those who do good deeds wholeheartedly without seeking recognition to know that the truth is out there, and members of society will have a fair judgment, knowing what to encourage and becoming more motivated. Today, various undertakings are hindered by rising prices, suffering from financial difficulties, and the number of those waiting for relief is even greater than in the past. It is truly a time for all sectors to work together to maintain [these undertakings]. However, one should not be ashamed of donating small amounts, thinking that they are insignificant, and therefore not donate. One must know that a pagoda is built by gathering sand, and it all comes from tiny particles. As long as one does what one can to the best of one's ability. One should not be indifferent to relieving the poor and impoverished because one is wealthy and well-off, thinking that it has nothing to do with oneself. One must know that the world is impermanent, people's hearts are unpredictable, and no one can guarantee that they will not fall from grace. Why not plant good roots in times of prosperity to avoid being reproached for being rich and unkind? As the hot summer is approaching, medical undertakings are particularly important. Existing medical care and medicine provision programs, especially those with a proven track record, should be maintained by the power of the masses, or even expanded, to meet the urgent needs of the summer season. However, one must carefully select medicines, prioritizing human life and not using relief as a pretext, only seeking to have the appearance of it. People in Shanghai have always been known for their charitable nature, with a deep sympathy for helping the poor and relieving the impoverished. At this critical juncture, they will surely take the initiative to reduce their own desires and expenses in order to establish and maintain social undertakings. This will be more than enough. With the wind rising, one should not treat these words as empty talk.

### U.S. Strengthens Atlantic Fleet to Fulfill President's Promise to Aid Britain; Roosevelt Requests Continued Issuance of Additional Naval Funds; Soviets Believe Britain and the U.S. Will Intensify Cooperation in the Pacific

WASHINGTON - Reliable sources reported yesterday that the United States is engaging in extensive naval activity aimed at strengthening the material power of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet in order to fulfill President Roosevelt's pledge to supply raw materials to Britain. Observers also noted that the President mentioned in his fireside chat on Tuesday that the Atlantic Fleet is constantly being strengthened. However, the only source for new ships to reinforce the Atlantic is the Pacific Fleet. The new Atlantic coast is insufficient to accommodate the number of ships required by the "Special Service Fleet." The only American superbattleship currently in the Atlantic suitable for modern warfare is the 35,000-ton "North Carolina," a sister ship to the "Washington," which is currently undergoing sea trials. The "Washington" was recently assigned to service and is currently in the waters off Hawaii, but it cannot sail out until the dredging of the strait off Hawaii is half-completed. It is also known that the "Washington's" sea trial date is scheduled for July. The other three superbattleships in the Atlantic include the newly built aircraft carrier "Wasp" and the "Yorktown." (United Press, 30th)

WASHINGTON - President Roosevelt yesterday requested Congress to allocate an additional $114,091,080 in naval funds for the current year, including $50 million for the construction of additional air stations and naval equipment, and $150,000 for the construction of an ammunition depot on Oahu Island, Hawaii. (United Press, 30th)

MOSCOW - The Red Army's newspaper, "Red Star," recently commented on President Roosevelt's speech, saying that Britain and the U.S. should intensify military cooperation in the Pacific. This can be clearly seen from the U.S. expansion of its naval patrol area, allowing American ships to travel to the Suez Canal via the Pacific and Indian Oceans. (Havas, 29th)

### U.S. Senate Passes Foreign Vessel Act; Sent to White House for Signature

(Reuters, 30th)

WASHINGTON - The Senate passed a bill authorizing the President to requisition foreign vessels, including the "Normandie," which is docked in U.S. ports. (United Press, 30th)

### U.S. Building Large Number of Ships

WASHINGTON - Senior officials said that the United States is currently building or has ordered a total of 851 ships, of which only 60 are specifically being built for Britain. However, there are also 422 ships that, although ordered under an emergency program, will be used by Britain as much as possible after completion. Of the ships currently under construction, 603 are cargo ships, 30 are passenger ships, 165 are oil tankers, and there are 53 other miscellaneous ships that have not been announced.

### Responding to Roosevelt's Speech, Foreign Secretary Eden Clarifies Britain's War Aims: Reforming Europe Based on Four Freedoms; Germany Will Not Be Allowed to Perpetrate Atrocities Again After the War

London - Official declaration of Britain's war aims was first made yesterday in a speech by Foreign Secretary Eden. The war aims clarified by Eden include the four freedoms declared in President Roosevelt's speech, with an added condition: that after the war, strict military and political measures must be adopted to prevent Germany from rising again to contend for global dominance. Eden stated, "Regarding the issue of European revival, its solution will necessarily be influenced by the situation elsewhere, such as in the Far East. After the current arduous struggles of China and Japan conclude, various extremely significant problems will inevitably arise, which can only be resolved with the collective assistance of all other nations." Eden continued, "I do not believe Britain will impose harsh and severe conditions. According to the economic cooperation plan, Germany should be a contributor to economic recovery. However, we must never forget that Germany is the most evil perpetrator in Europe. In the past century, it has disrupted peace five times, and we must not allow it to have the capacity to disrupt peace again. Britain's strength lies in seeking freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom from fear, freedom from want (Roosevelt's four freedoms). Britain plans to establish social security, both domestically and abroad. It will stabilize currency, provide for the hungry, prevent unemployment, and prevent price fluctuations. It will cooperate with the United States, overseas dominions, and South America in education. Britain's peace plan will interfere with a nation's internal economy to the least extent possible. But if asked what contribution Germany can make to the world economy, the answer is absolutely none." (United Press dispatch, 30th)

London - British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech yesterday at the Lord Mayor's office in London to hundreds of listeners regarding Britain's plan for post-war economic and social reconstruction has instilled new hope in the war-weary people of Europe. This speech is a response to the "New Economic Order of Europe" chanted by the Nazis. Eden explained (1) Germany's plan to reform Europe would only enslave others spiritually and economically. (2) Only Britain and the United States can provide Europe with the food and raw materials it desperately needs. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

London - British Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech in London yesterday that President Roosevelt has indicated the path for free nations of the world and accomplished great works of faith and statesmanship. The essence of the President's speech lies in declaring that the existence of free nations ultimately depends on the freedom of the seas. This meaning also applies to the British Empire and has equal force. The President's broadcast is a world event. The President has expressed with his words the firm resolve of the strongest nation on earth. Eden mentioned Iraq, saying that since the Regent of Iraq returned to the country a few days ago, he has received countless expressions of loyalty and support from all parts of the country, and many former friends of Ali Gailani have fled. Therefore, this self-proclaimed dictator will soon be unable to gain a foothold in Iraq. Britain has absolutely no intention of undermining Iraq's independence. The British government also has great sympathy for Syria's desire for independence. Many Arab thinkers want to seek greater unity for the Arab people and expect Britain's assistance in this regard. Britain will definitely respond to such appeals from British friends.

Eden went on to speak about the future of Europe and its spiritual and material reconstruction, saying, "Do not say that we want to restore the chaos of the world." When peace is restored in the future, we should relax wartime financial measures to ensure that international trade can restore its prosperity on the broadest possible basis. We should hope to see the development of an international exchange system, so that the exchange of goods and businesses in this system can obtain capital cooperation. Throughout this transitional period, social security must be the primary objective of our domestic and foreign policies after the war. We are willing to cooperate with others to prevent hunger, monetary disorder, and major fluctuations in the labor market and prices after the armistice. Germany must participate in this matter, but what we must never forget is that Germany is the worst master Europe has ever had. We will ensure that political and military peace terms can prevent the recurrence of German atrocities in the future.

No one can predict when the end of the war will come, but this end will eventually come suddenly, like the operation of a machine, just as the Germans broke the peace without warning. However, when discussing the reconstruction of Europe, we do not ignore the fact that a solution can affect developments elsewhere and be affected by developments elsewhere. Such developments include, for example, the Far East. Eden then stated, "The permanent resolution of the entire continent and internal peace is our sole objective." (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Two Democratic Nations Share the Same Goal

Washington - Britain has been slow to announce its war aims. It is widely said here that Britain regards winning the war as its top priority, so it has no time for this. Others say that Britain's failure to announce its aims has other intentions. Now, Foreign Secretary Eden has announced Britain's war aims. In the eyes of Americans, the wording and timing are unparalleled. Although what has been received here is understood to be a brief outline of Eden's speech, it has aroused great interest in all sectors and generated the feeling that the two major democratic nations are advancing towards the same goal. Undoubtedly, Eden's words will be welcomed by the American press. There is no official criticism from official circles at present, but it is not difficult to infer that the White House and the State Department are sure to be delighted by these remarks. Eden is a person who would rather sacrifice his position than blindly appease. This place greatly admires him and once wished him to be the ambassador to the United States. Therefore, the fact that this person made this statement is certainly appealing. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### Heated Debate Before British Parliament Adjourns

London - While British Foreign Secretary Eden was speaking in London yesterday, the House of Commons, on the occasion of proposing the Whitsun recess, debated the issue of announcing Britain's post-war aims. The main speaker was Liberal MP Mandell Halifax, who has a broad "post-war reconstruction" plan, advocating the use of the British Commonwealth as a conduit for greater world unity, and said that we should make the German people understand that we do not want to enslave the Germans, just as the Germans want to enslave us. However, we do not want to make peace with Hitler, because holding meetings with untrustworthy villains is of no use. Many people expressed similar sentiments during the debate. Government spokesman Butler briefly summarized Foreign Secretary Eden's remarks to conclude this debate, and said that it would be a great mistake to give the impression that Britain is not fighting for the greatest security at home and throughout the world, nor for the freedom fought for in Europe. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### No Peace Possible Between Britain and Germany

Washington - British Ambassador to the United States Halifax told the press last night that no matter the scope and amount of American aid, Britain will continue to fight, because there can be no peace with a mad dog. Halifax's remarks were made in response to rumors that Britain was prepared to make peace if the United States did not quickly join the war. (United Press dispatch, 30th)

### Since the Outbreak of the War in Europe, British Naval Losses Account for One-Third of the Total - A Detailed Account Published by a Roman Newspaper -

Rome - Major Tuccino, naval correspondent for the "Roman People's News," recently listed the number of British warships lost, as acknowledged by the British Admiralty, as follows:

Battleships: Royal Oak (29,500 tons), Haught (42,100 tons)

Aircraft Carriers: Glorious (22,500 tons), Courageous (22,500 tons) Cruisers: Cavernzo (4,180 tons), Effingham (9,770 tons), Southampton (9,100 tons), Gloucester (9,300 tons), Panavenche (5,450 tons), Fitzy (8,000 tons)

Submarines: A total of twenty-five vessels, totaling 26,674 tons.

According to Major Tuccino, Britain acknowledged a total loss of 260,000 tons, but the actual loss is at least 500,000 tons. Therefore, British naval losses are not only greater than those lost in the World War, but also reach one-third of its entire navy. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 30th)

### Over a Hundred Officers and Soldiers Rescued from the German Battleship Bismarck Become Prisoners of War; Only Three Survivors from the Haught

London - The Admiralty announced that 150 officers and men rescued from the German battleship "Bismarck" by British warships have become prisoners of war. Other German soldiers were not rescued because of the harassment of German submarines in the vicinity. Only two people were rescued when the British battleship Haught sank, because the ship's ammunition depot exploded extremely rapidly. Water surrounded and killed 1,341 officers and men on board, and there was no time to rescue them. Also, the British destroyer "Marshna" (1,850 tons) was sunk by aircraft while pursuing the "Bismarck." One officer and forty-five sailors are missing. The "Marshna" normally carries 190 officers and men and was built in March 1937. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Report: 23rd to 29th

Chongqing – The Military Affairs Commission released its weekly war report, covering the period from the 23rd to the 29th. A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that during the week, Japanese forces showed signs of activity in various locations, and Chinese forces also launched counterattacks. While it is unclear which event is more significant, both the Chinese people and international observers are closely following the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain. This report will provide a comprehensive overview of the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, allowing readers to gain a complete understanding of the situation. Additional details on other battles will be provided later. The Japanese objective (the 14th Zhongtiao Mountain Sweep Operation): Most of the transportation hubs and lines in Shanxi Province are occupied by the Japanese. However, the major mountainous areas on all sides remain in the hands of Chinese forces. The Zhongtiao Mountain region can be used to threaten the southern section of the Tongpu Railway if advancing, and can rely on the river for self-defense if retreating. The Japanese believe that they cannot tolerate such a threat, so they launched what they call the "Zhongtiao Mountain Sweep Operation." One attempt failed, followed by a second, and then a third. Over the past three years, there have been as many as thirteen attempts, but each time they not only failed to achieve their objectives, but also suffered losses and abandoned equipment before retreating. This has led to frustration and anger. Furthermore, as they are trying to resolve the "China Incident," they are determined to launch the so-called "14th Zhongtiao Mountain Sweep Operation" on a large scale, mobilizing forces from all directions. The situation is as follows: (1)

Pre-war Deployment

The Japanese army began secret preparations for this large-scale invasion of Zhongtiao Mountain in April. At the beginning of April, the Harada Division, stationed in Kaifeng, was transferred to the vicinity of Qinbo. The cavalry brigade from Shangqiu and the Tanaka Division from Xuzhou were also transferred from the Longhai Railway to this area. The Sakurai Division from northern Jiangxi was also transferred from the Longhai Railway to the vicinity of Yangcheng and Qinshui, forming the eastern route army. The Shimizu Division in the Linfen area and the Ikegami Independent Brigade in Taiyuan, as well as the Katayama Independent Mixed Brigade in eastern Jin, were stationed on the Hengling Pass of Jiangxian County, forming the northern route army. The Japanese divisions such as the a certain Independent Mixed Brigade in northern Jin and the Iseki and Ando Divisions in the southeastern Jin and the triangle area of southern Jin were gathered in the areas of Zhangmao Avenue and Xiaxian County, forming the western route army. (2)

Course of the Battle

The various routes began to move on May 7th, using all their strength to attack the Chinese field army. (A) The eastern route advanced westward through Wenxian County and Qinyang County, passing through Mengxian County and Jiyuan County to attack Fengmenkou. (B) The northern route advanced southward from Jiangxian County and Hengling Pass towards Yuanqu. (C) The western route advanced eastward from Xiaxian County and Zhangmao Avenue to attack Wangjiahe, Taichai Village. The northeastern route invaded Dongfeng through Yangcheng, Qinshui and Zhangma of Yicheng. The Chinese army was well prepared and immediately engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese. After strong resistance from the Chinese, both sides suffered heavy casualties, and the Japanese forces failed to achieve their goals. The Japanese then used a large amount of poison gas and relied on the assistance of their superior air force to successively invade areas such as Yuanqu, Fengmenkou, Shaoyuan Town, and Taichai Village. The Chinese troops resisting the northeastern route of the Japanese army have always stood firm on the line from Dongfeng to Baihuacun. After Yuanqu was captured by the Japanese, the Chinese troops on Zhongtiao Mountain were divided into two parts. The troops west of Jiangyuan Avenue are still confronting the Japanese, while the troops east of the Fanse River and in the mountainous area are still firmly entrenched in the mountainous area northeast of Tongxin Town. The Japanese forces in Yuanqu then invaded Shaoyuan Town to the east and joined with the Japanese forces invading Fengmenkou and Wangwu to the west, opening up the Ji-Yuan Avenue and completing the encirclement. They then advanced towards the various troops north of Jiangyuan Avenue. The Chinese forces saw through their intentions and separately moved out of the encirclement and launched a counter-encirclement. Therefore, there have been fierce battles for five days and nights in the northwestern areas of Qinshui and Gaoping recently. The battles around Yangcheng on the west side of Ji-Yuan Avenue are also extremely fierce. A certain unit west of the Jiangxian-Yuan Avenue has also advanced to the area between Wenxi and Xinjiang and is fighting a desperate battle with the Japanese. At present, all routes are progressing as planned and expanding the results of the battle. (3)

Refuting Japanese Claims

In this battle, Japanese Lieutenant Colonel Ueda, the commander of the Japanese regiment, was killed near Taichai Village. At the same time, Chinese Division Commander Wang Jun also died heroically. The death of generals in major wars is not uncommon. However, the Japanese used their usual trick of spreading rumors and made extensive propaganda to the international community, falsely accusing China of suffering heavy losses and losing many generals. These rumors are not worth a smile from those who know the truth, so I have already refuted them earlier. (4)

Final Conclusion

The Japanese objective is to clear the Zhongtiao Mountain area, capture the Chinese field army and annihilate it. In fact, not only has the Chinese field army not been annihilated, but it has also advanced to various areas near Wenxi, Xinjiang, Fushan, and Yicheng. As for the results of the battle, the Japanese headquarters in southern Shanxi said in a telegram on the 22nd that China had abandoned 4,200 corpses and captured 2,000 prisoners. The Nanjing Japanese China Expeditionary Force reported that China had abandoned 35,000 corpses and captured 8,000 prisoners. An Allied telegram from a certain place in Shanxi on the 25th said that China had abandoned more than 1,000 corpses and another 565 people were captured. A telegram from Shanghai on the 27th, according to a Japanese military spokesman, claimed that China had 5,042 deaths, 12,946 prisoners, and an unknown number of injuries. The numbers vary greatly, and they are obviously inconsistent because they are based on fabricated rumors and not on facts. It is natural for there to be deaths and injuries in battle. Even if, as they say, the Chinese side suffered 30,000 casualties, it is estimated that the Japanese also suffered more than 30,000 casualties. Three train cars of scrap steel helmets were transported north on the Tongpu Railway, and more than 2,000 bodies were cremated in Yuncheng and Jiexian in one day. This one point is enough to show the whole picture. In this way, the Japanese desire to complete the "mopping-up plan" in the occupied areas and resolve the so-called "China Incident" is a dream.

Eastern Zhejiang Chinese Army

After capturing Zhuji City on the 20th, the Chinese army continued to pursue north along the railway, giving the Japanese no chance to breathe. Now the Chinese army has crossed Linpu and Bailutang and is pressing towards Xiaoshan City. At the same time, the important strongholds of Yuyao and Shangyu have also been captured by the Chinese army one after another. A Japanese military spokesman in Shanghai said on the 24th when receiving foreign reporters that this battle in Zhuji can be compared to a snake fighting a pheasant. The Chinese army adopted a crescent-shaped siege tactic, like a snake surrounding the pheasant's body, but the result was that the pheasant spread its wings and flew away. The hesitant and indecisive Japanese army has admitted defeat in eastern Zhejiang.

Southern Hubei

On the 21st, the Japanese army in Tongshan, Henglin Bridge, Ma Bridge, Bai Dun, Jin Niu and other places gathered more than 2,000 troops and advanced towards Shangxia Ni, Xie, Zhangjia Street, and Zhangjiapu. The Chinese army dealt them a heavy blow, and the Japanese failed to achieve their goals. The Japanese then increased their reinforcements to more than 3,000, and the Chinese army launched hammer tactics again, breaking through the Japanese everywhere. As of the 24th, the Chinese and Japanese armies were still fighting fiercely in the Damoshan area.

Eastern Guangdong

After suffering a major defeat by the Chinese army last week, the Japanese army had difficulty establishing a foothold in Huiyang and Boluo. Huiyang City was captured by the Chinese army on the morning of the 21st, and the Japanese were driven out of Boluo City on the evening of the 22nd. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. Now the Chinese army is continuing to pursue the Japanese, and Shilong and Danshui are both under heavy attack by the Chinese army.

Southern Fujian

The Japanese army trapped in Fuzhou, under pressure from the Chinese army, risked invading the mountains northwest of Fuzhou. On the 23rd and 24th, they engaged in bloody battles with the Chinese army. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties all over the mountains and valleys. After reinforcements arrived, they engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army between Baisha and Dahu. The Japanese army suffered even heavier casualties. Now the Chinese army has captured the highlands east of Dahu and is continuing to attack Dahu.

Other Areas

The Japanese army that invaded Leigongtang from Wangjiashan on the Ruiwu Road in northern Jiangxi has been repelled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army attacking in the Zhuxi area is still fighting the Japanese in the Kang Gu Ping Dongkou area. The Japanese army in northern Hunan, who invaded south of Zhongfang and Taolin, has been heavily attacked by the Chinese army and is currently fighting fiercely in the area north of Dayun Mountain.

### Roosevelt's Speech: Matsuoka Refuses to Comment, Japanese Newspapers Advocate for War Against the US, Saying the Navy is Ready

Tokyo – Tokyo Japanese newspapers today prominently published Foreign Minister Matsuoka's comments on President Roosevelt's speech, stating, "There is no need for comment." The Asahi Shimbun said that Matsuoka's response to reporters was "concise and meaningful." The Hochi Shimbun claimed that Matsuoka also said, "First, I did not see anything new in this fireside chat. Second, the tone was weaker than before." (30th United Press Telegram)

Tokyo – The Nichinichi Shimbun criticized the recent formal statement by the government on Japan's enhanced national defense, saying, "Japan has decided to fight any challenging nation and is fully prepared." This comment by the newspaper was in response to the declaration by Colonel Hiraide, head of the Naval Press Section. Hiraide said, "We are absolutely prepared" to deal with any situation. Hiraide's words were published by every Japanese newspaper in Tokyo and indicated with huge headlines that Japan has completed its national defense and has 500 warships and 4,000 aircraft. Hiraide said in a nationwide broadcast that if the United States goes to war with Germany, "the Pacific problem will immediately affect Japan" because of the Tripartite Pact. He also said that if the United States were to go to war with Germany, the former would adopt a "guerrilla" strategy to destroy Japan's "maritime trade and transportation." However, he said that this strategy would not be "seriously conducted, like the European war," and could not be compared to Germany's dealings with Britain. In addition to the responsibilities of the Tripartite Pact, Japan would be forced to engage in a war of self-defense to "overcome the economic pressure of the enemy country." However, "Japan does not necessarily have to force Germany to fight." Hiraide also said that Japan cannot explicitly state in this world situation whether it will participate in the war, but "we are fully prepared" when necessary. The Nichinichi Shimbun's editorial supported this speech, believing that Japan's true desire, although to establish peace in East Asia and the world, is not to disturb the situation in the Pacific, but it is still determined to fight any challenger. This is what the United States should know. The Nichinichi Shimbun said that it is now a matter of time before the United States joins the European war, and this will immediately affect Japan. Japan is bound by the Tripartite Pact and may participate in the war. It also said, "What is gratifying is that Japan now has a well-equipped navy, with the help of a powerful air force, and will never be defeated by any country. The authorities' statement regarding the Japanese navy being prepared to deal with any situation is a reassurance." (30th United Press Telegram)

Tokyo – Responsible sources here said that President Roosevelt's broadcast speech has given Japan a respite, but there is considerable concern about what will happen in the future. Before President Roosevelt's speech, the main issue that Japan was considering was whether the country would be forced to join the European war to contain the US threat to Germany. The Japanese government originally intended to keep this issue a secret to a considerable extent to maintain calm in the country. However, it did not know whether President Roosevelt would go to war with Germany or only decide to send warships to escort munitions to supply Britain, so that Japan would have to fulfill Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact and be drawn into the vortex of the European war to meet the demands of Germany and Italy. President Roosevelt's speech did not directly announce the implementation of escort, so the delicate issue that Japan should have resolved was temporarily shelved. As for Japanese public opinion, it generally believes that Roosevelt's speech, in addition to declaring that the country will continue to aid China, avoided stimulating Japan and did not involve the Pacific issue. It can be seen that its focus is on the British issue and temporarily put the Japanese problem behind it to avoid forcing Japan to immediately join Berlin's embrace. It can be seen that Roosevelt's prudent attitude has met Japan's prudent attitude. Although the hostile behavior between the United States and Japan has become increasingly apparent, it has not yet formally broken down. In this way, Foreign Minister Matsuoka should take a diplomatic offensive in both directions in the future, that is, on the one hand, to maintain the current situation with the United States so that Japan can avoid being drawn into the vortex of the world war, and on the other hand, to take advantage of the existing breathing space to resolve the "China Incident." Although President Roosevelt did not make excessive remarks on the current situation, he still made Japan quite uneasy about the future, because the US policy of restoring freedom of the seas is enough to cause a conflict between the US and Germany.

### Japanese Residents in Thailand Surge, Thai Prime Minister's Visit to Japan Not Confirmed

### Japanese-Dutch Negotiations Stalled, Japanese Side Becoming Impatient, Accusing the Dutch East Indies of Lacking Sincerity

Batavia – According to well-informed sources here, economic talks between the Dutch East Indies and Japan are still ongoing, and there has been no change in the situation. The information published in the Japanese newspapers is obviously due to impatience and is not worth considering. Some time ago, it was clearly stated that the delay in the negotiations was not the fault of the Dutch East Indies authorities. (30th Reuters Telegram)

Tokyo – A government spokesman told foreign interviewers today that the insincerity of the Dutch East Indies has brought the economic talks in Batavia to a serious stage. The spokesman said that Japan has asked Britain to mediate the deadlock, but said that it may ask Britain not to interfere. The conversation between British Ambassador Craigie and the Japanese Foreign Minister yesterday only concerned British-Japanese economic matters. The spokesman also said that the Dutch East Indies authorities had promised to ship several types of goods to Japan, but now they have gone back on their word, accusing Japan of shipping them to Germany. In fact, these goods, including oil and rubber, are all used in Japan. When asked if the Dutch East Indies authorities had asked Japan to guarantee not to ship them to Germany, the spokesman replied that he was not sure. He also said that the oil previously agreed upon is still being shipped to Japan, but Japan had requested an increase in the quantity, and the Dutch East Indies authorities initially agreed, but now they have refused. Japan now hopes that they will reconsider their attitude. (30th Reuters Telegram)

### Grand Celebration in Hechuan, Aircraft Donation Naming Ceremony, Over 20,000 People from All Walks of Life Attended, Chairman Chiang Also Sent Representatives to Participate

Hechuan – The Hechuan Aircraft Donation Naming Ceremony Conference was held at the public stadium at 5:00 this morning. The whole city was decorated with flags and banners, which can be called unprecedented in Hechuan. The first salute was fired at 3:00 in the morning, and the second salute was fired at 4:00. Representatives from various agencies and organizations went to the venue, and people from all walks of life actively participated, reaching a total of more than 20,000 people. Chairman Chiang's representative Chen Qingyun, Chairman Zhang's representative Shen Peng, Zheng Yanzhi, factory director of Yufeng Yarn Factory, and Chen Jingqing, the farmer who donated the most money, also attended the meeting. The conference opened at 5:00 in the dim light of dawn. The flag-raising ceremony was held first, and everyone observed three minutes of silence for the air force martyrs and the compatriots who died in the bombing. Shi Zefan, chairman of the conference, gave the opening speech, saying that today is the first anniversary of Hechuan being bombed by Japanese aircraft, and the aircraft donation by the people of Hechuan is of great significance. As a result of the promotion of the one-yuan movement throughout Hechuan County, three aircraft were donated, which is not only unprecedented in Sichuan, but also a model for all parts of the country. This is the greatest honor of the entire Hechuan County, etc. The whole audience applauded enthusiastically. Subsequently, the aircraft donation naming ceremony was held. Three aircraft models of Hechuan, placed in front of the podium, covered with colored chapters, Shi Zefan's wife cut the ribbon, Yuan Xueai, the main committee member of the Aircraft Donation Solicitation Committee, donated the aircraft to the National Government on behalf of the people of the county, and Chen Qingxue accepted it on behalf of the government. Music was played, and the emotions of the whole audience were excited, and the applause continued for several minutes. After the ceremony, Yu, the director of the Micro-Raising Committee, guided the chief Shi Jianqiao to report the fund raising process, which was very detailed. Chen Qingyun, the representative of Chairman Chiang, delivered a speech, offering comfort and encouragement, and said that this year is the year of victory. China today has the most powerful army, and the strengthening of the air force is extremely urgent. It is hoped that the Hechuan aircraft donation will enable the Sichuan Province donation of hundreds of aircraft to be completed as soon as possible, and the whole country will rise up to catch up and imitate the Hechuan spirit, then the final victory will be realized as soon as possible, etc. Subsequently, Shi Jianqiao led the farmer Chen Jingqing to the stage to introduce him to the attendees. At 7:00 in the morning, three Hechuan aircraft flew from a certain place to the sky above Hechuan, flying high and low, performing stunts, and distributing leaflets. After flying around the county for 20 minutes, they flew back to a certain place, and the people cheered and watched them leave. The conference continued, and Wu Zhaotang, acting director of the Scout Training Camp of the Central Training Group, gave a reply before the conference ended.

### Amidst Calls for US Entry into the War: The New-Style Infantry's Majestic Bearing

New York: Although armored forces, dive bombers, and fifth columns are currently in vogue, modern armies still rely on infantry as their backbone. Fifth columns can corrupt the enemy, dive bombers can terrorize the enemy, and armored forces can crush the enemy, but only infantry can hold ground. Therefore, when victory lies in conquering territory, infantry makes the army crucial. A reporter recently traveled six thousand miles, visiting US Army bases, and what he saw was streamlined, modernized, mechanized, and specialized infantry. The old-style infantry was very simple: a dense formation of soldiers, carrying rifles and following their commander, with a few horse-drawn cannons and supply wagons. After research and battlefield tests, infantry officers formed a new-style triangular division, divided into three combat teams, each with an infantry regiment, and its own artillery, engineer, medical, signal, and transportation units. These combat teams can operate independently or in unison. It is said that this triangular division has superior organization, training, and firepower, so even though its combat strength is only fifteen thousand, its effectiveness exceeds the old-style square division. The old-style square division had eighteen thousand men divided into four units and auxiliary units. I visited the famous Second Division at Fort Sam Houston in Texas, reviewing its field work since 1937, which was adopted by the War Department as reference material for organizing the triangular division. The division had 560 officers and 13,500 men, and performed maneuvers before General Pershing and Third Army Commander General Bliss. The division had 1,300 transport vehicles, 267 automobiles, 175 motorcycles, 16 scout cars, 36 105mm howitzers, 12 155mm howitzers, 8 anti-tank guns, and many mortars. The entire division carried 7,199 .45 caliber pistols, 6,943 .30 caliber rifles, 375 Browning Automatic Rifles, 35 submachine guns, and 292 light and heavy machine guns. However, the triangular division has been improved along with vehicles. The streamlined, modernized triangular Fourth Division, commanded by Brigadier General Walter Short at Fort Benning, Georgia, has established the highest standards for infantry firepower and mobility. The Fourth Division is transported by motor vehicles. During field exercises, it used 2,600 vehicles of various types to travel 200 to 300 miles a day, making the division's speed, mobility, and firepower the best of all infantry divisions. I wanted to get a bird's-eye view of how a motorized division moved forward, so I flew over Fort Benning in an Army observation plane. What I saw was an endless column of transport vehicles, motorcycles, scout cars, command cars, armored vehicles, all motorized. This particular unit meandered along a winding road for fifty miles; the entire division would occupy one hundred and fifty miles. Each division, in addition to the basic units, also has an engineer battalion, a signal company, a supply battalion, a motorized reconnaissance company, and military police, and can be assisted by various aircraft and chemical warfare units. In a few weeks, each infantry division will receive fully fortified and highly powerful light vehicles. These vehicles can accommodate four people, have a top speed of one mile per minute, can climb steep slopes and cross valleys, and are very light; if they get stuck in the mud, the soldiers can lift one end. The standard weapon used by the US infantry division is the most powerful in the world. The Springfield rifle, which had a successful track record in previous wars, is being quickly replaced by the Garand rifle. A trained soldier can fire 35 rounds per minute with the Garand rifle, and 150 rounds per minute with the Springfield rifle. The 37mm anti-tank gun can fire 25 one-and-a-half pound high-explosive rounds per minute. The 81mm mortar can fire 18 eleven-pound shells per minute, reaching a height of 70 feet. The Browning .30 caliber machine gun can fire 430 rounds per minute. One afternoon, I watched a live-fire demonstration by a battalion of defenders at Fort Benning, showcasing the full potential of these weapons. At the commander's order, thousands of guns fired simultaneously. Even in broad daylight, the bullets flew clearly visible. From concealed positions, the guns unleashed a barrage of fire, until every square foot of land was riddled with bullet marks. At the same time, the artillery rumbled in the rear, and the shells flew high into the sky. After the tour, I said to an officer, "With a battalion of soldiers using these weapons, I wouldn't dare advance!" He replied, "Oh, there wasn't a battalion, only a platoon (twenty-four men). The crossfire of a battalion is also dangerous for bystanders, because of the risk of ricocheting bullets. I believe you are aware of that." (United Press dispatch, 30th)

The port and airfield also fell into German hands at the same time, and hundreds of British soldiers were captured. Candia has a population of 40,000. (Haitong dispatch, 30th)

Berlin: It was only yesterday that details of the capture of Chania were learned here. The fighting was most intense at the ancient fortress and the village of Galatas, because it was the last important position of the British army. Because the British army had built a continuous line of gun emplacements, the German army's advance was extremely difficult. The German mountain troops engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the British army before capturing the position. As a result, the British positions between Chania and the 2,000-meter-high mountains were shaken. (Haitong dispatch, 30th)

Rome: The British Navy has withdrawn from the vicinity of Crete to Alexandria. A British cruiser was sunk near Crete. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 30th)

### British Forces in North Africa Abandon Sollum

Cairo: The British forces in Tobruk, Libya, launched a successful attack. The enemy forces around Halfaya Pass have not advanced, and their activity is limited to driving the British forces out of their positions. The British forces have abandoned Sollum, because there was a danger of being cut off. The enemy forces now occupy a line from north to south of Halfaya Pass, extending several miles south of the pass. In Abyssinia, the weather is bad, but patriotic Abyssinian forces continue their activities in places such as Debra Tabor and continue to surround the Italian forces, forcing them to surrender. The communiqué also stated that British aircraft attacked Benghazi, hitting the embankment and the factory, causing a large fire. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Cairo: In Libya, the British forces in Tobruk advanced slightly on the night of May 27 to improve their positions and damage the enemy forces. The British forces suffered no losses. British patrols in the Sollum area continue to harass the enemy forces, who occupy the positions covering Halfaya Pass but have made no further attempts to advance. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### Tunis Bombed: France Should Bear the Blame: The Port Should Not Be Used by Italy: Britain Has Not Received a Protest from Vichy

London: Responsible sources in London confirmed last night that the Royal Air Force bombed the port of Sfax in Tunisia on May 28. A ship in the port caught fire. Nothing is known about the claim that the French ship "La Pelleya" was hit by a bomb. However, if "La Pelleya" was hit by a bomb while attacking Italian ships sheltering in the port, the blame lies with the French authorities for allowing enemy ships to operate and shelter from the rain from Tunisian waters and ports. The British government has already notified the Vichy government that Britain cannot recognize France's right to neutrality, and has issued a special warning to Vichy about the use of Tunisian waters. The British Air Force Command in Cairo issued a communiqué last night announcing that the British Air Force, which attacked the port of Sfax, Tunisia, hit a 4,000- to 5,000-ton motor ship with bombs. All the bombs dropped by the British aircraft hit their targets. Judging from the violent explosion and thick smoke after the ship was hit, the ship was clearly carrying munitions. (Reuters, 30th)

London: No protest has been received here from Vichy regarding the British air raid on Sfax in Tunisia. If the claim that Washington has received this protest is indeed true, then this protest has not yet been sent to London. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### Chief of Staff of Fascist Militia Dismissed: Replaced by Garbolsti

### European War Chat (5)(9): London's Culture Under Bombs

In the 17th and 18th centuries, when newspapers had not yet become a force, prominent British writers generally used the publication of pamphlets as the most powerful medium for mobilizing public opinion. In modern times, this method of propaganda has rarely been noticed, but during this European war, it has become fashionable again.

The reason for the popularity of pamphlets is, on the one hand, that newspapers have reduced their size and do not have enough space for people to express their opinions and comment on the current situation. On the other hand, long works are affected by the rapidly changing situation and are difficult to suit the times. Publishers are naturally unwilling to publish a book that has become yesterday's news before it is published. But there is no risk in printing a sixty-four-page pamphlet. It can be written in one week, printed in two weeks, and immediately sold throughout the country.

Famous writers and publishers are now competing to publish pamphlets. Some pamphlets, priced at six pence each, are not reprints of old books, but are all brand-new materials, stacked prominently on bookstore counters, and sell as well as steamed buns just out of the steamer.

Among the writers of pamphlets, there are many outstanding figures, such as Sir Norman Angell, Ramsay Muir, Harold Nicolson, and Wickham Steed. Even the famous H.G. Wells does not demean himself by writing six-pence pamphlets. As for general authoritative scholars and historians, they do not hesitate to sell their brains for three-pence books. Anyone who spends this small amount can purchase any type of current affairs pamphlet published by Oxford University Press. Whether these pamphlets can be equated with the pamphlets of the seventeenth century in the future literary history is difficult to predict, but at least they will have some influence on society.

Holin, the editor of the magazine "Modern Life and Literature," once complained that writers have fewer outlets than other artists during wartime. Painters are allowed to go to the battlefield to take pictures for the country to preserve, but writers do not have equal rights. This man's argument is not really to the point, because writers also have the opportunity to observe the home front during wartime. Even people who are over the age for military service, if they are happy to write, do not have to worry about not finding good material.

The lives of wartime literati vary, but they are mostly focused on shifting reality. For example, Ms. Lehman said that she is impatient with everything, but she enjoys reading famous novels to pass the time. Walpole also said that since the start of the war, he has read a scene from Shakespeare's plays every morning before getting out of bed, enjoying it immensely and never interrupting it.

The literary critic塞尔曾在曼哲期德晚报上 said in the "Manchested Evening News" that he now likes to study metaphysics and nature poetry, living in two worlds of crazy reality and daytime dreams. He also believes that the best wartime reading is the diaries of famous people. Novels are too empty, biographies are enough to encourage people, but cannot escape reality, and history? History is being made and there is nothing to read. Poetry? It seems that it can be read, but as Edgar Allan Poe said, the greatest poetry cannot be enjoyed for more than half an hour. Only diaries are just right.

But麦克卡泰 holds a different view, believing that in this difficult autumn, reading poetry, if you can understand it with your heart, is actually more beneficial than novels. Poetry gives people a moment of life experience. If readers can understand the poet's experience, they will have the joy of being resourceful. So he is now studying poetry.

Since the start of the war, book sales have plummeted. According to the "Publishers' Annual," only 10,732 books were published last year, a decrease of 4,179 from the previous year, a drop of 39 percent. Among them, children's books are the most unsalable, followed by novels, sociology books, science textbooks, notes, and travelogues.

Another major challenge for the British publishing industry is the issue of taxation. The government's new budget has divided commodity taxes into two categories: luxury goods are taxed at 24 percent, and other items, including books, are taxed at 12 percent. Newspapers and periodicals will also be taxed accordingly. When the House of Commons discussed the bill, Member of Parliament Herbert was the first to express his opposition, calling it absurd to levy a small tax on book publishing. He said that the "knowledge tax" had been eliminated between 1850 and 1870, and the principle of exempting spiritual reading materials from taxation was established, which had not changed through two world wars. How could the current Secretary of the Treasury recklessly destroy it? At the same time, members of parliament organized a "Committee to Defend Books" to advocate against book taxes. In London, this matter is called "a battle for books."

Finally, a Labour Party member proposed an amendment, saying that the book tax was very small and would be enough to affect exports, so it would be better to exempt it. The Secretary of the Treasury felt this was reasonable and decided to accept it. However, the "Committee to Defend Books" believes that this initial success is not permanent and does not intend to dissolve the organization immediately. However, this "battle for books" can be said to have come to an end.

### Jinghua Elementary and Middle School Teachers Go on Strike Yesterday

Due to their inability to maintain their livelihoods, all teachers and staff members of Jinghua Elementary and Middle School on Haifang Road held a meeting on May 3rd and unanimously passed four demands to present to the school administration. Four weeks have passed since then, and the principal has ignored them. According to a representative of the teachers and staff who spoke to a reporter from Dahua News Agency yesterday, the teachers and staff have repeatedly made concessions under the principle of not striking, hoping to reach an understanding with the school administration and appealing to the students' parents for sympathy and assistance. Related parties have also sent personnel to mediate, but the principal has avoided negotiations, and no progress has been made. Therefore, the teachers and staff began their strike yesterday, resulting in a stalemate. In addition, a letter received from the Jinghua Education Department stated: "To whom it may concern, yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival, and our school was closed as usual. During dismissal, one or two teachers distributed leaflets outside the school gates, falsely claiming to represent all teachers and staff. The language used was inappropriate for the education sector and incited strikes. Our school currently has teachers and staff with years of service in education who deeply understand educational principles and are still teaching as usual. To prevent the outside world from misunderstanding the truth, we hereby declare this."

### Yesterday's May 30th Commemoration: Shanghai's Various Circles Pledge to Serve the Country; Carrying on the Martyrs' Legacy to Fight for Freedom and Liberation; May Joint Defense Precaution to End Tomorrow

Yesterday was the 16th anniversary of the May 30th Massacre. Various circles in Shanghai commemorated the martyrs who sacrificed their lives, expressing deep sorrow. They maintained a silent demeanor as a solemn memorial. The concession authorities, considering the unstable situation and the fact that yesterday was the end-of-month settlement period for the Dragon Boat Festival, maintained strict vigilance throughout the day, deploying more detectives to patrol the roads and inspect suspicious pedestrians and vehicles to prevent incidents. The details are as follows:

Solemnly Commemorating the May 30th Martyrs

Various circles, recognizing the unique environment of Shanghai, did not engage in extravagant May 30th commemorations. Instead, they expressed spiritual mourning with unwavering resolve and solemn emotions, and automatically observed a moment of silence, paying homage to the revolutionary pioneers and martyrs. They vowed to follow the martyrs' legacy, serve as role models for future generations, work together to strive for freedom and liberation, endure hardship to avenge national humiliation and family grievances.

End-of-Month Settlement for the Dragon Boat Festival Passed Peacefully

Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival settlement day. All businesses, markets, and the money industry were closed for holiday. Companies, firms, and shops handled settlements, sending staff to collect outstanding customer debts. The market and finance remained stable, and all sectors peacefully passed this important period. Shanghai citizens continued the old customs, celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with rice dumplings and lycee, doubling the market price. However, the Refugee Relief Association appealed to all sectors to conserve resources and help the refugees.

May Joint Defense Ends Successfully

Since the two concession authorities implemented the May Joint Defense on May 1st, they have handled the situation properly, allowing all anniversaries to pass peacefully. Because of the Dragon Boat Festival settlement and the May 30th commemoration yesterday, the authorities also implemented special precautions and the day passed peacefully. As the Joint Defense period has ended, the authorities have decided to lift the Joint Defense starting at 5:00 AM tomorrow. However, for the welfare and safety of citizens and local order, ordinary precautions will continue to be implemented to prevent petty criminals from becoming active.

### American Legion Gathering Last Night

### French Authorities Establish Liaison Officer to Improve Relations with Japan; Mr. Pang Mochang Appointed

Mr. Pang Mochang, former First Secretary of the French Embassy in Tokyo, has served in the French diplomatic community in Tokyo for about 30 years. He retired a few months ago and was awarded the Fourth Class Order by the Japanese government. Mr. Pang has now been appointed as a special liaison officer by the French authorities here and departed from Japan on the 29th of this month. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai today (31st) to take office, responsible for handling French-Japanese affairs on behalf of the French authorities. It is reported that Mr. Pang speaks fluent Japanese, and it is generally expected that relations between the French and Japanese authorities here will soon improve.

### Haiyi Vessel Sold; Price: 180,000 Yuan

The Haiyi vessel, owned by the German Far East Shipping Company, has a capacity of over 200 tons and operates in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Jiangbei ports, as well as the eastern Zhejiang area. Recently, due to the monopolization of Yangtze River transport and the blockade of eastern Zhejiang, it has had no place to operate and has been out of service for a long time. It is reported that it has recently been purchased by China Central Shipping Company for a price of 180,000 yuan in legal currency. The transaction has already been completed. The vessel was formerly known as the Donghai and was later renamed Haiyi after flying the German flag. The hull is made of wood. After the China Central Shipping Company purchased it, it is currently undergoing repairs and will continue to operate in the small Yangtze River in the future.

### Eighteen Taxi Companies Go on Strike; Labor and Management Stalemate

The drivers and mechanics of eighteen smaller taxi companies in this city, including Yitai, Huali, Jiangsu, Youning, Shijie, Yazhou, Yuegong, etc., have recently faced high rice prices and difficult living conditions. They jointly requested a 50% increase in rice subsidies (based on the original rice subsidy) from the employers some time ago. However, the employers rejected their request, and the workers went on strike starting at midnight on the 25th of last month. It is learned that the employers issued a warning to the workers the day before yesterday, requiring them to resume work within three days, otherwise new workers would be hired. However, two days have passed since the warning was issued, and if the workers do not respond today, it may be difficult to resolve the issue in the short term.

### Land and Water Transport Restored in Jinhua, Lishui, and Yongkang

The war situation in eastern Zhejiang has stabilized, and Haimen, Wenzhou, and other places have been successively recovered. Passenger buses between Jinhua and Lishui, and between Yongkang and Lishui, have resumed service yesterday. Previously interrupted, they have now resumed service. Passenger buses from Lishui to Longquan have also resumed service. It is also learned that fast boats between Lishui, Bihu, and Songyang have also resumed navigation. They depart from Lishui at 4:30 AM every day. The fares are temporarily set at 15 yuan from Lishui to Songyang, 4 yuan from Lishui to Bihu, and 7 yuan from Lishui to Dagangtou.

### Exploring Roosevelt's Speech: The United States Has Not Neglected Japan; Japan is the Second Weak Link in the Axis; Western Newspapers Speculate on Future American Strategy

Yesterday, the Continental Daily editorial continued to discuss President Roosevelt's fireside chat, stating that since President Roosevelt's fireside chat, the US government's policy has been clearly expressed. The US policy includes (1) providing as much material assistance to China and Britain as possible, (2) maintaining freedom of the seas, (3) protecting the Western Hemisphere from all aggression, and (4) supporting these policies with force when necessary. Although Japan's response to US policy is not as strong as Germany's, if Japan's foreign policy does not change, the US's hostility towards Japan will not be less than that towards Germany. Some Chinese people have expressed disappointment with President Roosevelt's speech because it did not guarantee direct action against Japan. However, we must know that it would be unwise to state in advance where the US armed forces will first launch their attack. If we study the US strategy carefully, we can know that the US will not neglect the harm Japan can do. The US may even deal with Japan before dealing with Germany. Strategically speaking, it is best to seek out the weak points in the enemy's line and attack them first. Italy has already been defeated, and the second weak link in the Axis line is Japan.

### American Community Commemorates Fallen Soldiers; Memorial Service Held; US Consul and Bishop Hall Participate; Cullem Encourages American Loyalty and Patriotism

The United States has traditionally designated May 30th as Memorial Day to commemorate fallen soldiers. The American community in Shanghai gathered at the Jing'an Temple Cemetery at 8:30 AM yesterday (May 30th) to hold a memorial service, presided over by US Consul General Lockehead and with prayers by Bishop Hall.

Remembering the Martyrs, Defending Democracy

Then, US military chaplain Cullem delivered a speech, encouraging compatriots to be loyal and patriotic and to remember the senior comrades who sacrificed their lives for the country. His exhortation stated, "Today's citizens, respecting the martyrs, should practice the ideals sought by the martyrs in past wars and protect the even nobler ideals that form the foundation and soul of our democratic system. The best way to commemorate the fallen soldiers is to resolutely resist anything that destroys these noble ideals."

Playing the National Anthem, Solemn and Respectful

Following this, the blessing was given by Dr. Mindes, President of the Overseas American Association, and the US Marine Corps Band played the national anthem. A squad of US sailors and the American team of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps were present. The solemn and respectful service ended with the sound of a bugle played by a Navy bugler. According to reports, American Memorial Day originated after the end of the American Civil War, when General Logan expressed his approval of scattering flowers on the graves of fallen soldiers. He then issued an order designating May 30, 1868, as the first Memorial Day. Since then, the practice of scattering flowers and national flags on the graves of fallen soldiers has continued to this day and has become a convention.

### Iranian Minister to Japan Makes a Short Stay in Shanghai

Iranian Minister to Japan, Nojem, passed through Shanghai. Yesterday, he told a Western reporter that the Iranian people are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the European war. Although their location is close to the Iraqi war zone, their daily lives and work continue as usual without interruption. Nojem said that this was his first time in the Far East, so he planned to stay in Shanghai for a while before going to Tokyo. He said that Shanghai is a wonderful city, but he did not compare it to any Iranian city. He said that the extravagance of Shanghai is even greater than that of Europe, which he found quite peculiar. He did not want to comment much on the outcome of the European war. He said that his trip to Shanghai was of a private nature, so he did not want to get involved in political issues. Nojem was deeply amazed by the diversity of languages spoken in Shanghai and regretted not knowing English.

### Japanese Warships Shell Sailing Boats off Zhenhai's Sanshanpu; Seven Killed or Injured

Off the coast of Zhenhai's Sanshanpu, at 9:00 PM on the 7th of this month, five sailing boats from the Jintang area were sailing towards Xinqi when they were suddenly spotted by two small Japanese warships anchored off Sanshanpu. The warships immediately fired more than 20 shells at them, hitting two of the boats, which immediately sank. Passengers Zhang Changxin, Hong Fangyu, Yao Zhenfa, Wang Afeng, Xu Alin, and others were killed, and Yao Axiang, Chen Kaitai, and others were injured. The luggage and belongings on board were also swept away by the waves. After shelling, the Japanese warships immediately sailed to the Jintang coast and anchored. After the incident, local residents and boatmen went into the sea to rescue people and recovered 16 passengers, including Zheng Zhuangbao, as well as the injured Yao Axiang and others. They also recovered the bodies of five men and women and many pieces of luggage. In addition to notifying the families of the victims and collecting the bodies, they also sent the injured passengers to the hospital for treatment.

### Earlier Hours for French Concession Sanitation Work

The Sanitation Department of the French Concession Municipal Council, in view of the arrival of summer, the increasing heat, and the denser population within the concession compared to previous years, and considering that the spread of epidemics is easy to spread if citizens do not pay attention to hygiene at this time, is urgently implementing various public health measures. In addition to starting free vaccinations, the Municipal Council has decided that starting from June 1st (tomorrow), all garbage trucks within the concession, originally scheduled to start work at 4:00 AM every day, will start work earlier at 12:00 AM every day. This is to ensure that the fresh air within the concession at dawn is not polluted by the stench. It is also heard that the time for clearing garbage within the concession will also be advanced.

### Suspension of Cotton Cloth Parcel Deliveries to Various Postal Areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Henan, and Shanghai

### All Rice Merchants in the City Must Register Their Rice Stock with the Bureau; Stock Already Arrived Should Report the Name of the Warehouse Where It Is Stored; Stock Not Yet Arrived Should Fill in the Route of Transportation

The authorities of the two concessions, in view of the rising tide of labor unrest in various industries and the instability of social order, mostly caused by the rapid rise in rice prices, the two authorities are sparing no effort to curb rice prices and stabilize the people's food supply. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the concession authorities yesterday that the two authorities have decided to take more effective measures to stabilize the food supply in Shanghai. They have already ordered the Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association to immediately notify all members of the industry to truthfully report all domestic and foreign rice stocks, whether they have arrived or are in transit, so that formal statistics can be compiled. It is reported that the authorities made thorough research before taking this measure, which is considered the only effective way to prevent the transfer of rice and grain to other ports and to crack down on speculation and hoarding. It is reported that the registration method is divided into (A) items that have already arrived at the warehouse: (1) name and address of the warehouse where the rice is stored, (2) quantity stored, (3) type of rice, (4) name of the owner of the goods, (5) address of the owner of the goods, (6) date of arrival at the warehouse, (7) cost price of the rice, etc.; (B) items that have not arrived: (1) foreign rice handled on behalf of others, (2) rice transport vehicle, (3) date of arrival, (4) origin of the rice, (5) name of the person who placed the order, (6) intended warehouse for storage, (7) type of rice, (8) cost price, (9) name and address of the orderer's business, etc.

Additional Import Rice Can Be Approved and Issued Today

In the rice market these days, due to some purchases from inland areas and for re-export, rice merchants are taking the opportunity to engage in speculation and raise prices. As a result, retail rice shops have also raised prices at the same time. Residents are buying affordable imported rice, causing sales in rice shops to increase sharply. Various grain stores have requested additional purchases from Xiang Mao Foreign Firm. It is currently under review. It is expected that the amount each store can be allocated may be announced this morning. Furthermore, according to a letter from Jin Feng Rice Store, the previous report that the store was subject to a suspension of sales of imported rice has been clarified with Li Ji Foreign Firm. The registration was duplicated, resulting in a misunderstanding. They have already resumed shipping and selling through distributors.

Da Fu Foreign Firm's Second Sale

In order to suppress the market price of tribute rice transported to Shanghai for sale, the French Concession Public Works Bureau previously ordered various foreign firms handling tribute rice that, regardless of the quality of tribute rice they handle in the future, they must not set prices privately for the rice to be sold after it arrives in port. All prices must be approved by the authorities. All foreign firms have now complied with the order. Therefore, the market price of tribute rice sold in this city will gradually decline. Da Fu Foreign Firm had previously sold No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon mixed broken rice at a market price of 98.8 yuan per bag. According to the foreign firm's announcement yesterday, they sold approximately 450 tons of broken rice yesterday, with the market price approved by the French authorities at 97.5 yuan per bag. The stated prices are the prices at which the foreign firm sells to rice merchants. As for the rice merchants' resale, they are given a generous profit margin of 8% or 5%.

Large Quantities of Tribute Rice Arrive in Succession

According to a person in charge of the French Postal Shipping Company yesterday, the company's ship "Beina Ting Sheng Billa" arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM on the 20th of this month via Saigon and Manila. The ship was berthed at Hongkou. The ship carried 12,000 bags of tribute rice. The "Tao Li Shi" arrived here yesterday from Saigon. In addition to carrying 5,200 bags of tribute rice, the ship also carried 6,900 tons of Annam coal. The "Kai Ting" ship is expected to arrive today, but the amount of rice it carries was not reported accurately yesterday. The above-mentioned tribute rice has already begun to be unloaded. According to rice industry sources, the tribute rice carried by the above ships is mostly broken rice, with a cost price of only about 100 yuan per bag. Therefore, the cost for rice merchants is very low. In the coming days, large quantities of tribute rice will continue to be shipped here.

### French Postal Ship "Xia Fei" Did Not Set Sail Yesterday; Rumor Has It That the Crew Suddenly Caused Disturbances

It was learned yesterday that the departure date of the French postal ship "Xia Fei" from Shanghai to Vietnam has been postponed. It is widely believed that this was caused by disturbances among the ship's crew. Rumor has it that several of the company's oil-burning ships sailing between Shanghai and Vietnam will be suspended due to fuel shortages. Furthermore, yesterday morning (the 30th), there were rumors outside that the schedules of the French Postal Shipping Company's ships had been cancelled. This statement was denied by Ke Xide, the company's general manager for the Far East. However, Mr. Ke refused to explain why the "Xia Fei," which was originally scheduled to depart on the 29th, had not sailed even by yesterday morning. Well-informed sources said that the crew of the "Xia Fei" suddenly caused disturbances when the ship was about to set sail, and the details are currently unknown. On the other hand, it is said that the French Postal Shipping Company's oil-burning ships will be suspended, while the coal-burning ships will continue to operate as usual. An employee of the company said that the company expects five more ships to arrive in Shanghai before June 10, which shows that the ships have not been completely suspended.

### Disaster Area Reconstruction Bonds to Be Drawn for Redemption

The total amount of the Shanghai Disaster Area Reconstruction Bonds is 6 million national currency. It was underwritten by British Liyan Foreign Firm at 80% of the face value. Now, in order to maintain creditworthiness, although Shanghai has fallen, the principal and interest of the bonds are being repaid on schedule. The 17th drawing for redemption was held at HSBC Bank the day before yesterday. The two winning numbers were 34 and 43, each worth 60,000 yuan, totaling 120,000 yuan in principal repayment. The principal and interest due will be paid by British HSBC Bank starting from June 15th and is expected to continue until December 15, 1952, when all principal and interest will be fully repaid. The majority of bondholders are foreign residents in Shanghai, who deeply admire the Chinese government's maintenance of creditworthiness.

### Kong Zhiqing Bonsai Exhibition

Bonsai expert Kong Zhiqing is famous at sea for his expertise in making waterscape bonsai. He won the highest award in the business group at the Sino-Western Flower Show. Chinese and Western gentlemen and ladies who have seen his works have all praised him. In response to the requests of bonsai enthusiasts, he is holding a bonsai exhibition at 165 Haig Road (intersection of Shanzhong Road) starting today.

### Temporary Electricity Surcharge Calculated According to US Dollar Exchange Rate; Electricity Company Announced Implementation Yesterday; Expected to Be Reduced According to Current Exchange Rate

After the Public Works Bureau approved the price increase for public utilities in the Public Concession starting from July 1st, the Shanghai Electric Power Company issued a public notice yesterday stating, "With the approval of the Shanghai Public Works Bureau, in addition to the current foreign exchange and fuel surcharges, an additional

temporary surcharge

will be added to the basic electricity rates for all types of power supply. This surcharge is 50%, based on an exchange rate of 5.25 US dollars to 100 national currency, and will be adjusted monthly by the Public Works Bureau and the company in accordance with the fluctuations in the exchange rate, following the procedures stipulated for the foreign exchange surcharge. The newly revised surcharge will apply to bills for electricity periods ending on or after

July 1, 1941,

and is subject to the various terms and conditions accepted by the company." At that time, the black market foreign exchange had shrunk to a tightest price of 5.125 US dollars, hence this calculation rate. However, the current black market exchange rate has been extended to 5.40625, an extension of more than five levels (i.e., 5.28125, 3125, 34375, 375, 40625). The international situation is deteriorating, and the black market exchange rate may continue to rise. Therefore, the calculation rate of the new surcharge must be reduced at that time.

### Smoking Should Be Strictly Prohibited in Factories and Airports

Public Concession Fire Department investigation: A major fire occurred at Jingwu Toy Factory, 749 Kunming Road, Hudong, on the 28th, causing a loss of 200,000 yuan and burning to death one worker. The cause was a worker dropping a lit cigarette. It has been found that celluloid toy raw materials and gasoline are extremely flammable when ignited. Therefore, all factories and airports have been urged to strictly prohibit workers from smoking cigarettes in order to prevent unfortunate tragedies.

### Overseas Chinese in Burma Plan to Establish Sino-Burmese National Goods Company

Recently, many overseas Chinese in Burma have jointly funded the establishment of the Sino-Burmese National Goods Company in order to facilitate the sale of domestic products and promote Sino-Burmese trade. The headquarters will be located in Yangon, with a capital of 300,000 Burmese kyats, borne by the Burmese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the China National Goods Company, and the Bank of China, each contributing 100,000 Burmese kyats. The company's planning is progressing smoothly. In the future, the goods sold will be exclusively domestic products. At that time, letters will be sent to various domestic goods organizations in this city to introduce genuine domestic goods factories so that they can directly contact and ship goods on schedule for consignment sales. At the same time, it is hoped that efforts will be made to improve the following points: (1) The delivery date should be accurate, (2) The packaging method should be precise, (3) The price should be preferential and self-sacrificing.

### Three French Ships Arrive in Shanghai

The French Postal Shipping Company cargo ship "Beina Ting Sheng Billa" arrived in Shanghai on the 29th from Saigon. The new ship "Tao Li Zi" arrived yesterday, and the "Kai Ting" ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The three French ships arrived in succession, all carrying huge amounts of rice.

### Eyewitness Account of a Brain Dissection (Continued from Yesterday)

— Xian Li

Dr. Su used cotton wool dipped in iodine to rub the shaved area on the right side of the patient's head, as calmly as a barber applying hair oil to a customer's head. After repeating the rubbing several times, he began to inject a large amount of local anesthetic into the area to be operated on, first subcutaneous injection, then intramuscular injection. The patient's right skull seemed to be hurt, and a small bump swelled up.

After the injection was completed, Dr. Su picked up a knife and drew a two-and-a-half-inch-long "king" character on the bump, with the top and bottom strokes half as short as the middle stroke. This mark was the basis for the later operation.

The nurse handed over a piece of white canvas with a hole in the middle, covering the patient's head, leaving only the long "king" character written on the flesh with a knife. Dr. Su skillfully picked up two safety pins, like a mother changing a diaper for an infant, and pinned the cloth to the patient's scalp.

Dr. Su picked up a sharp knife and cut down on the vertical stroke of the "king" character on the patient's head. The skin broke, blood flowed, and the nurse handed over the clamps one by one. Dr. Su took them and clamped the bleeding blood vessels under the patient's skin one by one. The bleeding stopped, and my pounding heart calmed down.

Dr. Su aimed at the wound and continued to cut down. In the fifteen minutes after the operation, he had cut to the patient's skull. The white skull bone was clearly visible in the two-and-a-half-inch-long, one-inch-wide red flesh seam.

After a short rest, and using a suction tube to suck away the blood at any time, Dr. Su picked up a large drill and rotated it on the patient's skull. An assistant dripped a transparent, colorless liquid on the right side. Dr. Su spent a lot of effort to drill a round hole the size of a one-cent nickel coin in the patient's skull. Taking out the circular skull bone, Dr. Su said casually in English, "Her bone is quite hard?"

Using this small round hole as a base, Dr. Su used pliers to clamp out small pieces of the patient's skull bone, clamping it into a one-and-a-half-inch square hole. The patient's meninges were jumping inside the bone hole.

The patient groaned in a coma, "It hurts! It hurts so much!" The assistant doctor and the nurse laughed. The patient groaned again, "I want to die!" Dr. Su patted the canvas covering the patient's head with his hand. The sound of the suction machine's motor and the patient's snoring merged into one.

Using that small base, Dr. Su was developing the site with his skillful wrist. He sometimes used a knife, sometimes electricity, sometimes a suction machine, sometimes pliers, sometimes cotton wool, sometimes gauze, sometimes bone wax, and dug down towards the patient's cheek step by step. The damage to the suction machine's motor took up some necessary time. Other than that, the operation proceeded smoothly.

Dr. Su found the nerve that was causing trouble on the patient's cheek at nearly 3:45. At this time, Dr. Su stopped and asked the nurse what the patient's blood pressure and pulse were, and then instructed the assistant to inject the patient with a blood tonic. Then, he pointed out the white nerve in the flesh seam to the two doctors and me who were watching. Then, he used a knife and electricity to destroy the nerve.

"Do you want to see the human brain?" Dr. Su turned his head and asked me with a smile. I couldn't say anything, so I just nodded. He cut the meninges that were jumping in the patient's skull seam into a one-inch-long tear, and the human brain was clearly revealed.

The operation was completed. The patient lost a piece of skull bone and also lost the pain caused by the nerve. Like a seamstress, Dr. Su took the clip of semi-circular needles and catgut from the nurse's hand and sewed up the wound on the patient one stitch at a time, with an assistant tying the knots. First, he sewed the muscles, first two layers, and then the skin once.

When the assistant doctor was bandaging the patient's wound, it was already half past four. We watched Dr. Su step out of the operating room. Dr. Jiang picked up the skull model and explained the dissected part to us with great interest. He said that near the nerve that had just been destroyed, there were large blood vessels and other nerves. If he was not careful, the patient would be in danger. It was like an explorer describing his adventurous experiences.

I re-entered the dressing room, took off the white hat, untied the mask, took off the blood-stained white coat, and put on my original clothes again. When I stepped out of the dressing room, Dr. Su was washing his arms vigorously again.

When I walked out of the Red Cross, it was already five o'clock. The scorching sun of May shone on the body of a tired and exhausted fake doctor. His body was tired, but his spirit was excited for the continuation of the medical world. He praised the progress of medicine. (The End)

### Foreign Traveler Talks About the Situation in Free France; People Lack Nutrition and Have a Sallow Complexion; Oppose Germany and Italy and Eagerly Hope for a British Victory

A certain foreign traveler, who did not want to reveal his name for political reasons, traveled in France for four months and recently arrived in Shanghai. He told reporters yesterday that the people in the Free French region are suffering greatly from famine, and there is a possibility of an epidemic soon. The impact on the next generation of French people will be unimaginable, perhaps similar to the situation in Russia in 1928.

The People's Livelihood Reaches the Extreme of Hardship

The tragedy he saw was more terrible than the collapse of politics and the military. Now, children with sallow complexions are everywhere, and many are sick due to malnutrition. In the un-occupied area, butter and meat are no longer available. The government rations adults, with only two slices of bread per day. Meat is only issued once a week. Most families only have vegetables for lunch and dinner every day, and only vegetable soup for breakfast.

Unanimously Hope for a British Victory

Except for the officials in the Vichy government, the political life of the French people has ceased to exist due to famine and defeat. But in terms of their political ideas, there are now two factions with equal strength. One is pro-British, whose slogan is "May our friend Britain win." The other is anti-British, whose slogan is "May the hateful Britain win."

Marshal Petain is Highly Respected

In the Free French region, Marshal Petain is highly respected. The general public firmly believes that although he is old, he presides over the Vichy government under German pressure. Besides Marshal Petain, there seems to be no more suitable person to rely on. Laval's reputation is not well-known, and he may not be able to achieve his goal of becoming a leader. The youth movement of the centralized front is no longer seen among the French people, and even German propaganda activities have disappeared.

The People Crave News from Abroad

Unemployment is very common in France. However, most young people are forced to join the "Youth Camp" to build roads for the government or engage in other public works. French people obtain news about the outside world from government-managed radio stations and newspapers. However, reading Swiss newspapers is not prohibited. The authorities do not explicitly prohibit individuals from listening to British broadcasts, so French people who have radios and are proficient in English can listen.

British Citizens are Well Treated in France

There are still many British citizens in Cannes, France. They cannot remit funds to the UK. However, French innkeepers or landlords are willing to allow them to delay paying for food and lodging until after the war. There are also many Jews in France. They are quite wealthy, and the anti-Jewish laws announced by the Vichy government under Nazi pressure are not very strict.

Anti-Italian Sentiment is Higher Than Everything Else

The French people have no anti-Jewish sentiments. The only countries that French people hate the most are Germany and Italy. However, the French hate Italians even more than Germans. The French believe that Germany is still fighting with open guns, while Italians are attacking with hidden arrows. At present, the French people use bicycles instead of cars due to the lack of gasoline. Even the former car-owning class must now ride bicycles.

### Fire at Wang Dayou Candle Store; Child's Body Pulled Out

At 11:20 PM the night before last, a fire suddenly broke out at Wang Dayou Candle Store, 682 Guangxi Road, Jiujiang Road, Public Concession. The flames soared into the sky and were unstoppable. After receiving the news, the fire brigade rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until after 12:00 AM. In addition to destroying the store, the fire also spread to five neighboring buildings, including Lu Gaojian Meat Store, Baolong Sauce Garden, Hongfa Xiang Paper Shop, and Beiping Mingfa Tang Pharmacy. When the fire was raging, a resident, Wu Shutang (43 years old), and his wife, Wu Shou (39 years old), were seriously injured while escaping. They were sent to the hospital for treatment. At 4:00 AM yesterday morning, firefighters pulled out the body of a child from the rubble. It was found to be the daughter of the owner of Wang Dayou Candle Store, only nine years old. She unfortunately died in the fire. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination.

### Jueyuan Buddhist Pure Land Society Provides Free Medical Care and Medicine; Life is Extremely Difficult, Medical Treatment is Crowded; Expenses are Huge, Hope for Donations

The charity department of the Jueyuan Buddhist Pure Land Society on Hede Road has been providing free Chinese and Western medical care and medicine for 15 years. Every day from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, each person is charged a registration fee of 40 cents (poor patients are still exempt). Chinese medicine is given for one dose, and Western medicine is given for two days. The amount varies. If serious patients need injections, they will be given injections. Therefore, in 1940 alone, there were more than 66,000 registrations. There are even more this year, with more than 200 registrations every day. Because Chinese and Western medicine are expensive, and the price of everything is soaring, the middle class also has difficulty making a living, and many go to the society for medical treatment. Therefore, people are more crowded and expenses are greater. The society never solicits donations from the outside. Since the increase in medical visits, expenses have increased more than ten times. It relies solely on the organizers to raise funds and feels deeply exhausted. Now that summer is approaching, medical services will inevitably become more developed. If people from all walks of life have sympathy for the society's cause, they will be able to donate more to help solve the difficulty of public medical problems.

### Pickpockets Arrested in the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track

Guangdong pickpocket king Ye Caibang, 30 years old, Li Xitian, 26 years old, Zhou Zhuo, 28 years old, and more than ten others recently came to Shanghai from Hong Kong. They were dressed in suits and leather shoes and behaved lavishly. Those who did not know them thought they were wealthy young men. They often used large hotels as gathering places. The night before last, they went to the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track on Albert Road in the French Concession to practice their skills. It was learned by French patrolmen and detectives Ke Enqing and Wang Yuanqi, who arrested Wang and the other three and took them to the police station for custody, awaiting the arrest of accomplices for joint investigation.

### Dong Yugui Chopped with an Ax

Dong Yugui, 38 years old, unemployed, lives at 4 Zhong'an Lane, Edward Road, French Concession. His wife is a performer of Shanghai opera at Tianchan Teahouse on Yu Qiaqing Road. At around 12:00 AM the night before last, Dong returned home from the teahouse with his wife and mother-in-law. When they arrived at the entrance of the lane, Dong went to the adjacent cigarette store to buy cigarettes. The mother and daughter went inside first. As soon as they arrived home, they suddenly heard Dong calling for help. They rushed out to see Dong lying on the ground, his head and hands severely chopped, and seriously injured. An ax was left beside him. The injured person was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. It is said that it was impossible to identify the perpetrator at the time, and he did not know the reason for the attack. Dong had recently worked in a gambling den in Nanshi and usually made a living by lending money at high interest rates. This attack was probably due to a personal vendetta.

### Nephew Assaults Aunt

The person from 774 Lane 2, Hai Zai Road, Shen Qiusheng, is addicted to gambling and does not work. He often insulted his elders for trivial matters. Last month, he beat his aunt, Cai Shen. The victim had no choice but to file a private prosecution. On the 28th of this month, the court ruled that Shen Qiusheng injured another person's body and was fined 100 yuan as a warning. If he is to perform corvée labor, he is to be paid at two yuan per day.

### A Record of the Solo Exhibition of Young Calligrapher Wen Yongchen

Wen Yongchen's calligraphy exhibition on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company is full of beautiful works. Among the exhibits, thousands of words in small regular script are written on paper less than an inch square, which is beautiful and dignified, and can be described as a unique skill. There is also an inscription of maxims, more than three feet long, with a line of small regular script resembling hair hanging in the air, upright and beautiful. Looking at this small regular script with a microscope, one feels amazed. The handwriting is magnified under the microscope, the strokes are clear, and the characters are meticulously done. Introduced by the person in charge of Daxin Company, I met Mr. Wen. Upon meeting, I realized that Mr. Wen is a young calligrapher, humble and polite. He said that the exhibition was prepared in less than a week, and each work is exquisite and perfect, truly a masterpiece. Mr. Wen wields his brush on the spot, using the brush in the same way as ordinary people, without the aid of any magnifying glass, which surprised the reporter greatly.

### Foreign Rice Pouring In

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. A French company had a ship arrive the day before yesterday, directly from Xishi (Saigon), carrying over 30,000 bags of rice. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Dulis arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying over 5,000 bags from Saigon, which are being unloaded and transferred at buoys 14 and 15. It is said that the Jindiya is expected to arrive today, but the amount of foreign rice it is carrying is not yet known until the ship arrives. The Taikoo Company's Guiyang arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying only 300 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Today, 3,620 bags of corn will be loaded onto the Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng, which will transport it to Yantai. (Zu)

### Foreign Cotton Declines, Cloth Exports Increase

New York cotton market: Due to a poor weather report, but offset by profit-taking by bulls and political news from Crete favorable to bears, the closing price was down 5 to 14 points from the previous day.

Bombay cotton market: Initially, prices rose due to short covering in July and August, then softened slightly due to profit-taking by bulls, and finally rose again due to short covering. At the close, except for White Loch, which rose 12 rupees in the near term, the remaining gains and losses were 1 to 2 rupees. Furthermore, today's opening price forecast was not reached.

Fifteen pieces of Shanghai poplin were shipped to Hong Kong, another 154 pieces to Singapore, and another 288 pieces to Xiaoluzong (Philippines). Forty pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, another 40 pieces to Singapore, and 75 pieces to Xiaoluzong.

### Sugar, Beans, and Tea Exports and Imports

The day before yesterday (the 29th), 1,260 bags of foreign sugar were imported from Hong Kong. On the 30th, 100 bags of beans were exported to Hong Kong, and another 300 bags to Xiaoluzong. 183 pieces of tea leaves were shipped to Singapore, and another 100 pieces to Tianjin.

### Hardware Industry Safely Passes Dragon Boat Festival, Prices of All Goods Relatively Firm and High

The hardware industry safely passed the Dragon Boat Festival yesterday. With the supply routes from Hong Kong reportedly cut off, the source of goods has been interrupted. The prices of various goods, which were in a weak state, have become firm and high again. The morale in the industry has also risen accordingly. The prices of various items are unusually firm and high. Several types are described below:

American Narrow Strip Iron: The amount of goods circulating in the market is scarce, and the overseas supply has recently been cut off again. Hoarders and users are eagerly searching for it, so the available goods are even more insufficient. The market supply cannot meet the demand, causing the standard prices to be raised. Yesterday, the uniform color was sold for 320 yuan per box (200 pounds), and the selected color was not available for sale due to the even greater shortage of goods.

American Galvanized Iron Sheet: 26 and 28 gauge American flat galvanized iron sheets are also in short supply, and there are not many people in Shanghai who hold these goods. Therefore, the market is in good condition, and transactions are quite lively. Industry members' morale remains firm, and prices are high. Yesterday, 26 gauge was sold for 450 yuan per dan, while 28 gauge required around 500 yuan per dan, an increase of more than 1.20 yuan from before.

Straits Tinplate: The market for Straits tinplate, which has been firm for a long time, has not seen many transactions in recent days. However, due to the intentions of the holders, they are reluctant to sell easily. The total inventory in the city is only a few dozen boxes. If it is searched for, the available goods on the market will be exhausted, and the source will become a problem, causing the standard sales prices to rise again and again. Currently, 24 gauge is priced at 1,200 yuan per box, while 26 gauge requires around 900 yuan per box.

### Sericulture Miscellany

(1) The Proportion of Chinese Silk in the US Increases Significantly

In the past three years, the overall consumption of silk in the United States has been shrinking, but the proportion of Chinese silk has increased year by year. This is a welcome phenomenon due to changes in international sentiment. However, conversely, it is also a fact that the trade of British and American trading houses exporting Shanghai raw silk has declined in the past three years, while the proportion of trade of Japanese trading houses has increased. The following is a summary of the import statistics of the US raw silk market from 1938 to 1940:

Since Shanghai silk has been restricted by the "Goods Movement Ban", British and American exporters are in an even more difficult situation. Currently, those who want to export must contact the Bank of Japan for foreign exchange, so Japanese merchants have become the sole force in the export of raw silk. However, after being imported into the United States, it must be resold to the Shanghai foreign merchant agents in New York, so the problem of the opposition between Chinese and Japanese raw silk in the US market remains the same.

(2) Claws and Fangs of the Central China Company

In July 1938, the Central China Silk Association, based on 2,200 silk reeling machines from nine silk factories in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places, began to reel raw silk. It was officially announced on August 10 of the same year. It is the "centralized control agency for the Central China silk industry". The capital is 8 million yuan. The Chinese side contributed 2 million yuan in kind, and the Japanese side contributed 3 million yuan in cash. The following year, in March, the company expanded its business and increased its capital, which was still invested by the Central China Revitalization Company.

The silk business of Central China, including machine reeling, manufacturing and distributing silkworm eggs, etc., is all under the control of the Central China Company. As of April 1940, the number of silk reeling factories had increased to 21, the number of silk reeling machines had reached 7,500, the number of employees had reached more than 17,000, and the silk production had reached 38,000 dan.

Regarding seed production, it is also monopolized by them. It is estimated that in the spring of 1938, they supplied 20%, in the autumn, they supplied 75%, and after 1939, they have occupied all of it. Regarding cocoon collection, in the spring of 1939, they purchased 200,000 dan of cocoons through the original cocoon shops, using an established method to purchase from various places. In the autumn of the same year, they collected 60,000 dan of cocoons. In addition, they also purchased 86,900 dan of dried cocoons. By 1940, they had purchased a total of 130,000 dan of spring and autumn cocoons.

(3) Currency Issues and Control

More than 70% of Central China's silk has fallen into the hands of control, but the complexity of currency issues has caused distress to the control. According to the Japanese Far East Trade Monthly: "The currency problem is quite difficult. The concession and cocoon producing areas all require legal tender, but military tickets are circulating in the Japanese-occupied areas, and the currency for buying and selling is Huaxing coupons, so the operation of the Central China Silk Company is quite difficult. The Huaxing coupons originally borrowed fell with the legal tender, and as a result, a foreign exchange loss of 5.5 million yuan occurred..."

A foreign exchange loss of 5.5 million yuan cannot be said to be a small distress. Therefore, since the end of 1939, the Central China Silk Company and exporters have been pricing in US dollars, and later they have gone a step further and selling and buying in US dollars, so they say: "Therefore, the solution to today's currency problem is an urgent matter."

(4) The Mystery of Two Factions' Opinions

The shrinking of US raw silk consumption in recent years will probably shrink further with the tension of the situation. This makes the conflict between Chinese and Japanese raw silk in the United States even more intense. This stalemate has made the Japanese Silk Bureau feel anxious. Because if it is necessary to maintain the establishment of the Central China Silk Company, it must take the road of improving technology and increasing semi-production, but this will hit Japanese silk in the US market. Because of this, they have produced two factions of opinions. The first faction belongs to those who invest in the Central China Silk Company and operate exports. They all advocate that light industries such as silkworm rearing and silk production should be entrusted to Chinese regions with low production costs. Japan should specialize in heavy industry. And the other faction in the government advocates that "the first step is to correct the comprehensive dependence of the Japanese silk industry on exports. If it is necessary to shift the focus to China, then it is necessary to seek other ways to solve the problem of the export market."

However, these positive and negative opinions are, in any case, difficulties for the silk industry. What's more, the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly dangerous. As for how it will be, let us wait and see!

(5) North China is Also Promoting Sericulture

According to news from friends in Linyu County, the Linyu Xingyu Silkworm Forest Company has been actively promoting sericulture in recent years, and the promotion effect in the Linyu, Luan County, and Lulong areas is quite gratifying. Most farmers have felt interested, so the future seems to have general hope. It is recently learned that the company plans to further expand the sericulture area this year. In addition to distributing improved silkworm eggs to the counties under the jurisdiction of Jidongdao as usual, it will also establish the Xingyu Silkworm Forest Silk Factory in Beiping to provide free distribution of improved silkworm eggs. At this time of silkworm cocoon development, it is heard that 180,000 sheets of domestic and wild silkworm eggs are expected to be distributed this year.

### Economic Jottings

Price Statistics

Statistics is a field that China does not emphasize, but the facts of statistics have been scattered in various books, but they are not obvious and clear.

The most notable of what China usually calls "statistics" is accounting. What is commonly seen in account books, from a numerical point of view, includes subtotals, totals, grand totals, cumulative totals, and separate totals. From a temporal point of view, there are daily totals, monthly totals, and annual totals. As for the term "statistics," although it seems to have become an academic term today, its form has evolved from grand totals. However, the meaning of "total" only refers to the summation and conclusion of numbers. "Statistics," on the other hand, contains the meaning of unification from division, so it is close to the meaning of "Statistic."

China's statistical work consists only of customs trade books, which use the changes in the quantity and value of imports and exports, as well as the gains and losses of goods in various customs and the increase or decrease in tax revenue, as statistics. Although quantity and value are also listed separately, the so-called value is only the sum of the value of goods, not individual prices. Although it is not difficult to obtain prices from quantity and value, it is only the average price for a year, and there is no way to know its trend and changes.

China has never failed to attach importance to the investigation of commodity prices in various places. Guanzi mentioned it, and Sang Hongyang and Liu Yan implemented it. Even in the reigns of Emperor Guangxu and other emperors of the Qing Dynasty, who suffered repeated disasters, it was known that the constant prosperity of commerce required countless preparations to be effective. After the Jiawu War (1894), which ended in defeat to Japan, more and more people talked about reforms. For example, in the memorial submitted by Censor Wang Pengyun in the 21st year of Guangxu (1895), the Ministry of Revenue also knew the importance of investigating commodity prices in various places. It said:

"The Censor said that establishing commercial bureaus in various provinces to protect Chinese merchants and gradually regain economic rights is an urgent task. However, please appoint special commissioners as coordinators, but it is difficult to be thorough in an industry that is managed by officials in an official capacity. It is better for the government to establish bureaus and still allow merchants to manage them in order to connect with their feelings. It is proposed that each governor-general and governor be instructed to establish a commercial bureau in the provincial capital, and have an honest, reliable, and prestigious gentry merchant be elected by the merchants to serve as the director of the bureau and handle affairs in the bureau. The bureau should comprehensively consider the profits and losses of the province's products and prices and study them in detail. The main areas involving foreign merchants are silk and tea, and recently textiles, spinning, sugar making, and paper making, self-igniting fire (note: namely, matches) and foreign soap industries. The bureau should consider their advantages and disadvantages, which can compete with foreign merchants and which can expand sales. If they can have a real vision and a firm grasp, they should be allowed to report to the governor-general and governor to promote them. Furthermore, commercial offices should be established in various prefectures, states, and counties in water and land transport hubs, and sub-directors should be elected to connect as limbs. All information on the rise and fall of commodity prices and the growth and decline of the market in various places should be reported to the provincial bureau by the sub-directors on a quarterly basis, compiled and summarized, and the annual report should be sent to the Zongli Yamen by the governor-general and governor for reference, following the format of the General Customs Trade Report."

The General Commercial Bureau was the predecessor of the later General Chamber of Commerce, but at that time it was appointed by officials. For example, in the 25th year of Guangxu, Liu Kunyi, the governor-general of Liangjiang, sent Zhang Sai and Liu Shiheng to Shanghai to establish a bureau, but nothing was accomplished. In September of the 34th year of Guangxu, an order was issued to establish investigation bureaus in various provinces, and the various ministries and courts would compile them and establish a statistical office, but this was only a formality. After the founding of the Republic of China, statistical investigations were never failed to be carried out, but they were all practically ineffective. It was not until 1919 that China had a formal agency for investigating commodity prices, but it was still established by the customs for collecting import duties. The collection of import duties on foreign goods in China was originally the responsibility of the Guangdong Customs. Before the opening of the five ports, the annual amount was more than 899,000 taels. At that time, the level of tariffs was determined by China's own authority. However, the main imports were opium, woolen cloth, poplin, clocks, and the like, and the exports were silk, tea, rhubarb, and so on. The tax items were simple. Later, with the opening of the five ports, there were no restrictions on the import and export of foreign goods, and the goods became more and more complex, with more and more varieties. Some were not covered by the old tariff rules, so customs officials manipulated them at will, colluding with foreign merchants to embezzle profits or levying excessive taxes, insatiably greedy, which not only reduced tax revenue but also harmed merchants. After signing commercial treaties with various countries, the door to agreed tariffs was opened, so China no longer had control, and the import of foreign goods became very convenient. Foreign merchants wanted to sell their goods in China, which was beneficial to high taxes. Once the tariff was agreed with foreigners, they would choose the commodity price that was most beneficial to themselves (that is, the low price) as the basis for taxation. If so, China's tax revenue would be reduced invisibly. Therefore, the level of commodity prices often became the focus of disputes. Since China usually did not have reports on commodity price investigations, the commodity prices used were either the prices obtained by dividing the quantity and value in the customs register or temporary investigations on the market, or requests from foreign firms, all of which could not be taken as credible and were unavoidable. In 1918, when the import tariff was revised, Cai Tinggan was in charge and reported to the Ministry of Finance that it was not only inconvenient to revise the tariff without commodity price investigations at ordinary times, but also caused many losses, so there was a proposal to establish an office in Shanghai to investigate commodity prices. In January 1919, the Ministry of Finance sent Sheng Jun, Guo Sang, and Yan Jiaozhuo to establish a resident commodity price investigation office in Shanghai, and later Jia Shiyi was also sent, with Sheng Jun in charge. Sheng was a scholar, so he approached everything with a scholarly attitude. The later achievements of the commodity price investigation office were all due to his efforts.

At the beginning of its establishment, the commodity price investigation office was simple and crude. At that time, Guo Sang was the director of the Shanghai Stamp Office, and the office was located in the Sixteen Paved Streets, and the commodity price office rented the remaining rooms for office work. Later, it moved to Houzai Lane on Baker Road, and then to the sixth floor of the Poplin Exchange, until it moved into the second floor of the Jianghai Customs House, which was already after being reorganized into the National Tariff Commission.

At that time, the industrial and commercial circles not only did not support the Ministry's dispatch of commodity price investigations, but also had covert discrimination. On the surface, they reluctantly perfunctory, but secretly they put it out of their minds. They thought that government offices did things without beginning or end, and that they could get away with it as long as they prevaricated. Moreover, the investigation of commodity prices must be for the purpose of increasing taxes. If the details of our business community are known, what business can still be done? Therefore, concealment and deception were the best policies. However, only Xiang Songmao of the Wuzhou Pharmacy and Gu Zipan of the Poplin Industry knew the importance of investigating commodity prices and wholeheartedly supported it!

However, with the assistance of only one or two people and the investigation of three or four people for thousands of commodities, it can be known that it is not only simple and crude, but also laborious and ineffective. Therefore, in addition to the Ministry-appointed staff, Pan Zhongjia and Guo Nan were added to take charge of the investigation. People from the industry were recruited to report market prices, and they were called investigators. At that time, although the investigators were from various industries, they did not dare to publicly take the job, fearing that they would be blamed by the people in the store. The accumulated habits of the industrial and commercial circles were still deep, and they did not want to disclose the size of the market, fearing that once it was revealed, it would be detrimental to their "monopoly" or various "manipulations."

The employees in the industrial and commercial circles in 1919 and 1920 were not as educated as the current young employees (it should be known that reading does not necessarily make you rich, and getting rich does not necessarily require reading, which was even more true in the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles twenty years ago), and when it came to writing market reports, they felt a great burden. Therefore, the achievements of each industry investigator at that time were mostly achieved after a considerable period of training. (To be continued)

### The Trap

— Xiao Yun

This European war is related to the life and death of England and Germany, so both sides are full of tricks and compete for novelty. One of the methods is to set up "traps" before retreating from a place, so that the enemy will be greatly deceived.

For example, there is a house that is undamaged, and a basin of water is placed in the middle of the path in the garden. You lift the basin of water, and with a rumble, a landmine explodes; a picture frame on the wall of a house is hanging crookedly. You walk up and straighten it, and there is another rumble; you turn on the radio, sit in a chair, light a stove, close the window... No matter what you do, there is a danger of being greatly deceived by the enemy. Sometimes even the fresh and lovely apples growing on the trees are one of the "traps" set up by the enemy, because the apples contain poisonous juice.

In fact, is it only the military's expedition that is full of traps? Isn't the rugged world also like this? Especially in this brightly lit, extravagant city of Hua Du, traps are everywhere. Young people on the road of life must be cautious.

### Plants' Land Expansion Strategy

— Jian Nong

We know that "propagation" is a principle in the biological world that is more important than "maintaining one's own life." However, there is an accompanying prerequisite for plants: that is, do not gather the seeds together, so that they are crowded and lack the necessary nutrients to develop fully. So they must be scattered, they must use aggressive means to expand their territory! Now let's take a look at the various land expansion tactics that nature has given to plants.

Airborne

Among tactics, there is nothing more powerful and effective than the air force, and the land expansion capabilities that nature has given to plant seeds are also most numerous with airborne weapons. Look at the thin wings of elm and ailanthus coins, the round umbrellas of dandelion scissors, the swaying of poplar flowers in the wind, the soaring of willow catkins, and many other things that cannot be enumerated: whether they are airplanes or parachutes, which one is not a heroic and outstanding air fighter that is invincible?

Seafaring

Some plant seeds are surrounded by a layer of shell, and they themselves are like a small boat or submarine, so they can drift with the waves and "ride the long wind to break through thousands of miles of waves!" Someone picked up a coconut weighing 25 kilograms on the beach of the South Pacific Islands. After investigation, it was known that it had floated from an island northeast of Madagascar, Africa. Some people have calculated that a current rushing from the Isthmus of Panama to the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean carries 144 plant species from the mainland. All the islands in the ocean that have never been reached by humans since ancient times can also have plant reproduction, probably all from this.

Machine Gun

A peculiar cucurbitaceous plant that grows along the Mediterranean coast and northern Africa is called "squirt cucumber". When its fruit matures, it automatically separates from the fruit stalk (exactly what the ancient saying calls "when the melon is ripe, the stem falls off"), and because of a kind of irresistible high pressure hidden in itself, it can shoot seeds from the "stalk hole" to a very distant place. Isn't this a vivid machine gun?

Bomb

There are also familiar impatiens plants whose fruits can explode like "bombs". The fruit of impatiens is oblong. When it matures, the pericarp splits into five lobes, and the sudden coiling ejects the seeds in all directions. Europeans call this flower "touch-me-not" or "impatient flower," which can greatly express its bomb-like temper!

Strafing

The fruit of the poppy is like a small pot with a lid. When the seeds mature, a row of evenly arranged round holes opens around the lid; when the wind blows, the small pot sways and scatters the seeds from the round holes in all directions. Let's reluctantly call this way of scattering seeds strafing.

Tunnel

Bamboo, sugar cane, cogongrass, horsetail grass—also known as heart-breaking grass—and countless other plants use underground roots or stems to ramble and drill everywhere. Comparing this "drilling" effort to the action of digging a tunnel is probably somewhat similar.

Enticement

All fruits that contain juice and flesh are probably not going to crack open and scatter the seeds to the outside. Nature then decorates their appearance to be very beautiful, and the juice is made to be very sweet, so that people and animals see them and want to admire them, move their fingers, and eat them. As for the seeds, they are deliberately made bitter, astringent, and hard, making them inedible, so that people and animals will throw them away without saying a word, and turn their heads and ignore them. However, the plant's desire to expand its territory is completely satisfied by this taking and abandoning. This is called "enticement," and why not?

Rogue

A kind of noxious weed that grows in mountain gullies and by the roadside is called "cleavers". Its fruits have countless small hooks; another kind of noxious weed is called "field hedgehog", its fruits are oval and surrounded by sharp thorns, as if they are hedgehogs. When people and animals walk by them, these things can cling to people's clothes or animal fur and tails, forcing people and animals to do their duty as pioneers of land expansion. This kind of oil-rubbing method of completing the invasion is nameless, so it is called "rogue".

### A Study of Wolf Girls

— Herb Name

In 1920, a missionary named Mr. Singh, in Midnapore, India, rescued two human girls from a wolf den. They had lived with wolves for so long that they were accustomed to a savage, beastly life, making it difficult to restore their normal humanity. Mr. Singh used his best efforts to "tame" and "civilize" them, but his efforts were not entirely successful. The younger one, named Amala, died soon after; the older one, Kamala, managed to live in a human environment for nine years, but in the end, she only learned to say fifty words, liked to wear red clothes, and could play with other children, but she was still far from the standard of a normal person.

This strange story aroused the curiosity of scientists. Professor Singh, an anthropologist at Denver University, believed that this was an excellent experiment to study the influence of environment on psychological development. He collected all kinds of facts about the wolf girls from Mr. Singh, analyzed and organized them thoroughly, and recently compiled them into a book. Some passages in the book are thought-provoking, and excerpts are as follows:

"Although an infant inherits complete humanity genetically, because the human nervous system is too complex, his early years must have multifaceted contact with the human environment; otherwise, he cannot develop a healthy mind."

"The character and habits learned by an infant in the first two years have a great impact, almost equal to what is learned in the rest of his life. Therefore, if there is no contact with humans in the first two years, his language skills and upright posture will not be easily restored."

"The influence of the environment is not all-encompassing. If a young wolf or ape is brought to an orphanage to live with humans, they will not learn much about human behavior due to their innate inferiority."

### Looking in the Mirror

— Hui Ru

On average, ordinary women spend ten months of their lives looking in the mirror.

From the ages of six to ten, they spend an average of seven minutes a day looking in the mirror.

From the ages of ten to fifteen, they spend fifteen minutes!

By the age of twenty, the average is more than one hour per day.

After the age of sixty, it returns to ten minutes a day. (Parade, March issue)

(8) Palpable Friendship

"Ah! This trouble is quite a big one! Zhao called for Yu Kun, then grabbed his sleeve with a pair of hands, one short and one fat, looking like two halves of a cactus, and went straight into Begonia's bedroom. I don't know what happened to the Third Boss in Tianjin, those bastards dared to steal all his banknotes, passbooks and several boxes of top-quality goods, at least seven or eight out of ten..."

No matter how much Yu Kun liked to joke and laugh, he couldn't help but change his face suddenly when he heard Zhao Si's report, and couldn't say anything.

"How did they know?" He groaned for a while before asking Zhao Si this question.

Because Zhao Si was too fat, he kept fanning himself all the way, but the sweat on his face and body still bubbled out like the Pearl Spring.

"This is all the trickery of that kid Ji Zhaoxiong!"

Yu Kun glanced at him, not quite understanding.

"Let me tell you slowly!" Zhao Si first used a towel soaked in cold water to wipe his face vigorously, and then said breathlessly: "On the evening of the seventh day of the lunar month, Ji Zhaoxiong, who had always been a groom in Yuan Gongguan in Tianjin, suddenly broke into here alone, first rambling with us for a while, and then took Rong Kui out to talk to him alone; the next day, Rong Kui and Jin Da Gezi discussed secretly for most of the day. I happened to go out for a while, and didn't pay much attention when I came back. Unexpectedly, they had long been ill-intentioned, and a few people didn't know how much money they pooled together, bought a lot of wine and things that I usually like to eat; Second Boss, this is indeed my Zhao Si's shortcoming, I love to eat and drink all my life...!" His round, fat face immediately revealed a very ashamed expression, fully expressing the meaning of taking the blame and blaming himself. (120)

### Identifying Babies by Footprints

— Ke Zhong

Modern hospitals, in order to prevent misidentification of newborn babies, specially hang paper labels on the baby's arms or feet, indicating the baby's name, gender, weight, date of birth, mother's room number, etc., which is quite safe. Recently, there is another method, which is to identify babies by their footprints, which is said to be foolproof.

### A Clever Way to Test Actors

— Chen Zhongcheng

One day, Bai Leima asked Stanislavsky, a famous Soviet director, how he chose his actors. Mr. Shi picked up a pin and said, "I choose them with this." Then Mr. Shi said to Bai Leima, "Now, please go to the next room and wait a while."

Soon after Bai Leima went out, Stanislavsky opened his mouth and said, "Okay, now you can come in. Look for my pin!" He watched Bai Leima's every move with cold eyes.

At that time, Bai Leima first picked up a few glasses from the table; then rummaged through the saucers and basins, hoping to find the pin under those things. Suddenly, Bai Leima felt like there was something under the tablecloth, and sure enough, he lifted the corner of the tablecloth and immediately found the pin.

Mr. Shi clapped his hands and shouted, "Great, you are really capable!" The following is his explanation: "I can determine whether a person is a good actor from the way he looks for a pin. If he paced around the room, showing a look of helplessness, and pretended to be deeply thoughtful, and went to a few ridiculous (ostentatious) places to rummage around, then he must be a useless fellow."

### Silver Screen Briefs

— Wen

Yang Xiaozhong's new work is definitely named "Ancient Tomb Monster", which is still a horror film, and it has been decided that the original cast of "Zombie Revenge" will co-star.

The script of the comedy film "Shanghai Gold Rush", written by Han Langen and Yin Xiucen, has been reviewed and approved, and it has been decided to mobilize all the comedians Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, Hong Jingling, Zhang Zhizhi, Xu Jinwen, etc. to co-star, and the director may be Yang Xiaozhong.

Meng Xuxi suffered from periostitis, which festered severely. He was sent to the hospital for surgery and asked the company for a month's leave. Therefore, Meng Na's role as Mimi's mother in the Venus film "Tears Splashed on Flowers" will be assigned to someone else.

The four major domestic film first-run theaters simultaneously increased prices from the night show on the 27th of this month, but they did not publish a statement in advance. The new seat prices are divided into three types: one yuan and two corners, one yuan and five corners, and two yuan.

He Bin also plays two roles in "New Invisible Technique", one is an arrogant and reckless detective, and the other is a timid banker.

The famous writer Mao Dun's "Midnight", Guohua has decided to adapt it and put it on the screen, and is currently planning everything.

Guohua's new work "Cherishing Farewell" has officially started filming. The main cast has been decided to be Zhou Manhua, Bai Yun, Xu Feng, etc., and the director is Zheng Xiaoqiu.

Mrs. Fleck, the Western director of Minhua, has been pregnant for several months recently, so she has asked the company for leave to recuperate.

### Symphony of Drama and Film

— Bai Ding

The Shanghai Drama Society's current revival of "Tears Splashed on Flowers" is planned to have Xia Xia and Shen Min play the roles of Ding Xiang and Gu Xiaomei respectively, because they are also the two who performed in the film version of "Tears Splashed on Flowers". However, Shen Min needs a rest time from "Sorrowful City", and Xia Xia contracted a strange disease when filming "Tears Splashed on Flowers". She cannot eat salty things and must go to the hospital for fundamental treatment, so everyone cannot go on stage. The roles of Ding Xiang and Gu Xiaomei had to be changed to Bai Liyingzi.

Sun Jing, the director of "New Invisible Technique", will be able to complete all the filming within a week, so he has begun to write the script for the next issue. It is said that the story content depicts the prosperous scenery of Shanghai's surface, while interspersing the romance of a young couple. The tentative titles of the play are "Spring River Flower Moon Night" and "Shanghai Night" "Sleepless City", the title will be decided when filming in the future, and Li Lihua has been internally designated as the heroine in the play.

After Chen Yunshang finishes filming "Family" Wild Rose", she plans to return to her "second hometown" Hong Kong. The purpose is that when she left Hong Kong, she promised a certain film company in Hong Kong to film two films after one year. Therefore, she has to fulfill her promise. It will take about two months before she can return to Shanghai and take a vacation from the Guolian.

No matter what role he plays, he can be very suitable for his identity. Not only is he enjoying a great reputation in China, but he is also very popular among people in the United States, Russia, Japan and other countries when he travels to these countries, and is called a Doctor of Arts. Because he is getting older and his body is getting fat, he has been living in Hong Kong for a long time and has not been on stage. Recently, there has even been a rumor that he "grew a pine tree".

Chapter 1 The Sword Qi of Gongsun

Xu Jing scolded again and said she was a slut, lifted her up high, threw her in front of the bed and said, "You slut was born with licentiousness. At first, you repeatedly seduced me, but I, Xu Jing, am a great man who values ​​righteousness as much as a mountain. How can I collude with your licentiousness? After I sternly rejected you, you hated me and slandered me in front of my uncle, spitting blood on people, which is punishable. My uncle was dizzy for a while and believed your clever words and drove me away. Just think, how can I endure this grievance? I have long known the bad things you two dogs and men have done, so I came here tonight to catch you both and hand them over to my uncle to deal with, so that he can know what kind of person I, Xu Jing, am, and the ugly things in his family should be exposed and resolved." Xu Jing said these words with a serious voice and expression. He Ji was frightened and her face was as pale as earth. Hardening her scalp, she pleaded with Xu Jing, "Young Master Xu, it's all my fault. You are a generous person, please forgive me this time. If you hand us over to your uncle, will we still have a life? Young Master Xu, if you forgive us, we will never forget your great kindness." He Ji cried pitifully, full of tears, looking like a pear blossom in spring rain. Xu Jing laughed and said, "You slut, I can't forgive you. Who seduced me in the end? Or did I pick you up? I must distinguish clearly in front of my uncle. Tonight, I caught you two wild mandarin ducks. Let's see what kind of flowery words you still have to blame?" Then he tied He Ji with a belt, and connected with Sang Yiqing, just wanted to go downstairs to invite Wang Yongtai to confront everything, in order to clarify his innocence. Suddenly, he heard Wang Yongtai's coughing sound downstairs, followed by footsteps downstairs. Xu Jing couldn't help but feel a little strange, thinking that Wang Yongtai had already slept at ordinary times and didn't care about anything. Why would the old man suddenly come in the middle of the night? Did he already know about the affair between the adulterer and the adulteress? He saw that the door was closed, and quickly went over to open the door. Wang Yongtai walked into the room. Xu Jing stood respectfully on the side and called out Uncle. Wang Yongtai glanced at Xu Jing, nodded and said, "Nephew, you came just in time." He pointed to He Ji and Sang Yiqing tied on the ground and said, "Thank you, Nephew, for catching this pair of dogs and men for me." (77)
