### U.S. Secretary of State Hull Announces: Loan-Lease Scope Not Limited to Europe and Asia; Cooperation with China on a Significant Scale; Strict Prevention of Aggressors Controlling the Seas

Washington – Yesterday, the House Appropriations Committee approved the Loan-Lease Act appropriation of $7 billion, adding the comment, "In these perilous times, there can be no perfunctory measures. This sum must be the largest in peacetime history. We must undertake it, or we are no different from those who evade debt." The House began debating the bill yesterday. Simultaneously, the committee released testimonies from Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Chief of Staff Marshall. Hull stated, "Our urgent task is to prevent those attempting to conquer the world from controlling the oceans and attacking any nation in this hemisphere. In good conscience, I must declare to the American people that I have determined that our country and our hemisphere are in grave danger. We must vigorously pursue all possible national defense measures with the utmost speed." When Congressman Cannon, a Democratic representative from Michigan, asked which countries the Loan-Lease Act would apply to and whether Asian nations were included, Hull replied, "Our business deals with the whole world. We are cooperating with China on a significant scale because China is also within the scope of resisting aggressor nations." General Marshall testified: (1) 95% of the weapons manufactured in the U.S. for transfer abroad are suitable for both American and British forces. (2) The entire $7 billion can be considered for the fiscal year from July 1, 1941, to the same day in 1942. (3) The government has drafted a plan to transfer the entire overseas customs fleet to the Navy Department, but there is no intention to implement it at present. (4) The food requested by Britain includes cheese, dried eggs, dried milk, pork, and canned goods. (5) The rotating turrets on American tanks are derived from Britain. (6) The current prices of war materials are much lower than during the previous Great War. (7) The goal of American foreign policy is to ensure the safety of American interests and independence, free from any threat. Congressman Woodrum, a Democrat from Virginia, strongly urged the passage of the bill, saying that the only result of full American aid would be the collapse of dictators. (United Press, 19th)

Washington – U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that any nation resisting the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan would receive assistance under the Loan-Lease Act. Hull stated that China is also among the nations resisting aggression. Although Hull did not specify Japan, observers have noted that Hull’s words imply that Japan is one of the Axis nations and is attacking China. Secretary of War Stimson stated that the British Isles have become a crucial point upon which our nation's defense is based. Britain is planning to continue the war, aiming not only to save the British Isles but also to liberate European nations from their current subjugation and restore their free governments. Britain’s war will not end until these goals are achieved. (United Press, 19th)

House Debates Loan-Lease Funding; May Add Supplementary Clauses

Washington – As the House began debating Loan-Lease funding yesterday, it released statements made by American defense leaders during a closed congressional committee meeting last week. Defense Production Coordinator Knudsen stated that of the 764 American manufacturers currently producing or preparing to produce defense equipment, 61 are maintained by British funding. Budget Director Smith stated that Britain has placed orders in the U.S. totaling $2.7 billion, of which $1.68 billion has been paid. All items delivered to Britain have been paid for. Britain always pays 25% upfront for each order, with the remainder offset by British-held U.S. dollars. The British government does not currently have sufficient funds to cover new contracts. The $7 billion in American aid to Britain will be used to pay for British orders placed before the Loan-Lease Act was passed. At the beginning of this year, Britain held marketable securities worth $616 million and less marketable assets worth $900 million in the U.S. Britain's investments in Canada are nominally worth $2 billion and in South America worth $2.5 billion, but current market prices are lower than nominal value. Furthermore, at the beginning of this year, Britain held $292 million in gold, $54 million in official dollar deposits, and $305,000 in private bank deposits. Britain has provided capital assistance to American manufacturers totaling $171 million. Monthly war expenses for Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Britain total $175 million, with Britain paying $150 million alone. Canada will directly spend $1.4 billion on the war in this fiscal year. As the House began debating the $7 billion aid to Britain funding, the Appropriations Committee issued a warning that the funding must be passed quickly, or America’s international reputation will be affected. Therefore, the House should pass the bill immediately and only add the clause: "Any item procured under this act, if deemed necessary for American national defense, should be reserved for the U.S. government by the President’s discretion and not sent to foreign governments." This warning coincides with Prime Minister Churchill’s remarks in London regarding submarines and German activity on the American coast in the Atlantic. (Reuters, 19th)

### U.S. Conducts Naval Exercises in the Atlantic; Reports of German Submarines Heading Towards U.S. Territorial Waters Confirmed by Undersecretary Welles

Washington – The U.S. Navy Department announced last night that the Navy is conducting exercises in three areas along the Atlantic coast. The department emphasized that these exercises were planned long ago and are unrelated to reports of German submarine activity in U.S. territorial waters. The Navy Department warned merchant ships to navigate cautiously, as U.S. fleet submarines are currently conducting routine training exercises. The Navy Department stated that the submarine exercises are being held off Long Island Sound, the Florida Straits, and Cape Virginia. Meanwhile, naval sources here recalled that in 1918, German submarines operated in the waters near New York, sinking or severely damaging 100 ships, including the 13,000-ton U.S. ship San Diego and the 17,000-ton U.S. ship Minnesota. The latter struck a mine laid by a submarine. All German submarines returned home safely. German submarine activity near New York began in early June 1918, when survivors of the Haitian ship Deng reported that the ship had been sunk by a submarine. At the same time, the Gual was also sunk. As a result, the police ordered a blackout in New York and placed steel nets at the harbor entrance. Anti-aircraft guns were also prepared, fearing that enemy aircraft carriers might be accompanying the submarines. At that time, New York authorities planned to use tunnels as air raid shelters. (United Press, 19th)

Washington – Undersecretary of State Welles confirmed yesterday that British Ambassador to the U.S., Halifax, reported to the State Department that a German submarine was heading towards the North American coast.

Editorial

### Japan's Calm

The passage of the American Loan-Lease Act and President Roosevelt's important speech last Saturday are both highly significant events in American and world history. Beyond the meaning expressed in these actions or attitudes themselves, there is another even more important point: democracies today are no longer content with defending their own walls, but are taking the initiative by acting before aggressor nations can launch their offensives. In fact, in the European and African theaters, Britain, in addition to its existing active military operations along the Mediterranean, is focusing on defeating the weaker links in the Axis front as quickly as possible. In the Far East, China has long been preparing for a comprehensive counteroffensive. America's recent actions have all formed timely driving forces. In this respect, the aggressor front is clearly falling behind.

After this clear stance by the United States was revealed, every corner of the world has expressed a strong reaction. Democracies, whether fighting against aggression or still in a neutral position, have unanimously expressed their satisfaction. Among the aggressor nations, while resentment is the same, there are clear differences in degree. According to recent news, the Nazi side has not only used vile terms to attack, and rumors have emerged of a plan to sever diplomatic relations with the U.S. The confirmed movement of German submarines into U.S. territorial waters could potentially create a re-enactment of the Lusitania incident (which was the trigger for the U.S. entry into the previous war). In Japan, the attitude is far less agitated than that of the Nazis. The authorities have expressed calmness, saying that the U.S. President's speech contains no new elements. These differing reactions are not merely different expressions of surface attitude. They are not just because the status of the allies is different, or because American aid to Britain, Greece, and China has a different sense of urgency.

Comparing the situations in Europe and the Far East, although the Pacific involves only China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Japan, unlike Europe, which has many fronts and several non-belligerent nations mixed in with subtle nuances, there are also certain unique factors that cannot be compared to the mainland. First, Germany's wartime international relations have long been established. Since the start of the war, other than continuing to expand its sphere of influence, there have been few new changes. Its relationship with the U.S. has long become a disguised severance, with a lack of normal diplomatic and economic relations. As for the Far East, Japan, not long ago, had not yet given up its illusions about the United States and continued to perform diplomatic charades. Even though commercial relations between the two sides have been tenuously maintained in an unconditional form, Japan continues to economically depend on the U.S. In recent times, although the Japanese authorities have been touting self-sufficiency and the establishment of a highly defensible nation, the actual results remain a mystery. Therefore, even today, Japan cannot but consider the possibility of further economic sanctions by the United States. Second, before the U.S. directly participates in the war, everything done against Germany, other than embargoes and blockades, can only be carried out through warring nations such as Britain and Greece as intermediaries. Direct contact between the two sides is temporarily unimaginable. In the Far East, while China has the same function as Britain and Greece in Europe, the United States itself has taken resolute measures to respond. From the passage of the large naval bill and the division of the Pacific Fleet, to the increased defenses of Guam, the Philippines, and the Aleutian Islands, and the recent joint defense by the U.S. and Britain in the South Pacific, and the recent visit by U.S. ships from Hawaii to New Zealand, all directly project the power of the U.S. onto Japan. Third, Hitler's work of managing the European continent and consolidating the rear is almost complete, and most of it is beyond Britain's reach. The final decisive battle between the two countries is clearly a different matter. However, the "Co-Prosperity Sphere" and "Cooperative Body" proposed by Japan in the Far East are still in progress, with few significant results. The implementation of this plan is also the key to the intermittent US-Japan relationship. At the same time, Japan's management of the Asian continent is clearly inseparable from the ongoing Sino-Japanese War. Fourth, the Loan-Lease Act itself is temporarily focused on aiding Britain and Greece, making it the most painful thing for the Nazis. Japan may not be happy to hear of President Roosevelt's clear expression of aid to China, but Japan today stands at the crossroads of invading China and advancing south. Some people within the country are advocating that it may be possible to abandon the invasion of China in order to advance south. Furthermore, as the Sino-Japanese War has reached this point, Japan certainly has some sense that the situation is no longer worthwhile. Looking at their intentions, wouldn't they think that even if China had sufficient war equipment to engage in a full-scale counter-offensive, as long as the democracies' fleet in the Pacific did not take decisive action, at most it would only be a matter of the Japanese army withdrawing from the Chinese battlefield? This would not impede its freedom of action at sea. Fifth, regarding the European war, the U.S. almost completely linked Britain's gains and losses to its own safety. In the Far East, compared to Britain, the U.S. has a slightly smaller stake in the Sino-Japanese War and a slightly more distant sense of safety. Because it is lighter and farther, it has been overlooked and disregarded by some Americans, and it is also the source of some of the earlier illusions that Japanese authorities had about the U.S. The above-mentioned factors, on the one hand, will make Japan aware of the seriousness of its future prospects and not dare to act rashly. On the other hand, they also indicate that Japan still needs to and may be able to delay its existing relationship with the U.S. for some time, to wait quietly for new factors and new changes in the future, with Matsuoka's visit to Europe and the imminent Anglo-German war being the main objects of its expectation.

In any case, America's recent measures and the display of its greatest resolve have already given it an advantage in the long-distance race between the democracies and the aggressor front. Regardless of how aggressors express themselves about this, it is predicted that they will not have effective countermeasures to counteract this. This will undoubtedly strengthen the courage and determination of some endangered nations, stabilize those who waver, and those who might help aggressors cannot but seriously reconsider their own steps and their consequences. The calm that Japan is desperately trying to show on the surface will inevitably be unable to completely conceal its inner pain and anxiety. The paths it can choose afterward are narrower than before, and no matter what it is hoping for, it can be asserted that it will neither be an unparalleled arsenal nor have the hope and strength to completely defeat the democracies. Twenty months ago, Terauchi Hisaichi and Osumi Mineo, who were dispatched by Japan to visit Germany and Italy, unexpectedly encountered the Soviet-German agreement in the middle of their journey. Matsuoka's recent trip abroad has also coincided with the US expressing its strong steps and determination. This can be said to be a common misfortune for the Japanese envoys visiting Germany and Italy, and it can be regarded as a historical coincidence, but it also suggests that...

### The Central Mountain Area: Chinese Army Launches Full-Scale Counteroffensive, Recaptures Important Strongholds, Japanese Troops Flee in Defeat, Chinese Army Breaks into Caozhang Town on the Tongpu Railway Line

Xingji, the 16th. At dawn, the Chinese army in the Zhongtiao Mountain area launched a full-scale counteroffensive, first capturing the heights near Zhangma, which greatly benefited the Chinese army.

The Chinese Army Achieves Victory on the Huainan and Jinpu Railways

Lihuang. After suffering a major defeat in southern Henan, the Japanese, in an attempt to reverse their military decline, vainly hoped to consolidate their rule along the Huainan Railway line. At the beginning of this month, they began to attack the Chinese Anhui eastern positions, but were ambushed by the Chinese from different directions and suffered heavy losses. In order to understand the details of the battle results and the gains made by the Chinese side, this reporter visited a certain theater commander and asked about everything. He gave the reporter the following account: The Jinpu and Huainan Railways run through the southeast of Anhui Province, connecting Xuzhou and Bengbu in the north, and occupy a strategically important position militarily. Therefore, after the Japanese army occupied the strongholds along the two railways, they always wanted to consolidate their rule on both sides of the strongholds. Recently, the military situation in southern Henan deteriorated, and the Japanese troops attacking Womeng were once again defeated by our forces. In order to divert international attention and reverse the military decline, they gathered forces from various places at the beginning of this month, reaching 5,000 men, more than 30 artillery pieces, and a part of mercenary forces, and launched an offensive towards the umbrella-shaped area from Chuzhou, Quanjiao, Chaoxian, Hefei and other places, attempting to encircle the field troops on both sides of the Chinese railway, so as to achieve their dream of consolidating the rule of the occupied area. The Chinese side had already foreseen their plan and immediately waited in strict formation, dealing with it calmly. The Chinese army, distributed in various field units in the eastern Anhui area, waited for the Japanese troops to advance to Zhoujiagang, an area favorable to the Chinese, and then ambushed them from different directions, making use of the terrain to carry out inner-line operations, ambushing from both inside and outside, breaking through and eliminating them one by one. The battle was extremely fierce between the Chinese and Japanese. In order to achieve the predetermined strategic plan, the Chinese used powerful troops to attack the north and south sections of the Huainan Railway. At that time, the important stronghold of Dongchang on the Huainan Railway was recaptured, and at the same time, more than 20 li of railway tracks were destroyed, cutting off Japanese transportation and communication. The Japanese suffered a fierce ambush on the Chinese inner line, and transportation was cut off, causing extreme panic. On the 9th of this month, they began to collapse and retreat to the few remaining strongholds on the Huainan Railway. The Chinese army tracked and pursued them, and soon recaptured places such as Guhe. The remaining Japanese are now entrenched in the fortifications along the Huainan Railway, hiding and not daring to come out, like turtles in a jar. In total, more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, and as many as 400 bodies were burned at Liangyuan, which shows the extent of Japanese losses. The Chinese seized dozens of railway tracks, more than 300 catties of electric wire, and countless other spoils of war. Taking advantage of the victory, the Chinese army launched separate attacks and recaptured Wuwei on the 13th. The remaining Japanese withdrew from the south gate, and the Chinese are currently pursuing them. At the same time, due to the disastrous defeat of the Japanese, Japanese Colonel Fang committed suicide due to the defeat. Xiao Guolai's mercenary unit in Chaoxian County and Bai Ziming's mercenary unit in Dingyuan, both consisting of 300 men, successively surrendered. All of this is clear evidence of the Chinese victory in this battle, and from this we are even more convinced that the War of Resistance will surely be won and the nation will surely be built.

Tunxi. At 5 p.m. on the 13th, a Japanese medium-sized transport ship, fully loaded with supplies and rations, was sailing towards Shangzhou.

### Rumors of an Imminent Completion of a Sino-British Alliance

Chongqing. Well-informed sources here said today that Sino-British military cooperation in the Far East is gradually approaching a public stage. It is hinted that it is quite possible for Britain to conclude an alliance with General Chiang Kai-shek's army. If the alliance is realized, the Chinese army will support British operations in Burma and Malaya. In India, if possible, the Chinese army will also assist the British army. This cooperation is within the framework of the United States' South Pacific policy, the purpose of which is to maintain the status quo and prevent Japan from advancing south. It is pointed out that this Sino-British alliance will represent a program of British colonial policy contrary to that of the Chinese Communist Party, which believes that all colonies should be independent and autonomous. However, it is expected that the Chinese Communist Party will assist Britain. (19th International News Service dispatch)

### British Troops Continue to Arrive in Greece; German-Greek Relations Tense; Nazi Action Against Greece Unlikely Before the Attitudes of Turkey and Yugoslavia Are Clear

London – News from Germany indicates that diplomatic relations with Greece will soon be severed. A dispatch from the Turkish News Agency in Berlin states that German-Greek relations are extremely tense. According to official sources in Berlin, the relationship between the two countries can no longer be considered normal. It is believed that the German envoy to Greece has received detailed instructions regarding this matter. The Greek envoy to Germany has not yet left his post. A Spanish newspaper dispatch from Berlin reports that it is widely rumored in Berlin that there are now 300,000 British troops in Greece. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry has declined to answer questions about Germany's intentions toward Greece. German newspapers and radio stations are currently conducting an anti-Greek campaign. Berlin views this as a sign that the German side will now handle the situation in Greece militarily. In the past few days, Italian troops have launched desperate counterattacks, suffering heavy losses. However, the German troops along the Greco-Bulgarian border have not launched an offensive against Greece, which has surprised many in London. It is believed that transportation obstacles are one reason for the inactivity of the German troops, and the resolute attitude of the Southern countries is also a very important factor. Meanwhile, a Swedish newspaper dispatch from Berlin states that Germany is currently engaged in diplomatic action aimed at obtaining a full understanding with Turkey. It is generally believed that Germany is currently hesitant and has not dared to take action against Greece, as it wants to be certain of Turkey's attitude. Responsible officials in Berlin have refused to comment on whether the reply of Turkish President İsmet İnönü to Hitler is considered satisfactory. (Reuters, 19th)

Budapest – According to news arriving here this morning, just as Greek reinforcements were rushing to the Greco-Bulgarian border, several dozen British troops entered Greece. At the same time, the Soviet Union's position in the Balkans is becoming increasingly important. It is rumored that Moscow has sent a written guarantee to Turkey stating that if Turkey is drawn into the war, the Soviet Union will remain neutral. Germany's actions in the Balkans today seem imminent. It is rumored that another 100,000 to 150,000 British troops have arrived from Cairo and landed in Greece. It is claimed that these British troops, including elite mechanized units, have mostly landed in Volos and plan to defend the second line of defense, which starts from Larissa, passes through the peaks of Mount Olympus, and extends to Florina and Prespa River on the Greco-Albanian border. News indicates that more Allied troops will arrive in the coming days. The Greek government has ordered all foreign reporters to leave Thessaloniki. (International News Agency, 19th)

Istanbul – Travelers arriving here yesterday from Greece confirmed the news of the arrival of British troops in Greece. A traveler, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that he was forced to move out of his hotel in Athens on Monday to make way for British officers. The traveler said that the British troops arrived in Volos and then moved north to Larissa on Greece's second line of defense. It is said that the majority of these Allied troops are Australians and Canadians. (Associated Press, 19th)

Yugoslavia Determined to Remain Neutral; Rejects German Request for Passage

Istanbul – British and Turkish individuals here are reportedly excited by the news of British troops entering Greece and Yugoslavia's strong resistance to Germany's request for passage. Diplomatic circles claim that Yugoslavia has been calling up people for military service, and by the end of March, Yugoslavia could have 1.25 million armed soldiers. These individuals also claim that this army may be preparing to resist German troops entering Greece via Bulgaria through the Vardar River Valley to attack Yugoslavia. It is also rumored that Yugoslav troops have been concentrated in the area from Niš to Skopje and along the border with Greece. Yugoslavia's border defenses have been under construction for three months and are now being strengthened. These defenses include sentry huts. According to Axis sources, Yugoslav politicians who recently visited Germany were forced to allow Germany to transport weapons via rail through Klagenfurt, Maribor, Belgrade, Niš, and Sofia into Bulgaria. (Associated Press, 19th)

Belgrade – The government continues to remain silent about reports that Yugoslavia is negotiating with Germany. However, well-informed sources claim that an agreement between Germany and Yugoslavia could be signed within days. It is said that the negotiations between the two countries are now focusing on the Axis alliance, with reservations favorable to Yugoslavia. It is believed that these reservations are intended to prevent Yugoslavia from being drawn into the war, so the Axis alliance's conditions do not include Germany's passage through Yugoslav territory. It is also learned that while Germany wants to keep these reservations secret, Yugoslavia wants to announce them. (Associated Press, 19th)

Athens – The local press believes that Germany's demands to Yugoslavia include allowing German goods to pass freely through Yugoslav territory to Romania, allowing Germany to establish German hospitals in Yugoslavia, granting German wounded soldiers the right to pass freely through Yugoslavia, and it can also be assumed that German arms should be allowed to pass through Yugoslav territory to Bulgaria, so that the Romanian railways can be used exclusively for troop transport. It is believed that Yugoslavia will accept these conditions. It is also reported that Yugoslavia's mobilization is continuing. Well-informed sources believe that it will be extremely difficult for Yugoslavia to maintain its integrity, and a major German-Yugoslav agreement will be signed in the near future. (Associated Press, 19th)

Turkish Authorities Engage in Diplomatic Activities; Strengthen Defenses to Cope with Events

Ankara – Last night, officials announced that Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu had left here yesterday for Adana in the south, but did not specify his mission. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)

London – It is reported that the Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union recently met with Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Civil Affairs and Foreign Commissar Molotov separately. (Reuters, 19th)

Istanbul – Evening newspapers here report that Turkey's defense expenditures over the past year and a half have amounted to 500 million Turkish pounds. Note that this figure is an estimate. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)

Ankara – Exercises by various units of the Turkish army in air defense and dealing with large-scale paratrooper invasions have been underway for several days and are now in their final stages. (Havas News Agency, 18th)

The Soviet Union Will Not Stand Idly By Regarding Developments in the Balkans

Vichy – Diplomatic figures here have recently commented that Yugoslavia's lack of urgency in stating its position can be interpreted as Germany having neither presented an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government nor exerted any pressure on Yugoslavia. A spokesman for the German government has repeatedly stated that his country regards the Balkan Peninsula as its "living space" economically, and therefore hopes that the peninsula can maintain peace. Yugoslav newspapers also state that Yugoslavia is conducting negotiations with Germany on an equal footing. However, the reason why these negotiations have been delayed and unresolved is likely due to the following three reasons: (1) The Yugoslav government, regardless of what decision it makes, must first seek the unanimous approval of the entire country; (2) Before deciding on its attitude, Yugoslavia hopes to first know the outcome of the recent fighting between Italy and Greece; (3) Yugoslavia is somewhat influenced by foreign forces, which is worth considering. For example, British Foreign Secretary Eden did not go to the Yugoslav capital after visiting Athens, but only British Ambassador to Yugoslavia Campbell flew to Athens to meet with him. This is noteworthy item one. The Soviet Union seems to have adopted an attitude of indifference towards the Balkan Peninsula issue, but Soviet Ambassador to Yugoslavia Belonogov recently returned to his country to report on his duties, and immediately returned to his post after receiving new instructions from the Soviet government. Although it is not known at this time what kind of advice the Soviet Union has given to the Yugoslav government, Ambassador Belonogov was in Moscow at the same time that the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union was conducting talks with the Soviet authorities. All of this can make the world believe that the Soviet Union is not completely indifferent to the Balkan Peninsula issue. This is noteworthy item two. (Havas News Agency, 18th)

### Italian Counteroffensive in Albania Again Defeated; British Aircraft Bombard Durazzo

London – A Reuters correspondent reports from the Albanian border that Italian troops launched a strong new offensive in the northern sector of the Albanian front yesterday, but were again defeated and suffered heavy losses. Before the Italian counteroffensive, their artillery had carried out heavy shelling, and the fighting in the Tepelenë area was particularly fierce. There is a risk that a large Italian force in the area may be surrounded. Air activity has also increased, with the British and Greek air forces actively assisting the ground forces. It is said here that the Italian troops clearly want to break through the Greek lines on the 30-kilometer front near Tepelenë, or will redeploy sufficient troops to Tepelenë for another counteroffensive. There is currently no reason to believe that the Italian defeat will accelerate German aid to Italy. According to Greek radio, the Italian counteroffensive ended in defeat after seven days and is now much less active. The radio station also broadcasted a Greek official report last night stating that Greek patrols were very active. According to reliable sources, the Italian troops are attempting to reorganize their remnants, but the enemy army may not risk launching another attack after the reorganization. (Reuters, 19th)

Athens – British aircraft, under intense anti-aircraft fire, bombed Durazzo, an important Italian base in Albania, causing violent explosions and large fires. Another squadron of British aircraft attacked an Italian convoy on the Tepelenë-North Gravos-Buzi road, and all British aircraft returned safely to base. (Reuters, 19th)

### Turkish President's Reply Delivered to Berlin

Berlin – A German Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed today that Turkish President İsmet İnönü has replied to a letter from Hitler. The Turkish President's reply has been delivered to Berlin, but its content and the state of German-Turkish relations cannot be explained. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)

### International Anecdotes (10): The Third Term of the American President, Roosevelt's Daily Life

President Roosevelt had breakfast in bed at nine o'clock every morning, and his day of official business began from then on. The first to enter his bedroom were General Watson, the Secretary of State (in charge of the President's meetings), Miss LeHand, and Dr. McIntyre. When General Watson met the President, he didn't talk about official business, but started with a joke. Dr. McIntyre was an old friend of his, and every morning he would greet him and ask if he had slept well the night before and how he felt. Nine out of ten days, the President would say that he felt very comfortable.

After the usual morning greetings, "Old Joe" General Watson would present the day's list of visitors. The President would mark them one by one with a pen, with some visitors being received by him personally, some being seen by Secretary Early, or some being talked to by other officials. General Watson would always list those who had come from afar to meet the President at the top of the list, so that the President could make a decision first. Sometimes Roosevelt would instruct General Watson to add one or two more guests to the end of the list, which was truly like "knocking on the city gate," so to speak, a lucky thing. On Monday mornings, the list that General Watson opened up always had around fifty people, and not a few were eliminated. From this, it can be seen that the President, just in terms of meeting guests, was already busy enough.

At noon, Roosevelt would have his meal in the office, with various dishes delivered to him in a specially made insulated box with four wheels. Lunch would probably consist of a clear soup, an egg dish, a cheese cake, or lettuce. He did not eat sweets during the day, drank coffee for breakfast, tea after lunch, and a non-stimulating "Sanka" coffee in the evening.

In the afternoon, in addition to meeting guests, he also had to attend meetings, such as the weekly press conference on Tuesdays, the National Defense Committee meeting on Thursdays, and the Cabinet meeting on Fridays. As for talking with foreign envoys and receiving cabinet members, that was "commonplace." Recently, as international conditions have become more treacherous, meetings on defense and diplomatic issues have often made him feel overwhelmed, so he was often late for various meetings. For example, whenever he entertained reporters, he had no way to arrive on time. At a year-end conversation meeting in late December last year, he told reporters that in the new year of 1941, he would find a way to make up his mind and no longer make the mistake of being late, but he also said that although that was the case, he could not guarantee it.

Although Roosevelt was very busy with official business every day, he was still tirelessly hospitable, so time felt even more scarce. Some people described the President as being locked next to his desk, that he had the desire to see guests off, but not the strength to do so, but this was just an unreliable joke. In reality, General Watson often signaled to the President at an opportune time, asking him to dismiss the guests. Since the President was hospitable and loved to talk, if it were left to him alone, there would be no way to receive seven or eight guests in the entire morning. For the past eight years, Roosevelt has been energetic and hospitable as his life in the White House, truly worthy of being called a gifted person.

From 5:30 PM to 9:00 PM was Roosevelt's most leisurely time of day. He would take a short nap after a massage. Before dinner, if he was in the mood, he would personally mix "cocktails" to entertain guests. On the desk full of trinkets, there were many glasses and bottles, and he enjoyed mixing and stirring them. Dinner was a large meal, with soup, fish, meat, lettuce, and desserts. Roosevelt did not have much of a sweet tooth and often replaced them with cheese. Among all kinds of food, he had a special fondness for wild game and turtles, and received many gifts from all sides.

President Roosevelt liked to wear gray or blue suits during the day, and dark clothes, black ties, and soft shirts in the evening. Sometimes he would put on a black velvet jacket on the outside.

During his time living in Washington D.C., President Roosevelt rarely had the opportunity to leave the White House, except for traveling. He most liked to take the "Potomac" yacht out for a cruise on the weekends, or return to his home in Hyde Park, or take a vacation at Warm Springs, and occasionally take a cruise on a warship. He had a special interest in traveling, especially his love of yachting. During his first term as President, he converted a Coast Guard cutter, the "Electra," into the "Potomac," and every Saturday he would always take this yacht up the Potomac River, regarding it as his only pleasure.

The yacht was specially equipped with an elevator, which Roosevelt used as transportation when he went from the cabin to the deck to sunbathe. Whenever he went out for a cruise, he was always accompanied by four or five close friends. Everything was unrestrained and comfortable on the ship. Sometimes he would sleep in his bunk all day, reading books and newspapers, or playing with stamps. Sometimes he would enjoy fishing on the deck. He liked to fish for eels, thinking that they had an excellent flavor, not inferior to chicken. On Sunday mornings, naval aircraft would deliver all the mail and newspapers from the air to the yacht. The "Potomac" was often followed by the "Courier," which carried many secret service agents. When there was an emergency, the President would leave the "Potomac" yacht and board the "Courier" speedboat, which would go directly to the nearest pier, where he would transfer to a car and return to the capital.

On the surface, the yacht was only carrying President Roosevelt around for rest, and did not discuss national affairs on the ship, but according to unofficial sources, the decision of the United States to supply destroyers to Britain may have been made during one of these voyages.

If Roosevelt returned to his home in Hyde Park on the weekends, he always departed on Thursday evenings. Nowadays, because he is busy with official business, he rarely leaves the White House before Friday. He travels in a special train, which has a total of eight cars. The last car is a "Pullman" parlor car, where Roosevelt eats and sleeps. Counting backwards, the second car carries secretaries, stenographers, and guests. The third car is used entirely by secret service agents, who number eighteen. The fourth car is a dining car for the staff, and the two cars in front of it are used exclusively by reporters, photographers, film news photographers, technicians, postal workers, and railway employees. The seventh car in front has bunk beds for the staff and other secret service agents to ride in. The car immediately behind the train engine is half a club and half a luggage compartment. There are two white flags covering the front of the train. After departing from Washington, it rarely stops along the way except to inspect the axles. In the past, there was a lead car in front of the President's train, but now the special train often leaves after the ordinary passenger car has departed, and there is no need for an escort car. The railway companies, in order to show respect to the President, offer "cheap fares," offering a discount on ordinary car prices, and only charging some extra travel expenses for "Pullman" cars.

President Roosevelt himself rarely has the opportunity to come into contact with money. The only time he comes into contact with money is when he occasionally enjoys playing poker or bridge. The state provides him with a total of 30,000 US dollars per year for travel and official banquets, plus a bi-monthly salary check of 1,125 US dollars. After he receives these checks, he signs them on the back and gives them to Miss LeHand. She then gives them to a White House messenger, who deposits them in Riggs National Bank across the street from the White House. Roosevelt has been doing business with this bank for many years.

### British Troops Victoriously Advance Closer to the Heart of Italian East Africa; Capture Jijiga, Not Far from the Ethiopian Capital; The Fortress of Keren Is Surrounded and in Dire Straits

Nairobi – British Imperial troops are now gradually advancing closer to Addis Ababa (the Ethiopian capital), the heart of Mussolini's East African empire. Today's bulletin stated that the South African Air Force bombed the airport at Wajir, 120 miles east of the Ethiopian capital, on Sunday. On the same day, a train heading to Wajir was strafed by British aircraft and forced to stop. (Reuters, 19th)

Nairobi – It was announced here today that Jijiga in Ethiopia has been captured by British troops. The town is located 90 kilometers east of Harar and 900 kilometers from Mogadishu, the capital of Italian Somaliland. This important city is on the retreat route of Italian troops withdrawing from Babile and is only 250 miles (400 kilometers) from the Ethiopian capital. (Reuters, 19th)

London – There is continued fierce fighting in the Keren area. Italian troops have launched repeated counterattacks, but have been severely defeated. In British Somaliland, British vehicles have been consolidating their positions since the capture of Babile. Within Ethiopia, British troops and Ethiopian patriotic forces are now pressing forward from all directions. The British advance from Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia is continuing. (Reuters, 19th)

London – According to reports from both British and Italian sources over the past 24 hours, the city of Keren, upon which the fate of Eritrea, and even the entire Italian East Africa, hinges, is now increasingly in dire straits. To the north, British and French troops are currently traversing desolate mountains and advancing along the road to Keren. Some heights along the road, which are very suitable for defense, are still held by Italian troops. British troops have had to attack Italian positions that have been defended for months, and because the Italian troops number up to 30,000, which is more than the British troops, it is expected that the Battle of Keren will continue for several days. The Cairo military communique and the Italian communique from Rome both describe fierce Italian counterattacks against the British troops surrounding Keren, with heavy losses. A British Army communique released in Cairo states that British troops and patriotic Ethiopian troops within Ethiopia are continuing to exert pressure on the retreating Italian troops over a wide area, while British troops within British Somaliland are expanding their conquered territory. British troops in East Africa are currently clearing out the remaining enemy forces, and the number of captured enemy soldiers and war booty is increasing daily. (Reuters, 19th)

London – Newspapers carry articles by military commentators stating that Italian troops within British Somaliland are currently being attacked by British troops from two sides and are unable to escape. One South African force, attacking north into Ethiopia, is currently approaching Jijiga, cutting off the road from Babile (the capital of British Somaliland), which was captured on Sunday, to Addis Ababa. Italian troops, who have recently withdrawn from Babile, may be forced to surrender or will have to flee into French Somaliland and be detained. Also, yesterday, British aircraft soared over the skies of Africa, bombing and strafing Italian positions, convoys, and troops. A recent communique from the British Middle East Air Force Command summarizes the British Air Force's battle situation as follows: In Eritrea, there was continued British air activity in the Keren area yesterday. Enemy troops and artillery on Mount Chelbred were subjected to dive bombing and strafing. The railway to the southeast was also attacked, and one Italian aircraft was shot down. In Ethiopia, enemy troops and transport vehicles in the Harar-Jijiga area were strafed by the South African Air Force. It was also learned that on March 13th and 15th, Italian aircraft engaged in combat with South African aircraft at Dagahbur and Diredawa, and four were confirmed destroyed. In Libya, on the night of the 16th, the British Air Force launched a heavy attack on the port of Tripoli, and bombs hit and set fire to ships, docks, hangars, and military depots. Explosions also occurred near railway storage areas and radio stations. (Reuters, 19th)

### Hunan Provincial Administrative Conference Approves the Promotion of the "Teach Three" Movement; Textbooks Will Be Printed Soon; Focus on Popularizing Education for Illiterate People

(Leiyang Correspondence) The textbooks for the "Teach Three" Movement in Hunan Province have been contracted for printing through bidding by the Department of Education. They will be printed and distributed to all counties in the province soon, and teaching will begin. As the movement is about to be launched, the reporter has compiled and recorded the provisional measures for promoting the "Teach Three" Movement approved by the Hunan Provincial Administrative Conference as follows:

(1) In order to gather collective wisdom and effort in this province to popularize remedial education for illiterate people and instill the necessary knowledge for resisting aggression and building the nation, these measures are formulated based on the plan for promoting the "Teach Three" Movement passed by the Provincial Administrative Conference.

(2) The educational administrative authorities of each county must, in accordance with these measures, recruit intellectuals to effectively promote the "Teach Three" Movement. In addition to maintaining close contact with the local garrison and various institutions, they must also instruct each Bao chief to cooperate with the local school principal or gentry to handle it.

(3) The term "intellectuals" in these measures, in addition to teachers and staff of schools at all levels, staff of social education institutions, and students of secondary schools and above who are already serving as prescribed social education workers, refers to civil servants of various institutions, staff of various cultural and industrial organizations, and other personnel who are at least sixteen years old and have received education of at least the fourth grade of elementary school.

(4) The Social Education Promotion Committee of each county should make every effort to assist in the promotion of the "Teach Three" Movement and list it as one of the central tasks of the committee this year.

(5) Each Bao chief, from the date of receiving the order to promote the movement, should, within half a month, prepare a clear list of the intellectuals recruited in the Bao and the three illiterate people they are responsible for teaching, including their names, genders, ages, and addresses, and submit it through the township head to the educational administrative authorities of the county for record.

(6) The recruitment affairs of various institutions and organizations shall be the responsibility of the persons in charge of the respective institutions and organizations, and a clear list shall be prepared and submitted to the educational administrative authorities of each county for record.

(7) Upon receiving the above list, the educational administrative authorities of each county shall immediately find ways to issue textbooks for public schools (Common Knowledge of the National Language) according to the number of students taught in each Bao or institution, divided into types A, B, and C. Type A consists of four volumes, with a teaching completion period of four months. Type B consists of two volumes, with a completion period of two months. However, if the textbooks are not easy to distribute at the time, the intellectuals should copy and teach them, or temporarily use enlarged miscellaneous characters to replace the teaching books.

(8) Upon reaching the completion period, a request should be made to the educational administrative authorities of each county to send personnel to test. If all can recognize the shapes of the characters and understand their meanings, the obligation is considered fulfilled. However, the educated person should still fulfill the obligation of "knowing and transmitting," and each person must transfer the teaching to three illiterate people, and so on. The educational administrative authorities of each county must also issue textbooks according to the names of the illiterate people taught as reported, so as to facilitate travel teaching.

(9) Intellectuals who are responsible for promoting the "Teach Three" Movement and have achieved real results may be rewarded by the educational administrative authorities of each county and notified to the original service unit as one of the considerations for performance evaluation. The rewards are divided into commendations and the issuance of certificates of merit.

(10) If the educated people have exceeded the completion period and have fulfilled the obligation of transferring education and the results are indeed excellent, the reward measures shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 9 of these measures.

(11) If the educated people have completed the term and the test results meet the provisions of Article 8 of these measures, their treatment shall be the same as that of public school students who have completed their studies and whose examination results are passing. The educational administrative authorities of each county may also issue certificates of academic achievement.

(12) The names, genders, ages, original service units of the intellectuals recruited each year, and the names, genders, ages, addresses, completion periods, and test results of the illiterate people taught shall be reported by the educational administrative authorities of each county to the Department of Education for record.

(13) These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Hunan Provincial Government Committee.

(7) The champions of each group in this year's league are as follows:

### Tung Wah Issues a Seven-Point Statement; Lists Judicial Bias and Responsibility Issues, etc.

Li Shijun, honorary secretary of the Tung Wah Football Club, made a statement yesterday regarding the unfortunate incident in the Yiyuan match. As various Western newspapers have made many slanders against Tung Wah, he specially put forward seven points to clarify the situation at the time and the issue of responsibility. The details are as follows: (1) The first goal scored by Tung Wah that was ruled invalid was scored by Jia Youliang. At that time, Dai Linjing was near the goal and did not compete with the Western District Police goalkeeper Boerping for the ball. (At that time, Kanaal pointed out that Dai had committed a foul by bumping into Boer.) The Tung Wah players initially thought that Dai was offside, which resulted in the award of a free kick. Only later did they realize that it was a personal foul, which was actually unfounded. (2) Tung Wah left the field because Huang Kehou and Boerping collided with each other. Prior to this, Western District Police center forward Willie Hauer had also violently bumped into Qin Bigao, causing Qin to almost fall to the ground. (This matter was witnessed by Chinese and Westerners in the field.) Kanaal only awarded a free kick. Why did Huang's foul receive a warning in addition to the penalty kick? It is obvious that the referee was unfair. (3) After Huang was warned, Dai stepped forward and said to Kanaal, "Such a common foul situation is given a warning, and the goal that has already been scored can be considered not scored. I don't know how to play." Upon hearing this, Kanaal ordered Dai to leave the field. As for the claim in the Continental Daily that Dai insulted and scolded Kanaal, it is absolutely not true. Dai has been playing football for more than ten years and has a general demeanor on the field. He has never been rude or behaved rudely, which is well known to Chinese and foreigners. Why did this competition deviate from the norm of the past ten years and insult the referee? It can be seen that what the Continental Daily claims is unreasonable in terms of both emotion and reason. (4) This A group final was an extremely important event. The Western League should have sent an extremely fair and neutral person as the referee. For example, in the international matches between China and England, Germans were used as referees and Italians as linesmen, which was very appropriate. However, this time, Kanaal, who is related to the Western District Police (Kanaal is a [blank] and works as a secretary in the Fire Brigade), was used as the referee. Sima Zhao's intentions are well known to everyone. (5) Some Western newspapers have attributed the actions of the spectators overstepping the rules to Tung Wah and claimed that the incident was triggered by Tung Wah's abandonment. Tung Wah cannot admit to this at all. Tung Wah is not a professional organization. The large number of spectators and the income of tens of thousands have nothing to do with Tung Wah. If there had been only one spectator in the field at the time, Tung Wah would have left the field and stopped the continuation of the game in a situation of unbearable patience. (6) Kanaal was the goalkeeper for the Western team and has always been extremely discriminatory towards Chinese people, considering them barbaric and rude. He has long had a prejudice in his heart. How can one expect fairness from Kanaal as a referee? (7) In the previous year, during the match between West Foss and Savaia at the racecourse, there was an unfortunate incident of violence. The referee was also Kanaal. This man is good at inciting incidents. In short, Tung Wah was first subjected to unwarranted oppression and then subjected to slanderous accusations. It is particularly painful to speak of it. The above statement is made to inform people from all walks of life, and I hope they will take it into consideration.

### Paramount Basketball Team Leaves for Hong Kong Yesterday

### Once Hoarding Stops, Grain Prices Will Drop Three or Four Dollars Immediately

Yesterday, as soon as the hoarders of foreign rice eased their grip, market prices immediately fell. It is credible that the recent rise in rice prices was entirely driven by hoarding. Certain individuals, disregarding the food needs of Shanghai residents, not only blocked the flow of rice from inland areas to Shanghai but also drove up prices by buying in the market, fueling the hoarders' arrogance. In their minds, hoarding grain is a source of great profit, as secure as a golden city. In reality, it is exploitation of laborers and the common people, a sin incomparable to profits from other businesses. Most detestable are those who, while engaging in extreme greed, feign concern for the people's food supply, hoping to be remembered favorably, yet fail to consider the harm they inflict, leaving a legacy of infamy that will last for generations. This is far more dangerous than catching centipedes under a tiger's head. Furthermore, there are new hoarders who, driven by envy, blindly buy, driving prices ever higher, often creating unprecedented levels. Genuine merchants must still calculate costs and other factors. If the large quantities of rice stored in the city, held by these hoarders, were allowed to circulate, market prices could easily be stabilized. Because the hoarding slightly diminished, prices at the origin became higher, and they gradually declined. Transactions were scarce, and the black market prices for all types of foreign rice fell by three or four dollars. Small machine-milled rice initially cost 4,200 to 4,300 dollars, but now trades at 4,100 dollars, even as low as 4,000 dollars. Number Two Saigon is at 3,700 to 3,800 dollars. Number One Saigon, Siam, and fire-milled rice have fallen from 3,600 to 3,700 dollars to 3,300 to 3,400 dollars. Rice bran has fallen from 3,000 dollars to 2,700 to 2,800 dollars. Broken rice has fallen from 2,400 to 2,500 dollars to as low as 1,600 dollars, and so on.

Domestic rice like thick and thin japonica suddenly saw robust arrivals, coupled with falling black market prices for foreign rice. Both buyers and sellers became more cautious, so as sellers loosened their grip on slow moving inventory, thick japonica prices softened by one dollar per shi (unit of dry measure), regular Jiangsu rice traded at 107 to 105 dollars per hu (unit of dry measure), Kunshan rice ranged from high of 104 dollars to about 100 dollars, original price was around 105 dollars and as thin indica is more digestible, it suddenly dropped by two or three dollars, regular Qingjiao traded at 116 to 115 dollars per hu, original bag price was 102 dollars.

With glutinous rice mirroring the fatigue of other commodities, trading became even more scarce. However, holders, believing that supplies were not abundant, were unwilling to sell cheaply, so prices, though declining, did so only slightly. Hong Kong white glutinous rice fell from 106 or 107 dollars to 103 or 104 dollars, glutinous tea rice from 96 or 97 dollars to 94 or 95 dollars.

Large quantities of foreign rice have arrived daily via the French liner. The Ding, a designated ship, arrived the day before yesterday with 10,000 bags, already reported in the newspaper. The L'Aasia arrived at the port around 8 PM the night before last and is unloading at the Huashun wharf in Hongkou. More is expected to arrive continuously in the future. (Ancestor)

### Abundant Arrivals and Inventory of Foreign Flour - Wheat Remains Stagnant

The foreign flour market continues to meander. As for sources of supply, Hong Kong transit goods are arriving in an endless stream, with three ships from Lisheng, Yusheng, and Taiyuan bringing a total of 44,800-plus bags, all of which have been unloaded. Currently, arrivals and inventory are both abundant, and there are no special changes in the market. However, the market briefly rallied after being excited by the rise in rice prices in the afternoon of the previous day. Yesterday morning, the asking price for Huabiao and Ao flour remained at 22 dollars 5.6 jiao (a tenth of a dollar), and Kan flour Jinlong brand at 31 dollars 5.6 jiao. Subsequently, prices eased to 3 jiao or 4 jiao as rice prices fell again. Prices varied slightly between market trading and direct sales to customers, as people are calmer and speculative trading has definitely decreased.

Wheat trading remains stagnant. As domestic production prices are high, arrivals are difficult. Wheat inventories in the concessions are drying up. The market can be described as "there is a market but no goods." Currently, Fufeng is closed, and Fuxin relies solely on foreign wheat for supply at flat prices. Only factories in western Shanghai and Hongkou are buying slightly, with prices remaining at 45 dollars 6 jiao. The prospects for the wheat market lack hope for improvement.

### Miscellaneous Grains - Weakening Momentum - Soybean Oil Declines

Yesterday, markets for miscellaneous grains and soybean oil were unanimously down. Although corn prices are holding due to international issues, momentum for all goods has died down. People are unavoidably wavering, so small holders are not holding on and have started to sell. With weakening momentum, prices cannot help but decline. As a result, both futures and spot prices fell by around one dollar. Except for Guide soybeans, which continue to be supported by hoarders because of the demand from oil pressing factories, other beans continued to fall. Compared to the previous day, prices were reduced by a dollar or more. Soybean oil has been in a weak state because of pressure from the regulation company. Although there is support from hoarders outside the industry, sources of supply continue to arrive. Moreover, news that Han口oil, which had been delayed, may arrive any day has depressed people's spirits, and market prices have dropped sharply by two to four dollars.

Also, on the 19th, 1,200 cans of raw oil were imported from Qingdao. (Exported on the 20th) 565 bags of soybeans and 6,000 pieces of bean cakes were shipped to Xiamen. Another 4,000 pieces of bean cakes and 545 bags of sesame seeds were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Tightening Financial US Dollar

Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices did not change. The black market for British and American currencies felt rather stagnant. However, trading was still brisk, as speculators sold off a lot during the day. Initially, the market was similar to the afternoon prices of the previous day because HSBC was willing to buy. Later, it was heard that Chinese banks such as the Continental Bank were aggressively buying, so the underlying trend became tight. The US dollar then returned from 5.4375 dollars to 5.40625 dollars. There was little trading in British currency. At the close, both currencies lacked upward or downward movement. As a result, spot British currency remained at 3 pence 3125, and the US dollar at 5.40625, compressed 0.03125. Futures were flat.

There were no changes in futures.

In the early morning, London silver, both near and far term, was flat, and New York silver prices were still flat. London raw gold was stagnant. The exchange rate of British currency against the US dollar was unchanged, but against Shanghai it was reduced by 0.0625. The US dollar against the British pound was unchanged, but against Shanghai it was increased by 0.04. There was no market for francs. The Central Bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. At the morning opening, the bank's selling price for spot currency was 3 pence 3115 for the British pound and 5.4375 dollars for the US dollar. Compared with the closing price of the previous day, both the British pound and the US dollar were flat. After the opening, speculators heavily sold off US dollars for January delivery, which HSBC bought at 5.4375 dollars. HSBC's listed prices for various currencies remained unchanged. There was no change in the silver equalization tax. Afterwards, although speculators sold, HSBC continued to maintain. Moreover, Chinese banks such as the Continental Bank were showing buying interest, so the market softened. However, there were no changes in futures. By the close, spot currency had aligned with futures at 5.40625 dollars. The spot currency was compressed by 0.01225. Futures for the British pound remained at 3 pence 2125. There was no market in the afternoon on Monday.

Hong Kong Exchange Rates Unchanged

Hong Kong, 19th (Wednesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. Only the spot Shanghai exchange rate fell by one dollar to 450 dollars. The rest were unchanged. At 11:30 AM, the spot Shanghai exchange rate rose by one dollar to 452 dollars. There were no other changes. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.

Tianjin British and American Currencies Rise

Tianjin, 19th (Wednesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened weak this morning. The London telegraphic exchange rate rose by 0.0625 to 3.5 pence. The New York telegraphic exchange rate rose by 0.25 to 5.8125 dollars. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 0.75 to 92.75 dollars. "Joint notes" on the black market rose by 0.85 to 72.40 dollars.

### Gold Prices Stabilize

Yesterday, the gold market's raw gold black market turned from weak to firm, rising close to the 6,400-dollar mark, because the US dollar weakened and the Shanghai West Side gang suddenly stopped releasing gold. Initially, Xinyuan, Tianyuan, and Hengji small amounts fell to 6,350 dollars. Subsequently, after the bill merchants Dafeng, Xinfeng, and Yongzheng securities firms and money exchangers competed to buy, they rose to the 6,400-dollar level, where they were suppressed by sellers with price limits. In the end, they only rose ten dollars. Five or six thousand taels were traded in half a day. Sentiment was still stable on all sides. Switching from March to April, sellers still offered buyers a discount of 40 dollars. The cash market also turned firm and stable. Initially, Chengji offered 50 taels, 275 dollars higher than the futures price. Xianghe followed with 150 taels, and Hesheng with 110 taels, both 180 dollars higher. All were bought exclusively by Xiangxingyong. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The prices of gold ornaments and customs gold remained flat.

Rising Nearly 400 Dollars

In the early morning, the evening market on the previous day was unusually weak, with more sellers than buyers on the table, leading to the opening price of 6,370 dollars. After the opening, prices plummeted as Hengji, Dayuan, and others sold, falling to 6,350 dollars. It wasn't until an hour later that the market saw a high, with Zhongshengyuan, Dafeng, and Yida frequently buying, but the rise was extremely slow. After 10:30, prices gradually rose from around 80 dollars to 6,400 dollars. It was very difficult to break through the 400-dollar level, as Hesheng and Chengji were selling at that time, returning to 6,388 dollars. Subsequently, they rose again to 6,395 dollars, showing a fluctuating state. The result at the close was 6,3 hundred and twelve dollars, a rise of ten dollars compared to the market squeeze of the tenth. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The selling price of the present brand gold of cash houses was 200 dollars higher than the raw gold futures price, and the buying price was 80 dollars lower. There was no market for current standard gold, etc.

Jewelers' Gold Ornaments - Original Prices Unchanged

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at jewelers has not changed. Datongheng quoted 680 dollars, and the new line was similar to the above price. The buying price was 30 dollars lower.

### Sudden Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies

Yesterday, the foreign currency market's raw gold market turned from falling to rising. British and American gold coins also turned flat after falling. British notes remained stagnant, with the market only flat. American gold notes initially fell to 1.8 jiao and then gradually rose, the highest being 18.26 dollars, a rise of one jiao compared to the previous day's close. Hong Kong notes continued to rise, with market prices rising by one jiao. Japanese gold notes also tended to firm, rising again to 1.94 dollars in the evening market. The supply and demand for Korean notes remained balanced, with the evening market remaining at 1.6 dollars, the original level.

### Yarn Export Cotton Yarn - Factories Subsidize 60-70 Dollars

The yarn market is still in a state of fluctuation. Although actual transactions have not seen a large amount of development, in order to encourage actual yarn exports, Shuangma factories single-handedly exchange spot goods, which truly proves that those with foreign packaging can be subsidized 60 to 75 dollars per package. Because of this, the thinking of speculators has shifted toward a higher view. However, the fixed amount of the securities gang is still in the switch period and can collect profit every day, so the yarn market at this 400-dollar level presents a tug-of-war. The high price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,414 dollars, the low price was 1,395 dollars, the initial trade in the afternoon was 1,417 dollars, falling to 14 dollars, and the final price was 1,417 dollars. Also, 35 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, and 605 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuangma opened in the morning, with a peaceful atmosphere, at 1,401 dollars, rising slightly to 1,406 dollars. Subsequently, the situation on the table loosened, and the short side became active, breaking through the 400-dollar level, reaching 1,395 dollars. However, as the gold market opened steadily, profit-takers patched up, and they rose back to outside 400 dollars, then advanced to 1,396 dollars. Subsequently, because of the rise in gold prices and the fact that actual sales were still good at the same time, they successively rose and closed at 1,414 dollars. A statistical breakdown of the amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Hong Kong 820 Nanyang 350

Fellow Traders 5,800 Statistics 6,970

### American Cotton Continues to Rise - Domestic Cotton Sporadic Transactions

The current cotton market situation is relatively high, and inter-industry buying and selling is very lively, so the industry is quietly firm.

The New York cotton market rose due to short covering and reports that China Plate announced the formal implementation of loans. In addition, cotton worth millions of US dollars will be shipped to the UK within the day, so the market situation is very active. As a result, closing prices rose 20 points compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to speculation, then fell back due to profit-taking, and finally rose again due to short covering. As a result, yesterday's closing prices were still flat, with fluctuations of around two rupees. Yesterday's forecast was five and a half rupees higher than the closing price.

Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions seem to be rather stagnant because the situation is not favorable and the yarn market is fluctuating. Factories' buying intentions are quite stagnant. In recent days, there have been only sporadic transactions between industry players, making for somewhat lively trading.

### Securities - Absorption of A and B Bonds - Yesterday's Market Also Best

Yesterday, the public bond market first fell and then rose. Type C rose to 6 dollars, and in the afternoon, it rose to 6.4 dollars. Transactions were more numerous in the afternoon. Lianyi, with its widespread absorption of types A and B, represented certain money changers and can be said to have been skilled in selecting them. Yesterday's transactions occurred because the north gang Changji sold extremely vigorously in the morning, so Xiekang and a group of scattered investors followed the trend and sought to sell. The lowest price for type C fell to 66 dollars. Xieda, Shenchang, Dade, and Jiufu absorbed at low prices, gaining favorable prices. In the afternoon, Lianyi suddenly had a large appetite, about 400,000 to 500,000, and was interested in types A and B. Others, such as Tianyuan, Tongkang Yichang, and Lianhe also had a strong appetite, either covering shorts or adding positions, and the market rose slowly. Suppliers such as Maili Shuntai, Jiufeng, Runde, Xiexingyuan, and Jiucheng provided a small amount. Type C was too long, so the rise was easily frustrated. Type A, as one of the best of the five types of public bonds, was the most selected. As a result, market prices showed mixed ups and downs. Types A, B, and C rose two to six jiao, and the rest rose by a small one to three jiao. The total number of transactions was estimated at one million dollars. A concise table is listed below:

Stock transactions involved 500 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, priced at 19.7 dollars per share.

Also, the stock market of the Zhongye Company opened rather stably, but the price softened slightly after many floating shares were released. London, 18th Wednesday Telegram: The listed market for Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British companies' stocks remains stagnant. British shares showed slight weakness. The price of Baoan Insurance shares fell by one pound to 23 shillings. The price of the Macali Bank shares fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 8 pounds 12 shillings and 6 pence. The new price of Youli Bank shares after dividend payment remains at 11.5 pounds, with no change. The rest were also unchanged.

### Piece Goods - Eastern Piece Goods Fall Back and Recover - Factory Cloth Also Brought Up

The factory cloth market turned firm yesterday because Eastern piece goods had fallen for two consecutive days. Yesterday, a sudden wind came and the price of cotton factory cloth was pulled up, although Zhejiang merchants cannot load goods, they still procure when cheap, and transactions have slightly increased. White rough cloth has stabilized. Twill fine cloth has risen by about 5 jiao per piece. Fugui fine cloth opened in the morning at 43 dollars and 2.5 jiao, and increased to 43 dollars and 7.5 jiao in the afternoon. The general market for bleached and dyed cloth is stable.

Zhejiang and Fujian merchants procured 100-plus pieces of rough cloth, colored cloth, and fine cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants procured 200-plus pieces of blue cloth, woolen cloth, and serge.

Yesterday, because of the higher outlook inside and outside the industry, transactions continued to be brisk. Fine cloth futures in the exchange rose 1 dollar per piece. The closing price for spot leading fine cloth was 48 dollars and 3.5 jiao, a rise of 6 jiao. The opening price of Four Gentlemen serge was high at 1 dollar 3.825 fen (a hundredth of a jiao), and at the close, it was 1 dollar 3.8 fen, also up about 2 fen.

### Metals - Black Iron Billets Leap Again and Again

The recent prosperity of the hardware market has created a new record. It is not surprising that the standard of each goods exceeds 20% or 10%, and even one or two times is common. Black iron billets are one example. The initial price of this goods was only about 2,000 dollars. However, since recently, overseas sources have been insufficient. Although the base in Shanghai is not thin, it has been repeatedly absorbed by merchants, and the circulating goods on the market are becoming scarce as billet factories, printing factories, mirror factories, and machine factories continue to procure, so the holders' outlook is surprisingly high and prices leap again and again. Yesterday, every 2,000 pounds required 2,500 dollars, a huge increase compared to the previous market.

### Sweet Potato

– Gao Jianchen

If the potato occupies such an important position in the food of Europeans and Americans, it can truly be called "clothing and supporting all creatures, satisfying all kinds," then, among the plants in China, the one that can stand shoulder to shoulder with it without shame is undoubtedly the sweet potato that we know so well. Just as the potato moved from South America to North America and Europe, the sweet potato is not native to our country either: it began to settle in China in the third or fourth century AD; and it has a half-brother called the sweet potato or red potato, but it lives next to the potato, and with the help of the Spanish, it traveled across the ocean in the late sixteenth century to benefit China. Now let's talk about the process of their two brothers arriving gracefully.

The tuber plant native to our country is the taro: the "I have heard that under Mount Wen there is fertile land and water chestnuts, and you will not be hungry until death" in the Biography of the Moneymakers in the Records of the Historian is also; there is also yam, commonly known as yam, and the Classic of Mountains and Seas Northern Mountain Classic says "Looking north from Jing Mountain to Shaoze, there are many grass on it". The ancient poets of our country, because they were familiar with these two kinds of plants, once they came into contact with a similar new plant from a distant foreign land, would naturally use familiar names to call it, and compare it with the shape and taste of the inherent plants, in order to make it easy for others to understand. Therefore, Ji Han of the Jin Dynasty said in his Southern Grass and Trees: "The sweet potato is like a kind of yam, or a kind of taro, and its root is also like a taro. Its fruit is like a fist, and some are like a basin. Its skin is purple and its flesh is white; it is steamed into porridge and eaten, and its taste is like yam, and its nature is not very cold. In the old land of Zhuxu, people in the sea do not engage in farming, but only dig the ground to plant sweet potatoes, which are harvested in the autumn, ... to fill their hunger. ... People in the sea who live to be over a hundred years old are because they do not eat nine grains, but eat sweet potatoes." Jia Sixie of the Later Wei Dynasty said in Qimin Yaoshu: "Sweet potatoes... are planted in the month and ripen in October... from Jiaozhi Jiuzhen". Chen Qichang of the Tang Dynasty also said in Yiwuzhi: "Sweet potatoes come from Jiaoguang. ... Its roots are like taro, and there are also huge ones, the large ones are like goose eggs, and the small ones are like chicken eggs. Peel off the purple skin, and the flesh is as white as grease." I think the original name of the sweet potato in "the sea" and in "Jiaozhi Jiuzhen" cannot be known; we call it "potato", "yam", or "mountain taro", which is completely a strong imposition of the old name on it, which is very clear and beyond doubt.

### Public Transportation Strike in Both Settlements Yesterday Morning; British-Owned Public Buses Resume Service Today; French Tramway Workers' Strike: Negotiations Between Both Sides Still Pending

The workers of the French Tramway Company and the British-owned Public Bus Company went on strike yesterday to demand better treatment, causing the complete shutdown of trams, trolleybuses, and buses in the French Concession, as well as public buses on all routes in the International Settlement. Regarding the British-owned public bus strike, Mr. Gu Bingyuan, the mediation director of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, mediated a three-point solution at 4:00 PM yesterday. Work fully resumed at around 7:00 PM. It is reported that the French Concession Political Department is conducting mediation regarding the French tram strike to prevent the strike from expanding and affecting local security and public transportation.

French Tramcars
Completely Suspended

Mediation Fails
Strike Begins Yesterday Morning

Due to soaring prices and difficult living conditions, the workers of the French Tramway Company in the French Concession, particularly those facing the most severe threat from rising rice prices, requested an increase in rice subsidies from the company authorities. The French police political department summoned two representatives to the political department for mediation at 8:00 PM the night before, informing them that the company director, Mr. Fafoley, would respond to the workers' demands on the 25th. However, the workers believed that the company had no sincerity and went on strike yesterday morning around 7:00 AM. At 10:40 AM, over two thousand drivers and ticket sellers on French trams, trolleybuses, and buses operating on various routes responded in unison, stopping their vehicles and forcing passengers to disembark before abandoning the vehicles in the middle of the street.

Vehicles on All Routes
Stopped Mid-Route

After the suspension of vehicles on all routes in the French Concession, drivers and ticket sellers left their vehicles one after another. The traffic was immediately blocked with the vehicles stranded mid-route. On Avenue Edward VII, the No. 21 and No. 22 public buses were lined up one after the other. On Avenue Joffre, Rue Cardinal Foch, Avenue du Consul General, Route Say Zoong, and the Ximen Road area, the vehicles stopped were all trams on routes No. 1, No. 2, No. 7, No. 10, and No. 5. Eighteen trolleybuses were stopped at the intersection of Rue du Marché and Route Conty, and seven trolleybuses were stopped at Nanyang Bridge on Route Annaquin. Seven vehicles were stopped at the intersection of Rue de la Gare and Route Père Huc, blocking traffic. At this time, the No. 17 trolleybuses in the International Settlement, which originally went to Dapu Bridge, all stopped in the French Concession and turned around at the Great World. Around noon, the Public Works Department specially dispatched many foreign workers to drive all the vehicles stopped on the road back to the Rue Luban depot, each vehicle protected by two policemen. The police also sent a large number of detectives to closely guard various traffic routes and the depot.

Both Parties Have Not
Yet Held Negotiations

Earlier, at 8:30 AM, some of the French tram and bus workers who were not on duty gathered for a meeting to discuss the strike. It is widely believed that this strike was carefully planned and had some "political factors" involved. After the incident, the French Tramway Company authorities and the French police political department immediately tried to mediate. It is widely believed that the workers have put forward ten demands, but their content has not been disclosed by the responsible parties. However, it is believed that the most important demands are wage increases and rice subsidies. It is reported that the company was quite surprised by the workers' sudden action but, in order to safeguard the overall situation, is considering the workers' demands. The political department is also mediating, so there is hope for a satisfactory resolution. The general public is very sympathetic to all workers, as prices are currently high and life is difficult. However, it is deeply hoped that all workers will not allow others to create excuses and put the public in a disadvantageous position. It is reported that the French Tramway Company bus workers held a general meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss countermeasures. It is also reported that the labor and management sides did not hold direct negotiations yesterday.

Bus Strike
Trams Still Running

The workers of the British-owned Chinese Public Bus Company in the International Settlement demanded rice subsidies and living allowances. Around 11:00 AM yesterday, all drivers, ticket sellers, and coppersmiths went on strike, causing the complete suspension of public buses on all routes. Except for a portion of the buses that returned to the Connaught Road head office and were stranded, the rest were stopped in the Jing'an Temple area, etc., and all route signs were removed. After receiving the report, the police stations in the International Settlement were closely guarded, and the area around the company was heavily guarded. As for the trams and trolleybuses of the British-owned Tramway Company on various routes, they continued to operate as usual, but stopped entering the French Concession. In order to maintain traffic in the International Settlement, the number of vehicles in service was temporarily increased.

Signing of Agreement
Declares Resolution

Mr. Gu Bingyuan, the mediation director of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, conducted mediation in the office of the Public Bus Company in the Sassoon House at 4:00 PM yesterday. The company manager, Mr. Anor Jones, the secretary, Mr. Courley, and the workers' representatives, Mr. Zhang Aqing, Mr. Sun Yunlong, and others, as well as Mr. Fan Yifeng, agreed to sign three points of the agreement, declaring the resolution: (1) The rice subsidy for March will be temporarily calculated based on the rice price of $110 per picul on March 15, and $55 will be temporarily issued. It will be issued on March 21, and the retail rice price investigated by the Public Works Department on March 21 will be used as the standard. It will be settled again at the end of March, with supplements for shortages and deductions for surpluses. (2) Starting from April, the rice subsidy will be calculated based on the standards of the 15th and 19th of each month and issued on the 19th of each month. The retail rice price investigated by the Public Works Department will be used as the standard until the end of the month, with deductions for surpluses and supplements for shortages. (3) Regarding the workers' request for a living allowance, the company will consider it and respond later.

Full Resumption of Service
This Morning

After the mediation of the public bus strike was declared resolved, the workers' representatives immediately notified all the workers to resume work at 7:00 PM last night. The coppersmiths, drivers, and ticket sellers immediately entered the factory to resume work. Public buses on all routes, such as No. 1, No. 25, No. 7, No. 9, No. 10, No. 12, No. 14, and No. 15, have fully resumed service. Starting this morning, public buses on all routes in the International Settlement will be able to return to the normal state before the strike. As for the various temporary precautions taken by the police stations for the public bus workers' strike, they were lifted after the workers resumed work. All sectors expressed admiration for the Public Works Department's prompt handling and resolution of the matter.

Six Hundred Thousand Dollars First Remitted for Taiwan Relief

The Shanghai Taiwan Disaster Relief Association, jointly organized by Taiwan natives from Zhejiang Province residing in Shanghai and major philanthropists in Shanghai, believes that the disaster situation in various counties in Taiwan is extremely severe. On the 15th, it was decided to first remit $60,000 to handle price stabilization. At the same time, efforts are still being made to raise funds.

### Anti-Corruption Propaganda Society Searched Yesterday; Books and Badges Confiscated

Around 9:00 AM yesterday, ten armed foreigners in cars arrived at the French Concession Police Station and requested that officers be dispatched to conduct a thorough search of No. 2, Lane 500, Rue West Alexis. As a result, more than 1,030 copies of the small book "Ming Deng" (Bright Lamp) and dozens of badges of the "Chinese Anti-Corruption Propaganda Society" were confiscated from the third floor and taken to the police station. However, the room was empty, so no arrests were made.

### Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Relocated to Hong Kong Urges Communist Party to Recognize Situation and to Fulfill the Promise of Joint Resistance Against Aggression and to Strive for Victory Under One Government

Hong Kong, 19th: Since relocating to Hong Kong, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has continued its work as usual, making unremitting efforts. Recently, in view of the fact that seven Communist Party councilors refused to attend the second National Political Council due to the disbandment of the New Fourth Army, causing a bad impression nationwide, the Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram from Hong Kong to Mao Zedong and other seven councilors in Yan'an to advise them. The original telegram is excerpted as follows:

To Councilors Mao Zedong of Yan'an, and forwarded to Messrs. Chen Shaoyu, Qin Bangxian, Lin Zuhan, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, and Deng Yingchao: Military orders need to be unified, and politics cannot be fragmented. This is true in ordinary times, especially in extraordinary times. Since your party published a declaration in 1937 to jointly resist aggression, it has been admired far and wide. Although the actual situation is not something that our Chamber of Commerce dares to speculate on, the actions of the New Fourth Army in Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces are closer and known in more detail. What we have heard and seen is inconvenient and unbearable to speak of. Since the Central Government has been forced to order its disbandment, some commentators still say that it is too late. Unexpectedly, you gentlemen want to use this as an excuse to abandon the promises made by your party before. It is inevitable that those close to you will be pained and your enemies will be happy. Moreover, democratic politics is the unanimous desire of the whole country, and the National Political Council is the only institution that expresses the national will at present. If you gentlemen have any opinions, you should submit them to the council for public discussion. We have never heard of treating the council as an enemy and first setting conditions to bargain, as if it were a market. Lightly starting a wall-quarreling dispute should deeply heed the warning of an overturned nest. What day is today? How can we allow ourselves to be mistaken again? If the entire nation perishes, we do not believe that any one party or one class can prosper and survive alone. As clear-minded as you gentlemen are, why do we need to nag? We hope that you will adhere to your original intentions, fulfill your promises, and strive for victory under one government and one military order. The future of the country and the nation deeply depends on it. We offer our sincere hopes for your consideration. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, respectfully, Qiao, (18th)

### Public Works Department's Stance on Rice Market: Ensure Reasonable Selling Prices; Two Directors to Study Cooperation Methods; New Measures to Be Deployed After Prior Arrangements; Department's Own Procurement for Market Supply Is the Best Strategy

Regarding stabilizing the rice market, all sectors are unanimously hoping that the authorities of the two settlements will use all their powers to dredge up domestic and foreign rice sources and severely punish rice speculators. When the Public Works Department of the International Settlement held its routine board meeting yesterday, the four million residents of the city were also deeply concerned. It is widely believed that the authorities are determined to punish rice weevils and stabilize food prices. Now that the authorities recognize that suppressing rice prices and stabilizing food prices are urgent priorities, all sectors of the city unanimously hope that the authorities will actively proceed to achieve the grand goal. In recent days, labor strikes have been stirring again, all using high rice prices as an excuse, and the underground rebate method has caused disputes between labor and management in various industries that have already issued rice subsidies according to the Public Works Department's cost of living index, causing new disturbances. This still depends on the joint efforts of both sides.

Public Works Department Meeting

The Public Works Department issued a statement on the board's discussion of the rice market situation, saying: "Regarding the rice issue in this city, the board of directors of the department discussed it at its routine meeting yesterday. All directors unanimously agreed that active and rapid measures are needed to improve the rice market."

Study Cooperation

"The department has considered the reports and suggestions of the Food Subcommittee and the letter from the Shanghai Food Evaluation Committee to the subcommittee. However, before starting a new measure, it is believed that any measures that affect neighboring areas and require their cooperation need to be restudied to achieve far-reaching results. This study is now being conducted by two directors. The department will definitely decide on how to deal with the rice market issue."

Focus on Supply

"The high rice prices have become a topic of public discussion, and the department is deeply moved by public opinion. However, it must be known that the crux of the issue lies in the transportation of rice from the production areas to Shanghai, the maintenance of sufficient rice stocks in this city, and the distribution and continuous circulation of rice through legitimate rice businesses. The experience and goodwill of genuine merchants are essential to any solution to this problem. The department will work with them to eliminate all malpractices, restore stability to the rice market, and ensure that this city has sufficient rice at reasonable prices."

Rice Hoarding Locations

The English-language "China Press" stated that the Shanghai rice situation is deteriorating further today (19th), as there are no fixed prices for the sale of various types of rice in the two settlements. According to unconfirmed reports, a large amount of tribute rice that arrived in port in the past few weeks is stored in Pudong and areas where the settlement authorities have no direct control. Observers believe that if the responsible authorities do not take strict measures in the short term, rice prices may become chaotic. The entire board of directors of the Public Works Department held a meeting at the department building this morning to discuss ways to curb the rice crisis. Unconfirmed reports say that the Public Works Department may decide to procure a large amount of tribute rice to alleviate the crisis.

Rice Ships Arrive in Shanghai

The "Continental Daily News" stated that business people believe that Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing will raise the issue of establishing public warehouses in Shanghai again. This suggestion was rumored two months ago. Although the banking and business communities in the city reportedly strongly supported this suggestion, the initiators have not taken concrete steps to organize the public warehouses. According to yesterday's news, the French authorities here have telegraphed exporters in Saigon, asking them to speed up the transportation of rice to Shanghai. The French authorities have also asked French shipping companies to cooperate in this matter. Shipping companies claim that most of the French ships still sailing between Vietnam and Shanghai transport rice and coal to supply this city. The French ship "Kaidin" (transliteration) arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon with 10,000 bags of tribute rice. The "Yalian Peishalute" (transliteration) is scheduled to enter the port on Saturday with 24,000 bags of rice. The ship flying the Panamanian flag, "Qiaier Duladu" (transliteration),

Underground Rebates Slightly Reduced

In recent days, illegal transactions in the rice market have emerged one after another, and black market "rebates" have soared. The "rebate" for small-grained rice has broken through the 4,000 yuan mark per hundred bags, which is more than 40 yuan per bag above the price limit. The price increase and profiteering are particularly distressing. After the rice market opened yesterday morning, it initially showed a stable state, and people's minds also eased from tension. Large households gradually supplied their stockpiled goods to the market, and the market situation gradually improved. As a result, black market "rebates" fell by 200 to 300 yuan compared to the previous market, which is a drop of three yuan per bag. Due to the stagnant sales of domestic rice, market prices also fell by one or two yuan. However, large buyers such as Daxinyuan and Hesheng, who raised prices to purchase, are still trading outside the market, which is one of the main reasons why rice prices do not fall.

Price Increase for Affordable Rice

The Christian Moore Memorial Church has been selling affordable white rice for two years without interruption, and the poor have benefited greatly. Due to rising rice prices, the selling price has been changed to 20 cents per catty starting yesterday (last year it was only 10 cents; from January 26, it was changed to 15 cents). However, because there are many poor people buying, it started earlier at 9:00 AM during daylight saving time. The poor people, with old people and children in tow, stood in front of the church as early as 3:30 AM, hoping to get there first. By 6:00 AM, no fewer than five or six hundred people had gathered, surrounding the church. Those arriving later continued to arrive, which proves the general hardship of the hungry masses forced by life.

Tragic Abandonment of Infants

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired at the Pushan Villa, the number of exposed corpses collected by the church recently has increased sharply. An investigation of the types of corpses shows that children account for the vast majority. The reason is nothing more than the high rice prices, poor families cannot afford it, and some have abandoned newborn babies. Therefore, among these children's corpses, many have just died or are dying. According to the villa's records, among the 117 corpses collected in the International Settlement yesterday, children's corpses accounted for 95. This is a serious social problem.

### International Strange Monk Zhao Kong Has Left Shanghai

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired from the Buddhist community in this city, the international strange monk Zhao Kong is no longer in Shanghai. Many of his male and female followers have also left the country with him. Zhao Kong has been mingling in the Chinese Buddhist community for a long time, and he participated in any Buddhist gathering. Since the outbreak of this European war, his whereabouts have been rarely seen. As early as five or six years ago, Zhao Kong once left Shanghai for Europe, but during the First European War, he was suspected of being a spy and was expelled. At that time, he extravagantly claimed that he would build a sailboat and cross over to Europe, but this argument soon died down. Zhao Kong was originally from Hungary and was ordained in Louxia Temple. His male and female followers are all foreign nationals.

### All Sectors to Celebrate Tomorrow Local Restoration Memorial Recalling Local Glorious History and Firmly Upholding the National Policy of Resistance and Reconstruction

Tomorrow (21st) is the anniversary of the recovery of Songhu by the National Revolutionary Army (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly stated that it was today). All sectors in Shanghai unanimously expressed their spiritual celebration without holding any ceremonies. Schools will also be closed as usual. All sectors will recall the glorious history of the area, firmly uphold the national policy of resisting aggression and rebuilding the country, and continue to promote economical donations and compete to purchase wartime bonds to complete the mission of national revival.

### Japanese Side Acknowledges Consultation on Annual Election of Public Works Department Directors, But British and Japanese Residents Still Prepare to Run; British Residents Determined to Have Incumbent British Directors Participate

Japanese officials in this city admitted yesterday morning (19th) that British and Japanese residents are consulting on the annual election of Public Works Department directors to be held on April 2nd and 3rd. It is said that whether the election will not be held this year will depend entirely on the results of the ongoing consultations between British and Japanese residents. Japanese taxpayers insist on increasing the number of Japanese director candidates and will not allow the status quo to continue this year. The only way to get Japanese residents to agree to maintain the current ratio of directors is to defeat Japanese taxpayers with a majority of votes.

Japanese Residents Continue
to Prepare for Election

It is also heard that Japanese taxpayers are continuing with their plan to recommend at least three candidates this year. It is expected that the current Japanese directors, Okamoto and Hanawa, will both participate in this year's election in order to be re-elected. The names of the additional Japanese director candidates have not been disclosed. It is heard that the British Residents Association has suggested to the Japanese residents that no election be held this year and that all the current directors be re-elected for twelve months. However, the Japanese side has made a counter-proposal, demanding an increase in the number of Japanese directors. So far, only the American residents have nominated two candidates, Mindes and Alerman.

British Residents Association Decides on Plan

The "Shanghai Times" reported that British officials stated that the election committee of the British Residents Association in this city has decided to have the current five British directors of the Public Works Department (headed by the chairman of the Public Works Department, Keith) participate in the director election to be held on April 2nd and 3rd in order to be re-elected.

British Side Denies
Agreement Reached

British officials also denied learning of the "gentleman's agreement" between British and Japanese residents. It is said that this statement was spread last night, and it contained statements that according to the agreement, the British residents would make concessions so that the Japanese directors of the Public Works Department from 1941 to 1942 could add one or two seats. The deadline for nominating candidates for the Public Works Department director election has been set for the 25th.

Mikhael Continues
as Deputy Chairman

Mr. Ibusuki, the Japanese Deputy General Manager of the Public Works Department, resigned on the 28th of last month. The Japanese Consulate General recommended Mr. Teraoka as his successor. According to the department's news, Mr. Teraoka is now scheduled to officially take office next month. In addition, Mr. Kana, the director and deputy chairman of the board of directors of the Public Works Department, has resigned and returned to the United States. The vacated position was originally scheduled to be succeeded by Mr. Mindes. Now, Dr. Mindes is willing to serve as a member of the Health Committee and other committees due to his heavy duties. The position of Deputy Chairman will be taken by Director Mikhael.

### Yu Qiaqing
Leaves Shanghai for Hong Kong

According to reliable information, Mr. Yu Qiaqing, the Chinese director of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, left Shanghai for Hong Kong by ship on the 17th of this month. Accompanied by Yang Guanbei and others. It is heard that Yu will travel to Manila on this trip, and may travel to Chongqing before going to Manila.

### Japan to Issue Interest-Free Bonds, Face Value Set at Two Yuan Per Bond, with Hope of Winning 2,000 Yuan Prize

The English-language "China Press" reported that Japan will issue new bonds with a face value of two yen from May of this year and sell them to the Japanese people in order to raise more funds to make up for the ever-increasing funding shortage of the Tokyo government. These new bonds will be repaid within five years and are interest-free, but subscribers have the hope of winning a prize of 2,000 yuan.

### British Merchants in Hankou and Yichang Are in Dire Straits; The Yangtze River Has Not Been Opened and Trade Cannot Be Established

According to the Reuters news agency in Hankou, at the annual meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hankou, Chairman Tott reported that the business of the British in Hankou in 1940 encountered extremely severe restrictions from the Japanese side. He said that the Japanese military authorities in Yichang continued to

forcibly seize

the goods in British ships, even though a powerful representative of the British authorities was stationed there. This infringement of the rights of neutral countries cannot be considered fair. Regarding the business of the British in Hankou, Tott said that it is now under Japanese control. Foreigners have almost no way to intervene except to buy and sell accumulated goods locally. Moreover, due to the scarcity of rural products, the export market has completely stopped. On the import side, the British have no business to report. He said that products from third countries can be seen in the market, but all are goods transported by the Japanese with the permission of the Japanese authorities, mostly claiming to be of good quality or able to fill the local economic needs. Tott continued, in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, British property

is still being infringed

and there is no improvement. The Japanese side has always promoted the opening of the Yangtze River, but it has never been realized. Therefore, the area where the British can operate is only 170 miles of the 1,400-mile section between Shanghai and Chongqing. In the looted Yangtze River basin, it is difficult to say that there is reason to let one country alone shoulder the "revival" giant without allowing other countries to operate freely. According to Tott, in the past year, except for Japan, almost no foreign ships have docked in Hankou. Although several consultations and negotiations have been conducted, the Japanese have always used the excuse of "military necessity" to prohibit us from legally using Hankou's docks and pontoons. It is reported that the British and their property in the Yichang area have suffered deeply from the Japanese control and "severance," especially daily necessities. They are not even allowed to enter Japanese shops to buy them.

### Bloody Incident at Yipinxiang Last Night; Two Men Shot Dead; Three Murderers Are Close Friends of the Deceased; Entered the Room Talking and Laughing, Then Opened Fire and Fled

At noon on the 18th, two men, one thin, in his twenties, and one fat, in his thirties, went to the Yipinxiang Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road to open a room. They were taken to the third floor by a waiter and opened room 58. Zhang Renjie, 36 years old, was written on the registration book. Until 10:30 PM last night, three men wearing Chinese clothes and overcoats went to the room and knocked on the door. The two men invited them in and ordered tea.

They talked and laughed very happily. The waiter then went out. About ten minutes later, seven or eight gunshots suddenly rang out from the room. Shortly after, the three men in Chinese clothes hurriedly left the room and fled without a trace. The waiter immediately entered the room and saw that both the fat and thin men were lying in pools of blood. The fat man

had four shots in his body: two in his right hand, one in his left ear, and one in his chest. The thin man had one shot in the back of his head and was barely breathing. The waiter was shocked and immediately reported it to the cashier, who reported it to the police. A large number of detectives were dispatched to investigate, and an ambulance was urgently called to transport the two men to Renji Hospital for treatment, but because the injuries were critical, they did not arrive at the hospital

and both died

After examination by the hospital doctors, it was impossible to save them. The bodies of the two men were then transferred to the morgue for autopsy. After the incident, the detectives found a letter on the table in the room. The envelope was addressed to "Sha Xingru, No. 26, Liangpeng Pass, Yangjiao Mountain, Liuzhou, Guangxi," and below it was written "Ma Sisi Sealed." There was also a copy of the constitution of Great China University. When the thin man was killed, he was wearing a blue cloth lined robe and gray cloth shirt and pants. The fat man was wearing a cotton flannel lined robe and gray blue satin lined jacket and pants. The police authorities are conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the deaths of the two men. 20,000 bags of soft rice are scheduled to arrive this afternoon.

Underground Rebates Slightly Reduced

In recent days, illegal transactions in the rice market have emerged one after another, and black market "rebates" have soared. The "rebate" for small-grained rice has broken through the 4,000 yuan mark per hundred bags, which is more than 40 yuan per bag above the price limit. The price increase and profiteering are particularly distressing. After the rice market opened yesterday morning, it initially showed a stable state, and people's minds also eased from tension. Large households gradually supplied their stockpiled goods to the market, and the market situation gradually improved. As a result, black market "rebates" fell by 200 to 300 yuan compared to the previous market, which is a drop of three yuan per bag. Due to the stagnant sales of domestic rice, market prices also fell by one or two yuan. However, large buyers such as Daxinyuan and Hesheng, who raised prices to purchase, are still trading outside the market, which is one of the main reasons why rice prices do not fall.

Price Increase for Affordable Rice

The Christian Moore Memorial Church has been selling affordable white rice for two years without interruption, and the poor have benefited greatly. Due to rising rice prices, the selling price has been changed to 20 cents per catty starting yesterday (last year it was only 10 cents; from January 26, it was changed to 15 cents). However, because there are many poor people buying, it started earlier at 9:00 AM during daylight saving time. The poor people, with old people and children in tow, stood in front of the church as early as 3:30 AM, hoping to get there first. By 6:00 AM, no fewer than five or six hundred people had gathered, surrounding the church. Those arriving later continued to arrive, which proves the general hardship of the hungry masses forced by life.

Tragic Abandonment of Infants

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired at the Pushan Villa, the number of exposed corpses collected by the church recently has increased sharply. An investigation of the types of corpses shows that children account for the vast majority. The reason is nothing more than the high rice prices, poor families cannot afford it, and some have abandoned newborn babies. Therefore, among these children's corpses, many have just died or are dying. According to the villa's records, among the 117 corpses collected in the International Settlement yesterday, children's corpses accounted for 95. This is a serious social problem.

### International Strange Monk Zhao Kong Has Left Shanghai

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired from the Buddhist community in this city, the international strange monk Zhao Kong is no longer in Shanghai. Many of his male and female followers have also left the country with him. Zhao Kong has been mingling in the Chinese Buddhist community for a long time, and he participated in any Buddhist gathering. Since the outbreak of this European war, his whereabouts have been rarely seen. As early as five or six years ago, Zhao Kong once left Shanghai for Europe, but during the First European War, he was suspected of being a spy and was expelled. At that time, he extravagantly claimed that he would build a sailboat and cross over to Europe, but this argument soon died down. Zhao Kong was originally from Hungary and was ordained in Louxia Temple. His male and female followers are all foreign nationals.

### All Sectors to Celebrate Tomorrow Local Restoration Memorial Recalling Local Glorious History and Firmly Upholding the National Policy of Resistance and Reconstruction

Tomorrow (21st) is the anniversary of the recovery of Songhu by the National Revolutionary Army (yesterday's newspaper mistakenly stated that it was today). All sectors in Shanghai unanimously expressed their spiritual celebration without holding any ceremonies. Schools will also be closed as usual. All sectors will recall the glorious history of the area, firmly uphold the national policy of resisting aggression and rebuilding the country, and continue to promote economical donations and compete to purchase wartime bonds to complete the mission of national revival.

### Eastern Front Chinese Troops Begin Counteroffensive

The Chinese troops on the Eastern Front, since Commander Shangguan led his troops eastward, planning a counteroffensive, have established close contact with all Chinese forces. Led by Commander Ruan's elite troops of the Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army, and coordinating with the New Army, totaling more than 40,000 men, equipped with the latest light and heavy weapons, and with some mechanized units and air defense equipment. Heavy artillery and warhorses are complete, heading one after another to the Zhejiang-Anhui border, arriving successively at the predetermined locations. Since advancing eastward, they have successively recovered important strongholds such as Qixing Bridge, Xiajian Temple, Pingguang, and Jinze. Now they are actively starting a counteroffensive, first completely eliminating the main mercenary force of the Ding unit, and then adopting a strategy of destroying them one by one, eliminating Zhou Damin, Ren Tianshi, and all the bandits entrenched in areas such as Wujiang, Pingwang, Kunshan, Bacheng, Qiandun, Changshu, Bailiukou, Qingpu, and Xicen. Bandit leader Zhou Damin was captured, and the captured convicts have already been sent to the rear for training and to be reformed. The Chinese side has dispersed into five routes, actively advancing towards the counties on the outskirts of Shanghai, and has completed an arc-shaped encirclement. Soon there will be large-scale mobile warfare. However, according to people from the war zone arriving in Shanghai, the discipline of the Chinese troops is strict. As they pass through various places, they cooperate with the local armed organizations, causing mercenaries in various places to automatically revolt. It is expected that there will be significant results within half a month.

### Gasoline Price Increase Two Jiao Per Gallon Car Companies Consider Price Increases

Major foreign gasoline companies in this city announced yesterday (the 19th) a uniform increase of two jiao per gallon of gasoline. According to a certain employee of the Mobil Oil Company yesterday morning, more gasoline will arrive in Shanghai soon, so gasoline shortages are not expected. However, freight costs and the expenses in this city have recently risen sharply, making it necessary to increase gasoline prices from 3.40 yuan to 3.60 yuan per gallon. Yesterday morning, sources from various taxi companies stated that they would soon meet to discuss the gasoline price increase. Unless they conduct research and determine whether current revenue can be maintained after the gasoline price increase, taxi fares will not be increased.

### Zhenjiang Sojourners Association in Shanghai Held Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday

The Zhenjiang Sojourners Association in Shanghai held a full executive committee meeting yesterday at the Jin Cheng Bank Auditorium. More than twenty people, including Wu Yunzhai, attended. The following resolutions were passed: (1) To establish a solicitation committee, invite prominent figures from Shanghai to serve as committee members, solicit new members, and start collecting membership fees from April 1st; (2) Regarding member Yang Chonggao's proposal to establish a Zhenjiang student loan fund, group weddings, and employment services, it was resolved to have Jiang Furen, Yin Shuguang, and Cheng Zuoqing, together with various standing committee members, review the original proposal and form another committee to handle the matter; (3) Regarding member Jiang Furen and others' letter requesting relief for the rice shortage in Eastern Zhenjiang, it was resolved to send separate letters to the Relief Committee, the Chinese Jisheng Society, and the Red Swastika Society to request relief, and to solicit donations from sojourners in Shanghai.

### United States Intensifies Aid to China Overcoming the Plague and Suppressing Totalitarianism Roosevelt's Remarks Are Nothing Short of a Guarantee

U.S. aid to China is now moving towards an active implementation process. Dr. Currie, President Roosevelt's personal representative, visited China to study the economy and provide financial assistance. However, after Dr. Currie left China and arrived in Honolulu, there was some adverse propaganda against the Chinese side. However, this unintentional propaganda was refuted by President Roosevelt's statement at the White House last Saturday, declaring resolute support for China. The Mainland News' editorial yesterday also commented on President Roosevelt's guarantee of resolute aid to China.

Promise of Aid to China To Be Implemented Soon

After visiting Chongqing and other places, Dr. Currie reported his findings to President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt then gave another speech, reiterating the U.S. attitude towards China. This move effectively countered the Tokyo newspaper's reports about Dr. Currie submitting a report unfavorable to China to President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt's speech further indicated that China would be aided in the same manner as Britain. This promise is nothing short of a guarantee. President Roosevelt's great talent and eloquence are known worldwide, but he is not forgetful, forgetting today what he said yesterday. President Roosevelt always puts his words into action, with consistency between words and deeds. This can be proven by past events. Three and a half years ago, President Roosevelt gave a speech in Chicago, stating that the United States would isolate the "plague" of aggressors and strive to suppress the development of totalitarian states.

Belief in Victory Grows Stronger

At the annual banquet of the Associated Press last Saturday at the White House, President Roosevelt clearly stated that hundreds of millions of Chinese people have shown great determination to resist internal division. China, under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, is requesting our assistance, and the United States has declared that China will receive our assistance. Our country should act according to the wishes of the people and do it resolutely. The arsenal of democracy, such words would be meaningless if spoken by others, but coming from the mouth of the President of the United States, they carry great weight and will be felt by the Axis powers. The President's position is supported by the entire American people, and the United States has tools that no other country possesses to realize the President's words. For three years and eight months, China has had confidence in winning this war, and this confidence has been further strengthened by President Roosevelt's recent remarks.

### New Pu Yu Tang Continues to Receive Donations

The New Pu Yu Tang continued to receive enthusiastic donations from all walks of life yesterday. The three nuns and Mr. and Mrs. Hu Ji'an also generously donated large sums of money, showing compassion and boundless merit. The hall accommodates nearly a thousand orphaned children, and the monthly expenses are considerable. It is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to donate. The donations received yesterday are recorded as follows: three nuns, 2,000 yuan; Mr. and Mrs. Hu Ji'an, 1,000 yuan; (for the full moon of their son) Liang Huichuan, 300 yuan; Luo Yuzhang, 200 yuan; Wang Guangfang and Xu Wenfu, 150 yuan each; Heji, Xu Meiqing, Yu Pingzheng, and He Ruiguo, 100 yuan each; Jin Mingde, Zhou Yufu, and Lu Shucheng, 50 yuan each; Bi Xingbo and Zhang Xuechun, 30 yuan each; Huang Shengfu, Cheng Yangtian, Chen Rong, and Miss Zhao Wei, 10 yuan each; Zhu Fusheng, 31 chi of cowhide; Xieji, 20 yuan; Fuji, 100 yuan; Yuanji, 150 pairs of cowhide children's shoe soles; Zheng Guodian, 1 yuan; Lei Si, 2 yuan. On behalf of the orphaned children of the hall, sincere thanks are extended.

### Tax System Council Investigation Work Completed in Two Weeks Taxpayers Meeting to Be Held Next Month

According to Mr. Gray, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax System Council, speaking to reporters yesterday, the council's investigation work will be completed within two weeks. It is heard that the council will prepare a report based on the results of the investigation and submit it to the Municipal Council for discussion at the annual meeting of Western taxpayers next month. It is widely believed that at that time, the annual meeting of Western taxpayers will vote on whether to re-evaluate the value of owner-occupied land. According to Mr. Gray, although attendees at the special meeting of Western taxpayers heavily criticized the tax issue, since the establishment of the council, very few taxpayers have come forward to express their opinions, which has greatly disappointed the council. As of now, only Mr. Liddell has verbally expressed his opinions to the council. Mr. Liddell has attended the council twice, each time for two hours. In addition, the council has received several letters from Mr. Liddell and the Shanghai Tenants Association, as well as some letters forwarded by the Municipal Council. The council has paid close attention to the opinions expressed by Mr. Liddell and others. The council is working very hard. In one week, it held four meetings. The council often starts work early in the morning and does not stop until late at night.

### Maintaining the Shanghai Black Market Exchange Rate A Decision Not To Abandon Adequate Stabilization Fund Maintaining Is Easy

The Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, having obtained a $50 million foreign exchange loan from the United States and a £5 million foreign exchange loan from the United Kingdom to maintain China's exchange rate, finds it very easy to do so. The equalization fund, calculated at the current exchange rate, amounts to 1.5 billion yuan, which is sufficient to maintain the statutory exchange rate, supply the legitimate needs of various industries as much as possible, and maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate. Shanghai, as the economic center of China, has a neutral concession status, which is slightly different from other occupied areas. Therefore, it has been decided to continue to maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate, while making every effort to prevent arbitrage and strictly reviewing the use of foreign exchange. There is no intention to abandon maintaining the Shanghai black market. Legitimate merchants can request foreign exchange for the import of essential goods in accordance with the law. The Chinese government can supply commercial foreign exchange that is higher than the Shanghai black market, which is clear evidence that the Chinese government is protecting the interests of legitimate merchants, so that they can be protected from the losses of the black market.

### More Than 10,000 Tons of Coal Dust Arrives

There were reports that two coal-carrying ships had long ago set sail from the production area, but had not yet arrived, and were feared to have been lost, resulting in two more ships being unable to set sail. The price of coal and coal balls was therefore raised again, and the rush to produce them for the market resulted in crude and unusable products. It has now been proven that the above news is inaccurate. According to a certain coal merchant yesterday, the "Fushou" ship had arrived yesterday at port, berthed in the Huangpu River. The ship was carrying 5,500 tons of Gubart coal dust. Also, the "Mingyang" ship had arrived yesterday afternoon, carrying 6,500 tons of Keelung coal dust.

### Prohibition of Tung Seedling Exports

The Ministry of Finance telegraphed all customs offices to open, permitting the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to consult, stating that Brazil is currently promoting the planting of tung trees, which will inevitably affect the promotion of our country's tung oil in overseas markets. It is proposed to request that all customs offices be instructed to strictly prohibit the export of tung oil seeds and tung oil branches from this country, in order to benefit the foreign sales of tung oil and prevent market competition. After investigation, tung oil seeds have already been prohibited from export together with tung fruit and tung kernels, and a general order has been issued for compliance. In order to prevent tung seedlings from being transplanted overseas, all tung oil branches should be strictly prohibited from export. It is ordered that this be complied with.

### Power Company Adopts Absolutely Fair Method for Reducing Electricity Most Users Unaffected

The "Times" reports that Mr. Feller, Vice President of the Shanghai Power Company, explained yesterday the temporary measures implemented by the company to reduce electricity before the Electricity Distribution Committee of the Municipal Council completed its research. It is said that this method is absolutely fair, and all users will be involved in rotation, and the same fair method will be adopted when it is cancelled in the future. The personnel sent out by the company to record the electricity meters go to the users' premises according to the calendar to record the meters. Once all the recording is completed, the users will be formally notified of the electricity to be reduced. There are currently more than 100,000 electricity meters in the Public Concession. Due to accounting issues and manpower shortages, it is impossible to complete the recording immediately. At the current rate, 4,000 households can be recorded every day. Fortunately, most users use less than 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month, so they will not be affected.

### Two People Jointly Establish Hardware Store Dispute Over Accounts Wu Xinhai Accused of Embezzlement

Wu Xinhai, from Ningbo, residing at No. 9, Lane 195, McGonigal Road, previously partnered with Xu Yecheng at Wan Tai Hardware Store, No. 540 Ningbo Road. Later, due to the development of the business, a branch was established in Chongqing. At that time, Wu and Xu went to Chongqing together to manage everything. Later, Wu Xinhai returned to Shanghai to handle the Shanghai store's affairs. Recently, Xu suddenly claimed that Wu had embezzled a loan of 17,500 yuan, and telegraphed his wife, Xu Xiaomeizi, to hire lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to report to the Xin Zha Police Station, which dispatched detective Ma Zhongrong to arrest Wu and bring him to the First Special Court for interrogation. He was released on bail pending trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu ascended the bench to continue the interrogation. The defendant hired lawyers Chen Xingmin and Zheng Wenkai to appear in court and stated that the defendant, Wu Xinhai, had previously been involved in a civil lawsuit with Xu Yecheng over the settlement of accounts in the Civil Court. Because Xu was far away in Chongqing and the account books had not been handed over, Judge Tao advised him to withdraw the lawsuit temporarily. Now, the defendant has 24 boxes of hardware, worth more than 20,000 yuan, which he was planning to ship, but this case suddenly occurred, so he stopped the shipment. It is not embezzlement. The court ordered the case to be postponed for seven days, instructing both parties to try to reach a settlement outside the court before further consideration.

### Suicide Due to Business Losses

A lodger surnamed Chen, a local resident, 44 years old, suddenly committed suicide by drinking a bottle of liquid in Room 20 of the Zhongshan Hotel at No. 480 Tianjin Road the night before last. It was not until around 3:00 AM yesterday morning that a tea boy discovered him, already dead. It was found that Chen was an employee of the Heji Coal Company on Peng Road. Because he had used up the guest account and could not make up for it, he resorted to this desperate measure.

### Fire on Rue Chapsal

Jiang Lian'gen, from Jiangbei, residing at No. 4, Lane 300, Rue Chapsal, French Concession, made a living by renting out rickshaws. At 6:48 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in Jiang's house. Immediately, flames spread everywhere, reaching the roof. After the fire brigade learned of the fire, it rushed to the scene and extinguished it after an hour. In addition to the complete destruction of the house at No. 4, the two neighboring houses at No. 3 and No. 5 were also destroyed. When the fire was raging, Jiang woke up and quickly saved his only three-month-old daughter, resulting in both father and daughter being burned by the fire. Afterwards, an ambulance was called to send them to the hospital for treatment.

### Lost Children Awaiting Collection

The French police found three lost children in the concession on the 7th of this month. They are currently being temporarily cared for by the police station. It is hoped that their families will come to claim them as soon as possible. The names of the three children are listed below: (1) Zhu Zhenbao (9 years old, from Changshu, female); (2) Tu Xiudi (13 years old, from Fenghua, female); (3) Zhang Ahuan (10 years old, from Shaoxing, male).

### Letter

To the Editor,

Having recently read an article in your newspaper on March 19 regarding the Yuan Chang Yarn Company fraud case, it involved our bank, stating that "the Fu Kang Bank had 8,660 yuan that had not been withdrawn, and immediately notified them to suspend payment. The bank agreed. However, when the court's order to stop payment arrived in the afternoon, the money had already been withdrawn." Upon investigation, the money was our bank's cashier's check, which was cleared on February 25. The court order was relayed through our association on the 26th, and the money could no longer be stopped. Our bank reported the situation to the association, which was forwarded to the court. All the sections published in your newspaper clearly differ from the facts and are believed to be based on inaccurate rumors. We hope you will correct this.

Sincerely,
Fu Kang Bank, March 19, 1941

### The Heart of Separation

— Mo Zi

Tonight, I finished teaching him English, and he thanked me as he said goodbye. Only then did I remember that today was the "last lesson" of his learning stage. Tomorrow he will leave here and change to another job. Because of the distance, he has been reading English for several months, but now he has to interrupt it.

I sent him downstairs and asked him for the address of his new home, saying that I would visit him when I had time. He thanked me humbly, all the way to the door, letting the sound stay in the dark alley. My heart felt empty, as if I couldn't bear this simple separation, and I deeply remembered the past.

Half a year ago, Pei came every night to read English for an hour, and had continued reading for three months without interruption. Her progress was rapid. When she was about to finish reading the second book, she said to me:

"Soon I will leave here and go to a very far place to live a happy life." I knew she was a lively and enthusiastic child, and she often told me that she couldn't stand the silence here and wanted to live a meaningful life. I first expressed my approval of her actions, and then said to her:

"When you leave, you won't have nightly homework anymore. I feel very lonely."

"No, I'll introduce you to..." A happy smile appeared on her innocent face. I suspected she was joking with me, so I said:

"Don't joke, if you suddenly stop doing something you're used to doing every day, don't you feel lonely?"

"Who's joking with you, it's true. I'll introduce you to an apprentice, he wants to read English. When I leave, you can ask him to come and read every day, and you won't feel lonely." Her words were both serious and light.

So she told me again that she often bought things in that shop, and gradually became acquainted with that apprentice. Recently, he asked her if there was any place where he could get English tutoring, so she took this opportunity to introduce him to me.

The next day, she brought the apprentice, sixteen or seventeen years old, short in stature, with a dark face. He had attended elementary school, and had come to Shanghai as an apprentice three years ago. He was worried about burying his future while being immersed in oil, soy sauce, wine, and vinegar all day long, so he was looking for another job and wanted to read a little English.

Pei left, and I sent her to the door, blessing her bright future. A heart of separation pressed heavily on me, but I didn't feel empty, I could still get fulfillment in the nightly homework.

He also came to read for an hour every night, and I taught him with the same enthusiasm.

Several times a day I had to pass by that shop. If it was a slack time in the business, I always saw him holding a book and reading. Although there wasn't a continuous stretch of time for him to read, his recitation, new words, and explanations were all done very well. Under the heavy pressure of life, his desire for knowledge was particularly strong, so his progress was particularly fast, and his ability to accept was far beyond that of a junior high school student.

Three months passed, and the first book was about to be finished. Pei also asked about him in her letters, and said that she was living very well there. I told him that Pei had asked about his studies. He was very moved when he heard this and said:

"Please thank her for her kindness. Soon I will go to work in a factory, the location is very far from here, and I'm afraid I won't be able to continue reading English. Please tell her that too." I felt very surprised, but I still calmly taught him the last few days, and he listened with extra care.

Tonight, he thanked me sincerely, and I was ashamed that I hadn't helped him get much in the past three months. I asked him about the factory, and he happily said that life was more regulated than in the store, and he could study on his own at night. I was delighted that he could use his hands to push the wheel of life from now on, and also push the wheel of the world.

The feeling of separation tonight made me feel the sorrow of loneliness, and I nervously recalled the past six months. I hope that their future and life will be meaningful, and that my empty heart left here can still be fulfilled.

### One Day

— Yu Yunzuo

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(5) The Division Between Love and Desire

He supported his chin with his right hand, staring blankly at the two swords hanging on the wall; the heavy snoring coming from the next room told him that Zhao Si and the actor Li Yuzhen had gone into the black and sweet countryside without any worries. The running around and disputes of the past few days, although they had made him feel equally tired, sleep was absolutely impossible until he had finished writing this letter.

"Having had the honor of meeting you these days, it has been the greatest joy of my life; and your fairy-like appearance, jade-like bones, and wise heart are especially what I infinitely admire..."

The third sheet of paper seemed to be going smoothly, but after rereading the first paragraph, he felt that it was absolutely unusable; such nauseating sentences were what those adoring actors were used to, and what he hated the most. After all, he was still a man, still an actor, and even he couldn't help but get goosebumps when he saw it. How could he offend a dignified and noble woman like Luo Xiangqi?

As soon as Qiu Haitang thought about this, the third sheet of paper was crumpled into a ball again and sent into the wastepaper basket.

Seeing that a very thick pad of stationery was almost half torn away, his tired brain finally showed him a miracle, allowing him to write the following short note in a matter of three or four minutes: — the plan for a long letter was ultimately abandoned.

"I am deeply grateful for your help in this matter, for which I have no way to express my gratitude. All disputes are expected to be resolved within days, but before returning to Beijing, I have something I wish to tell you and would like to meet for a talk (at your residence or elsewhere). Please do not refuse, and I pray that you will reply at your earliest convenience! Yours sincerely, Wu Jun"

In this way, he felt very satisfied. Although he really had no experience in pursuing women, he also knew from common sense that it would be cleaner and more straightforward to attack directly from the front rather than circling around. He thought that if the other party really had no interest, he would know if she just didn't reply.

"Perhaps she doesn't know who Wu Jun is?" After sealing the envelope, he hesitated again, because Wu Jun was the name he had given himself, and few outsiders knew it, but Qiu Haitang really didn't want to use his stage name or the three characters Wu Yuqin to communicate with Luo Xiangqi, so he still used it; according to his speculation, with so many handkerchiefs and a bottle of perfume being sent at the same time, plus Luo Xiangqi's intelligence, she should be able to guess who "Wu Jun" was.

War

### Mosquito Warships

— Jin Chun

The United States Navy recently manufactured a batch of Mosquito warships. These are small, exquisite armored warships, 70 feet long. Because they have an extremely shallow draft, they can freely pass through torpedo blockades, and even if they launch torpedoes, there is nothing to be done about them. Their equipment is also extremely complete, equipped with four torpedo launch tubes, two anti-aircraft guns, six underwater bomb launchers, and smoke screen equipment.

Mosquito warships have extremely high speeds and long sailing distances, with a speed of 50 miles per hour, and a maximum sailing distance of over 2,000 miles. They are very flexible to operate, and can be maneuvered as needed. Among all ships, only Mosquito warships can perform the kind of sideslip sailing that airplanes do. In addition, because the ship is small, it is very difficult for airplanes to bomb or strafe them with machine guns.

Mosquito warships have more combat power than torpedo destroyers, but cost far less than torpedo destroyers. Even if there are losses, the number of crew members is less than one-tenth of the number of people driving a torpedo destroyer. With smoke screen cover, they are unlikely to hit mines. If a submarine surfaces, it will be sunk by warships. Mosquito warships are light and flexible, and when maneuvered properly, they can defeat large warships.

The United States Navy is now working hard to improve and manufacture these Mosquito warships, and even touts them as era-defining new weapons.

Society

### Not Defaulting on Debts

— Fang Shaohui

According to the American Bank Monthly Report, a recent, interesting, and valuable statistic was obtained from a well-known university regarding "bad debts" among Americans. This statistic is categorized by the nature of individuals' occupations. According to the "law of large numbers" in statistics, we can discern the general level of responsibility and morality within various occupational fields, serving as a reference for extending credit.

The following percentages represent the number of people per hundred who do not default on their debts:

Office Clerks……92%

Retailers……89%

Teachers……86%

### The "China Travel" Company's Last Stand

— Shou Wu

It is said that the China Traveling Theater Company is regrouping and will perform "Hong Xuanjiao" at the Lyceum Theatre starting on the 14th of next month. Yesterday, they hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Guangming Cafe.

The "China Travel" company has been around for eight or nine years. In terms of achievements, it can be considered significant. The rise and consolidation of the spoken drama movement in Shanghai was largely due to the long-term performances of "China Travel" when they first came to Shanghai. At that time, "China Travel" was truly powerful. "Thunderstorm," which is now a "seasonal play," shook Shanghai because of "China Travel's" performance. However, good times don't last. Later, "China Travel" seemed to be gradually aging, personnel disputes became increasingly complex, and the spirit of work was not as good as before. Eventually, a collective action occurred in Hong Kong where more than ten members left the group. After much difficulty, they arrived in Shanghai and found a foothold at the Xuan Palace. They struggled to perform for fourteen months, but at the end of February, the Tianfeng Company suddenly took over the Xuan Palace. Thus, this first professional spoken drama troupe in China, with a considerable history, had to say goodbye to the Xuan Palace in tears and find their own way out.

We don't have to shy away from the fact that there were some points of conflict between Tang Huaiqiu and his daughter Tang Ruoqing. The conflict between Tang Ruoqing and Tang Huaiqiu, the "soul" of the family, backstage during the revival of "Hua Mulan" was a concrete manifestation of this. After "China Travel" stopped performing, rumors spread that Tang Huaiqiu would retire and that Tang Ruoqing would be in charge of "China Travel." However, father and daughter are, after all, blood relatives. When external crises outweighed internal conflicts, the united front of the father and daughter was easily formed. Thus, they went around, with Tang Huaiqiu contacting theaters and Tang Ruoqing appealing to Wei Ruhui and Fei Mu to serve as playwrights and directors. The precarious fate of "China Travel" was revived.

Yesterday's banquet for reporters at the Guangming Cafe was "China Travel's" formal expression of regrouping to the outside world. At the same time, to prove the accuracy of their "official report," they also invited Wei Ruhui and Fei Mu to attend.

Moving or Fleeing?

After everyone was seated, the four hosts deferred to each other, and finally, "Director" Tang was nominated to "perform." Tang Huaiqiu's words were very simple. He said, "Just now, an old friend came in and asked me: 'Is China Travel moving?' Speaking of moving, I think it would be more accurate to say fleeing. When Jin Shan and Wang Ying were on a mobile tour, wherever they went, they changed the name of the play "Put Down Your Whip" to "Fleeing to ××." This time, we are really fleeing. The reason for inviting everyone here for a meal today is very simple, which is that "China Travel" is going to perform again. Please help us a lot."

After his "performance" was over, Tang Ruoqing said, "Dad, you didn't memorize your 'lines' well."

Tang Huaiqiu said, "I'm acting in a prompt book play, there are no 'lines' at all." After thinking for a while, he stood up again to supplement his "performance":

"This time we are performing "Hong Xuanjiao," which is written by Mr. Wei Ruhui and directed by Mr. Fei Mu. Both of these gentlemen are here today."

### Theatrical News

— Jue Xin

Xun Huisheng has arrived in Shanghai and will take the stage at the Golden Grand Theatre starting tomorrow evening (the 21st). According to Sun Lanting, the manager of the theater, the audience has already booked eight hundred seats, which is very reassuring. Huisheng has been away from Shanghai for eight years, and the sensation is naturally expected. As for his opening play, it is still "Hongluanxi." Since he became famous, every time he came to Shanghai to perform, he used this play as his opening play. I remember the last time he came to Shanghai eight years ago, he took the stage at the Tianchan Stage on the first day of the lunar new year.

After Huisheng finishes performing for twenty-four days at the Golden Theatre, he will then perform at the Xinxin Stage. This satisfies both parties who competed for his performance. The Xinxin authorities had several negotiations with Zhang Yipeng regarding Huisheng's performance, asking him to rest temporarily and wait for Huisheng to finish performing before taking the stage. Yipeng was originally unwilling to accept this request, but due to the relationship, after several compromises, he agreed.

During the break period, Yipeng actively rehearsed the second volume of "Journey to the West" and took this opportunity to clean up the backstage, removing the dross and preserving the essence, so that the second volume of "Journey to the West" could be staged with a perfect cast. As for the script of the second volume, it is being revised by Wei Ruhui, but it has not yet been finalized.

The Xinxin Stage gave Yipeng a fixed fee of three thousand yuan during the break period, but he also received a share of the profits earned during Huisheng's performance. This is probably a new record for a "fixed fee."

Someone suggested inviting the playwright and director to "perform," but they all politely declined.

### The Cast of "Hong Xuanjiao"

In Tang Huaiqiu's report, it was only known that the performance period of "Hong Xuanjiao" would start on the 14th of next month. The number of days of performance and the cast of actors were not mentioned.

According to what I have learned, it is like this: The performance period of "Hong Xuanjiao" is scheduled for nine days. The cast of actors is roughly decided as follows:

Hong Xuanjiao (Tang Ruoqing) Hong Xiuquan (Tang Huaiqiu) Shi Dakai (Shao Hua) Li Xiucheng (Zhao Shu) Yang Xiuqing (Qiu Quan) Wei Changhui (Liao Fan) Xiao Sanniang (Wang Wei) Hong Fu (Ge Xin) In this cast, Gong Jiabao has no role, Huang He has joined the United Troupe, and Shi Hui has been admitted to the Shanghai Drama Society, and Sun Jinglu's whereabouts are unknown, so she also has no role.

### Hopes for "China Travel"

This theater incident was a blow and also a stimulus to China Travel. However, adversity builds a nation, as the saying goes. From now on, since the Tang family father and daughter have formed a united front, they should work hard and it should not be difficult to restore their past glory. However, everything depends on human effort. It is also hoped that they will take more care, especially in terms of the repertoire. Do not repeatedly "rehash old rice" by always performing the same old plays such as "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," "The Wilderness," and "New Mello Fragrance," because audiences are always seeing these same plays. From the perspective of "China Travel" itself, this is also a mistake in business.

"China Travel" has a long history of eight or nine years, has experienced hardship, and has finally persevered. This time is another last stand. Although they are all veteran generals who have been through many battles, they must not be careless. We sincerely hope that "China Travel" can strive for progress and restore its past glory. An army grieving for its losses will surely be victorious. We also pray that this "Hong Xuanjiao" can achieve a triumphant start.

### Brief Report on "Boom Town"

"Boom Town" is a blockbuster produced by MGM with all its efforts. There are as many as five major stars starring in it. In addition to Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Claudette Colbert, and Hedy Lamarr, there is also the film veteran Frank Morgan. Its lineup can be said to be quite strong.

This film was shot for ten weeks, costing one million US dollars, with twenty-seven exterior scenes and five intense battle scenes. The story tells the story of the American oil field exploitation, weaving in the love of men and women and the loyalty of friends. The plot is tortuous and stimulating.

In order to make the oil well's blowout look realistic, a special oil pool was dug, with a volume of 300,000 gallons of kerosene. Huge water pumps were installed. Initially, it was planned to use oozing syrup instead of kerosene, but the local residents strongly opposed it because the sweet water would breed mosquitoes. The company had to use real kerosene to shoot the film.

This film will be screened at the Grand China Theatre starting this Saturday. The seat prices have been slightly increased. It can be said to be another blockbuster after "Gone with the Wind."

### Chapter 3: Makes One Remember Lord Pingyuan

Zhang Cangqiu, burning with anger, chased him here, fearing nothing and only seeking a fight. Now, seeing that this young man named Li spoke very reasonably and had no arrogance, he had to put down his treasured sword and replied, "My surname is Zhang, my name is Cangqiu. I came from Jigong Mountain. Just now, I stayed overnight at the home of a newly acquainted friend, Xu Jing. Both the treasured sword and the treasured horse are my beloved possessions. That Xu, also has a treasured sword. We exchanged it to look at it, but unexpectedly, someone was secretly watching and wanted to take the opportunity to steal it. Think about it, such precious things, how can they be easily stolen by others? I and Xu Jing chased after him together, but unexpectedly, this man named Chen used a hidden weapon to knock Xu Jing down. Because I could not bear to abandon the enemy, I chased him all the way here." After Li Xin heard Zhang Cangqiu's words, he asked, "Brave Zhang, is the Xu Jing you are talking about a young scholar?" Zhang Cangqiu nodded and said, "Exactly. He was injured, and I haven't gone to see him yet." Li Xin hurriedly said, "That's bad, that Xu Qing is also my friend. I don't know if his injury is serious? Let's go see him quickly." Zhang Cangqiu said, "That's right." Then he followed Li Xin, opened the garden gate, and walked out of the village. Chen Fei and the family members also lit lanterns and torches and walked towards the road they came from. After walking a short distance, they saw a dark figure sitting by the roadside. Everyone ran over and looked at it by the light of the lanterns. It was Xu Jing. Xu Jing was very surprised when he saw Zhang Cangqiu and Li Xin coming, and the horse thief was also among them. Zhang Cangqiu and Li Xin both stepped forward and asked him where he was injured and how he was feeling now. Xu Jing replied, "My injury is still light. Fortunately, the arrowhead did not go deep and I pulled it out. I tore a small piece of cloth from my lapel and tied it myself, so it stopped bleeding. However, I almost fainted when I fell just now. By the time I got up, Brave Zhang was gone, so I'm still sitting here resting, not going back. How did you run here with Brother Li?" Li Xin laughed and said, "This is called no acquaintance without a fight." Then he briefly told him about Zhang Cangqiu chasing Chen Fei to his village. Xu Jing also said, "How coincidental, how coincidental." Because Chen Fei had injured Xu Jing with a hidden weapon, although people did not blame him, he felt a little sorry in his heart, so he came over to apologize to Xu Jing. (16)

### The Philosophy of a Striving Life

The fruit of striving is not the final step of striving, but the foundation of the second stage, that is, the cause of the second stage of striving. Cause becomes fruit, and fruit becomes cause. Cause and effect are interconnected, and in fact, it is impossible to distinguish which one is the cause and which one is the fruit, and striving becomes an endless process of progress. (Zong Yu)
