### With Eager Attention from America, Awaiting the Development of the Far Eastern Situation; Japan Plans to Resume Talks with the US Within a Week; Britain Prepares to Fulfill its Promise to Fully Assist the US

United Press, Washington, 20th - American officials yesterday maintained close contact with developments in the Far East, but stated that it is difficult to predict how the situation will unfold before the policies of the new Japanese cabinet are announced. The State Department continues its "wait-and-see" policy, and diplomatically suggests that Japan should adopt the same attitude. This indicates that a period of diplomatic negotiations is about to begin. Diplomatic observers say that Japanese leaders will do their best to avoid military conflict with the United States, but do not believe that the Japanese government will abandon its expansion plans to the south or north. Most experts express doubts as to whether Japan will take action against Siberia soon. Officials say that if Japan takes action, the United States can still impose additional economic and financial restrictions on Japan if necessary. These steps will include: (1) completely cutting off the supply of unrefined oil and other goods still exported to Japan from the United States; (2) completely freezing Japanese funds in the United States; (3) the United States will issue a blacklist in Latin America and the Philippines against businesses related to Japanese people; (4) the United States can expel Japanese consular officials. These officials acknowledge that Japan can retaliate against these measures, but the United States has not yet indicated whether it will implement these sanctions.

Reuters, Washington, 20th - Official circles here are still watching the situation in the Far East with eager attention. The lack of immediate major changes in Japanese policy and the continuation of US-Japan talks have indeed brought some comfort, but it is widely believed that future actions will depend on the development of the war situation. Some members of Congress are now advocating a firm stance. Senator Norris publicly stated, "We cannot appease Japan, just as we cannot appease Hitler." At the same time, Senator Gillette viewed the Navy Department's order for American merchant ships in the Pacific to return to domestic ports as a sign that the authorities consider a US-Japan understanding to be hopeless.

United Press, Tokyo, 20th - The Japanese Jiji Shimpo published a commentary in its midday edition today stating that Japanese policy cannot be swayed by other countries. It also said that the current cabinet is not more militarized than the previous cabinet, and hinted that General Tojo may not abandon the US-Japan talks initiated by Konoe, but may use other explorations and plans. Authoritative sources have confirmed that the new government will resume talks with the United States within a week.

London, 19th - The emergence of the new Tojo cabinet in Japan has not shaken the firm attitude of the British side in the slightest. Well-informed sources here believe that the Tojo cabinet is an extremely pro-Axis and pro-aggression cabinet. Japan's decision to appoint an army officer as prime minister is enough to show that the navy has retreated to a non-essential position (it is generally believed that the Japanese navy is more stable than the army). Therefore, the British side should be closely vigilant. An official warned Japan: (1) the definite limit of compromise has already been exceeded; (2) Britain will never sit idly by while Japan seizes the entire Pacific; (3) Churchill said that once a war breaks out in the Pacific, Britain will fully cooperate with the United States in the war. The British side is now fully prepared to fulfill this promise. (4) If Japan attacks Vladivostok, Britain will consider it equivalent to attacking Deauville in the UK. British public opinion is also unanimously supporting the above-mentioned stance, and advocating a clear warning to Japan stating that if it attacks Siberia or implements southward expansion, then the US, Britain, China, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union will take joint action. Only in this way can Japan heed our warning, and the common interests and security of all countries can be preserved.

Tojo Calls for Unity, Japanese Cabinet to Meet Tomorrow

Reuters, Tokyo, 20th - Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo today issued a departmental order to the personnel of the Ministry of the Army, calling on the military and civilians to unite strongly to respond to the "foreign encirclement suffered by Japan." He said that the nation is now at a crossroads of life and death, and encouraged the personnel of the Ministry of the Army to prepare to sacrifice everything to overcome the current crisis. Tojo also said that he was deeply moved to be ordered to form a cabinet at this time, while also holding the leadership of the army. The progress of Japan's military build-up program in the past year is very satisfactory.

United Press, Tokyo, 20th - Prime Minister Tojo Hideki visited the Ise Grand Shrine yesterday after assuming his new position, and returned to Tokyo by plane in the afternoon to take office in the new cabinet. The hasty trip to the Ise Grand Shrine is considered to be quite noteworthy, because the new prime minister usually visits the shrine leisurely two weeks after taking office.

Reuters, Tokyo, 20th - The first action of the new Prime Minister Tojo after taking office as Minister of Home Affairs was the complete replacement of all major positions in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. It is generally believed that Tojo may have plans to thoroughly reform bureaucratic politics before implementing his new programs.

Reuters, Tokyo, 20th - According to well-informed observers here, if the US-Japan talks in Washington ultimately prove ineffective, then Japan will inevitably advance southward. It is estimated that Tojo will give the US-Japan talks a final stimulus before the talks break down. Although the new cabinet members seem to be moderate on the surface, the main cabinet members do have continental ambitions, which cannot be ignored. The handover procedures between the new and old prime ministers have not yet been officially completed, because former Prime Minister Konoe is currently ill. It is expected that the first regular meeting of the new cabinet will be held on October 22. Araki Sadao, a member of the Supreme Military Administration Council, published an article calling on the people to abandon the idea of relying on aid from other countries, saying that the Japanese people should rise up and overcome the current difficulties themselves. The right-wing military political party Toowa-kai also published an article asking the new government to quickly implement Japan's national policy.

United Press, Tokyo, 20th - The Yomiuri Shimbun said today that General Tojo Hideki concurrently serving as Prime Minister, Army Minister, and Minister of Home Affairs is unprecedented in Japanese history. The new government has resolved to implement Japan's unchanging policy, which is to successfully resolve the "China Incident" and establish the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The newspaper believes that this transmits "various possible peaceful measures," and also said, "If the United States abandons the US-British-Chinese-Dutch encirclement of Japan and cooperates with Japan, then the peace in the Pacific that the United States is eagerly talking about can be surely maintained."

Japanese Navy Minister Declares Preparedness to Cope with Contingencies

United Press, Tokyo, 20th - The new Navy Minister, Admiral Shimada Shigetaro, delivered a radio address to the nation yesterday, saying that the Japanese Navy is prepared to cope with any changes in the world situation. Shimada said that if the Navy and Army maintain close cooperation, and the people are willing to endure all difficulties, then Japan will surely achieve the strongest position.

Reuters, Tokyo, 20th - The Japan Times, the organ of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an editorial today that the route through Vladivostok for US aid to the Soviet Union contains the danger of extending the war to East Asia. If US-Japan relations remain as tense as they are now, then US aid to the Soviet Union beyond the point will definitely worsen the situation in the Pacific. If the United States is willing to provide effective and full assistance to the Soviet Union, then the improvement of Pacific relations is necessary for the United States. This adjustment of relations must be based on a correct understanding of Japan's policy for the East Asian peace mechanism. If the United States wants to effectively aid the Soviet Union and send aid goods through the Pacific to Vladivostok, then it should know the importance of a friendly Japan.

Reuters, London, 20th - According to the views of well-informed people here, the tense situation in the Far East, although sharpened again as a result of Tojo's appointment as Japanese Prime Minister, does not seem to be in immediate danger of breaking out.

### President Roosevelt Plans to Expand Lend-Lease Aid to the Soviet Union; British Workers Demand the Opening of a New Battlefield

United Press, Hyde Park, 20th - President Roosevelt received the first report yesterday on the tripartite conference held in Moscow. Hopkins presented the President with a preliminary report drafted by US representative Harriman. Harriman is scheduled to go to the White House on Thursday to report to President Roosevelt in person. At the same time, according to unofficial speculation here, the President is planning to extend the Lend-Lease Act to aid the Soviet Union, in order to urgently transport supplies to the besieged Red Army.

United Press, London, 20th - Two thousand worker representatives met yesterday to discuss war production. The main points were: (1) war factories are full of suspicion, believing that the government is sitting idly by and letting the Soviet Union collapse; (2) demanding the opening of a second front. Conference Chairman Swanson said that the workers in every factory are deeply surprised that the government is not fully advancing with the Soviet Union, and it is necessary to publicly declare that the factories are full of suspicion that the government is sitting idly by and letting the Soviet Union collapse, and believe that the reason why the second front has not been established is that Halifax, Moore-Brabazon, Maunsergh and others hold important positions in the cabinet. He said, "We warn the government that the workers will never allow the Soviet Union to collapse, because if it does, we will collapse with it."

Reuters, London, 20th - Economic Warfare Minister Dalton said yesterday in Durham County that within a week of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Allied ships were already carrying urgently needed supplies to the Soviet Union. From the first day of the German attack on the Soviet Union four months ago, the British government has been giving its full support to the Soviet Union with supplies. The Economic Warfare Department, together with the War Transport Department, has been working on non-military supplies. In the first three months of the Soviet-German war, the British side has supplied a huge amount of rubber, tin, aluminum, lead, hemp, steel, and wool, as well as millions of pairs of leather shoes. However, for the benefit of both Britain and the Soviet Union, the details of Britain's assistance to the Soviet Union are not convenient to announce, but the British government will always meet the needs of the Soviet Union to the greatest possible extent. This can be stated clearly.

Reuters, London, 20th - A general assembly of women was held in London yesterday, where the wife of the Soviet ambassador Maisky received gifts from the British side to the Red Army. 25,000 British labor and professional women signed a book guaranteeing all possible assistance to British-Soviet mutual aid. When accepting the gift, Mrs. Maisky said, "We have many difficulties, but we are absolutely convinced that although we are temporarily suffering setbacks, the final victory will surely belong to us."

Reuters, Melbourne, 20th - When the executive members of the Australian Council of Trade Unions met at the end of the week, they advocated that workers' organizations in Pacific coastal countries send representatives to hold a meeting to consider a common policy towards the Soviet Union, and for the same purpose, the Australian Federal Labor Advisory Committee should meet as soon as possible.

### Cuba Asks Spain to Recall Intelligence Attaché

Reuters, Havana, 20th - The Cuban Secretary of State has now asked the Spanish government to recall González, the intelligence attaché stationed in Havana, because the attaché's Fascist activities and propaganda are in conflict with Cuba's foreign policy and national interests.

### Iraq Notifies Japan of Severing Trade Relations

United Press, Cairo, 20th - Reliable sources say that Iraq has decided to sever trade relations with Japan. These sources say that this decision has been formally notified to Japan, and Japanese trade groups have been asked to leave the country.

### US Armed Merchant Ship Case to Be Passed Quickly by the Senate; US Senators Advocate Immediate Retaliation for the Attack on the Destroyer Kearny

United Press, Washington, 20th - Senator Connally, a Democratic Senator from Texas and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for American sailors and fleets to engage in "shoot-on-sight" action early this morning before the committee meeting to retaliate for the "murder" of the US destroyer Kearny. Connally predicted that after the Navy Department announced the news that eleven people were missing and ten were injured, the Senate would quickly pass the pending bill on arming merchant ships. According to Connally, the committee he chaired was originally scheduled to discuss routine matters this morning, but the Kearny incident and the extremists' attempt to force the Senate to vote on a declaration of war turned this meeting into a special meeting. Connally declared that the Kearny attack must be retaliated. Our country's warships should sink all German submarines in the fortified sea. House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bloom said that the Kearny attack is enough to show that the Germans, whether on land or at sea, are doing senseless things regardless of life and property. Representative McCormack, a Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, said that the Kearny attack was obviously a threatening action by the German government in response to the change of cabinet in Japan, and intended to oppress the United States in both oceans.

Reuters, Washington, 20th - The Navy Department announced today that the US destroyer Kearny, which was recently attacked by a submarine, has now arrived in a certain port, but the name of the port has not been announced. It is said that the ship was attacked by a submarine, undoubtedly German, early Friday morning. According to the report received from the ship, eleven crew members are missing and two are seriously injured. In addition, there are eight people with minor injuries, but none are in danger. The injured have been sent to the hospital, and the families of the missing have been notified.

### Workers at US Bell Plant Prepare to Strike

Reuters, Buffalo, New York, 20th - The United Auto Workers here have voted to take strike action against the Bell Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Buffalo and Niagara Falls, but will not strike temporarily while the Arbitration Board is still trying to mediate. If this labor unrest is realized, 10,500 workers manufacturing military aircraft will be affected. Bell Aircraft Company is contracted by Britain and the United States to build approximately $150 million worth of aircraft.

### New Zealand Prime Minister Declares Determination to Cooperate with the Six Powers to Maintain Civilization and Traditional Freedom; Singapore to Evacuate Coastal Residents

Reuters, Wellington, 20th - New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser spoke on the Pacific issue last night, saying, "We do not want war, but if a Pacific war still breaks out despite our best efforts to avoid it, then the government and people of New Zealand can only face this situation with faith and composure. The people of New Zealand will never let down their compatriots in England and compatriots overseas, nor will they betray our goals and traditional freedoms. New Zealand must be prepared to cooperate in various ways with Britain, Australia, the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, China, the Soviet Union, and the United States to maintain peace in the Pacific."

Reuters, Singapore, 20th - Complete arrangements have now been made here to evacuate civilians from the east and west coast areas of Singapore once an emergency occurs. This plan can be implemented immediately. The authorities have issued instructions separately, requiring those who are able to arrange their own accommodation during the evacuation, and those who are unable to register and enter government shelters. The authorities also issued a warning to follow the road designated by the authorities during the evacuation and not to panic, because everyone has sufficient time to seek refuge in a safe place.

Reuters, Singapore, 20th - The Singapore Free Press quoted Air Vice-Marshal Pulford, commander of the British Air Force in the Far East, as saying that since the British Air Force has completely controlled the skies in the Middle East, it will also be able to deal with the Japanese army in the Far East in the same way. The Japanese Air Force should not be underestimated, but today's British Air Force in the Far East has excellent aircraft and pilots, and is excellent in both personnel and equipment, which is not only sufficient to defend Malaya, but also sufficient to carry out various necessary offensive actions to gain an advantage in controlling the skies. He is very satisfied with this.

Reuters, Melbourne, 20th - When Australia solicited public bonds yesterday, 97 merchants purchased a total of £200,000 by phone and telegraph within two hours.

### German Troops Reach the Outskirts of Moscow, Red Army Prepares for a Head-on Blow, German Army in Donets River Basin Suffers Heavy Losses, Soviet Counterattack in Orel Causes Many Enemy Casualties

United Press, London, 20th - Moscow and its surrounding areas have been placed under martial law. The Soviet people are vowing to defend Moscow to the "last drop of blood." Every street and house is being fortified with strong defenses, ready to meet the German troops advancing eastward, who have already reached sixty miles from the city. Moscow Radio quoted Pravda's commentary on the martial law decree, saying that Hitler has driven his main forces to attack Moscow, southwest of Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets. The commentary stated, "The enemy's attacks have not ceased to this day, and our heroic warriors have already blunted their edge. However, the enemy continues to send reinforcements repeatedly, as Hitler's desire to seize Moscow is increasingly urgent. This martial law order will mobilize the entire population to defend Moscow. We have built strong defenses in and around Moscow, prepared for a fierce battle, and have decided to use all possible means, even street fighting, to resist the enemy. Every anti-aircraft gunner, every tank crew member, every aviator will each guard their post. The people also welcome these plans and recognize their importance. From now on, any spies and special envoys of the fascists will be shown no mercy and will be wiped out. The National Defense Committee has instructed the people to obey orders, remain calm, and give the Red Army their full assistance. We have vowed to fight for the Soviet capital and are determined to defend Moscow to the last drop of blood. Long live Moscow! Long live our country!"

Reuters, London, 20th - A Moscow spokesperson broadcasted last night that fierce battles continue in the Kalinin region, one hundred miles northwest of Moscow, where Soviet troops under Kamenko are launching counterattacks. Every inch of land and every rafter of a house is being contested. Soviet forces have established an impregnable line of defense in the Kalinin area to resist German tanks. It is expected that even more intense blood battles will occur. Another Soviet broadcast stated that the German army's attacks on the Soviet forces in the Donets River basin have not succeeded and have instead suffered heavy losses. Yesterday, Moscow Radio also reported that the Soviet army's counterattack in the Orel region, one hundred miles southwest of Moscow, was successful. On Saturday and Sunday, the German army in the Orel region attacked several sections of the front line in an attempt to advance, but the Soviet army there repelled the German attacks with small special forces and counterattacked several times, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On Sunday morning, a German team attempted to force a river crossing in small boats, but was met with a heavy blow from the Soviet army. Many of the small boats capsized or sank, and the rest retreated in disarray.

Reuters, London, 20th - Yesterday's German communiqué boasted that the Soviet army under General Timoshenko had been annihilated again. However, a Reuters military correspondent said that the German army does not seem to have approached Moscow any closer. The recent Soviet communiqué stated that there were fierce battles in some areas, and the Soviet army had repelled the German army's fierce attacks. The battle for Moscow has been going on for three weeks now. The Germans claimed that their southern army had advanced along the Sea of Azov and occupied the city of Taganrog. If this is true, then the general expectation that the German army in the south will resume its offensive near the mouth of the Don River has been confirmed.

National Defense Committee Chairman Stalin Decides to Stay in the Soviet Capital to Personally Supervise the Battle

United Press, Moscow, 20th - The vanguard of the German army has penetrated the outer defenses of Moscow and launched a new offensive against Moscow. At the same time, Stalin declared in his order of the day that Moscow will resist to the end, and the Red Army will defend Moscow to the end under Stalin's personal command. Moscow is clearly going to be transformed from a beautiful city into a battlefield. The 4.5 million people in the city will be mixed with tens of millions of fighting German and Soviet soldiers. The order of the day was broadcast on Moscow Radio last night, hours after the official announcement that the German army had penetrated an area of Moscow's outer circle. The radio broadcast stated that Stalin, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Defense Committee, signed the order and indicated that after diplomatic envoys and some government personnel moved to the new capital in the east, he would supervise the battle from the rear. Stalin said that the people of Moscow are extremely calm and will do their best to assist the Red Army in resisting and defending Moscow.

United Press, London, 20th - German armored divisions attacked the largest defensive line surrounding Moscow yesterday, putting the Soviet capital in the most dangerous situation of the war. But Stalin has now personally taken command and says Moscow will not be abandoned. Moscow Radio broadcast that a large number of Red Army troops are going to the outskirts of Moscow to fight, and thousands of Soviet people are also assisting the Red Army in the fighting. The German army also said that new troops have been sent as reinforcements.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 20th - It was reported here yesterday that the Soviet authorities are preparing to defend Moscow to the death. A worker's army battalion was sent to the front line on Saturday. The team was hastily formed on October 1st, all of whom are workers who have never received military training, and most of them are over the age of military service. There are now two defensive circles in Moscow, the inner circle is for close combat with the enemy. The scene in Moscow has completely changed.

Soviet Far East Army Transferred to Central Front to Assist Frontline Soldiers

International News Service, London, 20th - According to information heard here, Moscow Radio reported that powerful Red Army reinforcements, transferred from Siberia and Mongolia, are now arriving in the European part of the Soviet Union to assist Soviet troops on the central front.

Severe Cold in Southern Soviet Union Greatly Hinders German Progress

Reuters, London, 20th - Berlin Radio broadcast last night, admitting that there is also a severe cold in the southern Soviet front, which greatly hinders the German and allied forces. It is said that the fighting is taking place on frozen slippery roads. Despite these obstacles and the particularly strong resistance of the Soviet army, the German army has broken through the Soviet army's strong positions in several places and captured 7,000 Soviet soldiers. On Friday and Saturday, the Soviet army counterattacked several times but was repelled. Soviet troops in the Leningrad area in the north repeatedly launched attacks but were also driven back.

British and American Tanks Arrive on the Soviet Front Line Fascist Army's Fierce Attacks Repelled

Reports from both sides indicate that the battle for Moscow is still fierce. Moscow news said that fresh troops are now being transferred from all over the Soviet Union, and tanks and aircraft supplied by Britain and the United States have now arrived at the front. According to the Soviet midnight communiqué, fighting continued on all fronts on October 19. The fighting was particularly fierce in the Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets areas. The fierce attacks of the German fascist army have been repelled. On October 18, 38 German planes were destroyed, and 17 Soviet planes were also lost.

Newly Equipped Million-Strong Indian Army Prepares to Cross the Border to Protect Soviet Oil Fields

United Press, West Simla, 20th - Neutral military observers declared yesterday that once the Indian Army is equipped, its strength will be sufficient to take action against any first-class military power. One million soldiers have been divided into mechanized, motorized, and infantry units. Once the German army's advance in the Sea of Azov threatens the large oil fields in the east and the British supply routes to the Soviet Union, this batch of soldiers can be sent to the Caucasus to join forces with the Soviet army.

### Chinese Army in Zhengzhou Area Successfully Attacks Shifo, Japanese Counterattack Across from Yichang Fails, Three Japanese Planes Destroyed at Bailuoji

Chongqing - Military News: (1) The Japanese, who invaded southward from Cenhekou and other places southeast of Jiangling on the morning of the 17th, once invaded Huagang. After the Chinese army bravely counterattacked, it recaptured the area on the 18th. The Japanese, unable to support it, were defeated and fled north. The Chinese are now pursuing them. (2) A part of the Japanese across from Yichang launched a counterattack at dawn on the 13th from Moji Mountain and Fanjiakou toward Luojiadahui and Highland 2543, which had been occupied by the Chinese army. After fierce fighting with the Chinese army for a long time, the area was lost and regained. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and were defeated and retreated. (3) A certain unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese and the Japanese airfield at Bailuoji several times in the first ten days of this month, causing heavy losses to the Japanese. On the 12th, the Chinese artillery bombed the Japanese airfield at Bailuoji again, destroying three Japanese planes. At the moment, no Japanese planes are stationed at the airfield.

The Course of the Yichang Battle

Badong - Wu Qiwai, Deputy Commander of the Sixth War Area, told the United Press yesterday that the Battle of Yichang was very important for disrupting the Japanese army's offensive into Hunan. The battle revealed a lot about the Japanese army's defensive works and troop strength in the area. The Chinese army also learned that the lack of artillery and aircraft was a major obstacle, and that their training and equipment were insufficient to engage in chemical warfare. Wu explained to reporters that the Japanese army in the area hid in the mountains. When the Chinese army came to attack, they retreated into the mountains to hold on. Therefore, the Chinese army did not use the strategy that had been used successfully in the Nanning area for the first time, that is, not to attack the Japanese army's outposts or fortresses, but to attack their supply lines. As a result, the Japanese army either abandoned an area to assist the area under attack, or completely evacuated the area due to supply difficulties and constant casualties. I discussed the Battle of Yichang with the highest commander of artillery in the area and learned that the Japanese artillery positions were very difficult to destroy. These artillery positions were steel and concrete bunkers with heavy iron doors that opened when the artillery was fired, and used wire to pull hand grenades to prevent infantry from climbing the mountains to attack. If there were aircraft, it would be very easy to scout and bomb these artillery positions. It was also very difficult for the Chinese army to transport artillery. The Japanese had traffic artillery, and the Chinese army only had narrow and inclined paths in the mountains for traffic, so the artillery had to be dismantled and carried by soldiers themselves. The range of the artillery was also reduced because it was not possible to observe distant targets in these mountains. However, despite these difficulties, the Chinese army was able to occupy three Japanese fortresses on the south bank of the Yangtze River, but was later forced to withdraw. The artillery division finally said that it would be easy to recapture Yichang if there were aircraft, but it would be very difficult to wage modern warfare without aircraft.

Editorial

### Human Cooperation and Productive Construction - The Doctrines of Marx, George, and Wells -

Those sages and philosophers in the world who take social welfare as the premise and painstakingly seek far-reaching plans to save the times and rescue the people include Plato and Aristotle's ideal democratic politics and More's Utopia, which are almost all masterpieces of Western masters. There are many Chinese people who study the ways of cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the country, and pacifying the world. The section in the Book of Rites that says, "When the Grand Course was pursued, a public and common spirit ruled all under the sky… so that the old found occupation to their last days, the strong had employment, the young were properly trained, and all widows and orphans, the disabled and the sick, were well cared for… They disliked that goods should be thrown away upon the ground, but did not necessarily keep them for their own use. They hated that their strength should not be exerted, but did not necessarily apply it to their own benefit. Thus (selfish) schemings were repressed and found no development, and robbers, filchers, and rebellious traitors did not show themselves, and hence the outer doors remained unclosed, and this was (the period of) what we call the Grand Union," is a model of philosophical thought from the ancient sages.

However, the aforementioned guidelines only provide abstract descriptions from a political point of view and in an empty environment. As for the reality of society and the ability to effectively implement such policies, they often lack meticulous planning. It is true that we Chinese people like to aim high and pursue distant goals, and often enter a state of metaphysics. Therefore, the result is like trying to grab water, which is not too little at first, but gradually disappears as it is grabbed, until there is nothing left. Those who can thoroughly understand the crux of the problem, present it clearly, and prescribe the right medicine should be Marx of Germany, George of the United States, and Wells of England. Marx's "Das Kapital" was first published in 1867. George's "Progress and Poverty" was published in 1880. In the past five years, Wells has completed two volumes, "The Fate of Man" and "The New World Order." These three sages and their works may not be fully known to the ears and eyes of our country, but in European and American countries, they are not only the masters and precious guides for economists, but all scholars cannot fail to mention a thing or two.

Now, the reason for mentioning these three sages together is that there is a need for the evolution of the times. We seize this opportunity for a summary review, taking it as a contribution, and hoping for the joint promotion of wise men from friendly countries. Then it is not only that the three sages will have their wishes fulfilled, but it is also for the happiness of all mankind.

Speaking of the motives and experiences of the three sages in writing books and establishing theories, they all have factors that coincide. Marx and George were both deeply influenced by the surging industrial revolution in the late 19th century, and discovered the terrible contradiction in people's livelihood, and thought about ways to save the situation. Wells, on the other hand, was inspired by the symbolism of the collapse of modern civilization in the mid-20th century, and made a call to the world for remedies. The writings of the three sages were all based on the social foundation of the time, and they presented their arguments based on science, but when they were first published, they were never welcomed. This was within their expectations, but they firmly believed that they would be translated into various languages and passed down to future generations, which should also be verified later.

Speaking of the main points of the three men's arguments, Marx believed that the German mode of production at that time was to exploit the value of labor. The value produced by workers was very high, but the value of the compensation they received was very low. The huge difference in value was what he referred to as surplus labor value, which was almost entirely seized by the capitalists. Therefore, capital became thicker and thicker, while labor became thinner and thinner, which would inevitably lead to endless disputes and conflicts. This is what Marx was afraid of and called on the world to correct.

George saw that the land speculation frenzy in the New World had created a distorted development situation. Apart from land speculation, which could obtain the original profit, the compensation for labor and interest was declining day by day. If this continued, the proper use of production factors would inevitably stagnate, and thus it would inevitably lead to reaction and collapse. In order to save this crisis, George advocated the implementation of a single tax system, specifically levying land tax to correct the trend of speculation, and not levying the production of labor as a way to support it. These two men observed different environments, but the pessimistic conclusions and corrective methods they reached were the same. However, the reason why the total collapse they cited as pessimism did not immediately erupt was that it relied on the facilities of foreign expansion and the exploitation of colonies to make up for the low compensation of labor and turn the crisis into safety. This was something that the two men did not take into account in advance.

Wells pointed out that the evolution of mankind has exceeded our expectations. Today, the convenience of transportation has made national borders so small that they cannot maintain the national policy of complete sovereignty. Therefore, he insists that all mankind in the world should urgently eliminate the boundaries, unify the protection of human rights and work, so that all people can enjoy the fruits of civilization.

In summary, Wells' argument is actually a supplement to the findings of Marx and George. However, what Wells did not explicitly state is that today's world is not only becoming smaller and smaller, but there is no more room for any one nation to use and exploit it alone. At the same time, although there are many defects in the economic structure, the progress of production is enough to supply the needs of all mankind. Therefore, the current political and economic environment is very different from that of the 19th century. Therefore, Wells' advocacy of human cooperation is the only shortcut to solve the long-standing problem of mankind. The League of Nations also announced similar proposals a few years ago, which shows that the shortcut for countries to reach the same goal by different routes will have a day of realization. What we expect from all mankind is to work together in harmony and treat everyone equally in order to advance civilization.

### European War Casual Talks: The Soul-Stirring Battle of Russia

The assault troops launched a new attack, unexpectedly reaching the fortress directly, surrounding it on all sides. All that could be seen was darkness swirling within, with no sound of gunfire. The German troops gradually advanced, reaching the rear gate of the fortress. Suddenly, from where the gate opened, machine gun fire and grenades rained down like a storm. In an instant, the gate slammed shut again, with no white flag raised. Thus, the German troops had to station troops to break through the fortress that would rather die than surrender. They advanced from one steel door to another. The Red Army retreated to the staircases, and when the grenades blew up the stairs, they moved to the lower level. Although the German infantry outside had surged in, "street fighting" was underway within the fortress.

Although the Soviet Russian defenders knew that the overall situation was over and irretrievable, they still had one last move. Suddenly, the earth shook and the sky quaked, and a thunderous sound was heard from far below. A cloud of yellow smoke rushed out from the destroyed doorway. Instantly, the entire fortress was silent as death, as the Red Army had destroyed their powder magazine.

What the German army is encountering now is such fighting spirit and courage.

German soldiers are not foolish, nor are they dull and insensitive, like machines. Because he is a young man, because he is accustomed to the precise movements of blitzkrieg, such a battle situation cannot but leave a deep impression on him. This battle situation does not weaken the soldier's courage, but in hundreds of different battle zones, he invariably encounters new enemies and new tactics, which temper him into an even more terrifying new type of soldier. German soldiers have intelligence, courage, and are well-trained, and therefore have great initiative. But the key to their character lies in their attitude towards war—he is a soldier, not a mobilized civilian. Hitler's troops mostly only know various forms of combat. Their life is a long-term struggle, starting from childhood, through the street fighting of the political struggle era, to today's large-scale battles.

Among them, many simply consider returning to normal life as unimaginable. Reporters have met many young German soldiers of different statuses and backgrounds, all of whom are immersed in the wartime military life, and will simply not know what to do once peace is restored. But before the war against Russia, they had not experienced arduous battles, lying in trenches for weeks or months, and suffering for it. They only had long drives, unstoppable, reaching the farthest corners of the European continent. They are mobile soldiers, soldiers of lightning-fast attacks, who can exert all their mental and physical strength in short-term wars. In short, they are soldiers who are good at blitzkrieg.

But the war in Soviet Russia is not a blitzkrieg. The change in German soldiers is one reason for this! Their essence and endurance were tested for the first time. Their courage was also the first time to be tested. They saw the vastness of Russia on the map and felt for the first time that their goal was thousands of miles away.

They fought in pathless swamps and forests, and also fought on plains where all that could be seen was scorched earth.

A German soldier would tell me about a situation when their troops had the opportunity to bathe. They were ordered to defend an airfield, along which was a wide and deep river. When they were naked, calling to each other, and jumping into the clean and cool river, they had long forgotten about the clothes, guns, and physical fatigue in their camp. Unexpectedly, Red Army tanks suddenly appeared from the woods and sprayed them with gunfire. Bombers were also roaring in the air, and machine gun bullets fell like rain. They were not only empty-handed, but also naked, and had to huddle on the riverbank, waiting to die. Many were hit by bullets and fell into the water, and some ran back to the barracks, hurriedly putting on clothes and grabbing guns to fight.

Just as the fierce battle was underway, the German artillery and tanks had rushed to meet them. German fighter planes also flew to attack the Soviet bombers, and reinforcements arrived from the air. Junkers transport planes loaded with guns and soldiers landed on the field, finally holding the airfield. This group of suddenly appearing Red Army troops had been surrounded by the German army and hidden in the deep forest, and were finally repelled. But the coolness of the river and the joy of bathing, this dream, had also disappeared with it.

Such things are countless, and there are reports every day on the vast Eastern battlefield. Just the march on the Finnish side is enough to be a book. There, tanks, cars, and transport vehicles have become waste. The soldiers can only cut through thorns and brambles to advance. The swamps they pass through are bottomless. The military is almost constantly in fear and trepidation. At night, the howling of wolves and tigers is even more thrilling, making people uneasy in their dreams.

The problem of water can also be written into a long article. Soviet Russia lacks drinking water. Under the scorching sun, marching long distances, the soldiers are dying of thirst, so there is no singing in the army. Wherever the army goes, there are no women. In fact, it is not that there are no women, but that Russian women mostly carry guns, like men, and are difficult to approach.

A keen-eyed Swiss observer has carefully observed the growth and combat of the German army and has made the following judgment on German soldiers:

"This group of young people, like Prometheus in Greek mythology, will attack the castles inhabited by the gods. But wasn't Prometheus's final fate very tragic? Did he overthrow the masters of the world? Wasn't he chained to the rock above the abyss, eternally repenting of his bold behavior?"

Only time can answer this question. However, the war in Russia is changing German soldiers, which is undeniable. Today, facing an enemy who is also a product of revolution, they are only beginning to understand the full meaning of being a soldier. (End)

### Shanghai’s Foreign Exchange Needed for Proper Uses, the Government Still Supplies as Usual; British and American Financial and Economic Delegations, Their Opinions Are Consistent with Financial Authorities; Deputy Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun Makes a Statement to the Press

Chongqing – Yu Hongjun, Deputy Minister of Finance, made a statement at a reception for journalists on the 20th, stating that after the arrival in Chongqing of the British Financial and Economic Delegation, Sir Niemeyer, Director of the Bank of England, Mr. Paxsted, Economic Advisor to the Government of Burma, and Mr. Cochran, expert from the U.S. Treasury Department, they have held multiple discussions with the Chinese financial authorities. On relevant issues, their opinions have been consistent with each other. Matters discussed by the members of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee in Hong Kong with the delegation's representatives have been approved by the Chinese government. The Chinese authorities firmly believe that the results of this meeting will lead to closer cooperation between the countries concerned in the economic warfare against Japan. The Chinese government's policy of supplying Shanghai with foreign exchange needed for proper uses has not changed. However, more effective measures will be implemented to prevent Japanese spies and speculators from profiting from it. Sir Niemeyer and Mr. Paxsted will stay in Chongqing for the time being, while Mr. Cochran will soon travel abroad for inspection. U.S. and British members of the Equalization Fund Committee, Messrs. Troxel and Hopper, will also participate in the talks and will return to their posts within this week. Gu Yiqun, Director of the Financial Department, will also travel to Hong Kong to discuss progress with the various committees of the Equalization Fund. (20th dispatch)

After the Establishment of the Foreign Exchange Control Committee, Changes in Foreign Exchange Procedures in Hong Kong; Abolition of Application Procedures for Changes in Commercial Exchange Rates; The Bank of China Will Become the Purchasing Agent for Various Organizations

Hong Kong - After the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Control Committee chaired by Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, many changes in the foreign exchange situation here have been announced. The first is the cancellation of the commercial "black market" exchange rate. Previously, the Central Bank set two exchange rates daily, official and commercial. From October 1st, the Ministry of Finance ordered the cancellation of the bank's commercial exchange rate. After that, the Central Bank will only have one exchange rate for foreign exchange transactions, as determined by the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. Applications from various government agencies, merchants, and individuals, if approved by the government, can only obtain foreign exchange at the official exchange rate. The second change is in procedures. Previously, all applicants for foreign exchange submitted their applications to the Ministry of Finance, which were reviewed by a special committee established by the ministry. Since the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Control Committee, all applications must be submitted to the first section of the committee responsible for this matter. However, it is heard that the Foreign Exchange Control Committee is focusing on reviewing applications from government agencies and the development of various enterprises, and has authorized the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee to review applications for foreign exchange from private individuals and businesses. The third change is related to purchasing goods from abroad. Previously, after applicants obtained foreign exchange from the Central Bank, they could purchase goods abroad themselves. This will no longer be the case in the future. After government agencies obtain foreign exchange from the Central Bank, they must submit their purchase orders to the Central Bank. Therefore, the Central Bank will become the sole purchasing agent for various government agencies. It is heard that this method can eliminate competitive purchasing, and by combining purchases through the Central Bank, lower prices can be obtained. In addition, the possibility of some agencies using foreign exchange to purchase items not approved by the government can also be eliminated. To handle this matter, a special purchasing division has been established in the Central Trust Bureau. It is heard that a commission of 10% will be charged, with the Central Trust Bureau retaining 1% and the remaining 9% being transferred to the relevant agencies. (Reuters, 20th)

### Causing Panic and Unrest: Yellow Tiger and White Tiger

The resurgence of the black market "Yellow Tiger" has created an astonishing new wave, with rapid and unpredictable price fluctuations. After an unprecedented surge, it suddenly eased slightly, leaving people in a state of extreme confusion. Rumors regarding the foreign exchange situation in this city have been circulating. The black market exchange rate tightened sharply, and a certain cash firm spared no expense to raise prices, resulting in an unprecedented high price of 13,000 yuan, breaking the previous record high of 11,400 yuan on the 14th of this month. The increase of 1,730 yuan compared to the afternoon closing price of last Saturday also broke the record of the largest increase of 1,140 yuan on that day. The rise was inevitably excessive, and when the foreign exchange market stabilized slightly, a selling wave was triggered. Large amounts were dumped by the Hong Kong and Chaozhou gangs. Xiangxing, Yong, Dafeng, Mingfeng, Shihe, and Xianghe actively sold, retreating 780 yuan, and the price dropped to 12,220-30 yuan. Ultimately, the price rose by 1,030 yuan. Trading was very active throughout the day, with a total of 3,500-3,600 taels traded on one side. As a result, the October gold futures, which had already disappeared, were no longer inquired about. Only 80 taels were traded at the opening and afternoon prices that day. The price of jewelry also reached a new high of 1,330 yuan, before falling back to 1,260 yuan, a rise of 110 yuan. The one-week cash delivery, which was originally scheduled to start today, may be delayed until Thursday due to the need for improvements to the regulations.

Cash Rises Sharply by More Than a Thousand

Cash prices rose sharply again, rising sharply in the morning due to rumors about foreign exchange. Shihe first entered Yongcheng with 10 taels, and the opening price was surprisingly 12,400 yuan, 1,130 yuan higher than last Saturday. Later, with few sellers, Shihe again aggressively raised the price by 600 yuan before entering Fukangyong and Yongcheng with 10 taels each, and Decheng with 30 taels, reaching an unprecedented high price of 13,000 yuan. Xinfengyong, Shunyuan, Xiangxingyong, Dafeng, Yongcheng, Yifeng, and Mingfeng competed to sell, and the price gradually fell. Seeing Shihe reappear, the decline was even faster, falling by 700 yuan to 12,300 yuan. Chengji, Tianyuan, Xianghe, and Decheng absorbed, raising the price again to 12,400 yuan. Defu, Mingfeng, Xiangxingyong, Tianyuan, and Shihe actively sold, pressing the price down to 12,240 yuan. Shunyuan, Decheng, Hesheng, and a certain bank absorbed, aggressively raising the price to 12,550 yuan. Chida, Chengji, and Dafeng dumped, gradually decreasing by 320 yuan. Tianyuan exited Chengji with 10 taels, retreating to 12,230 yuan. Defu re-entered, and the afternoon closed at 12,250 yuan. In the afternoon, Xiangxingyong exited Decheng with 20 taels, at 12,220 yuan. Mingfeng, Decheng, and Hesheng actively entered, rising by 230 yuan. Defu entered Xiangxingyong with 10 taels, rising to 12,450 yuan. Shihe, Xianghe, and Xiangxingyong dumped huge amounts, gradually retreating to 12,250 yuan, before Decheng aggressively retreated, slightly raising the price to 12,330 yuan. The evening closed at 12,300 yuan, a sharp increase of 1,030 yuan compared to last Saturday afternoon. A total of 3,500 taels were traded that day, with a difference of 780 yuan. The listed price of gold at gold shops was 12,500 yuan, with the purchase price being about 300-400 yuan lower than the selling price.

Futures Only 90 Yuan Higher

The October futures opened sharply at 9:30 AM, also amidst the chaos, opening 220 yuan higher at 8,500 yuan. Later, as cash prices rose and then slightly eased, Tianyuan and Qingtaiyong sold off, and the price also fell back down. The afternoon closed at 8,350 yuan. There were no trades after opening at the same price in the afternoon, and the closing price at 4:00 PM was 8,370 yuan. Trading was sparse, and the price was 90 yuan higher than last Saturday afternoon, with an upward fluctuation of 150 yuan.

Jewelry Rises by 110 Yuan

The selling price of jewelry per tael at Dahangtong and Xinhangtong was surprisingly set at an unprecedented high of 1,330 yuan at 9:30 AM in the morning, before gradually decreasing, and was listed at 1,260 yuan. At noon, it was 1,280 yuan. At 2:45 PM in the afternoon, it dropped again by 20 yuan to 1,260 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by 50-60 yuan, a huge increase of 110 yuan.

Double Horse Opens at Limit Up

The White Tiger's yarn market is firm and the price surge came suddenly. This is because the gold market is jumping and there are many rumors about positive news, saying that the situation between Japan and the United States is easing and that the black market foreign exchange will not be supplied. The market unanimously bought in. The sellers were hesitant to move due to the turbulent situation. So they called out to each other. The first board of 20s Double Horse factory singles has risen above the limit-up level to 2,170 yuan and should be announced as limit-up. Outside the market, trades were made at 2,220 yuan. Then, as those who made a profit came out, the momentum slightly eased to 2,185 yuan. However, the exchange's first board rose sharply by 80-90 yuan. The second board also hit limit-up. So morale was revived and rose again to 2,215 yuan. In the afternoon, since the board had exceeded the limit-up, the market was closed as usual. As for the spot yarn Hakka Gang transactions, they were completely stagnant. Only the "pigskin" transactions among peers had a turnover of 8,000 bales. On the export side, it was heard today that 20 pieces of Japanese yarn were shipped to Xiamen.

Gold Double Horse Also Keeps Pace

Gold Double Horse futures rose sharply. The factory order opened and immediately announced limit-up. The October futures closed the last day at 1,890 yuan. November opened at 1,997 yuan, up 100 yuan, immediately hitting limit-up. December opened at 2,045 yuan, also limit-up. After entering October, it rose to a high of 1,918 yuan as the afternoon closing price. After tracing in the afternoon, trading continued. The October futures closed short, rising more than 20 yuan again, closing at 1,945 yuan, closing up 89 yuan. The November and December futures saw profit-taking and slightly eased, each rising by about 90 yuan. The intensity of the rise was expected by this newspaper long ago. The softness of the market price a few days ago was actually due to the panic caused by the international situation. So as soon as there was easing, there was a sudden surge. However, although the current trend is still subject to other unpredictable rumors, from a general observation, regardless of the situation, the lack of local cotton and the arrival of foreign cotton should be noted in terms of cost. A list is provided below.

### The Cessation of Black Market Foreign Exchange Supply is Rampant

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday saw no change in the listed prices of the Central Bank and HSBC. HSBC's small counter price remained stable. Black market speculators of British and American foreign exchange once again released various rumors about the Equalization Fund abandoning the maintenance of the local black market exchange rate, causing a general sense of terror among those who were unaware of the underlying circumstances. Suppliers suddenly disappeared again. After opening in the morning, it was heard that an importer who was not allowed to apply was willing to pay 3.75 yuan for US dollars. The seller never offered a price. A hidden chaotic situation prevailed. US dollar bills soared to 33 yuan, making US dollars even tighter at only 3.125 yuan. At noon, those who were willing to pay slackened their intentions as the price was too expensive, and the situation slightly eased. There was little change in the afternoon, and no transactions were heard all day. According to the evening closing price, the British exchange rate was approximately 2 shillings and 1.25 pence, and the US exchange rate was 3.25 yuan. Compared to last Saturday afternoon, the British exchange rate tightened by 1.25 pence, and the US exchange rate tightened by 6.25 pence.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds rise sharply by 15 yuan along with the cash price. British gold bills also rose sharply by 6 yuan. US dollar bills rose as high as 33 yuan before suddenly retreating to 30 yuan in the afternoon, eventually settling at 30.05 yuan, up 2.25 yuan. There was also strong demand for Hong Kong bills, and the market price rose by 0.3 yuan. The rise in Japanese gold bills was rampant, with the evening market rising to 2.81 yuan. Korean bills also followed, rising to 2.13 yuan.

### High Cotton Prices Lead to Fewer Transactions

The spot cotton situation continued to rise due to rumors, but transactions were quite few and have entered a stagnant state. Yesterday, there were still Lan Gong Indian cotton transactions, and the price was more than ten yuan higher than last week. Most of the holders have unlimited confidence, resulting in higher prices but lower volume.

Lan Gong 100 bales 530.0 Haojia Jin
Again 200 bales 535.0 Again
Again 100 bales 540.0 Again
Again 200 bales 543.0 Again
Again 200 bales 555.0 Again
Again 100 bales 55.5 Again

### Rice Market Full of Buying Voices, Fortunately Public Bond Rice Is Released, Slightly Curbing the Tax Atmosphere

Yesterday, the rise in foreign rice became more intense. Since being raised by the influence of the international situation, people are mostly bullish. Yesterday, there was also talk of stopping the supply of foreign exchange, and people were even more excited. Inside and outside the industry, all hoarders rushed to absorb, and the market was full of buying voices. Floating multi-scattered households took the opportunity to be active, and the "pigskin" rush was exciting. The market price rose step by step. Small-grained current rice opened at 140 yuan and rose all the way to 145 yuan. No. 1 Saigon reached 156-7 yuan, which was 5-6-7 yuan higher than the previous market. Yinghua Si's small-grained rice also rose from 167 yuan to 169 yuan. The rapid rise could not be stopped. It was later heard that the Municipal Council had released a batch of small-grained rice, and the market immediately fell by 4-5 yuan. The small-grained rice returned to 140 yuan, but in the afternoon it returned to 144-5 yuan. Before the market closed, it was confirmed that 1,500 tons of publicly sold small-grained rice had been released, and the price began to stabilize slightly, closing at 143 yuan, which was still 4-5 yuan higher than last Saturday. No less than 3-40,000 bags were traded. Another 1,000 tons were traded.

The domestic rice market for thick and thin, newly broken, and two japonica rice types, although the arrival of goods was not weak, with a total of 400+ stone of newly broken and two japonica rice types arriving, the people's hearts were on edge, resulting in owners holding out for higher prices. However, the local shops did not dare to buy too much. The two japonica rice varieties increased by only 2-3 yuan each. Kai Nanport Early Broken Rice opened at 158-9 yuan. Kunshan New Japonica rice opened at 157-8 yuan, Qingjiao kiln species and Fengjing Bai Ge opened at 159 yuan, settling on 157.5 yuan. Dujian still lacked goods and was not marketed.

The market for glutinous rice was most popular due to the prolonged interruption of supply and near-exhaustion of goods. Customers were apprehensive of running out of goods, causing the market to be most popular. Under the hoarding of goods by the owners, the price continued to rise sharply. Hong Kong Gaobai Yuan opened at 172 yuan, and the inferior goods also required 168-9 yuan. Glutinous Lv opened at 161 yuan, settling on 159 yuan, an increase of 8-9 yuan compared to the week before.

### Domestic Debt Still Lacking Revitalization

The gray market for public bonds was still weak yesterday. Although the Sichuan gang did not release spot goods, there was a large amount of spot goods congestion. In addition, credit was tight. The general mentality of the market was that buying public bonds was equivalent to depositing legal tender in a bank, with the idea that profits are small but stable, which cannot be compared with other types of speculation that rise and fall sharply. At present, due to unfavorable circumstances, it is impossible to raise the price. In the morning, Xinhua, Yitai, Jiufeng, and Tongkang bought in, and the market price briefly saw a high side. However, later Zhongfu, Changji, Xinfeng, Xinfu, and Zhenkang sold off, either with many long positions coming out, or spot goods being released, and the buyers were completely for short covering. The noon closing price was still below last Saturday's closing price. In the afternoon, Xinhua, Yitai, Jiucheng, and Lianhe covered their positions, but Zhenkang still sold off. Hongda, Runxun, and Shunqin all sold off, and the market gradually weakened. Type C was traded at a small price of 8.4 yuan, and the future is still less optimistic. As a result, the market prices were slightly lower by 1.5 to 3 corners than on all except for Type B. The total turnover was 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan. A brief and clear table is listed below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Sanyou Industrial Society were traded at a price of 29 yuan per share.

The stock market in the Public Industry Hall initially rose by many parties, and the opening price was close to the high point of last week. After the opening, due to the excessive rebound, the profit-takers dumped and the short-sellers took the opportunity to push down. The price fell step by step, and the market closed at almost the lowest price of the day.

### Sugar Prices Rise Sharply

The sugar market rose sharply yesterday because of the rampant rumor that foreign exchange supply to Shanghai would be stopped. In the Guild's allocation, the spot price of Grade 24 coarse white sugar in October import rose from 219 yuan to 235 yuan, September from 217 yuan to 234 yuan, August from 216 yuan to 233 yuan, and July from 212 yuan to 232 yuan, all rising by 24-5 yuan. Hong Kong goods also rose directly from 197 yuan to 218 yuan, closing at 216 yuan, up 27 yuan. Dutch red opened at 185 yuan, returning to 81 yuan in the middle, and the morning closing was still 85 yuan. The afternoon tightened again to 188 yuan to 196 yuan, up 19 yuan. Taikoo Grade C White rose from 215 yuan to 230 yuan, up 22 yuan. HX Mark rose from 203 yuan to 5 yuan, and rose from 15 yuan to 18 yuan in the afternoon, up 21 yuan. H Mark was also 180 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Rises Straight Up

Factory Cloth: The market trend was yesterday, and hoarding flourished again due to the rumor that the Equalization Fund would stop the supply of foreign exchange. The selling price rose sharply, with plain white cloth and twill rising by 1 to 2 yuan. The opening prices for bleached and dyed cloth and flannel varied, rising by about 1 yuan. More than 1,000 pieces were traded on this street, with hoarding accounting for the majority of purchases. On the 21st, twelve pieces of cloth were shipped to Xiamen.

### Speculation Permeates the Grain Market

In the grain market yesterday, a speculative atmosphere permeated, and both insiders and outsiders eagerly competed to buy, leading to a uniform rise in prices. Consequently, cooking oil surged by as much as ten yuan, soybeans rose by about two yuan, corn soared by three to five yuan. The total market sales included fifty barrels of Qingdao raw oil, thirty barrels of soybean oil, one hundred and fifty barrels of Dalian soybean oil, fifty barrels of Jiangbei soybean oil, two hundred cans of raw oil, twenty cases of Jiaozhou raw oil, five hundred dan of Dayou Factory refined oil, three thousand dan of various factories' vegetable oil, and over two hundred packages of Tianjin Jinyuan.

According to information released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department, regarding the matter of price control, the Council held two meetings on the 18th and 20th of this month for detailed discussions. As a result, it was resolved to request the Consular Body to approve a "New Appendix" to the Land Regulations, authorizing the Council to formulate regulations regarding the management of retail prices of essential goods. Recently, the public has been paying close attention to this issue. The Council believes it should clearly announce its established policy. The Council believes that the urgent task in the current situation is to find ways to control speculation and profiteering in essential goods. On the other hand, the Council is well aware that it should not interfere with normal business operations in any way, so as not to affect the import of essential goods into Shanghai. Without the cooperation of merchants, price management cannot be fully effective, except if the management agency can control the source of goods and prohibit the re-export of goods. However, since neither of these two methods is applicable to the Council, the Council's initial efforts should focus on managing the retail prices of certain essential goods, while relying on the cooperation of importers and firms.

The Entire City's Merchants and Residents Should Exercise Self-Restraint

Furthermore, it was decided that the public should not expect that many goods will soon be placed under control, as the Council's decisions are based on management methods that can be implemented and are deemed by the Council to be effective for the benefit of the public. The management of the prices of major goods will be implemented gradually, while full consultations will be held with relevant parties. The Council has no intention of interfering with the legitimate profits of importers, wholesalers, and retailers. However, one point needs to be solemnly declared: if the authority that the Council intends to request can be obtained, then price management can be implemented, and there is no need to worry about bias in the handling of certain cases. Finally, the public is advised that the way to protect themselves is not to hoard goods for private use, so as not to fuel speculation and profiteering.

The Council's Proposed Measures Can Be Approved Immediately

According to the English-language "China Press", the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement held a Council meeting at 9:30 this morning (the 20th) in the Council building, lasting 35 minutes, and resolved to draft an appendix to be submitted to the Shanghai Consular Body for approval, in order to control retail prices and illegal profiteering within the Settlement. It is reported that the Council already held a meeting last Saturday noon and the new appendix drafted is expected to be submitted to the Consular Body this afternoon and approved within a few days. This morning, an official of the Municipal Council explained that the new appendix does not require the approval of the taxpayers, as the taxpayers had already passed a resolution at the annual meeting, granting the Municipal Council full authority to take this step. As far as can be known this morning, the methods that the Municipal Council will adopt to control retail prices and illegal profiteering are similar to those taken by the French Concession, and will be carried out in full cooperation with the French Municipal Council, as any measures would be difficult to be fully effective without cooperation between the two concessions.

Coal Briquette Prices Are Already Under Discussion

Regarding the control measures taken by the French Municipal Council last week, the Director-General of the Council, Tan Gutie, was unable to issue any comments, but stated that he was waiting for the authorities of the International Settlement to take steps, and then both sides could be expected to cooperate more closely to deal with the current situation. It is reported that the authorities of the two concessions have already begun discussions on controlling the price of coal briquettes, and a decision can be expected within a few days. At the same time, the price of ordinary bread in Shanghai rose by another four jiao today. Cognac Hennessy V.S.O.P. increased to one hundred and twenty-five yuan per bottle, and Hennessy X.O. increased to one hundred and seventy-five yuan per bottle, and only one bottle can be purchased per customer. The French Municipal Council's Price Evaluation Committee also held an important meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Vina, with representatives from the rice industry, firewood and coal industry, Chinese and foreign grocery industry, soy sauce industry, and fresh meat industry participating. Officials from the Municipal Council and the police force attended the meeting. In addition to each industry reporting on market conditions, the issue of prices was also discussed.

Flour Prices Rise Again

The Flour Noodle Manufacturers Association sent representatives on the 13th of this month to petition the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, requesting that it directly purchase flour, transport it to Shanghai for sale at fair prices, and actively find ways to suppress the price of flour and crack down on illegal hoarding. At yesterday's meeting, the Council specifically discussed the stabilization of the flour market and resolved to directly purchase flour and transport it to Shanghai for sale at fair prices. However, according to a reporter from the "New Voice News Agency", some flour merchants, blinded by profit, are single-mindedly aiming to obtain illegal profits and deliberately raising prices for profiteering, resulting in continuous sharp increases in flour prices in recent days. All mechanized noodle shops in Shanghai have been affected by the sharp increase in flour prices and have requested the association to allow them to appropriately increase the price of noodles in order to maintain their capital. The association, in order to take care of the business of its members, has approved the request of the members to increase the price of noodles from today, with a uniform price of 8.5 jiao per market jin, not to exceed the limit. The price of cut noodles is 8.7 jiao, the price of machine-made noodles is 8.5 jiao, and the price of flour is 1 yuan, all calculated per market jin.

The Rice Bureau Orders Rice

The price of rice rises daily, and the people's food is difficult to obtain. Yesterday, the number of bags of Municipal Council rice that rice shops applied to the Jardine Matheson & Co. to purchase increased to more than 10,000 bags. The responsible person of Jardine Matheson & Co. approved all the requests. However, in order to prevent hoarding, Jardine Matheson & Co. stipulated that rice shops that have purchased Municipal Council rice from rice retailers in the past will not be allowed to continue to purchase Municipal Council rice from Jardine Matheson & Co. until the Municipal Council rice of that rice shop has been sold out. Only after the Municipal Council rice stored in the rice shop has been sold out will the shop be allowed to purchase more.

### Belgian Ambassador Travels from Hong Kong to Chongqing

The Belgian Ambassador to China, Baron Guillaume, and his wife, after returning to Shanghai, have been engaged in numerous social engagements. In order to maintain close contact with the Chinese government, they left Shanghai last week on a transport to Hong Kong and then flew to Chongqing on a flight to pay respects to the central authorities in the capital.

### Rumors of Foreign Exchange Not Being Maintained Are Firmly Denied; Market Fluctuations Are Entirely Due to a Lack of Common Sense; Foreign Exchange Allocation Methods Are Generally Lenient

After an irresponsible report was published by the Associated Press, stating that sources in Washington, D.C., and London anticipated that, as a result of meetings currently being held in Chongqing and Hong Kong, the United States and the United Kingdom may no longer assist the Chinese government in continuing to stabilize the exchange rate of the legal tender in Shanghai, the Shanghai black market experienced extreme volatility yesterday. Foreign exchange shrank dramatically, and cotton yarn rose by seventy-nine yuan at the opening, immediately halting trading. Cash reached a new high of 13,000 yuan, causing widespread panic and extreme chaos. In fact, the above report is completely inaccurate. Responsible parties firmly denied it to a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday. According to an official of the Exchange Stabilization Fund in Shanghai, this rumor completely lacks common sense. The Exchange Stabilization Fund has been working to stabilize the legal tender for four years, why would it destroy its efforts in one day? There is no reason to stop maintaining the legal tender at this time, and the Exchange Stabilization Fund will never do so. In order to avoid wasting funds and cracking down on speculative activities, the Exchange Stabilization Fund has strictly defined methods for managing the Shanghai foreign exchange market, but it has never hindered the development of legitimate trade. This is a commonly seen and heard fact. Now, in order to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants, the Exchange Stabilization Fund will allow importers who had foreign orders before the management of the Shanghai foreign exchange market began on August 18, and who have not yet been supplied with foreign exchange, to apply to the Exchange Stabilization Fund for the supply of foreign exchange in writing through the handling bank. This is sufficient proof of the leniency of the Exchange Stabilization Fund's measures.

### American Troops Ordered to Cooperate in Preventing Atrocities Within Their Defense Zone; Colonel Howard Orders All Officers and Soldiers to Act at Any Time, Whether on Duty or Not

According to the English-language "China Press", the headquarters of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai announced today (the 20th) that the commander of the regiment, Colonel Howard, has ordered all American officers and soldiers in the regiment, whether on duty or not, to take all actions within their authority to prevent acts of terrorism in the American defense zone. This order was issued last Saturday and stated that terrorist acts have recently occurred several times in the American defense zone.

Therefore, all officers and soldiers in the regiment are warned to be especially careful, whether on duty or not, to prevent terrorist acts. It can be seen from this that American soldiers who are not armed and are not on duty will also take all possible actions to prevent terrorist acts against any person or property and to arrest those who attempt to commit such acts. The American defense zone is Zone "C" of the International Settlement, bounded by the Suzhou Creek to the north, Avenue Foch to the south, and Yu Yaqing Road to the east. Although there have been frequent reports of American soldiers who were not on duty interfering in cases of robbery and catching criminals, it is believed to be the first time in history that they have been ordered to maintain order within their defense zone even when not on duty.

Previous orders issued by American commanders had stipulated plans for American soldiers to assist the police during public emergencies and political anniversaries. However, the new order issued today allows American soldiers to take the initiative in preventing terrorist acts, and they can decide how to enforce the law themselves without waiting for the police to arrive. When reporters asked Shi Maoru, the acting director of the Shanghai Municipal Police, about this order, Shi declined to comment, saying that he had not received a copy of the order. The reporter then read the order aloud, but Shi still did not explicitly state whether the order would help the police in suppressing terrorist acts. He said, "I have not seen this order, and I am extremely busy with official duties. Please excuse me for not saying more," and then hung up the phone. The order issued by Colonel Howard and signed by Executive Officer Lieutenant Colonel Curtis is as follows: "The Operations and Training Order of this Regiment has previously clearly stipulated that in certain situations, the officers and soldiers of this Regiment will assist the Shanghai Municipal Police

and, in emergencies, replace the work normally performed by the police. Due to the recent recurrence of several terrorist acts in the American defense zone, all officers and soldiers of this Regiment, whether on duty or not, must be especially careful to prevent the continuation of terrorist acts in this zone and take all actions within their authority in accordance with existing orders to prevent terrorist acts against any person or property and to arrest those who attempt to commit such acts."

### The "Dartagnan" Ship Had an Accident Yesterday

The French Postal Shipping Company's postal ship, "Dartagnan," which loaded over 8,500 bags of corn and over 3,500 items of cotton from Saigon, and 1.18 million feet of lumber from Little Luzon, arrived in Shanghai last Friday (the 17th), berthed at buoys 11 and 12. It unloaded the lumber first, and then moved to the Shunqin Wharf to unload corn, cotton, and other goods. At around 3:00 PM yesterday, while unloading lumber, the cotton inside the ship suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. Thick smoke billowed straight up, and the fire blazed fiercely. The shipowner learned of this and immediately ordered the raising of the distress flag. The Pudong Lujiazui Customs Fireboat saw this and rushed to the postal ship to pour water to extinguish the fire. It was not until around 5:00 PM that the fire was extinguished. The loss is reported to be very large, but the exact amount is unknown.

### Storing Too Much Kerosene and Gasoline Poses a Fire Hazard; The Fire Department Begins Investigation and Issues Warnings

According to a public notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department, many residents, in addition to illegal hoarders, are purchasing and storing excessive amounts of dangerous liquids such as kerosene and gasoline, creating a serious fire hazard. In view of this, the Council's Fire Department, in order to protect the lives and property of citizens, has dispatched personnel to investigate many houses. Once discovered, warnings will be issued, and if necessary, public prosecutions will be filed with the court for punishment. The Fire Department filed multiple public prosecution cases in July, August, and September regarding the storage of excessive amounts of dangerous goods such as kerosene, gasoline, alcohol, and celluloid. The courts have imposed separate penalties as a warning. The Department welcomes reports of the storage of excessive amounts of these dangerous goods and hopes that citizens will cooperate to remove the danger of fire.

### Curfew Hours Will Revert to the Old Clock Time Next Month

Daylight saving time in the two concessions has been set to be abolished starting at 0:00 on the 2nd of next month. The clock will be turned back one hour to restore the old clock time. The curfew time will also change at the same time and will be enforced according to the old clock time.

### Sales of Commemorative Stamps Also Have a Black Market

The commemorative stamps for the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China were completely sold out after only two days of sales, and many people were unable to purchase them. It is now known that merchants specializing in the sale of commemorative stamps are taking advantage of the public's need to raise the price of those they have previously purchased for sale, just like other commodities that have a black market. This is rare in previous sales of commemorative stamps.

### Rotary Club Regular Meeting This Week

The regular meeting of the Shanghai Rotary Club this week is scheduled to be held at the Metropole Hotel at noon on October 23 (Sunday). At that time, Mr. Adamson, Secretary of the Navy YMCA who has come to Shanghai from Hankou and a member of the Club, will give a lecture on the topic of "Shooting Techniques."

### The "General" Series of Three Postal Ships Has Changed Routes; Transferred to the Navy Department, Plans to Temporarily Not Sail to Shanghai; American Cargo Ships Continue to Undertake Shanghai-America Cargo Transportation as Usual

Recently, due to the turbulent conditions of the Pacific Ocean, the voyage of merchant ships has been changed repeatedly. Shanghai is a neutral port, and American ships should continue to maintain shipping between Shanghai and America. However, according to ocean shipping industry, the maintenance of Shanghai-America shipping by American ships is difficult to guarantee if changes occur in the Pacific Ocean.

New Routes for Three Ships

It is also learned that the "President" series of postal ships operated by the American President Lines on the Pacific route—the "President Cleveland," "President Taft," and "President Pierce"—have now been renamed the "General" series and transferred to the U.S. Navy Department. There is a rumor that the routes have changed and they will not come to Shanghai temporarily. It is heard that the new voyage will start from San Francisco, travel directly to Little Luzon via Honolulu, travel from Little Luzon to Hong Kong, and then travel directly from Hong Kong to Honolulu, returning to San Francisco. It is not yet certain whether the postal ship "President Coolidge" will still travel on the original route or change separately. The company's World Line postal ships only go as far as Singapore.

Ships Sailing to Shanghai

Those ships traveling directly from Honolulu to Shanghai, then to Hong Kong, Little Luzon, and various Nanyang ports to Singapore, and then returning to Shanghai and back to America on the original route from Singapore, include two World Line ships this month, passing through Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to Singapore, and one ship coming from Singapore to Shanghai and returning to America. The names and dates of the ships are being kept secret, so they cannot be specified.

Bain's Talk

Bain, an American government consultant, recently arrived in Manila by clipper. According to Bain, American ships can now travel from the east coast of the United States to the Red Sea, unload wartime supplies for England, and then sail to Singapore and Manila in the Far East, and then transport the products of the two places to the United States. After this type of navigation is decided, the difficulty of the shortage of tonnage of ships sailing between the United States and the Philippines can be relieved. If the Pacific deteriorates, the U.S. Wartime Navy Department will make every effort to maintain the issue of American ship passage. We have every reason to believe that as long as ship navigation is maintained and not interrupted, American goods and wartime raw materials will be transported as usual to Singapore, Manila, Hong Kong, and other Far Eastern ports including Shanghai. This is true not only for ships transporting wartime supplies, but also for other ships. It is learned that Dr. Bain went to the United States this summer and is responsible for the role of a "de facto" dictator. Bain will remain in the Philippines until the end of this year and will travel to various distant places in the future. The task he is responsible for is regarding the control of oil-related matters. According to Bain's statement, the United States has decided to maintain shipping to the Pacific and Far Eastern ports. The implication is clear.

### Hong Kong's Entry Restrictions Are Becoming Increasingly Strict; Those Permitted to Enter Hong Kong Are Limited to Leaving Within Six Months

The Hong Kong Immigration Department has issued a new order canceling entry permits issued within six months as invalid, so that those who want to go to Hong Kong without an immigration permit or entry permit outside of Hong Kong must have someone in Hong Kong pay a deposit of HK$100 to the Immigration Department in advance, obtain a formal receipt, and after the entrant arrives in Shanghai to complete the entry permit procedures, they must hold the receipt to the Immigration Department to retrieve the deposit. It is also stipulated that those who pay the deposit must have previously held a six-month or expired entry permit in Hong Kong in order to be effective. Otherwise, there must be a review procedure. If the person is allowed to pay the deposit to enter Hong Kong, they are limited to leaving Hong Kong within six months. Those who overstay will be ordered to leave.

### A Gathering of White Russians Was Prohibited Without Permission

According to the "China Press," representatives of various White Russian groups in Shanghai recently gathered on October 2 to discuss how to promote the collection of income tax from White Russians to cope with the large expenditures of the White Russian Immigration Committee. The representatives originally scheduled to gather yesterday (the 19th) afternoon at the Public Canteen for Aiding White Russians at 764 Rue Bourgeat to continue discussions, but this was prohibited by the French police, resulting in the cancellation of yesterday's meeting. It is planned to find a way to hold another meeting next week. According to reliable sources, the French police did not issue the necessary permit for yesterday's meeting, for unknown reasons. However, it is generally believed that the French police are following the policy of prohibiting all political gatherings within the Concession, hence this action.

### American Consul General Announces Changes to Nationality Law

The American Consul General announced yesterday that, according to the new law passed by the House of Representatives, naturalized American citizens lose their American citizenship only after residing outside of American territory for more than two years. It is said that this provision is different from the Nationality Law stipulated in 1940. The 1940 law stipulated that naturalized American citizens, except in specified special circumstances, would be considered to have lost their citizenship after residing outside of American territory for one year from the date of approval of that law. The new law passed by the House of Representatives this time has extended the period from one year to two years. Therefore, the effective period of citizenship of naturalized Americans is until October 14, 1942.

### Goods for Comforting Soviet Troops Have Been Loaded on a Ship and Shipped to Hong Kong

According to the "Shanghai Times", the first batch of comfort goods collected by the Russian-language newspaper in the city, totaling 31 boxes, about 1,000 packages, were loaded yesterday (the 19th) on a certain ship managed by Jardine Matheson & Co. and shipped to Hong Kong, and then directly transferred to Vladivostok, to be distributed by the Soviet authorities. The comfort goods include winter clothing, candy, tea, coffee, cigarettes, razors, and other items. They were donated by Russian expatriates in Shanghai who enthusiastically responded to the donation campaign launched by the Russian-language newspaper.

### Bank of Communications Establishes a Branch in India; The Rangoon Branch Is Expanded

In order to develop trade between Burma, India, South Africa, and other places and China, the Bank of Communications has decided to establish a branch in Calcutta, India. Preparations have been completed, and it is expected to open for business in early November. Wen Wanqing, the former manager of the Guangzhou branch, has been transferred to serve as the manager of the branch. As for the Rangoon branch, it has recently been expanded, adding one assistant manager and several staff members. Peng Xianzhan, the assistant manager of the Hong Kong branch, has been transferred to serve as the assistant manager.

### After the Collapse of the "Slippery" Qianzhuang, the Assistant Manager Remains at Large; The Trial of Four Arrested Criminals Has Concluded and a Sentence Date Has Been Set

Since the report on the 14th of this month that the Huikang Qianzhuang at No. 10 Jiyi Lane, Tianjin Road, collapsed after only one day of opening, the assistant manager, Huang Kefu, is still at large. Yesterday morning, the General Inspectorate transferred the four shareholders of the Qianzhuang who had been apprehended—Chen Huiwei, Wang Yifan, Gu Yaokui, and Xu Zhandao—to the Fifth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. The Inspectorate's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted them according to the law and stated the facts of the case, saying that the Inspectorate, in a subsequent search, found a formal contract on the upper floor of No. 437 Nanjing Road. All five shareholders in the contract had signed it. In addition, Tongchang Car Company on Yunnan Road had deposited a check for 1,000 yuan and a check for 30 yuan into the Qianzhuang, as well as 635 yuan in cash. After reading the news of the Qianzhuang's collapse, they stopped payment on the two checks, so the loss was only 635 yuan in cash. In addition, He Yongji, the owner of Ruitai Clothing Store at No. 189 Fujian Road, deposited 2,500 yuan in banknotes, but withdrew 2,000 yuan the next day after the opening, so the actual loss was 500 yuan. It was found that the Huikang Qianzhuang's premises were rented from the landlord for 400 yuan per month, with three months' rent paid in advance, totaling 1,200 yuan. Since the Qianzhuang only opened for a few days, one month's rent should be deducted, and the remaining two months' rent is 800 yuan, which the Inspectorate is now trying to recover. The items found at the Qianzhuang included four desks, eight chairs, and passbooks and checkbooks, as well as other soft items totaling more than 2,400 yuan. When questioned, the defendants gave conflicting testimonies and hired lawyers such as Fan Gang to defend them in court. Judge Dai reviewed the confessions and ordered the defendants to be held in custody pending sentencing in seven days.

### An Explosion Suddenly Occurred on the Robiquet Road Bridge, Destroying Several Wooden Planks

According to the "Shanghai Times," an explosion suddenly occurred at 11:15 last night (the 19th) on the Robiquet Road Bridge near the entrance to the Hongqiao Recreation Club at the corner of Robiquet Road and Hongqiao Road. With a loud bang, several wooden planks were destroyed, but traffic could still pass. At the time of the explosion, a member of the Hongqiao Club happened to be driving his car there and narrowly escaped being hit. Fortunately, the car stopped, preventing the accident.

### A Shoe-Shining Girl Was Enticed into Prostitution; Zhou Yunxian Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment

Xu Guiying, the sixteen-year-old daughter of Xu Li, a woman from Jiangbei who lived at No. 32 Ping An Lane, Avenue Edward VII, was introduced to work at the "Lovely Women's" shoe-shining company at No. 195 Fuzhou Road at the intersection of Yu Yaqing Road on January 20 of this year. However, Zhou Yunxian, a female colleague at the company, saw that Xu was young and easily deceived, so she used sweet words to entice her, saying that the salary here was quite small, and that it would be much more profitable to go to Beiping together. Xu did not know her plan, so she followed her home. Unexpectedly, Zhou colluded with Xu Chunjiang, Bu Afu, Bu Mama, etc., and took Xu to Beiping, where she was sold to a brothel for 700 yuan and forced into prostitution. Xu refused and took the opportunity to escape, throwing herself under passing cars on the road in an attempt to commit suicide. The police took her to the station, learned the facts, arrested the Bu couple, and notified Xu's mother in Shanghai to send someone to Beiping to take her daughter back. At the same time, they reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched detective Tian Changchun to arrest Zhou Yunxian. Yesterday morning, she was transferred to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. The Inspectorate's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, prosecuted her according to the law. After questioning by Judge Zhong, Zhou was sentenced to two years of imprisonment as a warning.

### "Only Studying Makes One Superior"

— Jiang Ping

Faithfully Recommending "New Books of the World"

Tao Kangde is a cultural toiler who is always buried in piles of books. Writing articles, translating books, and editing magazines are his daily life. In addition to editing *Cosmic Wind Bimonthly* and *Affairs of the World*, he has recently put his plan into practice and successively published several "New Books of the World."

Last winter, when I was chatting with him, he planned to publish a series of books. He said that the books must be substantial, beneficial when opened, and flavorful when closed. Although the world is turbulent and people are uneasy, good books will definitely be read. Precisely because in this great era, books are even more needed by people. In early summer this year, he told me that the *World Series* had been successively put into print, with plans to publish ten volumes by the end of this year. Now, seven or eight kinds have been published. This is a rich harvest for him and his translator friends, and a fine food for readers. I admire his hard-working and persevering spirit.

"The Best of Western Magazine Articles" consists of four volumes, totaling about 600,000 words, and has been fully published. The title "The Best of Western Magazine Articles" truly lives up to its name. Originally, this book is a collection of articles published in the famous American "Reader's Digest" over the past eighteen years. "Reader's Digest" is a magazine loved by everyone, with a circulation of more than four million copies. The reasons why it is loved by everyone are: first, the content involves a wide range of fields, including astronomy, geography, customs, history, science, nature, landscapes, and figures, encompassing everything; second, the selected articles are written in a popular and timeless style, concise and to the point, suitable for both young and old, men and women. The content of one issue of Reader's Digest is already dazzling and beautiful. Now, this collection is selected from two hundred and sixteen issues and five or six thousand excellent works, so its brilliance is beyond words. As for this complete translation, the clarity and conciseness of the translation can be said to be the icing on the cake for this book.

"Behind the German Lines" is a true record of the life of the foreign correspondent of the Chicago Tribune during his work in Germany. He wrote it after he left Germany. Regarding everything in wartime Germany, from military and political plans to civilian life, he speaks freely and without restraint. The whole book is about 200,000 words, and reading it is better than taking a trip behind the German lines.

The author of "On the London Front Line" is a long-time resident of London, so he is more suited to describe the shocking experiences of London. This book describes the wartime life as perceived by ordinary Londoners from various perspectives. He does not make any judgments, nor does he make any final verdicts. His intention is only to give people an impression of the current stage of the war, but to allow people to see what kind of life the people living on this small island have lived in this great war in the past fifteen months. The whole book has thirty chapters and two hundred thousand words. Wartime London leaps off the page.

"World Articles" includes twenty-one exquisite short articles, discussing how to be a person, birth control, family, alimony, women, war, literati, and exposing social evils, etc., full of interest.

"New Books of the World" is the general name of this series of books. Each book is engraved with the seal of the child prodigy poem "Only Studying Makes One Superior", which is elegant and worthy of a good book.

### Qianzhuang Accountant and Others' Private Speculation Failed; Embezzled 280,000 Yuan of Zhuang Funds and Was Detained

Cunyi Qianzhuang at No. 20 Jiangxi Road specializes in selling cotton yarn, scarlet gold, and other businesses for customers. Recently, Chen Guanying from Yong, Luo Yongmao from Shaoxing, and apprentice Chen Zhixin, the accountants of the Qianzhuang, were tempted by the benefits of speculation and privately engaged in cotton yarn and scarlet gold. Unexpectedly, every transaction resulted in losses. The losses had to be paid, but Chen and others were not wealthy. Therefore, they misappropriated the certificates and balances paid by the customers of the Qianzhuang. Until recently, manager Sun Jiasheng discovered that the Qianzhuang funds were short by about 280,000 yuan. He reported it to the Central Police Station. Hua Detective Song Yuanshan and detective Yang Zaishan investigated and found out that the shortage of funds was entirely due to Chen and the other two's private speculation and misappropriation. They were arrested and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Bao briefly stated the case and requested a postponement of the hearing because the accounts had not yet been clarified. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered them to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.

### Announcement of the Fifth Essay Contest; Trying to Steal a Chicken but Losing the Rice—A Lesson I Learned—

— Ding Xian

Prices and salaries are like a race between a rabbit and a turtle. However, it is not the rabbit that can jump and bounce that naps on the way, but unexpectedly, it is the turtle that will never try to win that loses!

My wife's complexion is withering day by day; the children are crying and clamoring for this and that; and the old mother's dried intestines, which often cannot eat oily food, are surprisingly hungry, almost becoming a kind of pathological symptom. No wonder, the nutrition of life is too lacking for us.

Under these circumstances, how could I ignore it any longer? I had to find a way to remedy it. However, retrenchment has long been retrenched to the end of "flow". The only way is to develop new sources of income.

However, what legitimate ways are there for such a small and "legless" person to develop new sources of income? Desperate people will try any remedy. Finally, I blindly chose the path that I had always been unwilling to take but often wanted to take——speculation.

I exchanged my wife's only jewelry for capital and started to be an accomplice to the money-grubbers against my conscience. Surprisingly, the heavens did not disappoint the hardworking people. In the first month, the results were very satisfactory. I began to watch the prices of various goods rise with a calm and even eager mood. Although the profit was not enough, every time I bought and sold, I was eager to sell as soon as the price rose. However, I also made a lot of money. The family had vitality, and the solution to livelihood was unexpectedly so easy!

However, the storm came. The good times did not last long. A violent slump suddenly occurred in the market. The eyes of the people all changed to "looking down." Unfavorable rumors spread from all over, explaining all kinds of reasons for "looking down," as if this slump would never end. My "bullish thinking" was shaken. I hurriedly cut off the meat to "turn short" at a small loss. However, the God of Fortune was playing a joke on me. The market suddenly reversed and rose sharply. I received a so-called "two-sided slap" in the market jargon. A thousand days of collecting firewood are burned in one day, and the hard work of one month is not enough to cover.

Trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice, I could not just give up. I still had to find a way to do it. However, from that time on, I had lost the control of management. Whether I went long or short, the result was always the opposite. My capital became shorter and shorter, my thoughts became colder and colder, and my policy became more and more chaotic.

Fortunately, not long after, the bad times came to an end. From the concern of a friend, I got a secret message. I borrowed money by all means and paid the margin to the yarn store to buy ten packages of futures yarn. The friend's message was not false. A few days after I bought it, the market suddenly jumped. I was so excited that I almost wanted to cry. I doubted that I was dreaming. My heart could not stop jumping with the market. A strong taste of bitterness coming to an end strongly hit me. I thought that this time, I was saved.

However, when I was about to sell and dialed the phone number of the yarn store, the situation was a little different from usual. The bell on the other side rang very loudly, but no one answered. I shook it over and over again, but the result was the same. I couldn't help but panic. I rushed to the door of the yarn store. I saw the door open from a distance. My heart was happy. I calmly stepped into the door and looked at the writing room of the yarn store. It was half cold. I didn't expect that it was really empty. The door was locked. Instead of it was a lawyer's liquidation notice. The notice was written with dense small characters. I wanted to see it clearly, but my eyes were already blurred. I only saw the ink marks blooming and blooming, turning into many man-eating beasts, baring their teeth and claws and pouncing on me... I wanted to be angry, but I lost the courage; I wanted to cry, but I had no tears; After a while, I couldn't stop biting my lip and smiling bitterly at it. I thought: Not only can I not get the surplus, but I have also lost my capital. This is the biggest deception in the world, but who told me to throw myself in? ... I finally learned a lesson!

### The Eagle of Poland

— Lin Tao

For their courageous fighting, the Polish pilots serving in the British Royal Air Force will become legendary heroes of this great war. They are fierce warriors because their lives have been stripped of all emotion by encountering the enemy, leaving only hatred for Hitler's iron fist and a desire for revenge. They have lost their homeland. Death is unimportant to them; only when they die can they strike a blow against the culprit of their tragedy.

The British Air Force Intelligence Department announced that the Polish pilots' battle achievements, their names are always kept strictly secret, because most of them have relatives and friends living in German territory. Since August of last year, the authorities have only broken one exception. That was Sergeant Pilot Josef Franciszek, whose name was announced after his death. His glorious flying medal was awarded for shooting down five German planes in a day and a half of fierce fighting.

Initially, the Poles' enthusiasm gave the British commanders a headache. On the ground, the Poles were obedient. But in the air, as long as there were enemies to attack, they refused to line up. If they were directed by radio, the only answer they would get was, "Don't bother, Englishman."

Most of the Polish airmen are scattered in the Air Force service teams, but there is a fighter squadron and a bomber squadron composed entirely of Poles. The Kosciusko Squadron is an old fighting unit that has been reorganized. Before Hitler's blitzkrieg, Poland had a Kosciusko Squadron. Its old-fashioned planes and inadequate equipment were, of course, no match for Hitler's superior air force. After fighting bravely, the aircrew fled, passing through the Balkans to France. There, they gathered with other Polish pilots, obtained some equipment, and returned to the air as a combat unit. When France surrendered, they fled to England. On August 1, 1940, they were incorporated into the British Air Force. It was stipulated that after a month of training, they should familiarize themselves with the use of machine guns and the maneuvering of aircraft before they could take to the skies to fight. But these young men couldn't wait. On August 30, the day before the team was scheduled to participate in the war, Franciszek shot down five German planes.

The final step in the bomber squadron's training was to have them take off with enough gasoline and bombs, as if they were going on a long-range bombing mission. Many planes rose haphazardly. They were supposed to return within a short time. But hours passed, and there was no response. The commander was anxious. Finally, these bombers circled down.

"Where have you been?" the commander asked sternly.

"Bombing Berlin," the Poles replied simply.

In September 1940, the most intense month of the war, the Kosciusko Squadron alone shot down 118 German planes. The day King George visited the squadron was the day the Poles celebrated shooting down thirteen German planes—one-third of the total number of German planes shot down by the Royal Air Force that day.

The Poles are brave flying generals. But they are also excellent pilots.

### Poison Cabinet

— Ke Zhong

In ordinary families, there is often a medicine cabinet for emergencies. This type of medicine cabinet is most likely to arouse children's curiosity. If ordinary medicines are placed together with poisonous medicines, the danger is very great, and lives are at stake. In view of this, American furniture designers have specially added a small steel box to the medicine cabinet, equipped with a sturdy lock, specifically for storing poisons, to prevent children from accidentally taking them, which is also a new advancement in family equipment. Housewives in the country can also follow their example.

Fourteen: Living the Life of a Hero

When Qiu Haitang clutched the two ten-dollar bills, sneaking out of the Heda pawnshop as embarrassed as if he had committed some crime, at least two strings of hot tears were swallowed into his stomach along with a sour feeling.

On the second day after he arrived in Shanghai, he was given the cold shoulder by President Zou of the National Associated Bank and Master Zhang of Zhang's mansion on Julai Road. The former simply refused to see him, and although the latter reluctantly saw him, the moment he caught sight of Qiu Haitang's disreputable appearance and the tattered clothes he was wearing, his face immediately turned as if he hadn't eaten cooked rice porridge in months. Qiu Haitang was indeed still the Qiu Haitang of the past, but the Master Zhang who had once lauded Qiu Haitang to the thirty-third heaven seemed to have died.

On the third day, he hardly had the courage to look for the remaining few acquaintances, but the father and daughter couldn't just wait to starve to death, so he finally braced himself and found the home of a opera fan surnamed Hou.

This Old Mr. Hou was from Chaozhou, and his family ran several pawnshops. Even if he couldn't be considered a major pawnbroker, he at least had three or four hundred thousand in assets. Because he lived a leisurely life, he had become a large fat man weighing over one hundred ninety pounds under the law of "a broad mind and a fat body." But he liked to listen to opera, especially to the falsetto roles, and later, disregarding the earnest advice of many close friends and relatives, he also began to learn female roles. (241)

### "Transformation" of Doctor Ding

— Zou Xiao

After watching Cao Yu's "Transformation" at the Carlton Theatre, I picked this topic. Because I was moved by this character in the play, deeply moved! Those "eliminated and rotten classes" aroused our disgust; they also set off the greatness of Doctor Ding, Commissioner Liang, and others.

The beginning of the second act, the conversation between Doctor Ding and her only son, Ding Chang, I think is an excellent article that "writes the tender heart of a loving mother," and it is worth selecting into junior high school Chinese textbooks as teaching material. When Doctor Ding heard that her son had lost his money, she gave him more money, personally putting some in both pockets; seeing that he had given his flannel shirt to someone else, she gave her own to her son who was a soldier. Later, when the air raid alarm came, almost everyone in the wounded soldier hospital had fled, but Doctor Ding was still wholeheartedly performing surgery for a wounded soldier who was at the critical moment of life and death. This spirit of sacrificing oneself is really worthy of our admiration and respect. I seemed to see her figure gradually growing bigger.

The third act writes about the conflict between Doctor Ding's reason and emotion, "Knowing that her son should still dedicate himself to the motherland after recovering from his injuries, but selfish maternal love seems to be preventing her from this idea. As a result, reason triumphed over everything, and she still took the initiative to delay her son's departure from the dangerous situation, determined to eliminate selfish maternal love." This also moved me.

Ms. Mu Gui, the author of "Carrying the Cross," didn't arrive to see the play until the beginning of the third act. I wanted to say to her, "You're late! It's a pity you didn't see the interesting situation where the large petals and small petals were connected when peeling oranges." This is what she used in her postscript, comparing it to the love between mother and son.

Ms. Danny's superb performance added to the brilliance of the script. She acted so naturally and skillfully that I forgot that she was acting, and I really thought she was the wounded soldiers, no, it should be said that she was the great mother of China.

### Not a Joke

— Xin Fang

The playwright George Bernard Shaw once danced with a woman at a charity ball, and suddenly heard her say, "Why would someone like you, a globally renowned scholar, dance with a poor woman?" "It's a charity ball today!" Shaw replied without hesitation.

The great musician Paderewski, after finishing his performance in front of Queen Victoria, received a warm welcome from the Emperor, who also called him a talented person. "Now I can indeed say that I am a talented person," Paderewski said with a hesitant attitude. "My Emperor! But before my talent was discovered, I could only be called a laborer!"

### Radio Notes

— Yu

As far as I know, in families equipped with radios, most love to listen to Peking opera record programs, mainly because Peking opera itself is relatively popular in entertainment. Peking opera records are the carefully crafted masterpieces of famous actors, and there are many famous actors, such as Tan Xinpei, Sun Juxian, and Chen Delin, who have already passed away. Although we can no longer see them on the stage, we can still listen to "swan songs" from the records!

Many of the records broadcast on the radio are very valuable, but most of them are fragmented. The complete ones are only a few, such as Mei Lanfang and Yang Xiaolou's "Farewell My Concubine," Ma Lianliang and Wang Yurong's "Wujiapo," and Guan Shaohua and Wang Yurong's "Silang Visits His Mother." Therefore, listening to them is not enjoyable enough, and you may even get tired of listening. In the past, there were several radio stations that collected records of various famous actors and broadcast them sequentially. For example, the play "Hongyang Cave" collected records of Yu Shuyan, Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Wang Shaolou, Jin Shaoshan, etc. Such a "grand gathering of famous actors" that was completed in one go was naturally wonderfully continuous, and the audience also felt that it was interesting and enjoyable.

The Democratic Radio Station has a program of "Complete Peking Opera" records every day from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, and on Sundays from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM. Their records can be said to be very complete. In the past, they have broadcast "Hongyang Cave," "The Case of the Black Pot," "The Universe Front," "Jade Hall Spring," "Catching Cao and Letting Him Go," "Searching for Orphans and Rescuing Orphans," "Scolding Cao," "Selling Horses," "Qionglin Banquet," and so on. It is truly good news for audiences who love to listen to complete Peking opera.

### Notes from the Pear Garden

— Cun Ren

Guan Dayuan is coming to Shanghai again, re-affiliated with Gengxin. Qingyi Huang Guiqiu hangs the head card, and Guan ranks second. The proposal for Fu Ying and Jun Qiu to transfer to the troupe after the Great Stage expires has been cancelled.

The Great Stage will be closed for three days from last night to tomorrow. It is said that this is in response to the request of Tan Xiaopei and Fu Ying's father and son to take a break and recuperate, and they will successively reveal and perform various famous plays. It is said that "The Complete Lianying Village One" is approved to be performed in advance.

The third series of "That's Me" at the Gong Stage has been rehearsed, and it is still based on scientific props and scenery. It is approved to open on the 28th night.

Zhao Manyun's affiliation and performance with Gengxin is very strong, so the troupe has requested to arrange and sing "New Cotton Spinning." Jin Yu sings her tune, and various songs are mixed. According to Manyun, the performance has to wait a little longer, but she is confident that she will definitely not let Wu Suqiu and Liang Xiaoluan monopolize the beauty in front of her.

Chapter 18: Vowing to Sweep Away the Xiongnu Regardless of Personal Safety

Li Di said, "In terms of the number of soldiers, we are outnumbered, so they will retreat to the strategic location of Shanhaiguan, and then they can rely on it for both advance and retreat. Therefore, our troops and Wu Sangui's troops will inevitably come into contact there." Liu Zongmin said, "According to the villagers, the government troops have not retreated far. Why don't we chase after them closely and not let them get their wish?" Li Yan said, "Pursuing them too closely may lead to an ambush." Liu Zongmin laughed and said, "Since leaving Tongguan, we have been victorious in every battle and invincible in every attack, only suffering a slight setback at Ningwu Pass. However, Zhou Yuji eventually died in our hands. Wu Sangui is just a young brat. Why should we worry so much? If you don't chase, my left-wing army will chase alone." Li Yan said, "Then please lead the front team, and I will be the rear team. In case of an ambush, I can respond and prevent us from being completely surrounded." Liu Zongmin said, "We have many soldiers and horses, so why fear being surrounded! Even if there is an ambush, I can defeat it. This method is also good. I am naturally willing to lead the front team, and you will respond later." So Liu Zongmin led his subordinates, the bandits, to immediately cross the Luan River and chase forward. Who knew that when they chased to the vicinity of the pine forest, they suddenly heard a signal cannon sound from the forest in front, and a team of government soldiers rushed out and blocked their way. Liu Zongmin took a look at the front and saw that the number of government troops was not large and not well-organized. He taught his subordinates not to worry and just charge forward, and sure enough, they dispersed with one rush. Liu Zongmin laughed and said, "Is this kind of useless government army considered an ambush? Not enough for me to kill." Advancing further, the front was a mountain pass. Liu Zongmin led the troops through first, and again heard a signal cannon sound in the valley. (197)
