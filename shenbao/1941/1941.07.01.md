### Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi and Food Minister Xu Kan Hold Inauguration Ceremony; Chairman Lin Presents the Seal, Wu Jingheng Supervises and Delivers a Speech; Guo Tells Reporters Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; Peace Terms that Sacrifice Sovereignty Will Never Be Considered

Chongqing - The newly appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, Guo Taiqi, the first Minister of Food, Xu Kan, Permanent Vice Minister, Long Songzhou, Political Vice Minister of Finance, Yu Hongjun, and Acting Permanent Vice Minister, Gu Yiqun, held an inauguration ceremony on the morning of the 30th after the Central Joint Memorial Week. President Chiang, Chairman Lin, and members of the Central Committee all attended. Central Committee member Wu Jingheng supervised the oath-taking. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and after presenting the seals, Committee member Wu gave a speech, stating that in the past, the Founding Father greatly relied on Minister Guo. In recent years, Minister Guo has served abroad, negotiating and working tirelessly. Now that he has been transferred to serve in the central government, his future contributions to diplomacy will be significant. Today, aggressive nations are retreating from the peace-loving and righteous. As Minister Guo said recently, the anti-aggression group will further enhance diplomatic ties, strengthen cooperation, and jointly sanction aggressors. It is believed that warlike aggressors will inevitably collapse. Minister of Food Xu Kan has assisted in managing finances for many years with outstanding achievements. This decision to appoint him as Minister of Food demonstrates the importance the central government places on him. Our country's food supply was originally not a problem, but now there is an abnormal situation of having rice but no food. It is hoped that Minister Xu, after taking office, will continue to address the current food problem with revolutionary spirit. As for the three vice ministers, Pang, Yu, and Gu, whether they have served in the central or local governments, or have specialized in finance and economics, it is believed that they will all use their strengths to serve the party and the country. Chairman Lin then gave a speech, stating that for the past four years, our country's foreign policy has followed President Chiang's instructions, adhering to the principle of responding to changes with constancy. Therefore, no matter how international situations evolve, our country's diplomacy remains independent and autonomous. This is all due to President Chiang's foresight. Today, food must be managed, and the methods must be rigorous, thorough, and appropriate. Military and civilian food supplies must be considered simultaneously, and he hopes that the military and civilians, both in the front and the rear, will celebrate having sufficient clothing and food. Minister Guo then gave a reply, and finally, Minister Xu replied, saying that he would diligently follow the instructions of Committee member Wu and the Chairman, lead his colleagues, be faithful to his duties, and work hard to accomplish his mission. After the speech, the ceremony concluded. (30th dispatch)

Editorial

### On Clean Governance

In previous dynasties, the assessment of officials focused on cleanliness, prudence, and diligence. Cleanliness meant strict moral conduct, prudence meant valuing the people's lives, and diligence meant serving public duties. At that time, administrative, judicial, and financial powers were concentrated in one official, so these three virtues were used to encourage and assess performance, serving as the basis for promotion and demotion. Now, these functions are separated. Civil and criminal lawsuits are handled by the judiciary, and financial matters are managed by the treasury. Administrative officials have simpler tasks and should be able to focus on promoting local interests, reforming and innovating, advancing education and culture, promoting public welfare and charity, benefiting industry and commerce, encouraging agriculture, developing water conservancy, and improving transportation, thus benefiting the people. This can be considered worthy of diligence. Diligence prevents negligence, and without negligence, there is no time for leisure and pleasure. Diligent public service transforms the people. This is called moral influence, which is most valued in the Chinese political system. However, it must come from the top down, as it is contrary to human nature to expect it from the bottom up. Qing Luxian Gong, a famous honest official, still relied on his superiors to promote rational learning and strict integrity. He once said, "The people of the world rely on the governors and viceroys for their livelihood, who in turn rely on the ministers and officials of the central government. The virtue of the provincial administrators depends on the governors and viceroys, who in turn rely on the ministers and officials of the central government. If the ministers and officials of the central government act correctly, then from the governors and viceroys down to the local officials, they will naturally become good officials." However, he could not avoid being deceived by powerful officials and suppressed honest officials. The practice of twisting the law is the same in all ages. In a corrupt world, corrupt officials can have the reality of corruption without the name of corruption, while honest officials can have the name of corruption without the reality of corruption. Black and white are confused, and some may think this is not the case, but politics lacks rationality, human feelings favor personal interests, right and wrong are reversed, promotions and demotions are unfair, and no one cares.

Cleanliness is even more difficult to achieve. It requires a spirit of self-discipline and restraint, and the salary must be sufficient to maintain an appropriate standard of living for the time. It also requires good governance and discipline, so that officials do not need to be greedy, nor do they want to be greedy. Only then can the practical effects of clean governance be seen. Otherwise, there will only be a few self-respecting individuals who are unwilling to be ashamed and live a clean life. Or, those who are wealthy use officialdom to establish a name for themselves, like Zhang Boxing in the early Qing Dynasty, who was known for his integrity. His family was wealthy, and he even took daily necessities from his home for his official duties. It is easy to appear clean in this way, but using private funds for public use is also commendable. In general, the ingrained habits of officialdom are difficult to eradicate, and the psychology of hypocrisy is evident. Therefore, there are those who "do not take what is due to them, but cleverly take other things; do not take from the local area, but seek compensation from other provinces; or have those they want to support and recommend repay them later, while they themselves seize a reputation for integrity; or allow their wives and servants to secretly accept bribes, while claiming to be honest officials." This is corruption in reality but cleanliness in name, another style. As for those who lack the power to be corrupt and cannot find shortcuts, they are not worthy of being called clean officials. Only those who have the power to be corrupt but are not corrupt, the opportunity to take but do not take, do not accept gifts in the dark, and are not taken by force, remain uncorrupted and unstained, can truly be called clean officials. Therefore, a clean official "is not one who takes nothing. If one cannot afford the means for daily use as an official or for his family, then there is no cleanliness. When forced by circumstances, such as insatiable demands from superiors and endless layers of exploitation, one's monthly salary is not enough to cover the expenses of social interactions, how can one maintain daily life? Those with weak wills will eventually succumb to corruption. This is the fault of corrupt governance, and clean governance is as difficult to achieve as waiting for the Yellow River to clear."

However, the cultivation of clean governance is not only a matter of individuals and governance, but is also limited by customs and influenced by economic conditions. All these factors are interconnected. The principles are complex and cannot be fully discussed in this article. As we are now focused on admonishing officials, I will briefly discuss the theory of clean governance to clarify its origins.

### Announcement from the Prime Minister's Residence in London: Major Changes in the British Cabinet; Lord Beaverbrook Appointed Minister of Supply; Will Promote Tank Production in the Future

London, Reuters, 30th - Last night, a statement was issued from the Prime Minister's residence, stating that the King had approved the following appointments: Lord Beaverbrook, formerly the Minister of Aircraft Production, was appointed Minister of Supply, remaining a member of the War Cabinet. Duncan, the former Minister of Supply, was appointed Minister of Commerce, also serving as Chairman of the Import Administration. Lyttelton, the former Minister of Commerce, was assigned to special overseas duties. The special arrangements of the former State Minister serving as Vice Chairman of the Defense Supply Committee and arbiter of priority issues were terminated immediately. All these issues will be handled by the Defense Department or the Production Administrator. Now that the War Transport Department has been established, the Secretary of Parliament of the Transport Department, Llewellyn, and the Secretary of Parliament of the Shipping Department, Shakespeare, have both resigned. The King has approved the appointments of Llewellyn and Shakespeare as Secretaries of Parliament of the War Transport Department. Since taking office as Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook has devoted his energy to planning everything, enabling British aircraft production to reach an unprecedented speed and providing the British Air Force with aircraft and new bombs to destroy Germany's operational capabilities. Now, as Minister of Supply, he will definitely promote the production of tanks, artillery, and ammunition in the coming months. The Prime Minister's emphasis on production issues is also evident here.

### British Aircraft Set New Records in Air Battles Last Week; Destroyed 183 Enemy Aircraft from the North Atlantic to the Indian Ocean

London, Reuters, 30th - The British Air Force set a new record for any week this year, destroying 183 enemy fighters in air battles from the North Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. The British also lost 65 aircraft, but most of the pilots did not die. If combined with what the Soviets announced, the enemy's losses in one week would be no less than 500 aircraft. In the skies over Britain, the enemy lost 11 aircraft at night, while the British had no losses. In the skies over Germany and occupied territories, German aircraft lost 96, and British aircraft lost 54. In the skies over the Middle East, enemy aircraft lost 73, and British aircraft lost 11. Last night, no enemy aircraft flew over the British coast, while the British Air Force flew over the English Channel twice yesterday. According to a communiqué, based on the results of the British Air Force's offensive actions in the Channel over the past few months, the new Hurricane and Spitfire aircraft are indeed better than the German Messerschmitt Me 109, which they claim to be the world's fastest and highest-flying aircraft. In the future, the British will have even more advanced Typhoon and Tempest aircraft than the Hurricane and Spitfire. Once they are deployed, German fighters will definitely be overshadowed unless they have newer models.

### British Aircraft Raids German Territory; Industrial Areas Bombed

TASS, Moscow, 30th: The following is the latest war report released here: (1) In the Minsk and Lusk areas, enemy vanguard tank units launched an offensive but have been prevented from advancing by us. Enemy tank units have suffered heavy losses. (2) In the Minsk and Baranovichi areas, enemy infantry is arriving in a steady stream to assist the tank units. Our army is fiercely engaging the enemy. In all these areas, our army, after counter-attacking, has prevented the enemy's main forces from advancing. (3) Large-scale tank warfare is still underway in the Lusk area. Our air force is assisting in the battle, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. (4) On the Soviet-Finnish border, enemy artillery and reconnaissance units are active. Enemy reconnaissance units attempted to break through our lines but were repelled. (5) On the 27th, an enemy submarine was sunk in the Gulf of Riga. On other fronts, our army is firmly holding its positions.

TASS, Moscow, 30th: The Soviet Information Bureau announced tonight the latest war report, stating: (1) On the 29th, Finnish and German troops launched a full-scale offensive along the line from the Barents Sea to the Gulf of Finland, attempting to break through our lines, but were repelled. Thousands of corpses were left behind during the retreat. Our artillery fire forced the enemy to retreat to their original positions. (2) In the Vilnius and Dvinsk areas, enemy mobile units attempted to attack our flanks and rear, but all failed. (3) At Salakas, Pabrade, and Kaunas (the capital of Lithuania), our army, after fierce fighting, has retreated to new positions. During the counter-attack, our army inflicted heavy casualties and equipment losses on the enemy. (4) In the Minsk area, our land and air forces have prevented the enemy's motorized and mechanized units from advancing. In this area, the enemy's mechanized units' contact with their base has been cut off by our air force's intense bombing, and they are currently in an extremely dangerous position. Our covering forces are fiercely preventing the enemy's motorized and infantry units from advancing along the Lida and Volkovysk line. (6) In the Lusk area, a large-scale mechanized unit battle is underway. In that area, the enemy's tank forces are being reinforced in a steady stream, but their attempts to break through the Novograd-Volynsk and Pytovka lines have already failed. At the same time, due to our air force and tank units' continuous counter-attacks, the enemy's tanks and motorized units have been routed. Prisoners of war claim that the enemy's tank division has been completely annihilated near Lida. Our naval air force is engaging enemy aircraft with extreme effectiveness, continuing to bomb enemy tank units and soldiers, and assisting our infantry in battle. In the Lusk area, our air force's assistance to the infantry in battle is particularly effective.

Reuters, London, 30th: Yesterday, from Murmansk on the Arctic Ocean to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, and from Minsk to Lusk, a border area occupied by the Soviet Union, heavy fighting continued throughout the day as German and Finnish forces attacked along the entire Finnish border, and the German navy attempted to land at Vyborg (ceded to the Soviet Union after the Soviet-Finnish War) in the Karelian Isthmus. According to a Soviet communique, this landing has been repelled. Today's Soviet communique stated that German tanks that had broken through in Minsk have been cut off and are in an extremely dangerous situation. However, it acknowledged that Soviet forces in Lithuania have withdrawn. In the Lusk area, German forces attempted to break through towards Zhitomir and Novograd-Volynsk in Ukraine, but the Soviet side claims to have defeated the German mechanized units. It is said that yesterday, the Soviet Union shot down 53 German aircraft, while the Soviet air force bravely assisted the army in battle, also losing 21 aircraft. On June 27, a German submarine was sunk in the Gulf of Riga.

### Great Battle Between Soviet and German Forces on 3,000 Square Mile Battlefield

Reuters, London, 30th: According to the latest news received here, large forces from both Germany and the Soviet Union, trained in modern tactics, are fiercely engaged in heavy fighting in Belarus and eastern Poland, deploying large tank units, artillery, and soldiers. The fighting has continued for a full day, with attacks and killings continuing in a war zone spanning approximately 3,000 square miles, from Minsk, the capital of Belarus, in the north, to Lviv, an important city in Poland, in the south. The Soviet side claims that Soviet forces are currently holding their positions. In this fierce battle, armored units, with their motorized units closely following behind, have penetrated deep into enemy lines ahead of the main force of infantry and artillery, resulting in intense fighting behind the armored units. Regarding this point, the German side reported last night that German tanks had crossed Minsk and reached the highway leading to Moscow, 400 miles away. However, the Soviet command claims that the German tank advance towards Minsk has been halted, and that Soviet forces are counter-attacking the main Nazi forces behind the tanks to prevent them from breaking through to meet up between Minsk and Baranovichi, 80 miles to the southwest. Berlin claims that, as a result of German tactics, large Soviet forces have been encircled in this area. Another major battlefield is around the city of Lusk, 250 miles southwest of Minsk (beyond the Pripet Marshes). The Soviet side claims that German tanks around Lusk have also been stopped. The latest Soviet communique states, "The enemy has suffered heavy damage." In the Lviv area in the south, fierce fighting is reported. The German side claims that German forces have captured stronger and newer fortifications west of the city of Lviv and are now advancing towards the city. At the same time, German forces have encircled two Soviet forces in the Bialystok area, far west of Minsk. The Soviet communique states that Soviet forces, after repelling the main German forces, are now advancing to meet up with the mechanized vanguard near Minsk.

United Press, Berlin, 30th: The German News Agency reported that German mechanized units continue to advance deep into Soviet territory, having crossed Minsk and reached Mishko on the Moscow highway. This achievement is the result of outflanking the Soviet forces in Minsk.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th: It was announced here this afternoon that, after fierce fighting with enemy forces, German forces have now broken through the Soviet army's resistance in the Rava area, destroying or capturing hundreds of tanks. In addition, 42 outdated 21 cm cannons have fallen into German hands.

### Lviv, a Key City in Southern Poland, Occupied by Germany

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th: The German High Command released a war report from the Führer's headquarters stating that Lviv was occupied by German forces this morning. Since 4:20 AM this morning, the German war flag has been flying over the city's citadel. Lviv is an important city in southern Poland.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th: Responsible sources, in supplementing the German war report, briefly stated that the German High Command has abandoned last week's reserved attitude and released the war report from the Eastern Front. The German Air Force has destroyed over 4,000 enemy aircraft within seven days of the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, which is astonishing. In comparison, during the Western Front fighting last summer, only 2,655 enemy aircraft were destroyed in 47 days. The Soviet Air Force, which the world viewed as a threat on the Eastern Front, has had its prestige shaken. Germany has destroyed or captured 2,233 armored vehicles, including 46 heavy tanks weighing 52 tons. The German war report includes three main points: (1) In the Battle of Lviv, elite German and Soviet units engaged, and the Soviet lines have been shaken. (2) Near Bialystok on the upper reaches of the Narew River, German forces annihilated two elite Soviet armies. German armored units have crossed Minsk and reached the highway leading to Moscow. (3) Soviet forces in the Baltic countries are collapsing in disarray, and German forces have reached Daugavpils. The Soviet retreat route has been cut off. The German Air Force has achieved air superiority on the Eastern Front, and German armored units and anti-tank guns have shown their superiority over Soviet forces.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th: Lviv, which German forces occupied this morning, is the largest city in Galicia. Before 1918, it belonged to Austria-Hungary. During World War I, the city was occupied by Russian forces in August 1914. It was briefly liberated during the Battle of Lviv from June 17 to June 22, 1915. On November 2, 1918, it was occupied by Ukrainians, and 20 days later it fell into Polish hands. After the dissolution of Poland, it became part of the Soviet Union. Lviv is an important industrial and commercial center, with breweries and sugar factories, and a population of 370,000.

United Press, Berlin, 30th: The High Command issued information today from the Führer's headquarters stating that German forces have occupied Lviv and destroyed more Soviet aircraft yesterday. Last night, 77 Soviet aircraft were destroyed in the Minsk area, and 31 were destroyed in Lviv, including 14 on the ground. Along the entire Eastern Front, 48 Soviet aircraft were shot down in aerial combat, and 114 Soviet aircraft parked on the ground were damaged.

### German Aircraft Have Intruded into Soviet Territory 324 Times in the Past Six Months

TASS, Moscow, 30th: The Deputy Director of the Soviet Information Bureau, Lozovsky, received reporters for the first time on June 28 and delivered a speech stating: "As you all know, the Soviet Union has now become the target of provocative aggression by German fascism. The German side is relying on fabrications and lies to cover up its illegal attacks. Hitler's declaration of war against the Soviet Union is 100% self-deception. The Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, refuted the lies spread by Hitler and the German Foreign Minister in his radio address on June 22. However, because there are too many rumors, it is impossible to refute them one by one. Although lies can poison the atmosphere, for the sake of public health, we must rebut them at any time. Regarding the nonsensical remarks fabricated by these gentlemen, I will give three examples as proof: (1) Hitler insisted in his declaration that Soviet pilots had violated German airspace, intending to show that they considered themselves masters of German territory. However, the facts prove otherwise. From January 1, 1941, to June 22, German aircraft violated the Soviet border 324 times. Soviet aircraft only accidentally violated German airspace eight times. In January and March 1941, the Soviet Union sent notes to the German side, pointing out the facts of German aircraft violating the border. Later, the number of border violations increased daily. Soviet officials sent a note to the German ambassador to the Soviet Union on April 21, stating that German aircraft had violated the border a total of 80 times during the period from March 27 to April 21. However, this kind of communication was still ineffective. On June 21, the Soviet Council of People's Commissars sent another note to the German ambassador, pointing out that German aircraft had violated the border 180 times during the period from April 19 to June 19. Several times, German aircraft penetrated deep into Soviet territory to a depth of 100 to 150 kilometers. The purpose of these aircraft violations was to conduct reconnaissance of Soviet territory, and certainly not due to German pilots getting lost. From this point of view, all of Hitler's claims are distortions of the facts. (2) The German Foreign Minister claimed in his memorandum of June 23 that the Soviet Union had incited Turkey against Germany in March 1941 and provided Turkey with various assurances. Although this statement is extremely cunning, it lacks common sense. The Soviet Union had declared that if Turkey were attacked, the Soviet Union would remain neutral. Currently, Germany is at war with the Soviet Union, and several countries, such as Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, and even the United States, are strictly maintaining neutrality. From the German point of view, all those who declare neutrality are taking a hostile attitude towards Germany. (3) Regarding the issue of the straits, we do not know Hitler's knowledge of music, but in his declaration, Hitler sang a high-pitched tune, claiming that Molotov had talked to him about ceding the straits when he was in Berlin. Regarding this point, the Soviet government has stated that it is absolutely not in accordance with the facts. This kind of rumor is nothing more than a way to deceive people who do not understand the Soviet Union's basic policies. At the same time, Britain is attempting to incite Turkey against the Soviet Union and arouse the antipathy of the Turkish people."

### Soviet and German Exchange of Diplomatic Personnel; Negotiations Underway

TASS, Moscow, 30th: After the Deputy Director of the Soviet Information Bureau received foreign journalists for the first time yesterday and delivered a speech, he also answered questions from the journalists. One journalist asked: "When the whole world understands that the German side is preparing for war, why is the Soviet TASS still saying that the German side is abiding by its commitments?" He replied: "Judging from the recent facts, the Soviet government's policy is extremely clear. The Soviet government is doing everything in its power to maintain the German-Soviet commitments. The purpose of TASS's statement is to force the German side to state whether it is abiding by the treaty. TASS's statement was not published in the newspapers of Germany and its slave countries, which shows that Germany is not prepared to abide by the treaty. The treacherous behavior of the German side proves that the German government is arbitrarily 'revising' international law. The purpose of signing non-aggression pacts is also to prepare to launch a sudden attack on the signatory country." Later, the journalist asked him to describe the actual war situation in detail. Regarding this point, he replied: "As you all know, the German side is using false information to confuse the international community. This kind of information is purely fabricated from beginning to end. You must also know this. We do not want to invent information. We want to report the facts to the people of the world. Our information may be slightly delayed, but this is because we must verify it before publishing it." Regarding the fate of the personnel of the Soviet embassy in Germany and the German embassy in the Soviet Union, he said: "Negotiations for the exchange of diplomatic personnel are underway. The people responsible for this negotiation are the Bulgarian legation in Moscow (representing the German side) and the Swedish legation in Berlin (representing the Soviet Union)." Then, after discussing the publication of the war report of the Soviet Information Bureau with the journalists, the meeting ended successfully.

### Random Talks on the European War (65): The Reality of Britain's Hard Fighting

This is an important method, which, even if it cannot eliminate the extremely wealthy, can greatly reduce the number of wealthy people and intensify equalization.

As for extreme poverty, there are already many methods to alleviate it. The number of unemployed people has been reduced to less than one-third of what it was before the war. Wartime wages are also higher than before the war, and both husband and wife in a family have income, and even children can earn money.

Soldiers' pay is not very high, but in terms of clothing, food, and housing, soldiers and their families often receive far more than before the war.

Therefore, the economic and social changes of the war have brought the two extremes of wealth and poverty closer together. The people who have the most difficult time are the middle class, especially the low-paid white-collar class, that is, the small-salary employees.

Wealthy and well-off families, although they inevitably have to greatly reduce their living standards, can still get by. The poor have government assistance, either attracting them to do wartime work with higher wages as indirect assistance, or providing direct assistance through wartime relief.

If their houses are destroyed by enemy aircraft, the government will bear the cost of evacuating or sheltering them if necessary, until they have the means to rent a house, and the government often shares part of the rent.

The situation of the white-collar class is more miserable. For example, clerks and others, because they are not essential, have not had their salaries increased, but have been greatly affected by rising prices.

If they are drafted into the army, unless they are fortunate enough to be commissioned, the pay and allowances they receive are not comparable to their usual salaries, and they will inevitably be in trouble trying to maintain their family life with this.

If their houses are destroyed, they receive the same treatment as poor families. The authorities first shelter them in rest centers and provide them with free meals and accommodation until they can move elsewhere.

If the white-collar class has no relatives or friends to turn to, their suffering is truly indescribable. If they do not have to rely on government relief, they must live the same simple life as most of the poor, whose living standards are lower. Furthermore, although the subsidies they receive for destroyed houses are theoretically the same, a large part of the middle class's income is used for family expenses, so they still feel deeply hurt.

Therefore, in equalization, there are also some inequalities. This is nothing more than a warning that the abolition of social inequality and the class system is limited. Moreover, in the minds of the lower-middle class, the concept of class is no weaker than that of the upper class. It will take a long time and education to eliminate or reduce this distinction.

In the political sphere, although Britain's wartime revolution is not very obvious, its meaning is just as important. Britain is clearly moving towards left-leaning politics. The parties do not compete for by-elections of parliamentarians, but rather send members of the same party to fill the vacancies. However, British political experts all agree that national public opinion has indeed moved to the left and is still in progress.

This change, although not seen in Parliament, is clearly reflected in the Cabinet. According to the strength of each party in Parliament, the Labor Party occupies more seats in the entire government and the War Cabinet's small Cabinet than any other party. Under Churchill's revolution, although the Labor Party did not actually gain political dominance, it has gained a powerful political position.

But is this leftward shift in Britain moving towards socialization?

No. Even Labor Party leaders do not believe this will happen. It should be understood that although there are Labor Party leaders who belong entirely to the Marxist socialist school, there are very few voters in the labor sector, even in industrial areas, who elect the Labor Party in order to overthrow the capitalist system and replace it with socialism.

The British Labor Party has repeatedly realized that the people do not need Marx's socialism. What they want is social reform and better wages. Therefore, the Labor Party must instruct their campaigning members, "Be careful not to talk about socialism on the podium, it is of no use."

What Labor Party leaders expect and perhaps can achieve is the implementation of some degree of state socialism in several key industries and public utilities. The Minister of Labor, Bevin, who is generally considered to be the most promising successor to Prime Minister Churchill, has his own opinions. He advocates the nationalization of all minerals, transportation, general public utilities, and credit, but this must take time and cannot be achieved overnight. The actual intermediate step that can be determined is for the state to exercise closer control over the Bank of England.

But these are just plans. The details of Britain's political leftward shift cannot be absolutely predicted in advance. I recently asked Morrison, the current Minister of Home Affairs and Public Security, the most popular in the labor movement, whether Britain after the war will be socialist or national socialist? He replied very definitely that in his opinion, neither is possible. He said that Britain will become a "truly free democratic country."

After extensive investigation, the reporter feels that his conclusion is insightful. All sectors in Britain are fighting for freedom, not for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie or the proletariat. The financial community in London's control over government finances will inevitably be greatly reduced, or even completely eliminated.

Labor will have a greater say in industry and politics, but the result will still be British-style, democratic, traditional, and even conservative.

The British want to preserve the essence of the past, and they must integrate it into a more civilized social plan based on a more equitable distribution of property.

Perhaps this is the most accurate definition of the British revolution!

### Soviet Union Announces One Week of War News; Germany Fails to Achieve Blitzkrieg Victory; Frontline Communications Cut Off

TASS, Moscow, 30th: Hitler and his supporters, because they have never encountered difficulties in this imperialist war, recently claimed again in a radio broadcast that they had captured and destroyed 2,000 Soviet tanks, 600 cannons, and 4,000 aircraft in seven days, and captured 40,000 Red Army soldiers. During the same period, the German side only lost 150 aircraft, and said nothing about losses of tanks, cannons, etc. This kind of boastful rumor is not worth laughing at. The actual situation is very different from what Hitler claimed. The German side concentrated 170 divisions on the Soviet border, of which at least one-third were tank and motorized divisions. The German side took advantage of the fact that the Soviet army had not reached the border and started the war without authorization, attacking our border by theft. During the first day of fighting, our army lacked both tanks and cannons. The war progressed into the second day, and only our forward infantry units participated. On the third and fourth days, our regular army only made contact with the enemy in certain locations. Due to this situation, the enemy was able to continuously occupy Bialystok, Grodno, Brest, Vilnius, and Kaunas. The German side originally intended to block the deployment of our army within a few days, and to occupy Kyiv and Smolensk within a week using blitzkrieg tactics. However, the facts prove that the enemy did not achieve its goal. Our army is still deploying smoothly, and the so-called blitzkrieg attacks on Kyiv and Smolensk have also been thwarted. After seven or eight days of fierce resistance from our army, the German side lost 2,500 tanks and 1,500 aircraft, and 30,000 German officers and soldiers were captured. During the same period, the Soviet side lost 850 aircraft and 900 tanks, and 15,000 people were missing or captured. This is the actual situation on the front lines, which can refute the inaccuracy of German radio propaganda. Judging from the war situation in the past eight days, we can reach the following conclusions: the blitzkrieg victory expected by the German command has failed, the German frontline communications have been cut off, and the German offensive spirit has been frustrated. On the other hand, although the deployment of Soviet troops was slightly delayed, they were still able to defend Soviet territory, inflict heavy damage on the enemy, and exhaust them.

### Soviet Air Force Personnel Fight Heroically

Reuters, Moscow, 30th: A Soviet communique stated that the air force personnel led by Comrade Rodakov are now heroically resisting the enemy. In total, the German aircraft shot down in air combat in the past three days have reached 13 bombers and fighter planes. Also, the squadron led by Comrade Karabinitz shot down five German aircraft in a certain air battle without suffering any losses to its own squadron. At dawn, our reconnaissance aircraft discovered German tank units advancing rapidly in a certain village. After receiving the report, the commander ordered his subordinates to cut off the German tanks' communications. Soviet bomber squadrons also set out to engage the enemy. As a result of this battle, our aircraft and tanks were superior, and the German army was defeated and retreated. A total of 15 German tanks were destroyed.

### Vichy Government Announces Severance of Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union; Diplomats to Return Home; Albania Declares War on Soviet Union

Reuter, Vichy, 30th. The French government has severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union this morning. French Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Darlan has delivered the notification to the Soviet Ambassador to France, Bogomolov. The French government subsequently issued the following official gazette: "The French government has determined that Soviet diplomatic and consular officials have engaged in activities detrimental to order and security in France. Therefore, it has decided to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The government has now instructed the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union to notify the Soviet government of this decision." Soviet diplomatic officials in France and French diplomatic officials in the Soviet Union are now preparing to return to their respective countries.

Associated Press, Tirana, 30th. Officials here announced yesterday that Albania has declared war on the Soviet Union.

### Soviet Paratroopers Land in Finland and Romania

Havas, Finnish Capital, 29th. A local radio station has just announced that Soviet paratroopers have reportedly landed behind Finnish military positions. All citizens are required to cooperate in defense and report any suspicious individuals to the authorities immediately.

Havas, Romanian Capital, 29th. The German-Romanian Joint Command announced in its war report that fierce fighting continues unabated from the Bukovina region to the Black Sea coast.

### Britain Expresses Determination to Cooperate with the Soviet Union; U.S. Ambassador Visits Soviet Foreign Minister

Reuter, London, 30th. Sir Stafford Cripps, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, carries a special letter from the British government to the Soviet government on his return. After introducing members of the British military and economic delegations to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, the British Ambassador declared to Molotov that he was instructed by the British government to convey its sincere desire to assist in the victory of the Soviet army and its determination to fully cooperate in the common struggle.

Reuter, Moscow, 30th. U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov yesterday for approximately one hour.

### Pope Delivers Radio Address

Associated Press, Vatican City, 30th. Pope Pius XII delivered his most pessimistic address since the outbreak of war via radio to the world yesterday. The day was the commemoration of the martyrdom of Saints Peter and Paul. Unexpectedly, the Pope did not mention any hope for peace. The Vatican believes that he is preparing to cope with the long-term suffering of the war. Church officials generally believe that this speech, ostensibly the most pastoral broadcast by any Pope on the radio, in reality contains political implications and possible interpretations. His reference to the "ascension of atheism" is widely understood to refer to the heresy of the Soviet Union. Most Vatican observers believe that the speech contains criticism of world leaders, stating, "All mankind is as children before God. Even the most experienced leaders can only judge things with shortsighted eyes. God observes things with the unchanging center of the universe, while the leaders of various countries only have a limited perspective of a few years. God has the far-sighted perspective of generations."

### German Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Discusses Objectives of War Against the Soviet Union

Associated Press, Berlin, 30th. A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry stated frankly today that Germany's war with the Soviet Union aims to overthrow Bolshevism, not to restore Imperial Russia. Therefore, the wishful thinking of anti-Soviet White Russians has been shattered. When asked if Germany would allow White Russians the opportunity to organize legions to help Germany attack the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front, the spokesperson replied that Germany fears it cannot allow the organization of a White Russian army. Aside from the issue of Germany attacking the Soviet Union, organizing a White Russian army is also very difficult.

### Turkish President Returns to Capital; To Receive French Representative; Implementation of Pre-War Treaties; Menemencioglu Continues Discussions with Turkish Authorities

Reuter, Ankara, 30th. The Turkish President returned here today and is expected to receive Vichy Minister Menemencioglu. At that time, Menemencioglu will present the letter he carries from Pétain to the Turkish President. Turkish protocols stipulate that all official actions must take place in the Turkish capital. Therefore, the Turkish President did not receive Menemencioglu during his stay for several days at his summer residence in Yalova. Yesterday, a French spokesperson stated that Menemencioglu was in Ankara to discuss the withdrawal of Vichy troops from Syria. It is rumored that Menemencioglu's trip is to consult with Turkey on allowing weapons to transit through Turkey into Syria. The general public believes that Menemencioglu's efforts in this regard will not succeed. The former German Consul in Beirut, Rosse, and several staff members have arrived here, showing that Germany has not abandoned its concerns about Syria. German sources say that since the collapse of France, Rosse has been actively engaged in anti-British propaganda among Arabs and Syrians. Berlin Radio announced today that further news will be released regarding the activities of the Arab guerrilla leader, Sakhut Zogi, in the disturbances in Palestine. Local people believe that Sakhut Zogi may be related to the Arab mercenary corps currently being recruited by General Dentz.

Havas, Vichy, 29th. Cabinet Deputy Menemencioglu continued talks with Turkish authorities today. However, responsible parties have not disclosed what was discussed. Diplomatic observers believe that Menemencioglu's trip is to discuss the implementation of various treaties signed between France and Turkey before the war with Turkish authorities.

Reuter, London, 30th. The Independent French News Agency reports from Istanbul that four Vichy diplomats stationed in Turkey have resigned within a week, including Smaila, the counselor of the embassy, and the secretary and agent of the consulate general. This has disrupted Vichy's diplomatic affairs in Turkey. Furthermore, the number of French colonies leaning towards the Free French movement is increasing daily. It is feared that more officials will resign in the future. This is also the reason why Vichy Minister Menemencioglu is visiting Turkey.

Havas, Ankara, 29th. Officials stated that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu will not personally go to Berlin to participate in the ceremony for the exchange of ratification documents for the German-Turkish friendship treaty. Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sigi Jia, has departed for Berlin to represent Turkey in this matter.
English Ships Continue to be Sunk in North Atlantic

Reuter, Berlin, 30th. It was announced here today that German submarines recently sank five British ships in the North Atlantic, totaling 25,400 tons, including one British auxiliary cruiser. In total, German submarines have recently sunk 96,100 tons of British ships in the North Atlantic.

### Turkey Hastens Construction of Two Railways to Iran and Iraq

Havas, Istanbul, 29th. The Turkish government has recently decided to speed up the construction of two railways, one to Iran and one to Iraq.

Havas, Ankara, 29th. The semi-official "Anatolia" news agency has issued a message stating that rumors that British Foreign Secretary Eden will meet with the Turkish Ambassador to inform him that Britain is deeply concerned about Turkey's permission for German troops to transit, and that Turkey is about to abandon its neutral policy, are all denied by the local government.

### Extensive Scope of British-Spanish Talks

Reuter, London, 30th. Reuters diplomatic correspondent heard from responsible sources in London that the British Ambassador to Madrid, Hoare, had lengthy talks with Franco on Saturday and Sunday. Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer was also present. The scope of the discussions was quite broad. The riots near the British Embassy were also among the topics discussed. Franco expressed sympathy to the British Ambassador regarding the riots and assured him that the Spanish government strongly disapproved of the riots, was determined to punish the rioters, and would take all necessary steps to prevent future riots.

### Owen Lattimore En Route to China Praises Chinese and American Leaders; Says Chiang is Symbol of Chinese Unity; Roosevelt Has Become Sole Leader of America

Associated Press, Washington, 30th. Owen Lattimore, the newly appointed political advisor to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, said yesterday that China and the United States are fortunate to have Generalissimo Chiang and President Roosevelt as leaders. He said that Generalissimo Chiang is a symbol of all Chinese and of Chinese unity, and President Roosevelt is a symbol of American leadership. He believes that President Roosevelt's recommendation to assist Generalissimo Chiang is a symbol of equality in the ideals pursued by China and the United States. This move also represents a great increase in the confidence of the people of China and the United States in the shared interests of the two countries. In four years of war, China is fighting to protect its ideals, and the United States has felt the need to increase its aid to China. Lattimore has lived in China for many years and is fluent in several Chinese dialects. He said that China represents the vanguard of various ideals, which are respected and defended by the American people. Lattimore is scheduled to leave San Francisco on July 8, taking a clipper via Hong Kong to Chongqing. His wife and ten-year-old child will remain in Baltimore.

Washington, 29th, Special Dispatch. People here believe that Lattimore's appointment as political advisor to China's Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek is very important. It is widely believed that cooperation between the relevant governments and the Chinese government will be further expressed, and Lattimore's appointment as Chiang's advisor was recommended by President Roosevelt, and is the first person Roosevelt has recommended to Chiang, so all parties attach particular importance to this matter. In the past, Germany and Italy both sent advisors to serve under the Chinese government. Now the United States is doing the same, showing the depth of American concern for China's war of resistance. Today, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Lattimore to ask about his feelings. He said that he personally felt very honored for this position, and he was especially pleased to be able to serve beside China's wise leader. Lattimore lived in China for twelve years in his childhood, and between 1919 and 1937, he still traveled frequently between China and the United States. When he goes to China, he not only does not feel like he is leaving the country, but also feels like he is returning home, which shows the depth of his goodwill towards China. Lattimore continued to tell reporters that he was very excited to be able to personally participate in China's war of resistance this time. Lattimore speaks fluent Chinese, with a strong Beijing accent. He said the word (war) in pure Chinese, so Lattimore can talk to Generalissimo Chiang in person without a translator after he comes to China. Lattimore is known in the United States for being pro-China. During his stay in China, he specialized in writing about China, including Mongolia, Manchuria, Xinjiang, etc. Therefore, he knows very few people among the Nationalist government, and he and his wife have never met Generalissimo Chiang. Several weeks ago, Lattimore visited President Roosevelt several times, which must have been related to this matter. At the last meeting between Lattimore and Roosevelt last week, Currie, Roosevelt's representative to Chongqing, was also present. When Lattimore mentioned Sino-American relations, he said that China and the United States are fortunate to have President Roosevelt and Generalissimo Chiang, the two greatest leaders in the world, at this critical time. There is no third person in other parts of the world. Roosevelt is the symbol of American leadership, while Generalissimo Chiang is the symbol of the unity of all Chinese and all parts of China. Lattimore believes that his appointment as Generalissimo Chiang's political advisor shows that China and the United States have the same views, which is what the two peoples and their leaders are striving for, and shows that the people of China and the United States have more and more recognized that the interests of the two countries are the same. He said that China has been fighting a bloody war for four years to defend its ideals, and the United States is gradually recognizing the importance of helping China. China is in the vanguard of the ideals that the United States loves, needs, and defends. Although the world's attention is now mostly focused on Europe, the United States' aid to China is not less than its aid to Britain. The importance of China's war is the same as that of Britain's war, and he hopes for close understanding and cooperation between China and the United States.

Havas, Tokyo, 30th. The press and government authorities here have not yet commented on U.S. President Roosevelt's recommendation of Far East expert Owen Lattimore as political advisor to the Chinese Nationalist government. The newspapers only published this news in an unimportant position with a few lines of text. However, judging from their tone in commenting on the German-Soviet war, the newspapers all believe that the United States and Britain will take the opportunity to intensify their pressure on Japan. Their only hope lies in Germany's rapid defeat of the Soviet Union.

### Former U.S. President Hoover Delivers Speech Advocating Aid to China and Britain But Says U.S. Must Not Participate in War

Havas, New York, 30th. Former President Hoover delivered a radio address in Chicago last night, clarifying a plan to maintain peace in the Americas. The main points are as follows: 1. Do our best to assist China and Britain, but do not send troops to the war zones. 2. Strengthen military preparations to defend the Western Hemisphere, but do not provoke others. 3. The responsibility for war and peace should be borne entirely by the Senate and the House of Representatives. 4. Abandon the concept of ideological war, such as forcing other countries to accept "four freedoms." 5. Call on other countries to follow the United States and share freedom. 6. Use endless resources as a backing to promote a just and lasting peace, so that all exhausted countries can listen. 7. Change the idea of opposing peace conferences. In addition, the United States should fulfill its promise to assist the Soviet Union, but it is wrong to participate in the war because of this.

### U.S. Communist Party Advocates Aid to Soviet Union

Reuter, New York, 30th. The National Committee of the U.S. Communist Party recently issued a declaration advocating full aid to Britain, the Soviet Union, and all those who are hostile to Hitler. At the same time, the democratic freedoms and economic standards enjoyed by the American people must be maintained and expanded. Aiding China and not funding Japan is also included in the committee's anti-Hitler action program. According to a Washington dispatch from New York, some influential military strategists advocate consulting with the Soviet Union to give American aircraft the convenience of using Soviet air bases in Siberia opposite Alaska, which can be arranged in the same way as with Britain.

### Japanese Newspaper Reports Germany Hopes Japan Will Wage War Against Soviet Union

Havas, Tokyo, 30th. The Kokumin Shimbun recently published a special dispatch from Berlin stating that the German government and public all hope that Japan will participate in Germany's war against the Soviet Union. The German side is now quietly waiting to see what concrete actions Japan will take. The Nazi Party believes that Bolshevism is the "common enemy of mankind" and that Japan will be willing to cooperate in eliminating it. Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima said that Japan should temporarily adopt an extremely cautious attitude and closely study the German situation.

### U.S. President Signs Order to Induct New Recruits; Number Will Reach 900,000; Authorizes Secretary of War to Implement Starting in July

Associated Press, Hyde Park, 30th. President Roosevelt, in order to "national interests," signed an executive order yesterday ordering that 900,000 newly drafted men be allocated to the U.S. Army this year starting on July 1 to replace the enlisted personnel whose terms of service will expire this autumn. The order authorizes Secretary of War Stimson to call up the new troops within twelve months starting on July 1 if necessary. The order indicates that the trained men can be replaced after a one-year term, but Chief of Staff Marshall has announced that the term of service for trainees may exceed one year. Extending the term of service beyond twelve months will require the approval of Congress.

### Filipinos in America Pledge Allegiance to United States

If war breaks out, Filipinos should be allowed to join the U.S. military and fight for the United States to respect their country."

### U.S. House Army Committee Criticizes Government

International News Service, Washington, 30th. The House Army Committee criticized the government yesterday for mishandling the national defense process and requested the appointment of a national defense president. The committee submitted a report to Congress, pointing out three major government errors: shortsightedness, failure to accomplish anything, and lack of cooperation. The committee conducted a two-month secret investigation into the rearmament movement. The report was based on this investigation and was passed by the Army Committee by a vote of sixteen to nine.

### Japanese Military and Political Leaders Continue to Discuss Foreign Policy

It is also said that one American is missing and the rest were rescued. The Navy Department announced on Saturday and Sunday that three Marine officers and 60 soldiers had set off for London because the work of the U.S. Embassy in London had greatly increased, and an office was added, so the Marines were sent to be responsible for traffic between the offices and fire prevention, to reduce the burden on the embassy staff.

### Paderewski Dies in America; Master Pianist and Polish Statesman

Reuter, New York, 30th. Ignacy Jan Paderewski, the first Prime Minister of the Polish Republic and one of the most famous pianists of the era, died after a week of pneumonia. He was 80 years old. Paderewski was born on November 6, 1860 in a village in Podolia, Russian Poland. His father was a land agent, and he spent most of his later years in prison in order to restore his country's freedom. His maternal grandfather was a Polish patriot who was exiled to Siberia, so his mother was born there. Because she spent her childhood in snow and ice, she was in poor health and died shortly after giving birth to Paderewski. Although Paderewski had held the belief of restoring his country from an early age, he suffered repeated setbacks. It was not until the outbreak of the First World War at the age of 54 that the dream of an independent Poland had a chance of realization. Seeing that the opportunity had arrived, he completely abandoned his artistic research and devoted himself to the work of liberating his country. In 1917, he organized a volunteer army among the Poles in America. After the United States entered the war, he was recognized as the representative of the Polish people in the United States. President Wilson's famous Fourteen Points, issued on January 8, 1918, specifically focused on the issue of Polish independence in its thirteenth point. Paderewski's struggle had not yet achieved results at this point. When he went to London and Paris, he was told that Poland would not be invited to attend the peace conference unless it could establish a government representing the entire nation within Poland. Paderewski immediately rushed to Warsaw and cooperated sincerely with Piłsudski, one in charge of military affairs and the other in charge of diplomacy. After repeated efforts, they were able to win victory at the Paris Peace Conference. An independent Poland had become a reality and gained an outlet to the sea. After taking office as the first Prime Minister, he eventually disagreed with Piłsudski and resigned on December 9, 1919. In 1921, he left Poland and politics and returned to his villa in Boisson, near Lausanne, Switzerland, which he had purchased before the war to recover. At this time, he had dedicated all his savings to the country and was once again a poor man. Forced by livelihood, he returned to America to perform piano, where he was welcomed everywhere. In the first season, he earned 100,000 pounds sterling. Since then, he has been known as a master pianist all over the world. He was married twice. His first wife was Ms. Kassak, a childhood sweetheart, who died a year after their marriage. His second marriage took place in 1899, and his wife, Baroness Rosen, also died in 1934.

### British Planes Bombard Syrian Territory; General Dentz's Private Residence; Nebek Confirmed as British-Occupied; Syrian Refugees Continue to Flee to Turkey

Reuters, Cairo, 30th - A British communiqué released here last night stated that British forces had achieved partial progress in various areas of Syria and that the fighting was continuing. General Dentz's proclamation, however, declared, "The British army's efforts to break our resistance have not been successful," but admitted that Vichy forces in the southern Lebanese mountains had withdrawn from some outposts under artillery cover. The proclamation also stated, "British forces have made contact with our forces in the Nebek area, and enemy troops who penetrated our lines northwest of Damascus have been heavily attacked, suffering severe damage and retreating. The French garrison in Palmyra was heavily attacked on June 28th but continues to resist bravely and launched a partial counterattack. Enemy planes bombed Tair Sole, causing slight casualties among civilians." The Vichy News Agency subsequently reported that Nebek, 35 miles northeast of Damascus, had been occupied by Allied forces. Italian refugees fleeing Syria are now continuously arriving in Istanbul, taking long-distance buses to the Bulgarian capital. A dispatch from the Independent French News Agency in Istanbul stated that postal communication between the area and Europe has been completely cut off, with communication only possible with Britain and the Soviet Union. Due to the difficulty of communication with Europe, Turkey is currently accelerating the construction of two railway lines to Iran and Iraq.

Haitong News Agency, Vichy, 30th - The French military headquarters released a military report last night stating that the British army's attempts to break the French army's resistance had been ineffective. British warships continued to bombard French positions along the coast. French forces in the southern Lebanese mountains have retreated under the cover of artillery. The situation in Panzer Gorge has not changed. Enemy troops who penetrated French lines northwest of Damascus suffered heavy losses. The defenders of Palmyra, although bombarded by British planes, continued to resist bravely and launched a counterattack on June 28th. The French air force coordinated with ground troops. Tair Sole was bombed by British planes, causing slight casualties among civilians. Forty British soldiers have been captured in the past two days, including one colonel. It is solemnly declared that all prisoners were captured by French forces, not German forces. Only French forces are defending Syria.

Havas, Beirut, 29th - British planes bombed the private residence of General Dentz, the French High Commissioner for Syria and Lebanon, at 5:45 PM today, dropping a total of fifteen bombs. General Dentz and his wife were not at home, so they were unharmed. Five people were killed and four injured. According to sources here, there are no military targets in the vicinity of General Dentz's private residence, and it is the location of various charitable organizations. The French Red Cross meets there every day to carry out relief work, but fortunately, no meeting was held today.

United Press, Cairo, 30th - A Royal Air Force communiqué last night stated that Australian Royal Air Force American fighter planes shot down and destroyed six Vichy "Martin" bombers. These French aircraft were attempting to attack British forces near Palmyra, an air force base and transportation hub in Syria. There were no losses to British fighter planes. The communiqué stated, "The Royal Air Force bombed warehouses near Baalbek and other military targets in Rayak, with considerable success."

Reuters, Cairo, 30th - The British Middle East Headquarters issued the following communiqué today: There has been no change in Libya. In Syria, our forces have completed the encirclement of Palmyra. Our forces continue to advance in Damascus and the coastal areas. The situation in the central area is largely unchanged. According to the official French news agency, Beirut was subjected to three heavy bombings between 10 and 11 PM last night, killing four civilians and injuring six. Meanwhile, news from London indicates that British authorities are now transporting 400 tons of food to Damascus daily, starting from the day the city was occupied. This news comes from responsible sources in London, which shows that rumors that the British are allowing the residents of Damascus to starve are unfounded.

### Twenty-Nine Americans Arrested on Suspicion of Espionage

Reuters, New York, 30th - Twenty-nine people have been arrested here on suspicion of espionage. This is the largest number of arrests of espionage suspects since the Espionage Act was passed.

### American Aviation Expert Discusses Air Force Power

United Press, New York, 30th - American aviation expert Savsky recently published an article arguing that naval escorts alone cannot break the German blockade of Britain. Savsky pointed out that the greatest threat to navigation currently comes from the air. Bombers and destroyers are more important than the navy in protecting the sea lanes of communication from America to Britain, the third and last route. Savsky's article stated that the American people and their leaders now recognize the great importance of air power in the development and outcome of this war, but this recognition did not begin with the outbreak of the war. The significant losses inflicted on British merchant ships by Hitler's long-range bombers may have been a factor in prompting this awareness among Americans. Semi-official sources have indicated that at least half of the goods shipped from the United States to Britain have been sunk by aircraft. The proportion of ships sunk is increasing daily, as Hitler has been able to gradually send more four-engine Focke-Wulf Condor aircraft into the British blockade line. US Secretary of War Henry Stimson recently stated in a broadcast that the British Isles are not only under direct threat of air strikes but also under threat of supply shortages. Not only military supplies but also the food needed by the British people is gradually being cut off by the Nazi blockade. Therefore, we must not ignore the fact that bombers and destroyers are far more important than the navy in overcoming the German threat in the Atlantic Ocean when considering the widely discussed convoy issue. It should be known that the air force can engage enemy aircraft in the skies above the sea, but the navy cannot. Aircraft can also detect and destroy submarines, and their effectiveness is far greater than that of surface warships. Moreover, aircraft have strong speed, observation, and combat capabilities, making them the commanders protecting and directing the actions of surface warships. Convoys cannot reduce losses and achieve time efficiency without the assistance of the air force.

### An Analysis of Japanese Naval Power

—Translated from the London Daily Telegraph—

The tonnage of the Japanese Navy fleet ranks third in the world, behind only the United States and Britain.

From Japan's point of view, the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 was clearly designed to keep Japan in this inferior position. This feeling persisted until the London Naval Conference of 1935-36. At that time, the Japanese delegation proposed a complex plan, the so-called "common increase in quotas," which, as the name suggests, was a request for equal fleets among the three countries. However, considering Japan's particularly advantageous strategic position and the lack of distant overseas territories, its superiority at sea has already surpassed that of Britain and the United States.

After Japan's proposal failed, it withdrew from the conference and has since been in cahoots with the "Berlin-Rome Axis." At the same time, the government of that country kept the situation of shipbuilding and general naval construction a closely guarded secret. Once involved, there were suspicions of espionage. Under such absolute secrecy, it is naturally difficult to know the exact number of the country's new and old ships, but the following list of ships is not far from the truth.

Japan currently has ten battleships in active service. Among them, the "Kongo," "Haruna," "Kirishima," and "Hiei" are sister ships, each with a displacement of 29,330 tons, launched between 1912 and 1913. They have been greatly renovated over the years. Although the "Hiei" was converted into a training ship in accordance with the London Naval Treaty of 1930 and was not included in the regular fleet, it is generally believed that the ship has now been restored to its former glory. Each of the four ships is equipped with eight 14-inch guns and ten 6-inch guns.

The "Fuso" and "Yamashiro" were both launched between 1913 and 1914, and the "Ise" and "Hyuga" were both launched between 1916 and 1917. The displacement of the four ships is the same as that of the "Kongo." The former two are equipped with twelve 14-inch guns and sixteen 5.5-inch guns. The "Nagato" and "Mutsu" were launched between 1919 and 1920, with a displacement increased to 32,720 tons, equipped with nine 16-inch guns and twenty 5.5-inch guns.

It is generally observed that there are at least five battleships under construction, all with a displacement of more than 40,000 tons and the same number of guns as the "Nagato." Among them, the "Nissin" and "Takasaki" were reportedly launched in November 1939 and April 1940, respectively, and may be incorporated into the fleet within the year.

There are also three or four pocket battleships. Among them, the "Kashino" was launched in January 1940, and the "Yawata" was launched in April of the same year, and they have likely been incorporated into the fleet. The rumored "Kakure" was completed a year earlier. Each ship has a displacement of 11,000 to 15,000 tons and is equipped with six 12-inch guns, making them very powerful.

Japan currently has seven aircraft carriers. The largest, "Akagi" and "Kaga," have a displacement of 26,900 tons each and were completed between 1927 and 1928, and later renovated. Each ship is equipped with ten 8-inch guns and sixteen 4.7-inch guns and can carry 50 to 60 aircraft. Next are the "Hiryu," "Soryu," and "Ryujo," each with a displacement of 10,050 tons, completed between 1937 and 1940. Each ship can carry 30 to 40 aircraft and is equipped with twelve 5-inch guns. The smallest, the "Ryujo" (completed in 1933), has a displacement of 7,100 tons, and the "Hosho" (completed in 1921) has a displacement of 7,470 tons. The former is equipped with the same guns as the "Hiryu" and other ships. The latter is equipped with four 5.5-inch guns. Each carries 20 to 25 aircraft.

There are at least two recently completed aircraft carriers, namely the "Zuiho" and "Shokaku," both launched in 1939, with a displacement of approximately 14,000 to 20,000 tons. They can carry approximately 45 aircraft and are equipped with twelve 5-inch guns.

There are twelve first-class cruisers. Among them, the "Atago," "Maya," "Takao," "Chokai," "Nachi," "Myoko," "Ashigara," and "Haguro" have displacements ranging from 9,850 to 10,000 tons and are equipped with ten 8-inch guns. The "Aoba," "Kako," "Furutaka," and "Kinugasa" each have a displacement of 7,100 tons and are equipped with six 8-inch guns. All ships were launched between 1925 and 1931. Other cruisers such as the "Tone" and "Chikuma" (completed in 1937-38) have a displacement of 8,500 tons and are equipped with twelve 6.1-inch guns. The "Mogami," "Mikuma," "Suzuya," and "Kumano" (completed in 1934-36) have a displacement of 8,500 tons and are equipped with fifteen 6.1-inch guns. The "Abukuma" and "Natori" are fourteen light cruisers (completed in 1919-25) with a displacement of 5,100 to 5,195 tons and are equipped with seven 5.5-inch guns. The "Yubari" (completed in 1923) has a displacement of 2,890 tons and is equipped with six 5.5-inch guns. The "Tenryu" and "Tatsuta" (completed in 1918) are equipped with guns that can only fire 82-pound shells, which are inferior to the 6-inch guns of other countries. Therefore, later warships were equipped with 6.1-inch guns that fired 120-pound shells to increase their strength.

There are at least five newly built cruisers, with displacements of 8,000 to 9,000 tons. Among them, the "Tsugaru" was launched in Yokosuka East Port in June 1940, and the "Hashidate" and "Kakuda" were launched in large numbers in 1939. Each ship is approximately equipped with twelve 6.1-inch guns.

There are more than one hundred destroyers in active service, with displacements ranging from 770 to 2,000 tons. Many more are either under construction or have been completed. The destroyers are named after wind, cloud, snow, and moon, with poetic meanings, such as "Matsukaze," "Tachikaze," "Oboro," "Minegumo," "Shirayuki," "Mochizuki," and "Onibi."

There are at least 60 to 70 submarines. The newest type of submarine has also been built in five units, with a displacement of 2,190 tons, equipped with eight torpedo tubes and one 5.5-inch gun. The smallest old-style submarines have a displacement of only 655 tons and were completed in 1923, but there are only three of them.

Two recently completed coastal defense ships were originally cruiser replacements. Named "Kashima" and "Katori," each has a displacement of 5,800 tons and is equipped with four 5.5-inch guns. The speed is only 18 knots per hour, but they can be used to carry heavy mines. There are six mine layers, with displacements ranging from 1,135 to 9,240 tons. There are thirteen torpedo boats, ranging from 443 to 720 tons.

Eight old-style cruisers (completed in 1899-1902) are equipped and have been classified as coastal defense ships. There are also eleven seaplane transports (eight of which can be used for commercial purposes), thirteen submarine sweepers, eighteen mine sweepers, two coastal defense ships, nine river gunboats, and many auxiliary ships, such as repair ships, supply ships, oil tankers, and transport ships.

Japanese newspapers exaggerate the attack power of the fleet too much, but in fact, the ships' hulls are overloaded. Since the 1920s, the Japanese Navy has been trying to accomplish great things with limited tonnage, which has become an irreversible trend. As a result, the torpedo boat "Tomozuru" capsized when it first went to sea on a cloudy day due to excessive gun weight. After much effort, it was rescued, but many lives were lost. It was also heard that the four "Mogami"-class cruisers were extremely unstable during sea trials and were only incorporated into the fleet after major modifications, which was still unsatisfactory. The later "Chikuma" and "Tone" completely changed their approach, reducing the number of 6.1-inch guns from fifteen to twelve.

As for the number of Japanese naval officers and soldiers, the last count was 10,700, but it has now been expanded considerably.

### Britain Launches Large-Scale Aid China Movement on "July 7th" Incident; "One Bowl of Rice" Fundraiser Dinner on the 17th; Written Appeal to British People to Strengthen Aid

The British China Aid Committee is currently preparing a large-scale commemoration of China's eighth year of resistance and construction for freedom. Starting from the eve of July 7th, a nationwide expansion of China aid propaganda will be held. It has been decided to raise £1,000 from all sectors and remit it to China on "July 7th," and to use this day as the central starting point for a nationwide China aid movement. At that time, hundreds of thousands of propaganda pamphlets titled "Four Years of Resistance and Construction" will be distributed, detailing the special progress made by China in developing its original strength during the war and pointing out China's construction work to promote China aid among the British people.

China Aid Movements Held in Various Places

A fundraising dinner will be held on July 17th to raise funds for the relief of Chinese war victims. Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, will be invited to attend and preside over the event. At the same time, commemorative meetings will be held in various places to make the British people understand that China has assumed its current work in the struggle to liberate the world from the enslavement of the Axis powers.

Broadcasting Chinese-Related Programs

During the expanded China aid propaganda period, the China Aid Committee will jointly publish articles in major newspapers across the UK and London and formulate radio programs related to China, such as Chinese poetry and introductions to the living conditions of the Chinese people, to be broadcast on radio stations in various places.

Appeal for Donations on the Eve of July 7th

On the eve of July 7th (Sunday), churches will appeal to worshipers to donate to aid Chinese refugees. Hundreds of school boards have written China aid essay contests. The China Aid Committee has helped organize an industrial organization to link British aid with the work of the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement.

Open Letter The Chairman of the China Aid Committee, Lord Listowel, published an article in the Manchester Guardian for the "July 7th China Aid Movement," calling on the British people to donate more to China's war effort to strengthen the strength of one of the three pillars of world freedom. Another open letter was also published, stating: "This year, July 7th marks the fifth year of China's war to defend freedom and national survival. We now intend to raise a special donation on July 7th to donate to China. In order to promote the effectiveness of China aid, we must continue to promote propaganda and practical work in the UK. The biggest shortcoming of the Western people is the lack of awareness. When Japan invaded China, China was insufficiently prepared in material terms, and the Western people were also insufficiently aware in terms of thinking and lacked understanding of the importance of Eastern events. How to strengthen genuine aid to China and promote improved policies are the dual responsibilities of the China Aid Committee. In today's turbulent situation, we dare not stop working, because we believe that this work is also preparing a new path for the future of the Chinese and British people. May you help our efforts."

Fundraising Results of All-American Chinese Assistance Federation Inserting Badges

New York News, the All-American Chinese Assistance Federation held street fundraising by inserting badges in New York on May 19, 22, 23, and 3. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. According to the association, the results of this fundraising campaign were excellent. One hundred sixty-seventy Chinese and American women participated, and forty to fifty American socialites and famous "models" also participated. Chinese women participants were all invited by Mrs. Zhao Bufan and worked hard, including the Overseas Chinese Women's New Movement Association, the Women's慰勞慰劳慰劳慰劳Association, male and female students from overseas Chinese schools, and other individuals. After three months of effort, approximately US$2,100 was raised. Mrs. Zhao Bufan's youngest daughter, Miss Jinqing, also received a red paper (cheque) worth US$500 from a wealthy friend to be donated to the association for refugee relief. It is heard that the family members of Mr. Sun Ke and the daughter of Mr. Lin Yutang have also joined, and their spirit is commendable and worthy of emulation.

### Various Industries and Markets Closed for Two Days; Abundant Funds at the End of June; Silver and Money Businesses to Resume Operations on the 3rd

Yesterday was the semi-annual settlement period for the silver and money businesses in the first half of the Republic of China's 30th year. Various banks and firms completed interest payments and rushed to handle the semi-annual settlement. Although business hours were normal to the public, internal hours were extended. As the industrial and commercial sectors also handled semi-annual settlements, the receipts and disbursements were particularly heavy compared to usual. However, after adjustments across the financial sector, funds were exceptionally abundant, and all industries safely passed this end-of-June settlement period.

Extended Exchange and Lowered Discount Rates

The Bills Clearing House of the United Bank Preparatory Committee, in order to facilitate the exchange of bills between peer companies, specifically extended the bill exchange time for the settlement day of the first half of the Republic of China's 30th year to 4:45 PM. The original exchange time was from 3:15 PM, which is a delay of 1 hour and 30 minutes. However, the time for collecting bills remained the same. Members of the Money Industry Association carried out settlements, which were usually at the end of the lunar year, but now, in order to facilitate settlements, they are conducting a regular settlement at the end of June. They have already started to handle this separately. Regarding the money market discount rate, since the influx of Shanghai capital has increased funds, the market discount rate has dropped to 3%. The discount rate for June has been resolved by the association to be 2%.

Various Industries Closed During the Settlement Period

Silver and money businesses will be closed for two days from today and will resume operations on July 3rd. Various industries and markets, such as foreign exchange, gold, securities, yarn and flowers, cotton, tobacco exchange, hardware, beans, rice, and grains, will be closed for two days from July 1st due to end-of-June settlements and will reopen for business on July 3rd. Foreign banks will also be closed for two days according to past practice. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau announced yesterday: "The Bureau will suspend the withdrawal of deposits on July 1st and 2nd as it is a period for settling semi-annual deposit interest." The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will not be closed to the public on these two days but will suspend deposits and withdrawals for two days to handle settlements. Depositors are urged to pay attention.

### Ningbo Cargo Transportation to be Controlled; Similar to the Situation in Various Ports Along the Yangtze River

It is learned that in order to control cargo transportation in the occupied areas, the Japanese side has ordered various business groups to organize trade associations. It is stipulated that if various businesses want to transport goods through Ningbo, they must apply through the trade association. Without a trade association, no accommodation can be made. Therefore, businesses will have many procedures to go through to transport goods in the future, and free transportation is no longer allowed. This situation will be the same as cargo transportation at the ports along the Yangtze River. Although the detailed measures have not yet been specified, it is expected that they will be implemented after the issue of commercial ship resumption is resolved.

### French Police Strictly Punish Rice Weevils; Determined to Fight Against Unscrupulous Merchants; Yong'an Rice Shop Changed Scale Capacity; Ordered to Close and Guards Sent

The French police learned that the owner of Yong'an Rice Shop at No. 60 Xin Yong'an Street had used a file to lower the edges of the scales and other utensils used in the shop, reducing their capacity to exploit the common people and seek exorbitant profits. After verifying the above-mentioned circumstances, the police arrested the shop owner, revoked his license, ordered the shop to close, and sent guards to watch over it.

Cheating Situation

The cheating method was to reduce the original capacity of a five-liter utensil that could hold four kilograms to 3.92 kilograms, a two-jin utensil that could hold 1.6 kilograms to 1.56 kilograms, and a one-liter utensil that could hold 800 grams to 700 grams. The police hope that citizens who are aware of the cheating situation of various rice weevils will report it to the nearest police station.

Warehouse Rice to Arrive Soon

According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the first batch of 27,150 bags of public warehouse small broken rice will arrive on the 4th, loaded on the Gran ship managed by the Norwegian firm Wah Lun Trading Company. The Lykee Trading Company has begun preparations for picking up the goods and storing them in warehouses today. It is heard that the public warehouse small broken rice will be issued to various rice shops for sale only after the first phase of foreign rice imported by the Public Works Department has been sold. The rice will be directly distributed to various rice shops by the Public Works Department and will no longer go through the hands of various miscellaneous grain stores. A senior staff member of the Xiang Mao Foreign Firm stated, "When he was inspecting the sales reports submitted daily by various rice shops selling foreign rice from the Public Works Department, he discovered that the number of sales filled in on the report of a certain rice shop was actually greater than the number purchased. This move is clearly contrary to the sales rules. Although the rice shop claimed that this was because the number of sales suddenly increased and they did not have time to purchase from the authorities, but temporarily transferred the goods from neighboring rice shops, whether this statement is credible or not, the authorities have long ago announced a clear stipulation that 'rice shops must not transfer foreign rice from the Public Works Department to another rice shop.'"

### Celebration of US Independence Day; Shanghai Businessmen Participate; Blessing for President Roosevelt

The fourth of this month marked the 152nd anniversary of the founding of the United States. American expatriates in Shanghai and American authorities in Shanghai felt that celebrating this national holiday was especially necessary at a time when their country was helping democratic nations strive for victory. On that day at noon, the American Consul General, Lockwood, and all the American expatriates, held a social gathering and luncheon at the American Country Club on Great West Road to celebrate together. The American Chamber of Commerce also convened all its members at 12:30 p.m. on the same day to raise a toast to bless the nation. A celebratory ceremony was held at 1:00 p.m. Chinese business leaders, believing that the United States was intensifying its aid to China, and that the two countries shared the responsibility of establishing world peace, felt they should celebrate even more. They attended the celebratory banquet on this day to bless President Roosevelt of the United States.

### Public Notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council; Levying of Autumn Property Tax

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the autumn property tax and the second half of the year's land tax would be levied starting July 1st. The Council will not send staff to collect land tax and property tax for Western-style houses. Landlords and residents, upon receiving the payment notice from the Council, should submit their taxes to the Tax Section at 109 Jiangxi Road for verification and collection. The tax collectors dispatched by the Council will carry identification documents with their photographs attached for identification. Taxpayers must pay attention when paying taxes.

### Slight Improvement in Living Standards After Small-Grain Rice Enters the Market; Shanghai Municipal Council Releases June Cost of Living Report; Purchasing Power of National Currency Increases by Half a Cent Compared to May

The Shanghai Municipal Council released the Shanghai workers' cost of living index and commodity price situation for June of this year, stating that since August of last year, the cost of living index for Chinese workers in Shanghai had only decreased this June. This was due to the entry of small-grain rice into the market, which immediately improved the rice market situation. Sales of small-grain rice far exceeded those of other types of rice. Previously, Saigon rice was used in this index, but small-grain rice was used starting in June. The total index for May was 802.68, and for June it was 772.82, a decrease of 29.86 points, or 3.72%. The purchasing power of the national currency increased from 1 jiao 2 fen 4 li 6 hao in May to 1 jiao 2 fen 9 li 4 hao, an increase of half a cent.

Prices of Food and Clothing Both Decrease Slightly

The food category index saw a significant decrease in June, while the clothing category saw a slight decrease. The fuel and miscellaneous categories increased slightly. The changes in June are shown in the table below:

Category Percentage Increase or Decrease Compared to Last Month

Food Category Decreased by 5.33

Clothing Category Decreased by 0.07

Fuel Category Increased by 0.38

Miscellaneous Category Increased by 0.55

Within the food category, rice prices decreased, and vegetable prices also fell. However, fish and meat products were particularly expensive. Among fuels, firewood prices fell, but coal briquettes still rose. As a result of price changes in various clothing categories, there was a slight decrease, and demand was not strong due to the warmer weather. Among miscellaneous items, writing paper and soap fell in price, but other items continued to rise. The average price of indica rice was 109 yuan 8 jiao 1 fen per dan.

Required Income for Workers' Living Expenses

The following figures represent the actual income of the head of a worker's household and other family members, as well as other income in the household. Actual income refers to wages and all allowances. These figures are based on a study of worker household income distribution and cost of living expenses in June. The table below shows the income required to maintain the first type of life (i.e., living standard A) below that of 1936, and the second type (i.e., living standard B) at a minimum.

Percentage Living Standard A Living Standard B

Income of Head of Household 53.3 86.10 79.86

Income of Other Family Members 34.0 5.92 50.94

Other Income in the Household 12.7 20.52 19.03

Total 100.0 161.536 149.834

Note This index is compiled based on the living standards of workers before the war in 1936. Recently, due to rising costs and declining living standards, the cost increased by 6.16 times in June of this year, based on the degree of reduction.

### Professor Malley Discusses Facts; China Will Surely Achieve Final Victory; Its National Spirit and Strength Far Exceed Those of Other Countries; Japan Is Exhausted and Unable to Support Itself

On the 4th of this month, the American Independence Day, the Shanghai English-language newspaper "The China Press" issued a special "Light of Democracy" edition yesterday to commemorate the occasion. The publication praised the democratic nations of China, Britain, and the United States. One article, titled "Can China Win?", was written by Professor Malley of National Jinling University, who praised China's high national spirit and its spirit of arduous struggle, which far exceeded that of countries such as France and Belgium. He stated that Japan is now exhausted, and if China can unite from top to bottom, persevere to the end, and ensure that foreign aid from the Yunnan-Burma Road is not cut off, then the final victory will undoubtedly belong to China. The full text is translated below:

China's National Spirit Is Very High

"When the air raid sirens sounded, the 500,000 citizens of Chengdu realized that a crisis was coming and quickly evacuated outside the city, lying down under the shady trees for four hours. They then saw Japanese planes appearing over Chengdu, dropping hundreds of bombs in a few seconds. After the bombing was over, they returned to their homes, and although they heard about the tragic situation caused by the air raid, they were not panicked at all, but dealt with it with a steadfast spirit. In less than an hour, the alert was lifted, and they continued their work. This is a glimpse of China after nearly four years of war. China's resistance to aggression has been more persistent and tenacious than that of France, Belgium, etc.

The War Policy Has Achieved Great Results

"To date, it is Japan, not China, that seeks peace, because the latter insists that Japanese troops must withdraw from China before there is room for negotiation. Therefore, the spirit of the Chinese nation is deeply admirable, and the patriotism inherent in its people is beyond our imagination. If China can get sufficient supplies of arms and ammunition, and if the country can unite, it will undoubtedly achieve final victory. China's determination to fight the war has already achieved great results, and dawn is already breaking.

Japan Is Finding It Difficult to Maintain Face

"In fact, it is now Japan, not China, that is retreating. Japan has now withdrawn from the entire province of Guangxi, part of Guangdong, and several places along the Yangtze River, which proves that the strength of the Chinese army has gradually increased. The only weapon that the Japanese side relies on for counterattack is propaganda. Although the Japanese side avoids saying that the withdrawal of Japanese troops is 'voluntary', if the Tokyo side claims that it will send troops to occupy the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Myanmar, and other places, then this kind of statement is nothing more than to maintain 'face'. It can be seen that under the attack of the regular army and guerrillas in China, the Japanese army has had to retreat. Since it has had to retreat, and also wants to preserve 'face', its predicament is obvious. Japan has not been able to occupy the whole of China, nor has it been able to control the whole of China, so it has had to do its best to preserve its 'face'.

Unable to Control the Occupied Areas

"The Japanese side often calls itself 'occupying', but it has not succeeded. For example, on the Jinghu Road, which is under strict Japanese surveillance, trains are derailed by bombs every few days. Also, in a certain city where countless Japanese troops are stationed, Chinese officials can still work as usual and collect taxes, and send them to the Chinese government. This is a glimpse of what the Japanese call an occupied area. At present, the Japanese army must defend both the front and the rear at the same time, just like a boxer who thinks he is invincible and does not need to pay attention to the other party's deep-seated considerations. In fact, the most difficult thing for the Japanese army at present is that it cannot control the guerrillas in the occupied areas. Its troops and weapons, I don't know, before they could even fight, all fell into the hands of the guerrillas.

The Strength of the Chinese Army Is Growing Day by Day

"The strength of the Chinese army is growing day by day. For example, the Chinese army once had the strength to take back the entire province of Shanxi during the winter, but the military authorities did not want to do so, and dismissed the idea, believing that this would contain a strong force on the other side. We know that the Chinese guerrillas in that area are very strong and can destroy the Japanese army and its equipment. The Japanese army cannot obtain supplies in the occupied areas, because the Chinese people refuse to hand them over, and sometimes even burn their agricultural products in advance to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Japanese army. Therefore, the Japanese army has to obtain agricultural supplies from its own country, which is really the least economical.

Japanese Air Raids Are Not Worth the Loss

"In the early stages of the war, the Japanese side needed 25 million yen per day for war expenses. In economic terms, Japan has been losing out in everything. If Chongqing is bombed every day, the duration of the bombing is longer than that of any other city in the world, and there is no place in the world that has suffered as much damage as Chongqing, but the cost to the Japanese side is far greater than the cost to the Chinese side for reconstruction. Chongqing's air-raid shelters are like a public gathering place, because the facilities are safe, and people often talk, laugh, play, and discuss sleeping in the shelters, just like in peacetime. The speed of construction of this project is far faster than that of European countries, and it is still under construction today, such as for the storage of cars, gasoline, and other supplies.

China Has the Factors for Victory

"The Chinese people now deeply believe that the Japanese army will eventually be defeated, which is an undoubted fact, so every person hardly talks about this issue every day. The Chinese people are now constantly engaged in production for their motherland, regardless of hardships, to supply the war, and a part of them are drawn from them to fill the regular army and guerrillas. The key to China's victory in the war is due to their steadfast spirit. They are all very interested in this kind of daily life. Now that the United States has taken strong action against Japan, and China can unite internally, these are all factors that will contribute to China's final victory.

### Travelers to the US Must Obtain Approval from the US State Department; This New Law Will Take Effect Today; Prevent Foreigners from Entering the US to Engage in Illegal Activities

According to foreign sources, the US State Department recently promulgated a new law, which will take effect today, stipulating that foreigners traveling to the United States must first obtain the approval of the US State Department, and then submit the application for approval to the consulate of the country where the applicant is located, and the US consulate will then issue a visa on the passport. Therefore, travelers to the United States from Shanghai or other Far Eastern ports will generally need two or three months to complete this procedure. According to US officials yesterday, the main reason for changing this visa procedure is to strengthen the national defense plan, to prevent foreigners from entering the United States at this time to engage in illegal activities. Therefore, entrants must have a personal resume and must sign an oath not to conspire to undermine the current US government. Students studying in the United States must also prepare the same documents and attach supporting documents to be sent to the US State Department for prior review.

### Verdict on the Assassin of Commander Xie; Commander Lei Issues a Statement; Commander Xie's Usual Focus is on Influencing People with Personality; The Assassin's Confession is Absurd

The four rebel soldiers who assassinated Commander Xie were prosecuted by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and after several trials by the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, were sentenced to death the other day. Commander Lei of the battalion issued a statement yesterday saying that the commander always focuses on influencing people with personality as the first priority. The bizarre behavior and impure thoughts of the four rebel soldiers were long known to the officers and soldiers of the entire battalion, but the commander always held the attitude that sincerity can move mountains and diligently persuaded them, unwilling to send them to court, which would tarnish the past glory of the entire battalion. Unexpectedly, this tragedy occurred. According to Commander Lei, the commander paid the most attention to the nutrition of the soldiers during his lifetime. All comrades in the battalion were sure to be full at every meal. The physique of our soldiers can make this clear. The so-called poor treatment and insufficient food of the rebel soldiers is purely fabricated and not worth refuting. In addition, the commander's finances have always been very open. All income and expenditure accounts are published monthly, and there is also an internal economic committee (composed of ten people elected by all officers and soldiers). The so-called undisclosed external donations of the rebel soldiers are even more absurd and not worth arguing. According to Commander Lei, the rebellious behavior of the four rebel soldiers was obviously premeditated.

Immediately, the cups and plates on the table were blown away. The other diners and employees were all frightened and fled in disarray. After the incident, the Japanese side received the news and quickly dispatched a large number of military police to the scene. They found that one of the two guests had been blown off his left foot and had fainted on the ground. The other guest had disappeared. The injured person was sent to a hospital for treatment.

### Letter

To the Editor, On June 28th of this year, according to Qi Zhaokang, the owner of Run Kangyong Yarn Company, our firm was entrusted with the task of suspending business and liquidation due to the influence of the market, and appointed a representative to handle it. After our lawyers accepted the commission, we immediately went to the company with the clerk to carry out the liquidation as usual, and the company's accountant and executor transferred the existing twenty warehouse receipts for Shuangma cotton yarn, twenty bags, as well as 92.5 yuan in cash, account books, documents, seals, etc. for takeover. At this time, some creditors requested that our lawyers deliver the warehouse receipts to offset debts, which was opposed by our lawyers and other creditors, resulting in a stalemate. Therefore, our lawyers reported the matter to the police and handed over all the above-mentioned items to the police for custody at the same time. This is the fact of the matter. As for whether the owner of the company is fraudulent, it is a question of the outcome of the trial, which is completely separate from the lawyer's acceptance of the liquidation, and when the lawyer accepts the principal's liquidation, it is impossible to suspend judgment on whether he is fraudulent. Now, reading the news published in your newspaper on June 29th of this year, the facts are not entirely consistent. We hereby send a letter, hoping that you will investigate and correct it. Sincerely, Lawyer Qian Shusheng, June 30th.

History of the University

Zhen Dan University was founded in 1903 and has a history of 28 years. It is the only university established by the French Catholic Church in China. It was founded by Mr. Ma Xiangbo, and the initial campus was located at the old site of the Xujiahui Meteorological Observatory. In 1908, it moved to Lujiawan. Subsequently, school buildings were gradually added and managed with meticulous care, resulting in the Zhen Dan University of today. In the winter of the 21st year of the Republic of China, it was approved and registered by the Ministry of Education. Currently, it is divided into three departments: Law, Science, Engineering, and Medicine, and the curriculum is known for its strictness.

### Yanjing University Enrolls Students in Shanghai: Registration Begins Today, Official Examinations Begin on the 10th

Since Yanjing University of Beiping decided to enroll students in Shanghai, many people have been going to the YMCA Vocational Guidance Center to inquire about the application process. It has been learned that the person in charge of Yanjing University's enrollment in Shanghai arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to the person in charge, who spoke to a reporter from Shenjiang News, the current environment at Yanjing University is quite good. Students also have considerable freedom in extracurricular activities. Most of the professors are full-time and rarely hold positions at other schools, so they can focus on teaching. As for the number of students to be admitted, it will not be too many, but the questions will not be very difficult. Therefore, anyone who has graduated from a senior high school that is registered with the Ministry of Education and managed carefully can give it a try. Those who wish to apply can register starting today (the 1st) at 169 Yuanmingyuan Road, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The official examinations are scheduled to begin on July 10. As for the examination location, it may be held at the McTyeire School for Girls on Yidingpan Road. The person in charge also stated that the most important thing in the Yanjing University exam is the intelligence test. The test appears to be very easy on the surface, but it requires a calm mind and quick thinking, otherwise it will be difficult to answer. This is because some questions are very easy, but there is not enough time, or the large number of questions can cause mental confusion. As for Chinese, it focuses on new literature. The essay topics that are decided upon are also mostly new literature topics. In addition, there may also be translation (classical Chinese to vernacular Chinese) and new-style punctuation. The school attaches great importance to English. For essays, attention must be paid to sentence structure, grammar, and thought. If any of the three are lacking, it will be difficult to be selected. In addition, there is a "reading comprehension" test, which requires reading a classical Chinese text within a limited time and answering the questions listed within a specified time. Therefore, close attention must be paid during reading, and answers must be concise and rapid. The school's math exams are different from those of other universities. The materials are often easy, but there are many questions, so it is difficult to answer them all. There are also English questions included from time to time. There is nothing special to mention about the natural science and knowledge tests. In addition, the school's fees are very low. For ordinary students, in addition to tuition of 55 yuan per semester, board is only 80 yuan and lodging is only 20 yuan, so the annual cost will not exceed 500 yuan.

### Shanghai Poor Children's Relief Center for the Unemployed Holds School Affairs Meeting to Discuss Reorganization Plans for the Next Semester

The Shanghai Poor Children's Relief Center for the Unemployed will end the current semester soon, so it convened its third school affairs meeting on June 29 to discuss reorganization plans for the next semester. Chairman Zhang, Director of Academic Affairs Zhu, Inspector Chen, and principals of various voluntary primary and secondary schools, including Li Baiqiang, Tao Yayu, Dai Qirui, Jin Chengyun, Li Guanghua, Wu Yueqiu, and Xue Huijin, attended, totaling over 20 people. Chairman Zhang, as chairman of the meeting, first led everyone in standing up to observe a moment of silence in memory of the late director, Mr. Zhou Jiyun. Then, he reported on the financial situation and academic situation of the current semester, stating: "This center was established for poor children who are unemployed, and the number of poor children is increasing due to environmental pressures. The center's funding comes entirely from donations from enthusiastic people in the community. Since we are serving poor children, we must do our best in our positions to achieve the greatest effect with the least amount of funds. What is the greatest effect? It is hoping that every poor child does not lose the opportunity to attend school. If so, we will not only gain supreme satisfaction in our conscience, but we can also tell the benevolent gentlemen in the community who enthusiastically donate funds that we have no shame. Therefore, each school must meet the specified standard for the issue of filling the number of students in the coming semester. This is what I solemnly propose to report to you. As for the curriculum, it must also be practical and relevant to the application of poor children, so that in the future, poor children can use what they have learned to apply to society and obtain a solution for their livelihood. Therefore, relieving poor children from unemployment is actually relieving poor children from their future livelihoods. Thinking of this, the responsibility is even greater. I hope to encourage everyone." Many important cases were discussed. After the meeting, Chairman Zhang earnestly inquired about any difficulties the schools had and resolved them one by one. It is reported that the schools under the center are scheduled to start school on August 22 for the next semester.

### Xin Jian Middle School Reduces Tuition Fees

Although it is planned to increase tuition fees appropriately starting next semester, the school authorities, in view of the high cost of living in Shanghai, have decided to reduce tuition fees as much as possible in order to reduce the burden on students' parents. The junior high school tuition is 25 yuan, and the senior high school tuition is only 35 yuan. The school is known for its strict teaching and management, so it is expected that there will be a large number of students applying for admission this year. As the school building on Sima Road is not sufficient, a second branch has been opened at 146 Jing'an Temple Road, Hadong Road. The first application date has been set for 8:00 AM on the 12th of this month, to be held simultaneously at the main and branch schools. Those who wish to study at the school can quickly go to the first branch of the school on Sima Road to register.

### Yarn and Cloth: Guangdong Sales Continue to Be Strong, Mixed Yarn Prices Jump Wildly, Double Horse Prices Remain at Original Base, Golden Double Horse Prices Begin to Rise

The yarn market remains firm, due to continuous demand from Hong Kong buyers. There were transactions of several hundred bales of Double Horse factory orders, with total business exceeding 2,000 bales. 23-count Golden Rooster yarn rose by 30 yuan, and there are 215 pieces to be shipped to Hong Kong today and 125 pieces to Siam. Therefore, the foundation of cotton yarn is very solid, and some in the industry remain in a bullish position, due to the increasingly tight factory orders. However, it is said in the market that the shorts have been continuously rolling over their positions, and the amount of margin they have put up is huge. Therefore, it is rumored that if prices continue to rise, the longs will completely corner the market, and there will inevitably be bankruptcies. It is feared that money will not be recovered. Therefore, at the opening yesterday morning, everyone closed out their positions at the original base price. The market once returned to level. Subsequently, it was heard that sales in the Guangdong market were brisk, and the shorts rushed to cover their positions. However, a major player who switched from short to long the previous day came back to sell, offering 6,000 bales, priced from 1,620 yuan to 1,600 yuan. As a result, the market eased, and a tense situation was alleviated. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,625 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,585 yuan. In the afternoon, as July 1st and 2nd were both holidays, there were no transactions.

The spot Double Horse market closed in the morning, and sentiment was relaxed. There were many different opinions. The opening price was 1,605 yuan, but a major player came out to sell, and the price fell to 1,585 yuan in an instant. It fluctuated within the 600 yuan range for a long time. Subsequently, it was heard that the Guangdong buyers were very strong, and spot yarn prices had risen by 20 to 30 yuan. Confidence was immediately boosted, and buying interest was strong. The market gradually rose to 1,625 yuan. However, a major player closed out their profits and sold, and the market eased, closing at 1,600 yuan. It is estimated that the total trading volume for half a day was 11,900 bales, of which 1,900 bales were from Hong Kong buyers and 10,000 bales were speculative transactions.

The market situation for Golden Double Horse futures yarn turned upward, due to activity from buyers and approximately 2,000 bales in Guangdong yarn sales. As a result, confidence was boosted, and the upward trend was quite strong in the afternoon. As a result, the July contract rose by 25 yuan, and the August contract rose sharply by 36 yuan. The exchange's trading has greatly developed, due to the severe short squeeze in the spot market. New spot transactions have come to a standstill, and speculators have flocked to the futures market. The total trading volume for the day was 16,050 bales, an increase of 8,050 bales compared to the previous day. The high, low, and closing prices for the day are as follows:

Starting from July 3, the Double Horse futures yarn market will add September futures yarn, and the quality grades of each yarn will be consistently set lower. The main counts of the same grade are listed as follows:

### Cotton Prices Are High, 3,000 More Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive Continuously

The spot cotton situation remains as firm as ever. Although American cotton has seen a correction, local inventories are decreasing daily, and the supply is unreliable. Therefore, cotton merchants unanimously anticipate a rise in prices, and cotton prices are expected to rise by 4 to 5 yuan.

A large batch of Indian cotton came via Hong Kong. The Jardine Matheson Shipping Company's Yuesheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday (Sunday). In addition to a large batch of foreign rice and flour, there were also 3,000 bales of Indian cotton, which were unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Hoarding Reappears, Eastern Piece Goods Futures Also Rise Sharply

Factory Cloth: The market continued to be firm yesterday, due to the resurgence of hoarding by both industry insiders and outsiders. Transactions were frequent, and asking prices rose sharply. White cloth, coarse cloth, and twill cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Indigo cloth and An An blue cloth rose by about 1 yuan per piece. Drills and dyed cloths from British merchants such as Lundon & Co. and Jardine Matheson also rose by 1 to 1.5 yuan per piece. Over 500 pieces of various cloths were traded on Mu Street. Due to the increased consolidated tax in the coming month, large quantities of factory inventory cloth are being transferred to warehouses. Hong Kong and Guangdong buyers purchased over 200 pieces of blue cloth and dyed twills, while buyers in Rangoon and Singapore purchased over 300 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twills, coarse cloth, and floral cloth.

Eastern Cloth: White fine cloth has seen a sharp increase in prices due to continued purchases by both actual consumers and hoarders. The leading futures contracts on the exchange opened flat for the first two rounds and then rose in a straight line from the third round onwards. As a result, the price rose sharply by 1.7 to 1.8 yuan per piece compared to the Saturday market price. The spot market initially fell and then rose, and transactions were strong. The highest selling price for leading factory warehouse receipts opened at 50 yuan, and closed slightly lower at 49.9 yuan. Dyed cloths, Four Gentlemen serge, rose to 1.6425 yuan in the afternoon. Afterwards, as the banks were closed for the holiday (July 2), retail investors took profits and sold, pushing the price down to close at 1.635 yuan.

Exports: On July 1, there were 12 pieces of piece goods shipped to Amoy, 490 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, and 275 pieces shipped to Siam.

### Grains: Rice Prices Continue to Fall, Over 20,000 More Bags of Hong Kong Rice Arrive

The foreign rice market situation was stable yesterday. Both futures and spot rice saw a continued decline of over 1 yuan. However, the day before yesterday, Sunday, was a half-year closing day, and the market was closed. Local buyers saw an increase in demand, and the market was still active. However, at the opening in the morning, due to the large influx of rice arriving in recent days, and the remaining unsold portion of the public sale rice was more than 100,000 bags, and more Tribute rice and public warehouse rice being transferred to the public sale, confidence was weak. In addition, due to the month-end closing sales, the prices of all grades immediately decreased by 1 to 2 yuan after the market opened. The futures prices for Lu Road rice and Yinghua Si rice were low. The asking price for small-grained spot rice was 148 yuan, Lu Road was 147.5 yuan, futures were 146-147 yuan, and broken rice futures were 113-114 yuan. Subsequently, as spot rice sales increased and purchases rebounded, futures prices for Lu Road and Yinghua Si rice also immediately followed suit, increasing by over 1 yuan. Spot rice prices also immediately rebounded by over 1 yuan after the decline, as shops on this street and the various Zhejiang oil groups in the interior took advantage of the low prices to purchase. Therefore, in the end, the decrease was only a few cents to 1 yuan lower compared to the Saturday price. The total trading volume for the day was 22,000 bags of spot rice, 800 tons of Yinghua Si rice, the opening price of first-grade Saigon spot rice was 127.5 to 124.5 yuan, second-grade was 122 to 120 yuan, broken rice was 97 to 95.5 yuan, third-grade broken rice was 84 yuan, small-grained was 122.5 to 120 yuan, Min Dang was 131 to 126 yuan, Bo rice was 112-113 yuan, red rice was 109 yuan, the arrival of guest sen rice was limited, and Wuhu machine sen rice was only opened at 115 yuan.

A large batch of foreign rice continuously arrived in Shanghai. The Taigu Company's Taiyuan Wheel arrived at port on Saturday evening, transporting 9,998 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Jardine Matheson Shipping Company's Yuesheng Wheel arrived in Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday (Sunday), also transporting 14,976 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf. The foreign rice transported by the two ships was all the Bureau of Public Works' low-priced rice.

Although the supply of thick-grain and thin-grain domestic rice was still limited, as local buyers saw foreign rice declining and weak, their sentiment also slackened. Sales were poor, and the market could not establish a foothold, declining by 1 yuan per shih. The opening price for fresh special early and late rice from Nangan was 137 yuan, and the general market price was 134.5 yuan. Unpackaged old rice from Wuxi fell from a high of 131 yuan to a final price of 126 yuan.

As sales of glutinous rice had fallen, combined with the decline in foreign rice, the market felt even more deserted, and transactions were sparse. Prices followed foreign rice, falling by about 2 yuan. Hong Kong white yuan opened at a high of 120 yuan, ordinary was 118.5 yuan, and the final price was 116 yuan. Glutinous tea was 111 to 104 yuan. Domestic glutinous rice will also be difficult to maintain under these circumstances. The opening prices were 122-123 yuan, medium grade was 120 yuan, and low grade was 118 yuan.

### Flat-Priced Sales to Be Suspended Tomorrow, Flour Market Hovering

Over 36,000 More Bags of American Flour Arrive Continuously

Yesterday's spot foreign flour market situation continued to hover. In terms of supply, the ship "Taiyuan" transported 33,850 bags of American flour from Hong Kong, mostly Five Swallow brand flour. The goods are being unloaded. Also, the Jardine Matheson Shipping Company's Yuesheng Wheel transported 2,442 bags of flour from Hong Kong, which were also unloaded yesterday. As the bottom of the month was near, rice prices were declining, and confidence was weak. However, as the Huachang flat-priced flour had exhausted its raw materials, it was decided to suspend sales starting on July 2, so the sales on this street were not lonely. The general market price opened at 32.1 yuan for Golden Dragon flour, 32.9 yuan for Battery flour, and 32.8 yuan for Steamship brand. Transactions totaled over 1 yuan per shih. The market situation has not yet escaped the brewing phase. The supply and demand of wheat were both quiet, and there was no regular market.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil and Soybeans Have Different Strengths and Weaknesses

Cooking Oil: Has recently turned weaker, because actual sales are slow and not smooth. Hoarders are all intending to sell, fearing that more oil will come to Shanghai. The market trend is not likely to improve. Yesterday, 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were sold at a price of 174 yuan. 300 cans of Jiangbei local raw oil were priced at 158 yuan. July delivery of Da You factory clear oil was 116 yuan, and late July delivery was 117 yuan, all showing a decline compared to the previous period.

Soybeans: Have slightly turned for the better. The attitude of cargo owners has gradually changed from selling to holding, so the situation has slightly strengthened. Yesterday, 150 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were purchased from this street at a price of 47.5 yuan. 100 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans were priced at 44 yuan. 200 bags of Qingdao soybeans were priced at 43.8 yuan. 35 corner of Guide soybeans 42 yuan.

Exports: 100 bags of soybeans were shipped to Amoy, and 130 bags of soybeans, 7,310 pieces of soybean cakes, 130 bags of sesame seeds, and 50 cans of sesame oil were all shipped to Hong Kong.

### Banks Prepare for Semi-Annual Closing, Exchange Market Quiet

The foreign exchange market situation yesterday was flat, and all exchange rates listed by HSBC were flat. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates was quite stable, and transactions were very rare, as Chinese and foreign banks are having a two-day holiday starting today for the first half of the year. The market is quiet as banks are winding up their accounts at the end of the first half of the year before the holiday. Only Chinese speculators are still offering August short positions, but Chinese banks are buying little, so the market situation has changed little. In the afternoon, no opening prices were heard and the prices remained fixed. In the end, only British exchange rates were slightly tighter, and American exchange rates were flat.

Speculative Offering of August American Dollars

Since the morning's overseas telegraphic news showed a slight increase in Indian silver in the silver market, the exchange rates for British and American exchange rates were unchanged, and the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the British pound fell by 0.025, while the rest remained unchanged. The centrally listed exchange rates remained flat. The early opening selling prices for banks in the domestic market were 3 pence 3125 for spot British exchange and 5.40625 yuan for American exchange.

### Before Year-End Closing and Holiday: Gold Market Stable, June Contracts Fully Settled

Yesterday, the gold market saw fluctuating prices in off-hours trading but trended towards stability. Prices hovered around 6,400 yuan. After initial declines, there was a rebound, which instilled confidence among investors and led to reduced trading volume. This was due to the upcoming bank year-end closing and holiday for the first half of the year, which would necessitate a two-day market closure. The morning's opening saw the securities firms and retail investors selling, causing prices to drop to a low of 6,389 yuan. Unexpectedly, Shanghai West banks and remittance houses started buying, with Li Tai actively purchasing. Prices gradually rose to 6,415 yuan by noon. News of an American ship being sunk by the Germans curbed the rise, causing a slight decline. In the afternoon, prices fluctuated around 6,405 yuan, with only a 10-yuan difference, eventually closing up 5 yuan. The total trading volume was light, at 20,000 taels. Closing prices were stable. The remaining 1,605 contracts for June settlement were finalized yesterday at the month's end, using the HSBC small counter's exchange rate of 5.375 for US dollars, resulting in a price of 6,479 yuan and 1 jiao. Both long and short positions were fully settled. Spot prices were stable, with extremely limited trading. Ming Feng sold 30 taels to Tian Yuan at a price 320 yuan higher than the futures price. There were no reported trades in the afternoon, with prices remaining 320 yuan higher, several yuan higher than last Saturday. Prices for ornamental gold remained stable.

Futures Up Only Five Yuan

Yi Da and Da Feng sold off, gradually dropping the price to 6,389 yuan. Shanghai West banks started buying, causing an immediate rise.

Prices were constantly pushed up, reaching a noon close of 6,409 yuan, 5 yuan higher than last Saturday's noon close. Using the July US dollar exchange rate of 5.40625, the settlement price was 6,442 yuan, a difference of 33 yuan, with a spread of 26 yuan. The selling price of gold from cash shops was 330 yuan higher than the off-hours futures price, while the buying price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There were no bids or offers for spot gold.

Ornamental Gold Exchange Rate Unchanged

The exchange rate for gold jewelry at major silver shops like Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang remained at 695 yuan per tael (buying price reduced by 40 yuan).

### Slight Fluctuations in US Dollar

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw stable off-hours prices. There was little fluctuation in British gold pounds or American gold pounds. British gold notes remained steady, with stable market prices. American gold notes opened at 39 cents, then dropped to 37 cents due to selling by Zhi Cheng. Subsequently, due to purchases by Da Gong and Sen Ji, the price rose to 41 cents, closing at 40 cents at noon. In the afternoon, the price rose further to 43 cents at closing, a rise of 7 cents compared to last week. Spot prices were still 27-28 cents lower than futures prices. Hong Kong notes showed a steady trend, with stable market prices. Japanese gold notes showed a slight upward trend, rising to 1.865 yuan in the evening.

### Securities: Banks Closing Accounts, Public Bonds Only Traded Once, Holidays Today and Tomorrow, Stock Market for Various Industries Quite Active

Due to banks' semi-annual settlements and the holiday today and tomorrow, the public bond market also closed yesterday. Only one transaction was made yesterday. Starting July 3rd, the opening and closing times for the public bond market will be revised to 9:30 AM opening and 10:15 AM closing in the morning, and 2:00 PM opening and 2:30 PM closing in the afternoon. This is due to the hot weather, and the meeting times are temporarily shortened. At the initial market opening yesterday, prices rose slightly due to small purchases by Xin Fu and Lian Yi. Later, due to selling by Yong Chang, De Chang, and Hong Da, Class C bonds, which had just broken through 3 yuan, failed to stabilize and broke through the 3 yuan mark again. During this period of shifting positions, prices could not rise. However, Class A bonds became increasingly disadvantaged, with the difference between them and Class C bonds being only 7 yuan and 4.5 jiao, and the difference widened further. Because there are still 40 days until the lottery draw, short sellers will realize their difficulties and retreat by mid-July. As a result, market prices, except for Class A bonds which were slightly better by 5 fen, were down by 1.5 to 2 jiao. Class C bonds were unchanged. The turnover was 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below:

Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
Unified A | 80.50 | 80.30 | 80.35 | Up 0.50
Unified B | 74.35 | 74.00 | 74.35 | Down 0.15
Unified C | 73.30 | 71.85 | 70.90 | Flat
Unified D | -- | -- | -- | --
Unified E | 70.90 | 70.70 | 70.75 | Down 0.20

Stock trading: 50 shares of Sincere Company were traded at a price of 10 yuan and 1 jiao.

The stock market for various industries was active throughout the day, with prices rising steadily. Rubber stocks showed a particularly strong trend, likely due to the recent announcement of dividends by various companies, which gave people a good impression.

### Sugar Market: Both Red and White Sugar Rise

Yesterday's sugar market continued to tighten, with both red and white sugar seeing improvement. According to Dutch telegrams, August-shipment CIF prices were US$3.75 for Dutch coarse white sugar and US$3.13 for Dutch red sugar. The association's prices for current goods showed 24 coarse white, June new crop, initially at 90 yuan and 6 jiao, then rising to 8 jiao, and further to 1 yuan, up 6 jiao; May imports at 90 yuan, up 7 jiao; April imports at 89 yuan, up 7 jiao; March imports at 88.5 yuan, up 5 jiao.

### Dried Goods: Assorted Red Dates from Hangzhou Sell Extremely Well

Assorted red dates have been out of stock for a long time. It is found that the stock in the market of long red dates and Fu red dates totals about 3,000 packages. Recently, because Hangzhou people went in to purchase in large quantities, almost everything was bought empty, so that the existing stock was exhausted and the price accordingly became tight. For example, Jinan Fu red dates initially sold for 46 yuan, but in less than three days, the price has risen to 52 yuan. Long red dates have also been called up from 30 yuan to 38 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Honeysuckle Firm

The price of honeysuckle at the producing area is not loose, and the foreign exchange rate is high, making it extremely difficult to meet the cost, resulting in the lack of follow-up shipments, so the market in Shanghai is very firm. Yesterday, the market price was 500 yuan for the higher grade and 490 yuan for the next, and it is not easy to loosen.

### Sea-Ear Shells Relax

Sea-ear shells, that is, abalone shells, have arrived recently in larger quantities, and the de-inventory is sluggish, so the price is loose. It is found that the market price once opened at more than 200 yuan, but now the market price is only about 190 yuan, and the trend is flat and soft.

### Coal: Coal Merchants Act Perversely, White Coal Still Rising in Price

After the new goods of Tung Tak Lee white coal arrived at the port last week, the market should have been stable, but the merchants intentionally closed the market and split the price high. In fact, in the hot summer weather, the sales are very slack. Yesterday, the price of No. 123 lump from the car station was 440 yuan per ton, which was 20 yuan higher than the beginning of the month. It is unexpected to act perversely.

### Woolen Fabric: Recent Situation of Woolen Fabric Industry

European War Expansion…Supply Interrupted

Shanghai Factory Weaving…Raw Material Expensive and Scarce

Autumn and Winter Clothing…Great Need to Scour

The arrival of woolen fabrics has been extremely difficult recently, because the European war has spread and expanded, the Mediterranean Sea is dangerous, and the number of ships sailing has been reduced by two-thirds compared with before, and many ships have to take long detours, so those who occasionally arrive are often delayed. Looking at the recent situation, the only port for imported woolen fabrics is Shanghai, which is transferred from Hong Kong. 70% of the goods are British goods, and 25% are Japanese goods. Japanese goods will be difficult to transport to Shanghai in the future, and although British goods have settled down, there is no obstacle. It is impossible to judge in advance. As for the production of woolen fabrics in Shanghai factories, the recent natural raw materials are also subject to high prices and difficult sources, and the output has been reduced a lot. In the future, not only will their own spinning businesses have difficulties, but also foreign companies with strong capital such as Jardine Matheson, Wing On, Hong Kong and Shanghai plants will have difficulties. At that time, small factories will have to be forced to suspend operations.

Recently, since the start of the war between Germany and the Soviet Union, and the tension between the United States and Japan, the local woolen fabric industry has become firm again, because it is said that the arrival of goods will be even more difficult, and the output of local goods will inevitably be scarce. In the future, the supply of various woolen fabrics will tend to be insufficient, so there is a great need to scour for autumn and winter goods. Yesterday, there were transactions for whatever single-sided flannel, suit flannel robe material flannel, serge Walter flannel, overcoat flannel women's color flannel, camel period brocade riding pants flannel, etc.

### Miscellaneous: Floating Stock Disgorged, Soap Sales Mediocre

The soap market is trending toward calm. Because real sales have been slack for several days, speculation is on the sidelines, and hoarders' buying has slightly relaxed, so floating stocks have gradually been disgorged. It is estimated that each box of Gu Ben soap is 54 yuan, each box of Bai Mao soap is 43 yuan, and each box of Huang Xiang Mao soap is 42.5 yuan, and there is no honor or disgrace compared with the previous.

### Eliminating Racial Prejudice

— Wu Dai

One of the greatest sins of mankind is narrow-mindedness and deep-rooted racial prejudice. Historically, countless cruel acts have occurred due to the selfishness and intolerance of different races.

These kinds of unreasonable atrocities continue to emerge in totalitarian countries, but in other parts of the world, they are gradually changing. This shows that mankind is truly progressing, most obviously in the United States.

Black people in the United States were originally looked down upon by white people, but two recent facts are enough to show the gradual improvement of the status of black people. The city of Philadelphia in the United States awards a prize of 10,000 yuan every year to the citizen who has made the most contributions to social progress in a year. This year, the prize was awarded to the famous black female singer Anderson. This move has aroused praise from all parties. Not long ago, President Roosevelt instructed the industry to accommodate qualified workers as much as possible, and not to discriminate because of race, original nationality, religion, or skin color. He believed that continuing to discriminate against certain workers was tantamount to promoting the policies of totalitarian countries.

Racial prejudice cannot be completely eliminated overnight, but the awakening of some people in any country is a commendable and gratifying phenomenon.

A better world should be like a harmonious family, where everyone's status is determined by their beliefs and contributions to social progress, and has nothing to do with race, nationality, religion, or skin color.

Animals

### Animal Air Defense

— Wu Futong

Animals in Britain also have air defense organizations, which are generally planned according to the people's air defense organizations. Britain has a total of 100 million heads of livestock, which is equal to twice the population. The National Animal Air Defense Committee has now completed a plan, including rescue teams, inspection teams (inspecting whether there are animals locked inside when entering bombed areas), stretcher teams, mobile first-aid medical teams, and a temporary rest center.

The work of caring for animals in the emergency center is mostly done by women. A large number of volunteer animal guards have now been recruited to serve as liaisons between the central districts and animal owners. On each street, the committee appoints an animal guard as much as possible. They do not have to work during the bombing. Once the alarm is lifted, they must immediately look for animals in need of rescue everywhere.

The committee has established a registration system for beloved animals. Each animal has a numbered round tag. Through this method, thousands of animals are often returned to their original owners after the bombing. Colonel Stuart, the organizer of the committee, said: "We have found new homes for 1,000 dogs and 600 cats." Because this plan can enable lost animals to return home, it is also respected by the police. In fact, the six million dogs and cats in Britain are nothing more than a national inspection. Colonel Stuart said that dogs, horses, rabbits, monkeys, and birds have almost no fear of bombs.

Because of the lack of gasoline, there are more horses on the streets of various cities than in previous years. Horse owners are also busy strengthening the defense of garages to serve as temporary animal shelters. Parks, baseball fields, football fields, and other open spaces are equipped with emergency tie-up places for horses. During daylight air raids, horses can be tied to trees or manger iron rings to ensure safety. According to British law, horses have reins, so in the event of an alarm, the horses can be tied up quickly. Except for dogs that guide the blind, cats and dogs are not allowed to enter public air-raid shelters. In some parks in London, they have special equipment. Kensington Park has dog air-raid shelters. Each dog is tied to a grid with a chain, and there is a concrete building to cover it. Hyde Park has iron fences around public air-raid shelters, allowing animals to stay there while their owners are hiding underground.

British farmers are also assisted by the state to protect the 37.5 million heads of livestock and 56 million heads of poultry across the country. This work is carried out by the Ministry of Food and the National Farmers' Association. Mobile veterinary teams and local animal management teams are directed by a manager in a parish. A letter from northern England recently said: "During the bombing and machine gun strafing, animals can easily be driven into safe areas without any deaths or injuries."

During the air raids, several dogs have provided extremely valuable services, and Chim is one of the outstanding ones. He is a 12-year-old dog owned by the Stott couple in Pulborough County, Surrey. When Mrs. Fallon's house collapsed and was buried in the defensive trench, Chim was nearby. He tried his best to dig a hole with his paws, which was the size of Mrs. Fallon's body. He also used his mouth to hold Mrs. Fallon's clothes and helped her climb out of the hole. Like a group of chivalrous heroes, he turned around and left without leaving his name after the person was rescued. He was later traced to Walter Leaf Road in Pulborough before he was found. The Dumb Friends League praised his courage and presented him with a special gold medal.

10 The Heart of a Loving Father

So Qiu Haitang and his daughter moved to Hengshui County, which is close to Shandong Province.

"Dad, we live very well in Dao'er, why do we have to move to a strange place?" Mei Shi was really reluctant to leave Li's Village, and she asked her father with a very unhappy look on the day she got up.

"Child, let me tell you," Qiu Haitang put her on his lap and said in a very low voice, "Last month, Uncle came home and told me that we have an enemy coming here, so...! Your dad wants to avoid him before he comes."

"Is the enemy a man or a woman?" Mei Bao asked as if she understood.

"It's a woman...! No, it's a man!" Qiu Haitang replied vaguely. But Mei Bao's sharp eyes had already seen two lines of tears hanging down his face.

"Then let's move away quickly!" She kept nodding her little head and said. She couldn't help thinking that her father was so afraid of this enemy that he would cry, so he must be a very powerful enemy who would even eat people!

In fact, what enemies did Qiu Haitang still have? He was afraid that Luo Xiangqi would find him.

"...The bank matter is really impossible. Although the villain has been running day and night, the gate is tightly closed, and it is hateful that no one can be seen. Master Yuan San died in battle in Rehe last week, and Master Qi is also missing, I am afraid he is dead. The Yuan family here is scattered and there is no one to ask for..."

Although the wording of the person who wrote the letter was not fluent and the sentences were really difficult to understand, the general meaning was not difficult to understand.

He knew that Yuan Baofan never brought his family to Chengde. Since Zhao Si said "The Yuan family is scattered," probably all the wives and concubines must have escaped; he was of course very comforted that Xiangqi could regain his freedom, and he had never hoped to reunite with her, but when he thought of his own ugly face and the economic panic caused by the collapse of the bank, his heart was colder than below freezing point.

Military Affairs

### Radio-Controlled Steamboat

— Li Yi

The United States Navy recently invented a radio-controlled steamboat as a target for bombers to practice bombing. The steamboat is 34 feet long and travels 35 miles per hour. There is no need for a driver in the boat. It is controlled by radio in the bomber, so no lives are harmed during bombing practice. In addition, the steamboat is also unsinkable.

When war breaks out in the future, this radio-controlled steamboat may be filled with explosives and sped to the enemy's warship location to replace torpedoes. Because it is radio-controlled, the accuracy is of course more reliable than torpedoes.

### Children's Concert

— Wei Ren

Recently, there will be a very grand children's concert to be performed on the stage of the Joint Stage. In order to understand the content of this conference, the reporter inquired about news from all parties concerned, and the details are recorded as follows:

The Children's Drama Education Society is hosting the children's concert. They have already performed once on the Joint Stage on March 21 this year, and the results were very good. Thousands of children from all over the city actively participated, and they received enthusiastic support from people from all walks of life. This is the second performance.

The performance date is July 3, starting at 9 o'clock in the morning. The ticket prices are divided into two types, one yuan and six jiao. They are sold to various elementary schools in the city. It is said that the income will be used entirely as a fund to create a "Children's Music Hall" in addition to the necessary expenses.

The performance programs include: "The Tempest", "The Call of the Earth", "Defend Great China", "New China March", "No Passing", etc. These are all very meaningful songs of righteousness. There are also the piano performance of the Weifeng Music Hall and the wind music performance of the China Relief Women and Children Association Children's Music Team. The last wonderful program is: a chorus of five hundred children, singing "Let's Sing" and "Our Song".

Now is the beginning of the summer vacation, and their performances will definitely not hinder the children's homework.

We are very willing to let innocent children sing the songs they love to sing, and we are also very willing to let wise parents who have the mission of education listen to the righteous songs of the children.

### Yan Shishan's Thirteenth Sister

— Lu Yuan Scholar

Yu Yuqin was the first to perform the play "Thirteenth Sister". The successors, male and female, are too numerous to mention. Among those who are more famous, there were Wang Yaoqing in the past and Xun Huisheng in the future. However, they were self-righteous, changed the old rules, and changed the hard qiao to small boots. Their tricks to hide their clumsiness were secretly disapproved by the knowledgeable. The ancients once discussed it. When Yuqin performed this play in those years, she was especially known for her qiao skills. In the original text of the Children's Heroes Biography Yuelaidian, it is said: "The young master (referring to An Ji) quickly retreated two steps, turned around, and wanted to enter the room, but he couldn't help but look back and saw that he was wearing a Yuanqing crepe veil headscarf, two corners, hanging on the side of his ears, two corners covering the swallowtail on the back of his head, wearing a Buddhist blue coarse cloth shirt that was long enough to cover his feet, and the sleeves of a letter were not rolled up, covering his hands, (according to this, the Thirteenth Sister that is performed now, who always wears a red hood and wears red shirt and pants, is inappropriate, but it can only be used in the Nengren Temple) wearing a pair of Erlan pointed toe embroidered broken flower bow shoes under his feet, the size of which is only two inches, less than three inches." It is even more believable that what I said is not wrong, and this is a footnote to the iron plate of qiao stepping in this play. The reason is that Yaoqing is completely unable to perform qiao skills, Huisheng can perform but is not proficient. It is called improvement, but in fact it is simplifying and cutting corners. Today, Shishan is far behind his predecessors, and he is still the same as before, striving to correct Wang Xun, and not following the same path. He can maintain the model of the first righteous in one out of ten thousand. Although it is his debut work, (it is the first performance of Nengren Temple) the singing, speaking, acting, expressions, and body movements are not yet seamless, and everything is in order. However, the scale has been established and the foundation has been laid. Therefore, in the future, with his unique qiao skills, he will be able to improve day by day and dominate the singing world. I express my opinions in the right, because I am happy that he can work hard and strive to be upstream. I will write another poem to give him.

He has inherited Yuqin's old style from afar. He is different from others when he takes the stage. Xun's different schools are difficult to be trained. It is admirable to learn from others and be a hero of the world.

### Strolling Through the Arts Scene

— Yuan

The China Experimental Drama Troupe held a symposium on the evening of the 29th at Xia Guang Middle School. In addition to core members of the troupe such as Zhou Yifeng and Chu Qun, film and drama personalities such as Bai Yun, You Guangzhao, Hua Sha, and Chang Yandao also attended, totaling over thirty people. Bai Yun delivered a speech during the meeting: "I hope drama practitioners stand firm in their positions, recognize their goals, and further hope that the drama troupe belongs to the public, and is not a private property." His words were full of encouragement. It is said that the troupe is currently rushing to rehearse "Regeneration Fate."

The performance of "Fengbo Pavilion" by Hua Sheng was banned because the script failed to pass. The reason was that the content was quite passionate and stirring. According to Shu Shi, the estimated loss this time is around ten thousand yuan. After suffering this blow, Hua Sheng will certainly make persistent efforts and strive forward.

The Huaxia Amateur Drama Society, organized by Shanghai university and middle school students, is scheduled to stage Cao Yu's famous work "Thunderstorm" on July 16th. The play is directed by Zhou Chu. Huang He, who played Yue Fei in "Fengbo Pavilion," and Lü Yukun, among others, are also said to be joining as guest actors.

Wei Ruhui is writing "The Legend of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl" for the Shanghai Drama Society, which will be completed in the coming days.

Tianfeng is rehearsing "Grievances in the Qing Palace." To ensure authenticity, they have specially invited someone familiar with Qing court anecdotes to provide on-site guidance. The production cost of this play is substantial, with costumes and props being designed and newly made. Every member is giving their all.

For the popular performances of "Song of Righteousness," all seats are priced at fifty cents. However, attendance is limited to young students, who must present their school badges to enter.

Last year, the Shanghai Drama Society's summer performances were a "Week of Re-staged Famous Plays." This year it has been designated as a "Comedy Festival." The first program is "Gilding" and "The Proposal," the second program is "God, Ghost, and Man," written by Huang Zongjiang, the third program is "Border Town Story," and the fourth program is "Isolated Island Men and Women," written by Gu Zhongyi. "Wu Ren, a collaborator from "Ren Zhi Chu," will be invited to direct this play.

Chapter 11: Heroic Demeanor Comes to Fierce Battle

Xu Jing also felt that the isolated city was in danger. Wang Yongtai had already sacrificed himself for the country. He and General Zhou did not know what would happen and could only resign themselves to fate. He also thought of Liu Yinying on Weifeng Mountain. This person was a chivalrous youth with much better skills than himself. That day, he playfully took the treasured sword at Wang Yongtai's house, captured the assassin alive, and displayed his skills with ease, earning people's admiration. Although their acquaintance was short, they were new companions, but in their conversations, he knew that he also had a strong patriotic enthusiasm. He had already agreed to go out with him to follow General Zhou to kill the bandits and had also promised General Zhou in person, so he should definitely come. However, when General Zhou's letter arrived, he suddenly made excuses that he had not obtained his aunt's permission and told him to come first. Now that the roving bandits had been attacking the city for many days, he would definitely know, so why was he so late in coming? Yesterday, General Zhou also asked him about it, hoping that he would come to help in the battle. If he does not arrive at this moment, I am afraid he will eventually be disappointed. Then knowing a person's face but not their heart, this person is just outwardly handsome but without righteousness, and is not as straightforward as Zhang Cangqiu and Li Xin. Moreover, his background is also evasive and he refuses to speak directly, which is really unpredictable and cannot be doubted. As Xu Jing thought this, the roving bandits under the city were attacking urgently, and more than a dozen people had climbed up the city wall from the cloud ladders. Xu Jing quickly ran over, holding a gun in his right hand and waving a sword in his left, and beheaded five or six of them. The remaining crowds fled down the city wall. Xu Jing also ordered the soldiers to release more rolling stones, smashing all the cloud ladders one by one. After a period of chaos, things returned to normal. The western gate was attacked with extreme intensity, and General Zhou Yuji defended it with all his might, preventing the roving bandits from entering. At night, they quickly repaired the damaged parts of the city wall. This stalemate continued for seven or eight days, with roving bandits attacking the southwest gates every day. The eastern gate was also sometimes attacked by bandits, and Zhou Yuji ordered Fan Cheng to take care of it carefully. Only the north gate had never been attacked. The terrain there was steep and mountainous, and it was feared that the roving bandits did not attack because it was more difficult to use troops. Therefore, Zhou Yuji relaxed the defense of this route and focused all his efforts on the southwest gates. Unexpectedly, one night at midnight, Xu Jing was patrolling the south gate when he suddenly heard a thunderous roar from the north gate. Several feet of the north gate's city wall suddenly collapsed, and a large group of roving bandits had stormed into the city from outside the north gate (103)—End of Chapter Eleven
