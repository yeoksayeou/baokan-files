(8th United Press dispatch)

Hanoi: Vietnamese Governor-General Vice Admiral Decoux recently delivered a speech in the Consultative Council, making a statement on the details of the border conflict. The wording was extremely firm, stating roughly: We have already adopted a policy of "striking back at those who strike us," and we will respond to any provocative actions. We will not hesitate to use force to retaliate when necessary. If neighboring countries still do not know how to restrain themselves, then we will have no choice but to intensify our resistance. Our air force has always been in the lead, which is commendable. The courageous resistance of the French troops and Vietnamese indigenous troops is particularly determined. I would like to take this opportunity to thank these brave men who defend the border. After the Thai and Vietnamese sides signed a non-aggression treaty on June 12th last year, the Thai government, without any justification, has delayed its implementation. It has even repeatedly made unreasonable territorial demands. When these demands were not met, it brazenly took various aggressive actions in a systematic manner. Our country has refused these demands. As for these aggressive actions, after verifying that they were not due to misunderstandings or unauthorized actions by the country's border defense forces, we resolutely retaliated. However, although the Vietnamese government is determined to safeguard its own rights and territorial integrity "to the end," its desire remains to coexist peacefully with all its neighbors. We are neither weak, nor internally divided, nor discouraged. This has already been clearly demonstrated to the Thai government. If it can fulfill its treaty obligations and express its willingness to establish normal relations with us, then we are ready to accept it at any time. (7th Havas dispatch)

### Soviet Union Discovers Large Number of Oil Wells

Moscow: Mr. Silsky, a member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, recently wrote in Pravda, "After six years of work, geologists have discovered oil wells in Ukraine with a daily output of 100 tons. Investigations have found that there are oil reserves from Poltava to Akhtyrka westward. From this, it can be seen that there are many oil wells hidden in central Ukraine. At the same time, scientists have confirmed that there are oil wells on the north and south banks of the Sea of Azov. In other words, the existence of oil wells in western Ukraine has become a reality. In short, the oil reserves in western Ukraine, Bukovina, and Ukraine are greater than those of the Second Baku and will be able to meet the needs of the entire Soviet Union in two or three years."

Editorial

### A New Era in American Domestic and Foreign Policy

A week ago, President Roosevelt concluded 1940 with a sharp and insightful fireside chat. Then, just yesterday, he embellished the beginning of 1941 with a grand and unprecedented State of the Union address. Dispatches spread the news, and the masses were greatly encouraged. This, along with the simultaneous news of the British army capturing the important North African town of Bardia, made this New Year season exceptionally extraordinary, filled with a new atmosphere and hope, deeply impressing upon people the undeniable truth that history will not regress and humanity will not be destroyed.

Today's world has reached the final decisive moment between aggression and justice, destruction and peace. As President Roosevelt pointed out: the peace of 1918 was certainly not fair, but if those advocating the so-called "new order" truly get their way, using force to re-divide the world, the result would at most be to create more darkness and evil, and to bury endless disasters for future generations. Force and aggression cannot change history; only reason and justice are the guiding lights in the process of human evolution. However, when everything is inevitably threatened by violence, reason and justice must also be armed to prevent the spread of darkness and evil. The failure of President Wilson's lofty ideals at the Paris Peace Conference was due to neglecting the power of reality too much, and his failure simultaneously promoted the rise of American isolationism. But isolation did not bring glory to the United States, nor did it exchange it for security. Instead, it objectively contributed to the execution of some international evils, and to the difficult situation of the United States. Today, Roosevelt's great ambition is actually an expansion and extension of Wilson's lofty ideals: but while the world of 1918 could temporarily obtain a moment of peace, the crisis of 1941 will never allow any remote corners to be at ease. The vast majority of people in the world are disgusted with war, but war is forcing its way to everyone, so that those who are disgusted with war cannot but defend themselves with war in the end. The views and propositions put forward by President Roosevelt in his recent two speeches should naturally be admired by the whole world. And the hard work he has put in to overcome various fallacies and inertia is even more worthy of people's sympathy.

As of the time of writing, the full reaction of all parts of the world to this address is still unknown, and it is even more impossible to guess what the aggressive countries, which have been severely condemned by Roosevelt, are thinking when they see that the US government is determined to support the democratic countries resisting aggression. While pretending to be calm on the surface, I am afraid it will be difficult for them to completely hide their resentment. Perhaps they are still blaming fate and envying the fate of ancient tyrants and aggressors, and uttering words such as "the East Asian New Order and the European New Order have nothing to do with the Western Hemisphere," aren't they clearly hating the United States for being so meddlesome and interfering with their pursuit of their "natural desires"? Helplessly, human civilization has already evolved to the electric age, and is naturally no longer suitable for the existence of figures like the Nile emperor or Caesar Alexander and their attempts. Moreover, since the distance between continents has been greatly shortened by modern transportation tools, the destinies of each other are as responsive as the copper mountains and Luo bells, and can no longer be divided into clear boundaries. From this, it can also be seen that forcibly dividing the continents into "new order" divisions outside of the global unit is tantamount to the foolishness of going against the times, and those who regard the oceans and even national borders as insurmountable moats for aggressors are equally foolish.

If the fate of the world should be decided by the opinion of the vast majority of mankind, then if President Roosevelt's proposal were submitted to a global referendum, the results of heartfelt support would probably be above 99 percent. And those who are creating this tumultuous change today are actually only a very small group among mankind, although they possess some people who can be driven and sharp weapons for carrying out destruction. The main reason why they can be so rampant is still because those who are subjected to aggression are fighting alone, while those who are not affected are watching with their arms folded. This phenomenon has not been completely broken even recently, which is the main reason why the poisonous flames of aggression cannot be extinguished for a while. Today, the United States possesses the richest resources and the strongest strength in the world. It is a great regret that it has not been able to use this advantage earlier to make its political ambitions come true. Now, President Roosevelt has resolutely regarded China and Britain as the defense of the United States, and the United States as the arsenal of democratic countries, and has requested Congress to increase new funds and grant new powers, so as to supply the countries fighting against aggressors with an increasing number of ships, airplanes, tanks, and artillery, neither retreating because these countries cannot afford to pay, nor being shaken by the threats launched by dictators. This is a new era in American domestic and foreign policy, and also a new era in the evolution of the international situation in the past ten years.

Although Roosevelt still said that he would not allow the war to extend to the Western Hemisphere, he did indeed express, as American officials had said before: that he regarded supporting China and Britain as more important than avoiding war for the United States. And he clearly said: "If a dictator is prepared to fight against us, it does not wait for us to have an act of war." This sentence expressed the determination of the United States, and also punctured the usual trick of the aggressors' false intimidation. The aggressive countries are certainly very unhappy with this new step of the United States, but it is expected that they will ultimately be unable to obstruct the implementation of American national policy, nor will they be able to deal with the increasingly strengthened strength of the anti-aggressors. Although Japan possesses a navy that still occupies a considerable advantage at present, in terms of fighting against the United States, resources, strength, determination, and even morale are all major problems. Only those theorists who are purely dominated by a false sense of superiority dare to assert that Japanese-Italian cooperation can defeat the United States. In fact, after invading China with all its strength for three and a half years, and suffering from the inability to end it, if it challenges another very powerful giant, it would only be repeating the mistake of Mr. Quixote.

### The United States Has Morally Formed An Alliance With China and Britain. If Congress Passes The Lend-Lease Plan, It Will Supply Self-Defense Countries While At War.

Washington - The Washington Post editorial stated that the United States has morally formed an important alliance with China, Britain, and Greece, and the US President's address to Congress further proves the strength of this alliance. People here generally believe that the aggressive countries are too involved in making the United States act like electricity, because the German, Italian, and Japanese alliance publicly threatens the United States, and these three countries have stimulated the United States with aggressive remarks and military talks held in Berlin, creating the current policy of the United States. The most important part of the US President's remarks is to show that the unity between the United States and the countries resisting the new order of dictatorship is inseparable. (8th Reuters Telegram)

Washington - President Roosevelt will today submit to Congress an address that is no less important than his previous statement that "we cannot allow democratic countries to surrender." This time, the President will propose recommendations for the new fiscal year, the main point of which is the section on greatly increasing military preparedness and new national defense expenditures that he made the day before. Observers are confident that the President's proposal can be passed by a majority of the members of the House of Representatives, but it may not be able to get more than thirty affirmative votes in the Senate. It is generally believed that once the President's proposed war equipment lend-lease plan is passed by Congress, the existing weapons and new ship production will be entirely used by the President to aid democratic countries in resisting aggressive countries. If so, American destroyers can be used by democratic countries, and if the American Air Force feels that it is possible to lend them to other countries for application, it will also be handled accordingly. It is generally believed that this move is a full answer to the general expectation that American aid will not be realized early enough to cope with Hitler's new offensive this spring.

American Aid to Anti-Aggression Countries, Chongqing All Circles Are Extremely Interested

Chongqing - The Central Daily News published an editorial this morning, stating that President Roosevelt's speech to Congress is enough to serve as a warning to aggressive countries. The future policy direction and determination of the United States can be clarified from this. The United States does not want to see the countries resisting aggression defeated, and will provide them with military supplies and material assistance. Totalitarian countries may call this kind of action a violation of international law or an act of war, but the United States will never succumb to intimidation. As for the Far East, Roosevelt has regarded Australia, Europe, Asia, and Africa as equivalent, so China is also among the countries resisting aggression. Roosevelt's policy is not only a wise policy, but also a policy that follows American public opinion. We firmly believe that the United States will not only prohibit exports to Japan, but also prohibit the import of goods from that country into the United States. Ta Kung Pao also published an editorial, stating that Roosevelt's speech is like a roaring lion, fighting against aggressive countries.

Chongqing - People from all walks of life here are extremely interested in President Roosevelt's State of the Union address, and they all believe that what the President said, "American security has never been threatened by foreign troubles as much as it is today," "If the current war to defend the democratic system fails, the manpower and resources of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia will all be dominated by the conquerors," these few sentences have expressed the emotions of the United States, Britain, and China. In addition, the President also advocated allowing countries resisting aggression to obtain military equipment worth 100 billion yuan from the United States without having to pay cash, and this proposal has extremely important significance, and "is enough to fully express the common will of the American people, regardless of party affiliation," and the US Congress will definitely pass it. The President also said that even if the dictatorial countries claim that the US aid to the democratic countries is an act of war, they should ignore it. This sentence is especially worth pondering.

President Roosevelt's Message, Germany, Italy and Japan Temporarily Do Not Comment

Berlin - No comments have yet been made here on President Roosevelt's message to Congress. According to a responsible person who declared to foreign journalists, the German side is seeking to receive the full text of the message and cannot immediately study it. (8th Hsinmin News Agency Telegram)

Rome - Italian officials have not yet commented on President Roosevelt's message, but political figures stated that Roosevelt's argument is based on the threat of the Axis powers to the Americas, but at the same time stating that the enemy will not send troops across the Atlantic Ocean to attack the United States is somewhat contradictory. Roosevelt's message probably does not want to stimulate the emotions of the anti-interventionists. Roosevelt attempted to deeply impress the American public with the danger of the "Fifth Column," and raised the issue of international police. Roosevelt believes that the peace of 1919 was fairer than the appeasement policy before the Munich Conference. Italian political figures do not want to argue with this, but American people, who value reality, should deeply understand the crux of the current political system in Europe that cannot be maintained, and the reason why the United States must aid Britain twice in twenty years. The political situation that has been shaken twice in twenty years is due to instability and injustice. Roosevelt advocated domestic democracy, but did not advocate democratic principles in the international arena, so that countries with abundant resources and countries with poor resources maintain a balanced state. (8th Hsinmin News Agency Telegram)

Tokyo - Tokyo newspapers unanimously criticized President Roosevelt's message to Congress today, referring to it as tantamount to declaring war on the Axis powers. The Daily News stated that the most noteworthy point in the President's message is the sentence that the United States should become the arsenal of democratic countries, which is tantamount to declaring war on the countries fighting against Britain and China. However, the Japanese Imperial Army has a firm determination to be prepared to break the American plan to transport military equipment through the Japanese blockade line to Chongqing. Hochi Shimbun stated that various provocative attitudes of the United States, such as actively aiding Britain except for participating in the war, lending to China, and the joint British, American, and Australian naval defense against Japan, have created a gap between the United States and the Axis powers. The US President's remarks today are another clear proof that this gap is widening. (8th Reuters Telegram)

Bullitt Delivers Speech, Strongly Advocates Aiding China, Britain and Greece

Chapel Hill - Former US Ambassador to France, Bullitt, delivered his first speech since leaving office last night at the International Relations Club in North Carolina, saying that the surest way to defeat the Axis powers, without risking the danger of totalitarian victory, is to do everything possible to help Britain, China, and Greece. In order to reduce the danger of an Axis victory, the United States must help Britain, China, and Greece with the supplies they need, and not only to protect our own safety. We hate war, so the question of joining this war as a national policy will not arise... all are used to protect our own safety. We hate war, so the question of joining this war as a national policy will not arise. Because we hate war so much, we are willing to use the strength of the people of Britain, China, and Greece to defeat the dictators without the need for our military assistance. We deeply know the consequences of a totalitarian victory, and how we are now opening our eyes to take this risk. At this time, the American people would rather take this risk than not join the war, which can undoubtedly be suppressed. Our non-participation in the war is greatly beneficial to the totalitarian countries. While they are currently attempting to conquer Britain, China, and Greece, it can be asserted that as long as Britain continues to fight like this for one day, no matter how much and in what form our aid is, they will not want to fight with us. The dictators will undoubtedly be more angry, but before conquering Britain, they will never dare to treat us

### The Power of Youth

— Chen Lifu

After Japan fought with us for more than three years, it unintentionally came to a conclusion, saying: "The power of Chinese youth cannot be ignored." Their evidence was that Tang Erhe's son refused to go ashore when his ship passed through Japan on its way to the United States, and that Yin Tong's son was unwilling to study at the school run by the Japanese, and fled alone to a certain university in Kunming to audit classes. (Records of a certain symposium in Tokyo). We cannot dismiss words because of the person, and we should admit that this observation is very accurate. Therefore, I am also willing to cite a few very simple and more active facts to make a commentary for him. As the person in charge of a cultural undertaking, I formally reply to the Japanese that the material part of our organization's school buildings, libraries, instruments, etc., has indeed been destroyed a lot, but the result that the Japanese planned to obtain is exactly the opposite of what they imagined. The most obvious ten examples are that, excluding the occupied areas, the number of students enrolled in schools of all levels, from elementary to university, has increased a lot compared with before the war. We have separate statistical tables published, and everyone can review them. In addition, a part of the youth who have not entered formal schools are participating in various professional training programs to become necessary technical employees in various departments of national construction. Another part, with boiling blood and strong physiques, are all put into various military training institutions, wearing military uniforms and officially carrying guns to serve as soldiers on the front line to defend the country. As for what about the youth in the occupied areas? Speaking of this, I have endless excitement and joy! I am constantly in contact with young students in Chongqing, many of whom have walked from the four northeastern provinces, or Pingjin, Hebei, Shandong and other places. Their clothes are very ragged, but their spirits are very high. They have experienced countless hunger and dangers, but their bodies and willpower have become stronger and stronger. They are no longer children who rely solely on their parents and brothers to live in ignorance. There are such young people arriving in Chongqing and other provinces and cities every day, and there are more and more of them every day. Although their number is not easy to count, taking the registration of middle school students who lost their schooling in the war zone held by the Ministry of Education in Chongqing this summer as an example, the number of people registered in just about ten days has reached three thousand, and the rest can be imagined. This is in terms of the youth who have gone from the occupied areas to the free areas. There are still more who are still in the occupied areas, their situation is more difficult, and their performance is more worthy of admiration. Those who have abandoned their families and everything they own, and are engaged in guerrilla warfare and other practical work, I really don't know how many tens of thousands there are. In other places that are known to be tough, the heroic deeds of young people are even more colorful. As for the countless students who are more gentle in nature or restricted by the environment, they reluctantly go to the schools run by the Japanese, with the sole purpose of relieving the boredom of sitting idly and gaining a little necessary knowledge. They disdain to accept graduation diplomas, and the number is already countless. Look, the Japanese are trying their best to open schools in order to conceal peace. How many people are really willing to enroll, and what kind of ideas do those who have enrolled hold? I am willing to wait for the youth in the occupied areas to answer this question themselves.

The above brief description really cannot exhaust one-millionth of the power that Chinese youth have shown in the war. It is only a brief explanation of the conclusions obtained by the Japanese, with a few examples to explain it. What I want to say now is why Chinese youth have this power, and what results this power will produce.

In answering the first question, I think that the power of Chinese youth is the power of the Chinese nation, and also the power of Chinese culture. I often say that the resistance of our Chinese nation is very majestic. The longer the time, the greater the power, the more severe the invasion, the more tenacious the resistance. From the Yellow Emperor's fight against Chi You to the present, the historical evidence is really countless. (See Student Friend, Volume 1, Issue 6). Why are we able to do this? This is because our Chinese nation has a common belief of "I love life, but I love righteousness even more; I will give up life for righteousness." With this belief, in normal times, we will unite the people of the country to spread education. In times of crisis, we will exert the great power of "unyielding in the face of force and not being corrupted by wealth and honor," and condense this belief, which is completely molded from daily life education. Our general opinion is that a person who has received education is not considered sufficient just because he can read a few books and understand a few formulas. He must first understand the principles of being a person. Conversely, if he understands the principles of being a person, even if he does not read books, he is considered to have received a complete education. The first principle is benevolence. The interpretation of benevolence is "interacting with people as a partner," that is, the way people get along with each other. If you want to be smart and superior and despise others, you cannot be a partner with others, and you will lose the reason for being benevolent. The unbenevolent are called cruel and rebellious, and the cruel and rebellious are called tyrants. Once you become a tyrant, you will do evil wherever you go, and such a person can be killed by everyone.

The second principle is righteousness. Righteousness is a proper behavior that is appropriate according to the place and time, that is, when there is an obstacle to human survival, it is necessary to use various methods to eliminate it, even at the cost of sacrificing life. Many people mistakenly think that the Chinese are the most easily compromised nation, and the thought of being content with one's lot permeates the entire society. In fact, this is entirely a superficial statement. It is true that the Chinese are inherently peace-loving and hate war, but hating war does not mean that they cannot fight, nor does it mean that they are afraid of war. It can be said that they are the most skilled in war. There are many historical examples, which will not be listed here. For example, in this war against Japan, our President has solemnly declared to the world: "We will never give up peace until peace is hopeless, and we will never lightly talk about sacrifice until sacrifice has reached the final moment." These two sentences express our Chinese attitude towards things in the most clear way, so when we have to sacrifice, we are reckless and will not stop until we achieve our goals.

The third principle is propriety. Propriety is interpreted as reason, or as practice, that is, a law that conforms to the principles of nature and responds to human feelings, and that everyone commonly follows. May I ask, in the three and a half years of war, which "organization," large or small, has been able to establish local order without leaving the Japanese forces? Originally, propriety starts with respect and ends with harmony. People who oppose the principles of nature and human feelings are fundamentally rejected in the minds of the Chinese.

The last principle is wisdom. Knowledge is indispensable to everyone, but knowledge is not about reading dead books and memorizing formulas. You must be able to inquire about it, think carefully about it, and distinguish it clearly, and then it is truly useful knowledge. In other words, knowledge is an aid to the first three principles of being a person. The so-called "reading the books of sages, what have you learned?" is to learn the principles of being a person. In the past, Duke Ai asked Confucius who was a good learner. Confucius replied, "There is Yan Hui, who does not transfer his anger and does not repeat his mistakes." This seems to be an irrelevant answer, but in fact Confucius meant that Yan Hui's ability to achieve not transferring his anger and not repeating his mistakes is the best concrete manifestation of his learning.

### Roosevelt Submits Huge Budget to Congress, Allocating Massive Funds for Building Naval, Land, and Air Forces to Cope with Any Contingencies

Washington - President Roosevelt, following his speech to Congress opposing aggressor nations today, announced an unprecedented U.S. defense expenditure. Under this "New Deal plus Defense" budget, if future circumstances do not require an increase, the U.S. will spend $25 billion within three years for defense purposes. The President (said) the government has designated an arms program for the defense of democracy. The world situation forces us to build naval, land, and air forces to be able to cope with and control any contingencies. The President strongly stated that the United States anticipates a continuous stream of expenditures in order to supply genuinely needed munitions to self-defending nations. The new defense program is preparing to establish the most modern mechanized army, with manpower rapidly increasing to about 1.5 million. The President also clearly stated that he does not intend to abandon the social principles of the New Deal while appropriating funds for this great program, and foreshadowed that the government will promulgate important new measures for private industry to prevent manpower and materials from being diverted from national defense needs. The President also hinted that armament profits will be strictly limited, saying that he believes existing laws are insufficient to cope with the profits from national defense work. The figures announced by the President for the budget from June 1941 to June 1942 estimate a total of $17,485,000,000, an increase of 79% over the previous budget, of which 62% is for national defense, an increase of 67% over the previous defense budget. The budget deficit will increase to $9,210,000,000, compared to $6,889,000,000 last year, but the President stated that there is no fear of an increase in national debt. He not only requested an immediate increase in direct taxes but also anticipated that economic activity and national income would both increase to record highs. The President's important speech included the following points: Our defense program refers to battleships, cargo ships, tanks, airplanes, and cannons to protect us against aggression. Our problem in the coming year is to protect our democracy against external pressures and internal weaknesses. No one can predict the final cost of the armament program, as it is still developing and no one can foresee its future. Currently, contracts have been signed for 125 new factories, with more in the planning stage. Goods worth $1 billion have been ordered in the past six months, resulting in factories across the country being ready to rapidly increase their production. Social security programs and agricultural programs that assist farmers will continue to be implemented. If, after this war, it is replaced by a new world where nations coexist peacefully, then the complete elimination of the arms race will be possible. Only in such a world can economic security be restored. President Roosevelt explained the budget figures at a reception for journalists, saying that loans to overseas democracies were not included in the budget because they have not yet been authorized by Congress, but that requests for approval of certain items may be made in the near future. (Reuters, 8th)

Washington - President Roosevelt submitted to Congress yesterday a budget proposal for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1942, with a total expenditure of more than $17 billion. Approximately 62% of this amount is for national defense. Thus, since June 1940, the combined figures for defense expenditures, including those allocated, approved, and proposed, have reached $28,480,000,000. The President stated that the issue of supplying munitions to all democratic nations to enable them to defend themselves must be considered immediately, and that expenditures may exceed this budget. The fiscal year 1942 budget statement shows expenditures of $17,485,000,000. If the expenditures for the aforementioned issue are included, there is a shortfall of $9,210,000,000. Furthermore, the budget appendix includes a $100,000,000 debt from the fiscal year 1940. Therefore, the total expenditure of this budget, after adding this $100,000,000, becomes $17,585,000,000. The President also stated that this expenditure is "a response to the world at war. The terrible world situation has forced us to build a huge naval, land, and air force to cope with any situation. In today's world, a lack of national defense is extremely dangerous. Only by preparing a huge and comprehensive national defense can security be obtained." (United Press, 8th)

### U.S. Forms Supreme Body to Accelerate Arms Production, Implement President Roosevelt's Order, Cooperate to Protect Democracy and Freedom

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday organized a new supreme body to handle the rearmament program led by Mr. Knudsen, Chairman of the National Defense Commission, and labor leader Mr. Hillman. Mr. Knudsen was appointed chairman of this supreme body, and the other members are Colonel Knox and Colonel Stimson. Mr. Knudsen and Mr. Hillman are jointly responsible. President Roosevelt stated that the two will cooperate, but refused to answer questions about whether Mr. Knudsen's power is greater than Mr. Hillman's. The organization of the body was done through an executive order. This is just one of numerous executive orders. The President stated that the body has absolute power in handling events related to obtaining arms and raw materials for the country and abroad. The body will begin work today. The President also issued a statement signed by the four members of the body, saying that what the supreme body faces is not only important but also urgent. (United Press, 8th)

Washington - President Roosevelt established yesterday a supreme body to guide the U.S. defense program and accelerate arms production. The President has established the National Defense Production Administration by executive order. This bureau is nominally under the President's control. At the same time, the President released to the press a statement signed by the four members of the aforementioned guiding body, stating that their current work is not only crucial but also extremely urgent. They will do their utmost to implement President Roosevelt's order to create a democratic arsenal in the United States and hope for the cooperation of all citizens to make this arsenal strong enough to protect democracy and freedom. (Reuters, 8th)

Washington - President Roosevelt submitted to Congress yesterday a budget proposal worth $17 billion. This huge budget is for the period ending June 30, 1942, and 60% of it is for national defense.

### U.S. Naval Aircraft Ranks First in the World

Washington - Rear Admiral Towers, Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, declared yesterday that the U.S. naval aircraft ranks first in the world and predicted that the U.S. Navy's air force will far surpass that of the Axis powers this year. According to the recent U.S. Navy air mission to Britain, the latest U.S. fighter planes are superior to British fighter planes in terms of engine power. He stated that of the 4,000 aircraft originally planned for the Navy, 2,400 are fighter planes. This number far exceeds Japan's production. The Rear Admiral also stated that the Navy hopes to have another 4,000 aircraft in 1941 and 6,300 by 1942, but he stated that he is very dissatisfied with the U.S.'s planned aircraft production. A year ago, the Navy had a total of 2,145 aircraft, and has only increased by 445 since then. Rear Admiral Towers stated that the Navy has ordered 6,122 aircraft, but apart from the 445 ordered in 1940, "very few" are the latest models. He said, "I am very impatient with the slow rate of aircraft production." (United Press, 8th)

### Rumors of German Troops Entering Bulgaria Abound, Soviet Black Sea Fleet Concentrates, Internal Strife Within Romanian Iron Guard Creates Political Instability, Turkey Watches Balkan Situation Develop

Vichy - It is rumored that the Soviet Union's powerful Black Sea Fleet concentrated off the Bulgarian port of Varna last night. This news came at the same time as news of the initial entry of German troops into Bulgaria. According to Vichy sources that are normally reliable, the Soviet fleet is quite menacing, as it is less than 100 miles from the Bulgarian-Turkish border. Informed sources here claim that the rumored German troop movements in Bulgaria directly strike at the Soviet Union. It is rumored that German troops are currently attempting to reach Salonika and the Dardanelles, intending to prevent the Soviet Union from transporting munitions and oil to Turkey and Greece. Vichy news also states that German troops are still pouring into Romania. Government sources here generally believe the news of German troops entering Bulgaria to be credible. It is also generally believed that Germany has taken this action without the Soviet Union's consent, and that it is, in fact, against the Soviet Union's wishes. Regarding the rumor from reliable sources that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet is concentrating off the coast of Bulgaria, developments are expected within days. It is rumored that Soviet troops are continuing to concentrate on the Romanian border. (Havas, 8th)

London - London's "Daily Express" reported this morning that a Soviet battleship in the Black Sea sailed up the Danube River yesterday and anchored near Sulina. It is expected that if Germany takes new action in the Balkans, the Soviet Union will take over this port. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that there have been clashes between German and Romanian troops in the province of Moldavia. This news comes from the Romanian border. It is also reported that the Iron Guard has erupted in internal strife and is fighting fiercely. (International News Service, 8th)

Budapest - News arriving here today states that Soviet and German troops are increasing daily on the Romanian border, facing off across the border. Amidst this situation, internal strife erupted in Romania again last night. Under these circumstances, there are signs that the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Bulgaria may unite to resist Germany's plan to invade Bulgaria. Balkan diplomatic circles hear that as disputes increase between the Soviet Union's Bessarabia and Romania's Moldavia border, the Soviet Union may take action against Romania. Romania has been cut off from communication with the outside world for three days. Rumors circulate that the faction of the Iron Guard in Romania that supports Antonescu is engaged in fierce fighting with the extremist faction of the group, resulting in the deaths of many Iron Guard members. Terrorists and saboteurs are also quite active in Romania. Since Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov returned home after a week-long visit to Vienna, it is generally believed that Bulgaria, with the support of the Soviet Union, does not intend to change its policy of not joining the Axis. Well-informed sources say that the Turkish government has notified Bulgaria that if foreign troops enter Bulgaria, Turkey will no longer remain neutral. (International News, 8th)

Bucharest - News from border areas indicates that the signs of a German plan to quickly cross the Danube River into Bulgaria were fewer yesterday than on Monday. Some observers believe that the German military's action of passing through Bulgaria to open a line to Greece will be postponed until spring. Military experts say that the troops and supplies transported from Germany are concentrated in major towns on the southern border of Romania. This concentration of troops is sufficient to provide military assistance to Italy in its operations against Greece when necessary. Unconfirmed reports were received here yesterday morning that German troops had entered Bulgaria and occupied several Bulgarian mountain passes. Diplomatic circles are unwilling to believe this, and military authorities also do not believe it. (United Press, 8th)

### German and Soviet Forces Face Off, Bulgarian Situation Delicate, Bulgarian Premier Returns to Capital from Vienna, Denies Holding Negotiations with Germany

Stockholm - A newspaper here states that, according to news from Berlin, it is expected that there will be no new negotiations or agreements between Germany and Bulgaria. Another newspaper's Berlin dispatch emphasizes the delicate nature of the Bulgarian situation, saying that there are conflicting interests, each seeking to extend its influence in Bulgaria, so Bulgarian Premier Filov will not leave the country at this time. (Recently, there were rumors that Filov was ill and would leave Bulgaria to seek medical treatment.) The dispatch also states that German and Soviet interests cannot be reconciled in Bulgaria. If Bulgaria refuses German demands, it will likely rely on the support of the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 8th)

Sofia - Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov returned to the capital yesterday afternoon from Vienna. Filov said, "The news reported by the United States about my visit to Germany is not accurate." He declined to make further comments. Well-informed sources believe he did not receive any German ultimatum demanding that German troops pass through Bulgaria. (United Press)

Berlin - Yesterday, the German Foreign Office told foreign reporters that it had not heard of any meeting between Bulgarian Premier Filov and the German Foreign Minister. (Haitong Telegraph, 8th)

Bern - The "Basler Tages-Zeitung"'s Berlin dispatch states that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop reportedly met with Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov on Sunday. However, the German government's refusal to publicly discuss the state of German-Bulgarian relations suggests that the talks were fruitless and that German-Bulgarian relations are quite tense.

There are still various unresolved issues between Romania and the Soviet Union, such as the repatriation of Bessarabians in Romania and Romanians in Bessarabia. Romania has recently formed a new committee, which is expected to resolve these outstanding issues. (Reuters, 8th)

Istanbul - Turkish Prime Minister Saydam recently proposed that all factories manufacturing luxury goods be ordered to convert to the production of necessities for national defense. (United Press, 7th)

### British Forces Launch Blitzkrieg, Tobruk Fortress Encircled, El Adem Airfield Occupied by British Forces, American-Made Bombers Appear Over North Africa

British Army Headquarters, Bardia - As British aircraft bombed Tobruk and Tripoli last night, the primary defensive point of Tobruk, El Adem airfield, fell into the hands of rapidly advancing British forces. Forty Italian aircraft damaged by British air force were captured by British army. Martin-style American-made bombers participated in the operation when British aircraft attacked Italian forces. A large fire broke out in Tobruk and was visible from Bardia, 70 miles away. Italian warships and merchant ships in Tripoli were subjected to a barrage of bombs, and naval barracks and other military targets in Tobruk were hit. British sources indicated that as they encircle Tobruk, they may divide their forces to attack Benghazi to the west, to allow British forces to gain an advantageous position and defeat Tobruk in one fell swoop. (International News Service, 8th)

Cairo - A communiqué released by British Middle East Air Force Command stated that Tripoli, 750 miles west of Bardia, was again heavily bombed by British air force bombers on the night of January 6th. British aircraft dropped tons of bombs on motorized vessels in the port, causing continuous explosions, with thick smoke rising straight up. A bomb struck a large motorized vessel in the middle, causing a loud explosion. Several small cargo ships may also have been hit. Customs houses and docks were set on fire, and the power plant also suffered significant damage. All aircraft returned safely. The communiqué continued that British air force heavy bombers also attacked Tobruk, where barracks, storage depots, and concentrated motorized transport vehicles were hit and caught fire, with flames burning fiercely and visible from 30 miles away. All aircraft returned without loss. (Reuters, 8th)

London - British Empire forces are currently advancing towards Tobruk with all their might, but the General Command is maintaining considerable silence on the details of military operations. More detailed information will have to wait until the entire offensive plan is finalized before it can be released. The transportation of supplies to the front-line troops is proceeding in an extremely orderly manner day and night along a 200-mile desert road. (Reuters, 8th)

London - A commentator on Rome Radio broadcasted a warning to the Italian people today, saying that Italy may be forced to continue making concessions in North Africa, and encouraged the people not to be discouraged. This broadcast came after British forces occupied El Adem, the southern Italian air force base of Tobruk, and made contact with the outer defensive lines of Tobruk. British aircraft are now bombing Tobruk and Italian airfields further west, including Tripoli, day and night. (Reuters, 8th)

### Italian Premier's Spokesperson Reaffirms War Goals; Cabinet Issues Proclamation Vowing Unwavering Commitment to Alliance

Lord Baden-Powell was born in London in 1857 and was fond of various sports from a young age, excelling above other children. In 1876, he considered pursuing a religious career, following in his father's footsteps, but later changed his mind and took the army entrance exam, which he passed. He then served in South Africa and other places, where he distinguished himself in battle. In 1908, he initiated the Boy Scout movement to fulfill his long-held aspirations. In 1910, he retired from the military to devote himself fully to Boy Scout affairs. Soon, the Boy Scout movement spread worldwide.

In 1912, he married Miss Olave Soames, and his wife later engaged in organizing the Girl Guides, now serving as the Chief Guide of the World. It has been known that his Lordship has been ill for some time. Several months ago, there were rumors that he had passed away in Kenya, but it was later found to be incorrect.

### Random Thoughts on the European War (20) (9) - British Officer's Diary on the Western Front

Some time ago, I went to inspect the front line at Sedan. I firmly believed that if our side could resolutely resist with a disciplined army, the German army would have to pay a price of 500,000 casualties to break through our lines. But what happened? The fortifications were layered deeply, extending five miles, yet the German army drove straight through with a loss of only 500 men. The reason for this can only be attributed to the fact that the defenses of Sedan, which were considered the strongest, were defended by the weakest troops. The majority of the defenders were Parisians with the worst morale. When the Stuka dive bombers arrived, there were actually not many casualties. They only endured two hours before fleeing like frightened old women, covering their ears with their hands. It is no wonder that the officers of the general staff shed tears.

We immediately took emergency measures. The Air Force Commander had obtained the consent of General Gort, Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, and General Georges, Chief of Staff of the French Army, to request the British Cabinet to urgently dispatch the Home Defence Bomber Squadron to France to assist in the battle and salvage the situation, but it was not implemented. The Air Force Commander, with the approval of the General Headquarters, dispatched four squadrons of fighter planes from the Air Force to escort the bombers. Modern warfare is indeed rapidly changing, and we are all anxiously waiting.

General Sweeney, Director of the Second Department of the Military Liaison Group, had already made arrangements with the General Headquarters. The Bomber Command promised to dispatch 100 aircraft under the command of the Air Force, which should satisfy General Georges. However, the Air Force Commander had lost the opportunity to deal a severe blow to the enemy. The major effort to boost morale and the important decisions mentioned above were all too late. The plan to inflict a fatal blow on the enemy was never implemented. Caution and safety first caused us to miss the opportunity.

10:00 PM: Seventy bombers, escorted by several fighter planes, "participated in the battle at Sedan. They flew very low and lost 37 aircraft. But they have accomplished their operational goals. The three pontoon bridges built by the Germans have all been destroyed. The French counterattack has even recovered the high ground around the salient, achieving a local success."

General Georges plans to launch a second counterattack tomorrow in the hope of retaking Sedan. The French army is prepared to participate in the battle with 60 bombers, and the British Bomber Command has also decided to launch another large-scale attack.

May 15: No need to say more, I'll record it again tomorrow. It was only this afternoon that 26 German aircraft bombed the railway, and an hour later, I went out to inspect the damage. The bombs dropped by the German aircraft were mostly delayed-action bombs, and they are now beginning to explode. The German aircraft dropped bombs quite accurately, causing severe damage. The station has caught fire.

At breakfast, I read the newspaper. The situation is quite worrying. The enemy has crossed the Meuse River along a fifty-mile line from Dinant to Sedan. But as of this moment, the German army seems to be confined to the left bank of the river. The Ninth Army is resisting at Sedan. In the direction of Dinant, our counterattack has recovered some lost ground.

This morning, a large number of refugees passed through here, most of them riding bicycles, and some in dilapidated vehicles. In the morning, the railway was heavily bombed by enemy aircraft. I was shaving when a large iron bomb flew over my head with a whooshing sound and landed only a foot away. Everything is very depressing, but perhaps not hopeless. The war is still in its early stages, and there is no reason to despair, but the French army here is clearly disappointing. According to unofficial talks, there is talk of the French army retreating to the Aisne River. But I don't understand how the French army and the British army on the left wing will maintain contact. This question needs to be answered now.

2:00 PM: The news from the British army seems to be good. Just now, news came that the commander of the Seventh Army has come south to take over the Ninth Army. The commander of the Ninth Army has been "dismissed" and it is rumored that he has been executed, but I don't know if this is true.

The story of the fall of the Maastricht bridge is like a myth. A man dressed as a civilian walked to the east side of the bridge and asked the guards in a friendly manner to let him pass to say a few words to a companion on the west side of the bridge. The guards agreed, and he crossed the bridge, spoke for a few minutes, and then walked back with his friend, approaching the guards. The second person suddenly struck the guard dead like an assassin and ran back to the west side of the bridge, cutting the fuse of the land mine that had been buried. At the same time, the person on the east side grabbed the deceased guard's weapon to prevent others from interfering. The accuracy of the German army's timing is truly astonishing. Within a few minutes, paratroopers and gliders were descending from the sky, landing on top of the Dutch and Belgian fortifications on the west side of the bridge. While the defenders were still confused, the German army had surrounded the fortifications, throwing hand grenades into the observation holes and bombs onto the gun emplacements. In a short time, a fortification had become a living hell, with bombs thrown into the open doors and turrets. In less than an hour, the German army had occupied the bridgehead at Maastricht. According to our estimates, the German army would have to sacrifice 50,000 men to succeed, but now they have only lost 300 men!

Sedan fell due to air force bombing. The French army's retreat was cut off and they collapsed two hours later. The bridgehead at Maastricht was taken by the enemy silently. This is what military strategists call the clever use of surprise.

Finally, some good news came. It is said that the British army has launched a successful counterattack in Leuven. Although this is not credible, it may boost morale somewhat. I am afraid that the French army has given up the idea of ​​recovering the Meuse River positions. French tactics seem to be very different from their traditional spirit.

8:00 PM: The French military report is extremely bad. The German army has expanded its foothold on the left bank of the Meuse River. From Chinley to somewhere below Sedan, the whole area is full of German troops and has advanced west to La Roche. La Roche is north of Laon, only forty miles from our army's headquarters in Sernay.

10:00 PM: General d'Astier has closed the headquarters and left in a hurry. The situation is extremely urgent. We have also decided to retreat and plan to go to the British Air Force headquarters with the Air Force Commander at 3:00 tomorrow morning. These three hours are extremely hectic. All important items, such as steel filing cabinets, map cases, wall charts, typewriters, and desks, are being packed into the headquarters' transport vehicles. Everyone's boxes and luggage are also all packed by 1:30, and even the remaining half bottle of cherry wine is taken along.

May 16: I, Wu Daoer, Ock Bowler, and driver Hogen drove to the British Air Force headquarters in the town of Coromée at 10:00 PM. In addition to our personal pistols, we carried two rifles, but they would be useless if we encountered enemy tank units. The retreat of the advance headquarters of the British Air Force in the north has now been completed.

This morning, things are very clear. If the French army had the will to fight, or if their morale had not completely collapsed, the Allied forces would still have hope of victory. The German army broke into the French army's lines, forming a wide salient. Their forces are exhausted, and there cannot be a large amount of supplies and fuel nearby. In the past, Napoleon III's army was completely defeated in the Battle of Sedan. If the French army could attack the left flank of the German army to cut off this protruding point, it might be possible to turn defeat into victory and have the German army meet the same fate as Napoleon III.

There is no quick decision in the UK either. We desperately need 200 fighter planes to counter the German bombers, but the authorities do not attach importance to them. The Air Force Department said that they would reconsider the urgent requests of the past two days. As in the last European war, defending London is often considered more important than defending France. In my personal opinion, the only justifiable excuse for France to complain about Britain is the lack of fighter plane assistance.

Today, we talked to a French officer who described how the French army defending Sedan and the German bombing destroyed their resistance. He said that the French army had been psychologically conquered and could not hold out. We have heard this more than once. This situation is all caused by dive bombers. Dive bombers can be checked by fighter planes. If we had 500 aircraft to counter the enemy fighter planes, Sedan could have been kept. The Cabinet may not know anything about what happened yesterday, but I think they will change their policy. From the newspapers, it seems that the British public is not depressed by the defeat. We all remember the Battle of the Marne in the last European war, so we all have the dream that history may repeat itself. (To be continued)

### Grains: Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 and Siam Rice Still Operating Secretly Off-Market; Local Rice Finally Declines by One to Two Yuan Yesterday

Imported rice prices are still being held up by those hoarding goods, but with continuous arrivals and crowded orders, the original packaged selling price of the returned Yinghua company has seen a sharp drop. Therefore, the spot price of Xiaojiao has already opened for sale at the limited price of 79 yuan, and the secondary price is 78 yuan. Due to the ongoing period of price controls, the actual sales of broken rice and rice tea are sluggish, and sellers have been unable to raise prices again, so they can only be sold within the limited price range. However, there is still a lack of official transactions for Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 and Siam No. 1 and No. 2 fire-polished rice, etc., and they are still operating secretly. There are still rumors of off-market surcharges and allocated prices. New transactions for imported rice orders have not been agreed upon due to the high exchange rate cut, but the cut price can still be transported, and foreign merchants are also soliciting sales. Moreover, the previously ordered rice is also arriving one after another. Therefore, the returned original packaged rice continues to trend downward. This is because people's hearts are calm, new hoards are waiting and watching, and those with floating profits are quite intending to close out within the year. Therefore, the spot price of Xiaojiao rice is only opened at 93 yuan, while Saigon rice has arrived at the original package with its own expenses only opened at 96 yuan, and the transfer freight is only 98 yuan, a sharp drop of three to five yuan compared to the previous market. That is, the land cargo of Xiaojiao rice in mid-January is also only 83 yuan, a decrease of one yuan compared to the previous day. Special rice opened at 77 yuan, then 75 and a half yuan, 75 yuan. Broken pointed rice is as high as 74 yuan, then down to around 70 yuan, and sun-dried rice is only 66 to 67 yuan. The total volume of returned original packages throughout the day was more than 500 tons, and there are less than 3,000 bags of spot goods.

The arrival of national rice such as thick and thin japonica rice is still sporadic. However, most cargo owners, seeing that imported rice seems to be weakening and declining straight, no longer have the heart to hold on and have become more willing to sell. At the same time, the wooden street stores are unwilling to prepare much due to the high price pressure, and the sales route has also suddenly weakened. Under these double circumstances, the selling price suddenly fell by one or two yuan. For example, Kunshan hu saw that white japonica rice, except for high-quality goods, still requires around 105 yuan, while those in the middle range are only 101 to 103 yuan. Qingjiao hu saw that thin indica rice, a large market cargo, has already entered the 100 yuan mark, selling for 98 to 99 yuan, but high-quality goods sell for 101 to 100 yuan, and the original package is 104 yuan.

The sales route for glutinous rice is originally the most sought after. At this time, with other goods all showing fatigue, the market color becomes even more sluggish, and the price continues to fall by the yuan. Yili white opened at 92 yuan to 90 yuan, Hong Kong goods opened at 81 yuan, then down to 78 yuan, glutinous indica ordinary 72 and a half yuan, then down to around 70 yuan.

On the one hand, the source of imported rice arrives, one after another. Yesterday, the Taikoo company's Taiyuan wheel transported 8,439 bags from Hong Kong, stopped at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to unload. Also, the French company's Jindiya arrived yesterday morning, transporting 6,026 bags of imported rice directly from Saigon, and another 7,459 bags of corn, stopped at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou to unload.

### Cotton Market Mediocre

The current cotton situation is worse than yesterday, and the factory's办胃 is particularly astringent. In addition, the sales of cotton yarn are narrow, and there is very little development for raw materials, so the future of the cotton market is still difficult to昂昇.

### Repeated Demands for Improved Treatment - British Tramways Halt Service Yesterday - Company Has Accommodated Demands as Much as Possible - Inconvenience to Transportation, All Parties Hope for a Quick Resolution - Rumor of Tramway Workers Resuming Work This Morning

Workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company in the International Settlement, having proposed conditions for improved treatment, with workers from the Baikai Road and depot machine workers taking the lead by engaging in go-slow action the day before yesterday, from yesterday morning, the engine, vehicle, and depot workers have completely gone on strike, resulting in the complete cessation of all streetcar services. The company has responded to the conditions proposed by the workers, and there are reports that some have advised the workers to resume work first and await resolution. Tramway workers have accepted the advice and are expected to resume work this morning.

Strike Again - Tram Service Halted

On September 20th of last year, workers of the tramway company staged a strike over improved treatment. Fortunately, through the mediation of Yu Qiaqing and others, a resolution was reached, and workers resumed work on the 28th. Today, all workers, seeing the recent soaring rice prices and insufficient wages to maintain a livelihood, have once again proposed conditions for improved treatment. Coppersmiths at the Baikai Road depot took the lead in a go-slow action the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, all of the more than two thousand engine and vehicle workers responded completely, unanimously going on strike, causing all streetcars and trackless trolleys within the Public Settlement to be forced to stop operating and completely cease service. At the same time, French trams also ceased operating into the Public Settlement.

Conditions Proposed - Five Items

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the workers yesterday that the five conditions proposed by the tramway workers for improved treatment are: (1) A uniform wage increase of 50% for all vehicle and engine workers. (2) An annual bonus of one-tenth of a year's salary (including wages, subsidies, rice subsidies, etc.) and a year-end special bonus of one month's salary. (3) Monthly wage increases for drivers and coppersmiths should be the same as those for ticket sellers: four workers. (4) The company should deduct one yuan for the workers' welfare fund paid to the union when paying wages. (5) Additional ticket-selling personnel should be added to the 14th and 15th trackless trolley lines. The above five items have been formally submitted by the workers to the company authorities.

Company Depot - Tightly Protected

After the workers went on strike, the company's manager, Bowler, accompanied by the tramway superintendent and the Chinese compradore, Hu Zi, inspected the Jing'an Temple station and the Baikai Road main depot yesterday morning. At the same time, the Public Settlement police authorities, in order to protect the company and the depot and maintain order, yesterday dispatched additional detectives from various police stations to station at the company headquarters on North Suzhou Road, the Jing'an Temple station on Hardoon Road, and the Baikai Road main depot, taking strict precautions to prevent incidents. At the same time, the political department has sent detectives to investigate the truth of the strike in order to allow the industrial department to find a way to mediate.

The Company's Response - Considered Satisfactory

The company has responded to the workers' demands and hopes that the workers will first resume work to maintain public transportation. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency who inquired with the workers yesterday, the company has agreed to submit the first item, a 50% wage increase, to the company's board of directors for discussion and decision. For the second item, the bonus, the company agreed to pay an annual bonus of one one-hundred-and-twentieth of a year's salary, but calculated on wages, excluding various subsidies, and agreed to allow workers to borrow three weeks' wages in advance at the end of the year. For the third item, the wage increase, the company agreed to consider it further and then discuss it. For the fourth item, the withholding of union dues, the company agreed to discuss and resolve it. For the fifth item, the addition of ticket sellers, the company agreed to hand it over to the vehicle department for handling.

All Sectors Hope for a Rational Resolution

According to a Western employee of the tramway company yesterday, the company increased workers' wages last October, and the reason for this renewed strike is unknown, which is extremely surprising. In addition to increasing wages by 150% last year, living allowances, rice subsidies, and housing subsidies were also given. The company is determined to do its best to help workers solve their livelihood problems, but the workers' actions have made the company unbearable. The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the workers did not state the reasons for the strike, which shows that someone must be inciting political unrest behind the scenes, but striking near the New Year also seems to lack a reason. However, both parties agreed last year to give an additional 50% bonus, and all sectors hope for a rational resolution to this.

Tramway Workers - Rumored to Allow Resumption of Work

Tramway workers accepted advice yesterday and agreed to resume work starting this morning. However, some engine workers expressed dissatisfaction with the company's response and did not agree to resume work immediately. The workers' side has advised all workers separately, planning to resume work first this morning to maintain public transportation within the Settlement. At the same time, the company's Chinese compradore, Hu, went to the Jing'an Temple station on Hardoon Road yesterday to advise the workers, urging them to resume work first and then find a way to resolve the conditions. According to Mr. Yu, a representative of the workers, who met with a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency last night, resumption of work is expected this morning.

Workers' Conflict - Two Injured

At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, a large number of workers gathered at the Jing'an Temple station on Hardoon Road. After receiving the news, the Jing'an Temple police station, fearing an accident, immediately dispatched a large number of detectives and three police cars to take precautions. It was reported that during the process of workers sending representatives to advise workers to resume work, an unfortunate incident of conflict between workers and workers occurred. Engine worker Wang Axiao and vehicle worker Li Lansheng were injured and were immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road by ambulance for treatment. It is reported that the injuries were minor and not life-threatening.

Abrupt Incident - Passengers Suffer

After all trams in the Public Settlement stopped operating, all trams on the five routes in the French Concession and trackless trolleys on the 24th, 17th, and 18th routes stopped operating into the Public Settlement. Due to the abruptness of the incident, most passengers waited at the station for a long time before reluctantly leaving. The number of passengers on public buses suddenly increased sharply. The British-owned public bus company added all the buses in the depot to operation, but it still could not reduce the crowded situation.

### Relief for Shaoxing Rice Famine - Food Company Organized

According to sources from Shaoxing people in Shanghai, the rice famine in Shaoxing has become increasingly severe since the winter. Due to traffic obstruction and poor sources, there is less and less rice stored in the market, and there is even a shortage of rice everywhere. In order to relieve the urgent need for food, all parties have organized a food company to purchase rice in groups, with a planned capital of one million yuan, which will be recognized by the business community and various urban and rural districts and towns according to the size of the population. At present, 300,000 yuan of commercial shares, 100,000 yuan from the Men Anchang district, 50,000 yuan from Dongguan, and 200,000 yuan from other sectors have been raised, totaling 650,000 yuan, which has exceeded more than half. Other districts are still working hard to raise funds, and it is expected that the full amount will be reached in mid-month, and the company will be formally established to purchase rice from Shangjiang County in Zhejiang Province and transport it to provide relief. The serious situation can be reduced.

As a result, the trial was adjourned to 2:30 p.m. today for retrial.

Ma Chonggao of the Public Settlement Municipal Council, Zhu Yigui of the French Concession Municipal Council, and Zhong Jinchen of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce were present, and the discussion began immediately. (1) Whether the prices of various foreign rice should be re-evaluated. It was resolved that:

The above four types are calculated by bag, which is the original bag of the British Chinese Company, and will be strictly implemented from today.

Brokers Enter - Temporarily Allowed to Resume

(2) The Rice Broker Friendship Association sent a letter stating that the two-week suspension of entry has expired, and requesting to enter the market to resume business in order to maintain their livelihood. It was resolved that: It is true that the brokers are experiencing livelihood difficulties, and they should be allowed to temporarily resume business in the market from the 9th of this month to see the effect. However, if there is any overstepping of boundaries in the future, they should still be cracked down on at any time, and their entry into the market should be stopped without leniency. As for the Broker Friendship Association, it has designated Cai Weixiang and Shao Qingfu to supervise the market and has formulated intermediary measures: (1) In addition to holding a rice market entry certificate, members of this association will also be issued temporary badges by this association and hung on their lapels for identification, in order to prevent non-members from taking the opportunity to mix in and cause trouble. (2) Members of this association will send cadres to the market every day to conduct strict investigations, and if there is any overstepping of boundaries, they will be reported without leniency. Disciplinary measures will be stipulated: first offense, suspension from entering the market for three months; second offense, one year; third offense, permanent cancellation of membership. (3) Members of this association should uniformly abide by the assessed price limits, and if the seller exceeds the price limit, they will be strictly rejected. If there is any violation of this rule, membership will be canceled. (4) If there is any overstepping of boundaries in the market, members should immediately report it and refuse to mediate, and must not protect it. (5) Members of this association must strictly abide by the above regulations, otherwise they will be punished according to the regulations.

Reward Whistleblowing - Safeguard Operations

In order to stabilize people's food, alleviate residents' pain, and maintain long-term social order, the authorities of the two Settlements have repeatedly adopted effective measures and put them into practice. Now, in order to completely eliminate the panic about food and stop various illegal transactions in the market, the two authorities have decided to reward whistleblowing. All citizens who know the inside story can report to the authorities as much as possible, and at the same time protect legitimate rice merchants. All rice transportation can be facilitated, and when goods are shipped within the time limit, generous and legal profits will be given as a reward. The authorities will also help rice merchants purchase large quantities of food from all over the country. It is hoped that rice merchants will work together and not put the law aside, cooperate with the authorities, and jointly stabilize the entire food supply in Shanghai.

Association Orders Rice - Arrives in Port Mid-Month

The Shanghai Civil Food Adjustment Association has successively entrusted Shenji Foreign Company and Nanyang Enterprise Company to purchase a total of 20,050 bags of No. 2 Saigon rice from Saigon. 11,432 bags were loaded before the new year. However, there are still 13,250 bags of No. 2 Gong rice from the 22nd to 29th batches that Shenji Foreign Company commissioned from October 4th to November 14th, and only 4,532 bags were loaded last year. 8,718 bags have not yet been shipped to Shanghai. According to the association's report yesterday, the above-mentioned 8,718 bags of Gong rice have been loaded onto the "Granlund" of the Hualun Foreign Company and left Gong on the 5th of this month, and are expected to arrive in port around the 17th of this month. At that time, it will be distributed to the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th batch of subscribers.

### Rice Prices Rise Sharply - Deaths from Starvation Increase Daily

The climate in Shanghai has been extremely warm in recent days, as if it were autumn. Although there are few deaths from freezing among beggars and poor people who are homeless on the streets, there are quite a few deaths from starvation. According to the records of the Pushan Villa the day before yesterday, a total of 36 adult corpses and 43 child corpses were collected. The soaring rice prices pose a serious threat to the lives of the poor.

### Five Labor Disputes - Gradually Resolved

Guangci Labor Dispute Begins Mediation - Postal Workers Ask to Await Reply

The labor strike by all employees of Guangci Hospital demanding improved treatment has suddenly lasted for ten days. More than a dozen new workers have also left the hospital one after another. All parties have donated to the labor side. The political department of the French police has taken on mediation and is gradually making progress. At the same time, the Catholic Huiliangji Bishop also sympathizes with the hardships of the hospital workers and, seeing that most of the labor side are Catholics, cannot bear to sit idly by while this unfortunate labor dispute persists. He has also advised the hospital director, Father Wan Erdian, and representatives of the labor side to resolve the matter as soon as possible. It is rumored that a satisfactory resolution and resumption of work may be achieved within this week.

Orphanage

The labor dispute involving more than 1,000 employees of the Xujiahui Tushan Bay Orphanage occurred on the 3rd of this month and has now been resolved. The original rice subsidy of 4 yuan and 5 jiao has been abolished. Each worker receives an additional rice subsidy of two dou per month, and one dou for children. On the 6th, all employees of the printing department and the distribution department resumed work first. The coppersmiths' workshop continued to resume work, while the carpenters' workshop has been temporarily closed, with priests introducing other opportunities to the carpenters. The drawing department has changed from contracting to piecework.

Convent

All the female workers of the Xujiahui Convent established by the Catholic Church and all the female school workers of the Xuhui Girls' Middle School and Elementary School have requested improved treatment and higher wages because their monthly wages are only three or four yuan. Because no results have been obtained, a go-slow action has occurred. Yesterday, the hospital and the Xuhui authorities were said to have agreed to increase wages as appropriate, but they must first resume work and wait for a solution, so that it will not expand.

Commercial Dispute

The labor-management dispute at the Commercial Press has not yet made any progress. The labor side sent three representatives to Hong Kong some time ago to directly request from the person in charge in Hong Kong. It is heard that they have not obtained any results and will return to Shanghai today.

Postal Workers' Annual Bonus

The Shanghai Postal Administration's postal workers will be issued an annual bonus of one month's salary, according to the order of the General Post Office, which will be issued according to salary. This is the same for postal workers all over the country. However, postal workers in Shanghai requested that the administration issue the bonus based on salary plus living allowance because of the difficulty of living. The Shanghai Administration immediately telegraphed the Kunming General Post Office for instructions and followed the instructions. Fortunately, the postal workers were able to understand this real situation, so they continued to work as usual before receiving a reply from the General Post Office, which did not affect the receipt and dispatch of mail in the society.

### Tax on White Russian Emblem Proceeds - Large Sum Obtained - Now Used to Shelter Beggars

The Continental Daily News reports that the Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Committee has announced a tax on the income of White Russian emigrants, and the proceeds have expanded the charitable work among White Russians. A new White Russian beggar shelter has been set up near Tangshan Road and Yanping Road. At present, only 25 people are being sheltered. The White Russian Emigrant Committee is also looking for suitable housing in the French Concession to set up another White Russian beggar shelter. The collection of income tax is currently proceeding "satisfactorily." About 5,000 yuan was collected in November, and about 8,000 yuan may be collected in November.

### More Than 1,000 Poor People in the Winter Shelter

The winter shelter organized by the Charity Organization United Relief Association has now sheltered more than 1,100 poor people since it was organized in the open space of Yan's house on Zhaofeng Road last month. The shelter provides two meals of white rice per day, one jin per meal, which is enough to fill their stomachs.

### The So-Called Shanghai West Temporary Agreement - Rumored to be Signed in the Short Term - The Municipal Council Did Not Approve the Agreement Yesterday

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post says that according to sources from the "City", the temporary agreement between the Municipal Council and the "City Government" has been revised and will be signed finally in the near future. The revised temporary agreement has been submitted to the Ning side and is expected to be returned in a few days, and then preparations for signing will begin. It is heard that the revised agreement is not significantly different from the basic agreement signed by Fancrin, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, and the "City" side in February of last year. The methods agreed upon by both sides regarding police and taxation are expected to be implemented soon, and then negotiations on the jurisdiction of the Chinese-French Court in the First Special District will be carried out. The Japanese newspaper reported today (the 8th) that the Municipal Council will hold a regular meeting this afternoon to consider the draft agreement between the Council and the "City Government" regarding police powers in the Western District, and will approve it. This draft agreement will also be approved by the Ning side next week. By then, the three-year-old case between the Municipal Council and the "City Government" will come to an end.

Municipal Council Meeting - Not Passed

Yesterday, the Municipal Council held a meeting to discuss the "temporary agreement" on the organization of "joint police powers" in the area where roads are built across the boundary. As a result, it has not yet been passed. A spokesperson for the Municipal Council told reporters yesterday that this plan still needs to be considered carefully and that there is no decision in sight. The spokesperson did not explain whether the Municipal Council had to postpone the discussion due to insufficient time or for other reasons. He only said that this matter has not yet been decided, and he did not say when the second meeting to discuss this matter will be held. Major Bowden, the head of the police department, also attended the Municipal Council meeting yesterday. Afterwards, he told reporters that he could not say whether this "agreement" could be signed and established in the near future, because this matter is no longer in his hands.

### Imminent Increase in Contributions by the Public Works Department; All Sectors Find Burden Unbearable; Decision of Taxpayers' Meeting Highly Valued; The Bureau Announces Difficult Financial Situation

To compensate for its 20 million yuan deficit, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, upon the proposal of the Chairman of the Public Works Department, the Consular Body has scheduled a special meeting of taxpayers at 2:30 pm on the 23rd of this month at the Race Club on Bubbling Well Road to pass a further 40% increase in contributions. Chinese and foreign taxpayers believe that since the Incident, the Public Works Department has frequently increased taxes and contributions, and the public burden has already become very heavy. At a time when prices are high and the economy of citizens is on the verge of bankruptcy, another increase in contributions is like draining the pond to catch all the fish. The future is worrying and unbearable to imagine. Therefore, all parties attach great importance to the discussion of the increased contributions at the special taxpayers' meeting on the 23rd of this month and agree that all sectors of the Chinese community, because they cannot bear the burden, will show a firm opposition.

Reasons for the Public Works Department's Increase in Contributions

Yesterday, the Public Works Department issued an article stating the reasons for the increased contributions, detailing the financial shortfall. The full text is recorded as follows: The special taxpayers' meeting is about to be held. The convocation of this meeting is specifically to discuss the Bureau's proposed collection of a 40% surcharge on taxes and the increase in various license fees. This article is specially written to explain the reasons for the increased contributions to inform the taxpayers.

Financial Situation Fully Recorded in the Report

The budget for the Bureau's expenses for this year has not yet been submitted to the relevant committees for review. However, the financial needs are now very clear. The first thing to understand is that unless public safety and sanitation are impaired, it is impossible to continue to save expenses through reorganization or restriction of various administrations or dismissal of staff. The Bureau has established an independent Economic Committee, which has met many times during this municipal year. Its report has been published in detail in the Bureau's gazette. Taxpayers are invited to consult and study it. In the future, the Bureau's expenses, whether increased or decreased, will depend on the level of prices and exchange rates. These factors directly affect the temporary living allowance paid to employees.

Huge Shortfall in Regular Expenses

When the budget for the previous year was prepared, it was felt that the increase in various expenses was greater than the income. Therefore, the surcharge on taxes was increased by 50%. However, the increase in contributions was only implemented in the second half of the year. It was expected that the income in the second half of the year could offset the expenses. At the same time, it was hoped that a balanced budget could be produced this year. However, due to the tightening of foreign exchange and rising prices, the regular expenses exceeded the original budget by about 7.8 million yuan. Although the income exceeded the budget by 4.6 million yuan, the total shortfall for the year was estimated at 8.775 million yuan (the original budget listed more than 5.573 million yuan). The above figures are rough estimates. As for the final deficit, it may be very different from the above number.

Increased Benefits Have a Significant Impact

The temporary living allowance paid to employees was 40% at the beginning of last year. By October, this allowance had been increased twice. At the same time, the rice subsidy paid to Chinese employees was also greatly increased. In addition, the cost of various human and material resources has increased sharply. Therefore, although the income is relatively abundant, it cannot match the expenditure situation. Last year, all employees expressed dissatisfaction with the salary issue. The number of foreign employees who left or resigned was estimated at 170. Later, serious unrest occurred among the Chinese police due to the issue of remuneration. As a result, the Bureau had to comprehensively consider the salaries and allowances of all employees. As a result, it was decided to increase various allowances and rice subsidies again, which cost 1 million yuan per month, of which 714,000 yuan was used for Chinese employees. Therefore, similar employees benefited more. For example, the income of a public servant in December increased by 52% compared with November, but the income of the heads of various departments in December increased by only 7% compared with November.

This Year's Shortfall is 20 Million Yuan

If the Bureau's income and expenditure situation continues in this way, the estimated deficit for this year will be around 20 million yuan, of which 12 million yuan is due to the increased allowance. Before the Bureau increased the allowance, the expenses were originally tight, and the annual deficit was only 2 million yuan. The revised method of restoring the long leave for foreign employees costs 3 million yuan per year. This expense was not listed in the budget for the previous year. In addition, the interest and principal repayment of public bonds are expected to increase by 1 million yuan compared with the previous year. In addition, the various items listed in the budget for the previous year that must be paid in foreign currency according to the contract were calculated at a rate of one yuan in national currency for four pence. The current exchange rate is lower, so this year's expenditure will cost 1 million yuan more. Based on the above reasons, the total deficit for this year is estimated to be around 20 million yuan. Therefore, the increase in contributions cannot be delayed. If it is delayed until April of this year, the amount of the previous increase will inevitably be larger. In addition, another benefit of convening a special taxpayers' meeting for taxpayers is that the Economic Committee's proposal to increase various license fees can take effect immediately.

Increased Contributions Can Barely Offset the Deficit

If municipal general donations and land taxes are levied at a rate of one percent, 1.4 million yuan can be obtained each year. Currently, the donation rate is 27%. After increasing the surcharge by 40%, an additional 15.12 million yuan can be collected each year. In addition, after the various license fees are revised, an additional 3.5 million yuan can be collected each year. In total, an additional 18.6 million yuan can be collected each year. To offset the above deficit, it is planned to increase the valuation of real estate to make up for the shortfall. As for the estimated deficit of 8.775 million yuan in the previous year, it is planned to temporarily transfer it to the temporary expenses item and then find a way to remedy it. What taxpayers are currently asked to pay is only enough for the Bureau to meet its various expenses for this year.

### Welcome Dr. Baker; Date Set; January 17th at the Hong Mian Restaurant; Second Batch of Wheat and Medicine to Arrive Soon

Dr. Baker, Director of the China Relief Division of the American Red Cross and Executive Director of the China International Famine Relief Commission, returned to the country last year and traveled in the United States to appeal for donations and raise 50 million yuan from the American people to relieve Chinese disaster victims. Later, he personally went to Free China to manage relief matters. His enthusiasm for relief is deeply appreciated by the Chinese people. This time, he came to Shanghai and stayed for two weeks before transferring to Chongqing via Hong Kong. More than ten charitable organizations, including the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Joint Charity Organization, the Jisheng Society, the China International Famine Relief Commission, and the Salvation Army, have specifically scheduled a welcome meeting at the Hong Mian Restaurant on Avenue Edward VII on the 17th of this month. At that time, in addition to expressing their gratitude to Dr. Baker, they will invite Dr. Baker to report on the situation of fundraising in the United States and his personal feelings after inspecting the rear area.

Second Batch of Wheat to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month

In addition to the 500 tons of rice and wheat transported to Shanghai by the Collinsworth Wheel on November 24th last year, the second batch of wheat, 1,000 tons, or 40,000 bags, will still be transported to Shanghai by the Collinsworth Wheel and is expected to arrive for distribution on February 5th. The wheat used to relieve the disaster areas of Su, Chang, Zhen, and Xi last year has been completely distributed. The wheat transported this time will also be used to relieve the disaster victims in the above-mentioned areas.

Large Batch of Medicine to be Shipped to China

As for the medicine, the first batch of 200 tons has been transferred to the mainland via Yangon and is being used by the China Relief Association and American hospitals. Only a small amount of quinine has arrived in Shanghai for distribution. It is now known that the second batch of medicine, 100,000 vitamin pills, is on the way and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 19th of this month.

### Hong Kong Restricts Entry; Alternative Measures

The population import restriction issued by the Hong Kong authorities will be implemented on the 14th of this month, next Monday. Shanghai merchants have close ties with Hong Kong. After the implementation of this restriction, the round trip between Shanghai and Hong Kong will be very inconvenient for merchants and travelers. Yesterday, the shipping industry in Shanghai received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that an alternative measure has been obtained for passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong. All passengers traveling to Hong Kong must pay 100 Hong Kong dollars to the shipping company, which will be transferred to the Hong Kong authorities for inspection. After verification, they will be allowed to land. Therefore, the Zhi Zha Li Jia Wheel of the Zha Hua Postal Shipping Company, which was originally scheduled to sail to Hong Kong on the 10th of this month in order to arrive in Hong Kong before the 14th, was announced by the company yesterday to be postponed to the 11th to sail to Hong Kong. At that time, passengers did not understand the truth and were dissatisfied. After the company informed them that the Hong Kong authorities had a temporary accommodation measure, the matter was resolved. As for the Jiangsu Wheel of Taikoo Company and the Minsheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson, they had already left Shanghai for Hong Kong the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the Suzhou Wheel of Taikoo Company also sailed to Hong Kong, because they had not yet received the news of the Hong Kong authorities' alternative measures and were all rushing to Hong Kong in advance.

### Rotary Club Regular Meeting Today

The Shanghai Rotary Club will hold its regular meeting today (time and address as usual).

If you need to reserve a seat, please call the club secretary (16450) before 10:30 this morning.

### China Central Telegraph Company Discovers Bomb

The Shanghai Times reported that at 11:00 a.m. yesterday (7th), a bomb was found in the vent of the China Central Telegraph Company at 70 Fuzhou Road. It is said to be a hand grenade and was discovered by an employee. He immediately reported it to the Public Works Department Police Department for investigation. No clues have been found as of the night. It is understood that the China Central Telegraph Company was established after the Japanese occupied it and sends and receives telegrams from the occupied areas. Its building is currently under renovation.

### Norwegian Residents in Shanghai Raise Funds for the Norwegian Aircraft Fund; Over 10,000 Volunteers Trained in Canada; Air Force Established with Funds Donated from Various Places

Since Norway was occupied, the national spirit has become more and more激昂, and the righteous deeds of national restoration have been actively launched. The Norwegian expatriates in various places have never forgotten their motherland. It is learned that Mr. Nordenson, the Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai, has launched a fundraising campaign to purchase aircraft and donate them for the use of the motherland's army. It is named the "Norwegian Aircraft Fund." Mr. Nordenson also earnestly appealed to the expatriates in Shanghai and friendly countries. If there are donations, they can be sent to the Norwegian Consulate at 2 Beijing Road. The Norwegian military authorities are currently training volunteer troops in Canada, numbering more than 10,000 people. Once the training is completed and they pass the examination, they will be transferred to the front line for combat. A part of them will establish an air force. The aircraft they use will be donated by expatriates from various places. The headquarters for fundraising was established in London not long ago, and branches were established in important cities around the world. The one launched by the Norwegian Consulate is one of them. The London headquarters has currently received a large number of donations from various places. Durban, South Africa, has already donated 5,000 pounds, which is enough to buy a Spitfire aircraft. The Shanghai Norwegian Consulate hopes that all expatriates in Shanghai and sailors in China, as well as sympathetic people from friendly countries, will enthusiastically donate to raise funds to purchase aircraft and strengthen the forces fighting for justice.

### Female Worker Unwilling to Live with Husband; Tragically Stabbed to Death by Husband; Murderer Arrested and Awaiting Sentence

Xu Senlan, the owner of the Xu Jinxiang cigarette paper shop at No. 202, Lane 134, Taopeng Road, Hongkou, and a native of Ningbo, lived with his wife, Ms. Chen, in the shop. They had a daughter named Juandi, who is now 26 years old. Since she was a child of seven, she was betrothed to Yu Changkang (now 30 years old), a fellow villager, as his wife, and she went to his house to be raised as a child bride. They married in 1932 and lived together at No. 29, Lane 770, Huade Road. Yu used to be a fishmonger and also worked as a rice master at the Public Welfare Charity Hall at No. 4, Xinkang Lane, Yangzhou Road. Recently, the relationship between Yu and his wife deteriorated and became like ice and charcoal. In addition to working as a female worker at Huasheng Cigarette Company, Juandi also returned to Ningbo in a fit of anger in August last year. Yu repeatedly tried to persuade her to return, but she refused. So, at about 8:00 p.m. on September 8th last year, she hid a sharp knife and suddenly went to her parents' house. When she failed to persuade his wife to go home, she took out the sharp knife and stabbed her violently, causing about 20 injuries all over her body. The most serious was a knife wound in her left chest, which was about an inch deep, causing blood to gush out like a spring. She fell to the ground. Her father, Xu Senlan, tried to dissuade him from the middle, and his left arm was also stabbed. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Yu abandoned the knife and fled without a trace. It was reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to send Juandi and others to Hudong Hospital. However, Juandi was too seriously injured and died on the way. Her body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. At the same time, a wanted warrant was signed by the First Special Court to order her arrest. It was not until the day before yesterday that Chinese detective Huang Yufu learned that Yu Changkang was eating a wedding banquet at the Daji Building Restaurant at No. 55 Xidou Road. He then joined forces with detectives from the French Concession Police Department to arrest Yu and bring him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, prosecuted him for murder. When interrogated, Yu Changkang confessed that after his wife returned to her parents' house, he repeatedly tried to persuade her to return, but she refused and wanted to divorce him. He suddenly recalled that Juandi had repeatedly talked and drank soda with a man named Han Maoxiang. And one day, his mother-in-law and four others invited him to a teahouse on Fenzhou Road, showed him a divorce agreement, and forced him to sign it, which he refused. Unable to bear it, he bought a knife and stabbed her three times, etc. Judge Liu ruled that the defendant be detained pending a scheduled sentence.

### Pitifully Beautiful Western Woman Dies Destitute; Many People Were Enamored Ten Years Ago; Frozen to Death on the Street Ten Years Later

The Shanghai Times reported that at dawn on the 4th of this month, the weather suddenly turned cold. A Western woman's body was found on the sidewalk in front of No. 662 Huade Road. She had already been frozen stiff. The woman was quite old, with wrinkles all over her forehead. She was wearing a dark green shirt, stockings, and Chinese-style shoes, which were tattered and unbearable, indicating that the woman had died due to poverty. However, the police could only estimate that the woman was about forty years old and five feet three inches tall, but there was no concrete clue to identify her name. Therefore, her body was taken to the public coroner's office for examination. At the same time, the public was asked to cooperate and visit the relatives and friends of the deceased in order to identify her name. After two days, there were no results. So, the last resort was used to examine her fingerprints. It was determined that the woman's name was "Tonia" and she was probably White Russian. According to the fingerprint department of the Police Department, "Tonia" was famous in Shanghai's nighttime entertainment venues ten years ago for her beauty and liveliness. There were many people who were enamored with her. However, her charm faded easily, and she became addicted to alcohol. A few years ago, she was sued in the Special District Court for causing trouble while drunk. In recent years, she became destitute and homeless. She had no one to turn to for help and finally died of cold and hunger on the roadside.

### Mother's Part in the Parricide Case; High Court Remands for Retrial

The sensational case of the rebellious sons Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang killing their biological father Zhou Yongjie and dismembering the body in an attempt to destroy the evidence was sentenced in the first instance to Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang to death, and their mother, Zhou Jing, to two years and six months in prison for helping to destroy the body. Subsequently, the defendants were dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. As a result, the case was rejected. The three defendants were still unwilling to accept the decision and hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, Yang Sicheng, Jiang Pingfan, and Jiang Baoli to appeal to the Supreme Court. Their appeal briefs contained tens of thousands of words. After the investigation by the Special Court Branch of the Supreme Court was concluded, it was ruled a few days ago that the appeal of Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang was rejected, and the original death sentence was maintained. As for Zhou Jing's part, there are still doubts, and it was remanded to the Second Branch of the High Court for retrial. The death sentence of the two rebellious sons has been confirmed.

### Madame Hua's 60th Birthday

Yesterday was the 60th birthday of Madame Hua, the mother of Dr. Su Zengfu, a pediatrician. Dr. Su's friends and students from various medical schools, because of Dr. Su's service to patients and his contributions to society, specifically initiated a birthday celebration for Madame Hua at the Dadong Restaurant. More than 100 Shanghai celebrities, including Lu Deng, Yuan Liang, Yan Yutang, Yu Danhan, Li Zhongqian, and Yan Duhe, attended, making it a grand occasion for a time. In the longevity hall, there were also calligraphy works by Mr. Yi Ran, the father of Ms. Zeng Xiang, and her late sister, Ms. Zeng Mei, which were full of dazzling beauty and were used as a memorial.

### To a Mother Who Works as a Singer

— Editor

Not long ago, Free Talk published an article by Ms. Hua Ping, "My Mother is a Singer," which attracted the attention and response of many readers at the time. One of the readers advised Ms. Hua Ping to "choose a good husband in the future." Coincidentally, Ms. Hua Ping also sent a manuscript of "My Pre-Marriage Commandments." We feel that her views are quite correct and can be used as a reference for unmarried women in society in general. Therefore, we are publishing it here.

We believe that Ms. Hua Ping's mother had to work as a singer to make a living due to the oppression of society and the environment, which is an unfortunate and sympathetic thing. And her spirit of fighting for 14 years to cultivate her daughter is worthy of admiration. It's just that singers are products of a deformed society and are entertainment tools for the leisure class. It cannot be said that it is a work that contributes to society. Therefore, we hope that Ms. Hua Ping's mother, like every awakened singer, dancer, and guide girl, will have the ability to uplift herself and seek a bright and proper way out, so as to have a good influence on her family and society.

We know that in this society full of thorns, the resistance to proper women's occupations is very great. We also know that in today's society where women's social status has not yet been stabilized, it is a difficult and heavy task for women to be active in society, but we don't have to be discouraged by this. We don't hope for any miracles to happen. We just need to have the spirit of taking one step forward and these obstacles to women's occupations will one day collapse.

### My Pre-marital Admonitions

— Hua Ping

Age increases with experience. Yesterday, when Mom was talking about me to guests, I overheard the phrase, "She's of marriageable age now."

Marriage, yes, advocating for early marriage has become a common opinion in China. Daughters can't eat at their parents' home for a lifetime. Eighteen years old! Some, many women, are already mothers. Although they themselves are just children, they have already tasted the pain of childbirth and the trouble of breastfeeding. Fortunately, I, at eighteen, am still a maiden. In China, which advocates for early marriage, this cannot but make me secretly rejoice.

Among classmates, we often unintentionally talk about marriage. We are not afraid of marriage, although we don't exactly welcome it. However, women should eventually marry, and this is something that should inevitably happen. How many mothers are anxious about their daughters' marriages, how many daughters heard their mothers reveal their own marriage news yesterday. Yes, we should be prepared, this is precisely the time for us to choose a partner. Regarding marriage, I don't feel apprehensive, I have my plans, I have my admonitions.

First, I don't hope that my spouse is a perfect person, I just want him to be good enough, like myself. I'm not a superhuman, and I don't need him to be superior to everything. He just needs to be like an ordinary person, with ordinary strengths, and also ordinary weaknesses. I can't marry someone who is superior to me in everything.

Second, I won't marry a university diploma or a doctoral title, I want real knowledge, practical skills. I don't want his educational attainment to be many times more profound than mine. Being a PhD's wife is a facade of vanity, but a disparity in knowledge is a painful reality.

Third, I won't marry a car or a villa in the countryside. I don't need the comfort of life and lose true love. If I want to marry the owner of a car, I must first recognize whether the car owner meets the conditions to be my spouse.

Fourth, I can't marry a man with different interests. I like to write, I don't want him to not read newspapers or magazines; I like to stroll in the park, I don't want my spouse to only know cards and horse racing. Even if he loves me with sincerity, I cannot marry a man with different interests.

Fifth, I won't marry lofty fame, I want a healthy physique and true love. I don't want to be the wife of a sickly celebrity, serving by the bedside for life; nor can I marry some minister or bank president, busy with social engagements for life, without real enjoyment of life.

Finally, I won't rashly marry the person I want to marry. During the courtship period, no man doesn't try to cover up his shortcomings and show deep admiration and respect. But after marriage, he arbitrarily exposes his flaws. This is perhaps the origin of "marriage is the tomb of love." Rather than rushing to the divorce court after marriage, stirring up a huge wave of family unrest, and carving deep wounds in the heart, it is better to have lengthy consideration before marriage, until you deeply understand the other person's character.

Let us have a long period of preparation and careful selection before marriage. Let us shout out the slogan, "Marriage is the beginning of happiness."

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

"Childish!" Yu Kun said with a laugh, hurrying out to go on stage.

"Who's the adult?" Yuqin retorted him, but Yu Kun didn't hear it at all.

Yuqin himself has never not admitted that he is still a child, and sometimes he often plays all kinds of childish games with his fellow apprentices in the troupe, but the kind of aversion to men playing female roles hidden in his heart is growing day by day. Despite the fact that those teachers and fellow apprentices with bad intentions constantly try to make fun of him or deliberately treat him especially well, he only has disgust and hatred. He can restrain his childishness, keeping his face stern all day long like a rooster about to fight. Every time he takes the stage, hearing the lascivious cheers, he can't help but get angry; however, for three or four years, he has only been angry, not as scared as that fat man's roar. What this roar expresses is not just teasing and provocation, it simply wants to swallow him whole!

In recent days, these situations have constantly plagued Yuqin's nerves; although his understanding is still very naive, an unfavorable omen has been clearly revealed to him. Especially what happened this morning has further increased the melancholy in his heart.

"No, Mom just came, why should I think about her again?" His gaze slowly moved from the locust tree outside the window to Yu Hua's very delicate thin face, saying listlessly.

"Is it because of something the master told you just now that you're unhappy?" Yu Hua tilted his head, seeming to guess with great certainty.

This guess really hit the mark! This morning, after the entire class of more than ninety students finished practicing their skills in the yard as usual, the troupe leader, Master Song, suddenly walked up to Yuqin. A loyal, unlike a performer, purplish-red round face showed a very embarrassed expression, and he gently said to Yuqin: "Don't go back to your quarters, I have something to say to you!"

Yuqin couldn't help but be stunned for a moment, because he knew that if there was nothing major, the master would never talk to any student alone. He wondered if he had violated any rules? Zhao Yu Kun, who was covered in dust from falling, also turned his head in the crowd and stuck out his tongue, making a face that was even uglier than crying.

This is the specialty of our little clown. Whenever he makes this face, Yuqin and any classmate can't help but laugh; but today Yuqin can't laugh, he has to hold a heart that is very uneasy, and follow his master slowly into the back. (Four)

### The Story of Hoarding

— San Bing

I, who was worried about the high price of rice, saw the following story. Now I write it down, hoping that the pot-bellied bosses will sober up and be vigilant.

During the Song Dynasty, in the Kaifeng area, there was a wealthy man named Qin. Because he was stingy, people called him Qin Skinflint. He relied on his good calculation skills to earn a fortune. But people are never satisfied. Having a thousand, they still want ten thousand. So, they often buy cheap and sell dear, hoarding and speculating, hoping to profit. This year, his family had one thousand dan of rice stored, waiting for an opportunity to reap extra profits. The opportunity came. This autumn, there was a drought, with barren land stretching for thousands of miles, and no grain harvested. Grain prices soared step by step, and refugees in the disaster area were starving. Some people advised Qin Skinflint to sell his stored grain to stabilize the market price, and to provide some relief. Qin Skinflint grinned and said, "Such a disastrous year is rare in a lifetime. Now I happen to encounter it, how can I easily let it go? I must wait until the rice price is as high as it can be, and then sell it. At that time, I can become a great wealthy man."

Qin Skinflint was single-minded in becoming a great wealthy man, hoarding rice and not selling it. Tens of thousands of poor people starved to death, but his heart did not move. After half a year, the situation became even more serious. A group of desperate refugees from Shandong arrived in Kaifeng. Hearing that Qin Skinflint's family was hoarding rice, they robbed him first. They rushed into the door, and happened to run into Qin Skinflint coming out to stop them, so they killed him with a single knife. The rice was then distributed to the refugees. The local people all said, "Such an unconscionable person, suffering this fate, truly the mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly small!"

### After Seeing "Red Powdered Faces and Golden Spears"

— Wang Zhi

Golden Star was established last year. Not long after its founding, it has indeed achieved the point of "strict production" in terms of its released works. At a time when yellow films were emerging, Golden Star produced more serious films with a stern attitude. This has had a good impact on the entire film industry, striving for the rise of fashion films and helping works with content and form become increasingly robust. These should not be accidental.

Although "Red Powdered Faces and Golden Spears" is also a period drama and a folk tale, the difference is that it has been adapted and abandoned.

In terms of form, "Red Powdered Faces and Golden Spears" is a period drama, but the advantage of historical dramas is that they provide new content through old forms, and being good at adaptation can further enhance the irony.

As for folk tales, it's not that they can't be filmed, but it depends on how they are filmed. Wu Yonggang brought Feng Menglong's story to the screen, but he completely overcame its existing shortcomings. This effort is worth noting by some directors.

In terms of directing techniques, there are flexible performances, and although the creation of atmosphere is not yet fully utilized, at least the connection is very clever. The director's control of actors and audience emotions is also successful.

In the beginning of the year of sweeping away yellow films, this gift from Golden Star is something that every lover of domestic films should sincerely accept.

### Erich Maria Remarque, Author of "All Quiet on the Western Front," in Hollywood

— Bei Li

Ten years ago, the film "All Quiet on the Western Front," which caused a sensation in the film industry, laid a solid foundation for the protagonist Lew Ayres in Hollywood, but now he is only filming MGM's "Call Dr. Kildare" series. At the same time, this film also made the name of the original author Erich Maria Remarque immediately famous. His work is considered a masterpiece of anti-war novels in the world literary scene.

Remarque was expelled by the German authorities for this reason, and has been wandering abroad for nearly twenty years. He recently visited Hollywood for a short-term investigation, and was warmly welcomed by all parties, becoming the most prominent person in Hollywood social circles.

In Hollywood, Remarque not only often spends time with his German friend Marlene Dietrich, but also maintains contact with the United Artists company, because his recent work Flotsam (literally translated as goods floating in the sea) is being made into a movie by them, directed by the famous John Cromwell, who has directed "Of Human Bondage" and "Abe Lincoln in Illinois".

Remarque does not plan to live in Hollywood for a long time, but in order to thank all parties for their warm concern and expectations, he will write various anti-war and exposé film scripts about the inside story of Germany for various film companies.

The maid said, "We asked him, but he wouldn't say his name directly. He seemed to say his surname was 'Shi'." As soon as Liu Rushi heard that the uninvited guest's surname was Shi, she felt a sudden stirring of old memories. She nodded and said, "Why is that man so persistently unclear? I have no choice but to see him. You can first lead him to the inner study and have him sit down and treat him well." The maid readily agreed and went downstairs. Liu Rushi put down her book, stood up in her delicate body, changed her outer garment, and gracefully went downstairs. When she arrived outside the inner study, she saw that there were several male and female servants standing there to wait. Liu Rushi waved her hand and said, "There's no need for so many people to stand guard, only the maid Bitao is needed here, the rest can retreat and wait for my call." The family members agreed and retreated. Liu Rushi lifted the curtain and entered, and saw a burly man with a curly beard sitting cross-legged on the kang, drinking a cup of tea. Who else could it be but Shi Da, whom she met by the Rainbow Pavilion in the past? Although his appearance has not changed much, his face is full of dust, and a state of frustration can be generally seen. As soon as Shi Da saw Liu Rushi, he quickly put down his teacup, jumped up, bowed to her, and said, "Madame Liu, how have you been since we last met? Do you still recognize the Iron Beggar from back then?" Liu Rushi smiled slightly and said, "How could I not recognize the brave man? It's been many years since we last met, and I often remember you. I don't know where the brave man has been all this time? Where did you come from? Please sit down and tell me." Shi Da thanked her and sat sideways on the kang. Liu Rushi sat on a brocade stool next to him. Shi Da sighed again and said, "I am grateful for the kindness and care of Madame Liu and Huang Gong in the past. The friendship of wearing clothes together will never be forgotten. After receiving a letter from the young master of the Jinling Marquis, I went to serve under Ning Nanhou, and I also wore armor and held a spear to kill bandits. Later, because Ning Nanhou was tyrannical and arrogant, and his wild nature was difficult to tame, I left him and went to another place. I once followed General Huang Degong to resist the barbarians. Unfortunately, Degong died in battle, so I wandered in Jiangnan and became an Iron Beggar again. Some old comrades invited me to join the Qing army to make contributions, but I vowed not to serve foreigners and harm my compatriots, so I would rather starve to death than go there. Later, I drifted to the Zhoushan Islands, and suddenly met..." (30)

### Maxims for Self-Cultivation (Six)

When there are many things to do, one complains of being too busy; when there are few things to do, one complains of being too idle. Being busy is not good, and being idle is not good, so how is it good? I tell you, when things are busy, you must know how to arrange them. If you arrange them properly, you won't be chaotic even when you're busy; when there are few things to do, you must know how to find things to do. If you can find things to do, you will never be idle!

### "Confucius" to be Rerun at Golden Capital Later Tonight

The box office success of Min Hua's "Confucius" at Golden City can be said to have exceeded people's expectations, but because Golden City had an agreement with Golden Star in advance, it finally gave up this New Year's Eve to "Red Powdered Faces and Golden Spears" on the evening of the 31st of last year. However, the owner of Golden City promised that after "Romance of the Western Chamber" had finished its run at the newly opened Golden Capital, "Confucius" would continue to be rerun in this new theater. This news has been recorded in the newspaper. Now it is known that it has been decided to rerun it on the evening of the 11th. Audiences who have not seen "Confucius" last time, do not miss this last opportunity, because Min Hua once stated that "Confucius" will no longer be shown in second-run theaters.
