### The Beginning of the Year of Victory: Frequent Reports of Triumph from Suiyuan West and Henan North; Chinese Troops Recapture Important Strongholds Southeast of Wuyuan; Northwest of Qinyang, Forces Enter Tai and the School Commandant's Camp

A certain area of Suiyuan: After days of courageous counter-attacks by Chinese troops against the Japanese troops occupying Xifangyingzi, across from Ma Qidu Ferry, southeast of Wuyuan, the area was completely recaptured in one day. The remaining Japanese troops fled east. After the defeated Japanese troops who invaded the vital Yellow River retreated, Chinese troops are currently still in pursuit. (5th Dispatch)

Chongqing: Late on the 31st, Chinese troops launched a fierce attack on Tai, the School Commandant's Camp, and other locations northwest of Qinyang. Chinese troops fought valiantly in close combat, and by 1:00 AM on the 1st, they had captured the two strongholds of Bang Tai and the School Commandant's Camp. In this battle, over 400 Japanese soldiers were killed, 2 officers and 92 soldiers were captured, and over 200 machine guns and rifles, as well as a large amount of military supplies, were seized. (5th Dispatch)

Hong Kong: Various towns in the Dongjiang area, as well as the counties of Huizhou, Boluo, Haiyan, Lufeng, and Bao'an, have recently been subjected to fierce bombing by Japanese aircraft, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries and significant losses, leaving them in a semi-desolate state. In addition to dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns, Japanese aircraft also dropped a large number of leaflets to threaten another advance on northern Guangdong. It is claimed that the bombing will continue. A mixed Japanese brigade near Shantou is reportedly active and plans to converge with another column advancing from Zengcheng to attack northern Guangdong, a strategy largely the same as that adopted on New Year's Day last year. There are currently about 12,000 Japanese troops southwest of Zengcheng, and 4,000 Japanese troops in Dongguan, who are reportedly being transferred to Zengcheng to participate in the northern attack. There are also reportedly 10,000 Japanese troops concentrated in Conghua and Huaxian. The high command of the Chinese troops in Shaoguan has not been able to determine whether the Japanese intend to attack northern Guangdong for a third time, only stating that they are prepared to deal with any eventuality. It is also possible that the Japanese, considering the Chinese troops transferred from Guilin to the Xijiang area and Wengyuan, are preparing to take a defensive posture. (5th International News Agency Dispatch)

### Welcoming a New Epoch-Making Year

— Sun Ke

President Sun's article analyzes the international relations between China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan, and determines that the thirtieth year of the Republic of China will mark a new era in Chinese and Pacific history. This new era will be the final victory of China's war against Japan and the thorough resolution of the Pacific issue. Based on reason, the current situation, and history, it is concise, insightful, and thought-provoking. Due to delayed mailing, it is being published as a supplement.

Today is the auspicious day of the first day of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, and it is also the time when the outcome of our war against Japan has been largely determined. According to our prediction, the thirtieth year of the Republic of China will mark a new era in Chinese and Pacific history. This new era will be the final victory of China's war against Japan and the thorough resolution of the Pacific issue.

Only after China's final victory in the war can the Pacific issue be reasonably resolved. This is inevitable due to reason, the current situation, and history, and we firmly believe it. The so-called Pacific issue is actually the problem caused by Japan's sole control over East Asia.

In the past, after the Meiji Restoration in Japan (1868), Japan imitated Europe and the United States, striving for wealth and power, while China declined due to the昏庸昏庸and corruption of the Qing court. Korea, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands were successively annexed by Japan, and the Manchurian Qing was unable to resist. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Japan continued to fight and defeat Imperial Russia in 1905. At that time, the international balance of power in the Pacific was broken, and Japan's plot to subjugate us became even more urgent. During the First World War, Japan presented Yuan Shikai with the Twenty-One Demands, fully exposing its aggressive ambitions. The Washington Conference and the Nine-Power Treaty were intended to restrain Japan, and although their effect was seen for a time, Japan increasingly sought ways to exclusively occupy China. Two years later, the Tanaka Cabinet was formed, secretly playing the "Positive Policy for Manchuria and Mongolia," openly taking the conquest of China as the foundation for conquering the world. The following year, the "May 30th" Incident occurred, and two years later, the "September 18th" Incident saw Japan occupy the three northeastern provinces. Five years later, the "July 7th" Incident broke out, completely destroying the overall situation in the Pacific. From this perspective, none of the so-called Pacific issues in the past century have not centered on Japan's attempt to dominate. Therefore, to solve the Pacific issue, we must seek the root cause to be effective.

What is the root cause? China's rise to fight and seek final victory. Tracing back to "July 7th," in order to maintain national independence, the survival of the people, and to restore peace in the Pacific, our country, based on the great guidance of the Three Principles of the People and the inspiring leadership, launched a long-term national war on "August 13th." The Shanghai battle lasted for three months, and the arrogance of the Japanese army was thwarted. The capital fell, but we did not accept a treaty of surrender. The transfer to Wuhan put the Japanese army in a quagmire, unable to extricate themselves. After three years of stalemate, Japan spent a huge 6 billion yuan in war expenses and suffered 1.5 to 1.6 million casualties, yet the Japanese army's predicament has not been slightly alleviated. Countries around the world have changed their psychology of fearing Japan and shifted their gaze to the revival of the Chinese nation. As the European war ended in France's defeat, the Japanese army was eager to capitalize on the opportunity to advance southward, and their efforts became increasingly dispersed. With the Tripartite Pact, the United States and Britain joined forces to aid us, and the situation of restraining Japan was formed. Recently, Japan's attempts to woo the Soviet Union have failed, and with no way to seek peace, they are playing old tricks in confusion and desperation, signing "private agreements."

Looking back at our country, it is the opposite of Japan. Internally, military, political, and economic affairs have all made significant progress. The will of the people in both the front and rear to fight to the end has become increasingly firm as the war continues. Everyone takes defending the country and sacrificing one's own life to maintain the life of the nation as their duty. The national spirit, which has been latent for thousands of years, is becoming increasingly clear, and the common belief in the Three Principles of the People is becoming more and more steadfast. Externally, international sympathy and assistance have become increasingly active due to changes in the international situation. After the Tripartite Pact, the United States not only was not intimidated by Japan's empty threats, but its steps to aid us in restraining Japan have become more practical and active. The strengthening of military preparations, the enhancement of national defense, and the success of diplomacy are all aimed at restraining Japan by using Japan itself. The continuation of lending us 100 million US dollars is a direct indication of active assistance. Since the reopening of the Burma Road, Britain's Far East policy and actions have been completely consistent with those of the United States. As for the Soviet Union, it has always adhered to its consistent stance of aiding us, puncturing the Japanese poison plan of drawing us in. The other nations surrounding the Pacific are all looking forward to China's early victory. The current international situation in the Far East is more favorable to us than it has been in the past three years. If Japan advances further south, the United States and Britain will inevitably give it a substantial blow. This is the inevitable trend of events.

Such a timely opportunity is a once-in-a-thousand-year chance. We should switch from defensive to offensive warfare, and the day of final victory will surely come before our eyes, and the Pacific issue will be resolved easily. I hope that our compatriots will be mindful of the gravity of our responsibility, unite as one, and align our steps to welcome this new era of victory in warfare and national revival. I offer my sincere prayers!

### Wu Kaixian Speaks: "Welcoming the Year of Victory"

Chongqing: At 6:30 this afternoon, the International Broadcasting Station invited Wu Kaixian, Deputy Minister of the Central Organization Department, to speak to the Shanghai community in his familiar local dialect, titled "Welcoming the Year of Victory." The full text is as follows: Elders and compatriots of Shanghai, today is the fourth day of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China. Although it has been three days since New Year's Day, I must still wish you a happy new year. Before the war, I had a close working relationship with you. After the war broke out, although I left Shanghai for a time, in the last year and a half, I have resumed my past relationship with you. Therefore, my New Year's greetings to you today are particularly heartfelt, because I have not only heard but also witnessed that since the National Army withdrew from Shanghai three and a half years ago, you in this so-called "isolated island" of Shanghai have stood up to fight in a harsh environment to support national policies, support the leader, preserve your personal integrity, and preserve the righteousness of the nation. You have not been cowed by power or lured by profit. Your spirit can truly move heaven and earth. Whenever I reported these touching and inspiring facts of your struggle to people in the rear, they all expressed great respect for you. Therefore, today I not only want to wish you a happy new year, but also represent the people in the rear to pay tribute to you. Because you live on an isolated island, your patriotic feelings are particularly strong, and your expectations for the final victory are even more eager. Now I can tell you some good news, that the thirtieth year of the Republic of China will be our year of victory in the war. This is not just our subjective hope, but an objective fact. Mr. Du Yuesheng has already told you a few days ago about the current military, financial, and international environment of China, and the central leaders spoke in particular detail in their New Year's Day report to our national compatriots. I think you all know these situations, and I don't want to waste your precious time repeating them. I would like to summarize by saying that since we started the war, whether in military, financial, or international environment, we have never been more favorable than we are now.

Editorial

### Prospects for the Far Eastern Situation

1941 is a year of reckoning, a year of victory. This is the belief shared by the vast majority of humanity in the world. In the Far East, its form and significance are expressed even more profoundly and clearly. Tracing back to the September 18th Incident ten years ago, which shattered the security and balance of the Pacific, the overall situation in the Far East entered a state of dimness and darkness step by step; reason and justice, life and property, all suffered unprecedented disasters. China's solitary struggle was directly aimed at completing its own great cause of resisting aggression and building the nation, and indirectly aimed at restoring the original security and order; however, it was burdened by the overall international situation, which was reversing at the time, and failed to obtain sufficient encouragement and support from the world's powers to quickly achieve its full success. It was not until the autumn and winter of last year, when the global situation reached a turning point, that the world recognized the great significance of China's independent support of this precarious situation; and the aggressors who intended to take advantage of others' difficulties in order to achieve their greedy desires were also unable to escape the clear division of the international community. From then on, the Far Eastern crisis of nearly ten years reached a new turning point: China received the benefit of gaining abundant assistance, while Japan approached the point of self-destruction due to injustice. Therefore, everything such as the unprecedented strength of the United States' Far East policy and aid to China, the gradual convergence of British and American positions on the Far East, and even the frustration of Germany's attempt to attack Britain and the defeat of Italy's war against Britain and Greece, played a significant positive or negative role in the evolution of the Far Eastern situation. The shadow of the past decade has only recently revealed a new dawn. Whether in politics, military affairs, economics, or diplomacy, the excellent situation of those who oppose aggression is in stark contrast to the stretched resources of the aggressors, which is infinitely gratifying. From this, it can be seen that the so-called alternating rise and fall, the reversal of extremes, originally seemed to be a deduction within the realm of philosophy, but now, experiencing it in reality, it is also seen to be an unchanging truth.

The New Year's addresses of officials from various countries were all filled with optimistic self-confidence. For example, the communique of the Chinese leader exhorting the military and civilians to work hard to complete the great cause of nation-building was indeed inspiring. Even Nazi Germany, which was gradually entering a reverse, still made exaggerations of victory, which was still in keeping with the strong spirit of the Germanic people. Only Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's New Year's speech was hesitant and held a pessimistic tone. In comparison, although it cannot be immediately concluded as an empty and illusory confession, at the very least, it is a kind of sorrowful tone under distress and pressure. But on the other hand, whether his pessimistic view was still hoping for an improvement in US-Japan relations, or believed that US-Japan rapprochement had become hopeless, he still insisted on the old tune of his so-called "new order" and even "natural aspirations." In other words, the Japanese authorities, faced with various military and diplomatic failures, countless internal and external difficulties, and knowing that there was no possibility of success in the future, still lingered in the persistent dream of expansion and aggression. And the rumored spring offensive of the Axis powers, which has been circulating recently, is probably the last attempt the Japanese warlords are expecting. In fact, given the general trend, if any observer makes a clear forecast of future international trends, it is not difficult to recognize that the decline and disadvantage of the Axis powers cannot be reversed by a desperate gamble of reckless adventure. As for Japan and Germany and Italy, the former certainly hopes that the situation in the European war will favor Germany and Italy, so that the United States' attention will shift to the Atlantic; and the latter also hopes that Japan will launch something in the Pacific, in order to reduce American support for Britain. It is still difficult to predict how these mutually unverifiable wishes will be put together; however, the piracy that has recently been discovered in the Pacific is very likely to be regarded as a harbinger of the European war spreading to the Far East. However, in reality, although Japan possesses a strong naval force, it also has significant strategic and economic weaknesses. If it cannot extricate itself from the deep quagmire of China and plunder resources from China to make up for its losses, then even if the European situation becomes dangerous again, giving it a better opportunity to launch a southern advance, it will still be at the end of its rope and not enough to cause concern. President Roosevelt called China the great defense of the United States, and indicated that China would soon obtain more aid from the United States, which is precisely aimed at Japan's weakness. On this point, the effectiveness of China's future counter-offensive in stabilizing the Far East, even if it cannot be greater than the effect of the US fleet opening to the east, should be comparable to it.

After nearly ten years of darkness, thanks to China's own efforts to rise up and the help of international friends, the light is gradually approaching. However, before reaching smooth roads, we must still go through a very difficult process, as it is expected that the aggressors, unwilling to accept this defeat and decline, will try their last brutality. Although the fate arranged by history cannot be reversed by unwilling attempts, those who respond to their last attempt must make persistent efforts.

### U.S. Congress Reconvenes; Far East Issues to be Discussed; New Sino-American Stabilization Fund Agreement May Be Officially Signed Next Week

Washington. As the U.S. Congress reconvenes, it is generally believed that the Far East situation will be an important topic of discussion. The Far East situation will include consideration of German ships' piracy in the Pacific, major U.S. takeover of British Pacific routes, strengthening the Philippine fleet and its defenses, and discussion of China's request to utilize four hundred aircraft.

Washington. Republican Representative Douksen of Illinois announced yesterday that he will submit two draft bills to Congress, proposing to convert every U.S. merchant sailor into a naval reservist to defeat the current Communist control of U.S. shipping. He stated that he will submit a proposal next week "to make it effective during times of national defense crisis." President Roosevelt's proposed $300,000,000 shipbuilding program is bound to raise a serious question: whether the expanded fleet should continue to be harassed by spies. (Reuters, 5th) At their secret meeting, Washington Democratic Senators unanimously elected Senator from Kentucky to continue as the Senate's Democratic leader, and Senator Hill from Alabama as deputy leader. The Republicans elected Senator from Oregon, the defeated U.S. Vice President McNary, as the Senate's Republican leader.

U.S. and Philippine Authorities Plan Actively to Defend the Philippines

Manila. Reliable sources recently stated that, along with the increase in U.S. naval and ground forces in the Philippines, U.S. and Philippine military authorities are jointly planning a defense program for the Philippines to achieve the greatest possible preparedness. It is said that U.S. and Philippine military leaders are considering the great strides of U.S. national defense activities to establish the defense plan for the Philippines. It is reported that U.S. Army officers are investigating the training organization and mobilization teams of the Philippine military to determine the necessary equipment for arming the Philippine militia. It is said that this investigation is to facilitate the estimation of the funds necessary for mobilizing Philippine manpower during times of emergency. Currently, the trained Philippine regular army and reserves total twelve divisions, which, together with the 10,000 U.S. Army regulars and Philippine Scouts stationed in the Philippines, constitute the first line of the Philippine Army. News from Washington states that the U.S. will allocate US$50 million from the gold evaluation proceeds and sugar tax to be used for the defense of the Philippines. This news is warmly welcomed by national defense personnel. U.S. Army authorities and the Philippine government are said to agree with this approach. If this amount is paid to the Philippines, it will be used to procure equipment for the Philippine Army. While this amount is insufficient for the entire Philippine national defense, it can immediately enhance the defense capabilities of the Philippine Army. Some well-informed sources have learned that even after this US$50 million is exhausted, the defense equipment for the Philippine Army will still be insufficient, and the U.S. federal government may allocate additional funds. The annual defense expenditure of the Philippines is US$8 million, but it is reported that the defense expenditure for 1940 was only US$3.5 million. This may be because Philippine officials believe that since there is no sufficient armament, there is no need to train more personnel, and therefore defense expenditures can be reduced. Since the birth of the Republic of the Philippines in 1935, after training a group of young Filipinos, there has been little increase in the necessary equipment for a modern army. As for the Philippine air defense, it has only recently been strengthened due to the dispatch of two complete squadrons of aircraft to the island by the U.S. Army. The U.S. Army here now has eighty aircraft, sufficient for the first line of defense. The Navy has at least twenty-six long-range patrol bombers. The current U.S. naval presence in Philippine waters is stronger than at any time since the U.S. occupation of the Philippines. The Asiatic Fleet currently includes the cruisers "Cincinnati," "Houston," and "Marblehead," three destroyer squadrons, one aircraft carrier, six S-class submarines, and eighteen large submarines, of which twelve have recently arrived. The Philippines currently has no navy, but the Philippine Army has a patrol squadron consisting of two fast motor torpedo boats, called "Q" boats. In addition, a surface patrol reserve team has also been established, incorporating merchant marine officers and sailors into the national defense organization. The establishment of the surface patrol team and its reserves is the first step towards a naval organization for the Philippines. Major General Valdes, Chief of Staff of the Philippine Army, has announced the appointment of more than two hundred merchant marine officers and personnel to various groups in the surface patrol reserve team. This reserve force is the core of a future naval reserve, sufficient to provide any maritime convenience that the government can requisition in times of emergency. This reserve team, like the Philippine Army Reserve, must be rapidly mobilized at any necessary time. (Reuters, 5th)

### British Senior Military Officer Appointed as Military Attaché to China; Expected to Arrive in Chongqing in Mid-Month; This Move by the British is of Significant Importance

He will be accompanied by an assistant military attaché. This morning, the Central Daily News prominently carried this news, stating that it is the first time that the British government has appointed a senior military officer as military attaché to China, and this move is of great importance. A new building is currently under construction at the British Embassy's tennis court to serve as the officer's temporary office. In addition to Major General Dennis and the assistant attaché, the office staff includes Major Miller, Captain Baddoo, and Captain Perrier. (Reuters, 5th)

### Medical Clinics Established in Recovered Areas of Southern Guangxi

Nanning. A reporter visited the person in charge of the Guangxi Provincial Health Department today to inquire about the sanitary facilities in the recovered areas of southern Guangxi.

(3) The Nanning Provincial Hospital is being restored, and Zhang Zanyu has been appointed as the director. More than 100,000 yuan has been included in the provincial government's budget for the 30th year. (4th dispatch)

### Conscription Methods to Be Changed

Chongqing. Cheng Zerun, Director of the Military Service Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, stated that the conscription methods for this year will undergo several changes to adapt to the environment. For example, the originally scheduled monthly lottery for qualified conscripts will now be changed to once every three months. The government welcomes those who are not selected to volunteer. The previously established preferential treatment measures for the families of soldiers going to war will be strictly implemented. The required funds will be collected by those who do not contribute a conscript by paying one Sheng of grain per Mu or the equivalent in cash. Merchants will also pay according to this ratio. In addition, the funding for the National Army, which is outside the formal military service, has been secured, and all provinces will intensify training. Among them, Sichuan Province will have 4 million people, excluding those serving in the military, enrolled in the National Army for training. (Havas, 5th)

### Japanese Authorities in Beiping Refuse U.S. Protest; Negotiations Fail to Yield Results

According to reports, the commander of the U.S. sailors stationed in Beiping requested an apology from the Japanese side and reported the matter to the Washington government because the Japanese side detained and beat four U.S. soldiers and forced three U.S. soldiers to sign letters of repentance. (Reuters, 5th)

### Matsuoka Broadcasts to Japanese Nationals, Urges Them to Wage a War of Destruction

To Thoroughly Implement the So-Called New Order in Asia; This Ideal Requires Fifty Years to Realize

Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently broadcasted in Japanese to Japanese people around the world, saying that the ongoing destructive wars in the East and West are harbingers of future great construction work. According to translations received by foreign press circles, Matsuoka called on Japanese nationals overseas to cooperate with the government in order to achieve Japan's ideals. Matsuoka stated that Japan is engaged in the work of world peace and mutual prosperity, and predicted that Japan's ideals will be realized within fifty years. This broadcast, originating from Japanese radio stations, was broadcast to Japanese nationals in North and South America, Hawaii, China, and other countries. Matsuoka's remarks essentially reiterated his special New Year's Day speech, which has been criticized by Washington observers and members of Congress as being pessimistic and not intended to improve U.S.-Japan relations. While Matsuoka expressed hope that a new order of lasting peace could be built in the New Year, he also issued a warning that this year would be the most pessimistic and unfortunate year for all mankind. However, Matsuoka also believed that after the current war ends and a new order is established, there will be a bright future. The violent and destructive wars currently being waged in the East and West are the prelude to future great construction work. The world war of the past twenty years, the recent Second European War, and the Chinese War are all struggles ultimately aimed at an unprecedented global transformation. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Rumor of German Troops Entering the Mediterranean; Situation in the Balkans Tense; Turkish Troops Concentrated on Border; Bulgaria May Intervene in the Italo-Greek War

Capital of Yugoslavia. Since receiving news yesterday that German troops will pass through Bulgaria to the Mediterranean, there has been great commotion here. Recent news, such as the arrival of several thousand German troops in Romania and the construction of fortifications in Romania facing Yugoslavia, coupled with Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov's recent trip to Vienna, has further convinced political figures that Germany is currently intending to do so. The German side here claims, "Germany will never allow Valona and Durazzo to become Italy's Dunkirk, and will therefore prevent Britain from gaining hegemony in the Mediterranean at any cost." Well-informed circles believe that if German troops do move towards Salonica, they can contain a portion of British ships in the Mediterranean, making it easier to attack Britain. Well-informed circles now also deeply believe that the Soviet Union will not act solely for the sake of the Balkans, but will act in its own interests. It is said that the movement of Soviet troops towards the Romanian border and the entry of German troops into Romania are merely coincidences. If such observations are correct, then Turkey is currently facing the danger of German troops obtaining Soviet consent to enter Salonica. The German terms of exchange with the Soviet Union are promises of territory and respect for Soviet interests in the Dardanelles. Therefore, the Soviet military preparations in the Black Sea are only to ensure that the Germans respect their promises. (Associated Press, 5th)

Rome. The powerful Roman newspaper Il Popolo di Roma hinted yesterday that other German troops could join the battle in the Mediterranean region soon. The Turin newspaper La Stampa claimed that the U.S.'s expansion of armaments is completely useless and is only a moral suicide, because the U.S. has no borders with the Axis powers and does not need to defend its borders. (Associated Press, 5th)

Budapest. The tense situation in the Balkans reached a new peak today, as news indicated that Bulgaria, incited by Germany, may soon intervene in the Italo-Greek war and aid the Axis powers. At the same time, Romania, which has been virtually completely taken over by the German "Model Army," suddenly stopped all telephone communications with foreign countries. Just as Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov was meeting with Nazi officials in Vienna, Bulgaria suddenly became the focus of attention. Diplomatic circles learned that Germany is putting pressure on King Boris of Bulgaria to allow German troops to pass through Bulgaria to Greece. At the same time, it is reported that Turkey is heavily concentrating reinforcements in the northwest region bordering Bulgaria and Thrace, apparently intending to take action. It is learned that Turkey has concentrated 800,000 troops, half of whom are assembled on the Thracian border. It is believed that the Soviet Union and Turkey are now putting counter-pressure on Romania to remain neutral. (International News Service, 5th)

Istanbul. It has been learned that a bill was proposed in the Turkish parliament last Friday stipulating that all young people currently undergoing the ordinary one-and-a-half-year military training should continue to receive another year of additional training. It is believed that Turkey can put on soldiers' uniforms another batch of men totaling approximately 2.5 million. Officials recently acknowledged that many men have been mobilized and that Turkey is currently in a state of "wartime preparedness." (Associated Press, 5th)

Ankara. According to news yesterday, Turkish army conscripts aged 21 and over will all remain in service for one year. This measure was decided by the Turkish government after a request from the General Staff, as it is considered necessary for national defense. (Reuters, 5th)

Cairo. A communiqué from the British military headquarters in Egypt stated that British troops continued to advance towards Bardia and have now captured 8,000 enemies. The battle is proceeding smoothly. (Reuters, 5th)

Cairo. Today's war report stated that this morning, the British Blitzkrieg corps, the Australian assault team, broke through the inner defensive line of Bardia. After capturing 8,000 Italian troops and occupying half of the fortresses around Bardia, the assault team launched continuous fierce attacks on the Italian inner defensive line, resulting in this battle achievement. It is estimated that the Italian garrison's deaths and captures have reached 40%. It is said that the Italian military resistance is rapidly weakening. According to unofficial news today, British naval and air forces fiercely attacked the Italian military last night, leaving them no chance to retreat. It is certain that Australian and New Zealand troops did enter Bardia. A headquarters communiqué stated, "Our forces are making smooth progress around Bardia. British naval eyewitnesses say that our forces bombarded fiercely yesterday, and the entire Bardia plateau has almost been completely destroyed." (International News Service, 5th)

Cairo. It is reported that yesterday British Royal troops, led by Australian troops, launched fierce attacks on the main defensive line of Bardia from all sides. Although the Italian defenders resisted fiercely, it gradually weakened. Therefore, the fall of Bardia is expected to be imminent. It is said that the Italian defenders' casualties and captures have been between one-quarter and one-third of the total number of soldiers. (International News Service, 5th)

Alexandria. On Friday, the British Mediterranean Fleet, together with the army, launched an extremely fierce bombardment of Bardia. Reporters on the battleship witnessed the fleet firing at least 300 tons of shells at coastal artillery positions, lasting for ninety minutes. The main task was to bombard the mechanized troops concentrated northwest of Bardia in order to prevent their counterattack or retreat. When the British fleet arrived off the coast of Bardia, the army had already opened fire for an hour. Soon after, reporters saw a continuous barrage of artillery fire, densely packed like a string of beads. The British ships, about 10,000 yards from the shore, fired their cannons in unison in calm winds, calm seas, and clear visibility. Dust and sand rose up, obscuring vision. The Italian artillery retaliated, but their aim was inaccurate, and then they fell silent. The British ships continued to bombard until dusk before stopping. (Reuters, 5th)

### British Bomber Squadrons Fiercely Attack the Port of Bremen; Dropping Tens of Thousands of Incendiary Bombs; German Planes Attack Britain Again the Night Before

London. In the week ending at dawn on January 3, British bomber squadrons attacked Bremen twice and the Lorient submarine base four times, as well as other port targets at least sixteen times. The targets attacked in Bremen included the naval base, the Atlas shipyard, the Deutsche Vacuum Oil refinery, railway lines, warehouses, rice mills, and the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory. Bremen is Germany's second largest port and a very important industrial area in Germany. It suffered a third night raid on Friday night, with flames lighting up the sky, as fierce as the first night raid. The first night raid lasted three and a half hours, dropping 20,000 incendiary bombs. It is believed that after this fierce attack on Bremen, war equipment production will be greatly reduced for a time. According to reports from aircrew who attacked on Friday night, there were 21 major fires within one mile of Bremen, with thick smoke rising up to 9,000 feet. Fires broke out throughout the city, uncountable. From above, Bremen looked very much like a Christmas fire tree. The battle on Friday night lasted three hours. The British planes had poor weather at the start of the flight, but the weather improved after reaching the Dutch coast. Later, factories and docks were hit one after another, and black smoke filled and obscured the entire city, so it was slightly difficult for British planes to identify targets. The bombs and incendiary bombs dropped by British planes were very destructive, and the debris of buildings flew high into the sky, which the aircrew were able to witness. One of the largest factories in the city was completely on fire, and the fire spread along the railway line to the river. At that time, the fire and smoke enveloped the city, and the aircrew could only see the entire city in flames and could not observe the details of the destruction. During this week, British planes flew to Emmerich and destroyed a bridge with bombs dropped from a height of 500 feet. They also flew to Egersund in Norway, destroying a German 4,000-ton supply ship and warehouses and wharves. They also flew to Vlissingen in Belgium, destroying a ship equipped with anti-aircraft guns. The Lorient submarine base was attacked four times last week, and the north dry dock, power plant, radio station, and warehouses were all hit by British planes. British planes lost seven planes in attacking targets in various parts of Germany. (Reuters, 5th)

### Rumor That Germany Has Requested of Vichy to Manage the Railways Through Italy; This Move Exceeds the Scope of the Armistice Treaty; The Attitude of the French Government Remains Ambiguous and Unclear

London. The rumor that the German side has requested the Vichy government to allow them to manage the Mont Cenis railway leading to Italy has aroused much concern in London. A Reuters diplomatic reporter heard from a certain important French figure that this rumor seems more credible. This railway has existed for 70 years and passes through a tunnel under the mountain for seven and a half miles, making it the most direct and fastest route between France and Italy. The railway's capacity to transport troops and ammunition is also quite significant, and it is often not hindered by winter rain and snow. If the Axis powers were to seize this railway, they would benefit greatly, because the only main railway between Germany and Italy through the Brenner Pass has been overburdened in the past few months. Italy lacks coal and raw materials, so Germany has to send trains to transport goods to Italy every day. However, vehicles entering Italy must return, making the long round trip time-consuming. Moreover, the slopes on both the Italian and Austrian sides of the Brenner Pass are very steep, and the trains move very slowly between them. If Germany is determined to actively aid Italy, it must have a second railway, and the most suitable one would be the Mont Cenis railway. This matter obviously exceeds the scope of the armistice agreement. It is not yet known whether the Vichy government is prepared to make this concession. The needs of the Axis powers will be an opportunity to test Vichy. However, Marshal Pétain, who has colonies and a fleet, and who is the focus of the French people's prestige, will be able to resist German pressure with great force. The situation in Vichy is still chaotic. The cabinet's position remains uncertain, except for the resignation of Baudouin, who was inclined towards the Fascists. According to recent news, the situation in Vichy does not disappoint Britain. (Reuters, 5th)

Vichy. The French cabinet held a meeting yesterday under the leadership of Admiral Darlan, which lasted for two and a half hours. Darlan stated that Franco-German relations have "slightly improved," but that there is no dangerous or tense situation. He also stated that negotiations between the two countries, which were suspended three weeks ago after the dismissal of Laval, can now resume. At the same time, according to the order of the government list delivered by the French government to the U.S. Embassy, French Prime Minister Pétain has further adjusted the political power. The list is ordered with Darlan as the first cabinet member, followed by Army Chief of Staff Huntziger and then Foreign Minister Flandin, followed by Justice Minister Alibert. Previously, Baudouin was the first cabinet member. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Business Circle Supports Legal Tender, Refuses to Accept Miscellaneous Currency

The "Reserve Bank" established by the Jiangning side is rumored to open today at 1 Zhongshan East Road and begin issuing "convertible notes". The issuance rights of "Huaxing" Commercial Bank will also be revoked from the same day. The Shanghai business community is paying close attention to whether the Jianghai Customs will accept the "Ning notes" afterward. However, the Jianghai Customs tax revenue has already been forcibly deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. If "Ning notes" are collected afterward, it can actually reduce the opportunity for the Japanese to use legal tender to purchase foreign exchange, which will not only not harm the monetary policy of the National Government, but may also benefit it. As for various industries refusing to accept miscellaneous currencies, they still adhere to their original intentions.

Loyalty Army Controls Nanjing Suburbs, Safely Withdraws After Completing Mission

According to people from Nanjing, a large detachment of the Chinese Loyalty National Salvation Army recently arrived in the suburbs of Nanjing, with considerable strength. They frequently attacked various agencies and transportation inside and outside the city. On December 8th of last year, they once stormed into Jiangpu County, catching the Japanese army and miscellaneous troops off guard, who hastily fled. All the self-proclaimed agencies were occupied, and they fought back and forth in the city. In addition to killing thirty to forty Japanese and miscellaneous soldiers, they also captured more than ten hired police officers. It is said that the army safely withdrew after completing its mission. It is reported that in this battle, a certain captain of the army led several soldiers to sneak into Jiangpu County in advance, posing as detectives to make contact. On December 7th, they launched an attack, and the army units scattered outside the city responded in unison, bravely rushing into the city, resulting in this victory.

Shanghai Municipal Council Values Elections, Council Elections Have Now Begun, Municipal Council Decides to Appoint Key Personnel to Handle

The Shanghai Municipal Council elections are only a little over three months away. Due to the Japanese side's continued attempts to increase the number of Japanese directors, this year's council elections will inevitably be more intense than last year. According to reliable sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rates Office has already begun to handle matters related to the election of council directors. It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities have decided that due to the intense competition in this election and the heavy workload, in addition to the entire Rates Office handling the election matters, they will also appoint senior Western officials from among the chief executives to assist in the handling, in order to show prudence.

Chiang Kai-shek's Personal Instruction, Thoroughly Investigate Price Gouging, Concession Authorities Send Personnel to Investigate Rice Reserves, Rice Brokers Should Continue to be Prohibited from Entering the Market

Since the military uprising, transportation in various places has been disrupted, and the transportation of essential goods has been difficult. Moreover, various places have successively become war zones, and the environment is special. General merchants take advantage of the opportunity to hoard goods and manipulate the market, doing everything possible. This is especially true for rice, which has led to the stimulation of various commodity prices, and the high cost of living is unprecedented. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from relevant sources in this city that the supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek, in order to thoroughly investigate food prices, crack down on hoarding, and protect the profits of legitimate businesses, has issued a personal instruction, ordering local administrative agencies to start suppressing rice prices and smoothing the source of rice. If anyone dares to disobey and deliberately hoard goods, the local authorities shall arrest them, conduct a trial, and handle the matter according to law. The relevant authorities in this city have received this notice and will inform the various rice industry groups to report the hoarding of rice truthfully, and will reward informants in order to stabilize the food supply in Shanghai.

Start Thoroughly Investigating Rice Reserves

The authorities of the two concessions are paying close attention to the increase or decrease of food allowances. In order to clarify the amount of rice reserves and use it as a reference for assisting the rice industry in price evaluation, they have dispatched special personnel to various rice warehouses to strictly investigate the quantity of rice, the date of storage, the place of origin, the price, and the name of the owner of the rice. If it is found that the rice has been stored for a long time without the intention of selling it, it is said that they will be ordered to reduce the price and release it from the warehouse, otherwise it will be confiscated and used for price stabilization.

National Rice Should Also Have Price Limits

Since rice trading returned to normal on the 3rd of this month, speculators have taken the opportunity to stir up trouble again. In the past few days, there have been unfounded rumors in the market, and they have flourished again, causing people to be uneasy and the market to be chaotic. Rice prices have been continuously pushed up, and national rice has even risen by two yuan, while foreign rice has also risen by more than fifty cents. The rice brokers are so rampant and unscrupulous, and severe punishment is absolutely necessary. Although the price of foreign rice has been re-evaluated and limited, the price of national rice should also be evaluated and limited to avoid the price of foreign rice from rising in response. Otherwise, the trading of national rice in the market should be prohibited. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.

Brokers Endanger the People's Food Supply

The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee was previously instructed by the concession authorities that the high price of rice and the chaotic market situation were greatly related to the illegal transactions of rice brokers. However, in order to prevent underground trading and illegal transactions, and to stabilize the entire food supply, it was decided to prohibit these rice brokers from entering the market for two weeks. After the meeting decided, it was announced and implemented on the 26th of last month. The two weeks have now passed on the 8th of this month, so rice brokers can return to the market from the 9th. However, the rice brokers are causing trouble in the market and endangering the people's food supply. These people have repeatedly engaged in illegal transactions in order to enrich their own pockets. It is hoped that the authorities will continue to prohibit these people from entering the market during this time of food panic.

Preferential Treatment for Group Purchase Members

The Shanghai Grain Cooperative Association has recruited more than 200 members. In order to reduce the burden of living, all members who purchase foreign rice will be given special preferential treatment. In addition to sending special personnel to deliver the purchased rice when it arrives at the port to avoid accidental losses, it has also been decided to reduce the amount of money collected in half before the rice arrives at the port. That is, for one to five bags, a deposit of 20 yuan per bag will be pre-collected. For six to twenty bags, a deposit of 30 yuan per bag will be collected. For more than twenty bags, a deposit of 45 yuan per bag will be pre-collected, in order to show preferential treatment.

Several American Missionaries Depart from Shanghai this Morning on the President Pierce

The American Postal Ship President Pierce of the American Postal Ship Company arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM via Manila and Hong Kong and docked at buoys 12 and 13. It carried 264 passengers, of whom 74 disembarked here, while the rest went to the United States or various ports along the way on the original ship. The ship brought 1,000 tons of cargo and 43 bags of mail. It left the port at 5:30 this morning, carrying some American missionaries and teachers from this port, taking the route through Japan and Honolulu to return to San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Pastor and Mrs. Meyer Died in Bombing, Eight Bombs Fell on Their Residence, Japanese Planes Must Have Been Deliberately Bombing

According to the Datong News, this office recently received a letter from Pastor Alton of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Association, stating the circumstances of the bombing of Pastor and Mrs. Meyer Holt of the South China Gospel Church in Guizhou (transliteration) by Japanese planes. A section of the letter is as follows: "On December 22, when Japanese planes bombed Guizhou, Pastor Meyer's residence was hit by bombs, and the couple were killed. According to a letter from Mr. Lee of the Chinese Christian Association on his way to Xiuzhou (transliteration), the situation of Pastor Meyer's residence being bombed was described, saying that the Japanese planes must have deliberately carried out indiscriminate bombing. Eight bombs fell on Pastor Meyer's residence, and one bomb hit the room where the couple were sheltering, causing both of them to die. At that time, there were no people from the Gospel Church nearby, so Hong Kong has sent Mr. Stanner to bury the benevolent Pastor and Mrs. Meyer, and to take care of the funeral arrangements and collect valuable relics and documents. Pastor Meyer was the acting chairman of the South China Gospel Church. Together with his wife, they always assisted travelers through the most difficult section of the Sha Yu Chung to Xiuzhou line. Travelers found it convenient. Now that the bad news has come, those who have benefited from them are all shocked and grieved."

Public Concession Tramways Will Not Increase Fares for the Time Being

After the British-owned tramway company submitted an application to the Shanghai Municipal Council in December of last year for approval to increase the fares of trams on various routes, it was originally scheduled to be implemented from January 1st of this year. According to reports from the Pingming News Agency to the company, it is said that although the increase in fares has been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the company authorities have not yet formulated a plan for increasing fares and need to consider it further before deciding on the implementation date. However, according to the opinions of the general public, public utilities should not be allowed to increase prices without restriction. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will give it careful consideration.

Three Bombs Found at the Intersection of Wangping Street and Hankou Road

At around 6:15 last night, someone suddenly placed a hand grenade wrapped in newspaper at the intersection of Wangping Street and Hankou Road. The upper end had a wooden handle exposed, and the lower end was tied with a copper ring. Fortunately, it was discovered by the concierge of this newspaper, who immediately summoned his companions to come and investigate the surroundings. Then, two more hand grenades of the same type were discovered under the steps of the Dachangyuan Paper Shop across the street and under the telegraph pole at the corner of the Foreign Cemetery. Fortunately, none of them exploded, so there was no damage. The concierge immediately reported the information to the Central Police Station, and several Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched in police cars to investigate. Then, the three hand grenades were taken back to the police station for investigation. Afterward, many police officers were deployed at the intersection of Wangping Street and Hankou Road to strictly defend and search, but nothing was found.

The Shanghai Tongren Association received a telegram from a Hong Kong representative yesterday, reporting that General Manager Wang replied that the conditions proposed were too different from the management's intentions. The staff has scheduled an emergency meeting for this morning to discuss countermeasures and express their determination. The management is also trying its best to find a solution.

More than 300 engineers from more than 100 electrical machinery knitting factories have submitted requests to the factory owners for increased living allowances and improved treatment through the Federation. All conditions have been completely revised and approved, but the factory owners have not signed, which has caused dissatisfaction among all the engineers. The factory owners have agreed to invite the political department of the Concession authorities to negotiate today.

This ship carries 100,000 bags of rice to Shanghai each time it travels between Saigon and Shanghai, which is especially needed by the Chinese people in this city.

Do Not Use Agency Envelopes for Letters Sent Abroad

Postal Headquarters Instructions for returning those who do not comply with regulations: Letters sent abroad must be forwarded through Vietnam. Recently, due to the special circumstances in that area, in order to avoid illegal inspection and detention, the place of dispatch cannot use the name of the agency, army serial number, or special representative mailbox. If the nature of the letter is important, it should follow government regulations and change to airmail directly to Hong Kong or Yangon for forwarding, and indicate this forwarding route on the envelope to show caution. All letters that do not comply with the regulations will be returned by the Kunming Administration for a new envelope to be sent again.

How China Can Wage a Protracted War (3) by Hu Shih

These and other similar questions, I believe, you have often heard people ask in recent years, especially in the last thirteen months since the outbreak of the European War. Here I will use the remaining time to explain why China cannot and is unwilling to give up fighting.

First, China cannot give up fighting now because giving up fighting is tantamount to complete surrender, sacrificing the independence and freedom for which we have fought for forty months. The best lesson for China is the surrender of France. China does not want to suffer the same fate as France is now.

Two years ago, I gave a speech in New York, at which time I quoted the words of an American friend: "China is now in Valley Forge; but I hope she will soon be in Yorktown." You know this, your own history, and from your history, I would like to cite a few words to remind you of the terrible suffering that George Washington's army encountered in Valley Forge in the winter of 1777. "When the poor soldiers marched toward their winter quarters on December 17, 1777, they left a bloody trail behind them...On December 23, Washington reported to Congress that 2,898 men in his camp were unfit for duty because they were barefoot. Cold and hunger increased the number of sick; in the hospital, people often died for lack of straw to lie on." That was the situation in Valley Forge in the winter of 1777. But the founding fathers who created the American Republic did not give up the war. They continued to fight, and four years later, they finally achieved the final victory in Yorktown. By comparison, we have indeed moved away from the difficult period of Valley Forge, so we must not give up halfway until we have achieved national independence and freedom.

Second, we understand very well that the aggressors are not willing to give up because they are insatiable. You certainly have not forgotten the peace of Munich in 1938. When the four great peace creators returned to their country from Munich, they were warmly welcomed by the people because they had avoided a war and kept Europe at peace. At that time, Chamberlain said to the world, "I believe this is the peace of our generation." But, friends, where is the peace that the four great government leaders of Europe signed and guaranteed?

It is impossible to achieve true peace in the Far East at present. Because today's peace in the Far East will be the second Munich, perhaps worse than Munich. No politician in the world today dares to initiate such a Far Eastern Munich; and the government and people of China will never accept it.

Third, the surrender or collapse of China today is equivalent to a major disaster for the world's democratic countries in resisting the aggression of authoritarian countries. You have seen the news that the Tripartite Pact was signed in Berlin a month ago, which clearly tells you that Japan, Germany, and Italy have become military allies. The three years of China's war have weakened Japan's national power, making it unable to actively assist its European partners in aggression. As American military expert Elliot said, "When we think of Britain fighting for freedom, we must not forget that China is also fighting for freedom, and China has been fighting heroically for more than three years. The invading armies that China is resisting and the invading armies that Britain is resisting have colluded with each other, and we are preparing to resist these invading armies." Therefore, if we surrender now, we will not only allow the aggressive forces in the East to do whatever they want, but also deal a great blow to the democratic powers that are now focusing on the struggle for life and death.

For these reasons, China is still fighting intermittently. (End)

De Gaulle Headquarters Established in Shanghai, French Nationals in the Far East Have Responded Enthusiastically

According to sources, the Free French De Gaulle Headquarters has been established in Shanghai to be responsible for propaganda work and to raise money for French nationals to volunteer to go to London and various places under the command of General De Gaulle. In November of last year, a total of 23 people from the Far East went to London or Africa to join the Free French Army. The number increased significantly in December. On New Year's Day this year, 26 sailors from the French freighter Dada South went to Hong Kong to join the Free French Army. It is expected that more French nationals in the Far East, including Vietnam, will rise up and respond to General De Gaulle's call, drawing their swords and fighting for freedom. In addition to Shanghai, De Gaulle Headquarters have also been established in Hong Kong and Singapore.

New Highs in the Red Market, Domestic Debt Credit is Stronger than Ever, Principal and Interest Due Have Been Deposited in Special Accounts, Funds Should Be Allocated According to Pro Rata Shares from Various Free Customs

The Ministry of Finance has always fulfilled its debt repayment obligations on schedule, especially the customs-guaranteed debt reparations, which have never been overdue. It has repeatedly advanced large sums of money for timely repayment, which has long been admired by Chinese and foreigners. Since customs revenues from war zones have been seized, it has been unavoidable to announce future customs debt repayment methods. The amount to be allocated from customs revenues outside war zones according to pro rata shares will be transferred to a special account at the Central Bank. The domestic debt fund to be allocated from various customs outside war zones in 1940 is 8,582,071.39 yuan, which has been transferred by the Chief Inspector of Customs, Mr. Merrell, to the Central Bank for storage, to be used for the payment of principal and interest on the Unified Reconstruction Golden Long Three Debt. The National Debt Fund Management Committee, in view of the fact that the amount to be allocated from customs outside war zones is insufficient to repay the three customs-guaranteed debts, has agreed with the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong to pay the matured interest and drawn principal of the Unified Reconstruction Golden Long Three Debt by discounting it through the four banks, which has been approved by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, bondholders have expressed their support for the government's measures. The prices on the unofficial securities market have soared, and the New Year's red market has reached a new post-war high.

Unified Public Debt

The principal of the 1936 Unified Repayment of Principal has been drawn, and payment will begin on January 31. Shanghai will be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted China and Communications Banks. According to the discount method, the bondholder must fill out a discount voucher application form. After verification, it will be paid in six installments, one installment per month, until the end of June 1941. The principal to be paid this time is 15,430,000 yuan, and the interest is 41,061,300 yuan, for a total of 56,491,300 yuan.

Reconstruction Public Debt

The total amount of the 1936 Reconstruction Public Debt is 340 million yuan. The tenth drawing of principal will be held by the National Debt Fund Management Committee at 10:00 AM on the 10th of this month. The principal and matured interest of each drawn ticket will be paid from February 28. The payment method is the same as for the Unified. The principal to be paid this time is 2,720,000 yuan, and the interest is 9,600,8400 yuan, for a total of 12,328,400 yuan. The paying agencies are the Central Bank and its entrusted China and Communications Banks.

Golden Long Public Debt

The total amount of the 1928 Financial Long-Term Public Debt is 45 million yuan. The seventeenth drawing of principal will be held by the National Debt Fund Management Committee on March 10. The drawn bonds and matured interest will be paid from March 31. The principal repaid is 1,125,000 yuan, and the interest paid is 337,500 yuan, for a total of 1,462,500 yuan. The outstanding debt amount is 25,875,000 yuan. The payment method this time is the same as for the Unified Reconstruction.

Coal Stolen from US Military Camp

Mi Wengan and Zhu Ada, local residents working as odd job workers in the US military camp, colluded with cleaners Luo Yongren, Cao Zijing, Chen Asan, and Gu Hengrong on and before the 3rd of this month to steal white coal from the military camp. Yesterday, they were discovered by the soldiers on duty in the army, who first detained the defendants and then reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Chinese detectives Zhu Chiqing and Xia Yishan brought Zhu et al. back to the police station for investigation. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court and prosecuted for theft. Judge Liu presided over the court session. The defendant Zhu Wengan confessed that the idea of stealing coal came from the cleaner Luo Yongren, who said that he was responsible for hiding the coal in the garbage truck, covering it with garbage, and selling it without leaking the secret. Unfortunately, it was discovered only on the fourth theft. He was willing to hand over the dozens of yuan of stolen money in full and asked the court not to convict him, etc. After verifying the facts, the court questioned the other defendants, whose confessions were mutually evasive. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody pending judgment.

Bank Employee Found Guilty in Embezzlement Case

Employee of the Transportation Bank Sentenced to Five Years, Embezzled US$13,000, Sentenced by the British Supreme Court

British Supreme Court Judge Jones sentenced Mark Zeller to five years in prison yesterday. Mark Zeller, an employee of American Express Bank, was charged with embezzlement and successively embezzled US$6,000 and another US$7,000. Mark, a graduate of Xavier School, is famous in the sports world in this city. After the presiding judge finalized the verdict, the judge read the judgment, saying that Mark's embezzlement at American Express Bank may have had its reasons, but it was ultimately inexcusable, and the defendant had accused his superiors and colleagues, but could not provide evidence.

Shen Zhongfang Kidnapping Case, Gangsters Scheduled for Continued Trial

US Decides to Supply War Equipment to Aid and Maintain Free Nations, Believes Axis Nations Cannot Win, Woodhead Supplements Roosevelt's Remarks

According to the English-language Greater America Evening News yesterday, Woodhead's comments stated that President Roosevelt's "fireside chat" broadcast in the United States on December 29 of last year can be called the most important speech made by a head of state in the past ten years. President Roosevelt's original speech was very long, lasting for 40 minutes when broadcast, but what was published in various newspapers in this port at that time was only a glimpse. Here are some supplementary remarks on the more important ones. Among them, regarding the United States' guarantee to aid Britain and other countries that maintain world freedom with aircraft, tanks, artillery, freighters, and other war equipment, so that these countries can fight for their own freedom and the safety of the United States, President Roosevelt said, "The United States' expansion of armaments and the transportation of weapons and supplies that we can save to help the defenders fighting on the front line is of great help to the democratic countries' resistance to aggressors and must be of greater help. This action of ours is more neutral than the daily transport of steel, ore, oil, and other war materials into Germany by Sweden, the Soviet Union, and other countries neighboring Germany. The heroic Greek army and the armies of the various exiled governments have provided Britain with invaluable military assistance. Britain's strength has increased without decreasing. This is due to the efforts of the general men and women of Britain, who value freedom even more than their lives. I firmly believe that the Warring Nations cannot win. This belief of mine is based on the most recent and detailed information. We cannot forgive those who advocate failure. We have various reasons to hope for justice and peace, to defend our civilization, and to build a more perfect 'civilization' in the future."

Seducing a Virgin

Huang Qingyu (55 years old), a Shaoxing native residing at 43 Rue Pére Robert, has a daughter named Xia Lan, 19 years old, who is beautiful. On December 17th of last year, she went out shopping at 9:00 AM and was lured by Yu Ahua, a clerk from the Fangxinji jute bag shop at No. 33 next door, to the Fair Hotel at the entrance of Baoyu Lane, Rue Edward VII. After spending the night in room 301, Yu's boss, Fang Xinzong, helped Yu to arrange a marriage and took her to the Taiping Hotel on Taiping Bridge and the Fuxin Hotel on Kangti Road for four consecutive nights. After Huang lost his daughter, he searched everywhere without a trace. It was not until the 22nd of the same month that his daughter escaped from the hotel under a pretext and told her grandmother about being seduced. She was sent back after someone was sent to tell her about the seduction. After Huang inquired his daughter, he learned about the situation. His daughter had already been promised to someone, and now she was seduced by Yu and others. He was shocked and reported to the French police station, requesting an investigation. The police chief sent detectives to arrest Yu and Fang for interrogation and sent the girl to the hospital for examination. The hymen had already been broken, so it was not accepted. Both parties were asked to go out and negotiate on their own. At this point, Huang was unwilling to submit and has hired lawyer Du Xi to proceed with negotiations and lawsuits according to law.

Economic Special Issue: The Reform of China's Financial Institutions After the War by Wang Yutong

Since the currency system reform in 1935, China's entire financial situation has made significant progress, and the effectiveness has been greatly demonstrated. Since the military uprising, more than three years have passed, and the government has promulgated various supplementary financial regulations, so the financial institutions have become stable. This has long been praised by Chinese and foreigners. A few years ago, in order to strengthen the central financial institutions, the financial authorities organized a joint office of the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong. The purpose of this organization is to use the convenience of the four banks' branches to make China's financial bloodline and financial administration closely connected. When changes occur in local finance, the four banks have the opportunity to contribute their opinions at any time; and when the Ministry of Finance has emergency financial measures, the four banks can also be the government's executive agency at any time, making the wartime financial foundation more solid than a rock. All of this is a major plan that the current government is painstakingly worried about to cope with the environment. Now that the light has begun to appear, and the dawn is not far away, how should the financial system be rebuilt in the future to adapt to post-war China? In today's view, it is urgent to prepare for a rainy day and study it in time. Is its importance less than wartime finance?

I believe that the biggest shortcomings of China's past financial system lie in its dispersion and lack of system. Government banks have suffered from their own weak strength and have not been able to fully perform their regulatory functions at any time, while general commercial banks have also been self-governing and have failed to fully cooperate with government banks. Therefore, in peacetime, if a financial crisis is encountered, there is always a lack of a center for liaison, which makes the crisis easily tend to expand and endanger the social economy. Therefore, the promulgation of the legal tender policy is recognized by all parties as a manifestation of the financial authorities' long-term vision and thorough determination to rectify the financial system. Although there were many internal and external obstacles at that time, the government's perseverance in promoting it eventually led to success, and it was able to calmly cope with the financial situation in the early stages of the war. As the war gradually expanded, the government successively promulgated various financial measures and regulations to keep wartime finance stable, complementing military affairs and avoiding the government's worries. All of this is only a statement of the current situation; now, I would like to offer seven points on the issue of the reconstruction of China's financial system after the war, based on my limited knowledge:

The Formation of the Financial System and the Establishment of the Bank Specialization System

The establishment of financial institutions depends first on the formation of the financial system and the establishment of the bank specialization system. China's banks and the entire financial organization have not yet reached a healthy stage of development. There are no individual specialized advancement goals, and there is a lack of mutual coordination and regulation. The names of the banks appear to be different on the surface, but in terms of the channels for their capital utilization, except for the specialized special banks set up by the government, they all tend to take the same path, and industries such as agriculture, industry, mining, and animal husbandry that are waiting for relief lack opportunities for financial accommodation. On the one hand, there is also a lack of common adjustment between the central bank and general banks. Therefore, the entire financial organization must be redistributed. The central bank must be made to occupy the central position of the national finance, and professional banks such as agriculture, industry, mining, and international trade, general banks, savings banks, postal savings bureaus, trust companies, insurance companies, and various industrial and commercial organizations must be made its veins, so that the national financial organization can be given considerable functions for both public and private economies, whether in terms of regional distribution or industrial connection. The specialization system has long been established in various countries, and although China has also followed suit, it is actually a misnomer and should be thoroughly promoted. The methods are as follows:

1.  Commercial Finance: handled by general commercial banks. Its tasks are:

(1) Adjust the turnover of commercial finance
(2) Accept commercial deposits
(3) Mortgage loans for commercial goods
(4) Commercial credit loans
(5) Discount loans for commercial bills
(6) Commercial import and export bills
(7) Other commercial businesses

2.  Exchange Finance or Trade Finance: handled by international exchange banks. Its tasks are:

(1) Manage exchange balance international trade
(2) Set exchange rates and sell foreign exchange
(3) Transport legal tender and sell domestic exchange
(4) Import and export bills for domestic and foreign goods
(5) Buy and sell foreign currencies to balance the exchange fund
(6) Accept interbank deposits and manage bill exchange
(7) Other exchange tasks

3.  Industrial Finance: handled by industrial banks. Its tasks are:

(1) Construction and financial accommodation of transportation
(2) Development and capital planning and financial accommodation of forestry, mining, fishing, and animal husbandry
(3) Supervise the progress of each of these businesses
(4) Accept deposits from each of these businesses
(5) Manage the issuance, fundraising, and sales of stocks and bonds of each of these businesses
(6) Review the reports

### German Newspaper's View: Air Force Assisting Italy, Showing Axis Powers Can Still Fight Side-by-Side

Hamburg: The "Hamburger Fremdenblatt" commented yesterday on the deployment of the German Air Force to assist Italy, stating that the British military's view that the military measures of the Axis countries on the two battle lines cannot be completely consistent has now been shattered. The dispatch of the German Air Force to Italy shows that the battlefield between Gibraltar and the Suez Canal now has significant importance. Britain's current military action is to spy on the weakness of the Mediterranean in an attempt to reverse its unfavorable position, but it will eventually be defeated by the joint action of Germany and Italy.

### Italy Vigorously Seeking to Continue the War: Emergency Conscription Law Formulated by the Cabinet

Rome: It is announced here that the Italian cabinet, after hearing the speech of Prime Minister Mussolini, yesterday formulated an emergency conscription bill, which shows that Italy is eagerly seeking to continue the war. The bill stipulates that the training of naval officers will be accelerated, and officers who have never been conscripted before will be summoned to serve in the air force and engineering corps. Many of these officers are over the age limit for military service. The bill also stipulates that the pensions for the widows and orphans of Italian soldiers killed in battle will be doubled, and the prices of various medicines have been decided by the cabinet. At the same time, according to a government order carried by Italian officials, the appropriation for the Ministry of Interior will be increased by 17 million lire this year, which will be used for "political investigation" expenses.

### Southern Ireland and Germany May Break off Diplomatic Relations

Dublin: It is generally believed that after Southern Ireland obtained new evidence of the German bombing of the Dublin area last night, if Germany fails to give a satisfactory reply to Southern Ireland's protest and stop the bombing, Southern Ireland may break off diplomatic relations with Germany. After Southern Ireland was extensively bombed in various districts on Saturday, the Irish government lodged a formal protest with the German government, because neutral Southern Ireland has been subjected to air raids for several days, which has reached a climax. After the magnetic mines discovered in the Dublin area were positively identified as coming from the German side, the recent trend has been to blame German warplanes. Observers here claim that Hitler is using bombing to force Southern Ireland into the arms of Britain, and every Nazi bomb dropped on Irish territory will increase the possibility of Southern Ireland agreeing to use its ports as naval bases for Britain. This plan was originally rejected by Prime Minister de Valera, but since the German bombing, some senior Irish officials believe that Southern Ireland's neutrality will no longer be maintained. It is pointed out that if Britain can obtain Irish ports, it can give Britain a weapon to resist the threat of German submarines and German ships. Since the outbreak of the European war, the losses of British ships have made Britain feel threatened, which has been formally recognized by some British government officials.

### Soviet Union Raises Education Level

Moscow: The Pravda commented, "The education level of the Soviet people is increasing every year, and countless young men and women graduate from higher education institutions every year and are scattered in factories and institutions. The number of scientific institutions has also increased. In 1939, there were 694 scientific institutions nationwide, which increased to 772 last year. A year ago, there were 46,000 public libraries in the Soviet Union. In terms of art, Belarus and the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic made great achievements last year. Recently, music festivals have been held in various cities in the Soviet Union, and an art exhibition will be held soon. The masterpieces of all Soviet artists in the past 23 years will be exhibited publicly. This year, the new Baltic republics will also hold art festivals. In short, the culture of the Soviet Union in 1941 will be even more developed. (TASS News Agency dispatch on the 5th)
