Chongqing - A Central News Agency report from a certain location in Central China today stated that General Li Zongren, commander of the Fifth War Area of the Chinese army, said that the Chinese army has won the battle in Henan Province. The Japanese side has also admitted defeat in a wireless broadcast. The Japanese army launched a large-scale offensive on January 24, advancing north along the Pinghan Railway and deploying columns to the east and west, but was defeated by the Chinese army. It is reported that General Li said that the Japanese wireless broadcast fully admitted being defeated by our army and stated that they clearly understood the reasons for the defeat. The Chinese army launched a flanking attack, defeating the Japanese army, and used mobile warfare to force the Japanese army to retreat. Not long ago, Li said, "I had anticipated that the Japanese army would attack north, so I immediately went to Chongqing to discuss with Chairman Chiang, who authorized me to deal with the offensive. I acted according to the plan and was able to win the offensive. All units of our army that participated in the battle made rapid use of effective ambush, enticement, and encirclement strategies, resulting in heavy casualties for the Japanese army."

Chongqing - General Bai Chongxi, Deputy Chief of Staff, reported on the situation of the Henan campaign at the Central Government-State Council joint memorial meeting this morning. He stated briefly that in previous battles, we suffered great losses due to holding a single line. Later, we adopted a war of attrition, striking the Japanese at any time. Regarding this decisive battle, our side followed the instructions of the Supreme Commander, and the strategy and tactics were well coordinated, so the number of casualties was not high. The results achieved were enormous. Since the Japanese launched their offensive on the 24th of last month, within half a month, their casualties have been many times greater than ours. Our operational plan was to avoid direct confrontation in the Niuyuan area, thereby preventing the enemy's aircraft and tanks from fully exerting their power, and encircling and annihilating them everywhere. This is truly a great victory for our side. (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Editorial

### Prospects for French Troubles

If France were seen as having lost all its international standing because of its defeat, and if newspaper commentary had to be concerned with the rise and fall of the overall situation, then what we are discussing today would hardly be worth mentioning. However, that is not the case. Although France is under the control of its victorious enemies and bound by the armistice agreement, France's immediate mobilization of all its forces to choose its direction is no longer a decisive factor in the final victory or defeat of the entire world change. However, the length, twists, and turns of the process from now until the final victory or defeat is decided, and the required suffering, hardships, sacrifices, destruction, and how France chooses, follows, associates, and opposes the evolving international divide have a great impact. It is certainly not the same as other defeated countries such as Poland, Norway, and Belgium. Some believe that France is finished, but France is definitely not finished. Some believe that France has withdrawn from the international stage, but France has definitely not withdrawn. Unless the French themselves are willing to sell out their country, destroy their instincts, sever their vitality, and sink into vassalage. And everything that has been acted out between Vichy and Paris in recent days is casting France's future and brewing the prelude to France's future role in the entire world change. What will it finally cast and brew? We still have to wait for future facts to explain. People must not be blinded by the so-called overall world change that is far away and vast, and mistakenly regard France's recent troubles as branches and leaves outside the trunk and episodes outside the main drama.

The night before last, it was rumored that Marshal Pétain, the head of the French Vichy government, had fled to Africa because he could not cope with his situation, but it was later proven that the rumor was absolutely false. Last night, it was rumored that the French cabinet had been reorganized. The main changes are: Admiral Darlan, Pétain's confidant who was recently ordered to shuttle between Vichy and Paris, was promoted to cabinet assistant and remained Minister of the Navy; Admiral Darlan, who is regarded as an authority in the Vichy Navy, was appointed Foreign Minister; and Laval, a pro-German leader, a "planet" in the political world, and the central figure in this decision of troubles, was not only not able to fulfill his great wish to take sole power as Prime Minister, but also did not take the stage. As of the time the reporter was writing, this news had not been confirmed. The focus of this Vichy trouble, in short, is the struggle between the Pétain center and the Laval center. In other words, it can also be said to be the struggle between the Vichy "French" Franco-German compromise center and the Vichy "German" Franco-German compromise center. Although these two centers both give up resistance and seek compromise for the sake of survival, the differences in degree are almost irreconcilable. Therefore, if Laval succeeds in becoming Prime Minister as he wishes, it will transform France's France and international France, its policies and actions, into those of Germany. Even if Pétain's position remains the same, it will make Vichy completely different. To hear about the Vichy troubles and think that this is a domestic political storm in France is a great mistake that neglects the more important international causes and effects. Of course, these kinds of troubles are still the continuation of narrow-minded partisan struggles in French political history, and even misguided partisan struggles, which can make those close to them feel pain and those who are resentful feel happy. Therefore, it cannot be denied that this trouble also contains innate political characteristics because it has more important international causes and effects. But is it ultimately something that we cannot equate with past partisan struggles? Is it something that we deserve to look at differently? We must wait for Marshal Pétain's future performance to determine its nature.

Compared to Laval, many people sympathize with Pétain. But what will be the specific programs of Laval's pro-German stance, and what will be the degree of Pétain's so-called "Monetary Policy"? The differences are so great that they are almost irreconcilable, but it is also very difficult to explain them practically. In retreat, what conditions does Germany use to support Laval, and what demands does Germany use to coerce Pétain, have not been disclosed. In terms of intention, what Germany wants from France today is: (1) France's naval, land, and air forces should be at Germany's command to participate in future offensives against Britain; (2) The naval and air force bases remaining in France and in Africa should be available for Germany's use as stepping stones for Germany's attack on Britain; (3) The German army should pass through the free zone under the jurisdiction of the Vichy government to threaten Spain, attack the rear of the British naval port of Gibraltar, threaten Britain's interests in the Mediterranean with the French Mediterranean coast, and strengthen everything for Italy. These are roughly the three main points. If this intention is not false, then the motive on the German side in this decision of the Vichy troubles, whether international or political, is precisely "military" without a doubt. From a military point of view: How much of the air force that France has left can fight on the front lines? The quality is difficult to determine, but it is definitely not equal to zero. Not to mention the warships scattered in various places, there are still more than one hundred ships in the port of Toulon. The army in French Africa, directly commanded by General Weygand, also reaches 300,000. This is a force that cannot be underestimated. It is not an exaggeration to call it a great force. This is where Pétain's prestige lies, and it is Vichy's international capital. This is what Germany is jealous of, and what Laval wants to take and use!

It is said that Laval did not take office, and the great Vichy did not change its nature through this trouble. If he does take office, or if it changes its nature, but the main component of this capital is made up of humans with hearts and minds, then it is not a capital that anyone can withdraw once they are in charge. Even if Laval takes Pétain's position and replaces him, how can he be sure of success!

### The United States is Distributing Naval and Air Personnel to Cope with Any Situation; the "Day of Reckoning" in the Pacific is Approaching

Washington - Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox told reporters yesterday that wireless electricity and film should cooperate with the government to keep the secrets of naval activities, so as not to benefit the powerful enemies of the United States. Knox is also the publisher of a certain newspaper. He denied that a peacetime censorship system would be implemented, and only said that he only asked everyone to give the government this kind of cooperation. He said, "What the enemy does not know will not benefit the enemy," and also said that the Navy Department has reached an understanding with newspapers, magazines, wireless radio, and photography agencies not to publicize the movements of warships and aircraft, as well as secret military equipment and new shipbuilding plans. He warned the people, "In the current extraordinary period, the people may want to know a lot about the Navy's preparations, but this information may be leaked out due to someone's failure to keep secrets. Therefore, we should remember one thing, every word uttered from the mouth and every sentence published in newspapers and magazines may destroy an arsenal, sink a warship, or kill countless Ren Shi who work day and night for the safety of the United States. The Navy Department is now taking one of all the actions we deem correct, carefully distributing our warships, aircraft, and personnel so that we can cope with any situation in case of necessity. If the plan for this distribution is known to the public, then our stubborn enemies can prepare in advance in response to our military movements." (United Press dispatch, 10th)

Washington - The unofficial but well-informed Sea, Land, and Air Force magazine warned Japan yesterday that the "day of reckoning" in the Pacific is approaching, at which time the British and American governments will have the opportunity to take action. The magazine said that Japan is currently increasing its forces in French Vietnam, and its "attempt to occupy a naval base there is very obvious." The publication also said, "The British and American governments are closely watching the ambitions of the Japanese and are strongly assisting their representatives in Vietnam. The Tokyo government knows that Britain is currently unable to intervene militarily in Asia, and the United States is not prepared to do so. Therefore, Japan will undoubtedly be able to act freely in Asia before the situation becomes favorable to Britain or the policies and interests of the United States are further disregarded. However, Japanese politicians should remember one thing, that there will eventually be a day of reckoning. When the British and American governments have the opportunity to take joint action, the day of reckoning will come." (United Press dispatch, 10th)

### Powerful British Bomber Squadrons Fly to Northern Malaya to Increase Defense; Large Numbers of Indian Troops Gather on the Thai Border; Rumors that Japan is Preparing to Attack Singapore

Singapore - Several powerful British bomber squadrons have now taken off from here to reinforce the forward air force bases in northern Malaya, which proves that the joint efforts of the British and Australian air forces in recent months have greatly increased their strength. (Reuters dispatch, October)

Singapore - It was announced here today that a squadron of Royal Air Force Blenheim bombers has departed from Singapore to reinforce the air station in northern Malaya. Because the strength of the Singapore Air Force has recently been increased, it has been able to transfer reinforcements to enhance the security of other places in Malaya. (United Press dispatch, 10th)

Melbourne - Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief Far East, who arrived here by plane today, convened an Australian defense conference here with the Australian Air Minister and the Chiefs of Staff of the Australian Navy, Army, and Air Force to discuss. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

Bangkok - 15,000 troops from the British Indian Army have been concentrated near the Thai border in British Malaya. According to reliable sources carried by two major newspapers here yesterday, the British Minister has notified the Thai government, stating that, in view of the tense situation, Britain has sent 15,000 Indian troops to Malaya to be stationed. It is understood that the troops are now concentrated near the border between Thailand and Malaya. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 10th)

New Delhi - Retired US General Stirling recently sent a letter to the United Press, saying that Japan is preparing to attack Singapore. The letter said that Japan is calmly moving its naval, land, and air forces to the Malay Peninsula, so that when it goes to war with Britain and the United States, it can attack Singapore or Manila. Singapore is also an important target for any attack launched on the Dutch East Indies. Cam Ranh Bay, which the Japanese are trying to control, is also an ideal location for the Japanese fleet to be stationed when attacking Singapore. At this time, it seems that the Japanese are using clever methods in the peace negotiations between Thailand and Vietnam to obtain various bases in Thailand and Vietnam. Once Thailand is controlled and the Japanese have a direct route to Vietnam, the Japanese invasion of Malaya can be accomplished, thereby placing Singapore under fire. All kinds of situations can be used to infer that the Japanese have not given up their ambition to occupy Singapore. The Japanese are now trying to obtain all kinds of bases necessary to attack Singapore. The Japanese transportation line, starting from its main base, has the bases of Amami Oshima, Taiwan, Hainan Island, the Spratly Islands, and the current Cam Ranh Bay, which are of good quality and strongly defended. On the side of these transportation lines are the Philippine Islands, but Japan naturally feels that its naval and air forces with these bases will be able to compete with any American naval bases. However, if Japan goes to war with Britain and the United States, it will occupy the bays of Palawan Island, the Maramambia Strait, and Ulong Bay, and at the same time, before attacking Manila, it will occupy Singapore. Cam Ranh Bay, the best bay on the Annamese coast, is very large and enough to accommodate all kinds of warships, even huge battleships can be moored. The area has two ports, an inner port and an outer port, both surrounded by mountains. The main road leading to the outer port is one and three-quarters of a mile wide and twelve to fifteen fathoms deep, with no danger of navigation. In the Russo-Japanese War, Cam Ranh Bay was noticed. At that time, the entire Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet, on its way to Port Arthur to fight against Admiral Togo Heihachiro's fleet, stopped here for three weeks. The French never developed Cam Ranh Bay into a military port, perhaps because the French relied on the British Navy to defend against Japanese aggression at the time. Therefore, the current situation of the area can only be used for Japanese warships to be stationed. It would take quite some time to build the area into a suitable base, with dry docks, machine shops, and fuel depots. If the Japanese use this place, all materials must be transported from Japan. However, Japan can use repair ships and ferries to quickly make Cam Ranh Bay a base for submarines and destroyers, and leave the rest of the work (building a military port) for later.

### If Japan Does Not Break Away from the Axis, It Will Be Extremely Difficult to Restore Old Ties with the United States; Philippine Commissioner Says to Prepare for Defense Against Aggression as Soon as Possible

Washington - Congressional figures here today believe that if Japan does not break away from the Rome-Berlin Axis, it will be impossible for the United States to restore old ties with it. Far East observers here are now quietly awaiting the arrival of Japan's new ambassador to the United States, Nomura, hoping that he can initiate progress that will strongly influence current U.S.-Japan relations. It is said that the nature of this progress depends on whether Japan can break away from the Axis powers. Congressional figures in Washington yesterday expressed deep dissatisfaction with the current efforts to improve U.S.-Japan relations. Senator Gilley, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from Illinois, predicted that Congress would soon "give Japan a lesson" by expanding the embargo against Japan. Senior and respected Senator Ellender, a Democrat from Louisiana, said that as long as Japan does not break away from the Axis powers, there will be no opportunity to restore normal U.S.-Japan relations. Ellender has always advocated large-scale cotton exports and has been sympathetic to Japan. However, he said, "As long as Japan maintains its relationship with the Axis powers, I do not believe that Americans are willing to continue friendly negotiations with Japan. If Japan wants to establish understanding and friendly relations with our government and people, it must break away from the Axis powers." (United Press, 10th)

Washington - Philippine Commissioner to Washington, Elizalde, yesterday warned Filipinos to prepare for defense against aggressive forces. Of all the statements he has made since taking office in Washington, this one was the most intense. He made this statement after discussing defense issues with U.S. administrative leaders, including Vice President Wallace, at the end of the week. He said, "We must be prepared to dedicate everything we have to defend our way of life and everything we hold dear." Last Saturday, Army Chief of Staff Peterson said, "The Philippine Islands are only a street away from aggressive forces." Elizalde was also present at the meeting when Peterson made this statement. Therefore, Elizalde said yesterday, "The Philippine Islands should pay special attention to the facts that threaten us and threaten all democratic countries." He said that the United States is deeply aware of this danger, so the House of Representatives finally adopted the Lend-Lease Act last week. Filipinos have always lived a life without conflict, but they should be prepared to deal with forces "opposed to democracy" when necessary. (United Press, 10th)

### British Armored Vanguard Advances Toward Tripoli; Large Group of Italian Troops Heads to North Africa for Reinforcements

Cairo - After occupying Al Agheila, a coastal town south of Benghazi, the British armored vanguard is advancing rapidly towards Tripoli. In addition to the already reported corps commander, the Italian troops captured by the British in Benghazi included five senior generals and thousands of soldiers. According to recent communiqués, Italian troops in Eritrea are in disarray and are being pursued by British forces, retreating towards Agordat. British aircraft are harassing them, repeatedly bombing motor transport troops, artillery positions, and other targets in and around Keren. On the ground in Aromo, south of Lake Tana in Abyssinia, eight Italian aircraft were shot down and destroyed. Officials also announced that a heavy blow had been dealt to an enemy military camp. Al Agheila, recently occupied by Allied forces, is a small town with a population of one thousand, with barracks, a radio station, and an emergency landing strip. The town is located at the extreme southern end of the Gulf of Sidra, 175 miles from Benghazi and ten miles from the border of the Tripolitania region. Moving west, Al Agheila is an important location before reaching the Sidra Desert. British Air Force communiqués stated that British aircraft bombed fleeing Italian troops and enemy barracks near Dangil, south of Lake Tana. The airfield in the Taishi area was also attacked, with hits on hangars and buildings. An enemy aircraft was shot down near Diffe, and one person in the aircraft was captured. It is confirmed that in this air battle, another enemy aircraft was also destroyed. On February 7th and 8th, Italian aircraft attacked Malta, dropping some bombs, but there were no British air force casualties or damage. A British aircraft reported missing in the February 3rd communiqué has now returned to base. (Reuters, 10th)

Rome - Anselmi, a well-known Italian military commentator and editor-in-chief of the Lavoro Fascista newspaper, implied in his newspaper today that a large group of Italian troops is currently being rushed from Italy to North Africa to assist General Graziani's forces. It is reported that Graziani is currently concentrating all his forces along the Tripoli coastal area, which has apparently become Italy's latest defensive line in North Africa. Today's war report issued by the Italian High Command only briefly mentioned the military situation in Libya and made no mention of developments in Eritrea. (International News Service, 10th)

### British Prime Minister's Broadcast Reviews the Overall War Situation; The Situation is Improving and Victory Can be Expected; Strongly Urges Balkan People to Unite

London - British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a broadcast speech to Britain and its imperial departments last night, saying, "At a time when the two dictators seemed to have gained so much victory, we stood firm and dealt with them, and finally showed that we were capable of fighting them alone. Since I decided to broadcast to the country, it has been more than five months. During wartime, we should focus on practice rather than empty words. We may as well review at any time. Indeed, our situation has developed well in several aspects in the past four or five months, even better than we dared to hope.

German Terrorist Bombing Cannot Crush British Morale

After the German Air Force suffered heavy losses from our fighters in August and September, although Hitler felt it was necessary to invade Britain and had made great preparations for the invasion, he ultimately did not dare to try. Instead, he first bombed London and then attacked our other cities, in an attempt to destroy the spirit of the British people. It should be known that this cruel form of murder and terror not only failed to weaken our morale, but made it even stronger, reaching a level unprecedented among modern people, winning the admiration of the world and American friends. The British Empire is proud of its motherland and is willing to stay with it to the end. Its love for the motherland flows from overseas, and we are deeply moved by it. We must live up to its love and maintain it. This is the first goal of our war. In these dark winter months, the enemy drops three or four hundred tons of bombs on us every day, and we return ten tons to Germany.

Sanitary Arrangements are Well-Prepared, and No Epidemics Have Occurred

The bombing of London and other cities has reminded me of the Battle of Waterloo. They are not soldiers and do not wear armor. They are just ordinary civilians, men, women, old and young, but their spirit is no different, and their glory is the same. Their victory will be even greater than the famous Battle of Waterloo. This honor belongs to various civil defense teams, whether they are temporary troops or regular troops, volunteers or professional soldiers, who have assisted civilians during this terrible disaster that civilized people have never encountered. Now that more than two-thirds of the winter has passed, and no epidemics have occurred in the country, even though the facilities in the air-raid shelters were hastily prepared, civilian diseases have not increased. This is due to the well-prepared arrangements of the local health authorities, nursing teams, and the Ministry of Health. Now the Minister of Health, MacDonald, will go to Canada for important tasks. More than half of the winter has passed, the days are getting longer, and the strength of the British Air Force is gradually increasing, becoming the master of the daytime sky. Air raids will be allowed to be more intense in the future, but the time will be shorter, and there will be more opportunities for various tasks.

Italy's Defeat in Africa Has Caused Military Prestige to Plummet

In October, a strange thing happened overseas, that is, Mussolini, one of the two dictators, a cunning, cold-blooded, and black-hearted Italian, who stabbed defeated France in the back, trying to create an empire at a low price, threw himself into the net. Mussolini was blinded by greed and invaded Greece for no reason, resulting in humiliation and defeat by the Greek army. While he was being whipped by the Greek army in Albania, Generals Wavell and Wilson were ordered to protect Egypt and the Suez Canal to fulfill our country's treaty obligations. Those who once felt the difficulty of their work have been provided with very strong supplies of troops, guns, tanks, and all equipment sent by Britain regardless of the threat of invasion. At the same time, large armies from India, Australia, and New Zealand have all arrived in Africa. Thus, the British victory in Libya began, and Italy's military prestige in Africa plummeted, beyond recovery.

Egypt and the Suez Canal are Now Safe and Worry-Free

The British offensive in Libya was initially a very dangerous operation, but the great victory of capturing tens of thousands of prisoners proved the strength of British combat power and the sharpness of its weapons. The other Italian troops in eastern Libya are obviously in great danger. They cannot retreat along the coastal road without being severely hit by the British armored divisions. Therefore, the Italian army is in a difficult situation, attacked from all sides and completely wounded. We all know that the ancient saying says, "Seek and you shall find, search and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you." Now the troops of our Nile River have sought and found, searched and obtained, knocked and opened. In just eight weeks since the offensive was launched, traveling more than four hundred miles, the military effectiveness can be a model. Of the more than fifteen Italian divisions in the east, they have now been either captured or annihilated. Cyrenaica, with an area almost the same as England, has now been conquered. Egypt and the Suez Canal are now safe and worry-free, and the ports and airfields seized by the British army have now become strategically important strongholds in the eastern Mediterranean.

Naval Power in the Mediterranean is Entirely in British Hands

The achievements of General Wavell and his generals are particularly commendable. Wavell recently telegraphed that the success of the Battle of Benghazi was due in part to the assistance of the Air Force and the Navy. If British pilots could not seize control of the skies from the enemy, which had more aircraft, or if the British fleet in the Mediterranean could not drive out the Italian Navy, forcing it to hide in its own ports, then the British army could not have won such a great victory on the Libyan battlefield. The great importance of the fact that naval power in the Mediterranean is entirely in British hands can be seen in what happened this morning. At dawn today, the British fleet in the western Mediterranean, under the command of Vice Admiral Somerville, sailed into the Gulf of Genoa and bombarded the naval base there in a devastating manner. That place is where German troops could launch attacks on British troops in Algiers or Tunisia. We should make the Italian people feel the sad state into which Mussolini has led them. If the sound of British artillery travels along the coast and through the mountains, reaching the ears of our French comrades, they should be happy to hear it, even in their sorrow. 1,500 miles south of here in southern France, a strong British Indian force, having driven the enemy out of Sudan, is now advancing towards Italian Eritrea to annihilate the Italian army in Abyssinia. Other British troops are currently attacking Abyssinia from the west, and Kenya has gathered a large army. Following them, there are South African troops attacking from the north along the entire border of Eritrea.

Shipping is at Risk of Being Destroyed; Britain Will Not Take it Lightly

We must now expect that Hitler will do everything he can to destroy our shipping and reduce the amount of supplies shipped from the United States to Britain. I do not take this danger lightly, but I am confident that our Navy, with the assistance of the Air Force, will be able to cope with any changes in the situation during this great war. With the loyal support of our merchant ships, sailors, and workers in various shipyards and ports, we will be able to crush any enemy trick. The world should believe that with God's blessing, we will succeed in everything. We do not retreat, we do not show weakness. Neither the horrors of the battlefield that come regularly nor the trials of long-term labor can defeat us. As long as we have weapons, we can complete this battle. These are the words I used in the name of the British people to reply to the letter from President Roosevelt, a great figure who has been elected as the leader of 130 million people three times. What Britain seeks from the United States is not soldiers, but only weapons and supplies. The British Prime Minister also urged the Balkan people to unite. If they can do so, and with the support of Britain and Turkey, the German Air Force will not be able to concentrate in southeastern Europe within a few months. (Reuters, 10th)

### British Admiralty Announces Details of Attack on Genoa; Naval and Air Forces Fire More Than 300 Tons of Bombs; Major Oil Refineries and Power Plants Catch Fire

London - Yesterday at dawn, the British Navy launched an extremely fierce bombardment of a major Italian port. The British fleet in the Mediterranean, composed of light and heavy warships, bombarded the historic fourth city of Italy, the port of Genoa, firing more than 300 tons of shells. At the same time, British naval aircraft attacked Pisa, famous for its Leaning Tower, dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs targeting military objectives. The large oil refinery in Leghorn, the front gate of the Italian fleet, was also attacked. Only one Swordfish aircraft was lost by the attacking British aircraft, while two Italian aircraft were shot down. According to details announced in an Admiralty communiqué, the British naval bombardment was even more successful than initially expected. Vice Admiral Somerville, who commanded the daring attack, had ships including the 32,000-ton battlecruiser Renown, the 31,000-ton battleship Malaya, the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, the 9,100-ton cruiser Sheffield, and several light ships. The results were as follows: Multiple shells caused fires in the famous Ansaldo power plant and boiler plant. The port's main power plant (which also supplied electricity for the railways) was damaged and caught fire. Dry docks, warehouses, and port facilities around the inner harbor were also hit by multiple shells, causing large fires. Several major oil depots, oil pools, supply ships, and the main railway freight depot were repeatedly hit by large shells. In addition, British naval aircraft attacked the Anic oil refinery in Leghorn and other large institutions nearby, dropping tons of bombs. The Anic plant is one of Italy's largest and most important oil refineries. Other naval aircraft bombed nearby airfields and critical railway junctions. Two Italian aircraft attempted to interfere but were shot down. One British aircraft is missing. In addition, there were no other casualties in this extremely successful military operation.

### After the Reorganization of the Vichy Cabinet, Darlan Holds Three Positions Simultaneously; Flandin Resigns as Foreign Minister Due to Circumstances; It is Reported that Laval Will Be Summoned to Form a Cabinet Soon

Vichy - As a result of the partial reorganization of the cabinet, Admiral Darlan has assumed the three key positions of Deputy Premier, Minister of the Navy, and Minister of Foreign Affairs, thus occupying a leading position in the cabinet. At the same time, he remains Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. The importance placed on him by Marshal Pétain can be seen from this. The powers of the Marshal have not changed, he remains the Head of State and the Head of Government, and all members of the cabinet are responsible to the Marshal alone. In addition, the position of Deputy Premier had only been held by Laval once since the parliamentary system was abolished. When Laval was dismissed on December 13 last year, this position was suspended until now. As for the powers of the Deputy Premier, there are no explicit provisions, but one point is very clear: when the cabinet needs to be reorganized, the Marshal should consult with the Deputy Premier on the selection of new cabinet members. The section in Article 4 of the Constitution stating that the Deputy Premier is the natural successor to the Marshal was repealed on December 13 last year and replaced with another clause stipulating that no one may be pre-designated as the Marshal's successor. Darlan's appointment as Deputy Premier was a natural result of his recent shuttling between Paris and Vichy, and did not come as a surprise. In short, he has been to Paris four times since last December, indicating that he has directly participated in the evolution of Franco-German relations. It is only natural that he should be appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs. (Havas, 9th)

London - Vichy has officially announced that Admiral Darlan, head of the Vichy fleet, will head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the newly organized Pétain government, replacing Flandin, who recently resigned. Darlan will also be Deputy Prime Minister (the position formerly held by Laval, which has been vacant since Laval's dismissal) and will remain Minister of the Navy. According to a dispatch from Vichy by the German official news agency, it is expected that all French ministers, except for Darlan of the Navy, General Huntziger of the Army, and the newly appointed Minister of Justice Barthelemy, will be replaced. With Flandin, who succeeded Laval as Foreign Minister, having resigned, Marshal Pétain is now free to reorganize his government. According to a communiqué issued by Vichy, Flandin had previously responded to Pétain's call for cooperation when the situation was complex. He now believes that it is appropriate to return his position to the control of the head of government. This gesture will give complete freedom to the great military leader who is solely responsible for leading France's destiny, so that he can take all the measures necessary for the current situation. The talks between Pétain and Laval after the meeting with Raffard, and Darlan's talks in Paris, have given a new realization to the Mondor (i.e., Franco-German cooperation) policy. The resulting situation may lead to some decisions in the near future. Pétain has warmly thanked Flandin for his resignation. (Reuters, 10th)

Vichy - When Foreign Minister Flandin submitted his resignation, he sent a letter to Marshal Pétain explaining the reasons for his resignation. The letter stated, "Changes occurred in domestic affairs at the end of last year. These developments were originally unrelated to my position. I was honored to be appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs on December 14 last year, and I immediately followed the guidelines instructed by you and made every effort. Since taking office, all facilities have been guided by the policy of glorious cooperation. In short, to promote a policy of cooperation and safeguard the honor and dignity of the country within the scope of the Franco-German armistice agreement. However, this policy has not been implemented as desired. The responsibility for this is not mine, and recent developments have made it even more necessary for me to request your approval to resign. It is hoped that the people of the country can see my departure as a manifestation of our fulfillment of our responsibility to save the country, thereby facilitating your work to overcome difficulties and allowing the country to maintain unity under your leadership." Marshal Pétain replied immediately, stating, "I have received your letter respectfully informing me of your request to resign from the position of Foreign Minister, and your intention is firm. I have no choice but to reluctantly approve it. Your appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs on December 14 last year was not originally due to your desire, but since taking office, you have been loyal to your duties and are highly commendable. This is another sacrifice for the country, and your noble spirit of disregarding gains and losses is worthy of praise, and not only I myself am grateful." (Havas, 9th)

Berlin - Well-informed sources in the German capital predict that former French Deputy Prime Minister Laval will soon be summoned to organize a new cabinet in the French government. The partial reorganization of the Vichy cabinet yesterday, with Commander Darlan as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, is only a temporary measure. The German government has insisted that Laval must control the French regime. This issue has been negotiated between France and Germany in Paris on many occasions. German newspapers reported last night that Laval's new government could be established today or tomorrow. Pétain will be the Head of State, and Laval will be the Prime Minister, in charge of all major powers. All members of the current cabinet, except for Darlan, Huntziger, and Commander-in-Chief of the French Army Barthelemy, will be dismissed. (United Press, 10th)

### Britain and Romania Sever Diplomatic Relations

London - The government announced today that Britain has formally severed diplomatic relations with Romania. (United Press, 10th)

London - According to official announcements, the British government has decided to withdraw its minister to Romania. (Reuters, 10th)

Rome - According to official sources, British Minister Sir Reginald Hoare informed the Romanian government this afternoon that he has requested the issuance of passports. He and his entire staff of fifty will return home by ship around February 15. (Reuters, 10th)

### German Aircraft Bomb Iceland; Several Ships Sunk in the Portuguese Sea; British Aircraft Obstructed in Attack on Northern Germany

Berlin - The German High Command recently stated that German aircraft made their first air raid on Iceland yesterday and strafed the British airfield in Reykjavik with machine guns. Another group of German aircraft bombed a British convoy 300 miles off the coast of Portugal. This was also the first time that German aircraft had bombed a convoy. German reconnaissance aircraft also reconnoitered Iceland. When German aircraft attacked the British convoy off the coast of Portugal, they sank 24,500 tons of British ships guarded by warships, and another four ships were also severely damaged. After the convoy was bombed, its formation was completely scattered. The High Command also stated that a single German aircraft sank a patrol ship off the coast of eastern Scotland and bombed targets in London and northeastern England. In an air battle over the Norwegian Sea, two British aircraft were shot down. German aircraft also destroyed four British barrage balloons. It also stated that British aircraft attacked two places in northwestern Germany, but only one farm was damaged. (United Press, 10th)

### International Anecdotes (4): The Evergreen Pétain

After this, he retired. Except for a brief period from February to November 1934, when he served as Minister of the Army in the Doumergue cabinet, he almost completely refrained from involvement in national military and political affairs.

If General Pétain had died peacefully at that time, his life could have been considered flawless. He was revered by the entire French people to an extent few others could match. Regardless of any military or political disputes within the country, he could maintain a detached position and remain uninvolved. Fate, however, propelled him from obscurity to become a world-renowned figure, and he did not fail to live up to the world's expectations.

He had a beloved woman, but because she was already married, they could not be together. Unexpectedly, at the age of sixty-four, he finally realized his wish, proving that lovers eventually find happiness. On September 14, 1920, he married Mrs. Hardon in Paris, only a few hours after announcing their engagement.

This old general was usually modest and unassuming, not wanting to draw attention to himself. He occasionally visited academic societies and authored the book "Defense of Verdun." Otherwise, his name was rarely heard.

Clemenceau had also praised him as having "excellent character." We should know that this "Tiger Premier" usually disliked military men. His discord with Foch was already well known. During the war, he had also complained about Pétain's procrastination and reluctance to take risks, as well as his excessive pessimism. However, in Clemenceau's last work, "Grandeur and Misery of Victory," he compared Pétain with other French generals, saying: Pétain is a great soldier. He has a bright future and always adheres to a steady and cautious approach. In dangerous battles, I found him very calm and brave, able to maintain composure in the face of the enemy. He has no illusions and never complains about others. He is always prepared to sacrifice himself. I am very pleased to praise him in this way. The world often blames him for the pessimistic tones issued by his headquarters staff, but I believe he has absolutely no fear. No matter what kind of adverse situation he encounters, he can remain calm and handle it with ease. However, the people around him inevitably believe rumors, giving others an opportunity to criticize. He himself is always a strong and unyielding great soldier.

We learned from Weygand that the construction of the Maginot Line was largely based on Pétain's proposal. Various specialized issues that the generals could not agree on were resolved by him one by one. This was a special achievement, sufficient to increase Pétain's reputation and authority. If he had retired from then on, enjoying his remaining years, he could have been called a complete man of his era.

Unexpectedly, in May 1935, due to the death of Polish President Marshal Piłsudski, Pétain represented the French government to attend the funeral. On the way to Warsaw, he stayed briefly in Berlin, and on the way back, he also made a stop in Vienna. He spoke with General Göring and other Nazi Party figures. They flattered the old French general and tried to persuade him by arguing that there was no real conflict between Germany and France. When he returned to Paris, Parisians were shocked to hear him praising German military figures. A year later, at the funeral of King Alexander of Yugoslavia, he met a group of Nazi officials and German military leaders again. This group of Germans repeated their old tricks and achieved significant success. At the same time, his dissatisfaction with French politics rapidly increased. Like most Frenchmen of his class, he saw communist and revolutionary colors in the Popular Front government.

On March 2, 1939, after Daladier signed a treaty with Franco's Spain, he sent the gray-haired old general to Burgos, the temporary capital of Spain, as ambassador, believing that Franco and Pétain had once been teacher and student, and that Pétain's prestige might win the welcome of the Spanish people. However, from the French point of view, Pétain achieved nothing during his tenure as ambassador to Spain. At the moment before France's defeat, Reynaud wanted to expel Gamelin and implement a far-reaching reform plan, but feeling that his qualifications were insufficient, he recalled Pétain to rally the people.

He knew that in the eyes of the French political and journalistic circles, and even the entire nation, the hero of Verdun, Pétain, was the only flawless man in French society, and his reputation was nothing less than a guarantee of victory.

The French have always taken pride in associating themselves with great military figures. At this time, Pétain had become the fading glory of the past, and everyone wholeheartedly yearned for him. Pétain's position and Hindenburg seemed to be on par. Before 1914, both were unknown figures. It was not until the outbreak of the Great War that they became famous overnight. When the war ended, they immediately retired, but in times of crisis, they stepped forward again, hoping to revitalize the central government and complete the restoration. However, things went against their wishes, and their plans often went wrong, proving that human effort is difficult to overcome fate. (The End)

### American Writer Carlson Visits Shanghai: Talks About China's Unyielding Spirit, Military and Civilians Full of Vitality, Transportation Construction Has Reached Modern Standards

American writer Carlson, who came to China last autumn for an investigation, traveled in the Chinese mainland for five months, traversing the southwestern provinces, covering more than four thousand miles. He recently departed from Chongqing by air to Hong Kong and returned to the United States on the President Cleveland. He returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. A reporter visited him at the hotel. According to him, his impression of China after half a year was excellent. He said that the Chinese people are loyal, resolute, and profound. With the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's talent and strategy, the fighting power is not to be underestimated. The overall situation in the future is optimistic.

Soldier Quality: Stronger with Each Battle

Carlson stated that the Chinese army has improved in both numbers and effectiveness compared to two years ago. He often came into contact with Chinese soldiers in the mainland. One day, he asked a soldier, "What does China need most now?" The soldier smiled and replied, "Nothing but final victory. We are fighting on the battlefield today, vowing to strive for victory with all our strength, because the final victory is the birth of a new China of freedom and democracy." It can be seen that the Chinese army is well-trained and confident, far superior to its opponents.

Full of Vitality, Unmatched in the World

This trip to the southwestern provinces of China provided a clear understanding and estimation of the various developments in China after the war. The people's patience and persistence, and the rapid progress in administrative efficiency, are astonishing. Although the various developments have not reached their peak, the rectification and improvement in this short period can be said to be unmatched in the world. The spirit of perseverance, diligent operation, outstanding spirit, and calm attitude give China vigorous vitality, hope, and guarantee China's survival and continuous development as a member of the world's democratic camp. All of this has left an indelible impression on my (Carlson's self-reference) mind.

Transportation Construction: Leaps and Bounds

The changes in Free China are so great that it is difficult for an outsider with a not-so-good impression of China to imagine. Highways connect various places, and transportation is extremely convenient, especially the construction of railways, which has made leaps and bounds, setting a record in the history of Chinese transportation. This can not only maintain close relations between China and foreign countries, allowing military supplies to be continuously imported, but also the spiritual mobilization is also worthy of attention. This kind of spiritual mobilization creates aspiring, responsible, and disciplined citizens, changes customs, cultivates the virtues of mutual assistance and mutual trust, and consolidates the foundation of Chinese society. In this regard, Madame Chiang's leadership and planning have made significant contributions.

Cooperative Movement: Deep into the People

Regarding the industrial cooperative movement in the Chinese mainland, Carlson highly praised it. Cooperatives are being established everywhere like mushrooms after the rain, and they have also been discovered in the occupied areas. All products are mostly made from local raw materials, and they are cheap and good, which are quite popular in the midst of rising prices. Therefore, the sales are extremely large. Achievements in refining gold, shipbuilding, shoe making, sugar refining, car manufacturing, soap making, and food production are excellent. The cooperative movement is the prelude to China's industrialization, leading China to the road of a modern country.

After Returning to the United States: Wide Dissemination

Carlson also said that this trip to China has a great mission, and he has a heavy responsibility for developing relations between China and the United States. No one in China and the United States can deny that they are the two major countries in the Pacific Ocean, and the combination of these two major forces is undoubtedly a guarantee of world culture. How many people in the United States can come to China or even travel in Free China? I have this opportunity now, so I should make good use of it. After returning home, I am willing to publicize what I have seen and heard to the people of the United States and urge the American people to meet China's needs in all aspects. I am confident that I will do my best to do so. Mr. Carlson took the original ship back to the United States at 10:30 yesterday morning. After landing in San Francisco, he will set off for various places in New York.

### Total Solar Eclipse Visible in the Yangtze River Basin: September 21

This year's solar eclipse on September 21st is a rare opportunity that is not easy to encounter for decades. Therefore, astronomers in this city are preparing to make precise observations at that time. In addition to Fujian Province, the entire eclipse can be seen in the Yangtze River basin. The initial eclipse time in the Yangtze River basin is: Xiangyang 12:59, Wuchang 12:08, Hankou 12:08, Dazhi 12:05, Jiujiang 11:59. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the initial eclipse time in Xining is 13:15, Lanzhou 13:05, Baoji 12:15, Shanyang 12:28, Chong'an 11:47, and Fuding 11:38.

### Board of Directors Election: British僑Selection Method Will Imitate American侨 Not Hold Primaries, Selection of Chinese Board Members Decided to Adopt Communication Methods

The election of the Board of Directors of the工部局 for this year is approaching. Due to the Japanese side's attempt to increase the number of Japanese directors and thus seek to control the工部局's administration, the election situation has become serious. Yesterday, it was learned that the工部局 has decided to follow the procedures stipulated in the Land Regulations for this year's Board of Directors election, as passed at the Board of Directors meeting on January 22nd.

Election Committee Continues to Exist

The Japanese side had requested the工部局 to amend the election procedures. The工部局 had organized an election committee composed of one member each from six countries with different nationalities, including Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Japan, and Germany, to study the issue. However, the election procedures cannot violate the provisions of the Land Regulations. Although there were slight amendments, it was largely the same as the previous election. The election committee was originally scheduled to be abolished, but it is now known that it will continue to exist. The工部局 has now completed the compilation of the taxpayer register. Judging from the number of election votes, the British and American sides still have the advantage.

British侨 Exchange Views on Selection

Since the American僑 candidates have already been determined, what can be noted is the action of the British and Japanese侨. However, the British side has the absolute advantage because of the support of the American侨. According to foreign sources, the reason for the delay in showing their position is that the American侨 Association resolutely determined the candidates, which is the number of two seats occupied by the directors. It is not like the past to double the number of people. It seems that there is no need to hold a primary election first. It is considered that it can be imitated. British侨 leaders are exchanging opinions these days, because the deadline for the工部局 to submit the list before noon on March 25th is still far away.

Chinese Taxpayers Election by Communication

Regarding the issue of Chinese directors, the unanimous opinion of Chinese taxpayers is to have Yu Qiaqing, Guo Shun, Chen Tingrui, Xi Yushu, and Yuan Ludeng re-elected, which is almost no problem. However, there is a saying that the method of production will be to convene a meeting of taxpayer representatives in two weeks to determine it. According to the investigation, it is clear that this statement is inaccurate, because there are more than 80 representatives scattered in various places, and it is difficult to gather in one place due to the situation. Therefore, the person in charge has already decided to adopt communication methods to determine the five Chinese directors. Since all parties are eager for the five to be re-elected, it is expected that the result of the selection will be largely unchanged.

### Resigned Deputy General Manager of the工部局, Karna, Returned to the United States Yesterday Morning, Many Famous Foreigners on the Same Ship, Journalist Gould Will Also Return Home

The American President Cleveland ship sailed out of the Huangpu River from Shanghai at 10:00 yesterday morning (10th) and sailed back to the United States for the 85th time. There were 119 passengers boarding the ship in Shanghai, including many famous foreigners in Shanghai, most of whom were going to the United States, such as Karna, the outgoing Deputy General Manager of the工部局, who will land in San Francisco, and Bai Luer, the manager of Yunfei Automobile Company, and his wife, who are going to Los Angeles. In addition, five family members of faculty and staff of St. John's University, who were evacuated back to the United States, also set off on the President Cleveland and will land in San Francisco.

Gould Will Return to the United States Soon

Yesterday, it was heard that Karna, the Deputy Manager of Mobil Oil Company in this city, who had served as the American Director and Deputy General Manager of the工部局, and Gould, the editor of the English Shanghai Evening Post, had resigned from the committee of the American侨 Association. Karna left Shanghai and returned to the United States on the President Cleveland yesterday morning (10th). Mr. Karna first came to China in 1911 and has served as the American Director of the工部局 four times. Gould's resignation from the committee of the association will take effect soon, because Mr. Gould plans to return to the United States for a visit. It was also heard that the vacancies left by the two people on the committee of the association have been filled by Pastor Lai Sai, the secretary of the American Bible Society, and Nikko, the manager of the American Insurance Company.

American僑婦孺 Continued to Leave Shanghai

American僑 in this city are still continuing to evacuate. Yesterday morning, the families of American professors at St. John's University in this city, including Mrs. Gao Sai, Mrs. Jin Hailisen, Mrs. Baushton, and Mrs. Qu Luopu, and more than a dozen people, as well as other American church pastors, all took the ship back to their country.

### Third Batch of American Red Cross Grain and Wheat Will Be Shipped to China Next Month

The American Red Cross's relief wheat and grain for Chinese disaster victims are continuously shipped to Shanghai by American mail ships. The Red Cross branch office here distributes them in the occupied areas along the滬寧 Line according to the guidelines designated by Dr. Baker. The first and second batches have been shipped. It is now known that the third batch of American relief wheat, 1,000 tons, will be shipped to Shanghai by the American mail ship Satar Tia at the end of next month. The ship belongs to the American Mail Ship Company and is managed by the Fulai Company. It is the first time to ship from the United States to Shanghai. It was also reported that the American Red Cross's relief wheat for Chinese disaster victims was detained by the Japanese in Shachong. The American Red Cross branch office here has not received a report, so this news cannot be confirmed.

### French Tram Workers Performed a Violent Drama Yesterday: "Trade Union" Swallowed the Bereavement Money of Dead Friends, Collecting "Membership Fees" Yesterday Caused Conflict

The French Concession's Lu Ban Road Xujiahui Road "French Water and Electricity Tram Company, at 2:30 yesterday morning, when distributing wages to workers in various departments, a newly formed tram workers' group last year sent people to the scene to collect membership fees from the workers. Because the union's accounts were unclear, it caused the workers to refuse and a dispute broke out, which turned into a violent drama. The details are as follows:

Forcibly Joined to Collect Membership Fees

The French Tram Company had a strike in November last year. After negotiations between labor and management, it took a month for the various conditions to be properly resolved and work resumed. The newly formed workers' group gained momentum during this strike and forced the workers to join the union, collecting membership fees from the workers. However, most workers were not used because they took care of their own interests. However, because they were in a bad situation, they reluctantly paid the membership fees, which was out of necessity.

Doing Nothing, Complaints

Recently, the workers have complained about the "trade union" collecting membership fees every month, doing nothing, and failing to fully reconcile labor and management. There was also a worker, Zhang Yongkang, who was injured and died in a conflict with the detective during the strike. All the workers raised 2,400 yuan and handed it over to the "trade union" to be handed over to Zhang's family as bereavement money, but Zhang's family only received 800 yuan.

Pocketing Huge Sums of Money, Unclear Accounts

After Chen Guohua, an inspector No. 5, was killed by workers for opposing the strike, 28 workers involved in the incident were arrested. All the workers raised 5,600 yuan and handed it over to the "trade union" to rescue and release them from the authorities, and to hand them over to the families of the arrested workers as living expenses. The "trade union" not only failed to rescue them, but also did not transfer the money to the families, and the union's various accounts have not been announced, which has caused dissatisfaction among all the workers.

Workers Question, Big Fight

Yesterday morning, the "trade union" sent three workers, Nos. 342, 298, and 160, to the entrance of the company to collect membership fees from the workers. Some workers opposed it and questioned the accounts of the trade union. At the same time, the mother of Zhang Yongkang, a dead worker, was also at the scene to prove that she had only received 800 yuan at the time. At this point, the three officials of the "trade union" who came to collect fees were speechless, and they were slapped in the face by the workers. The whole martial arts drama was launched.

The Company Reported the Arrest, Investigating Together

Upon receiving the information, the company immediately reported it to the French Police Station by telephone and immediately sent a large number of detectives to the scene. The three representatives of the "trade union" collecting fees, as well as No. 198, No. 152, and Zhang's mother, were taken to the police station for interrogation and investigation. On one side, the police station sent an armored car and a team of reserves to guard the company and the factory to prevent further incidents.

### Tax Reform Committee Holds First Meeting Today at the工部局

The Tax Reform Committee recently organized by the工部局 is scheduled to hold its first meeting in the工部局 Building today. According to a member of the committee, the first meeting of the committee will be to elect a chairman and discuss other organizations to advance the work. The工部局 has previously stated that the matters discussed by the committee are kept secret and will not be released to the outside world. The list of committee members is as follows: Zhong Si, Fan Keling, Hua Gangben, Mei Han, and Sun Ruihuang. If various groups and taxpayers wish to express their opinions to the committee, they can contact Mr. Glucker of the工部局.

Fairchild Talks About the Committee's Mission

Fairchild, the Director-General and General Manager of the工部局, met with a reporter from the North China Daily News the day before yesterday and made the following statement: The工部局 never directly responds to "Letters to the Editor" published in various newspapers. However, in this difficult period, it is unfortunate if the public is misled by false remarks. Your newspaper recently published a letter signed "Taxpayer" criticizing the工部局's appointment of a lawyer to study the tax issue as an inappropriate matter. This is the result of misrepresenting the facts. The small committee formed by the工部局 has nothing to do with the tax increase issue. What it is responsible for studying is only how to remedy the unfairness of the tax system. This issue is entirely within the scope of law and organization. The work of studying the source of tax revenue is undertaken by another committee that is completely unrelated to this, and its personnel are organized by businessmen from various countries, as the "taxpayer" hopes.

### Coolidge Ship Arrives in Shanghai Today

The American President Line's President Coolidge mail ship will arrive in Shanghai today from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Hawaiian Islands, Honolulu, and Kobe. The ship will berth at floats 11 and 12 and will carry a large amount of American mail to China, as well as a large amount of goods and livestock. The ship was originally scheduled to berth in Shanghai for only half a day and leave Shanghai southward late tonight at 11:00 for Hong Kong and Manila. However, the exact time of the ship's arrival in Shanghai was not announced until 6:00 yesterday evening. According to the company, the ship was originally scheduled to arrive this morning, but the ship has not yet telegraphed its itinerary. Therefore, it may not be possible to arrive this morning and must be postponed until this afternoon. It is now assumed that it will arrive at 3:30 this afternoon. The first batch of passengers will take a small boat to the New Customs Wharf to disembark. The departure time from Shanghai to Hong Kong at 11:00 tonight has also been changed, but the exact time will be determined after the ship telegraphs this morning.

### Rice Prices in Hong Kong Have Started to Fall, Rice Prices Are Back on Track, The工部局's Measures to Improve the Rice Market Will Be Implemented

The Rice Market Management Committee, in order to implement the intentions of the authorities, reorganize the industry's buying and selling rules, and eliminate all malpractices, held its 80th Market Management Committee meeting at the Yimao Lane Association in Shanhai Pass Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting and read the seven proposed measures to improve the rice market by the Public Concession工部局 one by one. Then, the discussion began. The attending committee members stood up and contributed their opinions. After the seven proposals were revised one after another, they were temporarily passed as resolutions and sent to the Shanghai Rice and Bean Industry Association for formal approval, and then announced to the market for strict implementation and reported to the two concession authorities for record.

Hong Kong Rice Prices Have Fallen

A rice dealer in this city telegraphed from Hong Kong that "Hong Kong's rice reserves have suddenly increased, the source is smooth, and rice prices have started to fall." Because Hong Kong rice is more convenient to transport to Shanghai than other ports, the rise and fall of rice prices in Hong Kong are greatly related to rice prices in the seven seas. According to past circumstances, whenever rice prices in Hong Kong fall, rice prices in this city will also fall at the same time. Therefore, rice prices in Hong Kong and Shanghai are closely linked.

Storage and Procurement are Being Carried Out

Various food groups in this city, in view of the heavy mission they bear, are actively procuring rice under the assistance of the two concession authorities and transporting it to Shanghai for regulation. It is now known that (1) the Rice Public Warehouse Management Committee is working hard to raise funds for storing 200,000 bags of rice. Those who have confirmed the amount of rice to be stored but have not paid the money are urging them to pay. It is heard that Yu Qiaqing's recognized 30,000 bags, half of which (15,000 bags) will arrive in port within a few days. (2) The last batch of 2,000 bags of rice ordered by the Food Regulation Association has also been loaded onto the "Fanlan" ship and arrived in Shanghai, and will be distributed to the 30th batch of Group C in the near future, and will be registered on a regular basis to continue ordering from overseas. (3) The first and second batches of rice ordered by the Food Cooperation Association, a total of 2,000 bags, have arrived one after another. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively participate so that they can continue to order and meet the purpose of regulating the food supply for the people.

### Dancing Girl Colludes with Gambling Den Teahouse to Entice Bangda Long Factory Director – Goods Worth 4,000 Yuan Robbed – Continued Extortion, Reported to Police, One Criminal Arrested

Ye Qide, who resides at No. 8, Lane 563, Connaught Road, used to work at the Central Bank of Hong Kong. While in Hong Kong, he met and cohabited with a dancing girl named Shen Meili. Later, Ye was transferred to the Kunming branch of the Central Bank, and Ye and Shen separated. Recently, Ye left the Central Bank and came to Shanghai, where he opened the Dalong Cotton Weaving Factory at No. 10, Public Security Lane, Xiaoshadu Road. On the afternoon of December 30th last year, at 2:00 PM, Shen Meili suddenly went to Ye Qide's residence with two men named Ye and Zhang, asking him to go to the Guangming Cafe for some refreshments. Ye agreed, and they hired a car together. Unexpectedly, Shen and the others instructed the driver to drive to a gambling den at the Sixth National Hotel on Haig Road. Zhang and others suddenly pulled out guns and threatened Ye Qide, ordering him to hand over 10,000 yuan in national currency. Ye refused because he had no money. Shen, Zhang, and Ye then forcibly took Ye Qide to the Dalong Factory and robbed him of 4,000 yuan worth of goods. Ye endured the pain and did not report to the police at the time. However, the Zhang surname (named Fang Daodao) repeatedly harassed Ye, forcing Ye to pay another 5,000 yuan before the matter could be settled. Ye, unable to bear the harassment, reported to the police and managed to arrest Zhang Fangdao (a teahouse worker at the Sixth National Hotel). Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police lawyer, Jiang, requested permission to detain Zhang because accomplices still needed to be apprehended. Judge Jiang verified the report and ordered Zhang to be detained pending further interrogation.

Commercial News

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Looks Weak – Millions of US Dollars Sold

The foreign exchange market yesterday showed no changes in the HSBC official rate. The unofficial markets for British and American currency accelerated their downward trend. This was because reports indicated that the United States would control foreign banks' deposits in the US, similar to freezing them. People were pessimistic, and speculators sold their holdings, reaching over one million US dollars throughout the day. Transaction prices ranged from 5.40625 yuan in the morning to 5.375 yuan in the afternoon when British banks like HSBC bought in, but this was temporary. As Jardine Matheson and others continued to sell, the closing prices were 3 shillings and 3.375 pence for British currency and 5.40625 yuan for US currency, a drop of 0.03125 and 0.0625 yuan respectively from last Saturday's closing prices. The futures market was similar.

Speculators Aggressively Sell on the Market

Early in the morning, the exchange rates between British and American currency and Shanghai were flat, with the American currency slightly higher against British currency and significantly higher against Shanghai currency. There was no market for French currency. The central bank's official rates for various currencies remained unchanged. When the banks opened for trading, the spot selling prices were 3 shillings and 3.34375 pence for British gold and 5.34375 yuan for US currency, the same as last Saturday's closing prices. The futures market opened with no changes either. After the opening, reports that the US Treasury Department would control foreign banks' deposits in the US, similar to a freezing plan, caused widespread pessimism and aggressive selling. Speculators sold about 800,000 US dollars, mostly purchased by a certain American bank, the British bank Macalley, and other foreign and Chinese banks. The price for February was 5.40625 yuan. HSBC's official rate was unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was not changed. Later, Chinese banks also came to sell spot US dollars, with Jardine Matheson buying in at 5.40625 yuan. Jardine Matheson then resold the February US dollars to a Chinese bank at the same price of 5.40625 yuan. By the afternoon, the situation stabilized somewhat, and the closing prices were 3 shillings and 3.375 pence for spot British currency and 5.40625 yuan for US currency.

Foreign Banks Still Buying In

Later, Nissin Bank also sold, and speculators continued to sell. Many Chinese banks followed suit, but HSBC and other British banks suddenly bought in, causing the February US dollar to rise from 5.40625 yuan back to 3.375 pence. However, as Jardine Matheson wanted to sell, the price of the current month's US dollar weakened again. The closing prices were 3 shillings and 3.375 pence for spot and current month British currency, and 5.40625 yuan for US currency. The prices for next month were 3 shillings and 3.359375 pence for British currency and 5.375 yuan for US currency, an increase of 0.03125 and 0.0625 yuan respectively compared to last Saturday's closing prices for British and American currency.

### Panic Selling Erupts – Gold Prices Plunge – Spot Prices Still 40-50 Yuan Higher Than Futures

Yesterday's unofficial market for cash gold saw a dramatic drop of up to 100 yuan. People's morale was extremely low. This was due to reports that the US Treasury Department would control foreign banks' deposits in the US, similar to a freeze. As a result, foreign exchange weakened, and the market opened below the 6,600 yuan mark at 6,570 yuan. Soon, panic selling erupted, first pushing the price down to the 6,500 mark. Bill dealers such as Xinfeng, Dafeng, Deji, and Hesheng all sold. Although there was some recovery, these sellers continued to sell, further lowering the price to a low of 6,490 yuan. The market closed at 6,498 yuan at noon. The market opened flat in the afternoon and then stabilized above 6,500 yuan due to a temporary recovery in the foreign exchange market. The closing price was 6,518 yuan, a decrease of 94 yuan from last Saturday's closing price. Cash transactions were active, and prices were relatively stable. Hengji sold 210 taels, Yongfeng sold 200 taels, Baokang sold 70 taels, and Yifeng sold 160 taels, all purchased by Chengji and Mingfeng at prices about 10 yuan higher than futures. Changji sold 100 taels of Tongkang Yong at 45 yuan higher. The price of ornaments was 10 yuan lower at 470 yuan. Customs gold and other items were generally flat.

Spot Gold Drops 94 Yuan

Early in the morning, the market opened at only 6,570 yuan due to negative news such as the US Treasury Department's control of foreign deposits, similar to a freeze. This was more than 40 yuan lower than the closing price on the previous weekend. After the opening, due to more supply than demand, the price was lowered by another 20 yuan to 6,550 yuan. Then, with purchases by Chengji and others, the price recovered by about 20 yuan to 6,575 yuan. Because foreign exchange was rising, bill dealers were eager to sell, and companies such as Hesheng, Xinfeng, Defu, Ren Cheng Yong put pressure on the price down to 6,515 yuan. Later, relying on Chengji to buy and Xiangxing and Yong to hold, the decline was stopped, pulling the price up to 6,540 yuan. However, Luo Xing found it difficult to maintain the high price, and the bill dealers sold frantically for a second time, breaking into the 6,500 yuan mark. Companies such as Dafeng, Hengji, and Deji sold, reaching a low of 6,490 yuan. Even at the noon closing, the price was only 6,498 yuan. The market opened flat in the afternoon at 6,495 yuan, but due to a temporary recovery in the foreign exchange market supported by HSBC and others, Defu, Gonghe, and Yida bought in, pushing the price to 6,545 yuan. However, Tongkang Yong sold at the high price, pushing it back down to 8,505 yuan. Before the closing, retail investors shouted to buy, reaching 6,518 yuan at the closing, a decrease of 94 yuan compared to last Saturday's closing price. The market was stronger after the closing, with成交 at 6,530 yuan. The price of wooden sign gold from cash shops was about 60 yuan higher than the spot gold price. Purchases were 40 yuan lower than sales. There was still no price for the current marked gold.

Gold Pounds Fall by Two Yuan

The British gold then tended to stabilize, and the market price remained flat. The price of American gold notes gradually declined, falling from 18.38 yuan to 18.2 yuan, a drop of 0.22 yuan compared to last Saturday. The supply of Hong Kong notes was slightly strong, and the market price tended to be weak. The demand for Japanese gold notes was still strong, reaching a high of 1.715 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes tended to weaken, retreating to 1.315 yuan in the evening market.

### Simple Method for Calculating Interest on Current Deposits

— Fan Shunchang

There are banks that settle interest on current deposits monthly, and some that settle every six months. The method is to multiply the sum of the gross interest (i.e., accumulated amounts) for one month or six months by the interest rate (weekly interest) and then divide by 365 to obtain the exact amount of interest. This is the common and general method, but it is not only too cumbersome, but also time-consuming and prone to errors. Here is a simple method that only requires multiplying the sum of the accumulated amounts by a "fixed number" to obtain the actual amount of interest. This fixed number is 1.7397 when the annual interest rate is 1%, 5.4794 when the annual interest rate is 2%, and so on, with the fixed number being twice the corresponding 1% rate. If using a calculator, simply set the "fixed number" as the "multiplicand" and the total accumulated amount for each depositor as the "multiplier," which will be more convenient, faster, and more accurate. The principle is also quite simple: when the interest rate is 1% per year (weekly interest), assuming the gross interest (i.e., accumulated amount) is 36500, then the interest is exactly 1 yuan. In other words, when the weekly interest is 1%, assuming the gross interest (i.e., accumulated amount) is 10000, then the interest is exactly 0.273 yuan. The formula is as follows:

This 0.273 yuan is the "fixed number" when the annual interest rate is 1%. If the annual interest rate is 2%, simply multiply by 2 to get a "fixed number" of 0.547, and so on for the rest.

Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market's Sentiment Suddenly Turns Negative – Large Bullish Holders Painfully Liquidate Positions – Shuangma Yarn Plunges by 40 Yuan

The yarn market has fallen sharply, and the situation is relatively weak. This is because the foreign exchange has increased in value and gold has fallen, causing market sentiment to turn negative. General speculation has only made matters worse. The market situation often exaggerates both rises and falls, creating a terrifying situation. Securities companies are actively involved in buying and selling, creating a lively scene. According to the market, large industry players remain calm and will wait for real sales to develop before determining their strategy. The market price of 20-count Shuangma yarn is 1,486 yuan, with the lowest price being 1,441 yuan. In the afternoon, it began trading at 1,435 yuan, followed by 1,443 yuan. Today, 20 pieces of yarn are being shipped to Siam.

The Shuangma market opened in the morning with a relatively mild atmosphere, but there was a lack of new buyers in the market. The initial price was 1,486 yuan. At this time, the situation became more hesitant as there were too many bullish purchases from the previous day. As a result, a reversal occurred, and the decline became even more severe, dropping slightly to 1,475-6 yuan. After a brief rebound, news of falling gold prices and weakening foreign exchange caused a sudden surge in selling pressure in the market. Large speculators and bullish holders painfully liquidated their positions. Small investors, seeing that the market was weakening, became alarmed, and the market shrank further, falling directly to 1,443 yuan. The closing price was 1,441 yuan. The total volume of成交 in half a day was 7,940 bales. The price of 10-count Shuangma yarn fell by 40 yuan. The amount purchased by each company is listed below.

### Factory Buying Halted – Cotton Market Weakens Greatly

The current cotton situation is declining along with the yarn market. The market is weak, and all business is sluggish and inactive. In reality, factories have already purchased a lot. However, given the poor performance of yarn prices and the severe decline in雑牌 yarn, there is no longer any intention to buy raw materials. Therefore, the cotton market is very weak. In the New York cotton market, the price initially fell due to the selling by Southern companies, but then rebounded due to buying by industry players and short covering. As a result, the closing price was slightly higher by 2-3 points than the previous day's closing price.

Indian cotton is flat, and predictions are about half a rupee higher.

Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai has been sluggish due to the inferior situation in the yarn market and the gradual decline in yarn prices. All parties remain hesitant and are waiting for a good opportunity to emerge. Therefore, the market has been quiet in recent days, and prices have also weakened slightly. However, local cotton stocks are not high, and factories will still need to buy raw cotton in the future.

### Piece Goods: Cloth Prices Too High, Frequent Declines

The factory cloth market continued to decline yesterday due to the disastrous drop in yarn prices, which scattered market sentiment. Speculators rushed to sell, while real buyers were hesitant to buy, resulting in a lack of sales. As a result, selling prices continued to decline. Fugui fine cloth opened at 44 yuan, then sold for 43.5 yuan, and fell another 0.5 yuan in the afternoon. The result was a drop of 1 yuan per piece. Other grades of fine cloth and twill also fell by nearly 1 yuan. Coarse cloth fell by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan. The opening prices for bleached and dyed cloth were chaotic, and they also fell by about 1 yuan per piece. Total成交 in this street was about 300 pieces of cloth, with actual sales even more sparse, limited to small amounts of urgently needed goods.

Eastern cloth fell sharply yesterday as real sales were weak and retail investors tended to sell. The leading white cloth, a fine cloth, opened at 49.1 yuan and declined linearly, falling to 47.2 yuan. The market closed slightly higher at 47.6 yuan at noon, but the aftermarket remained weak, trading at 47.45 yuan. Futures on the "Exchange" also fell sharply. The closing prices in the afternoon were 47.9 yuan for February, 49.3 yuan for March, 50.065 yuan for April, and 51.55 yuan for May.

Today, 800 pieces of export piece goods were shipped to Tianjin, 19 pieces to Xiamen, 435 pieces to Hong Kong, 110 pieces to Siam, 19 pieces to Rangoon, and 100 pieces to Yantai.

### Foodstuffs: Successive Arrivals of Foreign Rice Orders; Abandoning Saigon for Rangoon Alleviates Food Worries; Speculators Still Trying to Manipulate, But Market Remains Unmoved

Yesterday morning, as the rice market opened, sellers again tried to manipulate prices, shouting loudly, but the market remained sluggish. Regardless of retail or wholesale customers, they were wary of abundant inventories and uninterrupted supplies, so inquiries were scarce. This left sellers unable to manipulate prices, and they adapted by loosening their grip again, but demand remained weak. As a result, the market seemed to collapse, with prices for various foreign rice varieties dropping steadily, without any sign of rebound. By the close, prices had fallen by 50 cents to one yuan per shi, compared to the previous week. Grade 1 new Saigon rice was only 81.5 to 80.08 yuan; Grade 2 was 77.8 to 76 yuan; Grade 1 Siam Special was 82 yuan; the general market was 80 yuan; old rice was offered at 80 jiao wu; medium rice was 78 yuan; first-grade Huojiao Special was 81.5 yuan down to 79 yuan; small Huojiao was 74 wu, down to 71.5 yuan for Pudong pier rice; large Huojiao was 71.7 yuan, 71.5 yuan; Tokyo polished rice was 72 yuan; rice tea was 70 yuan; broken polished rice was 66 yuan down to 60 yuan. For futures, new Dingtong futures were quoted, and foreign firms continued to hawk them. Yesterday, it was confirmed that Shenji sold 8,000 tons of February small Huojiao rice to public warehouses at a price of 86.78 yuan. Also, Heyi offered broken rice at a price of 17.5 yuan. Currently, with favorable exchange rates, sentiment is particularly weak. Futures for current delivery of bagged small Huojiao rice were 87 to 86.35 yuan; February delivery was around 87.5 to 87 yuan; February delivery for Grade 2 Saigon rice was 90 yuan.

As for thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice varieties, although there were rumors of continued smooth supply, this has yet to be confirmed, and arrivals remain scarce. Consequently, sellers are reluctant to sell cheaply, leading to sluggish business and little change in the market. Changbang Yuan Special white japonica rice is still offered at 106 yuan, with a market price of 102 yuan per hu; Kunshan Yuan white japonica rice is 104 yuan, with a market price of 101 yuan down to 96 yuan; Qingjiao market price for thin paddy rice is 94.7 yuan, 94.3 yuan; Yuan Zheng is 97.8 yuan, 97.5 yuan.

Glutinous rice continues to see sluggish retail sales, and sellers are also scarce, resulting in a flat market with neither gains nor losses. Hong Kong white rice is offered at 80 to 78 yuan.

The supply of foreign rice is very strong. Jardine Matheson's ship, the "Fusheng", arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 9th), carrying 1,339 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Swire Company's ship, the "Sichuan", also arrived the day before yesterday, carrying 2,492 bags also from Hong Kong. Rangoon small Huojiao rice is usually transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai. For convenience, rice merchants previously discussed with certain shipping companies about sending ships to Rangoon to load and transport the rice directly. Details were previously reported in the newspaper. It is now learned that this small Huojiao rice will arrive in Shanghai successively. Yesterday, the French firm Xia Laochen Foreign Firm's manager's "St. Vinceil de Paul" (Yongzhen) ship arrived from Rangoon with 1,700 tons, about 17,000 bags. After arriving yesterday morning, it docked at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. Also, the British ship "Shinai" arrived from Rangoon with 3,400 tons, about 34,000 bags, arriving in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. Several other ships are also expected to arrive. (Zu)

### Lack of Buyers for Foreign Flour

Yesterday, the flour market remained weak, mainly because sales to Japanese customers continued to decline, and it was rumored that 200,000 to 300,000 bags of previously ordered foreign flour would arrive in Shanghai around the 20th, with subsequent shipments arriving continuously. Furthermore, a ship of wheat ordered by the Wenwen Fuxin mill has also arrived, and cheap flour supply is gradually increasing, leading to weak sentiment. Current transactions in foreign flour are very slow, with only local customers occasionally buying a little over 1,000 bags. Brand flour is priced at 24.4 yuan, down another 30 cents from last weekend. With limited trading prospects, the market is even weaker. In-transit goods and February-March futures are being offered at very accommodating prices, but there are no substantial buyers, resulting in a further drop of 20 to 30 cents compared to before. Around 2,000 bags were traded. The flat-priced flour from Chinese mills remains unchanged, and mill quotations are not being lowered for the time being. Today, 500 bags of flour are being shipped to Xiamen.

Yesterday, the wheat market was dull and unremarkable. The Chinese flour mills have recently received over 7,000 tons of Australian foreign wheat. They are not keen on domestic wheat. The purchase prices at the Japanese mills' storefronts also remain unchanged, and the market remains stagnant.

### Soybean Cake Speculators Unleashed

Yesterday's soybean cake market was initially stable in the morning due to firmer oil prices. However, in the afternoon, there was a sudden change as some long positions took profits and exited the market, and the overbought market struggled to hold up. Selling pressure was strong, and prices fell frequently, ultimately dropping by one or two jiao compared to last week. Specifically, Xingji current cakes were 500 pieces, with prices as per the market price. 12,000 pieces for March upper delivery, 15,000 pieces for March lower delivery, and 15,000 pieces for April delivery were sold. Yuanlong current cakes were one cartload, two cartloads for February lower delivery. Feizi brand cakes were five cartloads for March upper delivery, and Lizi brand cakes were 5,000 pieces for February lower delivery. Today, 1,420 bags of soybeans and 295 cans of raw oil are being shipped to Xiamen, and 7,240 pieces of soybean cake and 5,000 cans of raw oil are being shipped to Hong Kong.

### Government Bonds Flat and Weak

The off-market trading of government bonds remained sluggish yesterday. Type A bonds, after deducting the lottery winnings, showed a sharp decline of 9 jiao, and the trend has entered a consolidation phase. Although buying interest was quite active, many long positions were exiting the market, and spot goods continued to flow out. The difference between Types C and E on Saturday was only 1.4 yuan, but today it is several yuan. The reason for this is that the number of lottery tickets drawn in the 11th drawing increased from 8 to 18 for Type C, and from 8 to 12 for Type E. The difference in lottery drawing rights is 6. Previously, Types C and E always moved in the same direction, but from the 11th drawing onwards, they gradually diverged, and the divergence is accelerating, hence this phenomenon. Yesterday, both buyers and sellers were not very active, and market price fluctuations were minimal. Lianyi, Renchang, Yitai, and Datong were buying, while Hongda, Tongkang, and Xinfu consistently took profit, and Runli and Yizhong were also selling. The situation has not shown any improvement. As a result, market prices fell slightly by 2 to 3 jiao to 9 jiao, except for Type B, which did well with an increase of 3 jiao. Type C bonds fluctuated, while Type A bonds fell more due to the lottery drawing. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.

In stock trading, 100 shares of Salt Industry Bank stock were traded at a price of 121 yuan, it is said.

The industrial and commercial stock market was gloomy all day, but the underlying trend remained stable. However, near the close, upon hearing that the foreign exchange market had tightened, sentiment suddenly improved, and International, British & Federated, Wheelock, and Ewo Cotton Mill saw very active trading. Jardine Matheson's shares also closed firm.

### Coal: Sharp Drop in Indian Coal Prices

Recently, the supply of Indian bituminous coal has suddenly increased. Yesterday, a certain foreign firm received another order for 3,000 tons. Brokers generally have goods on hand, causing speculators to sell, and prices have plummeted. Industry quotations show lump coal selling for only 232 yuan. Old orders may still be discounted. Local distributors are selling screened lump coal at 250 yuan per ton delivered to customers, it is said.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Market Downstream

Yesterday, the sugar market saw a downturn, with prices falling by 7 to 8 jiao to several jiao. The association's quoted prices for spot goods are: current delivery of Grade 2 coarse white Ben pier rice is 80.9 yuan, down 7 jiao; February end delivery is 81 yuan, foreign pier rice is 80.06 yuan, down 4 jiao; Dutch red sugar is 63.5 to 63 yuan, down 7 jiao; Taikoo's B mark white sugar at the West pier is 80.5 to 80.2 yuan, down 8 jiao; DY mark is 78.2 yuan, HX mark is 78 yuan, down 3 jiao. There were 305 bags arriving from Hong Kong yesterday.

### North-South Goods: Sichuan Fungus Up Another 25 Yuan

Due to the lack of continuous supply of Sichuan wood ear fungus, sellers have very high expectations, and demand from Southeast Asia is quite active, so prices continue to rise. Yesterday, it was heard that off-market trading quoted 20 bags of Yongji Sichuan fungus at 650 yuan, up another 25 yuan.

### Metals: High Prices and Sluggish Sales of Tinplate

Since the manufacturer Tainiu changed its tinplate operation to a company, it has immediately felt its resources are thin. Furthermore, business from out-of-town customers has been inactive for a long time. The only thing that can enliven the market is business from a few egg factories, but the volume is not large. Therefore, the market appears very sluggish, and quoted prices are quite high, so buyers are hesitant to make purchases, leading to even more sluggish sales. Wholesale transactions are insignificant. Yesterday's market prices were: 100-pound double-joined American tinplate at 300 yuan per box, 90-pound double-fast at 270 yuan per box.

### Recent Developments at the National Peiping Library: Rare and Unique Secret Books Acquired; Microfilm Books Produced

In recent months, the National Peiping Library has acquired many rare and unique secret books that are rarely seen in the world. The production of microfilm books is described below. (A) Rare Books Acquired: (1) "A Record of Military Affairs in Southern Anhui" (Wan Nan Jun Wu Ji Lue), one volume, with "A Commoner's Service in the Army" (Pi Fu Cong Rong Shi Yi), one volume, written by Chen Zhongxiu, Qing Guangxu edition, with his own account of serving in the suppression of bandits during the Xianfeng period, is excellent material for studying the history of the Taiping Rebellion. (2) "A Brief Account of Celebrated Figures in Nanjing during the Ming Dynasty" (Dili Mingdai Renwen Lue), twelve volumes, with "Editorial Principles" (Dingji Dayi), one volume, and "Appendix" (Fu Lu), one volume, written by Lu Hongxiu of the Qing Dynasty, Daoguang movable-type edition. Hongxiu, who called himself Qingyan Yisou, was a former Ming Dynasty descendant in Nanjing. This book was completed during the Kangxi period, describing figures in Nanjing during the Ming Dynasty. It was first printed in movable type by Gan Xujin in Daoguang Gengxu. After the Hong Yang Rebellion, only this copy remains. (3) "Annals of Nan'ao" (Nan'ao Zhi), twelve volumes, edited by Qi Chong during the Qing Dynasty, Qianlong edition. Nan'ao is one of the islands in the East China Sea of Raoping County, Guangdong. During the Qing Dynasty, Nan'ao Town was established and troops were stationed there. Later, it was placed under the jurisdiction of Wenzhou Prefecture. This book was written before the establishment of the Subprefecture and can be called a secret book. (4) "Annals of Gushan" (Gushan Zhi), twelve volumes, compiled by the monk Yuanxian of the Qing Dynasty, Shunzhi edition. (5) "Annals of Yunmen Xiansheng Temple" (Yunmen Xiansheng Si Zhi), sixteen volumes, compiled by Zhao Dian of the Qing Dynasty, Shunzhi edition. (6) "Annals of Ruian Xianyan Temple" (Ruian Xianyan Si Zhi), ten volumes, compiled by Zhulin Foyan and Yuntan Fanzhi, Kangxi edition. The above books are all from the collection of the Baoging Building of the Lu family in Siming and are rarely seen in the world. (7) "Annals of Huaiyu Mountain" (Huaiyu Shan Zhi), ten volumes, compiled by Zhu Chengxu of the Qing Dynasty, Kangxi edition (located in Yushan County, Jiangxi). (8) "Annals of Yuelin Temple in Ming County" (Mingxian Yuelin Si Zhi), eight volumes, written by Dai Mingcong of the Qing Dynasty, Kangxi edition (five li north of Fenghua County). (9) "A Brief Account of Tianjing Temple" (Tianjing Si Zhilue), six volumes, compiled by the monk Tong of the Qing Dynasty, early Qing Dynasty edition (Tianjingshan, southwest of Huai'an County). (10) "Annals of Zhiti Temple" (Zhiti Si Zhi), six volumes, compiled by the monk Zhaowei of the Qing Dynasty, Kangxi edition (Zhiti Mountain, Ningde County, Fujian). (11) "Annals of Dayun Temple on Hao Hill" (Haoshan Dayun Si Zhi), two volumes, compiled by Zhang Nie of the Qing Dynasty, Kangxi edition (Haoshan, ninety li east of Qinshui County, Shanxi). (12) "Annals of Xixi Fan Yin" (Xixi Fan Yin Zhi), four volumes, written by Wu Bentai of the Qing Dynasty, Daoguang edition (describing the scenic spots of Qiantang). (13) "Gazetteer of Tibet" (Xizang Zhi), traditionally written by Prince Guo, Qianlong edition, secretly obtained in Chengdu, and first circulated in the world. (14) "Ten Proposals for Chaoyang" (Chaoyang Shi Yi), one volume, and "Eight Proposals for Gukang" (Gugang Ba Yi), one volume, written by Ma Wanlin of the Ming Dynasty, Wanli edition, which contains the proposals made by Wanlin when he was an official in Chaoyang and Gucheng counties regarding disaster relief, military reclamation, taxes, unjust prisons, and charitable granaries. In addition, many Ming editions of family trees were purchased, such as: (zi) "Genealogy of the Wang Suojin Family in Xin'an Xiuning" (Jiajing Edition), five volumes. (chou) "Draft Genealogy of the Zhao Family of Dagang" (Jiajing Edition) (the lineage is recorded from the Song Dynasty's Xianyuan Yudie and includes biographies of Zhao Zhongding Gong and other Song Dynasty clansmen written by Song people, which is very helpful for historical research; a fine manuscript written in blue ink on cotton paper). (yin) "Genealogy of the Dai Family of Jixi" (Jiajing Edition), six volumes, one additional volume at the beginning. (mao) "Genealogy of the Wu Family" (Ming Edition) (each biography is accompanied by a tomb map, which is a unique feature in genealogical records). (chen) "A Record of Famous Families in Xin'an Xiuning" (Ming Edition), two volumes (recording the evolution of famous families in Xiuning, which is the same as the Xin'an Family History held in the library). These are all rare secret books. (B) Microfilm Books Produced: The books in the library are being photographed on microfilm, which was invented by the Frenchman Decolon. Rare and precious books can be disseminated through this, which is beneficial to scholars. A 200-foot roll of film can hold 6,400 pages of books and only costs US$5. When reading, a projector is used to view the films, and a colored light shines through the film and projects the image onto a frosted glass screen, similar to a slide show. It is also equipped with a button for easy page turning. The library recently received a donation of such a camera from the United States. Due to the convenience of using the facilities of the Peiping Union Medical College Power Plant, the camera has been temporarily installed in the hospital. During this period of war, the transportation and distribution of printed materials is difficult. The invention of this microfilm book production process is very low in cost and very small in size, making airmail especially convenient. Large quantities of books can be widely disseminated through this means. In the future, the books held by various libraries in Peiping can be reproduced to provide research materials for academic institutions in the interior.

### School News

Shanghai Women's Supplementary School: The Shanghai Women's Practical School is specifically designed for out-of-school adult women and girls preparing for further education. Therefore, all subjects that ordinary primary and secondary schools should have, as well as the knowledge and skills necessary for family and society, such as Chinese, English, arithmetic, abacus, general knowledge, bookkeeping, banking accounting, Mandarin conversation, English conversation, sewing, embroidery, piano, and typing, etc., are divided into levels according to proficiency and into morning and afternoon classes according to time. Dormitories are also available. Most of the textbooks are self-compiled, and the teaching methods are conscientious. The spring semester is scheduled to begin on February 12. Tuition fees remain the same. The school's first campus is located at 54 Hualong Road, and the second campus is located at 630 Baker Road.

Fifth China Vocational Supplementary School: The Fifth China Vocational Practical School, located at Nanjing Road, Shilu East, has consistently ranked at the top in individual and group competitions for bookkeeping, calligraphy, Chinese, and English organized by the China Vocational Education Society. This year's spring class began yesterday. In view of those who are ambitious but unable to afford to attend school, a special economic class has been established. In addition, "Mencius" and "The Analects" are added to the Chinese classes at all levels, without increasing tuition fees.

### Published as Received

We have learned that our school has a total of 22 male and female teachers this semester. On the 3rd of this month, only three female teachers used class-striking means to force the hiring of two substitute teachers, Xu Heng and Wu Tianjing, from last semester. Substitute teachers have no contractual relationship and are not subject to mediation. Moreover, the original teachers had already arrived at school for class. What is meant by going back on one's word? Unexpectedly, the three female teachers did not achieve their goal, causing a disturbance. Tang, a member of the school board, and those involved in education, intervened to mediate. Tang introduced and hired one substitute teacher, Xu Heng, and stipulated that the two female teachers arrive at school at 1:00 PM on the 8th, and the others had nothing to do with the dispute. Corresponding letters were sent. Xingzhong Primary and Secondary School

### Goods That Cannot Be Sold Out

— Editor

A junior high school graduate, due to poverty at home, had to drop out of school and become a primary school teacher. He wrote a letter filled with grief and indignation, saying: "Being a primary school teacher is simply selling knowledge, isn't this very terrible? I worry that perhaps after being a primary school teacher for a few years, the knowledge I have acquired in my life will be sold out. Then wouldn't I become an empty skull?"

We, of course, deeply sympathize with the situation of this friend, but I think his point of view is incorrect. In this era of commodification of education, being a teacher may be said to be "selling knowledge", but knowledge is different from ordinary commodities. Ordinary goods, after being sold, leave you with nothing, but knowledge, after being sold, is obtained by the customer, and you do not suffer any loss. Not only is there no loss, but if you can make good use of the teaching opportunities, you can also gain a lot of knowledge from teaching.

So I feel that knowledge can never be sold out, and it will not make people become an "empty skull". I think knowledge is a beautiful gift between people. It benefits the recipient greatly, while causing no loss to the giver.

Human knowledge has been accumulated in the process of giving and receiving. This is the inheritance we have received from our ancestors, and we will pass on this even greater inheritance to our descendants.

We should be as generous as possible with the giving of knowledge.

### The Lanterns of Nature

— Jian

The love of light is a common instinct among animals. Especially humans, when encountering festivals, elaborately decorate with lanterns. In fact, lower animals often have similar arrangements, many of which are extremely wondrous, beyond the imitation of humans who pride themselves as the spirit of all things. Now, let's pick a few that resemble our decorations to discuss.

Silver Flower Tree

"Tang Dynasty poet Su Weidao wrote: 'Fire trees and silver flowers combine, starlight and orange keys unlock.'" The most common decoration for lantern festivals is, of course, the fire tree. We also find the branching coral tree in the sea: it usually emits various colorful electric lights throughout, and the light spots are bizarre and ever-changing. Now, let's quote the description of French deep-sea explorer Marquis de Foiin to get a glimpse: "From the main branches of all corals, the most brilliant flames shoot out, sometimes strong, sometimes weak, indescribable: changing from light purple to deep purple, from red to orange-yellow, from light blue to various shades of green, sometimes white-hot like burning iron. The common light is light green, other colors only occur occasionally, and quickly return to green. When the light is at its brightest, one can stand six yards away and still distinguish the finest print on a newspaper." Today, let me forcibly call the coral tree a silver flower tree.

Decorated Archway

In the tropical forests near the equator, millions of fireflies breed. When they gather tightly, one after another, on the branches of trees, they compete to emit brilliant blue or light green cold light at night. Suppose we move these branches to the entrance of a shop, wouldn't it be a perfect decorated archway? Furthermore, suppose we arrange these branches horizontally and vertically under the ceiling of a room, wouldn't they be some exquisite flower garlands?

Fireworks Display

The above describes the static state of fireflies. Unfortunately, if a gust of wind comes, or a tired bird returns to its nest, shaking the branches, then you can see these millions of small bright spots flying in all directions; some make curved lines, some make straight lines, some revolve in circles, like flames shooting upwards, like shooting stars scattering. A Frenchman named Caxueray, who once traveled to Ecuador, praised it as having magical and inimitable fireworks!

Celebration Fleet

Usually, warships or large postal ships are fully decorated with hundreds of thousands of brilliant electric lights during celebrations. Unexpectedly, the sea also has countless small warships that are constantly celebrating. For example, a fish called Gonostoma, about ten inches long, has two rows of evenly arranged light organs under its abdomen, from head to tail. The upper row emits green, blue, and light purple colors, and the lower row emits red, orange-yellow, or light purple colors. There is also a type of fish found in the deep sea southwest of Ireland: not only does it have two rows of bright electric lights under its abdomen, but it also has a wide luminous triangular band and countless glittering stars on its body. There are many, many other fish. Suppose we compare the images of these fish with the photos of warships celebrating, taken by newspaper reporters, we can see that the two are strikingly similar.

Neon Lights

These three words are too common and lack a definite style to be compared. We can say that any luminous animal is a kind of neon light. Neon lights have many appearances, and luminous animals have even more. Let's just mention one or two. Fireflies are blue neon lights, brittle stars are green neon lights, and a species called Salpes is red neon lights. There is a squid with twenty light organs: "like luminous jewels, either deep blue, deep red, sky blue, or silver." Let's call it a color-changing neon light for now!

Sea of Perpetual Night

In conclusion: on the rocks of the deep sea, there are many kinds of fixed animals, all of which can emit various colorful electric lights to compete for beauty, such as sea pens, sea lilies, sea anemones, sea stars... We can call this place an underwater city. Various animals that come to this city to sightsee, play, rob, and deceive also carry their own electric lights. (Some kinds of fish use a very long stalk to hold a light in front of their foreheads, which seems very convenient for walking!) Thus, the dark seabed has become a "sea of perpetual night"!

### Passion

— Jianfeng

In the depression of the past few days, I wrote an angry letter to a close friend far away. Today, her reply has arrived, and through my tearful eyes, I seem to see her firm face and clenched fists. I can't help but straighten my chest, and the tears have dried. Her letter tells me: "Living in this era, darkness spreads everywhere; but on the other hand, the light that overcomes darkness is also growing. Why don't you broaden your horizons? "Death, I have thought about it before, but in today's position, how easy is it to talk about death? The environment certainly makes you heartbroken, but in another corner, justice and fairness also exist in this world. For this, can you bear to give up? Don't be too pessimistic! Even though some people are doing despicable and obscene things, as long as we bury ourselves in hard work, are we still afraid that the day of purification will not come? There is absolutely no despair in the world. With great oppression, there must be even greater liberation. We are connected, clenching our fists, and the evil forces will eventually be crushed. Let the light of struggle shine through tearful eyes, and let unwavering faith come from a hesitant heart! Take life seriously, and watch less works that make people depressed. I believe what I say is correct. Work diligently, without a moment of slack, then joy will surely belong to you. Finally, I hope that in your next letter to me, you can sincerely tell me: "I must live meaningfully! I must live strongly!" I began to be silent, a force burning my passion; yes, I feel that I should live more heroically! Life is beautiful.

### Begonia

— Tai Shouou

"Hey, Third Brother! How much money would it cost to run a girls' school like this?" He couldn't help but ask Military Governor Hu.

Military Governor Hu knew his intentions and was afraid that if he didn't stop him, he might ask even more unpleasant questions, so he hurriedly gave him a wink, while trying to suppress his voice and answer:

"Let's discuss it when you really want to run it?"

But after only four or five minutes of silence, Garrison Commander Yuan couldn't bear it anymore.

"Old Hu, don't you think the fifth one in the third row is so delightful?"

Military Governor Hu could only shake his head vigorously, ignoring him.

"Wow! There's a good one in the seventh row too!" Yuan Baofan still widened his lustful eyes, trying his best to hunt for objects that could satisfy his high degree of lasciviousness among those young girls.

After a round of applause, the provincial governor slowly walked down from the podium, and Director Hong of the Department of Education stood in a corner of the auditorium, loudly shouting the words "Guest Speech." Among the guests present today, Garrison Commander Yuan was of course the highest-ranking. Principal Hou specially walked up to him and said respectfully.

"Please, Garrison Commander Yuan, say a few words."

This really stumped Garrison Commander Yuan! He could scold people in public, and even sing a few out-of-tune Beijing operas on the street when he was drunk without caring; but asking him to go on stage and give a speech in a proper manner was something he had no hope of doing in this lifetime! And even if he had always been able to give speeches, he wouldn't want to today; because he wanted to "look at women." Sitting in the guest seat, he could indulge in watching them, but stepping onto the podium, he would have to say a few words, and his eyes would be restricted.

"No way! I just came here to have fun with everyone. If you want someone to speak, let Old Hu give another speech!" he replied incoherently.

An old virgin who had little contact with society simply couldn't understand such words, and Principal Hou was almost too embarrassed to retreat.

"Principal Hou, Garrison Commander Yuan doesn't like to talk, so let someone else go up!" Military Governor Hu, who was also from the military but had some education, immediately interjected, thus breaking the deadlock. (Twenty-seventh)

### A Soul-Stirring Bell

— Guoguo

First Place in the Social Category

(1)

The monumental film "Confucius," produced in a solemn working process, has indeed added a vibrant energy to today's film scene.

Although Mr. Fei Mu modestly said: "This film is 'far from accurate historical facts'," "Please do not think that Confucius's life story is like this'," "Please do not regard it as orthodox history'."... But he specially selected several fragments of Confucius's life that have contemporary significance, emphasizing Confucius's "struggling spirit of not being corrupted by wealth and power, not being moved by poverty and lowliness, and not being subdued by force." Not only is the viewpoint correct, but what the environment requires of the "Confucius" film is precisely this.

In the "scene by scene," "inch by inch" of the screen, filled with a quiet atmosphere, gradually unfolds an impassioned, tragic, and heroic story. After watching the "Confucius" film, the tide of feelings surges, how can these short thousand words encompass it!

Let us praise this soul-stirring bell, it not only awakens the righteousness of the world, but also shatters the courage of "rebellious ministers and traitors"!

(2)

The reason why the "Confucius" film can gain the support of a wide audience and arouse their emotional resonance, in addition to the film itself having various indelible advantages, is also related to the era in which Confucius lived.

Confucius's era was an era of hegemonic struggles among the feudal lords, ministers assassinating rulers, younger brothers assassinating older brothers, sons assassinating fathers, and rebellious ministers and traitors running rampant in the world, a time of extreme chaos throughout China. This era is of course not comparable to today's situation of national unity, unity, and rising up to resist foreign aggression; however, the retrograde behavior and the madness of rebellious ministers and traitors is a common sentiment in both ancient and modern times. Therefore, the portrayal of Confucius and his disciples' righteousness in the film, and their strict stance of being as distinct from rebellious ministers and traitors as the Jing River and the Wei River, is particularly vivid and intimate, and also provides a correct way of life for people in isolated islands today.

Confucius is a gatherer, an active, world-engaging salvationist. He is unwilling to be like the "secluded hermits who are good at cultivating themselves," placing the affairs of the world aside and ignoring them. He travels restlessly throughout his life, "looking like a homeless dog." Even so, he cannot cool his enthusiasm for saving the world by half. Starting from lecturing in the apricot altar, practicing martial arts in the countryside, and reserving talents for the country, and then entering the world to serve in the state of Lu; and attending the meeting in Jiagu; and starting the fourteen-year long march; and running out of food in Chen and Cai; and finally writing the Spring and Autumn Annals, the means he uses are different, the forms are different, the advances and retreats are turbulent, like the ups and downs of waves; however, he has never for a moment left the central concept of "saving the world and saving the world." The winding wave line always moves towards the bright shore.

In addition to "spreading the Tao, imparting knowledge, and resolving doubts," Confucius's teaching also instructs his disciples on how to grasp the times and how to correctly be a "person." ——

"The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual."

"Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace are the foundation for a great man to establish himself."

"A great man should sacrifice his life to achieve benevolence, and cannot seek to live by harming benevolence."

"I hope that my disciples will come out to be used by the country and purify the world."

"The responsibility of saving the world rests on everyone."

"……"

He uses every opportunity to teach tirelessly.

When he has leisure, he plays a song on the zither, allowing his disciples to listen attentively, integrating their bodies and minds. He kicks away the boundary stone between teacher and student, and merges with each other in the sound of the zither. ......

Once, Zilu was unaware that he was not wearing a hat, and still sighed loudly.

"A great man is born in a chaotic world, how can he..."

Confucius mocked him and said:

"How can a great man not wear a hat!"

After saying that, he laughed with his disciples, causing Zilu to slip away in embarrassment. This scene makes Confucius "humanized" from "deified," letting people see that he is a "person" with blood and emotions, not an illusory "god," and feels extra intimate. Confucius had already integrated life and education, making his disciples feel "like sitting in the spring breeze."

This is one aspect of his education method. In "practicing martial arts in the countryside," you can see another aspect of his education method. This other aspect is equivalent to today's "physical education" and "sports." However, creating a few reckless men with only physique and no soul is definitely not what Confucius wants; the magnificent call of "rebellious ministers and traitors are not allowed to enter the venue" contains the great function of stimulating the spirit and strictly distinguishing the Jing River and the Wei River. "Physical education class" is also a "self-cultivation class." Confucius's education really took great pains.

Later, he served as the Prime Minister of Lu, which best shows his eagerness and enthusiasm for saving the world. And at the "Meeting of Jiagu," Confucius did not succumb to coercion, but recovered the lost land of Lu, which makes people deeply feel that only justice is power in the world.

The long march began, and he tasted all kinds of hardships, during which he once ran out of food in Chen and Cai. This is a touchstone. Those who are not firm in their hearts will change their minds and betray their principles. But Confucius took it lightly. He plays the zither and sings loudly in the moonlight:

"Running around in all directions, sleeping in the cold wilderness, eliminating traitors and wolves!"

### Confucius and Modern China (First Place in the University Category)

— Wu Xiang, School of Engineering, Jiaotong University

Who does not admire Jesus's heart to save the world, who does not appreciate Sakyamuni's compassion, they are revered by people everywhere, the towering churches, the solemn temples, can symbolize their greatness. But I feel that——China's Confucius is much greater than them.

The civilized ancient countries in the world, such as Babylon, Egypt, and India, have either perished or weakened, but only China, with more than 4,000 years of history, still stands vigorously in the East. She owns one-twelfth of the world's land and one-quarter of the world's population. If she has not received the influence of special culture, how can she achieve this? And Confucius is the center of Taoist special culture, and also the great collector of the Cambodian culture. If we want to understand the true meaning of Confucius's doctrine, especially its relationship with modern China, then we need to have a further understanding of Confucius at least.

(1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People coincide with Confucius's thoughts: In the "Analects," Confucius said: "Guan Zhong assisted Duke Huan in dominating the feudal lords and rectifying the world, and the people have benefited from it to this day. Without Guan Zhong, we would have our hair disheveled and wear our robes buttoned on the left." Confucius said: "Guan Zhong's capacity is small!" From the meaning of the two sections, we can see that on the one hand, he praised him, and on the other hand, he sighed: The reason why Confucius praised Guan Zhong was because he could make Qi rich and powerful; the reason why Confucius sighed was because Guan Zhong failed to enable other nations to share the benefits and implement the world's great harmony, so he said that his capacity was small. Tao is precisely the two major steps of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nationalism——first seek the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation, and then seek the liberation of all small and weak nations in the world. As for democracy, although Confucius only talked about loving the people and did not directly advocate democracy, Mencius was a sage after Confucius, and he said: "The people are the most important, the state is second, and the ruler is the least important. From these simple words, we can know that the development of Chinese democratic thought was even earlier than the French Revolution. Analects: "Do not worry about poverty but worry about unevenness," this is the beginning of the Principle of People's Livelihood, so equalizing land ownership and restricting capital are all devoted to equality. From the above three points, we can say that the Three Principles of the People were born out of Confucius's thoughts, and it is not impossible.

(2) The old morality advocated by the New Life Movement is the same as Confucius's advocacy of life cultivation——the greatest of virtues is the word "benevolence," and loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace can all be included in it. Confucius rarely allowed people to use "benevolence," which is the reason. "The Tao of the Master is nothing but loyalty and forbearance." Loyalty is to blame oneself, and forbearance is to treat others. The loyalty to the monarch in the past is now loyalty to one's duty, loyalty to the country. We should understand the differences in the times and draw inferences from one example.

(3) Etiquette is the foundation of Confucianism in governing the world——some people think that etiquette is a tool to restrain people, but isn't law also? Law can only make up for the lack of etiquette, and it is absolutely impossible to abandon etiquette and follow the law. This is the quintessence of our country that we should preserve. "I am like others in hearing lawsuits, but I must make there be no lawsuits!" How loyal and honest this is.

Now is the year of our victory in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and everyone must make redoubled efforts. Confucius's spirit is even more worthy of our deep reflection and emulation. There are at least the following three points: (1) An indomitable spirit of struggle——Confucius traveled tirelessly around the states, hoping to practice his Tao and bring peace to the world. In the end, he could not be used, so he returned to teach his disciples, hoping that he would not have to see his actions in his lifetime, and that they could also be applied to future generations. "A gentleman is worried that his name will not be praised after his death," Confucius's active spirit of saving the world has fully expressed it. (2) The spirit of resisting aggression——Confucius said: "To lead the people to war without teaching them is called abandoning them," we must train us, and everyone will become a soldier. "Do not desire speed, do not see small profits, to desire speed is to fail, and to see small profits is to fail in big things." As long as we are determined to resist aggression for a long time, the final victory will belong to us. (3) The spirit of striving for one's position——"Someone asked Confucius and said: "Why does the Master not govern?" Confucius said: "The Book says, 'Filial piety! Only filial piety and brotherly love are applied to government,' this is also governing," so as long as we each perform our duties, we are loving wax, and we are defending the soldiers of the motherland.

Confucius is a sage of the times. We believe that Confucius is eternally great. Let us implement "Confucius's spirit" and complete the great cause of resisting aggression and national reconstruction, so that the culture of the frozen East will be brilliant and bright.

### Acknowledgement

— Fei Mu

After the release of the "Confucius" film, I am grateful for the kindness of all the wise people from all walks of life, who have given me advice and encouragement, which is very inspiring. It has been more than a month since "Confucius" was released, and there are still articles about the film in newspapers and magazines that can be read. In addition to heartfelt thanks, I simply cannot express my humble feelings in words. Of course, the reason why the "Confucius" film can receive such a warm response is because of the greatness of Confucius himself; however, as the producers of the film, we receive such "unexpected praise," which is really beyond the expectations of my colleagues. Of course, we are not only inspired, we know our weaknesses, and we know how we should live up to the expectations of all gentlemen in the future.

It is a pity that I have been too busy recently, and I can only take the time to read the great works of you gentlemen. This time, I have been waiting for the judges to complete the evaluation of the essays before I can read them one by one. While reading the great works of all parties, I originally wanted to write a short article to express my humble opinions, but now it can only become a wish.

We should have sent a special letter to the judges of the judging committee to thank them for taking the time to read our essays (Mr. Chen Dieye, in addition to grading each essay, also compared it with the film and gave detailed and accurate comments, which benefited me personally a lot.) Also, because I was busy, it was delayed. Now, I take the opportunity to thank you all here.

His disciples resonated with him generously, their emotions were passionate, and their righteousness was awe-inspiring. This moving scene is enough to touch the heavens and move the ghosts and gods; rebellious ministers and traitors will be sweating and have no place to hide after seeing it.

Confucius fought against the forces of darkness, rebellious ministers, and traitors throughout his life, and his spirit did not weaken even in his twilight years. This can be seen from his writing of the Spring and Autumn Annals.

"If the righteousness of the Spring and Autumn Annals is practiced, then rebellious ministers and traitors will be afraid." The Spring and Autumn Annals is a book full of righteousness, and this is his last effort. Although he was gray-haired at this time, hot blood was still running through his body, and he poured it all out under his wrist, prompting him to write straight, praising and criticizing heaven. ...

Speaking of Confucius's outlook on life, we can see a part of it in his conversation with Zigong. He said:

"After I die, there will be you, and after you die, there will be tens of millions of descendants. As long as righteousness exists, this world..."

Confucius was not a visionary, he was unwilling to place all his hopes on future generations; he had run around all his life and personally done a lot of work. But he was also unwilling to take himself too seriously, thinking that he could bear all the work alone, so he also looked forward to future generations at the same time.

Taking "saving the world" as his ambition, this is benevolence; having self-knowledge and knowing others, and having the clarity to trust others, this is wisdom; not avoiding hardships and doing practical work, this is manliness.

"Great is Confucius"!

I could have ended here, but what I cannot stop saying is Zilu's martial spirit.

From his calling out in the countryside as Sima, loudly shouting "Rebellious ministers and traitors are not allowed to enter the venue," to holding a staff to refuse to see Yang Huo; to clenching his fists and hitting him, shouting loudly "Great man..."; to breaking the staff and swearing: "Like this staff!"; to wielding his sword and beheading the dwarf at the "Meeting of Jiagu"; to dancing to the song when he ran out of food in Chen and Cai; and to being hired by the State of Wei and repaying with death, his heroic and high-spirited demeanor cannot be described in appropriate words.

But "courage" is not his only characteristic. His irrepressible anger when seeing Nanzi, closing his eyes tightly, can show that he has calm rationality; his waving his sleeves and shedding tears when saying goodbye to Confucius, in a few hot tears, you can see that he has a fiery emotion!…

This is the typical young person that China urgently needs today.

Thank you to Mr. Fei Mu and all the staff of this film for their extraordinary efforts, which have made Confucius's solemn and upright face revive vividly and intimately in front of us.

"Confucius"—not only awakens the righteousness of the world, but also shatters the courage of rebellious ministers and traitors.

Let us praise this soul-stirring bell.

### Li Amao's Hygiene Mailbox

(Asked by Mr. Yang Hanguang) Although I am old, I am born with a bald head. I don't know if there is any way to cure it?

(Answer) Barren fields can be cultivated, but baldness cannot grow hair. Basically, the skin has lost the texture to grow hair, and it will never grow. But baldness is not harmful. As the saying goes: the prime minister's head is bald, which shows a sign of wealth and honor, and it is very economical, saving the barber from asking you for money every month. It is also cooler in hot weather. In cold weather, if you are afraid of being stared at, you can wear a wig, which is very beautiful and warm, and you will never be spotted by people staring at your forehead. You don't have to worry about your pillow getting dirty easily at night. People without hair are really more cost-effective than us in every way. When you get older, your wife will never worry about your hair gradually growing, which is also a kind of happiness. I think you can make use of it and rent out the top of your head to the business community to advertise. Write advertising words and pictures on the top of your head, and go to the theater for two or three points of practice every day, which will definitely attract attention and greatly improve the effectiveness of the advertisement. You can get advertising fees and watch free plays, how cost-effective is that? But, don't do advertisements for hair growth oil, absolutely don't!
