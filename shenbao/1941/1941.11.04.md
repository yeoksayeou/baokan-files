### China Branch of the Anti-Aggression League Holds a General Assembly in Chongqing; Responding to and Celebrating the Victory of Democratic Nations; Chairman Chiang Delivers a Speech Urging Effort in Promotion

Chongqing The China branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement, in response to the joint call from the League's General Assembly and the Free World Association, held a general assembly to celebrate the victory of democratic nations, along with the third annual meeting of the association, at Fuzichi Square at 2:00 PM on the 2nd. The meeting was presided over by Wu Tiecheng, and was attended by Feng Yuxiang, Liu Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Ma Chaojun, Chen Fangxian, Bishop Yu Bin, and over 2,000 members of the association and people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign. Li Shizeng, chairman of the association's permanent representative delegation abroad, also rushed from Kunming. Chairman Chiang specially issued a speech. Wu Tiecheng first delivered the opening address, stating that the two fronts of aggression and anti-aggression are extremely clear in the current world. China stands on the front line of resistance to aggression and is the earliest country to oppose aggression, making great contributions to world peace. He then said that as the wars in the East and West are about to merge into one, he firmly believes that the Soviet Union in the West will be able to defeat Germany, and China in the East will also unite its 450 million people to defeat Japan. Finally, Wu earnestly hoped that the United States would use all effective means to effectively assist China and the Soviet Union to ensure the final victory. It was decided that Li Shizeng would report on the work of the International Anti-Aggression Movement General Assembly, the evolution of the outbreak of the European War, and the production process of the Free World Association. Afterwards, resolutions were passed to send greetings to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, and to express condolences to the soldiers at the front. The assembly also passed resolutions to (1) request the International Labor Conference to urge representatives from all countries to unanimously expand the anti-aggression movement and step up aid to China in order to eliminate the chief culprit of aggression in the Far East, (2) actively promote the ABCD democratic group and strengthen the international anti-aggression front, and (3) step up the movement for mutual assistance between China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States to destroy the axis of aggression and ensure world peace at an early date. Subsequently, the articles of association were amended, officers were re-elected, and a declaration was adopted. Speakers and reporters at the meeting included Liu Zhi, Bishop Yu Bin, and Qu Yingguang. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM. According to reports, the association currently has 18,252 individual members and 173 group members. The Free World Association was established in Washington on June 15th of this year, with the same aims as the International Anti-Aggression Movement General Assembly, and replaced the latter in activities in the United States to avoid the doubts of American isolationists about the association's name. Chairman Chiang's letter to the association stated: "To the China branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement General Assembly: Your branch is holding its third annual meeting in the capital of our country, which was the first to resist aggression, and at a time when the situation of resistance and reconstruction is becoming increasingly tense. This is enough to establish a reputation and boost the morale of the soldiers resisting the war. However, at present, the aggressive countries are colluding and seeking each other, trying to overthrow the order of world peace and enslave the peace-loving nations of the world. Their conspiracy has become more and more obvious and active. Our country took the lead in resisting the war and has established a strong fortress against aggression, and is the only stabilizing force for establishing permanent peace in East Asia. It shares the fate of the world's democratic countries. It is hoped that your association will deeply understand this purpose and step up promotion, so that the unity of the democratic countries and their actions will be more agile and adapt to the times, in order to strike at the aggressor in the Far East, so that it will restrain its ambitions. Then your contribution to the international anti-aggression effort will be particularly great. Chiang Zhongzheng, in Chongqing." (Dated the 2nd)

### Chairman Chiang Recently in Mount Heng; Convening Military Command Meeting; Japan Plans to Adopt New Offensive to End War Against China; Chinese Military High Command Closely Watching Japanese Movements

Chongqing Reuters has learned from responsible sources that although there is no definite news about the Japanese army's plan to launch a new offensive against Chongqing, the Chinese military high command is currently busy dealing with this move. The plenary session of the Central Kuomintang Executive Committee, originally scheduled for Wednesday, has been postponed again. There is much speculation in all circles about possible Japanese actions, but it is generally believed that this decision by the Japanese seems to be a final effort to destroy Chinese military resistance and end the China Incident as soon as possible. As for whether the Japanese army will attack the Yunnan-Burma Road, or advance north across the Yellow River in the northern part of China, or advance west to directly spy on Chongqing, it is impossible to predict. Two weeks ago, Chinese military experts expressed the opinion that the Japanese army may attack in several routes at the Hetao area at the junction of Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces. The Japanese army in southern Shanxi may attempt to cross the Yellow River near Tongguan and Luoyang, while the Japanese army in western Shanxi may attempt to cross the river to spy on Xi'an. The Japanese army on the Pinghan Railway may attempt to attack Luoyang and Nanyang west from Zhengzhou and Xinyang. However, the Japanese army's withdrawal from Zhengzhou has changed the external appearance of the military situation in northern China and led people to speculate that the Japanese army will abandon the attempt to cross the river for the time being. Although there are rumors that the Japanese army is busy moving on the Thai border and that the Japanese army is gathering in southern Vietnam, the informed opinion is that the Japanese army's strength and current actions in Vietnam are not enough to launch a large-scale offensive to cut off the Yunnan-Burma Road or threaten Kunming. Moreover, the water level of the Yangtze River is currently very low, which is also unfavorable for the Japanese army to launch a major offensive in the Yangtze River basin. However, the Chinese army recently convened a military command meeting in Mount Heng in southern Hunan to study the Changsha battle situation. It is reported that Chairman Chiang greatly praised General Yang Sen, a famous general from Sichuan Province, for his efforts in leading his troops to fight hard behind Japanese lines. The recapture of Changsha was largely due to the strength of this army. (Reuters dispatch, dated the 3rd) For praising and congratulating, the recapture of Changsha was largely due to the strength of this army. (Reuters dispatch, dated the 3rd) Zheng Gang, Vice Minister Yu Hongjun, Vice Minister Hong Lanyou, Vice Minister Huang Bodu, Minister Lin Yizhong, Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi, Mayor Wu Guozhen, Director Shuai Jie, and Second Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, directors of various departments, etc. During the meeting, Foreign Minister Guo stood up and made a speech, stating that he represented the government and expressed his welcome to Sir Eggleston, the first Australian Minister to China. Australia is the self-governing dominion in the British Empire that is closest to China. It is only natural that China and Australia should exchange envoys first. The arrival of the Australian envoy in China will not only strengthen the cooperation between China and Australia, but also symbolize the promotion of friendly cooperation between China and Britain. Sir Eggleston is a first-class politician in Australia and has served as an important cabinet member of the Australian cabinet. He is experienced and knowledgeable. We are very happy that Sir will be stationed in our country. China and Australia are both anti-aggression countries. At this time when the Pacific is facing dangerous times, we should strengthen cooperation to stop the common enemy that is disturbing the peace of the Pacific. The Japanese once said that the ABCD line is an encirclement line against Japan. In fact, from the Philippines, Australia, the Dutch East Indies, Thailand, and the Yunnan-Vietnam border to Siberia, it is the common defense line of anti-aggressive countries. Any foreign aggression against the above-mentioned areas should be regarded as an infringement on all anti-aggressive countries. I deeply hope that the Sir will cooperate to complete our common mission of anti-aggression. After the speech, Foreign Minister Guo raised his glass to wish the King of England and the Australian envoy good health. The Australian envoy immediately stood up to express his gratitude, stating that he was very honored to be ordered to be the envoy to your country. The psychology of the Australian people is definitely not like this. The Australian people are aware of their position and mission in the current world situation. The people of China and Australia share the nature of loving peace. I hope that we can strengthen cooperation between the two countries to promote the arrival of world peace. The Australian envoy said at the end that he had presided over transportation and water and electricity administration. He very much hoped that in the future, in addition to his original mission to promote friendly relations between China and Australia, he could study and learn in this regard to increase his knowledge. After the speech, he raised his glass to wish China longevity and Foreign Minister Guo good health. The guests and hosts enjoyed the banquet and the meeting ended around 3:00 PM. (Dated the 3rd)

### Minister Wang Shijie Receives Reporters; Delivers Important Remarks; Japan Increases Troops in Northeast and Vietnam; Government Promoting Grain Policy Extremely Smoothly

Chongqing Minister Wang Shijie received Chinese and foreign reporters at the International Propaganda Department on the afternoon of the third, and delivered a speech. The main points of the speech are as follows:

(1) The movements of the Japanese army and what the Tojo cabinet will do in the future are still subject to much speculation. However, according to information from many sources, one fact is beyond doubt, that is, the Japanese government is increasing troops in the northeastern provinces of China and in Vietnam. The Japanese government's increase of troops in the Northeast may be aimed at the Soviet Union, carrying out a kind of nerve war, hoping to achieve some kind of purpose by relying on this kind of threat. However, judging from the border conflict between the Japanese and Soviet troops published by TASS last week, the Soviet Union's invulnerability to threats and determination to resist any aggression are very obvious. The Japanese army's increasing troops to Vietnam may be aimed at advancing south or attacking the Yunnan-Vietnam border of our country. In any case, the Japanese army's adventure in Vietnam can only be limited to one side at a time, and it cannot launch offensives on both sides at the same time. However, Japan's possible enemies, no matter how Japan launches an offensive, have regarded Japan as a common enemy. This situation is also very obvious, and there is no need to discuss it in depth.

(2) Arita Hachiro goes to Vietnam

In addition to increasing troops, the Japanese government has also sent Arita Hachiro to Vietnam. Although Japan and the Vichy government have established several agreements, the Vietnamese authorities are initially unwilling to be Japan's tools. If Japan wants to use Vietnam as a base for large-scale military operations, it must naturally attach considerable importance to the attitude of the Vietnamese authorities. The dispatch of Arita Hachiro may be for this purpose. As for whether Arita Hachiro can succeed, it depends on how the French government views the new situation created by the anti-aggression countries in the South Pacific. Thailand's attitude has obviously changed due to the formation of this new situation. Recently, the government's promotion of the grain policy has been very smooth. The collection and purchase of grain in various provinces has reached an average of one-third of the total purchase amount this year. Some counties have completed all purchases by the end of last month. The problem with the grain policy is the transportation and storage of grain after the purchase. Taking Sichuan as an example, the total amount of grain purchased this year is 12 million *shi*. There are more than 1,500 collection sites. Except for a part that is allocated locally as military rations or public grain, the rest is waiting to be transferred and allocated. Currently, grain storage and transportation agencies have been established in various places, and manpower is being used as much as possible. After this effort, transportation and other matters should be able to cooperate with the purchase and proceed smoothly. Moreover, there is sufficient rainfall in the southwestern provinces, and the winter water is also very abundant. There is still hope for a bumper harvest next year. This is also expected.

### Yunnan Province Military and Civilians Prepare for War to Defend Their Territory; Lattimore Speaks

Chongqing Owen Lattimore, an American political advisor to Chairman Chiang, told the United Press that Long Yun, Chairman of Yunnan Province, and the people of Yunnan Province are prepared to cooperate with the Central Army to defend Yunnan Province if the Japanese army attacks from the south. Lattimore has just returned from a preliminary inspection of the interior, especially Yunnan Province. He revealed that he will serve as an advisor to Chairman Chiang in January, and will return to Washington after a six-month term. He said that the political ideas and education of the people of Yunnan Province are very simple, and it is difficult for Japanese personnel to make progress in Yunnan Province. He also said that he could not comment on the rumored relationship between the Japanese and Yunnan, but the government has paid attention to it. The issue of the Japanese simply attacking Yunnan Province has become a common topic of discussion among people in the area. Lattimore also pointed out that the tribal issue is one of the most complex issues in Yunnan Province. According to what he knows, there are at least 60 tribes in Yunnan Province, most of which have their own unique languages, and a few have writing. He also said that what he paid most attention to was the people and farmers in the rural special areas of Yunnan, whose conditions are far superior to those of other provinces in China. (Associated Press dispatch, dated the 3rd)

### Telecommunications Conference Sends Telegram to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to Pay Respects

### Various Diplomatic Organizations Schedule Regular Receptions for Diplomatic Personnel; Minister Wang Plans Large-Scale Reception for Foreign Guests

Chongqing The various people's diplomatic organizations previously planned to hold a grand tea party for Belgian Ambassador Guillaume. Later, the scope was expanded to include all diplomatic personnel from British, American, and Soviet embassies, the Australian envoy, and the Magruder and Nimeia delegations. This matter is being prepared by the National Diplomacy Association and has now been scheduled for the 12th of this month to celebrate Sun Yat-sen's birthday. The so-called people's diplomatic organizations, in addition to the National Diplomacy Association, include the Anti-Aggression League, the League of Nations Association, and the China-America, China-England, China-Soviet Union, China-France, Belgium-Switzerland, and Oriental Nationalities cultural associations. Minister of Propaganda Wang Shijie has scheduled a reception for foreign guests and Chinese and foreign journalists the day after tomorrow. 400 people have been invited and will be served wonton noodles, dumplings, yellow wine, white wine, dried tofu, and peanuts. This is a new trend in large-scale tea parties, which is to use local materials and not spend foreign exchange. (Havas dispatch, dated the 3rd)

### America Closely Watches Japanese Warship Activity, Australia Prepares to Accept War, Burmese Prime Minister U Saw Will Visit Australia from England, British Generals in India and the Far East to Confer

United Press, Washington, 3rd - The U.S. Navy Department yesterday declined to comment on reports of continuous Japanese naval activities in Hawaii and the Central Pacific, but reliable sources said that even if the information is accurate, it would not cause unease in the United States. It is claimed that the U.S. fleet and air force are closely monitoring the area. Furthermore, it is stated that the Pacific defense line extends from Oahu in a 1,000-mile radius and from Midway, Wake, Guam, and Luzon in a 750-mile radius. In short, these islands form what is called the "Pacific Bridge."

Reuters, London, 3rd - Australian High Commissioner to the UK, Sir Earle Page, responded today to German ridicule of Australia's war efforts, saying that Australia's war preparations far exceed German understanding. Australia has never been militarily as strong as it is today. Currently, over 250,000 Australians are serving in the armed forces. Munitions production has increased twentyfold since the start of the war and will soon increase sixtyfold. The Australian Air Force currently has over 40,000 personnel and is increasing weekly. He concluded by saying that Australia wishes to maintain peace in the Pacific but will accept and prepare for any spread of war.

Reuters, Sydney, 3rd - It is reported that Burmese Prime Minister U Saw will visit Australia briefly on his way back from England.

Reuters, Canberra, 3rd - Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced today that British Deputy Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East and Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Imperial Force, General Blamey, has departed for Australia for consultations and is expected to arrive soon.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd - Strengthening the defense and improving the Burma Road for the transport of goods to Chongqing is the most important task in the Southeast Asian problems of current British and American policy. According to a special correspondent for the Asahi Shimbun, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, General Wavell, has arrived in Rangoon to discuss plans for the defense of Burma with the Burmese authorities. On the other hand, Lauchlin Currie, Roosevelt's special envoy to Chongqing, declared in Chongqing that the Burma Road has been greatly improved and a large quantity of weapons and ammunition is now being transported to Chongqing via this route.

Reuters, Singapore, 3rd - General Wavell arrived here yesterday and conferred with Lieutenant-Governor-General van Mook before departing for Australia. General Wavell was accompanied by his staff. Before leaving, he will confer on defense matters with Air Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Command, and Vice Admiral Layton, Commander-in-Chief of the British Navy in China.

United Press, Singapore, 3rd - General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, arrived here yesterday morning by special plane to confer with the British Far East Command generals stationed here, including Air Chief Marshal Sir Brooke-Popham.

Reuters, Batavia, 3rd - The van Mook's departed for Australia yesterday. It is said that their decision to go to Australia is to continue discussions on the adjustment of British efforts in the Far East. After this, they will go to New Zealand. It is expected to take a month to return to Singapore. He declined to comment on the general situation in the Far East, saying only that it was "very uncertain." He also said that he would soon submit a comprehensive report to the British government on its achievements to date and make a presentation. Regarding General Wavell's recent visit to Singapore, it is said that he wanted to personally inspect the progress of the defenses and confer with Air Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Command.

Reuters, Batavia, 3rd - The Netherlands East Indies Air Force will soon receive several North American NA-40 bombers. This aircraft can fly 4,300 kilometers, or from Batavia to Taiwan, without refueling.

Japan-U.S. Negotiations to Be Submitted to the Diet for Discussion

Haitong News Agency, 2nd - Well-informed sources say that the Japan-U.S. negotiations in Washington will be submitted for discussion at the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet on November 15. It is expected that Prime Minister Tojo will reject the U.S.'s delaying tactics and warn Washington that negotiations cannot continue indefinitely. It is expected here that the U.S. will continue to insist on maintaining the status quo in the Far East and will not recognize Japan's special position in the Far East and as the leader of the Far East. It is widely believed that Prime Minister Tojo will solemnly declare that the Japanese government is determined to continue its policy of building a new world order and will appeal to the nation to redouble its efforts to enable Japan to cope with any crisis.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd - According to a Washington correspondent for the Asahi Shimbun, well-informed sources in Washington believe that the United States cannot reach an agreement with Japan before the extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet on November 15. Although some are optimistic about future developments, most believe that war with Japan is inevitable. Even those in the government who advocate avoiding conflict with Japan oppose making concessions to Japan. They expect Japan to propose measures to ease tensions. Washington generally believes that the United States will not abandon its policy of economic pressure on Japan.

London, 1st - Well-informed observers believe that the current situation in the Pacific is the calm before the storm. The tense situation when Tojo first took office as Prime Minister has been greatly eased. Apart from a blustering reaction from Tokyo when news spread that German troops were approaching Moscow, there have been no other serious developments. The Pacific crisis is expected to resume around the 15th of this month, when the Japanese Diet will convene an extraordinary session. If the U.S. and Japan have not reached an agreement by then, Tojo is expected to reaffirm his formal commitment to the Tripartite Pact, and the evolution of the Soviet war situation may also determine Japan's decisive action, when and where. The Japanese side angrily pointed out that U.S.-Japan relations have virtually been severed due to the U.S. economic blockade. The British believe that the Chinese side's statement on the outcome of the talks with Washington is sufficient to show China's loyalty to its path and also shows that it believes that Japan's aggression plans are extremely incompatible with the common interests and security of the ABCD line. Tokyo is moving towards a path of rupture: Japan will not concede to the ABCD powers, and the ABCD powers must concede to Japan. If the ABCD powers can concede without destroying the entire foundation of their claims, it is inconceivable. If Tokyo insists on conflict, Japan will commit national suicide. Qualified observers predict that if Tojo cannot eliminate this kind of distress and constraint, the life of his cabinet will be limited, and whoever succeeds him will not be able to survive if he adopts the same policy.

Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd - The anti-American movement in Japanese newspapers has been emphasized again today. All major newspapers attribute the current tense situation in the Pacific to the United States and accuse the United States of deliberately delaying the talks in Washington in order to gain time to complete its preparations and to intensify the so-called ABCD encirclement of Japan and insist on assisting Chongqing. The Hochi Shimbun stated that the Japanese government would deal with the malicious actions of the United States by force. The Army's Kokumin Shimbun stated that Japan does not want to sacrifice its own right to exist in order to maintain peace in the Pacific. The Asahi Shimbun stated that the United States has never understood Japan's desire for world peace and has not corrected its false attitude. The Chugai Shogyo Shimbun warned the United States to make an accurate assessment of Japan's strength. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that current U.S. policy is based on the misconception that Japan's economic strength for national defense has gradually weakened due to the four-year war with China.

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd - In accordance with national tradition, Japanese Foreign Minister Togo left here last night for the Ise Shrine to report on his appointment as Foreign Minister. It is understood that Togo will return to Tokyo today.

### Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Comments on Border Conflict Incident: Says It Doesn't Care About Treaty Constraints, Judgement Should Be Based on Japanese Actions

United Press, Kuibyshev, 3rd - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Lozovsky criticized yesterday the recent border conflict between Japanese troops and Soviet troops in the Far East, saying that the new Japanese government under Prime Minister Tojo should be judged not by its treaty constraints, but by its actions. He stated that the Soviet Union sincerely hopes that this border conflict was caused by untrained Japanese troops. We hope that the Japanese government will punish these Japanese troops who attacked the Soviet Union (the Japanese War Department is aware of this matter). He also stated that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan is tied to the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact signed on April 13. In summary, the meaning of policy lies in facts, not empty words. Therefore, judging the new Japanese government should be based on its actions, and Japan should not be judged hastily based on its treaty constraints.

### American Goods Are Continuously Transported to China

United Press, Manila, 3rd - American businessmen arriving here today by clipper plane from Singapore and Rangoon said that Burmese authorities are closely watching for a Japanese attack on Yunnan Province from Vietnam, trying to cut off the Burma Road to halt China's important supply route. Although these travelers say the Japanese forces in Vietnam continue to increase, they express doubt that Japan currently has sufficient troops and supplies to attack Thailand or Burma, as this attack would obviously risk a direct conflict with Britain and the United States. The travelers say that the volume of Lend-Lease goods arriving from Singapore and Rangoon is gradually increasing. The docks are piled high with these goods, and shipments are also increasing via the Burma Road. American army transport vehicles, rushed from Rangoon to China via the Burma Road, still have American army numbers and paint visible. Uninformed natives see the rapid delivery of aid and think that the American army has come to China. A large number of American aircraft have arrived in Rangoon, where they are assembled and tested by American pilots before flying north. One American aircraft expert, who did not want to be identified, said, "Based on the speed at which American aircraft and other equipment are being transported to Singapore and Burma, and the large number of British troops that have now gathered there, if Japan attacks Thailand to establish a base, it will be like poking a hornet's nest. I don't believe that Britain will allow Japan to militarily occupy Thailand."

### American Newspapers Attach Importance to Philippine Elections

United Press, Washington, 3rd - American newspapers yesterday prominently featured news of the upcoming Philippine elections, including the news that President Quezon and his running mate Osmeña will be re-elected. Although some officials here related to the Philippines are slightly dissatisfied with the tendency of the Philippines to support one-party rule, the majority of neutral parties believe that the Philippine elections, in the unstable situation in the Far East, are a good symbol of the democratic system standing firm in the Far East under the covetous eyes of the Axis powers. Officials and non-officials alike believe that the continuation of American Far Eastern policy and the re-election of President Quezon are necessary, just as President Roosevelt's re-election in November 1940 was necessary. All parties say that any changes in the Philippine government would be extremely unwise, as efforts should now be focused on national defense. They also say that President Quezon is not only extremely familiar with administrative issues, but also that his correct international views have long been recognized by the world, making him the most ideal Philippine spokesman during the world war.

United Press, Hyde Park, 3rd - President Roosevelt yesterday ordered that the entire Coast Guard be placed under naval jurisdiction. The purpose of this move is clearly to strengthen the strength of the Atlantic Fleet.

### U.S. Coast Guard Transferred to Naval Department, Two-Ocean Fleet Rapidly Developing, Two New Battleships to Be Launched Soon

United Press, Washington, 3rd - Well-informed sources here today believe that President Roosevelt's approval of transferring the Coast Guard to naval jurisdiction is mainly intended to unify command of the forces defending the coast. President Wilson took the same measures during the First World War, and the Coast Guard was returned to the Treasury Department after the end of the war. Well-informed sources say that the Coast Guard has 20,000 enlisted personnel and 1,700 officers, and the Coast Guard fleet has 290 ships, not including many smaller vessels. House Naval Committee Minority Leader Maecius stated, "This transfer will integrate the patrol equipment of the inner coast and seaports into the Navy's anti-submarine program, effectively preventing submarines from sneaking into seaports or approaching the coast."

United Press, Washington, 3rd - It was announced today that the rapidly developing U.S. two-ocean fleet will be greatly strengthened within four months by two new 35,000-ton battleships joining their sister ships. The fifth 35,000-ton U.S. battleship to join the two-ocean fleet is the USS Indiana, which will enter service on November 21. The sixth is the USS Alabama, which will be launched at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on February 16, 1942. The USS Alabama will be equipped with particularly powerful anti-aircraft weapons, with three turrets, nine 16-inch guns, and twenty 5-inch guns for combat. According to well-informed sources, the hull is 16-inch armor and the deck is 10-inch steel armor, but the exact details of the armor are being kept secret.

Havas Agency, Washington, 2nd - The new American first-class cruiser USS Cleveland (displacement 10,000 tons) was launched today at the New Garden Shipyard. The ship is very fast and was built by the Newport News Shipbuilding Company, completing construction seven months ahead of schedule. According to the American "Two-Ocean Navy Plan," a total of 52 such warships are planned to be built. Responsible parties also announced that 22 new ships, including one cruiser, one destroyer, and three submarines, were launched in American shipyards in October, an average of one new ship being launched every three days. In the same month, 22 new ships had their keels laid and construction started in various shipyards, averaging one new ship being built every day. In addition, 17 new ships, including one aircraft carrier and one destroyer, joined the fleet in October.

### Japanese Ship Tatsuta Maru Leaves U.S. with Evacuees

Reuters, San Francisco, 3rd - The Japanese ship Tatsuta Maru was delayed by two hours from its scheduled departure time due to the need to remove and inspect 60 tons of mail. The ship carries over 1,000 passengers and is piled high with luggage, equipment, and food. This ship is likely to be one of the last ships traveling between the U.S. and Japan. A Japanese member of parliament was also on board. Before departing, he told reporters that he believed the dispute between the U.S. and Japan could be resolved, but others on board did not hold this view. The atmosphere was tense both on the ship and on the dock.

### Large Amounts of Chinese Currency Float Ashore on Norfolk Coast, Suspected to Be from Sunken Ships, Chinese Financial Officials Are Investigating

United Press, Norfolk, 3rd - Hundreds and thousands of banknotes continue to float ashore on the coasts of this area and the Outer Banks, but the finders must go to China to use them. The banknotes are believed to be from sunken ships. A schoolboy yesterday recovered an egg crate from the beach containing 50,000 two-yuan banknotes. Subsequently, another fisherman in Norfolk also said that he had picked up countless banknotes on the beach. Chinese Ministry of Finance officials, who contracted here in 1939 to print 100 million yuan in banknotes, are currently investigating the matter.

Editorial

### The Future of Chinese Legal Tender

Recently, prices in this city have soared, presenting an unprecedented state of panic, affecting the livelihood of citizens, no different from being devoured alive, and gradually destroying the foundation of the national economy, the harm of which is severe. Examining the beginning of this panic, it is nothing more than rumors such as Japan's impending attack on the Burma Road and the imminent conflict between Japan and the United States, and the performance of this panic ultimately remains concentrated in the seizing and hoarding of financial goods in the market, abandoning legal tender in exchange for gold and foreign exchange.

Regarding the speculative transactions and soaring prices in the Shanghai market, this newspaper's editorials have repeatedly explained the improperness and corrective countermeasures. The foolishness of a single opinion aims to encourage our compatriots to wake up suddenly, reverse this chaotic situation, and wait for the arrival of a bright and splendid victory. However, loyal words must be unpleasant to the ear, and good medicine is inevitably bitter to the taste. Not only has the wind of speculation not subsided slightly, but it has intensified, as if legal tender is about to become like the ruble and mark of the First World War. The general people who see profit and forget righteousness are all competing to be the first, pouring out their baskets and boxes, selling legal tender and taking over goods and foreign exchange. There is no way to name this special psychological life of the international market, naming it: a blind man riding a blind horse, it does not seem excessive.

Today, the speculative behavior in the Shanghai market is becoming increasingly rampant, which is enough to reflect the participants' loss of reason and civic responsibility; and those very few who destroy legal tender for the sake of the hundreds of millions of people in the Great Rear Area who spare no sacrifice to support legal tender are also compatriots. If they ask themselves, if they have a conscience, can they not feel ashamed? The writer firmly believes that our country's legal tender will never be destroyed, nor will it ever follow in the footsteps of the ruble and mark. Why do I say this? I would like to explain its meaning.

Legal tender is the symbol of the national economy, and it was created in this difficult environment. Because the burden and credit of legal tender are the burden and credit of the entire nation, the greatest significance of the permanent non-destruction of legal tender is based on this. Although the purchasing power of legal tender in the Shanghai market today is extremely unstable, considering the prices of goods in various regions of the Great Rear Area (excluding cities), the exchange value of legal tender is largely the same as before the war, which is enough to slightly fix the value of the currency and the people's beliefs. In other words, most people are happy to accept and use legal tender and contribute their necessities of life, agricultural products. Therefore, those who support legal tender today are farmers and agricultural products, and those who will permanently support it in the future are also farmers and agricultural products. As for the assistance of friendly nations, it is only temporary and partial support. Fortunately, our country is an agricultural country, and farmland can never be completely destroyed and can be cultivated and produced at any time. If our country has become an industrialized country? Then, once destroyed, the production mechanism will be stranded, and legal tender will lose its support—this is the most important basic understanding of the difference between legal tender and the ruble and mark. The non-destruction of legal tender can be seen at a glance.

Or again, it is said that legal tender has entered the stage of inflation. This is also a one-sided judgment. In the past, in the gold standard or silver standard era, so-called inflation referred to the excessive issuance of representative currency, or being stranded and unable to circulate, so that it could not be exchanged for gold coins or silver coins, and it was not known that the reason why it could not be exchanged for gold coins or silver coins was still because it failed to produce in time to support the expansion of this currency. Today, our country's legal tender, whether it has only increased five and a half times as announced by the Ministry of Finance, or about nine times as estimated by Western economists, in terms of population and productivity, the support obtained by legal tender is more than enough, and its turnover and use can be handled with ease.

In summary, the depreciation of legal tender in the Shanghai market today is by no means to reveal the decline in its own currency value, but entirely due to the buying and selling of speculators, without a doubt. Mr. McGovern, chairman of the Expenditure Committee of the British House of Commons, said with emotion that gold has exhausted its monetary function, and in the future, gold is about to be retired and will have no use. Therefore, we should urgently stimulate our conscience and change our beliefs. We sincerely hope that speculators will immediately abandon their immediate interests and seek long-term careers, so that they can reap both fame and fortune and leave a good name for future generations.

### Moscow War Enters Most Critical Phase; German Forces Launch Pincer Attacks from the South; German Forces at Leningrad Adopt Defensive Posture; German Forces in Crimea Advance Fiercely Towards Mount Chatyr-Dag

United Press, Kubyshev, 3rd – Yesterday's war news reported that two major German forces launched pincer attacks from the south of Moscow, attempting a third or final assault on the Soviet capital before winter. Fierce battles are raging throughout the Crimean Peninsula in the south. It is reported that the German forces have abandoned their usual narrow, knife-shaped armored unit attack strategy and are launching a massive offensive eastward towards Tula, 110 miles south of Moscow, and Serpukhov, 60 miles south of Moscow. The purpose of this military action is to defeat all defenses south of the capital, forcing a swift resolution. It is reported that the Red Army has launched counterattacks at several points near Moscow, claiming that German attempts to cross the Oka River near Serpukhov have been repelled. Moscow Radio reported that bloody battles are taking place in various regions of Crimea. Foreign Commissar Lozovsky stated that the battles between the two sides in the area between Taganrog and Rostov have resulted in enormous losses for both sides. Lozovsky denied rumors that German forces had gained the outskirts of Rostov but admitted that the situation for Soviet forces there is quite serious. After a day of continuous fierce fighting, the German advance has been halted, and it is said that the war in Moscow has now entered its most critical phase. The German side wants to capture Moscow before the onset of winter, so it is now transferring reserve tank units, artillery, and fresh troops to assist in the battle. The German forces advancing on Moscow from the south are currently being blocked at Tula, where Soviet forces are launching repeated counterattacks, with the Germans attacking two or three times every night, as if it were daytime. Soviet forces in Kalinin have surrounded German forces entrenched in the northeast of Kalinin, and street fighting is reportedly underway.

Reuters, London, 3rd – Moscow Radio, broadcasting to the front lines last night, stated that Stalin has ordered the Red Army fighting in the areas of Mozhaisk, Maloyaroslavets, and Tula not to retreat a single step. The radio station also warned against assuming that the threat to the Soviet capital has weakened simply because the intensity of the German attacks has recently decreased. It is reported that German reserve forces are being rushed to the Moscow front, clearly indicating that they are preparing to launch a new offensive against Moscow. Since the start of the German war against the Soviet Union, the German side has lost four million officers and soldiers, including some of its best staff officers. The quality of the reserve troops now being deployed is far inferior to that of the German army at the start of the war, it is said. The official German news agency reported a military review from Berlin, mentioning Soviet tank counterattacks in the front, northern, and southern sectors. It claimed that Soviet forces in the northern sector attempted to recapture territory occupied by German forces, with ten Soviet tanks destroyed. In the central sector, a German infantry division broke through Soviet lines, resulting in hand-to-hand combat. As a result, the German forces advanced and seized several locations. In the southern sector, German forces repelled a Soviet counterattack led by heavy tanks, destroying three Soviet tanks. The most important item in Sunday's war report was the special official German announcement that German forces have occupied Simferopol in Crimea. Berlin also claimed that German forces on this front are continuing to advance and have reached the northern outskirts of Mount Chatyr-Dag. The Soviet side has not yet issued any formal confirmation of this. Soviet sources only acknowledge that German forces on the Crimean front are still exerting intense pressure but claim that German forces have suffered heavy losses. The intensity of the fighting and the seriousness of the situation in that area are evident. A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from Kubyshev that while Soviet defenses in Crimea are easy to defend, they are not impregnable. The official Soviet news agency claimed that on Saturday and Sunday, there were no special operations by German forces. German forces attacked several times in various sectors but were repelled. German forces attempting to attack the Soviet front lines on the Nara River near Moscow were also repelled, suffering heavy losses. German artillery and mortar activity continued across the entire front. Soviet forces launched several counterattacks. Soviet defenders at Leningrad crossed a certain river to drive out German forces entrenched for combat. German forces in this sector are now adopting a defensive posture. In the Moscow theater of war, German forces were repelled from a broad offensive front in the Volokolamsk area.

Rumors of German-Romanian Forces Advancing Towards Sevastopol

International News Service, Berlin, 3rd – A special communiqué from the Führer's headquarters stated that after German-Romanian forces occupied Simferopol, they are rapidly advancing towards Sevastopol, the Black Sea port and Soviet naval base, now only 25 miles away. Three-quarters of the Crimean Peninsula is now in the hands of the German-Romanian forces. The German Air Force is currently conducting continuous bombing raids on land fortifications, port facilities, and ships in the port area of Sevastopol. Several Soviet ships have been damaged. The vanguard of the German-Romanian forces is advancing south of Mount Chatyr-Dag, indicating that they have penetrated deep into the Crimean Peninsula. Mount Chatyr-Dag is located almost at the southern tip of Crimea and is one of the world's famous seaside resorts. Before the Soviet revolution, it was a popular retreat for the royal family and nobility. After 1917, the Soviet government confiscated the summer palaces in the area and converted them into worker's rest areas.

Havas, Berlin, 3rd – It has just been learned that German aircraft again bombed the important Soviet naval port of Sevastopol in Crimea yesterday, sinking a large merchant ship and a warship. Local anti-aircraft batteries and military targets were also hit.

United Press, Berlin, 3rd – Nazi military dispatches recently stated that Hitler's powerful forces have indeed stormed into Simferopol, the capital of Crimea (only 35 miles from the major naval base of Sevastopol), threatening to drive Soviet defenders into the Sea of Azov. (According to French dispatches, Marshal Timoshenko, commander of the Southern Soviet Front, has ordered Soviet ships to abandon Sevastopol and has concentrated large forces at Kerch, at the eastern end of the Crimean Peninsula, hoping to prevent German forces from invading the Caucasus from Crimea.) In a special communiqué, the German High Command also announced the occupation of Simferopol, stating that German and Romanian troops have crossed this Black Sea peninsula and reached the Chatyr-Dag Mountains on the southeastern coast. Other Nazi sources stated that the Soviet command retreated from Simferopol at the time, offering no resistance, leaving only strong rear guard forces to defend their positions. The German forces then broke through their positions in an orderly fashion and defeated them. News from the central front indicated that a German infantry division, after fierce fighting, broke through a strongly defended Soviet position on the approaches to Moscow. It was also stated that after breaking through this position, large numbers of German troops advanced again and captured seven villages in heroic combat. "Even though the fighting was extremely difficult, our losses remained light."

TASS, Moscow, 3rd – The enemy has reinforced its attacks in Crimea, and despite our army's valiant resistance, we have been forced to retreat to new lines. Fighting is fierce in the areas of Gorlovka and Kisetyakov. In one decisive battle, 3,000 enemy officers and soldiers were killed or wounded. The Red Army, led by Vanin, also destroyed 16 enemy tanks, 100 trucks, 9 anti-tank guns, and 700 enemy soldiers at a certain point.

Shaposhnikov Appointed Chief of the Soviet General Staff

International News Service, Kubyshev, 3rd – Marshal Shaposhnikov has been appointed Chief of the Red Army General Staff, succeeding General Zhukov, who is now commanding Soviet forces on the Moscow front. Shaposhnikov is Deputy Commissar of Defense, a close friend of Stalin, and considered a "brain trust" of the Red Army. During World War I, Shaposhnikov served as a colonel in the Tsarist army but later turned to supporting Soviet ideals. Shaposhnikov's appointment coincides with renewed German advances on both the southern and central fronts.

British Transport of Military Supplies Arrives at Arkhangelsk Port

Reuters, Stockholm, 3rd – Correspondents from various newspapers stationed in Helsinki report that, according to Soviet soldiers captured by Finnish forces, several large British transport ships have arrived at Arkhangelsk Port. It is reported that the military supplies on board have been quickly transported south. It is also rumored that some British personnel, mostly drivers and mechanics, have also arrived in the area.

Reuters, Stockholm, 3rd – According to the *Tidningen* correspondent stationed in Helsinki, German and Finnish troops are advancing north at full speed and are now only 14 miles from Murmansk. Finnish aircraft are continuously attacking the railway line in that area.

### The Beginning and End of the Roosevelt-Churchill Atlantic Meeting (Part 2)

All officials were dismissed, and they spoke alone for more than an hour. The planks of the abandoned deck vibrated rhythmically in the Atlantic waves. Churchill's face was childlike. His entourage had brought a large batch of documents and several maps.

Churchill was wearing thick clothes, although the weather was not too cold. The President was wearing light-striped summer clothes. For most of the time during the meeting, the President wore a wide-brimmed soft fishing hat, while Churchill of course wore his familiar tweed cap.

The highlight of the Sunday meeting was the service held on the deck of the HMS *Prince of Wales*. The sky was clear, and the deck rose and fell with the rolling waves. The Prime Minister and the President prayed together for future justice and peace.

A certain dignitary who attended the service later told others: when the priests led the service and the sailors of the two countries sang the hymn "God Save the King," Churchill was extremely moved. Finally, he said loudly, "Although I am not a priest, I should thank God for being able to serve as Prime Minister at this time!"

Then the priests led the singing of "Onward, Christian Soldiers." The President and the Prime Minister joined in, but their voices were drowned out by the buzzing of patrolling aircraft overhead.

As for the British and American figures attending the meeting, on the President's side, in addition to his two sons serving as White House aides, there was Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, Chief of Staff and Air Force Commander General Arnold, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet Admiral King, Under Secretary of State Welles, Special Envoy for Implementing Aid to Civilian Fronts Hopkins, Harryman, London representative of the Administration for Implementing Aid to Civilian Fronts, as well as President's Secretary and Army Aide Major General Watson, Naval Aide Captain Peters, and Doctor McIntyre.

On Prime Minister Churchill's side, there was Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office Cadogan, Prime Minister's Scientific Advisor Cherwell, Minister of Supply Beaverbrook, Army Chief of Staff General Dill, Air Chief of Staff Freeman, and First Sea Lord Pound.

After the meeting, President Roosevelt returned to Oakland Harbor on the yacht *Potomac* on August 16, as mentioned above. Churchill returned to a certain port in Scotland on the *Prince of Wales* on August 19. The situation during the journey can be referred to in the records of the British warship reporter.

I was accompanying on the escorting destroyer, and all the way, we did not encounter any enemy aircraft or boats in the air or on the sea surface. It was truly a magical voyage. I never thought that the Prime Minister would cross the Atlantic, meet with President Roosevelt twice in a row, and return safely under the watchful eyes of the public. The officers on my ship scratched their heads in amazement when they heard the radio report that Prime Minister Churchill had returned to the country on the *Prince of Wales*.

In our view, this report was tantamount to openly challenging Hitler, because at that time, we were still hundreds of miles from the Atlantic, and there was a large section of sea where submarines lurked.

One warm afternoon, we set off from a certain naval port and headed straight for a certain point in the North Atlantic to meet with the *Prince of Wales*. At that time, no one on the ship except the captain knew the importance of the mission. After several days of sailing, one morning, we saw a wisp of thick smoke rising on the horizon. Gradually, we could see the massive outline of the battleship through binoculars, escorted by several Canadian destroyers on both sides. This giant ship was indeed magnificent, advancing through the Atlantic, its bow crashing against the waves, stirring up large patches of water and spray.

We caught up head-on. In a few minutes, my ship had turned around, slightly increasing its speed, so that it was in line with the main force and moving forward abreast with the other ships.

That afternoon, "Catalina" aircraft were patrolling overhead. One of them reported that a large convoy of nine to sixty merchant ships was heading towards England. The Prime Minister had never seen a large-scale convoy at sea, so we slightly changed our course and headed towards the convoy. After two or three hours, we saw the convoy appearing on the horizon. It was truly an unbelievable sight. As far as the eye could see, there were ships, oil tankers, cargo ships, supply ships, large ships, small ships, everything that could be imagined, all floating on the surface of the water.

They were arranged in teams, stretching for eight miles. Around them were escorting old cruisers and American-transferred destroyers, which took care of the slow-moving ships, preventing them from falling behind, and were ready to deal with lurking dangers at any time.

We sailed head-on into the convoy and then passed through the middle of the fleet. The escorting ships of the *Prince of Wales* also separately passed through the merchant fleet. As we passed through the merchant fleet, we saw that they had discovered the identity of the distinguished guests on our side. So we saw the crew on the other ships hang flags in a V-shape to show victory, while the rest stood on the deck cheering and waving.

The *Prince of Wales* was truly magnificent. She fired all her 14-inch guns into the air at once. If Churchill was startled by this, his reaction was far less intense than the excitement of the merchant fleet.

We went forward for about two miles beyond the merchant ships. The *Prince of Wales* and her escorting ships then turned around and passed through the merchant fleet again. At this time, all the merchant ships were raising their flags leisurely, and the sailors were standing in lines, while the passengers waved their hats and cheered. We wished them bon voyage and then returned to our original route, heading straight for Iceland. After anchoring in Iceland for a day, the Prime Minister inspected the British and American troops stationed there. That night, we sailed to a certain port in England.

### Rumors that British Advance into Caucasus Abandoned Due to Transport Difficulties; British Communists Demand Invasion of Europe; Hoare Urges Britain to Take Military Action

Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 3rd – According to reliable information obtained from well-informed sources in London by the London correspondent of *Ya Bao*, Ashiya, General Wavell's plan to send his troops to the Caucasus to assist the Russians has now been abandoned. Wavell had previously gone to Tbilisi to draft a plan with Russian staff officers for the British to send troops to the Caucasus to protect Russian interests in the Middle East. However, this has now been dropped due to transport difficulties and the fact that British troops taking the route through Persia to the Caucasus would affect British transport of materials to Russia. It is understood that the Soviet Union is now in dire need of arms and manpower. London military figures also acknowledge that the Soviets need British assistance in the Donets Basin, but transport difficulties have prevented the Soviets from getting what they want. The British military also believes that the Persian railway and highways are insufficient to transport 60,000 troops. Furthermore, the British military gun calibers are different from those of the Soviet military, so British troops operating in the Caucasus would have to carry all of their own weapons and ammunition. British mechanized units and air force cannot use Soviet fuel. There are various difficulties in British aid to the Soviet Union.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 3rd – The British ambassador to Spain, Sir Samuel Hoare, recently in Britain, delivered a speech yesterday in Reeth, supporting public opinion in Britain and advocating military action to demonstrate Britain's strength to the world, so as not to lose its prestige. He stated that his impression of Madrid was that it was one of the few places on the European continent where one could observe the European situation. If Britain wants to convince Europe that Britain will win in this war, it must show Europe that Britain can not only resist Germany at sea, but also meet it on land and in the air.

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 3rd – The leader of the British Communist Party, Harry Pollitt, at a public meeting in Bristol, demanded the establishment of a front in Western Europe. The meeting was attended by 3,000 people. He said that Hitler's army would have to be surrounded one day. He acknowledged that establishing a second front in Western Europe would sacrifice many British lives.

### Pope to Convene Religious Council; Appointment of a Batch of Bishops

Haitong News Agency, Vatican City, 3rd – According to information from here, Pope Pius XII will convene a religious council in the second half of December, without appointing cardinal archbishops, only a batch of bishops.

### Dutch People's Food Supplies Scraped Clean

TASS, London, 3rd – A Dutch mechanic who recently escaped to England said that the food situation in the Netherlands is terrible, and most people are now starving. Farmers refuse to sell goods to the Germans, who transport everything they can seize to Germany. Domestic reserves in the Netherlands are almost completely exhausted. As of September, the total amount of debt owed by the Germans in the Dutch bank was 679 million gold, compared to 20 million before the occupation. The people are extremely worried and are trying in various ways to harm the Germans and help the Allied countries. Mass arrests are being carried out in the Netherlands. The public is generally indifferent to the question of who will win the war, only wishing for an early end, the sooner the better. Austrian soldiers also hate the Germans extremely. The mechanic said, "I personally witnessed the commotion at Rotterdam station. When the occupying troops were leaving for the front, the soldiers were unwilling to get on the train and only did so under the threat of pistols." He concluded, "We Dutch people all trust our government temporarily stationed in London and firmly believe that the day of our country's freedom is not far off."

### Germany Continues Atrocities in Southern Countries

TASS, New York, 3rd – According to reports received by the New York Times correspondent in Luanda from foreign military circles, the occupying forces in Yugoslavia are continuing to commit atrocities. The Italian military court in Sibenik sentenced 18 Croats to death for inciting strikes and participating in guerrilla warfare. In Belgrade, the German authorities also arrested 1,500 suspects, with one or two dozen being executed every day.

### Situation in France Increasingly Tense; 3,000 Workers Imprisoned in Concentration Camps

TASS, Moscow, 3rd – The situation in France is becoming increasingly tense, and the German authorities are intensifying their intimidation. Recently, 3,000 French workers have been arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps. Workers who strike in various factories have been placed inside the factories under surveillance, surrounded by electric wires. Anyone who tries to escape will be shot.

TASS, Moscow, 3rd – The German authorities in Nantes are conducting house-to-house searches in order to capture the criminals who assassinated General Holtz. As a result of this incident, five French citizens have been arrested in Vichy, and 14 people have been arrested in Paris.

### US Plans to Open New Route to Aid Soviet Union

Havas, Washington, 2nd – The *Evening Star* recently reported that the US government is preparing to open a regular shipping line between US ports and the Persian Gulf. Once this measure is implemented, it will greatly benefit the US in providing the Soviet Union with military equipment. It is also learned that the US Maritime Commission has already drawn up a plan for this, and it is expected that the first ship will soon depart from a certain port on the east coast of the United States, sailing to Bandar Shahpur in the Persian Gulf. Thereafter, the number of tanks, airplanes, and artillery provided by the United States to the Soviet Union will inevitably increase accordingly.

### Turkey Resolved to Resist Any Coercive Action; President's Speech Warns Belligerent Nations

Reuters, Ankara, 3rd – The Turkish President issued a long-awaited speech at the opening of the Parliament's winter session on Saturday, warning both belligerent parties that Turkey will resist any coercive action taken against it. As soon as these words were spoken, the parliamentarians burst into thunderous applause, standing up and cheering in welcome. There is not only no doubt here about Britain's intentions, but there is also satisfaction with the strengthening of the British Empire in the Near East and Middle East. The Turkish people understand that the strong British presence on Turkey's eastern border helps to ensure Turkey's neutrality. Therefore, the President's remarks are clearly a warning to Berlin, meaning that if Germany demands that German troops transit through Turkey or use Turkish Black Sea bases to attack the Caucasus or northern Iran, Turkey will firmly refuse this and, if necessary, will back this refusal with arms. The Turkish President repeatedly stated that the guiding principles of Turkey's foreign policy are loyalty to obligations, alliances, and friendships. This can be seen in Turkey's attitude towards Britain when France was defeated and Britain was in its darkest hour. The Turkish President's remarks on the independence of the Balkan countries will be unwelcome in Berlin, as they imply non-acceptance of the German New Order. The President's address was praised by Parliament, which is noteworthy, because the parliamentarians are not "yes-men" but freely elected representatives who, if necessary, can freely condemn the government to an extent impossible in authoritarian countries.

### US Sends Detectives to Protect President's Youngest Son's Residence

Reuters, Los Angeles, 3rd – The director of the Secret Service in this area announced today that detectives have been sent to protect the residence of the President's youngest son, John Roosevelt. John Roosevelt, his wife, and their 16-month-old child live in Coronado, California. The director of the Secret Service refused to answer questions about whether someone was planning to kidnap the child, but said that two people who were seen peeking into the home of John Roosevelt had been arrested and sentenced to five days in jail each.

### International Briefs

United Press International, Tokyo, 3rd – The Asahi Shimbun's Bangkok correspondent reported today that Britain's recent completion of Burmese defense is to contain the anti-British movement in that area. Due to the Burmese launching the "Burma Belongs to the Burmese" movement, the British were forced to take extreme measures to preserve their rule.

Havas News Agency, New Delhi, 3rd – The Min Sheng Jiang Tan newspaper reported that the American Red Cross plans to send a ship loaded with one million US dollars worth of medicine and a large quantity of condensed milk, baby clothing, etc., to the occupied areas of France to help French refugees. It is also learned that the ship is scheduled to sail to Marseilles on the 20th, and it is rumored that the British have approved its passage through the blockade line.

Havas News Agency, Paris, 3rd – A train collision occurred at the Austerlitz station here today, resulting in 20 deaths and 48 injuries, with five passenger cars overturned off the tracks.

### Circular from the Colonial Superintendent of Chinese Education: Wartime Allowance for Chinese Schools; Government Subsidy Paid in One Lump Sum; Chinese Schools Receive Over $190,000

(Singapore Correspondence) – Due to the impact of the war, the price of goods in Malaya has increased three to fourfold. The teachers of Chinese schools in Malaya, who have always lived a hard life, have been requesting improvements in their treatment and the issuance of wartime allowances due to the rising prices and the inability to maintain their livelihoods. This situation has been reported in previous news. Recently, the Straits Settlements Superintendent of Chinese Education, in view of this situation and the fact that government agencies and some wealthy merchants have measures in place to provide wartime allowances to their employees, has issued a circular to the boards of directors of all Chinese schools, requesting them to酌量 provide wartime allowances to teachers so that they can maintain their livelihoods and avoid reducing the effectiveness of education. As for the subsidy granted to each school by the local government from the 1% increase in property tax, according to the previous method, the subsidy for the second half of 1940 was issued in May or August 1941, and the subsidy for the first half of 1941 was issued in October or November of the same year. The Superintendent has now changed to issuing it all together in September and October, so that Chinese schools can avoid the trouble of receiving it in installments and can also formulate an annual plan based on this. According to the Superintendent of Chinese Education's conversation with reporters, there are currently a total of 39 subsidized Chinese schools in Singapore, with a total subsidy of $94,234.20; 34 in Penang, with a total subsidy of $78.42.50; and 9 in Malacca, with a total subsidy of $18.16. In total, there are 82 schools with a subsidy of $191,271.70.

### Hong Kong Education Committee Discusses Establishing a Rural Teachers' College and Discusses Issues Related to the Facilities of Chinese Schools

(Hong Kong Correspondence) – The Hong Kong Education Committee held its 126th meeting last week. During the meeting, the urgent need for facilities for junior Chinese schools was discussed. As a result, it was unanimously decided to submit a proposal to the Hong Kong government for takeover.

Regarding the issue of facilities for junior Chinese schools in the New Territories, it was decided to request the government to establish a rural teacher training college as soon as possible. At the same time, the issue of statistics on the number of students from Chinese universities in Hong Kong, as well as the question of whether school medical officers and dentists should be directly managed by the Education Department, were also raised for discussion.

### Hunan Shaoyang Xinhua Improves Papermaking Training; Construction Department Sends Technicians for On-site Guidance

(Leiyang Correspondence) – Shaoyang and Xinhua counties in Hunan are the most abundant areas for bamboo production. In the Qiutianpu area of Shaoyang, the mountains overlap and bamboo and arrow bamboo are everywhere. Residents rely on this for their livelihoods. In addition to construction and manufacturing utensils, papermaking is particularly prevalent. Paper vats are scattered in each household, with one to three vats, or four to five vats, and some reaching more than ten vats. However, the manufacturing process is all done using indigenous methods, with crude techniques, high costs, and low yields. In order to improve the papermaking technology of the people, the Hunan Construction Department specially dispatched technical instructors Qiu Zhonghe from the Handicraft Improvement Committee to Shaoyang and Xinhua to provide on-site guidance and established a joint papermaking cooperative in Qiutianpu to begin improving papermaking training. At present, the cooperative's improved paper products such as kraft paper, writing paper, newsprint, and jade paper are all of excellent quality. The Construction Department has now designated Qiutianpu as a demonstration area for Shaoyang and Daping (belonging to Xinhua) as a demonstration area for Xinhua, holding collective improved papermaking training and guiding papermaking households to promote the paper industry in a cooperative manner.

### Third Installment of Chinese School Subsidies Issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Yesterday; Fourth Installment Scheduled for Next Spring

### National Conservatory of Music Classes Continue as Usual in Shanghai; Not Relocated Inland, Nor Changed to Private Status

(Dahua News Agency) – The National Conservatory of Music moved from the downtown area to the concession after the outbreak of the "August 13th" incident and continued classes as usual. Due to environmental factors, it rarely engages in activities other than academic and technical research. The annual music festival has also been suspended. Outsiders are unaware of this, leading to various misunderstandings, some believing that the school has been suspended or relocated inland, and others confusing it with the "Private Shanghai Conservatory of Music" on Avenue Joffre and Route Winling. In fact, the "Private Conservatory of Music" was originally founded by students of the National Conservatory of Music, and many of its teachers are also graduates of the National Conservatory of Music. It was originally named "Shanghai Music Hall" and is now planning to reorganize into the "Private Shanghai Conservatory of Music," but the Ministry of Education has not approved its registration and has ordered the school not to use the place name "Shanghai" or the name "Conservatory of Music," but can only be called "Music Vocational School" or "Music Tutoring School." The "Shanghai Conservatory of Music" holding a concert at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge area in the near future is a private one, not the National Conservatory of Music.

### Yiyou Cup Table Tennis Finals: Li Zaichun Wins Championship

In the first game, Li Zaichun defeated the young general Yang Changjia. In the second game, Zhang Junyuan defeated Yang Changxi. The Yang brothers have been diligent in their studies recently, and their skills have been slightly rusty, resulting in defeats in the third and fourth games. In the fifth game, Li Feixiang fought Zhang Junyuan. The two sides were evenly matched, and many wonderful balls were played. In the end, Zhang won by perseverance. At this stage of the game, the two Lis and one Zhang had equal scores. A round-robin tournament was used to determine the champion by drawing lots.

### Middle School Volleyball Ends Early; Ten Games This Weekend

### Speculation and Hoarding Lead to Huge Profits; Purchasing Power Drops Sharply; Hoarders Make Profits Through Resale, Sales Are Sluggish; Stored Rice Will Be Subject to Time Limit for Release; Retail Price of Cigarettes Soars, Wholesale Price Unchanged

According to authoritative sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council's request to the Consular Body for approval to add additional clauses to the land regulations to manage prices in the city and to prevent speculation and profiteering is purely a technical matter. Therefore, whether or not the Consular Body will approve it, and whether the approval will be sooner or later, is not considered important. It is now believed that the Consular Body will definitely approve it within this week. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council's various preparatory work for managing prices will proceed according to the planned schedule. After the British firm Peake & Co. accepted the Shanghai Municipal Council General Manager Felibee's commission to register importers and manufacturers in this city on the 1st of this month, as of yesterday, nine importers and manufacturers in this city have registered with the firm in writing. It is expected that importers and manufacturers in this city, in consideration of the authorities' intention to suppress prices and for the sake of the legitimate development of their own businesses, will continue to register.

### Sales of Goods Are Becoming Increasingly Narrow

Shanghai is the general hub of industry and commerce in our country. The rise and fall of trade and the prosperity and decline of the market have always been noted by people at home and abroad. However, since the war, merchants have taken advantage of the opportunity to raise prices and make profits, and the entire commercial industry has suffered severe threats, becoming worse and worse, and is no longer what it used to be. However, due to the soaring prices and the sharp increase in the cost of living, the general middle and lower class residents are becoming increasingly financially distressed, and most of them are saving on daily expenses, and rarely buy new clothes. Purchasing power has declined accordingly. It is rumored that some wealthy merchants buy exquisite items, but this is a minority. The sales of each industry are becoming increasingly sluggish, and the circulation of existing goods is extremely stagnant. Some shops are already trying to sell off large quantities of hoarded goods at this high price, hoping to reverse the downward trend. However, residents are ultimately unwilling to buy due to financial constraints. It is learned that the four banks of the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks have recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance to support the development of agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining, as well as to suppress prices and stabilize the market. (1) Provide loans to the extent possible for the funds needed by agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining that are actually related to war resistance and construction production. (2) Provide foreign exchange required for legitimate commerce in accordance with the prescribed exchange rate to suppress prices. (3) Promote agricultural loans to deepen the use of funds and spread it to rural areas. (4) Give premium rewards to various banks at ports for the inward remittance of funds to the interior. (5) The Central Trust Bureau should undertake wartime insurance as much as possible so that the production undertakings in the rear can develop in an orderly manner. (6) Promote savings business and promote people's frugality.

20,000 Bags of Fair-Priced Rice Arrived Yesterday

The Shanghai Municipal Council's fair-priced foreign rice is continuing to arrive in Shanghai in large quantities. The Taikoo Company's Jinan transport arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying 13,210 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, of which 10,000 bags were the Shanghai Municipal Council's fair-priced foreign rice, and the remainder were cargo. In addition, the Jardine Matheson's Yusheng transport arrived in Shanghai at 3:30 PM yesterday, also carrying 11,628 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Except for 1,428 bags of cargo, the remaining 10,200 bags were also the Shanghai Municipal Council's fair-priced foreign rice. The Jinan transport stopped at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, and the Yusheng transport docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. Unloading was carried out overnight yesterday.

Stored Rice Will Be Subject to Management

The middle and lower class civilians in the city hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council will uphold its original intention and make every effort to increase the number of places (rice shops) selling rice to civilians so that they can purchase it nearby every day. It is also learned that the two authorities are actively discussing measures for rice merchants to store rice. Any rice merchants who purchase any rice from overseas or domestically and transport it to Shanghai for storage will be limited to half a year or two or three months. If the stored grain is not released for market sales within the specified period, it will be deemed illegal hoarding and will be severely investigated according to law. At the same time, after the rice arrives in port, the holder of the goods must submit a detailed list to the two authorities, including the name of the rice, the name of the goods owner, the name of the storage warehouse, the detailed address, and the date of storage. The purpose of this move by the authorities is to crack down on illegal hoarding and speculation and to increase the supply of spot goods in the market in order to stabilize people's hearts and stabilize the rice market. The implementation of this measure is said to be not far off. At that time, rice profiteers will suffer a severe blow.

### Cigarette Price Hikes Lead to Huge Profits

According to the 中中 Tobacco Company and the 大大 Taihe Tobacco Company, the personnel responsible have revealed that the cigarette shops in this city are making huge profits by selling cigarettes at high prices. They stated that the wholesale price of first-class American cigarettes, such as Chesterfield and Lucky Strikes, is on average 1.07 yuan per pack of 20. However, the retail prices range from 1.50 yuan to 3.20 yuan. Chesterfield, Lucky Strikes, White Tin Packs, Yellow Tin Packs, and Three Gunpowder are sold by 乃永泰和 Company to cigarette shops. The selling price is calculated in US dollars. The 中中 Company, which manufactures these cigarettes, has a portion of its foreign exchange for transporting tobacco supplied by the Stabilization Fund. Therefore, over the past three months, the retail price of cigarettes has soared by sixfold, but the wholesale price has not changed.

Wholesale Price Has Not Changed

For example, Chesterfield and Lucky Strikes are still US$2.80 per hundred packs, and the legal price is 1.07 yuan per pack. However, according to yesterday morning's investigation, Chesterfield and Lucky Strikes are sold in cigarette retail stores for 2.80 yuan or more per pack, while cigarette wholesale stores sell them for 1.50 yuan to 2.50 yuan. In some bars, Chesterfield is sold for 3 yuan and Camel for 2 yuan. Therefore, the average profit of retail stores is more than double. Tobacco companies admit that there is no excuse for the soaring price of cigarettes. However, it is disclosed that the 中中 Company has joined forces with the Shanghai Municipal Council to study ways to suppress the price of cigarettes. The goods side believes that the Shanghai Municipal Council's failure to take drastic measures is not effective, and the Consular Body has delayed approving the Shanghai Municipal Council's request to order new supplementary rules to give the Bureau new weapons to suppress profiteering. As a result, the price situation has not improved. Shanghai Municipal Council General Manager and President Felibee refused to comment or make any comments on this matter.

Managing Cigarette Prices Is Being Considered

According to a member of the Yongtaihe Company, the profits made by cigarette retailers are huge. The company is now considering cooperating with the Shanghai Municipal Council to manage cigarette prices. The cigarette prices set by cigarette retailers vary widely, which proves that they are not priced within a reasonable range. A large store in the central area has set a reasonable selling price of 1.50 yuan for Chesterfield and 1.60 yuan for Lucky Strikes. Prices are even higher elsewhere. When asked why the selling price has soared, they say that the black market US dollar price has increased. In fact, the wholesale price, which is set at 1.07 yuan, has been in place for three months. Another cigarette wholesale store sells Chesterfield for 2 yuan and Lucky Strikes for 2.5 yuan. Some also sell Chesterfield, Camel, and Lucky Strikes for 2.20 yuan. Still others say that Lucky Strikes cannot be purchased. However, a member of the Yizhong Company said that the cigarettes sold by the company are sufficient for Shanghai's normal needs, and the prices of cheaper cigarettes have also soared, such as 等等 and other American cigarettes.

### Fair-Priced Rice Limited to One Dou Per Purchase Starting Today

The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that the Bureau has issued a notice to restrict the sale of fair-priced rice, stating that from today onwards, until another notice is issued, the amount of Bureau's foreign rice sold by any rice shop to an individual shall not exceed one dou, etc. It is understood that the purpose of this measure is to prevent hoarders from storing up rice. As for the rice stored in this city, the inventory is abundant enough to meet all normal needs. More batches of rice are on their way to Shanghai.

### Construction Workers Transported to China Were All Fired; Japanese Hire New Workers; Forced to Sail to Moji to Dredge the Port

The Japanese side forcibly leased the giant dredger Construction No. to Moji to dredge the port, forcing all the crew members to follow the ship to be transferred there. After the crew members discovered this, all of them left the ship to protest. The Japanese side then sent troops and water patrol police to guard the ship, and arrested two crew members. The Russian chief mate of the ship was also forcibly dismissed for sympathizing with the Chinese crew members, and the Mud Dredging Bureau was forced to recruit new workers to replace the crew members, insisting on forcibly transferring them. The Japanese crew members of the Lilian vessel, who were recently transferred to Construction No. to replace the Russian chief mate, are carrying out the recruitment of new workers, and it has not been made public.

All Dismissed

According to a report from the Datong News Agency reporter, the recruitment of new workers has been completed, and they all reported to the Mud Dredging Bureau yesterday and went to the ship to practice. The bureau has ordered the original workers to hand over their uniforms and announced their dismissal from this month onwards. The crew members were extremely angry when they learned of this and decided to carry out their opposition to the transfer and refuse the unjustified dismissal. It is learned that the newly recruited workers, together with the retained Norwegian shipowner Kloss, the Japanese chief mate (i.e., the shipowner of Lilian), and the Japanese chief engineer, are now actively practicing driving the ship and various techniques such as towing and dredging, and are scheduled to leave Shanghai with the ship and sail to Moji on the 12th of this month.

Two Arrested

As for the two Chinese crew members of the Construction No., Zhu Mujin, 30 years old, from Wusong, and Zhang Along, 28 years old, also from Wusong, who were arrested by the Japanese side, were initially detained in the Water Hotel and have recently been moved elsewhere and have not been released. The Japanese side accused them of inciting suspicion and arrested them. Now the families of the two men are going to the Junpu Bureau every day to request them to negotiate with the Japanese side for their release.

### Hongkou and Nanshi Recruit Chinese Laborers to Be Transported to Hainan

Several hundred Chinese coolies recruited by the Japanese side here, who will go to Hainan Island as laborers, have boarded a Japanese ship and left Shanghai on the afternoon of the two days. These people are the first batch of coolies recruited by the Japanese in Hongkou and Nanshi. Posters are now pasted in the streets of Hongkou and Nanshi, tempting laborers to go to Hainan Island to engage in farming work with an average daily wage of four yuan. Each laborer only receives a settlement fee of 20 yuan when departing. Workers engaged in handicrafts have higher wages.

### The Location of the Proposed Beggar Shelter Is Quite Suitable

The plan to set up a beggar shelter in the suburbs of Shanghai to accommodate 10,000 beggars is still in the undecided stage. However, according to reliable sources, the location of the shelter is quite suitable. It is located on Gordon Road, next to the Model Village near the Central Reorganization Factory across the Suzhou Creek. There are about 350 rooms inside, all facing south, with modern facilities such as mansions and showers. At present, the village only needs light repairs such as installing huts and can be converted into a beggar shelter. If it can be established next spring, the Singapore Road beggar shelters run by the Rotary Club and the Salvation Army will be closed.

### Jiang Qian Explains the True Nature of the Mind: A Lecture at the Chinese Vocational School Sutra Class

A human life spans a hundred years, during which one sees countless things, but the only thing unseen is this true mind. This true mind is the true self; without it, there is no sight, no hearing, no speech, no movement. It is as pure as the void, illuminating the sun and moon, neither arising nor ceasing. This is the essence of the mind. It penetrates the three realms vertically and pervades the ten directions horizontally, boundless and limitless. This is the form of the mind. It remains unchanged through countless eons, yet readily adapts to conditions, manifesting illusions while its essence remains constant. When released, it fills the universe; when concealed, it is formless. It is swift without rushing, arriving without traveling. This is the function of the mind. Essence, form, and function together are called the three great aspects of the mind. To revere it is to call it divine; to discuss it is to call it sage; to praise it is to call it wondrous; to admire it is to call it beautiful. It is called Buddha, Confucian, Zen, Pure Land, Discipline, Doctrine, Islam, Christianity, wisdom, foolishness, nobility, lowliness, male, female, old, young, good, evil, beauty, ugliness, fortune, misfortune, longevity, brevity, joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, classics, histories, philosophical works, collections of writings, songs, poems, prose. It produces various names and manifests various forms, like a pure, real pearl placed in a five-colored dish, reflecting colors according to its surroundings, all illusions and not real. It is also like pure gold, manifesting different forms according to conditions—a gold Buddha, a gold figure, a gold plate, a gold beast—but the essence of the gold does not change into copper. Therefore, Buddha-nature is likened to diamond; all sentient beings possess Buddha-nature. The mind, Buddha, and sentient beings are ultimately no different. The key to ascent and descent lies in this one thought. Restrain your thoughts, and you become a sage; indulge your thoughts, and you become a madman. If you wish to avoid madness, there is nothing better than to contemplate the Buddha. The Buddha is without limit, the Buddha is of boundless life. Know that contemplating the Buddha is contemplating the true mind. Although one is born in the Pure Land, one does not go outside the mind. Because the mind is without obstacles, one can be born wherever one wishes. Thoughts arise from external conditions and create distinctions, like reflections in a mirror. The six sense objects (form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and dharma) are called the six conditions. When the conditions are pure, the reflection is pure; when the conditions are defiled, the reflection is defiled, but the light of the mirror remains pure and unmoving. The reflection is used to symbolize thoughts, and the mirror to symbolize the mind. Essence is the substance of mind and thought, and function is the use of thought in the mind. Although essence and function are distinct, they are inseparable. The way to establish oneself as a person is called benevolence and righteousness. Benevolence and righteousness have an essence, and because the essence does not change, it is said to dwell in benevolence and righteousness. Benevolence has a function, and because the function adapts to conditions, it is said to follow righteousness. The great paths of Buddhism and Confucianism are nothing more than benevolence and righteousness. Confucianism elaborates on the worldly, while Buddhism elaborates on the otherworldly. Their applications may be broad or narrow, but their essence and function are the same. Those who do not understand Confucianism cannot understand Buddhism, and only by studying Buddhism can one then understand Confucianism. By mastering this one section, you will understand all dharmas. A verse explains it:

All phenomena arise from thoughts,
As the mind writes objects, objects take form.
The six realms of mortals and the four realms of sages are all written by the mind,
Even Buddhas were once sentient beings.
Sometimes formed into a gold Buddha, sometimes a gold figure,
Gold ware, gold plates, all are gold.
Meeting a craftsman, it can change in myriad ways according to conditions,
But how could the nature of gold ever turn into silver?

### Armed Italian Soldiers Withdraw from the Steamship Tommaseo: Japanese Claim the Use of Force Was a Last Resort, Fearing Disturbances in Shanghai

At the request of the Japanese naval authorities, the Italian authorities yesterday morning withdrew the armed Italian soldiers stationed on the steamship Tommaseo. The Japanese naval authorities issued a statement to the press yesterday morning regarding the ship's detention, stating in brief:

Japanese Fear That This Will Stir Up Trouble

"The Japanese government and the Japanese naval authorities are both adhering to the policy of striving to prevent the European war from spreading to the Far East," said a Japanese naval officer. "In April of this year, when the Italian authorities first attempted to occupy the Tommaseo, the Japanese navy lodged a strong protest. Afterwards, the Italian authorities notified the Japanese side that they had received a telegram from Rome stating that the Italian side had legally purchased the ship. At that time, it was believed that the matter had come to an end. To avoid causing any disputes, a certain Japanese official stated this morning that regardless of the circumstances of the ship's purchase, the use of force, in terms of maintaining peace and order in the Far East, is ultimately a last resort. The Japanese navy wishes to avoid disturbances, especially in Shanghai, and to avoid future difficulties. Therefore, it requested the Italian side to voluntarily withdraw its soldiers from the Tommaseo, which was carried out this morning."

Crew's Clothing and Belongings All Removed

A unit of Italian soldiers stationed in Shanghai boarded the Italian steamship Tommaseo in the Huangpu River last week. As of the day before yesterday, it was still being detained. The clothing and other personal belongings of the ship's crew, with a total value of over 75,000 yuan, have also not been removed. After the crew members were forced off the ship by the Italian soldiers with pistols, they are now staying at the Navy YMCA. These individuals are all destitute, and their replacement clothing is being temporarily supplied by Captain Baovolini and the Shanghai management office of the ship. Baovolini consulted with a certain important Japanese official in the Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Section. The Japanese official said that he could not take any action regarding the transfer of the Tommaseo's flag, because this was a matter between the ship's owner and the purchasing company. However, the "improper" action of the Italian soldiers seizing the ship will be investigated, he said.

Italian Soldiers Indulging in Drink, Taking Whatever They Want

It was learned last night that the Italian soldiers on the steamship Tommaseo had already withdrawn and handed the ship over to crew members dispatched from the Italian mail ship Conte Verde to be responsible for its safekeeping. This morning, a Japanese naval motorboat was docked next to the Tommaseo, and two Japanese sailors were seen standing at the ship's doorway. The full details are not yet known. It is generally believed that the wine that the Italian soldiers drank wildly on the Tommaseo on Saturday belonged to the ship's senior crew members. Therefore, the crew members are quite concerned that their clothing and other belongings left on the ship will also be "requisitioned." One crew member said that since the Italian soldiers forcibly occupied the ship and freely drank the senior crew members' wine, the crew members' other possessions would probably also be seized. When the Italian soldiers first boarded the ship, they were impatient from hunger and demanded food, saying that they did not like the food on the Conte Verde.

Ship's Captain Has Already Submitted a Formal Statement

It is reported that the captain of the steamship Tommaseo has reported the ship's seizure in detail to the appropriate authorities, stating that the Italian side's claim that they are legally the owners of the Tommaseo is completely unfounded. The captain holds a telegram from the true shipowner in New York, instructing him not to have any dealings with the Italians, as the ship is still owned by the Southerners. It has been confirmed that Captain Baovolini was summoned to the Italian consulate on Tuesday afternoon to meet with the Italian consul, another official, Major Scafati, and representatives from the Italian mail ship company. The Italians asked him to hand over the control of the Tommaseo, on the grounds that the ship had been purchased by the Italian mail ship company. However, when Baovolini asked for documents proving the purchase of the ship, the Italians could not produce any. Baovolini also telephoned the Italian embassy in Croat to inquire and received a reply stating, "The Tommaseo has not been transferred to any shipping company."

### French Electric Copper Workers Request Mediation, Successfully Achieving a 40% Pay Raise: Agreement Reached, North-China Daily News Labor Dispute Being Negotiated

Approximately several dozen Chinese employees of the North-China Daily News on the Bund, citing the recent increase in the cost of living and their insufficient income to support their families, recently requested a salary increase and subsidies from the newspaper's management. As the management did not provide a satisfactory response, they went on strike yesterday morning around 10:00 AM. It is reported that the newspaper has already negotiated with the employee representatives once yesterday, and it is possible that work will resume immediately. It is also learned that over 700 coppersmiths at the French Commercial Water and Electricity Company previously sent representatives last month to petition the company's management for a wage increase of 50 yuan per person. Without a satisfactory resolution, the French Concession Police Department's political affairs section, fearing the escalation of the situation, mediated and actively facilitated a resolution, which resulted in the employer agreeing to increase all original salaries by 40%. The employees deemed this satisfactory and reached an agreement.

### Long-Distance Telephone Charges Doubled

According to news from the Shanghai Postal Administration Bureau yesterday, the Ministry of Communications, due to the soaring prices of electrical materials to avoid excessive losses, submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which approved the doubling of long-distance telephone rates from November 1st of this year, according to the current rates. The measures are as follows: (1) From November 1st of the 30th year of the Republic (1941), long-distance telephone rates should be calculated at four times the standard rate (i.e., double the current rate), and new rates should be established (for example, the standard rate from Chongqing to Chengdu is 1.40 yuan, and the current rate is 5.80 yuan. The new rate should be set at 5.60 yuan). All rates less than 1.00 yuan should be increased to 1.00 yuan. (2) Each administration bureau should formulate new rates, calculated at four times the standard rate, and submit them to the Directorate General of Telecommunications for approval as the telephone rates. (3) All rates approved by the Directorate General of Telecommunications on September 16th of this year should be calculated at four times the standard rate. When these rates are entered into the new rate table, they should not be changed. However, all rates approved by the Directorate General of Telecommunications before September 16th should be revised and included in the new rate table. (4) For calls through the Ministry and Provincial Telephone Exchange, the Ministry's exchange section rates should all be handled in accordance with the provisions of item 1.

### Stability of the Legal Tender in Shanghai to Be Discussed: Reports of No Longer Maintaining the Shanghai Exchange Rate Are Categorically Denied; Consultations in the Capital Have Concluded Successfully

American economic expert Kirkland arrived in Shanghai last Saturday to discuss foreign exchange issues with the Shanghai banking community. He returned to Hong Kong on the Hanyang steamship the day before yesterday to report back. It is said that Kirkland was originally scheduled to stay in Shanghai for two weeks, but he only stayed for a week before going south because the members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund and British economic expert Niemeyer are currently gathered in Hong Kong and will convene an important meeting in mid-month. Kirkland was invited and had to attend. It is reported that the focus of this decisive meeting is to discuss stabilizing the legal tender issue in Shanghai. A responsible party told the Dagong News Agency reporter yesterday that since the British and American economic experts arrived in Chongqing, they have repeatedly consulted with Chinese officials and achieved satisfactory results. Since Kirkland came to Shanghai to exchange views with the Shanghai banking community, the status of the legal tender has become more stable. Some time ago, rumors that the Chinese government would no longer maintain the exchange rate of the Shanghai legal tender were completely unfounded, and the government has clearly denied this.

Furthermore, according to information the reporter obtained from foreign sources, the Exchange Stabilization Fund has formulated methods for supplying foreign exchange to various inland areas and has notified the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China. The main points are as follows: 1. After September 15, 1941, all banks listed in licenses 60 and 61 of the U.S. Treasury Department may supply foreign exchange at a rate of US$5.34375 for goods imported into Free China. 2. Banks authorized by the British Treasury Department may supply foreign exchange at a rate of £3.1875 for goods imported into Free China. 3. When importing goods require U.S. dollars and British pounds, applications may be submitted to the authorized banks, which will forward them to the Chongqing or Hong Kong offices of the Exchange Stabilization Fund for review. 4. To facilitate small-scale imports, with the exception of prohibited items, for items not exceeding US$2,000 or £500, the authorized British and American banks may be responsible for handling the supply of foreign exchange. 5. Foreign exchange may be supplied for small amounts of travel expenses and insurance fees, etc., for individuals, not exceeding US$200 or £50.

### Extortion at a Sauce and Pickle Shop: Two Criminals Captured

The Wan Zhen Xin Sauce and Pickle Shop on Huanghe Road in the French Concession received a phone call on the 31st of last month, claiming that the caller wanted to buy a case of kerosene and asking the shop to send someone to a certain address on Wenmiao Road in the city. The manager instructed apprentice Shen A'er (16 years old, from Ningbo) to deliver the goods to the address. Unexpectedly, after the apprentice left, he disappeared without a trace. It is understood that the shop received a threatening letter a few days ago, demanding 10,000 yuan and instructing the shop to send it to a certain location on Wenmiao Road in the South City as soon as possible. After the apprentice's disappearance, there was a clue, so the shop reported it to the French Concession Police, which dispatched Inspector Lu Zhulin and several detectives, including Zhen Lin and Wu Yuelin, in disguise. After waiting for some time, they arrested two bandits, identified as Hong Xiheng, 26 years old, and Wang Wenzhi, 50 years old, both from Ningbo, and brought them back to the French Concession Police Station for investigation. The apprentice, Shen A'er, was hidden in the Xujiahui area and was reportedly released from the bandit den on the 2nd of this month.

### A Man Killed in a Hit-and-Run Accident

Cui Changsheng, 35 years old, from Zhoupu, Nanhui, was walking in front of 1532 Avenue Joffre at 4:30 AM yesterday morning when he was struck by a car traveling from east to west. He fell and injured the back of his head, losing consciousness. The car fled the scene after the accident. A patrolman discovered the body and reported it to the police station, which sent a detective to search his body and found a citizen's card and a photograph. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but he died before he could be saved. The body was taken to the coroner's office. Since there were no family members, the body was prepared for burial by the charity organization to await family members to claim it.

### Rumors of a Merchant Kidnapped on Route Mettehers

A kidnapping case occurred on Route Mettehers yesterday. The victim was reportedly a sand and gravel merchant who lived at 587 Lane, Half No. 7 on that road. However, when questioned, the residents of that address firmly stated that there was no such person and that no one had been kidnapped. Therefore, the name of the kidnapped person could not be ascertained. It is said that around 10:30 AM yesterday, a car suddenly arrived at the entrance of 57 Lane (i.e., Junwei Lane) on Route Mettehers. After stopping abruptly, two men jumped out of the car, went straight into the lane, and dragged a man from the house at No. 17 into the car, and drove away quickly. After learning of the incident, the Gordon Road Police Station immediately dispatched detectives to investigate.

### Zhu Zixiang's Memorial Service to Be Held

Mr. Zhu Zixiang, a standing committee member of the Grain and Miscellaneous Goods Association and a leading figure in the bean and rice industry, was a kind and upright man. In the past, he opened a dedicated wharf for the rice industry in the South City and built warehouses and stacking yards, which attracted many rice and grain sources to Shanghai, making significant contributions. After the incident, he lived a simple life and did not seek exorbitant profits. He supported the authorities in establishing public associations and organizing price stabilization, benefiting the poor. Unfortunately, he passed away on September 13th, leaving behind two sons and two daughters. The eldest son works at the Mecali Bank, and the adopted son works at the Xichuan Enterprise Company. It is now heard that the memorial service will be held on November 11th at the Jingtu Temple on Guling Road. It is expected that the solemn occasion will be marked by white horses and plain carriages.

### Cruise Ship from the East Indies to Arrive in Shanghai: Texaco's Oil Allocation May Increase

An oil tanker sailing from the Dutch East Indies is expected to arrive in Shanghai, improving the gasoline situation in the city. Texaco Oil Company is currently only issuing oil allocation certificates for the first week of this month to car owners. It is reported that when the expected quantity of gasoline arrives, Texaco may increase the oil allocation for the remaining three weeks of the month. The oil allocation quota implemented in September was already 20% lower than in previous months. Currently, personnel from the three major foreign oil companies in the city say they do not know when the oil tanker will arrive. Meanwhile, Asiatic Petroleum Company and Socony Oil Company have also issued oil allocation certificates for this month, which are still 20-25% lower than the oil allocation quota in September. It is reported that as a result of the implementation of the oil allocation system, the total amount of gasoline consumed in the city in October has decreased by 20% compared to that consumed in September.

### Autumn Colors in the Huang Garden

— Zhou Ainong

On Route Kaufmann in the French Concession, it is as quiet as a church. The first thing that catches your eye when getting off the tram is a red arrow sign with the words "Chrysanthemum Exhibition" on it. Following the direction indicated, you slowly stroll along. On both sides, the withered yellow leaves of the roadside trees cannot withstand the impact of the autumn wind and fall rustling to the ground. After all, the autumn scenery is getting old. There are very few pedestrians coming and going on the road, as if one were not on this isolated island. After walking for a while, a branch road paved with cinder appears in front of me. This may be Route Magniny, but there is no street sign to confirm my suspicion. On the left side of the road is a vegetable garden, and on the right is a row of bamboo fences with many trees planted inside. At this intersection, another red arrow sign is found, and not far away, you can see a white cloth on the bamboo fence, fluttering in the wind, with the six characters "Huang Garden Famous Chrysanthemum Exhibition" written on it.

Stepping through the bamboo fence gate, you see a long row of chrysanthemums inlaid between two neat and tidy garden plots. Stubble is left on the plots, but it is not easy to find a weed, which shows how carefully the garden is usually managed. Several scarlet red maple trees, dotted among the yellow leaves, are very eye-catching. At this time, an old man with a drooping long beard and a clear face came out to greet us. After exchanging pleasantries, it turned out that he was Mr. Huang Yueyuan, the owner of the Huang Garden. Mr. Huang cordially entertained us and recounted the history of the garden. The Huang Garden was originally in Zhenru. After the incident, it moved to Shanghai. Whenever the chrysanthemums were in full bloom, a chrysanthemum exhibition was held in Zhenru. At that time, visitors did not hesitate to travel a long distance to attend. After moving to Shanghai, all the famous varieties were gradually transported to Shanghai, and famous chrysanthemums were collected from Tianjin and Beijing. The new varieties cultivated in Zhenru were cultivated with great care, and now there are about a thousand varieties. From Mr. Huang's conversation, it can be seen that his experience in horticulture is extremely rich.

So, along the path made of chrysanthemums, after turning several bends and passing through two layers of bamboo fences, you enter another flower world. A large square is full of chrysanthemums of various colors, arranged like a large sea of chrysanthemums. Various bright colors reflect each other, and all kinds of flowers surge into your eyes. At this time, I really don't know where to focus my eyes, and I am stunned for a moment. Finally, I decided to start from my own position.

Two large piles of chrysanthemums are arranged on both sides of the grass house. According to Mr. Huang's instructions, each pile has fifty-four varieties, and each pot has a different variety. You need to carefully appreciate them to distinguish the beauty of the chrysanthemums. Among these two piles, the colors of the chrysanthemums are extremely beautiful: red, yellow, purple, white, and various other indescribable beautiful colors. The petals are shaped like beards, tubes, petals, and hooks, in various forms, each different. If you don't see it with your own eyes, you won't feel the loveliness of the chrysanthemums. Browsing pot by pot, appreciating plant by plant, walking through like a fleeting glance, and when passing particularly favorite colors or petals, you squat down and get closer to appreciate them more deeply, with a feeling of indescribable joy in your heart. If someone asks you which plant of chrysanthemum you like and what makes you like it, I will definitely not be able to answer. So, a kind of beautiful material must be personally experienced. Appreciating chrysanthemums is like this.

About 10,000 chrysanthemums are planted on a large square, a magnificent sight. Cultivating these chrysanthemums on an isolated island is not an easy task, because an isolated island is not a place to grow flowers. It is said that Mr. Huang specially hired nearly ten gardeners to manage irrigation, fertilization, and other tasks. They have been busy for a whole year, just to give us one day of appreciation, so I would never give up this opportunity to appreciate chrysanthemums.

I am completely ignorant of chrysanthemums, but I have always liked them. The names of chrysanthemums are full of poetic and artistic flavor. Fortunately, Mr. Huang and his son, Mr. Delin, were there to point out the names of the chrysanthemums one by one. Unfortunately, I couldn't remember them all for a while, but I remember a few of the most precious ones, such as the beard-like "Spider Web," "Flying Curtain Lightly Hanging," and "Ape Crying in the Wuxia Gorge," and the petal-like "Jade Fat" and "Golden Turtle," and the tube-like "Running Water Flying Waterfall" and "Pinggao Qujiang."

Appreciating in this fleeting way took two or three hours, which shows that this famous chrysanthemum exhibition is truly magnificent. The variety and the number of pots are unprecedented in Shanghai. When I was about to leave, Mr. Huang specially gave me two photos as a souvenir of this visit.

### Young Master of Huamei Pharmacy

— Tragic Murder of His Brother

The Assailant Is Said to Have Been Sent to a Mental Asylum: Police Authorities Are Conducting an Investigation

The case of the young master of Huamei Pharmacy murdering his brother, which has been widely reported in society recently, has received close attention from this newspaper. However, due to the seriousness of the case and conflicting accounts, it has been difficult to obtain accurate information despite inquiries from various sources. To be cautious, we have not immediately disclosed the information. In response to readers' inquiries by telephone, we are now disclosing the information we have obtained. As for the details of the case, we expect that the truth will soon be revealed by the results of the investigation conducted by the police authorities.

The Murder

Xu Xiangxun, the owner of Huamei Pharmacy at 356 Fuzhou Road, is nearly sixty years old and has two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Songyao, assists his father in running the business. The younger son, Daquan, is still studying in middle school. The eldest daughter, Jihua, is a French medical doctor. In addition to running her own Jihua Hospital at 805 Route Cardinal Mercier, she is also the principal of the Sheng Sheng Midwifery School at 16 Rue Pichon. The youngest daughter is also studying in a girls' school. Unexpectedly, a sudden change occurred in the family. On the afternoon of the 21st of last month, while Songyao was chatting with his sister, Daquan broke in from outside, drew a sharp axe, and suddenly hacked Songyao seven times. At that time, he was covered in blood, a bloody mess, and fell to the ground in pain. After his family took him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, he died on the 26th due to the severity of his injuries and excessive blood loss. It is reported that the assailant has been sent to a mental asylum.

Rumored Causes

According to various sources, Daquan is naturally promiscuous and frequents dance halls almost every day. As a result, he spends money excessively and is often short of funds. He repeatedly requested money from the pharmacy, but was refused by Songyao. Daquan held a grudge, and the motive for murder arose from this. Whether this statement is true must be proven by future facts. According to another source, the cause of the case was that Daquan had recently fallen in love with a dancer and wanted to marry her, but was blocked by Songyao. He held a grudge and took this drastic action. It is reported that the police are paying close attention to this case and have retrieved the body for examination.

### Two Doctors Offer Free Medical Consultations

### If the Bureau's Rice Sale Method Is Not Improved, Middlemen Will Prosper While Those Who Eat Rice Starve. Jiangbei Peddlers, Carrying Backpacks, See Public Rice Sales as a Source of Profit, While Genuine Consumers Wait in Vain for Rice to Buy.

Yesterday, the Public Works Bureau's foreign rice, 13,210 bags of it, arrived from Hong Kong on the Taikoo Company's Jinan Wheel. Of these, 10,000 bags were the Public Works Bureau's low-priced, small-grained rice, which docked at the Taikoo Wharf No. 3 on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Yuesheng Wheel also arrived from Hong Kong with 11,628 bags of foreign rice, of which 10,200 bags were also the Public Works Bureau's low-priced foreign rice, which docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The Public Works Bureau's low-priced foreign rice totaled over 20,000 bags, and guest rice also amounted to over 4,000 bags. However, the Public Works Bureau's rice is still rarely seen in rice shops on the market. Some who seek to purchase the Public Works Bureau's rice are often turned away, told that there is no rice, or asked to come back tomorrow. Yet, as soon as the Public Works Bureau's rice sale sign is hung up, it is like a magic charm, immediately attracting hundreds or thousands of men, women, young, old, and strong, crowding and scrambling to buy, like a long snake. How is it that these people's information is so accurate? It is truly strange. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter passed by a rice shop near the Chengdu Road and Shanhai Pass Road section and initially saw no particular activity. However, less than half an hour later, when passing by again, the reporter saw that the area near the rice shop's entrance was also crowded with people. An old woman stood a few dozen steps away, holding a child, who was urging her to go buy rice. The old woman sighed deeply, saying, "How can I possibly squeeze in?" Later, the reporter encountered a gentleman who also said that there were very few places where one could buy the Public Works Bureau's rice for cooking. Those that existed were already monopolized by Jiangbei peddlers, so tightly packed that one could not hope to squeeze in. If one asked for miscellaneous rice at rice shops that did not display the Public Works Bureau's rice sale sign, one was often turned away, told that there was no rice, even when the shop clearly had rice. Then, one would be told to come back tomorrow to buy. If one went back tomorrow, one would again be squeezed out by the peddlers. How could one possibly get ahead? By the time one managed to squeeze in, the rice shop would already say that the Bureau's rice was sold out, and to wait until the next time. Such instances are too numerous to count. Meanwhile, the peddlers would already be carrying their backpacks, striding away towards the iron gates to profit. Genuine residents within the concession who needed to buy rice for their evening meal, on the other hand, could not buy it and often went home in tears. Therefore, if the Public Works Bureau's rice is not sold widely, or if sales continue to be intermittent, it will inevitably result in "middlemen prospering while those who eat rice starve." As for the rice shops, selling rice is selling rice, and the more crowded it is, the better, as it is easier to muddle the waters and make a profit. The quality of the rice doesn't matter. After one sale, they can say that it's sold out. The Public Works Bureau's rice is, after all, better than broken rice. Small patterned rice on the market sells for 170 yuan, while the Public Works Bureau's rice is only 117 yuan, a difference of 53 yuan. How could it not be a good deal? Furthermore, this way of doing things benefits the business of Jiangbei peddlers, who earn more than ten yuan or dozens or hundreds of yuan each day, depending on how many people they have working for them. These people probably have scouts stationed near various rice shops, so that as soon as the Bureau's rice is put on sale, they immediately surround the shop. This, in turn, causes genuine consumers to sigh in despair at the rice shops, retreating in the face of difficulty. In this way, isn't it the case that the Public Works Bureau's efforts to provide rice are not easily passed on to genuine consumers, and the benefits are instead taken by middlemen and a group of Jiangbei peddlers? Even with the current stable situation, things are already like this. If there were to be a genuine crisis in the Pacific, with the doors of rice shops closed, who knows how many people would starve to death? Therefore, the Public Works Bureau must think of a sound method for selling grain. Otherwise, they will resort to the old tactic of responding to the market with a lack of rice and closing their doors. This, however, is a matter of security and prestige, and precautions must be taken in advance.

Our newspaper recently received a letter from Mr. Yan Zhi, requesting the Public Works Bureau to improve the method of selling low-priced rice. He also believes that "it is impossible to verify when the Hong Kong rice is sold out, and ordinary people and those in the lower and middle salary classes are having difficulty finding grain to eat." He respectfully hopes that the Public Works Bureau will take measures to prevent vendors from taking advantage and seeking profit in the public rice sales method. The measures are:

(1) The Public Works Bureau should issue a purchase certificate for low-priced rice with a numbered code. The certificate should list in detail the name, origin, gender, age, address, occupation, and other information, such as the family or business, or organization, and how much rice is needed. The quantity of rice per certificate should be fixed at one picul, five pecks, or two pecks, depending on the size of the household. The number of rice purchase certificates should be sufficient for one year or half a year. The Bureau should charge a fee for the printing paper according to the quantity of rice purchased. The issuing of certificates should be entrusted by the Public Works Bureau to various police stations, to be investigated and registered in stages, in order to ensure universality and prevent various public associations and organizations from handling the matter, so as to avoid the problem of one person registering in multiple places and obtaining multiple certificates. Or, those who need low-priced rice can apply for a certificate from the nearest police station (the simpler the procedure, the better). (2) Registered persons can pay the sales store to purchase rice with this numbered certificate, and at the same time surrender the purchase certificate. The store should register the daily sales by number on the certificate in a separate ledger. The ledger and certificate can be compared. When the rice purchased by the sales store is sold out, the ledger and certificate can be submitted to the Bureau as proof for continued purchases. As for the registration procedure for the sales store, this is a duty that should be fulfilled in exchange for the profits gained.

(3) When the Public Works Bureau needs to investigate the situation of both the buyer and the seller, it will certainly be easier and more accurate than purchasing without a certificate. The above three are only a general outline. How to put them into practice is something that the Bureau is expected to consider.

Amid the rising price of rice, the Public Works Bureau fears that there are those who disregard the overall situation and arbitrarily raise prices, disrupting the market. Therefore, they have specially dispatched detectives to the market to monitor, causing most rice merchants to stand by and watch. Although there were later rumors of small patterned rice selling for 173 yuan or 170 yuan, Saigon No. 2 for 178 yuan, Siamese No. 2 for 174.5 yuan, and broken pointed rice for 142 yuan or 140 yuan, all were conducted in great secrecy. Therefore, the foreign rice market situation suddenly changed yesterday, appearing to be at a standstill. However, judging from the reported prices, they were three to six yuan higher than the previous week. As for glutinous rice, whether domestic or foreign, no trading was done. Due to the difficulty of obtaining supplies, the domestic rice market for thick and thin new and broken japonica rice continued to see South Port early broken rice selling for 200 yuan to 197 yuan, Kunshan new japonica rice for 200 yuan to 197 yuan, and Qingjiao kiln seeds and Fengjing Big Brother rice all selling for 200 yuan to 195.5 yuan. Sijing wild rice, due to its superior quality, was priced uniquely high, breaking through the 200 yuan mark, selling for 204 yuan.

### Flour is Only Traded in the Black Market

Yesterday, the French Concession Bureau restricted illegal transactions of speculative flour, so most of the transactions of the Grain Public Association were suspended. There was no official market for flour in the morning or afternoon. However, people outside the market were confused by rumors and still hoped for the best, so those holding goods were even more reluctant to sell, and those absorbing the goods were even more excited. Kanfan Golden Dragon was offered in the black market for 60 yuan, and small bags of wheat bran also reached as high as 55 or 56 yuan.

### Cash Market Stalls, Black Market Prices Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the black market for spot gold continued, with traders inquiring about prices and trading by phone outside the exchange. Because trading was not allowed in the Lianyi Public Association and there was no central location, the market price at the same time varied greatly. According to various inquiries, around 9:30 AM, the price was between 22,600 and 22,700 yuan. Securities firms slightly reduced their positions, raising the price to 23,000 yuan. Ten taels were offered at a certain money shop, with the highest bid reaching 23,200 yuan, but there was no transaction. A cash shop offered to sell, and at around 11:00 AM, a certain bank was willing to sell at 22,850 yuan. At noon, it fell back to 22,800 yuan. In the afternoon, it first traded at 22,700 yuan, then gradually fell to 22,500 yuan with sellers, a decrease of 100 yuan compared to the 4:00 PM price last Saturday. Transactions were sparse. The official price of standard gold at cash shops was 22,500 yuan, with a discount of about 1,000 yuan for buying back.

The exchange price for gold jewelry at silver shops remained unchanged at Datong Bank and Xintong Bank, listed at 2,250 yuan (with a discount of 150 yuan for buying back). Silver taels were reduced by 2 yuan to 22 yuan. However, it is said that those who exchange gold jewelry at silver shops must add 50 yuan to the listed price to be able to exchange, and silver taels are about 30 yuan per tael.

### Black Market for British and American Exchange Tightens, Then Returns to Level, US Dollar Exchange Reaches 40 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the official rates of both the Central Bank and HSBC remain level. The number of legitimate commercial applications for exchange at HSBC and other smaller counters increased daily. The black market rates for British and American exchange initially tightened and then returned to level. Initially, US dollar notes reached as high as 41 yuan. Importers of non-essential goods were eager to settle accounts and even settled accounts with a certain Chinese merchant speculator for nearly 10,000 US dollars at unprecedented tight prices of 2.75 yuan and 2.625 yuan. Importers also purchased British gold at 1 pound 875, for over a thousand pounds, which was also sold by speculators. Near noon, it was heard that exporters were also hawking US dollars at 2.75 yuan, but there were no takers, and the momentum slightly hardened. In the afternoon, all foreign exchange houses were extremely quiet. Near the 4:00 PM late close, British exchange was at 2 shillings, and American exchange was at 3 yuan, with buyers appearing, the same price as last Saturday.

The foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds each rise by 10 yuan, and British gold notes also rose by 2 yuan. US dollar notes broke through the 40 yuan mark, once rising to 41 yuan, before falling back to 39.5 yuan in the afternoon. Finally, it rose again to 40.5 yuan, an increase of 1.5 yuan compared to last week. In addition, Hong Kong notes, Canadian notes, and Philippine notes also trended upwards. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes rose even more sharply, the former reaching as high as 3.8 yuan and the latter reaching as high as 3.3 yuan.

### Double Horse Factory Yarn Rises to 3,130 Yuan

The yarn market continued to be firm, but the trend initially rose and then softened. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse factory yarn was 3,010 yuan, which gradually rose to 3,130 yuan. At this time, some profit-takers sold, and the market became looser and fell back, gradually dropping to the edge of 3,000 yuan. However, as prices fell, bargain hunters returned, and it closed at 3,030 yuan. Golden Double Horse trading was suspended.

The situation for spot yarn continued to advance, and generally, hoarders were unwilling to unload their goods, resulting in mutual bidding and daily increases. In the afternoon, it was heard that the price of Longtou fine cloth had jumped, and people's hearts were once again drawn upwards. Currently, some say that the price of yarn cloth is firmer than that of Chinese yarn.

### Cotton Prices Only Rise, Never Fall

The spot cotton market situation continues to see prices only rise, never fall. Because various commodity prices are gradually rising, creating an alarming phenomenon, those holding goods are unwilling to sell. Actual sales by factories are not as active as in the past. This is because the base has already entered a high range, but speculative trading by number houses is still somewhat lively, and market prices are still in full swing.

### Hoarding Becomes More Intense, Coarse Cloth Jumps 14 Yuan, Flower Butterfly Double Elephant Opens at 130 Yuan

Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the upward trend in the market became more intense, due to continued absorption by hoarders, enthusiastic sentiment, and mutual price increases. Although there was a temporary pullback, the result was still a push towards new highs. Sixteen-pound Flower Butterfly Double Elephant coarse cloth reached a new high of 130 yuan, a sharp increase of 14 yuan per bolt compared to the previous week. Remaining grades of fine cloth and twill rose by 5 yuan to more than 10 yuan. Colored cloth prices rose chaotically by about 10 yuan. Transactions on this street totaled over 1,000 pieces of various cloths.

Dongbu: The morning opening was mediocre, but soon rose. By the time the market closed at noon, the Longtou fine cloth factory sheet was at 119 yuan. Unexpectedly, the aftermarket opening saw buyers coming one after another, and the price continued to rise. The highest peak was seen at 130 yuan. At the close, retail investors sold, and it fell back to 126.5 yuan, but this was still an increase of 12.5 yuan per bolt compared to the previous week. The price of Four Gentlemen Serge fluctuated rapidly, with the lowest price in the morning at 3.89 yuan and the highest price in the afternoon at 4.26 yuan. The evening close was 4.2 yuan, and the market situation remained extremely firm.

### Sugar Price Increase Even Fiercer, Another 6,000 Bags Arrive

Yesterday, the sugar market's upward trend was extremely fierce. Both morning and afternoon futures were suspended due to excessive price increases. Spot goods, due to hoarding by a certain bank, rose even more sharply, with the highest increase reaching over 50 yuan.

### Cigarettes, Soap, and Candles See Wild Jumps

Yesterday, speculative merchants took advantage of the scarcity of cigarettes, matches, soap, and candles to manipulate and hoard, causing wild jumps in prices. New high prices appeared one after another. In addition, off-market speculators with abundant capital absorbed large quantities, like a flood, with no end in sight. Therefore, the Public Association issued a notice announcing the suspension of trading in the afternoon. Subsequent trading may need to be conducted off-market.

### Domestic Bonds Remain Weak, Foreign Stocks See Excitement

The black market for public bonds was also weak yesterday. C bonds traded at a new low of 64 yuan, but recovered by 1 yuan due to short covering. Sentiment remained weak, and volumes were extremely low. Former bulls were looking for a way to exit, and the market was difficult to rally. In the morning, Yizhong Yuxing Lianyi bought, and Runde Datong Jiufeng Dade sold. The market was still dominated by selling pressure, falling by about 1 yuan. In the afternoon, Runde opened at 64 yuan for C bonds. The small opening triggered short covering, and the price recovered to 5 yuan. Tongfen bought in, but Jiufeng Changji Shengxing Xiexing Yuan Yi Tai Jiucheng all sold. The market hovered around 5 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall by a small 0.45 yuan to 1 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 2.4 million yuan. A summary table is listed below. Category: Highest, Lowest, Closing, Compared to Previous Day

Stock Trading: 300 shares of Wing On Company stock were traded at a price of 68.5 yuan.

Also, the stock market at the Zhongye Public Institute saw extremely large transaction volumes, and prices soared. Yarn factories and mid-priced stocks rose to an alarming extent. Although there was a slight pullback in the afternoon, the underlying trend remained extremely firm.

### Snow Scene in Soviet Russia

— Jian Nong

At a time when the Soviet-German war is extremely tense, snow is actually falling. My memories are forcing me to recall the suffering of Napoleon I's soldiers in the icy and snowy lands of Russia!

According to historical records, Napoleon withdrew from Moscow on October 15, 1812. On October 23, the weather suddenly turned cold, and on November 6, heavy snow fell. French historian Dr. Segur wrote: "Then everything became confused and unrecognizable. Military objects were completely transformed. People advanced but did not know where they were or see their destination. As soldiers tried to discern the direction in this vortex of wind and snow, the swirling snowflakes accumulated and stopped on the surface of most depressions, concealing unfathomable depths and harboring treacherous openings under our feet. In these places, soldiers sank, and the weakest were buried at their fate.

The Moscow winter assaulted our soldiers from all directions: it penetrated their thin clothes and pierced their worn-out boots, and their damp clothes froze on their bodies. Before them and around them was nothing but snow; their gazes were lost in this boundless, sorrowful monochrome, and their imaginations were overwhelmed. It was as if nature used a large shroud to envelop our army. The only things that stood out from this apparent uniformity were some somber pine trees, trees on graves with a mourning color, and their tall, black trunks that stood tall and unmoved..."

French writer Chateaubriand also described it in his book "Memoirs from Beyond the Tomb": "On November 6, the temperature had dropped to eighteen degrees below zero, and everything disappeared into a uniform white. Soldiers without shoes or socks felt their feet dying; their purple and stiff fingers let the guns, which felt like they were burning their hands, slip to the ground; frost flowers stood erect on their hair, and their beards were frozen by the exhaled moisture, and their miserable clothes became a suit of ice armor! They fell to the ground, and the snow buried them, and they formed small mounds of graves on the ground... Pine trees, standing tall like crystal columns, stood here and there: like candlesticks in a funeral ceremony... Some crows and swarms of white dogs followed the retreat of these living corpses not far away..."

Recalling the scene of that day, it was as if benevolent nature itself was tired of seeing the miserable pictures created by the warmongering Napoleon: therefore, it scattered flakes of snow, using this six-petaled wonder to cover up the bloody, skeletal fields, the lands covered with severed arms, broken legs, headless bodies, and sunken chests, and to temporarily restore the original color of the pure universe...

### Progress in Medicine

— Yi Dao

Alas! The snow of Moscow! Fall quickly, fall quickly, quickly cover up those pictures that are a hundred times more cruel and miserable than those of a hundred years ago...?

Amid the rapid and significant progress of various sciences, surgery has also advanced with the times. Its recent new inventions have added much glory to the medical field. Below are some of the most successful new contributions:

Vascular Suture

Since the beginning of surgery, the most difficult task recognized by all physicians has been suturing severed blood vessels. However, last year, Sidney Smith, a third-year student in the Department of Medicine at the University of Chicago, after a long period of careful research, created a new method of suturing blood vessels.

He invented a device similar to an embroidery bamboo pole, the structure of which is very simple. It only requires several sterilized rubber tubes of different sizes to be filled with melted "dextrose." After the dextrose solidifies into a strip, the rubber is removed, and then a layer of collodion is applied to the outside of the dextrose. When used, the two ends of the blood vessel are simply placed on this dextrose strip, and the blood vessel can be easily sutured. Once the suturing is complete and blood flow is restored, the dextrose strip and collodion will automatically dissolve in the blood, not only without harming the human body but also avoiding many troubles and dangers.

Neural Adhesive

The production and metabolism of nerve cells are absolutely different from those of cells in other parts of the human body. Therefore, nerves severed due to external injuries or surgery cannot be sewn together using ordinary surgical methods. Over the years, it has not been possible to devise a perfect method. However, now two zoologists, with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation, founded by the oil tycoon Rockefeller, have invented an adhesive that can connect nerves without any sewing.

The neural adhesive is chick arterial blood that is frozen and then refined into a very viscous liquid. When used, this adhesive is simply applied to the severed pieces of the nerve, and within ten minutes, the fibers at both ends of the nerve can automatically connect, turning into a complete nerve as before. After the nerve is connected, the adhesive will dissolve in the human body.

Heparin Hemolysin

In addition to red and white blood cells, blood also contains many platelets. The characteristic of platelets is that they automatically coagulate when exposed to air. Therefore, if there are no platelets in our blood, even bleeding from capillaries can be fatal.

However, platelets also have a drawback, which is that after surgery, platelets coagulate on the inner walls of blood vessels, cutting off blood flow. In 1916, a physician named Hopkins extracted a type of liver juice from the liver of dogs that could delay platelet coagulation, but ultimately the liver juice was toxic and unsuitable for human use. It was not until recently that physicians Banting and MacLeod, who invented the treatment for diabetes, extracted a non-toxic heparin from bovine lungs. If heparin is dripped into blood vessels during surgery, it can prevent blood flow from being cut off and avoid the risk of blood poisoning. Therefore, the number of deaths due to platelet coagulation, which previously accounted for 65% of the total, has been greatly reduced since the adoption of heparin.

Invention

### Dog Nose Prints

— Yong Yun

Recently, the application of dog nose prints for identifying dogs has begun, because each dog's nose print is also different. Their sizes, shapes, and structures all vary. The skin of a dog's nose has many irregular small dots, and the grooves on them vary in depth, so careful observation can distinguish them. This type of dog nose print certificate is tied to the dog's collar, so it is very useful when a dog is lost or stolen. In addition, in the event of disputes in accidents, the dog's owner cannot deny or quibble.

### Random Notes on Iceland

— Bo Hua

The capital of Iceland is Reykjavik. The total population of Iceland is 118,000, and the city has a population of 28,000.

Iceland's parliament was first established in 930 AD.

When Germany occupied Denmark, the Icelandic authorities decided to manage their own affairs because Denmark was originally a sister country of Iceland.

Iceland has hot springs everywhere, which may be unexpected.

All of Iceland has 107 volcanoes, and about 13 percent of the country is covered by glaciers. There are about 2,000 cars in Iceland, but no railways.

Fisheries are the lifeline of Iceland and are most important, although the total number of farmers is 50,000, while the number of fishermen is only 18,000. Hay is the main crop on farms.

Fourteen Dozen Hero's Life

"But..." What Xiao Jiqing wanted to say was exactly what Qian Ruomo was thinking. "But Boss Wu is already over forty years old. Can his body support daily heavy falls and fights?"

While Xiao Jiqing was speaking, Qiu Haitang was silently calculating in his heart.

"Yes! How can he not if he wants to eat?" He couldn't help but smile bitterly. "Right now I live in a small inn, and the rent is ten yuan a month, plus two meals, a total of forty yuan. That's how I can manage!"

"Okay, then I'll have them find you an assistant!" Although Xiao Jiqing was not even thirty years old yet, he still had some impressions of Qiu Haitang's glory when he was at his peak. Now, seeing him so destitute, he couldn't help but feel a little sympathy. "Just wait another month or two, and I'll make sure to instruct that Manager Wen to find a position for you as an understudy lead old male role, or a martial second female role. One way or another, I have to make the quota a hundred full, so I can be worthy of you."

"Easy to say, easy to say! Just like this, I can't repay your kindness!" Qiu Haitang specially bowed deeply to him. (253)

### Miscellaneous Talks on the Locked Lin Pouch (Part 2)

— Hua Yu

Although Yanqiu has gained weight over the years, his stage makeup can truly make him look twenty years younger. With rouge and powder, he is particularly charming and beautiful. Although his figure doesn't show curves due to the weight gain, he still has an elegant bearing. His water sleeves are spirited, his acting is profound, and his movements are rarely quick or flashy, but when he does make a few movements, they are extremely brilliant and lively, and they greatly enhance the plot. He plays the role of a high-class lady perfectly, embodying her status. Before appearing on stage, his long monologue behind the curtain, with its varying inflections and intonations, and its deliberate pauses and releases, is quite forceful. His delicate demeanor and expressions after entering the stage are perfectly measured, neither unrestrained nor perfunctory. In the "Siping Diao Xipi Yuanban" passage, the subtlety lies in the fact that all the analyses fall into the void, the structure is excellent. The "Yaoban" and "Sanban" sections are sometimes detailed, sometimes free, but the [程]腔 (Cheng style melody) is still deeply moving. Many people say that his singing style is known for its delicateness, but in fact, the Cheng style is skillful without being small, smooth without being soft, charming without being vulgar, clear without being bland, and rich without being muddy. Although the melodies have many twists and turns, not a single word is neglected, and every tune has its origin. In this play, there are many instances of stealing from the old male role's melodies. In the second-class segment, the words "chun" (spring) and "po" (broken) are articulated extremely accurately. One would imagine that the "Que" (magpie) character in the phrase "newlyweds crossing the Magpie Bridge" is sung in a fragmented but coherent way, broken but not separated, with extremely strict and crisp breath control. Afterwards, the allegro becomes tighter and louder as he sings, which is beyond the reach of ordinary people. The transitions are extremely hard but not abrupt, the pauses are urgent but not hasty. The segment "Hearing the tragic voice, my heart is like a burden" is like "clouds covering the slanting sun," until the section "Stop yelling, and stand still," the "Mingban" and "Qiangban" are seamless. Afterwards, it is like a sudden storm, unrestrained and affectionate, like pearls rolling on a plate, seemingly fast but actually stable, seemingly hard but actually harmonious. The four lines, "I am lacking while he is in need, he is hungry and cold while I am spoiled, I will give him a branch of coral treasure, to secure his Phoenix Nest for half a lifetime," are like rain dripping from the eaves onto the windows, pattering and dancing, its state ever-changing, like reading Ouyang Xiu's "Autumn Sounds Fu." When the allegro ends, it is purely driven by breath control, which is most touching. Below is the return to worship the flower hall, the flood escape, and the second half of the play. First, Granny Hu opens the scene, shouting "It's bitter!" from behind the curtain, without any affectation. Her dialogue with Granny Hu is filled with deep understanding of the situation of a wealthy man finding it difficult to encounter laughter, somewhat like Emperor Hui of Jin's saying, "Why don't hungry people eat meat porridge?" As for her body language and expressions, they are all extremely beautiful and vivid. Her facial expressions and eyes all reveal the inner understanding from a generous manner. Hearing that she has to go begging, her expression, wanting to go forward but not daring to, almost makes you feel like you are in a soup kitchen rather than in a theater. Every detail is perfect. Seeing Madam Lu willingly act as a nanny and seeing the little master, her demeanor, and her attitude of not wanting to lower herself to be a maid, and the expressions of recalling the past, all flow out inadvertently and without being contrived, and are definitely not acting-like performances. Wu Fuqin and Furongcao sang two lines of "Yaoban," also using the Cheng style, and sang it quite well, only the breath was weaker, the water sounds were too few.

### A Record of Famous Amateur Performers' Joint Performance

— Zhen Chang

The other night, for Mr. Cao's birthday celebration, there was a performance at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. Those who went on stage with painted faces were all famous amateur performers in Shanghai. By the time I arrived, the Candle Shadow Count had already reached its tail end. Mr. Jiang Yinting and Mr. Ji Jixi's "Wujia Po" took the stage amidst thunderous applause. Mr. Jiang's Xue Pinggui had a rich and beautiful appearance, experienced stage presence, and had skill in both singing and acting. Mr. Ji's voice was sweet and smooth, his singing and acting were excellent, and his appearance was also extremely elegant. It is said that both gentlemen are the backbone of the Shen Society. The play was arranged by their friend Mr. Fan Shiren, and they also invited the old master Ruidebao to personally rehearse the body movements. Therefore, although it was their first time on stage, they were able to write the Huang Ting Jing perfectly, just right, not unworthy of the teachings of a famous teacher. The one playing the stringed instrument was the famous amateur Qin player Mr. Wang Ruoyi, adding flowers to the brocade, which added a lot of color to the play. It was decided that Mr. Tian Bozhi would play the role of "Catching Cao," Mr. Chen Wenhuan would play the role of Lü Boshe, and the famous teacher Ma Shigang would play the role of Cao Cao, also performing flawlessly. Next was Ms. Lu Zhiming's "Three Hall Joint Trial," with a beautiful appearance, singing in the style of the Mei School, and with the addition of Mr. Wang Ruoyi's erhu, it further enhanced the Mei style, earning praise from the audience. It is said that Ms. Lu works at the Guohua Bank. Mr. Xiao Shui and Mr. Shen Bainian's "Meilong Zhen" followed, both gentlemen are experienced craftsmen, and the excellence of their singing and acting goes without saying. The finale was Mr. Cheng Yize, chairman of the Yuyou Sports Association, and Mr. Chen Xiangquan's complete "Zhen Chanzhou." This play is a heavy-duty opera for male leads with beards and young male leads, and it is rare to see amateur performers performing it so flawlessly. Mr. Cheng's Yue Fei had an experienced foundation, beautiful spear flourishes, and his singing was also very charming. Chen Xiangquan's Yang Zaixing, judging by the leg work, one could tell that he had put in a lot of hard work. This play was also taught by the old master Ruidebao, so it was naturally extraordinary. The grand finale was Mr. Liu Tianhong, a famous amateur performer, who played "Zhulian Village," but it was a pity that I couldn't see the whole picture because it was too late.

Chapter 18: Trying to Sweep the Xiongnu Without Regard for One's Own Life

"Now it seems that General Wu is mediocre and no different from ordinary people, and he even wants to imitate the begging of Jin Bao Xu, but he doesn't know that the situation is different. One day, when we see the barbarian slaves entering the customs, trampling on the Central Plains, our Great Ming people will have to suffer a great catastrophe. Then aren't we casting pearls before swine, greatly disappointed?" Zhang Cangqiu said, "Okay, since our four brothers have the same views, now there is no need for empty talk, which is of no help to reality. Let's go see General Wu and advise him to quickly decline the Qing soldiers, and rely on his own strength to eliminate the roving bandits. "Liu Yinying said, "General Wu has already decided to do this. The Qing army has already set out. If we ask him to withdraw his order, how can he agree?" Zhang Cangqiu said, "Whether he can agree or not, I don't care about that. If there is a bone stuck in my throat, I have to spit it out. We might as well go and try." So the four of them discussed and decided to go to the pass together to see San Gui. San Gui heard that Zhang Cangqiu and others were requesting an audience. He was somewhat dissatisfied with Zhang Cangqiu, because they refused to accept his dispatch to go to Beijing to save Yuan Yuan, but thinking that they were all capable warriors, and he was in need of talent, he had to give them some face, and in the future he would have to use their strength to fight the roving bandits, so he received them. When Zhang Cangqiu saw San Gui, he first opened his mouth and said, "This general has just opened up the Pacifying the West Earl" and pledged to crusade against the bandits, admiring his loyalty and righteousness, so I am willing to serve and jointly punish the rebels. Now that the Pacifying the West Earl has retreated to Shanhaiguan, watching and not moving forward, instead allowing the roving bandits to commit crimes, and the Pacifying the West Earl has not yet supervised the three armies to give them a head-on blow, but instead went to the Qing court to ask for help, this general is really a little confused.
