### Hua Ru Obtains U.S. Military Aid; A Major Counteroffensive Will Be Launched This Autumn; Japan Faces a Military Deadlock in China, Unable to Advance or Retreat; Its Southern Advance Is Highly Risky and Dares Not Be Attempted Lightly

Chongqing: According to well-informed Chinese sources here, Japan has not yet decided whether to advance southward or deeply into the Chinese interior. The Chinese army, however, expects to receive sufficient American weaponry this autumn and will then launch an offensive. Barring unforeseen developments and with the rapid and large-scale influx of American aid, China is unwilling to remain on the defensive for long. China only needs aircraft, artillery, and mechanical equipment to launch a large-scale counteroffensive against the Japanese army in China. All indications suggest that this equipment will soon be continuously supplied by the United States. After the arrival of the weaponry, some time will be needed for training and organization before its effectiveness can be displayed on the battlefield. A portion of this weaponry will also be used to protect China's vital communication lines and major base areas. With the continuous inflow of overseas war materiel, when this work is completed, the world will witness a significant change in Sino-Japanese relations. Where the Chinese army will begin its counteroffensive is a secret of the Chinese military headquarters, unknown to outsiders. However, it can be predicted that the Chinese army will certainly launch a fierce offensive at a location that will bring China the greatest economic, military, and political value. At the same time, this offensive will be of a nature that will make the deepest impression abroad. Barring unforeseen developments, the Chinese army is expected to launch its offensive this autumn, around September. As for Japan, it is currently in a dilemma, unable to advance or retreat. To advance southward would risk a major war with Britain and the United States. To attack Chongqing would lead to a deeper and deeper quagmire. It hesitates and cannot make a decision. Recently, there has been much talk of Japan's imminent southward advance, with the following reasons given: (1) Since Japan's policy is based on the idea of Axis victory, Japan will inevitably seize the various countries in the South Seas that possess dangerous terrain and abundant resources before the end of the European war, lest Japan has no reason to enjoy them and lets Germany choose the best and take them. (2) Britain and the United States are currently preoccupied with Europe, making this the best time for Japan to seize the South Seas. (3) Given the progress of the international situation, the most likely contender with Japan for dominance in the Pacific is the Dutch East Indies, as its forward base. If Japan can attack Singapore and the Dutch East Indies in a blitzkrieg and occupy them before the completion of Anglo-American joint defense, then Japan can eliminate once and for all the future crisis of a power contending with Japan in the Pacific. (4) With the war against China having reached a stalemate, there is a strong demand within Japan for active southward expansion. To cope with this demand and to divert popular resentment arising from the failure of its China policy, the Japanese government may decide on a major operation in the South Pacific. (5) Many Japanese believe that a southward advance is an effective way to resolve the war against China, as it would completely cut off the sea lanes for British and American aid to China. At the same time, there are also reasons why Japan dares not advance southward. If Japan takes such an unwise risk, it will inevitably lead to a major war with Britain and the United States, and it cannot expect active assistance from Germany. If it loses the war, Japan will not only have to withdraw completely from China but will also face disaster in Japan proper. If the war is prolonged, its military position in China will also become weaker and weaker, and Japan has no assurance of Germany's final victory in the European war. While Japan hesitates and is unwilling to make a major southward advance, there is no shortage of voices within Japan urging it to devote all its efforts to attacking Chongqing. To do this, Japan would have to concentrate all its manpower to fight a long, extremely difficult battle in the inaccessible interior of China. Even if it manages to capture Chongqing, the war would not be over, because the Chinese army could still move west, northwest, or southwest and continue fighting. Japan would not be able to end the war in one or two years. If a major change occurs in the international situation at that time, Japan will find that its strength is exhausted and it is unprepared to confront other major powers. Amidst this wavering, Japan has launched a peace offensive in Britain and the United States, hoping to induce them to compromise with Japan on Pacific issues, so as to obtain the most favorable terms without risking a major war. Washington has viewed this movement with indifference, much to Japan's disappointment. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### Japanese Newspaper Reports Intensified Sino-British-American Military Cooperation

Tokyo: The "Nichinichi Shimbun" today prominently published a report from Shanghai stating that China, Britain, and the United States have intensified military cooperation to strengthen their defenses in the South. They have determined that the recent American preparations to participate in the European war will inevitably cause Japan to take military action. Regarding this matter, the three countries are now vigorously constructing an "air defense system" to counter Japan. This system will be revealed when war breaks out. The "Nichinichi Shimbun's" special dispatch from Shanghai also stated that China, Britain, and the United States, with British Far East Commander-in-Chief Brooke-Popham as the supreme commander, are jointly establishing an anti-Japanese air defense line, with Singapore and Manila as the main bases, to defend the Malay Peninsula, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and southwestern China. Regarding this, the three countries have already begun constructing a huge air base, with Singapore as its center. The British have also installed 18-inch long-range artillery and anti-aircraft guns at key positions on the Malay Peninsula. Eighty British, American, and Australian warships, including submarines and aircraft carriers, have intensified their defenses in the South Seas. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" also claimed that the United States is assisting China with aircraft, airmen, mechanical technicians, and gasoline to quickly rebuild its air force bases, which have been destroyed by the Japanese navy and air force over the past three years. The United States recently decided to supply China with 500 to 800 aircraft, including Flying Fortresses. It is reported that as of May 11th, 35 American technicians and more than ten airmen had arrived in Chongqing via Hong Kong and are currently supervising the construction of aircraft and training Chinese pilots at various designated locations.

Editorial

### The Tragedy of Vichy

Last December 13th, the Vichy government, disagreeing with Laval's plan for Franco-German collaboration, dismissed him from his position as vice-premier and replaced him with Darlan. At the time, commentators generally praised Pétain's decisive action and saw that move as a glimmer of hope for Vichy's future. However, the various facts of the past half-year have proven that although Laval personally left office, his political line continues in Vichy and has been completed by Darlan. In every way, Darlan is precisely a successor to Laval.

The content of the agreement reached between Darlan and the Germans remains a mystery. Although Vichy's ambassador to the United States, Henry-Haye, assured the U.S. last month that France would never hand over its navy or colonies to Germany or any other country, it is an undeniable fact that the Germans have already obtained various military advantages in Syria, at least to some extent. Darlan's lengthy speech to reporters in Paris on May 30th, in which he severely condemned Britain and declared Vichy's determination to participate in the "new order" in Europe, sufficiently proves that at a time when the Germans are urgently seeking to increase their strength to defeat Britain, the aid they demand from Vichy is unlikely to be withheld. After Weygand returned to France from North Africa, Vichy held two public cabinet meetings in one day on the 3rd. Their importance is said to be comparable to the meetings a year earlier to request an armistice with Germany, and it is rumored that they have decided to resist Britain in Syria and Tunis. A German spokesman also claimed that if France uses force to resist Britain's advance in Syria, it will receive Germany's full cooperation and support. This clearly means that Vichy France is again on the brink of a new war, facing its former ally under the "cooperation" of its historical enemy. If this war were to become a reality, it would truly be a tragic and painful spectacle!

At present, Vichy seems to have become a vassal of the Nazi "new order," but its actions are enough to influence the future international situation. The center of gravity in the Near East is not in Turkey, Egypt, or even Cyprus, but in Syria. If the German army gains a strong foothold in Syria, it will be in a better position to attack Suez, Turkey will be surrounded, and British defense of Cyprus will become extremely difficult. The situation in Dakar has also been closely watched by the United States and is seen as a factor that could drag the Americas into the whirlpool of war. At this point, not only are British warnings insufficient to influence Vichy's determination to cooperate with Germany, but even American appeasement has lost its effectiveness. Even if the aforementioned assurances made by Henry-Haye are indeed reliable, there are still many ways to "cooperate" with the Nazis in political and military terms, apart from formally handing over the navy and colonies to Germany, and some have already become facts. This situation can only be salvaged by resorting to force, and there is no other way. The British measures in Oran and Dakar last year may have been too hasty, but now is indeed the time for decisive action. The British withdrawal from the Balkans and Crete cannot be considered a major failure in overall strategy, but it has at least damaged British prestige and influenced the attitude of some neutral countries. That kind of Dunkirk-style retreat must not be repeated, and in this case in Syria, it is even more necessary to seize the initiative.

Although Vichy is occupied by elements who are generally anti-British and anti-democracy, it certainly does not represent the interests and demands of the vast majority of the French people. The tradition of "liberty, equality, fraternity," which has lasted for 170 years, does not seem to be replaced overnight by "work, family, and loyalty"! The Pétain regime did once gain the support of the French people, but what they sought was a "glorious peace," not the humiliation of an armistice; it was a painful recovery, not a long-term disguised enslavement under the bayonets of their historical enemy to build a so-called "new order," and certainly not to turn their weapons against Britain again after reluctantly laying them down. If the French people still have a strong will and spirit to fight, they must be comrades of de Gaulle, not disciples of Darlan. Although Syria is only a mandated territory and not worth defending by force, it must be purely for France, not for the Nazis. The various harsh demands of the armistice agreement can only be accepted passively. Even after Darlan's recent active negotiations, France has only been able to secure the release of 100,000 French prisoners and the opening of traffic between the occupied and free zones, but for Syria, which Germany demands militarily, it is willing to engage in war again. If this war is not led by the German army, it is believed that it will be difficult to achieve success. This will undoubtedly be more beneficial to Britain and the de Gaulle faction. Vichy's complete reliance on a very slim chance of Nazi victory has doomed it to a tragedy that was already inevitable when it chose surrender and peace, and it will only become more apparent and ultimately impossible to salvage.

### Dutch Foreign Minister Confers with the U.S. on the Defense of the Dutch East Indies; Japan's Demands for Oil Supply Are Excessive; Negotiations Are Making No Progress, and the Situation Is Extremely Tense

Washington: President Roosevelt's meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens yesterday has sparked speculation in the capital that close defense and concrete plans between the United States and the Netherlands in the South Pacific territories may be discussed soon. It is believed that Kleffens brought important information regarding the defense of that area after his inspection of the Dutch East Indies. The "New York Herald Tribune" commented yesterday on news that a dramatic change will occur in the negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies within these days, stating, "Any threat to the Dutch government's freedom of action cannot be ignored by the United States. This is already evident from the United States' provision of spiritual and material assistance to China." The newspaper said that Hull's guarantee to abolish special privileges in China after the restoration of peace implies that the United States intends Japan to be defeated in the war against China. The newspaper continued, "Effective assistance to China depends on transportation. The Dutch East Indies is conveniently located between us and Singapore, Rangoon, and the middle of China. If Japan relegates the Dutch East Indies to a subservient position like Vietnam or Siam, it will be a major blow to China and Britain. The Dutch East Indies should be assured that this will not happen." (United Press dispatch, 5th)

Batavia: The Japanese economic delegation hopes the Dutch will give a response within 24 hours, but the Dutch have reiterated that their views have not changed. As a result, the situation here is even more tense today. The Japanese have expressed dissatisfaction with what the Dutch are willing to give Japan and said that the matter may need to be transferred to the governments concerned, thereby eliminating the economic aspect of the issue. The Dutch fear that Japan will use its own resources obtained in the Dutch East Indies and supply Germany with extra rubber and tin obtained from Thailand and Vietnam. A Dutch spokesman said, "We are not sure that they will do so, but we cannot allow any goods to fall into enemy hands." It is believed that if the Dutch still refuse to agree to Japan's demands, the Japanese representatives will immediately reject the Dutch response. (United Press dispatch, 4th)

Washington: Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens said yesterday that in his view, there is no conflict of interest between Japan and the United States seeking war materials from the Dutch East Indies. "Japan can obtain the materials we can extract within a reasonable range, because we are very reasonable. But we do not want any other country to occupy a dominant position within our territory. The current oil agreement with Japan is proceeding smoothly, and it was extended for another six months a few days ago. I do not believe that the Japanese are very satisfied, because it is really difficult to satisfy them." Kleffens met with President Roosevelt yesterday and, according to him, discussed many issues. However, the Dutch East Indies has not yet received any American goods under the Lend-Lease Act. This trip by Kleffens is a return trip from the Dutch East Indies, Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines. It is said that the defense and morale of the Dutch East Indies are excellent. (United Press dispatch, 5th)

Batavia: Mr. Littman, head of the Information Bureau of the Dutch East Indies government, who recently visited Australia, gave a speech here yesterday on the relationship between Australia and the Netherlands, saying that there is a need for joint assistance. Both sides are trading countries, and it is not surprising to consider differences in the economic and social nature of the environment. Australia is now gradually aware of the development and importance of the Netherlands, and the interest of Australians in the visit of Dutch officials to Australia is a clear demonstration of Australia's attention to the Dutch East Indies. Relations between the two sides still need to be improved, and mutual understanding needs to be increased. Therefore, a plan to exchange information between the two sides is currently being prepared. He hopes that this move can promote a permanent relationship. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Washington: After meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens yesterday, President Roosevelt also conferred with Supreme Court Justice Murphy. White House Secretary Early said that he asked the President whether he would ask Murphy to serve as the Governor-General of the Philippines. The President replied that he knew nothing about it. Well-informed sources speculate that the President is probably seeking Murphy's opinion on the issue of replacing the current Governor-General of the Philippines, Sayre, with a successor. (United Press dispatch, 5th)

Batavia: Perske, Far East correspondent for the Australian Associated Press, yesterday elaborated on the need for closer cooperation between Australia and the Dutch East Indies from an Australian perspective. After recounting the historical ties between the two countries, Perske said that Australians did not have a better understanding of the Dutch East Indies until last year, and were amazed at its war efforts. British Far East Commander-in-Chief Brooke-Popham recently stated that the defense line of the democratic countries in the southwestern Pacific extends from Singapore to Australia. Shortly after, the Dutch Foreign Minister also declared that the defense line starts from Burma, passes through Malaysia, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, and reaches New Zealand. In his opinion, there are many things that Australia and the Dutch East Indies can mutually benefit from on the basis of cooperation. In short, what Australia can give to the Dutch East Indies is as follows: (1) Military assistance on land, sea, and air; (2) Heavy industrial products such as steel; (3) Several bases on the west coast of Australia for the Dutch navy and air force to expand patrols; (4) Extremely refined products; (5) Precision products currently lacking in the Dutch East Indies; (6) Food; (7) Armaments, including aircraft engines. The Dutch East Indies can supply Australia with the following: (1) A defense line of islands parallel to the Equator from Darwin to Singapore and another defense line passing through the Equator to Dutch New Guinea; (2) Continued use of islands between Darwin and Singapore that are necessary to maintain Imperial communications; (3) Strong economic assistance; (4) Substantial assistance from the merchant fleet; (5) Supply of high-grade aviation fuel and low-grade petroleum; (6) Fifty important air bases available for British military use; (7) A market for multiple products. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### Reported Return of Winant to the Country Carrying Important News; Hull Refuses to Disclose the Content of the Report and Denies the British Prime Minister's Request for a Declaration of War

Washington - Yesterday, Secretary of State Hull gave the first official hint that Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant's arrival carries serious news regarding the overall situation of the British war effort. Hull refused to discuss the facts reported by Winant to the White House and the State Department, stating only that Ambassador Winant reported on the overall situation of diplomatic policy, as well as the related international naval and military situations, and the dangers faced by the United States, for a total of more than thirty minutes. When asked if Winant had carried a request from British Prime Minister Churchill asking the United States to declare war, Hull replied that Ambassador Winant had not made such a request. Winant was originally scheduled to go to the White House yesterday to confer with the President, but later went to New York on official business. (5th, Taiwan Public News Agency)

Washington - In Washington today, there is a desire to find an explanation for the return of the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Winant, to the United States. Therefore, unofficial circles in both Washington and London have criticized the recently widespread rumors of peace negotiations. Winant is now believed to be carrying an urgent appeal from Britain for help. Consequently, Washington experts are studying what the consequences would be if the United States could not increase its aid to Britain. Winant's most pressing task at present is to hold talks with officials of the Lend-Lease program. Therefore, the rumors that he is carrying news of peace negotiations or an offer related to Nazi leader Hess, who recently fled to Britain, are not widely believed. Winant will return to the White House today to continue reporting to President Roosevelt. Winant declared that he would stay here for several days to hold talks with President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of the Army Stimson, and Vice President Wallace. It has been sufficiently proven that Winant's return to the United States was voluntary and not in response to the President's call. The White House is now closely watching the Axis powers' attacks on Alexandria and the extension of the war to Asia Minor. The White House is also closely watching whether Britain might collapse. If Britain collapses, the British fleet will no longer be able to exist between the Western Hemisphere and Europe. It was learned yesterday that Winant had fully reported to President Roosevelt and the State Department on the course of Britain's war against Germany. (5th, Associated Press)

Washington - Simms, the international editor of the U.S. Howard system newspaper, published a paper stating that U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant has reported to President Roosevelt, stating that it would be difficult for Britain to resist Germany independently until 1942. Although the details of the report are unknown, it is generally believed that Winant carried a "letter of appeal" from Churchill to Roosevelt, and others believe that Churchill has demanded that the United States immediately intervene in maritime affairs. Neutral observers believe that if the United States does not immediately provide assistance, Britain will enter into peace negotiations. (5th, Haitian News Agency)

Washington - U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant recently returned to the country to report on his duties. It is said that he carried a detailed report on Britain's war experience, including not only military affairs, but also the current British economic and food situation and social background. It is said that the Congress will transfer the supplies received during the war to the U.S. government, which will be of great military value for the preparation of national defense and the protection of democracy. (5th, Reuters)

### The United States Reiterates Its Non-Recognition of the Principle of Territorial Acquisition by Force; Undersecretary of State Welles Submits a Note to Southern Envoys Expressing This View

Washington - The United States formally reiterated yesterday its determination to not recognize what Germany has gained by military conquest. Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday submitted a note to the Yugoslav Minister Futijic in response to two notes from the minister, stating that the U.S. government and people are extremely angry about the invasion and dismemberment of Yugoslavia. It will never recognize the transfer of the national land and sovereignty, the same as not recognizing the land transfer of other countries. The U.S. government will continue to recognize Peter II as the legitimate monarch of Yugoslavia. It is found that the note of the South Minister is protesting Italy's unauthorized establishment of the new country of Croatia. (5th, Associated Press)

### Japan Plans to Send Yokota to Thailand to Discuss Transportation Matters

Tokyo - The Japanese Ministry of Communications has decided to send Yokota, a minister of the province, to Bangkok in mid-June to improve postal and telecommunications, aviation navigation and other transportation matters between Japan and Thailand. (5th, Taiwan Public News Agency)

### US Ambassador Visits Pétain to Urge Announcement of French Policy; Vichy Officially Denies Saying Six Bases Provided for German Use

Vichy - Head of State Pétain met today with U.S. Ambassador to France Admiral Leahy for a lengthy conversation to discuss the international situation. Cabinet Assistant Darlan was also present. (4th, Havas News Agency)

London - U.S. Ambassador to France Leahy visited Vichy Head of State Pétain yesterday, reportedly asking him to announce French policy. The Vichy government has issued an order for extremely strict scrutiny of news reports and information from Vichy related to French-German cooperation. When Pétain spoke yesterday about the new order he intends to implement in France, he did not mention Germany, Syria, or Tunisia. (5th, Reuters)

Washington - U.S. public opinion remains opposed to Vichy Vice Premier Darlan's pro-German policies. Therefore, any steps taken by Britain in Syria will certainly receive unanimous support from the United States. A Washington Post editorial used strong language, saying that if Darlan's words mean anything, France is not only willing to kiss the stick that strikes it, but will also use the stick to turn around and strike the country that could liberate it from its bonds. Hitler is an enemy that the United States has already declared. Since France wants to be Germany's friend, it can no longer be America's friend. (5th, Reuters)

London - Yesterday, London was rife with rumors of further cooperation plans between Vichy and Germany. Although officials have not yet confirmed it, it is of great concern because it shows the potential nature of French assistance. One theory is that according to the conditions set by Hitler and Darlan, six French naval bases will be jointly used by the French and German fleets. These six locations are: Port Said (French Mediterranean coast), Beirut (Syria), Villefranche (near Nice), Algiers, Casablanca, and Dakar. If this theory is true, it is extremely important. If Germany obtains Dakar, it can station ships at this base, which is extremely close to the distance between Africa and the South American continent, and will threaten British ships sailing from various ports in West Africa. However, the Vichy official news agency announced that the responsible party formally denied this theory. (5th, Reuters)

Washington - Last night, it was learned from reliable sources that U.S. Ambassador to France Leahy asked General Pétain to clarify the true purpose and scope of French-German cooperation. It is said that Pétain's reply may greatly affect the diplomatic relations between the United States and France. If French-German cooperation expands, the United States may sever diplomatic relations with the Vichy government. (5th, Haitian News Agency)

### Germans Pouring into Syria; Egypt Bans Trade with the Country

London - A Reuters correspondent reports from the Syrian border that Germans continue to pour into Syria from the sea, land, and air. Three express trains arrive in Syria every week, and fifty Germans disembark from each train. These people carry fake passports from various Balkan countries, disguised as Jewish refugees, carrying cheap suitcases with large characters written on them. Ships requisitioned by Germany arrive at Syrian ports at night, although not confirmed, it is believed that most of these ships arrive at the port of Latakia. Germans flying to various airfields in Syria are also arriving in an endless stream. According to recent news, more than twelve aircraft arrive in Syria every day, mostly fighter planes. On Tuesday, one hundred and fifty transport planes landed in Rayak, the purpose of which is unknown. It was also previously reported that a hospital ship arrived in Beirut recently, and 400 wounded soldiers disembarked. Although this theory has not been confirmed, it is believed that the so-called wounded soldiers are actually Nazi tank soldiers who have taken over French armored vehicles and tanks that have been idle for many months. At the same time, Vichy ordered that any French officers in Syria who escape to Palestine should be killed on the spot. It is said that on Tuesday, two officers who tried to escape were indeed killed. In addition, Vichy warned soldiers that if they tried to flee, their families would be punished and their property confiscated. According to someone who arrived in Palestine, most of the Senegalese troops stationed on the border are inclined to the British side. Therefore, for every hundred soldiers in this army, there are ten Vichy officers supervising and commanding them. These officers have received instructions that if British troops cross the border into Syria, they must open fire. After the Germans arrive in Syria, most of them immediately go to the interior. However, major hotels in Beirut are now reserved for German guests. These people can speak fluent French, but when filling out the hotel registration book, they reveal their nationality. Syrian French people secretly express their disgust at the entry of Germans, and the British suppression of the Iraqi rebellion, the British air force's attacks on Syrian airfields, and the escape of Colonel Grelco have all encouraged the Syrian French. The border area is now quite peaceful, and there are no signs of secret operations being carried out in Syria. The harvest has ripened, and Jews and Arabs are living peacefully and are busy harvesting. (5th, Reuters)

Berlin - The British rumored that many people resembling Aryans and with suspicious behavior have arrived in Syria, claiming to be Romanian Jews, etc. A German Foreign Ministry spokesman denied this news, saying that it was a habitual trick of the British to spread rumors. The French official in charge of Syrian affairs, Dengzi, has officially announced that the absence of German troops in Syria is clear evidence. (5th, Haitian News Agency)

Cairo - The Egyptian Ministry of Finance has classified Syria as a "German-Italian occupied territory" and banned trade with it. (5th, Reuters)

Beirut - British Blenheim bombers bombed the city of Beirut yesterday, dropping bombs for three consecutive hours. Anti-aircraft guns were fired here, with very little damage. (5th, Haitian News Agency)

### British Naval, Land, and Air Forces Concentrating; the Stage of War Is About to Arrive

London - According to news here today, Syria is now virtually surrounded by British forces. British troops, aircraft, and warships are preparing to take action, intending to launch an attack on this French mandate territory once it becomes a base for German operations. British Imperial forces in Mosul, Iraq, Urdun, and Palestine have all concentrated on the Syrian border, and large squadrons of warships are also anchored off the coast of Syria. As a result, Syria, except for the part bordering Turkey, is now completely surrounded by the Central Powers. Because British forces are ready to stand by for orders, it is generally felt here that this move by the British will not be delayed for long. This belief has now been announced by The Times, which said, "If the British wait until the German troops are properly deployed in the French colony before taking action, it may be too late." It also said, "Although the news of German troops landing in Syria has not yet been confirmed, in fact, this kind of German action may be launched in the next few days or hours. British troops in Egypt and Palestine are ready to take any useful steps to stop or prevent it." The Daily Express said that the arrival of General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French forces, at the port of Haifa in Palestine, "may indicate a decisive stage of the war is about to arrive. We must seize this important opportunity." Now that British forces have occupied Mosul, the troops of General Wavell, the commander-in-chief of British forces in the Middle East, have gained side protection and can engage in counteraction. The crisis point in Syria has clearly arrived. At present, the British are waiting to see how the Germans will act before sending troops into Syria. Judging from the Germans' actions, if they do not launch an invasion by transporting troops by plane from Crete, Rhodes, and the Dodecanese Islands, they will attack via Turkey. As for the latter, the British believe that Turkey will never grant the Germans' request to allow their troops to cross the border. In the area bordering Syria and Palestine, although Lieutenant General Wilson can launch a major offensive as soon as he receives orders, the forward troops of the British and French armies are still very friendly and respect each other with cigarettes. On the surface, the British forces are currently guarding against Arab smuggling, while the French are dealing with rebels. In this border area, there are sparsely populated areas, some of which are several miles wide and pass through the mountains. On the Syrian side, there are many fortifications. At night, the French army's searchlights frequently shine on this desolate area. People here speculate that General Wavell may also attempt to invade Syria by transporting troops by plane, considering the possibility that German troops may invade Syria by transporting troops by plane and in view of the fact that British troops used this method to occupy Mosul. Military sources here pointed out that the British army's use of airplanes to occupy Mosul was the second time. The first time the British army used this tactic was to invade southern Italy with paratroopers. The British army used Bristol Bombay transport planes to carry troops. This aircraft is a twin-engine monoplane that can carry 24 soldiers in addition to the four aircrew members. Its range is more than 2,000 miles. (5th, Associated Press)

### British Air Force Launches Fierce Assault on French Coast; British Industrial Areas Also Bombed; Five German Planes Invading Britain Shot Down

London - Last night, British bombers, protected by fighter planes, flew out from the south coast and fiercely attacked French territory. The sound of explosions was incessant. After a while, these British aircraft crossed the British coast again and returned to defense. Yesterday afternoon, residents of Kent suddenly heard a loud explosion on the French coast, as the Central Air Force was attacking northern France. (5th, Reuters)

London - It is said that three German bombers were destroyed when they flew to Britain on Tuesday night for a small-scale attack. Last night, several German planes, using clouds as cover, attempted to cross the Kent coast. They were pursued by Spitfire British planes. Two of the latest Messerschmitt fighter planes were shot down in the Channel, and one British plane was also missing. It is found that this type of German fighter plane is the Me 109 F type, which is an improved version of last year's Me 109 model. Its main feature is that it has a larger engine. When German planes attempted to sneak into the interior, there were several fierce encounters with British planes. The public heard the sound of small cannons and machine guns, and before long they saw a German fighter plane with smoke coming from its tail, fleeing across the Channel. Last night, London issued an alert, and then heard gunfire. Yesterday afternoon, a city in northeastern Scotland was bombed, and several nearby areas were also strafed, with slight material damage and some people injured. A Spitfire British plane fought alone yesterday, shooting down a German dive bomber off the French coast, and strafing enemy observation posts and searchlight teams. It also flew low over a French city and attacked a motorboat before flying back through anti-aircraft fire. (5th, Reuters)

London - German planes again launched a fierce air raid on the industrial areas of West Midland on the morning of the 5th, as the area had experienced in recent weeks, dropping countless incendiary bombs mixed with high-explosive bombs. The air raid began after midnight, and its momentum did not seem to be concentrated on any one place, but at least four cities and towns were hit by incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs. In some other areas, many houses were destroyed, and there were some deaths and injuries. Several streets in one town were hit by multiple bombs, with many deaths and injuries. (5th, Associated Press)

London - Today, the British fishing boat North Star shot down a German Junkers 111 aircraft. The boat was not damaged. (5th, Reuters)

Malta - A few enemy planes attacked twice on Monday night, and most of the bombs they dropped fell into the sea. The few that exploded on land did not destroy anything or injure anyone. On Wednesday morning, several German fighter planes flew over the island for reconnaissance, but were met with land defenses. (5th, Reuters)

British and German Aircraft Bombing Each Other's Ships

The Cairo Middle East Military Bulletin stated that after receiving a reconnaissance report, the British Air Force dispatched bombers yesterday to attack a squadron of enemy merchant ships sailing south off the coast of Tunisia, escorted by destroyers. One enemy ship of 8,000 tons carrying cargo was hit by a bomb and exploded violently, with fragments hitting other ships. One bomber was also hit by high-flying fragments and crashed into the sea. Another enemy ship of 5,000 tons carrying cargo was hit by a bomb and caught fire, and other ships were also damaged. British fighter planes shot down an Italian three-engine plane in the sea off Malta, and a British plane destroyed an Italian seaplane while scouting off the island of Western Filonia. In the Cyrenaica region, South African fighter planes strafed several enemy planes in the Gambut airfield and destroyed them. Benghazi was again attacked at night on June 1, and the embankment and military buildings caught fire. (5th, Reuters)

Berlin - A German news agency said that a German plane recently dropped three bombs on a British transport ship en route to Alexandria, hitting and damaging it. Two other ships maneuvered and were not bombed. (5th, Reuters)

### British Land and Air Forces Occupy Mosul District; Oil Stations and Oil Wells Are Safe; Iraqi Young King Returns to Baghdad Immediately

Cairo - According to military sources here, British air and land forces occupied Mosul on Tuesday. However, because the news is brief, it is not yet known whether the British forces encountered resistance. From the phenomenon, it can be observed that each oil station suffered special damage, and the oil wells are all intact. (5th, Reuters)

London - It is said that the Iraqi authorities in the Mosul and Kirkuk districts seem to have followed the instructions of the Baghdad government. Therefore, Kirkuk is no longer in the hands of the rebels. According to Kirkuk, it is closest to the center of the Iraqi oil fields. (5th, Reuters)

London - According to news from Baghdad, Ali Gailani only carried £120 when he fled to Iran. £150,000 in cash is still stored in his residence outside Baghdad.

London - An official British bulletin announced that the occupation of Mosul can be said to have brought an end to the suppression of unrest in Iraq, but the final step is still needed, namely, to reoccupy the oil fields around Kirkuk. British infantry seem to be heading to Kirkuk as soon as possible. (5th, Associated Press)

### German War Report

Berlin - This afternoon, the German war report stated that German submarines sank 24,000 tons of enemy cargo in the northern and central Atlantic. German speedboats risked attacking the east coast of England, sinking one Central auxiliary cruiser. Several enemy destroyers pursued German speedboats without success. Last night, German planes fiercely bombed military targets and industrial buildings in central and southern England. Factories in Birmingham and port construction in Chatham suffered heavy damage. The Wick airfield on the east coast of Scotland was also attacked, and factories in northern Scotland were bombed during the day, with one building hit by a bomb and destroyed. Yesterday afternoon and evening, enemy planes attempted to fly over the German-occupied area without success. German planes took off to intercept them, very agile. Six enemy bombers were shot down. Only one British plane flew into German territory, reaching the vicinity of Schleswig-Holstein. No enemy planes flew into German airspace last night. (5th, Haitian News Agency)

### Eight British Merchant Ships Sunk by Mines

New York - Yesterday, the Maritime Commission announced that eight British merchant ships totaling 53,908 tons were recently sunk by torpedoes less than 700 miles from the U.S. coast. This matter has made U.S. officials realize that the danger in the Western Hemisphere is increasing. According to the commission's announcement, the ships sunk by torpedoes were: the 13,037-ton tanker San Felix, the 5,356-ton Rosemill, the 8,470-ton tanker American Security, the 4,974-ton Darlington Court, the 4,553-ton Lanmiris, the 4,662-ton Stanclaus, the 6,373-ton tanker Silveryer, and the 6,483-ton MacDougall.

### Foreign Minister's Report on International Situation: Strengthening Southern Garrisons

Constantinople, Turkey - According to sources here, the Turkish Foreign Minister reported to the Republican People's Party parliamentarians on the international situation of the past three weeks, lasting four and a half hours. The Minister of Defense and the Minister of Education were thus unable to deliver their scheduled reports. Furthermore, according to a special correspondent of the Havas News Agency, the Turkish Foreign Minister, when reporting to the People's Party parliamentarians on the international situation, focused on the situation in Syria. In view of the attitude of the British press and the news of the concentration of troops in northern Palestine, a war is likely to break out in Syria. Currently, the Turkish garrison in the south has been strengthened. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 5th)

Ankara - The Turkish National Assembly will decide at its next meeting whether to adjourn on June 20th, as the current international situation is very tense. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 5th)

### Egyptian Cabinet Undergoing Reshuffle; Prime Minister Retains Post

Cairo - The Egyptian cabinet is currently undergoing a reshuffle. Last night, all cabinet members submitted their resignations to the Prime Minister, who also resigned from his post to King Farouk of Egypt. It is expected that the cabinet reshuffle will be completed today, with the Prime Minister retaining his post. The Wafd Party still refuses to join the cabinet. This is purely a domestic political issue and has absolutely no connection with foreign affairs, as the Wafd Party and other parties disagree on the issue of wartime national elections. The idea of further expanding the government's base is currently welcomed by the general public here. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### French Military Observers Speculate on Future Offensive Targets of Germany and Italy: Eastward to Suez Canal, Westward to Gibraltar; Germany Denies Plans to Organize "United States of Europe"

Vichy - Military observers here have recently speculated on the direction of future offensives by the Axis powers. They generally believe that the idea of Germany directly invading Britain is unlikely to materialize for the time being. Therefore, there are only two courses of action to follow in the future: one is to target the Suez Canal and attack the eastern Mediterranean, and the other is to target Gibraltar and attack the western Mediterranean. The two may be carried out simultaneously or in sequence. If they are successful one after the other, the Mediterranean will become an "inland lake" of Germany and Italy. However, if Germany and Italy want to do something in the western Mediterranean, they must first make diplomatic preparations, which does not seem to be considered at this time. In the eastern Mediterranean, the situation is clearer, as the Aegean Islands are already in the hands of the Axis powers. In the future, they may use paratroopers to advance on the Nile to attack Egypt, or use the air force to attack the British island of Cyprus. Comparing the two, the latter seems more difficult, as attacking Cyprus is no less difficult than the previous attack on Crete. This is because the defenses on the island are more substantial, and the island is closer to British air bases, making it easier for British aircraft to provide support in the event of an emergency. It is quite far from the Axis air bases, unlike Crete, which is very close. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 4th)

Lyon - What military decisions were made during the meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy at the Brenner Pass? Political figures here remain silent. However, "The Times" recently commented, "At present, the eyes of the world are focused on the Suez Canal and Alexandria. The future actions of Germany and Italy may develop in this direction. However, German military actions have always aimed to win by surprise, so it is difficult to predict at this time. However, a review of the map shows that various military actions can be taken in the eastern Mediterranean. However, the last British base in that area is Cyprus. Regarding the political issues discussed at this meeting between the German and Italian leaders, it is possible that they have reached important conclusions to drive Britain out of the European continent and thoroughly exchange views on the construction of a new European order." (Havas News Agency dispatch, 4th)

Vichy - Diplomatic figures are paying close attention to the news that the Axis powers will focus on reorganizing Europe in the future. Since the end of the Battle of Crete, the Axis military operations in the Balkans have been completed. It was generally believed that Hitler and Mussolini's meeting at the Brenner Pass would have decided on the nature of future military actions. However, according to news received today, the main purpose of the talks between the German and Italian leaders is still mostly in the economic and diplomatic realms, as they believe that the time for realizing the so-called "Axis Africa" has arrived. Before the war, Europe had to import wheat, coal, iron, oil, cotton, and other goods from overseas every year. At the same time, European countries, on the one hand, never fully utilized their own resources due to the implementation of free economic policies, and on the other hand, they produced various substitutes in order to break free from foreign economic constraints. Now that France has decided to implement a European policy, if it can utilize its African colonies, it will certainly make a significant contribution to the European reorganization plan. However, in order to realize the connection between Europe and Africa, it is necessary to first have freedom of the seas. Therefore, under the current circumstances, the only way is to enable the European continent to be economically self-sufficient as soon as possible. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 4th)

Berlin - According to a report from the American news agency that Hitler will organize a "United States of Europe" next week, the external spokesperson here called it completely unfounded. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 5th)

### Tense Situation in Gibraltar; Over a Thousand Civilians Evacuated

La Línea, Spain - The British transport ship "City of Hilter Mothil" was escorted by two destroyers yesterday, carrying 1,500 civilians evacuated from Gibraltar. It is reported that the British Navy and Air Force in Gibraltar have concentrated and conducted night defense exercises. It is reported that the British ship "Linon," two aircraft carriers, several cruisers, and many destroyers are now stationed in Gibraltar. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)

### British Parliamentarians to Demand Smaller War Cabinet, Conscription of Labor for Production, Removal of Ineffective Ministers

London - Reuters parliamentary sources have learned that when Parliament reconvenes, the British military's withdrawal from Crete will be debated. British Prime Minister Churchill and Labor Party leader Attlee will both participate in the debate. The British military's withdrawal from Crete has concretized criticisms of the government in some quarters. The main points of these criticisms are: demand a smaller war cabinet and remove any minister whose effectiveness is slack without the slightest hesitation. Therefore, this debate will involve many aspects and demand that Britain use faster and newer methods to move towards the ultimate victory that the country is determined to achieve and to simplify the government itself and the organization controlling production. Other issues that will be raised include: (1) conscription of the entire industry, including labor; (2) focus on production, with everything based on production; (3) obtain machinery from overseas as much as possible, even if it reduces grain imports; (4) implement stricter and more comprehensive rationing of various items; (5) expand the domestic movement to produce food and other necessary supplies. What many parliamentarians are most concerned about is the issue of government organization and production, especially labor. The government has repeatedly refused to reduce the war cabinet, but in this debate, parliamentarians will do their best to demand the simplification of the wartime government. As for the conscription of labor, it is what the Labor Party is unwilling to do, so it has not been implemented for a long time. However, if labor and the entire industry are conscripted at the same time, then the criticisms of production methods heard at this week's Labor Party Congress can be regarded as the Labor Party also acknowledging that the labor problem must be handled fairly. Now all parties agree that the conscription of industry is a fair idea. Parliamentarians also demand that civil defense affairs, which are currently managed by six ministries, be managed by a single minister. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

### Avoid Repeating Recent Failures

Canberra - Australian Prime Minister Menzies declared today that the Australian Federal Government is in constant contact with London regarding the lessons learned from the Middle East campaign. He also said that all possible steps will be taken to avoid repeating recent failures. All we can do is take the most active steps to strengthen our future position. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)

Sydney - Labor representative Besley at the War Conference said today that the British defeat in the Battle of Crete was a tragedy. He said, "It is tragic to think that our troops suffered greatly due to the lack of proper equipment and complete air force. Those who have the responsibility to give Australians the opportunity to fight wherever the war occurs should take this incident as their final lesson. The Australian government must ensure that the British government guarantees sufficient air force protection for Australian troops in the future. The War Conference will discuss the situation in Crete tomorrow. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)

Berlin - According to sources here, when the German army was clearing the remnants on Crete, it captured another 2,000 British soldiers, bringing the total number of British soldiers captured on the island to 10,000. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 5th)

### Random Notes on the European War (61): A Comprehensive View of the Atlantic War

The anti-aircraft guns on the other side of the river mouth fired. The shells were loaded into the gun barrel, the gun body rotated, searching for enemy aircraft. The rumbling sound was endless. The enemy aircraft struggled for a while, then swayed and fell.

The various battle conditions described above were performed five times in one night. It was not until four days later that an armored fishing boat brought back a part of the wreckage of the aircraft that the battle results were known.

The fish-belly white of dawn shone on a small coastal town. At that time, the tide was just right, and a team of fishing boats raised their sails. The small boats were suddenly very busy, and the winch began to move as the iron chain passed through it.

The fishing fleet set out to sea, just as before, but this time their target was a new type of fish. Their clothing was quite similar to naval uniforms. However, this "smart" uniform of the regular navy seemed not very comfortable on these reservists.

The fishing boats advanced through the waves outside the harbor. When they encountered floating mines resembling small submarines brushing against the side of the ship, they lowered the mine-sweeping cables. These fishing boats carried out mine-sweeping work on the designated sea area. These small boats patrolled the British coast every day, regardless of wind or rain, keeping the inland sea routes safe.

Sometimes the mine-sweeping cable suddenly got caught, and a black monster emerged from the water. The fishing boat behind immediately opened fire. With a thunderous sound, the sea water shot straight into the sky, and another threat to navigation was removed. Although this seems insignificant in the Atlantic War, it is ultimately a blow to the enemy.

Sometimes the small boats failed to sweep the mines and accidentally hit them, then the Navy Department would have to regretfully announce the loss of another mine-sweeping boat the next day.

The dangers encountered by the coastal patrol boats were not only below the surface of the sea. Sometimes a buzzing sound suddenly rose from the sky. A black group could be seen in the distance, indicating that German bombers had arrived in formation. One of them swayed slightly for a while, then rushed down. The machine gunners on the fishing boat stuck to their posts, waiting for the opportunity to open fire. When the dive bomber dropped to within fifty yards, they fired at its unprotected nose. The bomber suffered this fatal blow and could never soar through the air again. It crashed straight into the sea. With a loud bang, even the sails and masts were broken. It turned out that the boat and the aircraft were so close to each other.

When the fishing boats steered back into port, the channel had been temporarily cleared. But who knows whether there will still be no mines tomorrow morning? The German army may have been busy all night, repeating their old tricks, so the fishing boats had to spend the night in the harbor reluctantly and then go out to patrol again. These coastal "housewives" engaged in mine-sweeping work day after day. The British shipping industry is currently facing an unprecedented threat, and the damage caused by mines is by no means small. No matter how the British convoys change their routes, they must reach a port, and these ports have become the target of attacks.

The air raid alarm in a coastal town suddenly stopped, and the anti-aircraft guns immediately exploded under the enemy aircraft. The whole town was in darkness, and suddenly flares slowly descended to the ground. The sky was bright, and the machine guns roared, hoping to shoot it down. Then there was a long whistle in the air, followed by a loud bang. Suddenly, fires broke out everywhere, and the explosions were endless. A bomb hit the air raid shelter, and perhaps a hundred people died as a result.

This bombing seemed to focus on the residents of the harbor, not the harbor facilities. The target of the German aircraft seemed to be the men and women workers, not their factories.

However, the night air raids did not prevent the workers from going to work the next morning. In the shipyards and docks, the sound of riveting machines and cranes still did not stop. Because of the blackout, the workers could not work at night, so they tried to change it to daytime as much as possible. These people who went to the docks every day were also participating in the Atlantic War.

Although they had gone through a night of tension and terror, they still went to work the next day. They had to pass through the ruins of destroyed houses and churches, and the ruins of the only entertainment venue, the cinema.

Another scene was far from the actual battle. In an office in London, many people were buried in various charts and statistics. They carefully calculated and issued a notice a few hours later saying that the meat ration for next week had to be slightly reduced. A group of middle-aged women turned back in frustration in front of dozens of butcher shops on the island of Britain. Men who took on heavy wartime work returned home and sat down to eat some vegetarian food. Men and women who usually worked part-time in wartime work, such as fire watchmen, also had to reduce their consumption of tea. It turned out that the British people generally liked to drink tea, and the daily consumption was very large.

The menus in major hotels had marks next to some dish names, implying that guests could choose one of fish, meat, or eggs, but could not eat two flavors at the same time. In large and small restaurants – the chefs in large restaurants wore honorary ribbons, and the landladies in small restaurants also managed the purchasing of side dishes, and the sons worked as cooks and waiters – new experiments were also being made on food, using British-produced vegetables to entertain guests with novel cooking methods. If you were a welcome old customer in the shop, the landlady could tell him in a low voice that some meat had been specially left for him.

Hotel owners and customers, butchers and housewives were all participating in the Atlantic War in the same way.

The red sun was gradually setting, and the night enveloped the dim water surface. Solemn cruisers, reflecting the red light of the sky, appeared and disappeared on the horizon, patrolling back and forth, searching for enemy ships. The situation in the Naval Staff Office was always tense, listening to reports and moving the prototype ships on the huge map. At the air station, the mechanics loaded bombs onto the bomb racks, busily checking the engines, and the pilots leisurely finished their after-dinner coffee and strolled around.

These were all fighters in this war. However, the office workers who went home in the city to eat meals without meat, sugar, or butter were also participating in the battle in the same way. Far overseas in Canada, the work in the steel mills continued all night. The flames of the steel mills in Pittsburgh, USA, made the night scene unusually beautiful. A group of strong men were working hard and sweating there, but they did not know that they were also participating in the Atlantic War, no less than the lookouts on the battlefield.

### The Clouds of the Pacific are Worsening; Conflict Between the US and Japan is Inevitable; Both Sides are Approaching a "Showdown"; The Dutch East Indies Issue is Gradually Entering a Serious Stage

A mainland newspaper editorial said that the threat of war in the Pacific region is approaching, and the effectiveness of the US opposition to Japan's expansionist policy is increasing. It is claimed that the United States will assist China in its war against Japan with 100 long-range bombers, along with American pilots and technicians. A spokesman for the Japanese cabinet's intelligence department declared that if the United States allows its aviators and mechanics to resign from the US Aviation Department to serve China, this action will be regarded as an unfriendly act.

Tokyo Chants Loud, Radical Remarks

It is claimed that the Japanese have solemnly declared that if the United States goes to war with Nazi Germany, Japan will inevitably clash with the United States. The semi-official Japanese newspaper Ko Chiho also declared that Japan has no choice but to aid Germany due to its obligations. At the same time, it asked the United States to pay attention to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's formal statement on this matter. Currently, the economic negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies have not developed to Japan's satisfaction. Some Tokyo newspapers, in their editorials, demand that the Japanese government abandon its "undecided policy" and take severe steps, believing that the stubbornness of the Dutch East Indies is due to the support of Britain and the United States in the rear.

Enraged by US Aid to China

US Secretary of State Hull declared that after the restoration of peace, the United States will abandon its consular jurisdiction in China. This matter is also regarded as a blow to Japan, as this move further reflects Japan's policy of aggression, and Japanese newspapers even call Hull's letter to the new Foreign Minister of Chongqing, Guo Taiqi, merely a piece of paper. Japan believes that the United States is preventing its development in the Pacific region, and is enraged.

Predict Conflict is Inevitable

Washington is also aware of the increasingly tense situation in the Far East. The United States and Japan in the Pacific region are approaching a "showdown". We are not deliberately making alarmist remarks, but in view of the progress of all situations, it seems that open conflict is almost inevitable. Japan is trying its best to escape the difficulties that it has been trapped in by the warlords. The United States adheres to its traditional policy and is unwilling to compromise with unreliable people like the leaders of the Axis powers. The American people are even more unwilling to take actions that are contrary to their moral beliefs. Therefore, unless the Japanese government changes its attitude in the near future, the inevitability of a US-Japan conflict is almost certain.

### Slaughterhouse Rentals; Panic in the Slaughtering Industry; Business Was Already Plummeting; Further Control Will Leave Nothing Behind

Shanghai's slaughtering industry, taking the pig slaughtering industry as an example, is divided into two types: the local gang and the Suzhou gang. The local gang is from Jiangyin Chongming, and the Suzhou gang is mostly from Wuxi Lai, residing in the Nanyang Bridge area of the French Concession and the North Chengdu Road area of the Public Concession. Before the war, including the pig slaughtering in the British and French Concessions and the Zhabei in the South City, there were no less than three or four hundred workshops. Each workshop hired three or four or more than ten apprentices. Slaughtering a pig only cost 40 cents to 70 cents from the meat dealer. All the pig bristles were shared by the workshop owner and the apprentices, and the pig blood belonged to the workshop owner. At least more than 3,000 pigs were slaughtered every day. The slaughtering masters made a lot of profit.

Profiting Handsomely

Since the war, it has been difficult to operate in Zhabei in the South City, and pig slaughtering is done exclusively in the British and French Concessions. There are private workshops in Caojiadu and Xujiahui. The slaughterhouse in the French Concession is the so-called fake cattle slaughtering company. For each pig, the company charges 50 cents, and the workshop charges 1 yuan and 30 cents for slaughtering. In addition, there is a meat dealer and a slaughtering association fee of 10 cents each. The Public Concession is located at the Xinninghai Slaughterhouse on North Chengdu Road. The Suzhou and Wuxi slaughterhouses slaughter pigs. Xinninghai is the local gang, charging 1 yuan, 11 cents and 5 points for the company fee per pig, 1 yuan and 20 cents for the slaughtering fee, and 20 cents for the meat dealer and the slaughtering association fee. The Suzhou and Wuxi slaughterhouses are run by the meat dealers themselves. They hire apprentices to slaughter pigs and do not need the pig slaughtering workshops to slaughter them.

Continuing to This Day

With a long history, no less than tens of thousands of people rely on pig slaughtering for a living. Since the source of live pigs has been controlled by a certain party, and the production in Jiangbei is very low, it is not cost-effective for farmers to raise pigs because of the high price of food. As a result, the entire Shanghai has only more than 1,000 pigs per day, which is not enough for distribution. It is not easy for meat dealers to get a pig. There are also many slaughterers who cannot get a pig to slaughter every day. The industry has plummeted, and the price of meat has soared. Unexpectedly, the news came that the pig slaughtering industry must also be controlled, and the slaughterhouse of the工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) will be rented. In the future, the pigs in both Concessions will not be slaughtered by pig slaughterers. The industry is related to the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people. The meat industry and the pig slaughtering association jointly resolutely oppose it, and they are running around and appealing to all parties to cancel it. It has been half a month, and there are no concrete results. Today, it is heard that the工部局's slaughterhouse has decided to rent it out. The slaughtering industry has a great impact.

Great Impact

It has appealed to all sectors, requesting assistance, and in order to maintain the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people, representatives were immediately dispatched to visit the responsible authorities of the工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council), saying that in order to protect their legal operations and to remember the impact on society if thousands of colleagues in the city are unemployed as a result of this move, the lease contract should not be signed, so that the Suzhou merchants can get out of their difficulties and save their lives.

### New Restrictions on British Residents Going to Japan; Must Have Consent of Japanese Foreign Ministry Before Passport Can Be Issued

According to news released by the Japanese Consulate General here yesterday, all British people who are going to Japan in the future and who apply to the Japanese Consulate for passport re-endorsement must obtain the consent of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo before they can be approved. When the reporter inquired about this with the British Consulate General, a senior official said that they were not aware of this matter, so they were unwilling to comment on it. According to well-informed diplomatic sources, the new restrictions imposed by Japan on British residents are enough to prove that British-Japanese relations are becoming more tense.

### Coolidge Ship Commandeered: Last Voyage Departs Shanghai Yesterday for Hong Kong and Manila, Clifford Expected to Arrive Next Week

The splendid passenger ship, President Coolidge, of the American President Lines arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the 4th, entered the Huangpu River, and brought several key American businessmen to the city. This visit of the President Coolidge to Shanghai may be its last during the current emergency, as the ship has been purchased by the U.S. government to meet urgent needs.

Departed Yesterday for Manila

The ship arrived in Shanghai from Honolulu via Japan. It was scheduled to set sail from Shanghai yesterday at 5:30 PM for Hong Kong and Luzon. In addition to the 287 passengers who came from the U.S. on the original ship bound for Southeast Asia, more than 119 people from Shanghai also boarded the ship to Hong Kong and Luzon.

Return Trip to the US Will Berth at Kobe

An official of the President Lines stated yesterday morning that the President Coolidge will stop at Kobe on its return trip to the US.  Departing from the US en route from Honolulu to Shanghai, it will not stop in Japan according to the newly established schedule. However, World Class ships will still berth at various ports in Japan on their way from the US.

Ten Military Officers Will Go to Beiping Immediately

Among the American businessmen who arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge were Mr. Ke Wei, manager of the Shanghai Ford Motor Company, Mr. Stein, manager of the Shanghai branch of American President Lines, and Mr. Legas, manager of the Shanghai branch of American Express Bank. Ten U.S. Marine Corps officers, led by Lieutenant Colonel Yasusde, will go to Beiping. It is heard that Mr. Ya will go to Beiping to serve as the commander of the U.S. forces there. From 1930 to 1933, Mr. Ya was stationed in Shanghai. Nine officers, including Major Cen Sen, accompanied him on this trip.

Clifford Ship's Arrival in Shanghai Postponed

The President Clifford, on its return trip from Luzon via Hong Kong to Shanghai and back to the U.S., was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 7th). According to the company's announcement, it will be postponed until next Wednesday (the 11th) to arrive in port and will leave Shanghai for the U.S. on the 12th.

The new World Class passenger ship President Jackson, on its first circumnavigation, should arrive in Shanghai next Monday (the 9th) according to the scheduled voyage, and depart from Shanghai for Southeast Asian ports on the 10th to circumnavigate back to the US. It was previously rumored that the ship had been commandeered by the U.S. government. The Shanghai branch of the President Lines has not received any notification from the head office, so the reservation of berths is still being processed as usual. However, as of this order, there is no telegram indicating whether the ship will arrive in Shanghai on schedule.

### Authorities Gradually Tighten Controls; Rice Merchants Gradually Restricted; Newly Ordered Hong Kong Rice and Saigon Rice Expected to Arrive Within the Month

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council began selling affordable low-grade rice, sales of rice handled by private businesses have become scarce. Inland dealers rarely purchase, and most local businesses are paying attention to the affordable low-grade rice, creating a situation where supply greatly exceeds demand. Recently, foreign firms have received telegrams from Yangon and Siam offering to sell low-grade and No. 2 Siamese rice. Although they have tried to lower the prices as much as possible, no one is interested. If foreign rice continues to pour in, the market price of rice will further decline. Therefore, legitimate rice merchants will now handle the Shanghai Municipal Council's affordable low-grade rice to seek legitimate profits and avoid unexpected losses.

Reporting Required for Rice Sales in the Extraterritorial Areas

Yesterday, a person in charge of the Public Concession of the Shanghai Municipal Council told reporters that rice shops in the extraterritorial road areas must, starting today, collect a reporting booklet from the Xiangmao Foreign Firm at No. 1 The Bund and report the quantity of foreign rice sold by the Shanghai Municipal Council each day and the addresses of the buyers. After each rice shop fills it out, they should submit it to the police station in charge of the area for the authorities to check. Failure to comply with the above procedures will result in the cancellation of their right to sell.

Second Batch of 10,000 Tons of Hong Kong Rice Ordered

Since the Shanghai Municipal Council began selling affordable Hong Kong rice, the first batch has long been sold out. The second batch will begin to be sold within the week, and various grain stores continue to place orders enthusiastically. It is reported that yesterday alone, the quantity ordered from Xiangmao Foreign Firm reached more than 2,000 tons, totaling about 10,000 tons including previous orders. The number of foreign firms fixing rice has increased from twelve to sixteen. The Shanghai Municipal Council has informed the Hong Kong government of the quantity ordered by each rice shop and requested that ships be dispatched to Shanghai as soon as possible. It is heard that it will arrive in Shanghai before the 10th of this month.

Affordable Saigon Rice to Be Loaded This Month

Regarding the Shanghai French Concession's Board of Directors contacting the Vietnamese government to directly order No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon mixed broken rice to be shipped to Shanghai for affordable sale, the French authorities previously consulted with the Shanghai rice industry several times to act as distributors and stipulated that the profit for the rice merchants should be (1) 8% for the rice shops and (2) 5% for the rice retailers. All transactions by foreign firms must be registered by the French authorities. It is learned that French firm Dafu and British firm Heyi have successively concluded transactions totaling about 1,000 tons. According to the person in charge of each foreign firm, the affordable Saigon rice that has already been transacted can be loaded from the producing areas this month and is expected to arrive in port and be resold by the end of this month.

Registration Required to Sell Hong Kong Rice

Since the distribution of the second batch of affordable low-grade rice, various retail rice shops in the city have purchased from twelve grain stores such as Ruichangfa. However, a small number of rice shops have not filled out the "Application Form for Selling Foreign Rice of the Shanghai Municipal Council" and registered with the Liji Foreign Firm in the past. The foreign rice agency will not approve their purchase for the time being. From now on, retail rice shops wishing to sell the Shanghai Municipal Council's affordable low-grade rice should quickly fill out the "Application Form for Selling Foreign Rice of the Shanghai Municipal Council" and submit it to the grain store from which they purchased the rice, filling out a triplicate form at the same time, and submit it to Liji or Xiangmao Foreign Firm for review and approval before they can sell it.

Market Brokers Feel Very Embarrassed

The more than 200 brokers in the rice market rely on commissions from transactions between buyers and sellers for their daily income, with the larger ones earning two or three hundred yuan and the smaller ones earning fifty or sixty yuan. Their monthly income is quite considerable, but since affordable low-grade rice has continuously arrived in Shanghai, market transactions have suddenly decreased. The past two days have been very slow, so the general brokers cannot use their usual skills, and the situation is very embarrassing. They cannot help but feel the difference between the past and the present.

### Staff of Commercial Press Seek Salary: Executives of Management Refuse to Meet; Wang Yaotang Withdraws Involvement

Yesterday morning, representatives of the Commercial Press went to the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the law office of Wang Yaotang to hear back. Mr. Wang stated that the situation of the labor side was indeed pitiable and that he expressed his sympathy. The attitude of the management was stubborn and they refused to meet, making it impossible to start mediation. He has decided to withdraw from the matter and not get involved. An official of the Industrial Section said that he hoped that the representatives would submit specific opinions on Notice No. 372 for transfer to the management, which might allow the Industrial Section to conduct individual negotiations as an intermediary. The representatives believed that the future was still very bleak. In addition, the salary for the second half of May has not been issued. They decided to lead more than 100 laid-off employees to petition the homes of Manager Bao Qinglin and Hong Kong-based Commissioner Li Bojia. Although there were many people, the order was exceptionally good and there was no loss whatsoever. Manager Bao refused to meet, and his wife received them. At about 4 PM, the police sent a large number of detectives to drive the crowd away from Bao's house. They could not enter Li Bojia's house, so the colleagues had to return in the rain.

### Workers at the Mi Feng Factory Clash with Police; Western and Japanese Police Officers Injured; Three Workers Seriously Injured in the Head

At 5:30 AM yesterday (the 4th), a labor strike riot occurred at the Mi Feng Woolen Mill at No. 400 Poyang Road in East Shanghai. Mr. Ma Lixun, a Western probationary patrolman of the Yangshupu Police Station, and a Japanese police officer of the Police Station were injured. After the labor strike occurred at the factory, at 5:30 PM that afternoon, all the workers were refused entry into the factory and gathered on the roadside. The workers demanded that the factory issue wages, but they were rejected by the factory. All the male and female workers, numbering about 100, clashed with the management. After receiving the report, the Yangshupu Police Station quickly dispatched police officers to suppress the riot and disperse the crowd of workers. At that time, the workers did not obey, and the police arrested eight workers with batons and took them back for interrogation. During the mutual fighting, Western patrolman Ma Lixun was hit in the forehead and knees and was sent to the hospital for treatment. The Japanese police officer was also slightly injured, and three workers were seriously injured in the head and were immediately sent to the police hospital for treatment. It will be difficult to discharge them for the time being.

### Bank Director and University Staff Abducted One After Another: Zhang Bokou Kidnapped on Avenue Albert, Shi Zhaokang Abducted by Three Russians

In the past two days, two kidnapping cases have occurred in the city. One of the kidnapped was Zhang Bokou, director of the Yanye Bank, and the other was Shi Zhaokang, registrar of St. John's University. Both of them have disappeared after being kidnapped. The details of the valleys are recorded separately as follows.

Salt Industry Director Abducted Yesterday Morning

Yesterday on Avenue Albert in the French Concession, Zhang Bokou, chief auditor of the Yanye Bank, was kidnapped along with his car. The stolen car was soon discovered, but Zhang's whereabouts are unknown. The details of the kidnapping case are recorded below.

Serving for Many Years

Zhang Bokou, a Henan native, is 44 years old and resides in a foreign house at No. 16, Peifuli, No. 168, Avenue Albert, French Concession, Shanghai. Zhang has served as a director and chief auditor of the Yanye Bank at No. 280 Beijing Road in the city for many years. Although Zhang usually travels in a black-plated car with number 6010, the car is a public car of the bank for Zhang to ride in, rather than a privately owned one.

Suddenly Encountered Kidnappers

Yesterday morning, Zhang had a friend from his hometown, Mr. Lu, who arrived in Shanghai by boat from Beiping. Zhang ate breakfast at about 8:00 AM and went out to board the car, intending to go to the Roosevelt Wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to meet Mr. Lu first, and then go to the office. Unexpectedly, just as the car left the alleyway, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and stopped the car. Each took out a gun, jumped into the car, and drove the driver, Kong Qinghe from Yangzhou, out of the car.

Car Found

The car was driven away by the kidnappers, and the kidnapping disappeared without a trace. The driver, Kong Qinghe, saw that the kidnappers had left, so he reported the information to Zhang's family and then reported it to the French police. After sending detectives to investigate, they strictly ordered their subordinates to pay attention to the investigation. It was not until 10:45 AM that the police found the car with that number at No. 508 Julai Road and immediately notified the driver, Kong Qinghe, to go and claim it, but Zhang was still missing.

University Staff Abducted

Shi Zhaokang, registrar of St. John's University, 37 years old, left the school building at No. 188 Jessfield Road at 9:15 AM the day before yesterday and hired a rickshaw to return to his residence on Kangnuo Road. While passing through Caojiadu, a car suddenly chased after him.

Handcuffed

Three Russians and two Chinese men jumped out of the car, all with guns, and forcibly dragged Shi off the car, handcuffed him, and then pushed him into the car and drove away along Jessfield Road. The car's license plate number has not been disclosed. After St. John's University moved back to its original site in Zhaofeng Park a year ago, Shi and several other staff members were the first to return to the school.

Political Motivation

This kidnapping is likely politically motivated, and the fact that there are three Russians in the bandit gang is rare in kidnapping cases in Shanghai. The Shanghai West Special Police is currently investigating the case and providing special protection to other staff members of St. John's University. However, no suspects have been arrested as of yesterday. Many people in the city's education circles know Mr. Shi and were shocked to hear the news.

### Rice Prices Fall Daily; Shoe Industry Reduces Wages; The First Wage Reduction Since the Labor Strike

The labor and management of the local footwear industry had a dispute in April of this year due to the labor side's demand for increased wages. The labor strike was deadlocked for a month, and then it was partially resolved by both sides, with a uniform increase of 30% in wages. At that time, both sides signed a treaty stating that when the price of rice fell, the increased portion would be reduced at any time. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council has been operating Hong Kong rice to maintain the people's food supply, and the price of rice has been declining daily. The wages in the industry have been reduced by 20% in proportion starting this month.

### Advertising on the Back of Rickshaws; Public Concession Approved, French Concession Still Under Negotiation

The plan to use the back of public rickshaws for advertising has been approved by the Public Concession of Shanghai Municipal Council, but there are still difficulties. It is heard that the French Concession Public Car Bureau does not allow rickshaws within the concession to carry such advertising. Since rickshaws in the Public Concession can travel in the French Concession, if the back of the car is used for advertising, the car will not be allowed to enter the French Concession, so whether this plan can be realized is still a problem. The relevant parties may consult with the French Concession Public Works Bureau again and see that since the Shanghai Municipal Council has already approved it, the general public believes that the French Concession Public Works Bureau may revoke this ban. According to the Shanghai Municipal Council, it intends to collect a special tax of one yuan per month for rickshaws carrying such advertising, and paper advertising products may not be used, and all advertising products must first be approved by the Police Department.

### Thieves Posing as Investigators Break Into Westerner's Home

The French Concession Police Department has recently received reports that thieves impersonating health inspectors, claiming to be experts from the Health Department, have gone to Westerners' homes under the guise of investigation. Many Westerners have had cash and valuables stolen, so they are conducting a thorough investigation to ascertain the truth, investigate the criminals, and warn the public to pay attention.

### Airmail Routes to the Americas and Europe: European Mail Carried by American Aircraft Is the Fastest; Entire Journey from Hong Kong Takes Only Two Weeks

Since the outbreak of war in Europe, the number of ships has decreased and the entrances to various coastal ports have been blockaded. Mail to various European countries is no longer routed through the Suez Canal. For safety, the post office has changed the route to the Pacific, taking the route through the United States and across the Atlantic to various European countries. Therefore, for the sake of speed, foreign merchants in the city send mail to the above-mentioned regions by air, carried by American Clipper aircraft. According to inquiries with the post office, the routes and fares for airmail to the Americas, Europe, the Near East, Malaya, British Singapore, and French Annam are as follows:

Asia

Airmail to Asia, such as Indochina, Hanoi, Saigon, Siam, and Bangkok, is now carried by Japanese Thai aircraft after British and French aircraft suspended operations after the European war. The route is from Guangzhou (Shanghai to Guangzhou by ship) connecting to Saigon, Hanoi, and Bangkok. The Shanghai Post Office closes at 8 PM on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, and the Guangzhou aircraft depart every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday and can arrive on the same day. The postage is 5 jiao for every 20 centimeters, and the airmail fee is 6 jiao for every 5 centimeters to Hanoi and Saigon and 8 jiao for every 5 centimeters to Bangkok. Registration is an additional 5 jiao. If shipping from Shanghai to Guangzhou is required, the airmail fee is only 4 jiao for every 20 centimeters. For mail to Yangon, Calcutta, Surabaya, Batavia, or Bandung, Iraq, and Baghdad, the airmail fee is 1 yuan and 3 jiao per 5 centimeters. However, it can also be transferred from Hong Kong by Chinese aircraft via Chongqing to Yangon, Singapore, with an additional airmail fee of 2 jiao and 5 fen per 5 centimeters. Because mail to the above-mentioned areas is carried by British overseas aircraft departing from Singapore and Chinese aircraft departing from Hong Kong, it is faster. The airmail fee to Singapore has been reduced to 4 jiao and 5 fen per 5 centimeters.

Europe

In the past, European mail was carried by British Royal Line and French Central Line. The British Royal Line has now been renamed Overseas Line, and the departure point, originally Hong Kong, has been changed to Singapore. The mail is shipped by ship from Shanghai to Singapore for transfer. The post office has no fixed closing time and must wait for the ship schedule. However, the post office has separate notices posted at each post office. French aircraft have long been suspended. In addition to British aircraft flying to various parts of Asia and New Zealand, Sydney, and the islands of Ellice, New Guinea, and Samoa in Australia, if mail is shipped to Europe by British overseas aircraft, it can now only be shipped to Durban in South Africa. This is the airmail hub and the central hub for transshipment. Other parts of Africa such as the Union of South Africa, the Gold Coast, and Nigeria can also be mailed, with an airmail fee of 2 yuan and 4 jiao per centimeter. All European mail can be transferred via the overland route from Durban. As for the Philippines, Egypt, and Sudan, the airmail fee is still 1 yuan and 3 jiao per 5 centimeters.

Americas

Mail to the Americas is now carried by Chinese Clipper aircraft departing from Hong Kong. Except for South and Central America, for mail within the United States (U.S.A.), the airmail fee is 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen per 5 centimeters. For mail to England, France, Holland, Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal, and other European countries, it can also be carried by American aircraft to San Francisco, where it is connected to transatlantic aircraft. The airmail fee is 5 yuan and 4 jiao per 5 centimeters, and the entire journey can be reached in just two days. As for mail to the Philippines, Guam, and Hawaii, it is still carried by American aircraft, and the airmail fee is specified separately. The post office first ships mail to the above-mentioned areas to Hong Kong by the fastest ship, where it connects with the Clipper aircraft departing from Hong Kong. The closing time is also notified separately in notices posted at each post office and is not fixed, as it sometimes has to wait for the nearest ship.

### Customs Allows Import of Cotton Cloth Up to 23 Count

The Ministry of Finance has instructed customs offices in various regions that finished products directly made from cotton yarn of 23 count or less, such as underwear, and cotton yarn used for cotton yarn and cotton cloth that does not exceed 23 count, are all allowed to be imported, regardless of the country of origin or where in the country they come from, and it is not necessary to provide a list of domestically produced goods certified by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.

### Hurricane Rises and Advances Rapidly in the Pacific

The hurricane season in the Pacific is approaching, and another hurricane has recently risen. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Xujiahui Observatory, the hurricane has now reached 27 degrees north latitude and 127 degrees east longitude, that is, the sea east of Taiwan, and is advancing rapidly in the north-east direction. If the wind direction does not change, the Chinese coast can avoid being driven in.

### Leader of Free French Movement in Shanghai Still Imprisoned in Saigon: Trial Still Awaits a Certain Amount of Time; His Lawyer Continues to Telegram Recent Developments to Shanghai

He was detained for a week and then sent to Saigon, where he was imprisoned and treated poorly. It will take a long time before he is formally tried. Aigao's lawyer in Saigon continues to telegram Aigao's wife and his lawyer in Shanghai with updates, stating that the French authorities have appointed a military judge to hear the case and have received the testimony recorded after the Shanghai French authorities interrogated several witnesses. However, Aigao has not yet been formally charged.

### Movie Theater Manager Accused of Assaulting a Patron: Both Parties Reached a Settlement and Withdrew the Lawsuit; Donated 20 Dan of Rice for Charity

Liu Shikun, a cotton yarn merchant residing at No. 24, Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, went to a large newly opened theater on Yu Qiaqing Road with his wife, Zhu, at 9 PM on the 26th of last month to watch a movie. Liu had an accident, so Zhu purchased the ticket first and entered the venue. When Liu arrived, the movie had already started, and the ticket collector

Refused Entry

Liu informed the ticket collector that the ticket had already been purchased by Zhu and asked him to accompany him inside to find her.

Expressed Displeasure

So Liu and Zhu went to the manager's office of the theater with Zhao to reason. Unexpectedly, they were beaten badly by senior theater officials Zhu Pangu and Feng Shizhang.

### Grains Foreign Rice Rises Then Quickly Declines

Yesterday, the price of foreign rice was tight then weak. At the opening of the morning market, village customers took advantage of the low prices to continue buying, and speculators also absorbed a lot. Therefore, sellers raised their prices again. No. 1 Saigon was once offered at 120 yuan, and Small Jiaobai at 115 yuan. However, the Public Works Department continued to release government-sold rice, and large quantities of goods were about to arrive, so people were less anxious. Once the price was raised, sales slowed down again. At the same time, large dealers, seeing no hope for the future of the rice market, also continued to sell off their stocks, so the situation turned weak and trading was sparse. Limited transactions were made in various grades, and the market went downhill all the way until closing, without any rebound. The final settlement prices were: No. 1 Saigon at 118 yuan, 117.5 yuan, No. 114.5 yuan, Min Dang 115-116 yuan, Small Grain 111-112 yuan, Broken Rice 90 yuan, 87.5 yuan. Small Jiao had a new transaction at 123 yuan, with 500 tons offered. Yinghua Company's stockpile of broken rice was well received, with May reaching 104.5 yuan, later down to 102.5 yuan, which was still better than the previous day. Small Jiao spot goods 116.5 yuan to 136 yuan, goods en route 135 yuan, June 115.5 yuan, also leveled off. Total spot transactions for the day were no less than 14,000 to 15,000 bags, and Yinghua Company had nearly 1,000 tons, it is said.

Large Quantity of Foreign Rice Shipped to Tianjin: Jardine Matheson's Fu Sheng ship, loaded with 17,677 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, is scheduled to transport it to Tianjin tomorrow. A large amount of Burmese foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai. (Zu)

Thick and Thin Japonica Rice, etc.: Sales of thick japonica rice remained sluggish, and the market continued to be soft. Early and late rice were well-received, showing no signs of price changes. Kunshan white japonica rice was offered at 130 yuan, 128 yuan. Su Yuan bag at 128 yuan. South Port early and late rice remained as high as 127 yuan, finally settling at 132 yuan, original bag unopened.

Sales of glutinous rice in small quantities were slightly more than before, while market supply was very scarce, and prices increased. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened at 113 yuan, then down to 110 yuan. Glutinous tea 105 yuan, 103 yuan. National glutinous rice 121 yuan, then down to 117 yuan.

### Flour Market Gloomy

The foreign flour market remained sluggish. Trading was sparse in the morning. Only Australian flour with the Flower and Bird brand had some sales in the local market, priced at 29.2 yuan. Bank-owned warehouses did not open. Jinlong flour was offered at 28.4-28.5 yuan, while buyers were only offering 28 yuan, and buying and selling were mutually exclusive. It was heard that 500 bags were traded in the aftermarket for only 28.1-28.2 yuan. Fort flour at 29 yuan still lacked transactions. The market is feared to fluctuate for a time.

The wheat market was easy, but there was still no development. It was found that there were still a small number of old wheat stocks in the Shanghai Concession. Holders, in view of the low flour prices, are waiting for the new wheat to be listed before selling. At present, new wheat is entering the market in the interior, but it has yet to arrive in Shanghai.

### Miscellaneous Grains New Broad Beans Lack Vitality

In the past two days, the broad bean market has been sluggish because sales from Hong Kong and the local market (local retailers mostly transport and sell themselves) have not kept up. Only Nanyang Quanzhou, etc., have inquired, and purchasing has also slowed down. Therefore, the market atmosphere suddenly became sluggish. Yesterday, the market was down by eight jiao from its peak. More than 200 bags of North Port green skin were offered at 42 yuan. Soybeans and corn continued to fall by five to six jiao, and the overall trend remained lifeless. A total of about 2,000 bags of various beans were traded, and more than 2,000 bags of corn were traded.

### Finance Foreign Exchange Experiences Minor Fluctuations

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed exchange rates unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates was stable with a slight loosening. After the morning opening, Chinese banks came to sell, and speculators rushed to take profits, causing the July U.S. dollar to harden to 5.40625. Difficult to close. The US dollar once returned to par due to the intake by a foreign bank. At noon, it was heard that the British exchange rate had loosened to three pence, three and one twenty fifths, so the future U.S. dollar hardened again. In the afternoon, the British bank suddenly came in to absorb profits, and speculators stopped selling and rushed to cover their positions, causing the distant month U.S. dollar to return from loose to par, with the final central gold squeeze at 0.015625. The U.S. dollar was level, and trading was quite lively throughout the day.

Speculators Return to Sell

Since this morning's foreign telegraph silver market, both British and American prices have been level. Indian silver continued to rise, and exchange rates of various countries against the U.S. dollar fell by two and a half, and against Shanghai rose by three points. The exchange rate of British pound against Shanghai fell by 0.03125. Other rates remained unchanged. The central listing of various exchange rates was unchanged. The morning opening of the domestic market saw bank selling prices level for spot goods. British exchange rate was three pence, two and sixty-eight seventy-fifths, and U.S. dollar was 5.375 yuan. Chinese banks initially offered the June U.S. dollar at 5.40625 yuan at a certain American bank. Speculators also had intentions to sell, causing the July term to harden to the quoted price for closing. HSBC's listed exchange rates were unchanged. After the balance tax on silver was still levied at 24.25%, the situation was stable. Around 10 o'clock, foreign banks had better appetite for intake, which seemed to soften. Chinese speculators released the July rate of 5.40625, and it was heard that foreign banks were trading the June British rate at three pence and three, with five trending firmer. At noon closing, the British rate was three pence, three and one twenty-fifth, and the U.S. dollar for July was 5.40625, while the spot and June rate were 5.375.

British Rates Rise, U.S. Dollar Stabilizes

In the afternoon, Chinese speculators initially continued to sell, and absorbed the July term rate of 5.40625. They stopped selling and started to take profits for this month only 5.375, thus turning softer. At the 4 o'clock closing, the spot-to-July term rate was still three pence, three and one twenty-fifth for the British rate, and 5.375 for the U.S. dollar, compared with the previous day's closing price, the current term and the future term were both up by 0.015625 for the British rate, and the U.S. dollar was level.

### Gold Prices Rebound in the Afternoon

Yesterday's gold market saw a red-hot black market that continued to decline and then rebounded, due to the loosening and return to par of foreign exchange. People remained idle, not taking into consideration the European and American situations. On the day, foreign exchange dealers first appeared, then sold short, but securities firms, bank firms, jewelry shops, money exchange shops, and cash shops bought in succession, rising from 6,418 yuan to the evening closing of 6,450 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. Transactions totaled several tens of thousands of taels. Cash saw a lower price due to squeezing, and trading was also thin. Tianyuan bought 20 taels from Wanfeng, and Chengji bought 50 taels from Yongfengyu, both priced 300 yuan higher than the forward price. In the afternoon, Fei Wenyuan sold 50 taels to Shihe at a price 185 yuan higher, a small squeeze compared to the previous day. Jewelry and customs gold remained level.

The morning market reported a soft U.S. dollar, and people were leaning downward. The market opened at 9:15 AM at 6,420 yuan, 16 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. Yuxingyong sold down to 6,418 yuan, while Defu, Gongda, and Hengji came in to buy, and the U.S. dollar rebounded slightly, with the price rising to around 6,430 yuan, remaining stable for a long time. With the U.S. dollar softening, the price rose to 6,440 yuan, sold by Xinfengyong and Dafengyiyuan. At noon, it fell to 6,428 yuan, with Defu buying in, so the noon closing was 6,433 yuan. The afternoon opening at 2:00 PM was immediately higher by 2 yuan, at 6,435 yuan. Xinfengyong and small investors sold down to 6,428 yuan. Suddenly, distant-month U.S. dollars were reported tight, and Shihe, Decheng, Yiyuan, and Gongda came in succession, and the price jumped up by more than 20 yuan, reaching 6,450 yuan, sold by the Xinfengyong bank and small investors. They retreated to 6,443 yuan. The 3:30 PM closing was 6,446 yuan, up 10 yuan from the previous day. The price of 6,479 yuan was quoted for the June U.S. dollar at 5.375, a difference of 33 yuan. After closing, it rose to 6,450 yuan, sold by Hengji. The final price was 6,448 yuan. The total fluctuation for the day was 32 yuan. The selling price of the current brand of gold in cash shops was 300 yuan higher than the price for the red-hot market. The buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was still no price or market for the current standard gold. Jewelry gold was unchanged.

### Minimal Changes in Foreign Currencies

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw firm prices in the red-hot market. British and American gold pounds also rose by one yuan each. British gold tickets remained unchanged, and market prices stabilized. The U.S. dollar ticket saw minimal changes, and ended up squeezing up by one cent, with the evening market at 18 yuan, 1 jiao and 4 fen. Hong Kong tickets had equal supply and demand, and market prices stabilized. Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets both trended softer, with the former retreating to 1 yuan and 9 jiao and 6 fen, and the latter falling to 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 4 fen.

### Discounting is Implicitly Cancelled - Current Exchange and Cash Balances Out

Yesterday, the discount rate for current exchange of notes was implicitly cancelled, and both parties balanced each other out. The interest rate for interbank lending remained unchanged. The money industry association's interest rates remained unchanged. The morning and afternoon markets both opened at seven points.

### Securities Domestic Bonds Receive Goods with Enthusiasm

The black market for public bonds continued to rise yesterday, advancing slowly. Various groups received goods, continuing to buy without retreating, with great enthusiasm. After the Public Works Department stabilized rice prices, speculators gradually became discouraged and slowly released their stocks. The prices of various goods also fell with it. Foreign stocks saw a negative news, and speculators lost interest. As for gold and cotton yarn, they have already switched to trading futures. On the one hand, cash increased, and on the other hand, there were fewer outlets, so there was a surplus of funds, which was more severe than before. It was timely that the public bond environment became more abundant, so investors in public bonds became more prosperous. Yesterday morning, Xinfu, Defu, and Lianyi bought in, while Xiekang, Tongkang, and Shengchang sold out. Trading was not much, and market prices rose slightly by 5 fen and 1 jiao. Trading was brisk in the afternoon. Yuxing, Hongda, and Da entered with strong appetites, and Hengkang, Runde, and Lianyi also had a lot of demand. Others such as Dahua and Yitai also had considerable demand. Tongkang and Jiufeng released some stocks, while Xiekang, Shengsheng, Dada, Dalianhe all sold out. Transactions were mostly concentrated on Type C bonds, causing them to not rise much. Other types were then raised by two or three. About 270 to 280 million yuan were traded. A brief table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 90 shares of Coal Industry Bank shares were traded, at a 55% discount, excluding profits. Another 300 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company shares were traded at a price of 8 yuan.

The public trading hall's stock market continued to be clear and scarce. Among public utilities, only Wharf surged to 95 yuan, closing at 94.5 yuan, rising by one yuan, while the rest only fluctuated by five fen to one jiao. Rubber stocks were particularly stagnant.

### Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Waits for Opportunities, Futures Yarn Made All Day

The yarn market was soft with some firmness, but the momentum on all sides was very strong. This was because the wills of both the bulls and the bears differed. The bulls said that sales had recently improved, the factories were collecting purchase orders, and the shipment of spot goods to other ports continued uninterrupted, with a optimistic mindset. The bears said that the large amount of foreign goods had already been released, and the squeezing out of shorts was more difficult when futures were opened. Therefore, both sides held their positions and mostly watched, waiting for an opportunity to determine the outcome. The high price of 20s Shuangma was 1,428 yuan, and the low price was 1,411 yuan. The afternoon opening continued to be soft following the morning's sluggishness, priced at 1,421 yuan. Then, with the rise in standard gold, people's hearts turned upward, and the market rose to 1,435 yuan, with the final price at 1,424 yuan, and some were looking to buy.

Shuangma's morning opening was peaceful and dispersed. The first lot was priced at 1,428 yuan. Once this lot was opened, there were more sellers and fewer buyers on the table, and it gradually fell to 1,421 yuan. However, as the price loosened, those making profits moved to cover their positions, and the market returned to rise a step. It hovered between 1,433 and 1,434 yuan for quite a while. Later, it rose again to 1,427 yuan, and shorts sold again, loosening back to 1,413 and 1,414 yuan at closing. It was found that the statistics for trading in half a day were 5,440 bales. The amount of purchases made by various groups is listed as follows:

Same industry 5,100 Hong Kong 340

Total 5,440

The standard gold transform horse futures market has been open since the 2nd of this month. The market previously had only morning trade, and since the 5th, they have switched to trading all day, separated into morning and afternoon markets. The trading volume in the morning market was 1.3 thousand bales, while trading in the afternoon was more lively and active with a total of 40 bales. The whole day’s trading volume was roughly 6.7 thousand bales. The opening prices for double horse in the morning and afternoon markets are listed below:

Morning Market Afternoon Market

July Open 1,363 1,364 Closed 1,370 1,376

August Open 1,375 1,383 Closed 1,381 1,389

### Spot Cotton Situation is Stable

The situation for spot cotton remained roughly weak and finely uneven, and the situation was stable. Although factory demand was not strong, foreign cotton prices did not loosen, and the source was difficult, and handlers were generally in an extremely high spirits. A total of 700 bales and 200 packages of spot cotton were traded, and prices rose one to two yuan. The market is as follows:

Middling 439 Shenxin Factory sent 100 bales to the factory

Also 445 also 200 bales also

Fire Machine Flower 186 also 200 packages warehouse delivery

Middling 432 Home 100 bales also

Also 428 also 210 bales also

India NT 379 also 100 bales also

New York Cotton Market: The market situation was quiet and firm, rising due to poor weather reports and good cotton cloth trade. As a result, profits rose by 1 to 6 pounds sterling compared to the previous day.

Bombay Cotton Market: Initially, the market rose due to shorts covering, and then fell back due to brokers selling and longs taking profits. As a result, closing prices rose and fell from 0.5 to 2.5 rupees compared to the previous day. Opening forecasts for today show a fall of 0.25.

### Piece Goods Brisk Sales of Cloth Rising Sharply

Factory cloth: The market trend yesterday showed a slight improvement, due to the gradual increase in purchases by Hong Kong and Nanyang groups, coupled with loose money. Most of the inventory in the hands of fellow traders and speculators insisted on not releasing. Therefore, real sales of various brands were up very sharply. Plain cloth from Yihuo and other factories, light weight increased by five to seven and a half jiao per bolt. Military weight increased by two jiao and five fen, fine cloth and twill increased by two and a half to five jiao. Bleached and dyed cloth increased by about five jiao. Local street transactions for the current order flax yarn, printed cloth, foreign yarn and white canvas totalled over 300 pieces. New floral printed cloth from Luen Chang and Li Xin and other factories sold very well. Yuegang and Nanyang groups ordered over 400 pieces of dyed cloth, dyed twill and coarse cloth.

Eastern Cloth: The morning was flat, the afternoon rose, and the situation turned stronger. The opening price of white goods' Longtou fine cloth spot market was 44 yuan and 45 jiao. In the aftermarket, the warehouse receipts were exhausted, and the small investors were optimistic. It gradually rose to 45 yuan. At closing, the four gentlemen of dyed goods rose from 1 yuan, 4 jiao, 1 fen and 875 to 1 yuan and 4 jiao and 5 fen. At the close, it rebounded slightly to 1 yuan, 4 jiao, 3 fen and 7 li and a half.

### Sugar Market Bulls and Bears Fight Fearing Huge Changes Announcement of Market Suspension Association Discusses Proper Solution

Yesterday’s sugar market was initially flat, but later because the bulls urgently wanted to raise prices, they actually bought at 102 yuan. Although there was such a good price, the shorts did not dare to rashly respond, forming a contest between bulls and bears. The organizers, fearing that it would lead to huge changes, announced a market suspension. They held an emergency meeting in the afternoon to discuss a proper solution. The details are unknown. Generally, such a large number of ups and downs at the same time is also a "comedy" for both bulls and bears. The association divides the spot goods on the market: second and fourth grade coarse white outer warehouse, January old goods 90 yuan, February and March arrival 92 yuan, April arrival 93 yuan, without much difference. June 10th futures are 14 yuan, 3 yuan and a half, 3 yuan, June 20th futures are 94 yuan and a half, 5 yuan, 6 yuan, 5 yuan and a half, 4 yuan and a half, and 4 yuan. Dutch red spot goods remain 70 yuan. Taikoo Car White B Mark is 104 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 jiao, rising by half a yuan. HX Mark East Warehouse is 90 yuan, 5 jiao and 90 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon due to the meeting.

### Silk and Tea Black and Green Teas Both See Sales

Yesterday’s foreign company tea market saw slight movement. Xingcheng, Haoshimen and other companies purchased more than 400 boxes of black tea from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces at a price of 420 yuan, a slight increase of 7 or 8 yuan compared to before. Yihuo, Jinlong and other companies also bought more than 50 boxes of shrimp eye green tea at a selling price of 290 yuan to 300 yuan. The market trend is also firm. At present, the source of new tea from various routes is still blocked. It is said that 200 loads were transported from Zhoushan and Ningbo, and merchants felt very distressed.

### Seafood Dried Scallops and Qilin Vegetables Rise Together

Dried scallops have not been arriving recently, and various parties need them more actively, so the market situation suddenly turned tight. List prices have risen by several tens of yuan. Yesterday, medium grains opened up to 803 yuan, and broken grains also opened up to 660 yuan.

The supply and demand of squid are currently in balance, so the market is extremely stable. Yesterday's market selling price was 330 yuan, about 5 yuan better than before.

The existing inventory of Qilin vegetables is still thin. Yesterday, the market opened up a batch of West Lan vegetables, totaling 93 packages, priced at 94 yuan, up more than 10 yuan. The remaining Longya vegetables still sold for 73 to 74 yuan, and Wudun vegetables sold for 67 to 68 yuan. The market situation is tight.

### Miscellaneous Items Spray Paint Has a Market But No Goods

Spray paint raw materials are mainly gum sheets. In the past, local paint factories mostly relied on Hong Kong and Nanyang for supply. Transportation has been difficult after the war. Recently, various places have also controlled exports, resulting in a sudden interruption of supply. In the past month, market prices have soared, reaching several times higher. Currently, the price is about 7 yuan per pound, and there is still a market but no goods.

### Imports and Exports Goods Arrived From North and South Oceans

On the 4th, 1390 barrels of egg yolk and egg white and 130 pieces of tobacco industry were imported from Tianjin, 19 pieces of wild silk from Qingdao, 7 pieces of yellow silk from Yantai, and 200 pieces of iron and 910 packages of wax from Hong Kong.

### Coal Kailuan Coal Supply Abundant

Kailuan bituminous coal, after the holiday, sales are still lacking in improvement. Frequent sources of supply cause current inventories to be abundant, and it is inevitable that people will be weak. After all, the difference between Kailuan coal price and the black market prices is still too far apart, which is the only reason. Yesterday's open peer market price for two grade lump coal was 360 yuan per ton, and the two grade coke was 295 yuan. Warehouse delivery and porterage additional, 100 yuan less than the highest price in the previous month.

### Cacao and Chocolate Gao Jiannong

The flavor of cacao is so sweet and exquisite that the Swedish botanist Linne directly renamed its tree Cacaoyer as the "God's Food Tree!" This is due to the gratitude and appreciation of the mouth and stomach, but it is also based on the anecdotes that have been circulating in Mexico since ancient times. The anecdotes say: "The cacao tree originally grew in the 'Land of Happiness' where the first descendants of the sun god lived--a paradise of happiness, which is longed for by all people, whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, civilized or barbarian! There was a prophetic gardener named Quatzaleautl who brought its seeds to the world: this was originally the food enjoyed by the gods..." Therefore, since ancient times, Mexicans have worshiped and cherished the cacao tree, believing that the food it provides is the most delicious and superior, and possesses incredible effects.

The cacao tree is a tropical evergreen tree, seven to eight feet tall, with white, porous wood that is extremely light and brittle, and gray branches. The leaves are alternate, drooping, elliptical in shape, with pointed ends, shiny green, and very large. The flowers are small, five-petaled, red or yellow in color, and grow in clusters in the leaf axils, but more commonly, they grow solitary on the lower half of the old trunk or on thick branches. The fruit is a drooping drupe, commonly called Cabosse, five to six inches long, weighing from one hundred to five hundred grams, also elliptical in shape, with a pointed top, red-yellow in color, astringent skin, and ten longitudinal deep grooves. Each fruit contains about twenty-five to forty seeds--cacao--divided into five petals, embedded in a pink, gelatinous pulp. The ripe pulp is sour and delicious, and can be eaten raw, or it can be made into a beverage that scholars love. The cacao beans are seven to eight minutes long and half an inch wide. After roasting, they can be made into so-called cacao powder. According to the results of chemical analysis: cacao contains 50% butter, 11% protein, 4% minerals, 32% starch paste, cell membrane substance, etc. In short, cacao includes various components, is extremely rich in nitrogenous matter, and contains a great deal of nutrients in the smallest mass. It is really the best and most ideal food! Cortez, the Spaniard who conquered Mexico in 1520 AD, exaggerated the quality of cacao to the point of saying: "A person can walk all day by eating just a bowl of this precious melted beverage, and does not need to eat any other food!"

The ancient Mexicans' emphasis on cacao can also be seen from the fact that they used it as circulating currency. The units of currency included the so-called le countle, equal to two hundred cacao beans; le Xiquipal equal to eight thousand cacao beans; and le carga valued at twenty-four thousand cacao beans. For example, when Cortez conquered Mexico, a city called Tabasco, bordering the Gulf of Mexico, had to pay tribute to King Montezuma one thousand Xiquipal, which is sixteen million cacao beans, every year! And the booty that Cortez got was forty thousand bags! (To be continued)

### Groundnuts (Continued)

— Li Yuyong

The earliest cultivation in our country was along the southern coast. The Tingzhou Prefecture Gazetteer states, "Originates from the Western countries, commonly known as 'foreign beans'." The Zhangzhou Prefecture Gazetteer states, "Originates from the Western countries, previously nonexistent." The "Hui Shu" states, "This variety all comes from Fujian." At that time, the yield was very small, and the demand was not significant. Later, it spread to the central region, and people gradually learned to utilize it. In 1791, the Italian missionary Father Ma Xian Tuo Nei believed that the climate in China was suitable for peanuts, and considered the northern bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangxi Province to be the best location. Later, a British gentleman named Lord Amherst also made a statement that peanuts were suitable for China, which attracted the attention of Europeans. At the end of the 19th century, the demand for peanut oil in Guangdong exceeded supply, leading to the promotion of cultivation to the north. At that time, an American missionary from the Holy Path Church, Thompson (Audrdeacon Thompson), brought a gallon of large-pod peanuts to Shanghai. He met Dr. Charles R. Mills of the Presbyterian Church. Thompson gave half of the seeds to him. Dr. Mills went to Dengzhou, Shandong, and distributed the seeds to two fellow Christians to plant, instructing them to only use them for sowing within a year and not to consume them. Later, one of the fellow Christians disobeyed and ate all the peanuts he had planted. Fortunately, the second fellow Christian followed his instructions, and three years later, he distributed the harvested seeds to farmers to plant. Because the seeds were large, the farmers were happy to plant them.

According to the local custom, when pressing raw oil, the shells were not removed. When they first used large-pod peanuts to press oil, they failed because the pressed oil was absorbed by the thick shells. Everyone was very discouraged. Later, someone taught them to remove the shells, and the results were excellent. Shandong's peanuts therefore multiplied greatly and became a major export. It is said that there is still a stone monument in front of the Penglai County Government Office to commemorate the achievements of this introducer. (End)

### Six Christian Universities in East China Held Joint Graduation Ceremony Yesterday - Bishop Li Xuan De Encouraged Over 400 Graduates to Utilize Their Learned Skills and Develop Their Creative Abilities

Yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, the six Christian universities in East China, including Ginling Women's College, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Hangchow University, Soochow University, Shanghai Baptist College, and St. John's University, held a joint graduation ceremony at the Grand Theatre. Many guests, faculty, and students from various schools attended. There were a total of 436 university graduates. The American and Chinese flags, as well as the school flags of the six participating universities, were hung in the auditorium. Dozens of flower baskets were displayed in front of the stage, dazzling to the eye. The ceremony began on time. Guests, faculty from various schools, and graduates entered the hall in order to the sound of the U.S. Navy band. After everyone sang a hymn, Dr. Xia Fangji gave a prayer, followed by Dr. Li Pei'en, who expressed gratitude to the guests and encouraged the graduating students. Next, Bishop Li Xuan De delivered a speech in English, titled "The Creative Imagination," stating that the purpose of education is for teachers to understand the students' instinctive activities, guide them according to their aptitude, and allow them to develop freely along normal paths. It is absolutely impermissible to merely read books rigidly and bind their instinctive freedom of development. The progress of science throughout history has stemmed from having special ideals, creating experiments, and succeeding. Today, university graduates should continue to study in their respective fields, put their knowledge into practice in the world, not betray what they have learned, and have a spirit of creation. Next, Zhou Chengen, the principal of the Soochow University Affiliated High School, reported that 119 graduates from the high school, including Zhu Shishi, etc., were issued certificates by Dr. Wen Naishi, the acting president of the school. Next, Li Haoshan, the head of the Shanghai Baptist College Affiliated High School, reported that 67 graduates from the high school, including Zhang Qingxiang, etc., were issued certificates by Fan Zhengkang, the president of the school. Subsequently, the administrative authorities of the six universities, Ginling Women's College, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Hangchow University, Soochow University, Shanghai Baptist College, and St. John's University, successively awarded degrees to the graduates of each school. Afterwards, President Fan Zhengkang delivered a speech on behalf of the six universities to the graduates, saying that they had persevered during the national crisis, and it was fortunate that they were able to graduate. The existence of Christian schools has its own true spirit, making people believe, and the reputation of the school can be maintained. Although you are leaving your alma mater, you must still uphold the spirit of Christ's universal love, helping people, enduring hardship, and working hard to serve and bring honor to your alma mater. Then, the list of award-winning students from each school was read out, and the meeting adjourned.

### Visiting the Joint Graduation Ceremony of Six Universities in East China

— Zhao Erqian

In the dim morning light with the threat of rain, countless young people, dressed in graduation gowns, gathered at the YMCA on Nanjing Road, and then marched in formation towards the Grand Theatre. In the procession were men and women, young and old, Chinese and foreigners, all assembled together. Some were silver-haired and youthful, others were handsome youths. Their attire was different from the ordinary, possessing a medieval mystical air, proceeding solemnly. Thus, they aroused the curious gazes of the citizens. Unexpectedly, in the central district, the heart of commerce, the elite of Shanghai's highest institutions of learning were discovered. This was the beginning of the graduation ceremony of the Six Universities in East China.

Upon arriving at the Grand Theatre, the degree-awarding ceremony immediately commenced. First, Doctor Xia Fangji gave a prayer. In his prayer, everyone heard him pleading in a solemn and pious tone for the happiness, unity, cooperation, and prosperity of China. Every word struck the hearts of everyone present. Next, Dr. Li Pei'en gave a speech, followed by Mr. Fan Zhengkang's exhortation. But the most moving of all was Doctor Li Xuande's speech. In the manner of an orator, he explained the importance of religious and moral education. University students who have received the highest education should shoulder their responsibilities and create a new world. Students are a force, a factor in stabilizing this tumultuous world.

Yesterday, there were many guests, mostly relatives and friends of the students. They welcomed the graduates into the hall with smiles, expressing their boundless joy. The hundreds of graduating young people also beamed with smiles, advancing with a spirit of courage, moving slowly as if they were brides on a church floor, the wedding day carpet presenting a stumbling block with every step.

The graduation ceremony was held in an atmosphere of pomp. Each program was photographed, but because the interior of the Grand Theatre was dark, photography was difficult, resulting in flashes of light, reminiscent of Hitler's blitzkrieg, dazzling the eyes. However, we hope that the photographs will be successful, leaving a memento for the graduates of the Six Universities in East China.

Guan Zhong once said, "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people." Education is not an easy task, and education during wartime is especially difficult to sustain. However, in the fourth year of the Sino-Japanese War, the Six Universities in East China still had four hundred university graduates, which is truly a contribution to the nation. We further hope that the "four hundred Arhats" will strive, as Doctor Xuande said, to shoulder their responsibilities and create a new China.

All parties unanimously praised the initiative. The cup competition was held publicly for five times, with the number of spectators reaching several thousand. In particular, the association, with its team of talent, defeated the Jewish team, the Western Union Russian-Jewish Allied Forces in exhibition matches, fulfilling the mission of two great victories and earning unparalleled glory for the Chinese people.

Commentary

### On "Salary Increase"

— Xu Daming

Rising prices are followed by salary increase requests from the salaried class. If both sides are stuck in their stubborn preconceptions, then labor strikes and other disputes will result. This has become common knowledge today.

A few days ago (the 3rd), we saw news in various newspapers that the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) was going to increase salaries. We should congratulate the SMC employees and consider the SMC, which holds the administrative hub of the International Settlement, to be acting wisely. But we hope that the SMC can implement fundamental "surgery" on suppressing prices, and we also hope that the SMC's salary increase will pay attention to the following most important point:

That is, whether the method of uniformly increasing salaries by a certain percentage is reasonable is questionable.

Here, let's first talk about the advantages and disadvantages of this percentage increase:

On the advantage side, it is only for the convenience of settlement. We cannot find more sufficient reasons.

But on the disadvantage side, it creates the following results: those with high salaries receive even more, and the gap between the small and the large becomes even greater. But today, the stomachs that need to be fed are the same size for the entire society, no, the entire human race. Moreover, the poorer people are, the less they can afford to eat.

For example, a person earning a monthly salary of two thousand yuan (there are not few people in the SMC earning this much). Adding the original 150% allowance, they already have five thousand. Now, if they add another 40%, wouldn't it quickly become six thousand? No matter what, these friends cannot use that much money, so they use the remaining money for unnecessary consumption, which in turn helps create the abnormality in today's society and the ever-increasing cost of living for the poor. And the SMC's salary increase will never stop. We think this is not a reasonable salary increase method.

Therefore, we believe that, on the one hand, the demand for a reasonable standard of living should be considered for the majority of people, and on the other hand, the following methods may be adopted:

1. Regardless of the size of the salary, a uniform amount is added.

2. A certain amount is added for those below fifty, a certain amount is added for those below one hundred, and so on for two hundred and three hundred.

3. Or, increase rice allowances, like the SMC's current method, regardless of the size of the salary, because eating is the same, which is a reasonable method.

We are willing to sincerely provide the above three methods to the SMC as a reference for salary increase research, because in addition to the Customs and Post Office, companies such as electricity, telephone, and tram companies are also implementing them very well. Moreover, this can not only reduce the SMC's expenditures, but also be beneficial to social regulation.

Finally, we believe that since the salary increase of the SMC is called a "temporary living allowance," then it should meet the minimum reasonable condition of enabling people to "live"!

At the same time, we also hope that other agencies, schools, shops, or libraries, etc., should learn from the SMC!

### Sooner or Later

— Yin Gu

Western Suit A: "Damn, just one minute short! It would have been great to have skipped one less round. 'Blood-Soaked Rivers and Mountains' must have started!" (Disheartened)
Western Suit B (Cheerfully coming out): "Brother, it's alright, they're just showing lantern slides for advertisements..."

Dancer A (Jumping out of a car): "What! The 11 o'clock Hula Dance... Damn it, why is my money so slow... Damn it!"
Dancer B: "Ha, you're really too eager to 'see'! You haven't even entered the door, how do you know... The Hula Dance hasn't even started yet, you're really overreacting."

(A claps his hands and laughs loudly, repeatedly: Psychological effect, mind...)

Diner (In a rickshaw): "Ah! The cold appetizers are probably finished, oh, and that shark fin soup... (Hastily enters the auditorium.)"

Receptionist: "Oh, Mr. So-and-so, you're just in time, quickly go and greet them."

(Turns out the officiant is just giving his speech.

He himself doesn't find it funny, but inwardly he's overjoyed, finally getting to eat the 'Full Family Fortune' dish).

Tenant: "What the heck, the lights are off, and we haven't even finished three rounds of cards..."

(A "pung" card is slammed down.)

Landlord (Loudly): "Go look at the clock, it's exactly twelve o'clock! Twelve o'clock, lights off, that's the rule!"
(Tenant hurriedly lights a candle to look, it's still one minute to twelve, wants to argue, but then it is exactly twelve o'clock.)

Mother: "Hey kid, run faster, the cheap rice (It's probably not called that anymore, but the poor still call it that!) will be sold out... Running is just using your legs anyway, we can't afford to be hungry..."

Son (Panting): "Mom, I ran all the way from Caojia Ferry, I can't even walk anymore, and I still have to run..."
(By the time they arrive, the rice shop hasn't even opened yet, but a long line of hungry people is already forming. Are they still late?)

Hostess: "Sir, you said two hours... I'm sorry, it's up!" (She acts coy.)

Client (Reluctantly): "Why are you so mindful of the time?" (The woman is despondent.)

This is in a certain room in a large hotel.

Unemployed Man (Reading the newspaper): "...No lodging provided, monthly salary eight yuan... Must be able to endure hardship, have a reliable guarantor... At × pm on × day, come to this office in person to negotiate..."

The wall clock in the so-called "office": "1:10 PM." (The doorway is already extremely crowded.)

This "unemployed man" is sweating profusely, clutching a streetcar ticket worth × angle × fen in his hand.

### A Knight's Act of Justice — A Street Scene

— Zhi Da

I was strolling on the street. By chance, over there, I saw a Chinese and a Western woman chatting naturally, just coming out of a dim sum shop, each holding a bag of delicious pastries. They had just stepped into the street when a beggar followed them from behind, suddenly snatching the bag of delicious pastries from the Chinese woman's hand with his filthy hand. Logically, he should have quickly run away, but I don't know if it was because he had experience and didn't need to run fast, or because he was old and couldn't run fast, or because he was too weak from hunger to run fast? In any case, he wasn't running fast.

As for that fashionable young lady, perhaps to maintain her elegant figure, or perhaps because of the large amount of food, she didn't chase or get angry, but just gave a faint, captivating smile.

But the story didn't end there. Suddenly, a knight appeared from the side, a foreign knight. He was very alert, and swiftly and easily caught the offender. The beggar naturally suffered a beating, and naturally didn't resist. Unfortunately, the bag of delicious pastries was scattered all over the ground, and the knight stepped on them to express his inner anger.

Naturally, every passerby stopped to watch. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to observe the expressions of all the onlookers before getting on a bus. Even if I stuck my head out, I couldn't see clearly. The bus certainly wouldn't stop just for me to watch. I only heard a "heh-heh" laugh from a passenger behind me, and I couldn't guess what the "flavor" of the laugh was.

I closed my eyes on the bus.

### There Will Be This Day

— Chang Yan Dao Zhi

### Summer

— Jue Hui

Many people have been looking forward to the arrival of summer, and their necks have been stretched for twelve months!

They say: "There are four seasons in a year: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Only summer can show off its glory!"

The Beginning of Summer, the Dragon Boat Festival, salted duck eggs and zongzi have all been eaten. Who would stubbornly insist that it's still winter? So, summer has arrived!

Summer has arrived. A thousand words, where to begin? "We" gentlemen focus on the essential, and consider showing off to be paramount, to be the most important thing.

The 20th century is an era of "civilization," and barbarous habits should be swept away. Therefore, showing off is not about murder and arson, but about "displaying."

From white leather shoes to white teeth, from the instep to the hair, that's a "gentleman." Bare necks, exposed arms, bare feet, bare legs... that's a "lady." One is "graceful," one is "desirable." Thus, everywhere they go, they "display"; everywhere they walk, they "show off." National affairs can be "damned," but showing off is a must!

There are many places to "go" in the summer: besides dance halls and theaters, swimming pools and ice parlors are all excellent "summer resorts." And, I heard that your eyes can also eat "ice cream"...

Truly, great is my summer, beautiful is my summer, leisurely and carefree.

If someone rudely interrupts and says, "The 'bedbugs' in summer are annoying!" then you must be a complete fool. Because the words "bedbugs" have never existed in the minds of "gentlemen and ladies"!

Since that's the case, there's no need to say anything more. But when it comes to writing about summer, it's easy to write an essay like a primary school student: "Spring has gone, summer has come, the weather is very hot..." and write "freely and unrestrainedly" for hundreds of thousands of words. But I think it's enough to stop here, isn't it?

### Begonia

— Qin Shou Ou

(9) A Strange Farmer

Time waits for no one. In the blink of an eye, three years have passed unnoticed. But in this almost completely isolated Li Village, nothing has changed: three years ago, the fields were planted with wheat, sorghum, and cotton; now they are still the same. Three years ago, the village had only forty or fifty households, and now it still maintains this record, not one more, not one less. The old ox goes to the fields with its master every day, and the tired, skinny mule drags the heavy cart back and forth on the small road. Simply nothing has changed.

If one must say that there have been some changes, then the first would be Wu San.

Three years ago, on a late autumn evening, when the sunlight was less than half swallowed by darkness, the doors of almost every household in the village were closed. In the grayish-yellow fields, only the figures of a few naughty children were floating. Suddenly, a mule cart drove from the east and quietly stopped in front of the newly built large tile house of Old Master Wu's family. Then, several people got off the cart and were led into the house by Old Master Wu. Finally, two or three able-bodied men from the Wu family carried many things from the cart, including boxes, trunks, and silk baskets, very much as if relatives of the Wu family had come specifically to rely on them.

The next morning, Old Master Wu carried a dry tobacco pipe and personally invited a dozen or twenty elderly people to his house for a drink, saying that his nephew, Lao San, had lost his wife in Tianjin and there was no one to take care of his three-year-old daughter, so he had simply moved back there to live.

Everyone went to his house to take a look, and his nephew was still just a young man in his mid-twenties, wearing a neat long gown, looking very much like a businessman. He was also very friendly, respectfully calling these old men "old uncles" and "old grandfathers." But there was one very strange thing, and that was the large piece of white cloth wrapped around his face! (215)

Entertainment World

### Recent Developments in Shanghai's Spoken Drama Scene

— Xi Di

This year is the "Spoken Drama Year."

Here, we would like to report to the readers of the Entertainment World on the latest developments in the Shanghai spoken drama scene. The spoken drama groups that are emerging today can be roughly divided into two categories: "professional" and "amateur." The "professional" theater troupes that exist now are the "Shanghai Drama Art Society," "China Travel," "Tianfeng," and the "Huazheng," which was recently formed by outstanding actors from the film industry. The "Shanghai Drama Art Society" relied on the box office success of "Family" to gain a foothold, and is now staging Wu Zuguang's "Song of Righteousness." This is a great historical drama in ancient costume, which narrates the moving historical facts of Wen Tianxiang's loyalty and love for his country, directed by Wu Jiangfan. The cast is quite strong. Film stars such as Zhou Qi, Lan Lan, and Han Fei have all joined as guest actors, and Shi Hui's role as Wen Tianxiang, like Liu Qiong's role as Zheng Chenggong in the past, is full of enthusiasm and deeply moving, leaving the audience with lingering aftertastes after leaving the theater. This type of spoken drama is truly worthy of recommendation.

"China Travel" is currently performing "Hong Xuanjiao," which is similar in nature to "Song of Righteousness." This drama was first performed at the Lyceum. It won social praise, and is now being staged continuously at the Carlton Theater, with undiminished box office success. The playwright is Wei Ruhui, the director is Fei Mu, and the costume designer is Hu Xuguang. It is said that the Micheng Film Company has decided to bring "Hong Xuanjiao" to the screen, and has invited the original cast, including Tang Ruoqing and others, to take on the roles, with a contract value breaking the film industry's historical record, which can be described as extremely generous. "Tianfeng" seems to be finding its way in modern dramas. It is currently performing "Grace and Revenge" at the Xuan Palace. This drama was originally named "Chronicle of Blood-Soaked Rouge," written by Yu Ling and adapted by Wu Chen, and directed by Luo Peng. "Huazheng" has performed several one-act plays in the past, but unfortunately, none of them have achieved good results. They have decided to make persistent efforts and stage Jiang Shangqing's "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" at the Lyceum. This is a story about Yue Fei. The cast has been properly arranged and includes Wang Xianzai as Qin Hui, Huang He as Yue Fei, Chen Qi as Yinping's mother, and Zhou Qi as Niu Gao (details omitted). They are preparing to start performing on the 20th, and are actively rehearsing at the Micheng Factory these days.

There are countless "amateur" theater troupes, such as "Zhengfeng," hosted by You Guangzhao and Tian Zhendong, "Hongying," led by Cai Bingbai and Cao Zhenzhong, and others such as "Weiwei," "Yilin," and many theater troupes organized by major middle schools, the Silver Industry, the Chinese United Club, and others. "Zhengfeng" has too few talents. You Guangzhao wears an Indian silk gown every night, sweating in his small living room, leaning back on his hands, pacing back and forth, reciting his lines, explaining to the members, and gesturing as he does so. His spirit is admirable! "Hongying" appears in the form of opera and now has more than sixty male and female members, most of whom are from academia. They are all very capable in their work. They performed "The Flower Girl" in the past and received good reviews. The play was written and directed by Cai Bingbai and composed by Zhang Hao. They may perform it again at the Grand Shanghai Theater recently. In September, they will also perform a mythological drama like "The Wizard of Oz." The plot is very interesting and the meaning is absolutely serious. It will still be written and directed by Cai Bingbai. Mr. Cai is well-versed in opera. "The Shanghai Song" made a splash. This mythological drama is his second shot, and it is expected that the results will be extraordinary. Opera fans should wait and see.

Having written this far, I should draw a conclusion. I think: The rise of spoken drama troupes is certainly a good phenomenon, but everyone must stand on their own positions. It is wrong and unacceptable to only aim at "making money" and treating it as a "pastime." We must remember the mission that this difficult era has given to playwrights. What is it?

### Saying Goodbye, Hearing Hui Sheng

— Tai Wu Jushi

"Selling Horses": Full Performance Tomorrow Night

Since Xun Huisheng's second appearance in the Golden Hall, his term is about to expire. A few days ago, due to a cold, he insisted on performing on stage, resulting in several excellent plays that could not be premiered in advance. Now that Huisheng's cold has healed, and because his departure is imminent, he is pre-announcing that the new plays will be successively contributed to those who love to watch Xun's plays. For example, tonight's complete "Red Phoenix Wedding" and "Fan Jiang Pass," two double acts, are also rare and famous dramas in the Xun style. Tomorrow night (Saturday) will be the full performance of "Selling Horses," starting with Li Qi selling horses to other families, Yang Huatian committing adultery with Wang Tong, Guizhi protecting Tong being driven away, committing suicide and being rescued, Chunhua hanging herself, Hu Jing accepting bribes, Li Qi being falsely accused, creating a wrongful imprisonment, Guizhi marrying Zhao Chong, Tong becoming a circuit censor, and then continuing with Li Qi crying in prison, Guizhi writing a complaint, the three reuniting, and ending with Tian Wang and Yang Hua being executed. The tragic family changes caused by selling horses will be performed one by one, which is much more exciting than the usual single performance of half the play. Hui Niu plays Guizhi from beginning to end, Xu Hecai plays Zhao Chong, He Wenqian cross-dresses as Bao Tong, Li Wenxi plays Chunhua, Chen Xixing plays Li Qi, Zhu Binxian plays Yang Sanchun, Wang Duoshou plays Tian Wang, Cao Lianxiao plays Liu Zhishan, Li Yishou plays Hu Jing, and Luo Xiaokui plays Jinzi. The entire play is first Peking opera and then Kunqu opera, and it takes four hours to perform. This play has been out of the singing world for more than twenty years. Huisheng obtained it from Wang Yaoqing, and Yaoqing obtained it when he was serving in the inner court in those years, so its value is evident. In the Liyuan circle, there are very few people who can perform this play other than Huisheng.

### The Art of Watching Movies

— Wen Xun

(1) When choosing the film you want to watch, you should base your decision on the director's past achievements and reputation, and never on the star of the film, otherwise you will definitely be fooled.

(2) You must not have a fixed idea that this film is good, or you will often be disappointed.

(3) You must not have an attitude of absolute appreciation of art, or you will lose the value of recreation.

(4) You don't need to watch too many films of a similar nature, or you will easily get bored.

(5) It is best to watch fewer films with upper and lower episodes, otherwise you will easily suffer losses. (Because good films do not necessarily have upper and lower episodes.)

(6) Do not sit next to a smoking moviegoer (if you yourself do not like to smoke), otherwise the smell of his smoke will distract your mind from watching the show and make you uncomfortable.

(7) Do not sit in a seat behind a couple, because your line of sight will often be blocked by their heads, and your neck may be sore after the show.

(8) When you see something interesting, do not laugh too loudly, or you will be resented by others.

(9) When you see something sad, do not shed too many tears, or it is not worth it, and your tearful traces will be laughed at after the show.

(10) If you decide to watch a certain film, do not ask those who have already seen it, and do not listen to them telling you about the "gimmicks" of the film, otherwise you will not feel interested when you go to see it yourself.

Chapter 10: Gongsun's Sword Qi is Initially Displayed

Liu Yinying said up to this point, Wang Yongtai nodded and said, "Just now, this old man was sitting in meditation, not yet asleep. My eyes were closed, and my thoughts were disturbed. I didn't know the reason, but suddenly I heard a sound outside the window. My heart moved, and I immediately took my dagger and jumped out of the room. I saw a person knocked down on the ground, and opposite him was standing this Mr. Liu. I didn't know the truth, so I asked Mr. Liu. Who knew that Mr. Liu didn't know this person either. He told me that he had come here with a friend, and just happened to see this person looking like an assassin, so he fired a dart and knocked him down. So I thanked Mr. Liu for his help, but I didn't ask his name, and first questioned the assassin on the ground." Xu Jing said, "Strange, Uncle has always treated people very well, without resentment or enmity. Where did the assassin come from?" Wang Yongtai said, "The assassin confessed honestly that he was sent by the rebel Li Zicheng. After Li Zicheng left Tongguan, he was advancing into Jin Province. He heard that General Zhou Yuji was preparing his troops here, ready to attack head-on. Daizhou was not easy to take suddenly, so Li Zicheng listened to the conspiracy of his military advisor and specially sent three warriors to Daizhou to assassinate General Zhou and this old man. Heaven helped this old man to avoid being assassinated, and it was not without Mr. Liu's help." Xu Jing was shocked when he heard this and said, "The assassin was sent by Li Chuang? Then where are the other two?" Wang Yongtai said, "The assassin said that there were two others who had gone to General Zhou's camp to assassinate him." Xu Jing said, "How is General Zhou? This is also worrying." Wang Yongtai said, "This old man just heard this news and has already sent servants to General Zhou's office to inquire. But I know that General Zhou has been very vigilant recently, with guards all around him. The rebels will never succeed." Xu Jing said, "I hope so. Where is the assassin now?" Wang Yongtai said, "I have already tied up that fellow and handed him over to the servants to guard, and I will take him to General Zhou's office tomorrow to question him." Xu Jing also asked, "Brother Liu and Uncle are not acquainted with each other. How did you talk to each other?" Liu Yin said, "Just because when we were questioning the assassin, the assassin confessed the name of Old Hero Wang. This younger brother has long admired Jingzhou, so I paid my respects to Old Hero Wang. Old Hero Wang asked me why I came here, and this younger brother told the truth. Old Hero Wang was very surprised and told me that Jing Brother was his nephew and left here in a fit of anger. He heard me say that you had been here, so he went to the upstairs behind to see what was going on and told this younger brother to wait here." (82)
