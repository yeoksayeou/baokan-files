### With Three and a Half Divisions, Japan Invades Henan: Suffers Crushing Defeat, Its Momentum Exhausted; Chinese Forces Press Directly on Xinyang, Japanese Troops Retreat South; Japanese Remnants West of Tongbai on the Pinghan Line Captured by Chinese Forces

Chongqing – General Bai Chongxi, Deputy Chief of Staff, reported today on the details of the recent battle in southern Henan, stating that in the past two weeks, the Japanese army's offensive in Henan and Hubei provinces has focused its main attack on Henan, with only minor battles seen in Hubei. Before the offensive in Henan, the Japanese forces stationed there included the 18th Independent Brigade, the 39th Division, the 4th Division, the 3rd Division, the 14th Independent Brigade, and other troops, totaling three and a half divisions, including 80,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, 550 field guns, 500 tanks, and 200 armored vehicles. In mid-January, the Japanese launched an offensive on the west bank of the Han River, aiming to lure Chinese forces into the area. By January 24, the main Japanese force launched an offensive in southern Henan. Last December, the Japanese secretly transferred the 17th and 15th Divisions to southern Henan and northern Hubei, while a portion of the 40th Division moved from southern Henan to Xinyang, where 30,000 Japanese troops were concentrated in mid-January.

Chongqing – The Ta Kung Pao recently published an editorial on the matter of promoting wartime bonds, calling on the people of the country to arouse their patriotism, economize all their financial resources, and purchase national bonds, and offering two suggestions to the government: (1) Exchange bonds for escaped overseas capital.

If negotiations are made with Britain and the United States to extradite the deposits, it can definitely be done, and bond certificates can be given to the depositors. (2) Adopt a system of allocation. It is said that allocating bonds has become a necessary step for the current financial situation. It not only raises funds but also suppresses prices and curbs inflation.

Editorial

### Analysis of the World Situation

With the passage of the American "Lend-Lease Act" in the House of Representatives, the Senate will surely pass it smoothly as well. From this point on, the international situation will undergo major developments, which everyone is currently holding their breath to expect.

Analyzing the international situation: Strictly speaking, from a diplomatic perspective, the formal announcement of the Tripartite Pact by Germany, Italy, and Japan last September fundamentally blocked their diplomatic initiative and maneuverability in one fell swoop. As a result, the three countries were left with only military and strategic initiative. According to this pact, although they have the freedom to take any actions they deem necessary and can attack in any direction, after exposing the faces of the "New Order" builders, what diplomatic maneuverability do they have with any other country outside the three countries? Only demanding or coercing recognition of their "New Order." Beyond that, there is no more diplomacy. Over the past four months, the various diplomatic activities of Germany and Italy in Europe, as well as Japan's various postures toward Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, have all been focused on obtaining recognition or understanding from other countries regarding the "New Order." In the past, present, and future, these will certainly have no effect. Because their fundamental basis is pure violence, what is most noteworthy is how they will ultimately use their offensive and which target they will apply violence to first. When Japan invaded Vietnam, what everyone expected was not a northward advance to attack Yunnan and Guangxi in China, but the implementation of the so-called "Southern Advance." When Germany invaded Romania, Italy attacked Greece, and simultaneously used troops in Africa, what everyone was worried about first was the fate of the Balkan countries and Turkey, and secondly, Britain's defense in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, in Africa, and in the Middle East and Near East.

If the three countries' offensives could truly succeed, then countries like China, Britain, and the United States, which oppose the "New Order," would have to remain in a defensive position, each striving to individually resist the advance of the three countries. However, in reality, this is not the case. This is because at the same time that Italy has suffered major setbacks in both Europe and Africa, Japan in Asia has also fallen into a predicament where both northward and southward advances are impossible due to the unexpectedly strong stance of the United States. Under this situation, China, Britain, and the United States are given a great opportunity to change from a defensive military posture to an offensive one, from being passive to actively seeking the initiative. The American "Lend-Lease Act" is the prelude to this move, and Britain's recent large-scale attacks on Italy are already the beginning of the offensive.

The various aspects of the American government and public opinion regarding the "Lend-Lease Act" have been clarified very clearly. Its greatest significance is to thoroughly defeat Germany, Italy, and Japan. British Prime Minister Churchill's speech the day before yesterday also stated a plan to defeat Italy first and then defeat Germany to achieve final victory. The Chinese authorities recently emphasized their determination to counterattack when contacting the United States for assistance. Therefore, looking at it from this perspective, the most core content of the various measures taken by China, Britain, and the United States in the future is to concentrate on working together to defeat Germany, Italy, and Japan separately. As for Germany, Italy, and Japan, if they do not abandon the so-called "New Order," then all their current measures must be centered on two of the most urgent tasks: (1) how to prevent the actual effect of American assistance to various democratic countries; (2) how to save Italy from its impending doom. These two aspects constitute the main trend of the evolution of the entire international situation at present and in the near future.

Regarding cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States, after the passage of the "Lend-Lease Act," the United States will first import a large number of aircraft into the British Isles, allowing Britain, in addition to attacking Italy, to have sufficient aircraft to defend its own skies and protect the fleet preventing the German army from crossing the sea. Once the British air force balances with or even exceeds the German air force, Germany will lose the advantage of the only weapon it relies on to invade the British Isles, and the battle situation in Britain itself can be absolutely stabilized. As for China, once it possesses a large number of aircraft, one of the most important conditions for a large-scale counterattack will have been completed. In terms of the navy, the American two-ocean fleet program will of course be actively accelerated. Once its Pacific Fleet is fully concentrated in various bases and cooperates with the British fleet in the South Pacific, the Japanese fleet will fall into a solid encirclement. Not only will it be impossible to assist Germany and Italy in their operations in Europe and Africa, and the southern advance will be impossible, but even protecting its own overseas commercial expansion will be completely impossible. As for the Italian fleet, it can now avoid fighting the British fleet and temporarily gain a respite. At that time, after the United States adds a large number of warships to the British fleet, the Italian navy will have to risk a battle in an attempt to break through the encirclement, but this is bound to fail. After Britain and the United States completely control the sea, Germany, Italy, and Japan will fall into an unprecedented blockade, and then be forced to surrender and await the final collapse. This so-called collapse does not necessarily require suffering a counterattack, but the momentum of the counterattack by China and Britain with new forces at that time will certainly be unstoppable by the three countries.

Looking again at Germany, Italy, and Japan preventing American aid to various democratic countries, the various intimidation and sabotage activities they have done during these times have been declared a complete failure in principle by the passage of this "Lend-Lease Act." In the future, they can only rely on actual actions: how to make it impossible for China and Britain to receive aid, and how to make it impossible for the United States to automatically go to the aid of various countries. The only way to take this action is to preemptively defeat the various invaded countries, so that they are defeated before they can receive American aid; otherwise, the only way is to directly attack the United States. In addition, how to save Italy from its impending doom should also be considered a top priority by Germany and Japan. Estimating all possible routes, it is impossible for the German army to go through Bulgaria in the Balkan Peninsula to support Italy and disturb the Mediterranean because of the resolute attitudes of the Soviet Union and Turkey. The only remaining method is to go through Yugoslavia, or for the German air force to provide air support to Italy. This is now being intensified, but as a result, it has also dispersed the strength of the attack on Britain. The result of this will not affect the total combat power of both sides, but if the joint German and Italian air force can weaken British hegemony in the Mediterranean, then perhaps they can attempt to send the German army to Africa to assist Italy in its operations. However, the most effective third way to save Italy is for Germany to directly attack Britain, or for Japan to attack British territories in the East, diverting Britain's strength and attention.

However, looking at the recent international situation, even in terms of military initiative, it is being transferred to the hands of countries such as China, Britain, and the United States day by day. Therefore, in the near future, if Germany, Italy, and Japan cannot make any amazing moves, then they will fall into losing all initiative and all hope of winning.

### Amidst Changing Mediterranean Warfare, Franco and Foreign Minister Suddenly Visit Mussolini; Purpose of Trip Sparks Speculation, Mediation of Anglo-Italian War Rife

Vichy – According to sources here, General Franco has entered French territory and will transfer to Italy to meet with Mussolini. (Haitong dispatch, 11th)

Vichy – Confirmed reports state that Spanish leader General Franco and Spanish Foreign Minister Sunar passed through French territory today. It is expected that they will travel to Italy to discuss matters with Mussolini or Hitler. It is also reported that on their return trip, they will meet with Marshal Petain in the Riviera on Thursday. Petain left for the Riviera by special train today. (Associated Press, 11th)

Vichy – The visit of Spanish dictator Franco, who passed through French territory yesterday on his way to Rome, has sparked rumors that Spain will mediate the Anglo-Italian conflict. Informed sources here predict that Marshal Petain, the French Prime Minister who once served as the French Ambassador to Spain, has maintained close contact with Franco recently. In the near future, if the Anglo-Italian conflict is mediated, Petain may suggest an important step. Diplomatic circles here say that although the Italian army was defeated in Libya, the Italian press maintains a "strange silence," which is quite puzzling. The influence of the United States has also been speculated by diplomatic circles. It is pointed out that the United States recently agreed to provide food relief to starving Spanish people. In return, Franco may attempt to mediate. Observers here say that President Roosevelt has repeatedly asked Mussolini through diplomats and special envoys to extricate Italy from the quagmire of war. The US government recently received secret reports that there is unrest everywhere in Italy, and in the near future, "events may occur." (International News Service, 11th)

### Greek Army Uses Long-Range Artillery to Bombard Italian Positions; Italian Counterattacks Fail Six Times; Famous Greek Ancient Church Destroyed in Air Raid

London – The main target of the Greek army in central Albania in the future is Erse. The Greek artillery fire was fierce, and finally failed, abandoning many dead and wounded Italian soldiers.

### Dismissal of the Romanian Minister to Greece

Rome: The Italian official news agency, Agenzia Stefani, reports that the Romanian Minister to Greece, Mr. Davila, has been dismissed from his post. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

New York: A Columbia Broadcasting System correspondent stationed in Vichy claims that General Franco is currently traveling to the Italian Riviera to meet with the Italian government leader, and that the reason for the meeting appears to be to discuss ways to withdraw Italian troops in North Africa to Spain. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

New York: According to news from Vichy, General Franco is currently en route to Rome, leading to rumors that Mr. Franco may be mediating the Anglo-Italian war. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

New York: A "New York Times" correspondent stationed in Vichy reports that, according to reliable sources in Vichy, there is a possibility that Spanish General Franco will meet with Mussolini in Italy, and that Hitler will also have an opportunity to participate. It is reported that General Petain is currently at his villa near Cannes, taking a few days of rest. The newspaper points out that General Petain served as ambassador to Spain and is highly respected by Mr. Franco, leading to speculation that Mr. Franco may be acting as a mediator, and that some negotiations have begun between England and Italy. According to previous news from Vichy, Mr. Franco had set off for Rome, leading to rumors that he might be acting as an intermediary to mediate between England and Italy. Another report from Rome stated that Mr. Franco had arrived in San Remo. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

Vichy: It is widely rumored here that Spanish Head of State General Franco has received an invitation from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to meet in a certain location in Italy. At that time, Mr. Franco also plans to lead Foreign Minister Serrano Suñer to travel through France. Foreign Minister Suñer will also come here to visit the French authorities. According to observations from diplomatic circles here, this news has not yet been confirmed. If it does materialize, it is likely due to the chaotic situation in the Mediterranean. The development of the war situation in Italian Libya in North Africa has directly affected the Mediterranean situation. Since Spain and Italy are two major peninsulas extending into the Mediterranean, their respective authorities must have the need for long-term planning. It is reported that since Foreign Minister Suñer's visit to Berlin and Rome at the end of last year, Spain's position has not changed. (Tenth Havas dispatch)

Pessani: The Albanian front lines of the Italian army, especially the transportation lines between Elbasan and the front, as well as between Berat and Moscopole, have been attacked by the Greek army with considerable success.

(Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

London: The Italian army launched four counter-attacks in Albania in the past 24 hours, all of which were repelled.

### Balkan Situation Worsens After Britain Announces Severance of Relations with Romania German Troops Concentrate on Hungarian-Romanian Border Awaiting Orders Formal Declaration of War Between Britain and Romania Possible

London: As Britain severed relations with Romania, the world's attention yesterday focused on the Balkans, as it may be the location where the next war will break out. It is reported that Romania's neighbors are now fervently preparing for war, as it is widely believed that such a war is very possible as a result of British diplomatic actions. News reports state that convoys of armored vehicles carrying thousands of German troops in plain clothes are passing through Romania en route to Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. It is also reported that 500,000 German troops are concentrating on the Hungarian border, preparing to enter Romania. Within Romania, large-scale military operations are reportedly underway after Prime Minister Antonescu ordered the implementation of the first national blackout yesterday. (Eleventh International News Service dispatch)

London: Since the severance of Anglo-Romanian diplomatic relations, authoritative sources here today are maintaining silence regarding the actions that Britain will take against Romania. However, the official British news agency stated today that if Germany uses Romanian oil fields to invade England, it will immediately trigger bombing by British aircraft. Therefore, Balkan diplomatic circles believe that Britain's second step may be to bomb the Ploiești oil fields in Romania without provocation. (Eleventh International News Service dispatch)

London: Observers today believe that the severance of Anglo-Romanian diplomatic relations, following British Prime Minister Churchill's stern warning to Bulgaria, indicates that the Balkan situation may soon erupt. Balkan diplomats say that if Romania soon goes to war with Britain and Bulgaria colludes with Germany to join Romania in fighting against Britain, it is entirely within their expectations. They believe that if Britain bombs Romanian oil fields, it will be followed by a formal declaration of war. There is no sign of such a situation being imminent, but given Britain's statement that Romania is being used by Germany as a basis for military plans, this matter is difficult to ignore. It was recently rumored that Germany has established a large military base in the Dobruja province of Bulgaria, including the storage of large quantities of munitions. It is widely believed that British Prime Minister Churchill's warning to Bulgaria was prompted by this direct factor. British Prime Minister Churchill reportedly knew of the activities of German plainclothes officers and pilots at airfields in Bulgaria. (Eleventh United Press International dispatch)

London: According to reliable sources, 400,000 to 500,000 German troops are now concentrated in Romania or on the Slovak border, awaiting orders to enter Romania. The German headquarters is transporting everything used by the expeditionary force to Romania. Large quantities of munitions and fuel have been concentrated in various important strongholds. (Eleventh United Press International dispatch)

Berlin Denies Sending Troops to Bulgaria Plainclothes Units Active Is a Fact

Stockholm: Reports from Berlin state that Churchill's mention of Bulgaria in his broadcast on Sunday has caused alarm in Berlin. The Berlin correspondent of "Aftonbladet" said that German authorities insist that there is not a single German soldier or pilot in Bulgaria. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

Ankara: It is not known here at present whether any German troops have entered Bulgaria from Romania. However, news has come that the number of German "tourists" entering Bulgaria has been increasing daily. Regarding the rumors that German troops have entered Bulgaria and that Bulgarian airfields have been occupied by Germany, the Bulgarian official news agency officially issued a denial at midnight yesterday. The original text is as follows: "Regarding the statement made by the British Prime Minister in his broadcast on February 9 that German troops have entered Bulgaria and occupied Bulgarian airfields, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency has been ordered to declare that this statement is not in accordance with the facts. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that there is no doubt that German troops are concentrated in Romania. However, the claim that trains full of German troops have arrived in Sofia must be taken with reservation, as there is no direct rail connection between Romania and Bulgaria, and there are no bridges across the Danube River on the common border between the two countries. Moreover, the Danube River is now frozen, with ice accumulating, making it extremely difficult for vehicles to pass. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

New York: A "New York Times" correspondent in the Yugoslav capital reports that large numbers of plainclothes Germans have entered Bulgaria in the past few weeks. A senior diplomat in Sofia estimates their number to be several thousand. Germans are now rapidly taking over the supervision of airfields. It is believed that some German anti-aircraft batteries have recently been deployed, and German trucks are traveling on the roads. Schools in several areas have been closed. Bulgarian troops are now concentrated in the south and southeast. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

Bulgaria in Critical Situation Authorities Discuss Countermeasures

London: A Free French news agency correspondent in Istanbul reports that diplomatic circles in Sofia now believe that the German invasion of Bulgaria is imminent. A Bulgarian cabinet meeting was held last night, and the Bulgarian king has departed from Sofia to his palace in Tekirvo, 60 miles south of the capital. According to a "Times" diplomatic correspondent, some sources believe that the Germans will occupy a part of Bulgaria, including the area from the capital to the Greek border. At that time, they will demand that Greece make concessions to Italy and stop the war, hoping that Greece will succumb. As for Germany, it can apply the same pressure to Turkey. News from various locations along the Danube River states that Germany is concentrating troops and military supplies in Romania. According to a "Times" correspondent in Istanbul, reliable sources say that the number of German troops concentrated has reached 20 divisions. A "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in the Yugoslav capital said that leaders of various opposition parties in Bulgaria have notified Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov, telling him that the entire country does not want and is not prepared to join any form of military action, and warning him not to sever relations with Western European powers.

### German Influence Extends to Southeastern Europe The Attitudes of Turkey and the Soviet Union Are Highly Noteworthy

Ankara: Turkish people express doubts about whether the British Prime Minister's speech mentioning Bulgaria will have much impact on that country. It is said that it is not easy for German troops to invade the Balkans under the resistance of 30 divisions of South troops, 50 divisions of Turkish troops, some Bulgarian troops, and the British navy and air force. However, it is believed that Bulgaria's attitude will be influenced by the demands of domestic reformers, especially to obtain an outlet in the Aegean Sea. Some Turkish observers believe that the Balkan alliance backed by Britain will not only encounter German opposition, but the Soviet Union may also oppose it. At present, there is no sign that the Soviet Union is prepared to provide assistance when the South and Bulgaria are invaded by Germany. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

### Britain and Romania Recall Envoys Mutually British Interests in Romania Entrusted to the Care of the American Ambassador

London: The Romanian Embassy in London has received instructions to issue passports. The Romanian chargé d'affaires visited the Foreign Office this afternoon to formally make this request. There is currently no decision on the date of departure for the embassy staff from England. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

Bucharest: The British announcement of the severance of diplomatic relations with Romania has long been expected by the general public here. Since the entry of German troops into Romania and Romania's joining of the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the relations between Britain and Romania have been tenuous. However, it is not without strangeness that Britain suddenly announced the severance of relations at this time. British Minister Sir Reginald Hoare has requested the Romanian government to issue passports, preparing to lead the entire staff to lower the flag and return home on the 15th of this month. However, the last group of British expatriates has been scheduled to evacuate back to the country on the 12th of this month, and it is also possible that Minister Hoare and the staff will accompany them on that day.

Bucharest: After Britain severed diplomatic relations with Romania, its interests in Romania will be taken care of by the American Minister to Romania, Mr. Gunther. (Tenth Havas dispatch)

### Causes and Consequences of Anglo-Romanian Severance of Relations Motives for Britain's Action Primarily to Warn Bulgaria

London: Official circles in London, speaking of Britain's recall of its envoy, said that German troops had been arriving in Romania in batches for several months, with a small number of people in each batch. At that time, the Romanian government told the British envoy that the arrival of German troops was intended to train the Romanian army in new tactics. However, it later developed into the German headquarters creating various foundations for the expeditionary force in Romania, and stockpiling large quantities of munitions and fuel in various important locations. It is clear that Germany is using Romania as its military base to develop its operational plans. The Romanian government has never objected to this action. The British Embassy is in an impossible position in this environment. The British government has instructed the resident envoy to withdraw the staff of the embassy and consulates, which will be realized within a few days. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

Yugoslav Capital: After the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania, diplomatic circles here are all in a state of calm, saying that this was expected. The motive for Britain's action is that the Romanian authorities arrested a British consul, detained him for ten days, and handed him over to the German authorities. Although the consul was later released, Britain believes that this matter is of great significance. Since German troops are stationed in Romania, British envoys and personnel stationed in the country will no longer be safe. On the other hand, the severance of Anglo-Romanian relations can also be regarded as the result of the recent development of the situation in Southeastern Europe, and its role is to deal with Bulgaria, more so than to deal with Romania. In other words, this British action is primarily to warn Bulgaria that if it allows German troops to enter the country, Britain will also sever diplomatic relations with it. Although this Anglo-Romanian severance of diplomatic relations will not have any immediate impact, if the situation in Bulgaria changes in the future, it may produce certain consequences.

### America Appoints Winant as Special Envoy to Britain Charged with Important Mission Roosevelt's Post-War Plans New Ambassador to Urge British Attention

Washington: Yesterday's news here stated that the newly appointed American Ambassador to Britain, entrusted by President Roosevelt, is charged with an important mission to shift the eyes of British leaders to focus on a sound policy of permanent peace after the war. Government sources revealed that this plan hopes to establish an international human society based on democracy in the economic and political fields. According to the plan, whether defeated or victorious, all must receive fair treatment in society and have a solid foundation in the economy. It is reported that the State Department has already conducted experimental research in drafting this plan. This completed proposal is what the United States wants to use to replace the dictatorship in the new world order. According to the proposal, all nations participating in the international community will enjoy economic stability, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech. The plan also anticipates extensive public works programs in both defeated and victorious countries to address the unemployment problem after the demobilization of troops. The proposal also predicts that Secretary of State Hull's reciprocal trade program will be restored on an international scale. According to this plan, all colonies around the world will be developed through international cooperation. President Roosevelt knew that Winant could do the job, so he appointed Winant as Ambassador to the United Kingdom to shift the eyes of British leaders to this plan. Winant is known for his freedom and has advanced ideas on the world economy. Before the United States withdrew from the League of Nations, Winant was the director of the American Labor Group of the League of Nations. (Eleventh International News Service dispatch)

### Marshal Pétain Stipulates Darlan as Successor Discussions on Organizing New Cabinet Still in Progress

Vichy: It is declared here that the new French cabinet will be announced in today's official gazette. General Pétain will remain the head of state and government. (Eleventh Reuter-Hai Tung dispatch)

Vichy: The government gazette has recently published a decree stipulating that Vice-Admiral Darlan, Minister of Naval Affairs and Foreign Affairs, will be the successor to Marshal Pétain. If the head of state is unable to perform his duties for other reasons, Vice-Admiral Darlan shall assume the office. If Vice-Admiral Darlan is unable to continue to perform his duties, his successor shall be elected by a majority vote of the Council of State. Before the election, the position of Deputy Prime Minister shall be exercised by the Council of State. In July of last year, the government also issued a decree of the same nature, stipulating that the former Deputy Prime Minister Laval was the successor to Marshal Pétain. When Laval left office on December 13 of last year, this law was repealed. (Eleventh Havas dispatch)

Vichy: The newly appointed French Prime Minister Admiral Darlan is very cautious in selecting cabinet members. The list of the new cabinet will hardly be finalized before the 13th. According to well-informed sources, the new cabinet will be dominated by experts, and the important departments will be headed by military personnel. It is said that Minister of Interior Peyrouton has resigned. (Eleventh Reuter-Hai Tung dispatch)

Vichy: After French Naval Chief Darlan was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, and former Foreign Minister Flandin resigned, the cabinet began discussing the organization of a new cabinet at yesterday's cabinet meeting. At 11:30 a.m., General Huntziger, Minister of Justice Barthélemy, and Minister of Interior Peyrouton went to Marshal Pétain's office for a meeting. As of last night, the discussion had not yet yielded concrete results. There are many comments from the outside world on Naval Chief Darlan's new position. According to well-informed sources, since Darlan has been appointed as Deputy Prime Minister, Marshal Pétain seems to have given him some major powers. Therefore, the establishment of the new cabinet is partly in the hands of Admiral Darlan. (Eleventh Hai Tung dispatch)

Vichy: The law on the reorganization of the Council of State is scheduled to be announced tomorrow. Here is what is known about its contents: (1) Ministers of each department are divided into two types: cabinet ministers and non-cabinet ministers. When the government makes resolutions on the implementation of general principles and resolutions on general government policies, each cabinet minister may supervise and adjust the activities of several non-cabinet ministers. (2) Appoint one person among the cabinet ministers as Deputy Prime Minister to guide and supervise the activities of the cabinet ministers in accordance with the wishes of the head of state and the government leader, just as the cabinet ministers supervise the non-cabinet ministers.

The Deputy Prime Minister shall report the circumstances to the head of state afterwards. (4) The Council of State is organized by all cabinet ministers, but when discussing departmental affairs, relevant non-cabinet ministers may be invited to attend. (5) The cabinet meeting is presided over by the Deputy Prime Minister, and all cabinet ministers and non-cabinet ministers may attend. (6) Under the office of the Deputy Prime Minister, an Information, News, and Wireless Telegraph Management Office shall be established. (7) The government organization law promulgated on September 6 of last year shall be repealed from today. (Eleventh Havas dispatch)

### Britain Takes Steps to Prevent Germany from Using Poison Gas British Aircraft Launch Fierce Daytime Raids on Key French Ports Fierce Air Battles Occur over the English Channel

London: A Reuters Air Force correspondent said that the British authorities' national defense plans also take into account the possibility of the Axis air force using poison gas. Therefore, steps have now been taken to guard against this threat. Britain, in accordance with the 1925 Geneva Protocol, has guaranteed that it will not use poison gas unless the enemy uses it first. Therefore, if poison gas does appear, it must be Germany who uses it first. Germany used this weapon first in the last war and later guaranteed that it would not use it again. However, its ally Italy used poison gas during the conquest of Abyssinia. The Axis countries may follow this precedent. It is widely believed that Germany has no new poison gas, and what can be called new is the previously unforeseen method of using poison gas. It is widely believed that the use of poison gas to terrorize civilians will probably not happen. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)

London: The British Air Ministry announced this morning that the British Air Force concentrated its attacks on the invasion bases along the English Channel yesterday during the daytime, with great success. One hundred British bombers, escorted by fighter planes, carried out air raids. The activity of German planes over Britain yesterday has been reduced to a minimum. It is said that two German planes were shot down, while three British planes did not return. Hundreds of tons of bombs exploded in Dunkirk, Boulogne, and Calais. The explosion of British bombs shook the Dover coast. The red light on the French coast was clearly visible at dusk. The dockyards and harbor facilities of Dunkirk were heavily bombed. There were six major fires in Boulogne. Ships and barges in the harbor were hit by bombs. At the same time, it is said that there was only a short air raid alert in London yesterday, but no bombs were dropped. (Eleventh International News Service dispatch)

Berlin: This afternoon, the German military communique stated that yesterday, enemy bombers, under the cover of fighters, attempted to fly into the German occupied area along the English Channel. However, German fighters and anti-aircraft guns were very active and finally repelled the enemy planes. In this battle, the enemy lost nine planes, of which six were shot down by German planes and three were destroyed by anti-aircraft guns. Last night, enemy planes went to northern Germany, and incendiary bombs fell in nine locations. Although fires broke out, they were quickly extinguished. Several civilians were killed or injured. Fighters shot down eight enemy planes, and anti-aircraft guns shot down four enemy planes. The anti-aircraft guns of the German ships along the Norwegian coast also repelled one enemy plane. A total of 33 enemy planes were shot down yesterday. Only two German planes are missing. (Eleventh Hai Tung dispatch)

### British Aircraft Attack German Industrial Area at Night

London: Last night, the British Air Force launched a concentrated attack on the important railway and industrial center of Hanover in Germany for six hours. Fires broke out in many places within the target area. From a transportation point of view, Hanover is the connection point for the main routes in the east, west, north of Germany, so it is particularly important. The German radio station stopped broadcasting from 8 p.m. last night and has not resumed this morning, which proves the activity of the British Air Force in German airspace.

### Japan's New Budget Sets a Record, Newspapers Urge the Public to Make Every Effort to Absorb Public Bonds

Tokyo – Japan's total budget for 1941-1942 was originally 11,630,000,000 yen.

### British Forces Launch New Offensive in East Africa, Employing Pincer Movement to Encircle Eritrea

Cairo – It is announced here that British forces have occupied Mausa Teccles, a small village on the Red Sea coast, 40 miles from the border between Eritrea and Sudan. British forces have also announced the occupation of Karora, a small town 40 miles inside the Eritrean border. London reports that the British offensive from the north into Eritrea appears to be a new operation, as today marks the first time the communiqué has mentioned any military action in the north. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

Cairo – The mopping-up of Benghazi is "proceeding smoothly," while the British vanguard has advanced 200 miles towards Tripoli. Large formations of British aircraft are continuously bombing Tripoli, especially the naval base there, where aircraft, hangars, and railways have been heavily damaged. (International dispatch of the 11th)

London – The British Navy recently shelled the coast of Eritrea. This action by the British Navy is a harbinger of a new offensive launched by British forces on the northern coastal plain. Military observers believe that since the British forces have been very successful in attacking Graziani's forces in Libya, this type of warfare will certainly also be applied to Eritrea. The British forces advancing from the north are now in a position to cut off the escape route of 15,000 Italian troops defending Keren. Another British force is already attacking these Italian troops. The British advance from the north appears to be a large-scale encirclement of the Italian forces.

### Bloodshed in New York Hotel, Victim Krivitsky, Former Soviet Secret Police Chief

Washington – Yesterday, attention here was focused on a mysterious shooting in a Washington hotel. The victim was identified as Krivitsky, the former chief of the Soviet secret police in Western Europe. Krivitsky recently told the New Deal Committee that he wanted to expose the activities of the Fifth Column in the United States. It is generally known that Krivitsky had presented evidence against Communist activities in the U.S. and those opposed to the U.S. government. It cannot be determined whether the shooting was a suicide or murder. However, federal police officers believe that Krivitsky's death was a political revenge. Krivitsky had recently written several articles for the Saturday Evening Post exposing the Soviet secret police situation in France and the United States. Krivitsky claimed that he knew all the branches of the Soviet secret police. A certain far-left newspaper in the United States attempted to declare Krivitsky's writings as nothing but deception, but this attempt was unsuccessful. In his articles published in the Saturday Evening Post, Krivitsky was the first to predict the German-Soviet pact. Krivitsky also revealed that Germany is currently mass-producing counterfeit U.S. currency. (International News Service dispatch of the 11th)

### World's First Stereoscopic Cinema Opens in Moscow

Moscow – After months of preparation, Moscow recently built the world's first stereoscopic cinema. Viewers no longer need to use stereoscopic lenses. In the six days since its opening, it has attracted 30,000 viewers. According to the inventor, Ivanov, "I am very satisfied with the performance, and the audience's response is good. It can be said that it has been a success." Another scientist, Avanba, said, "This kind of undertaking should be expanded, and I am very impressed by it." The construction of the screen in the stereoscopic cinema is different from ordinary screens. Due to the effect of the stereoscopic lens, viewers can see the singers walk out of the screen, as if they were in the same place. At the same time, viewers feel that tree branches and flowers are close at hand, and the surging tide seems to be rushing towards them. (TASS dispatch of the 11th)

### Municipal Council Election Should Be Based on Land Regulations, Japan Attempts to Disrupt the Longstanding Electoral System, Britain Believes It Exceeds Council Authority

This year's Municipal Council election is based on Article 18 of the Land Regulations of the Shanghai International Settlement, and is conducted according to the system and methods that have remained unchanged since 1869. Maintaining the ratio of five British, two American, and two Japanese seats, it is expected that the United Front adopted by the British and American communities will continue to be victorious, and Japan's attempt to change the status quo of the settlement will ultimately fail. However, it was discovered in yesterday's Municipal Council Gazette that Japan intends to disrupt the electoral system and methods that have been used for many years, and suggests implementing a one-person, one-vote system to defeat the opposing side. The development of this action will certainly be valued by all Chinese and foreign citizens in Shanghai. Therefore, the Municipal Council's Special Election Committee held a meeting, where the Japanese member, Yasui Gengo, repeatedly brought up old matters, and strongly criticized the "dispersed voting method" used by the British and American groups. The representatives of Japan's Axis allies, Germany and Italy, also added fuel to the fire, attacking the British, American, and French groups, attempting to cancel the old election law.

Japanese Attempt to Change the Electoral Unit

The Special Municipal Gazette published by the Municipal Council yesterday published the full text of the committee's mixed report. The majority of the mixed report records the suggestions of the Japanese member Yasui Gengo. The reasons for Yasui Gengo's suggestions are as follows: According to the provisions of the Land Regulations, no commercial firm or individual may have more than one vote. However, "some companies often divide themselves into many nominal owner units, claiming that the property of such companies is jointly owned by employees, in order to increase the number of votes." Yasui believes that such nominal landowners should not be considered qualified voters. This suggestion was seconded by the German member, Greider, and the Italian member, Fomica Gali. The opponents were the American member, Carna, the British member, Mitchell, and the French member, Shavali. The two sides each had three votes, an equal number. Under these circumstances, the committee can only add further research to Yasui Gengo's suggestions before submitting another report.

The Current Situation Will Not Change

The reason for opposing the current election law is that the Municipal Council cannot ask the landowner to explain that he is a genuine landowner except to ask the landowner to show the deed issued by the consulate. Although the report does not state whether the committee can make any decisions on the issue of amending the election law in this election, well-informed sources do not believe that there is a possibility of immediate change in the final period of the election law.

Electoral Rolls Should Be Published

Although the opinions of the Special Election Committee are not consistent in this regard, they have reached a consensus in other areas. The committee made the following recommendations to the Municipal Council: (1) Appoint five foreign members to form a committee to review applications to vote and report their opinions to the Municipal Council. (2) The committee recommends to the Municipal Council that the electoral roll be published immediately after the end of the voting application so that people who are not on the electoral roll (except for those with omissions and errors in their names) cannot participate in the election. The final electoral roll should be distributed in the same way as the preliminary electoral roll. (3) The committee "strongly recommends" that the Municipal Council should notify the consular corps that, for the benefit of all parties, it should end the acceptance of voting applications one month before the first day of the election. After that date, all applications will be invalid. (4) The preliminary electoral roll should be compiled as soon as possible after December 1 each year, six weeks before the election date, posted in the Municipal Council Building, and distributed to the consulates, foreign communities, and general associations, and announced in the newspapers for public knowledge.

Voting Procedures Must Be Strict

(5) The committee also recommended to the Municipal Council that the following "minor modifications" be adopted in the election procedure: (a) Copies of voting passes are only valid at the designated polling place. (b) The number of ballot boxes at each polling place should not be limited to one, but should be increased according to the number of votes. (c) It is stipulated that the ballots should be sent to the tellers immediately after the end of the first day of the election, without delay. (d) It is stipulated that after the end of each day's election, the openings of the ballot boxes should be sealed in front of the tellers.

Britain Refutes Based on Legal Principles

Mitchell expressed opposition to Yasui's suggestion, saying, "This move is inconsistent with the current legal arguments and exceeds the scope of the Municipal Council's powers. The Land Regulations are the constitution of the International Settlement, and the Municipal Council has no power to modify them or deviate from the norm. The Municipal Council has no other way but to add the names of landowners to the electoral list. The detailed circumstances of the landowner are irrelevant to the Municipal Council. If the Municipal Council convenes the foreign consulate to prove that they are the landowner or the person who purchased the land, and conducts a detailed investigation of the relationship with their land, the landowner has the right to refuse this request, but the landowner's right to vote will not disappear as a result."

Fan Ke Ling Appointed Chairman

The committee was established yesterday afternoon in the Municipal Council Building and held its first meeting, electing Fan Ke Ling as chairman. In order to facilitate the advancement of the committee's work, it was also legally added that a representative of the Land Industry Association would be a member of the committee. The research on the issue of unfair tax system will be scheduled for the second meeting this Friday (14th) to continue the discussion.

### Gold Scheduled to Return to the United States, Has Not Resigned from the North China Daily News

It has been rumored recently that Gold, the editor of the North China Daily News, has resigned from the newspaper and left Shanghai, but according to reliable sources, Gold has resigned from the American Community Association, but has not resigned from the newspaper. He is scheduled to return to the United States on the President Coolidge on the 25th. When he will return to Shanghai has not yet been decided.

### Hall Internally Designated as Head of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Western Shanghai Police Force, The Second Precinct Chief Has Also Been Recommended, A Large Number of Settlement Police Officers Will Be Transferred to Western Shanghai

The Western Shanghai Joint District Police Force is still being organized. It is heard that the Public Concession authorities are now planning to make a recommendation to promote Inspector Hall as the head of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Department, and Superintendent Blandinksopp as the head of the Second Police Precinct. This recommendation will soon be submitted to "Mayor" Chen Gongbo for final approval.

Deputy Director-General Still Awaiting Approval

An agreement on the establishment of the new police force stipulates that the Western Shanghai Outer Road area will be divided into five police districts, one of which will be the responsibility of a European police officer (Second District), a Japanese police officer will also be in charge of one district, and the remaining three districts will be managed by three people appointed by the "City" government. So far, the Public Concession has only officially nominated two senior police officers for the new police force, one is Pan Da, who has been approved as Director-General, and the other is Inspector Clisha, who has been designated as Deputy Director, which has not yet been approved by the "City" government, but reliable sources expect that Chen Gongbo will approve it after returning to Shanghai from an important political meeting in Nanjing.

Settlement Police Officers Must Be Replenished

It was also heard yesterday morning that other personnel of the new police force will be selected from the existing police officers of the Public Concession and the "City" government. An officer from the Public Concession Police Department stated yesterday morning that some police officers from the Public Concession may be transferred to the new police force in February, so the Police Department will recruit additional police officers to maintain its existing strength.

Internal Organization Is in Progress

The North China Daily News reported that after the signing of the Shanghai Western Police Power Agreement, the organization of the Special Police Department is underway. The Municipal Council has nominated two candidates for Director-General, and it is rumored that the position of Criminal Section Chief will be taken by Superintendent Blandinksopp of the Municipal Council Police Department. Blandinksopp is responsible for the New Gate Police Station.

### Washington's Birthday, Celebration Suspended, Due to Clouds Looming Over the Far East, All Parties Do Not Intend to Be Extravagant

February 22nd is the birthday of Washington, the first president of the United States. The American people traditionally take a holiday on this day to commemorate it enthusiastically. However, this year, due to the tense situation in the Far East, it is not planned to be extravagant. The U.S. Consul in Shanghai has announced that no official celebrations will be held, and the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Community Association have also stated that there are no celebration plans. That is, the dance party and other social gatherings that are usually held at the Columbia Country Club will also be canceled this year. Due to the evacuation of Americans from American schools, celebration plans have been greatly changed. Although there will be considerable commemorative measures at that time, there will be no grand celebrations.

### New German War Film to Be Shipped to Shanghai Soon

Kodder, the Information Officer of the German Embassy in China, stated to the press yesterday that "So far, more than 100,000 people in Shanghai have been invited to see the film describing the victory of the German army on the Western Front, but there are still 20,000 to 25,000 letters requesting tickets, and those who feel regret. Due to technical reasons, the film cannot be re-screened again. However, another new film is on its way from Berlin. Once the film arrives in Shanghai, it will be screened on a regular basis to entertain all walks of life. The new film is a historical depiction of the German High Command's operations on the Western Front. It was shown on Broadway in New York and was sold out for several weeks in a row. Its attention-grabbing nature can be imagined.

Kodder continued, "It is scheduled to invite the local press to visit the news film that has arrived here next Monday (17th). The film has a vivid depiction of Germany's construction projects in Europe. After inviting the press, the film will also be scheduled to invite people from all walks of life to visit.

### U.S. Ship Chaumont Reported to Arrive in Shanghai Soon, Will Carry a Replacement Company of Soldiers, The Exact Date of Arrival Is Still Confidential

U.S. Naval authorities here yesterday (11th) kept the date of arrival of the U.S. transport ship Chaumont in Shanghai a secret, refusing to disclose any official information. However, it is heard that the Chaumont will arrive in Shanghai in the second half of this month for a short stay, or may go to Qinhuangdao before returning to the United States. It is expected that about 150 soldiers from the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai will board the Chaumont to return to the United States. It is believed that the U.S. Marine Corps soldiers who will replace them in Shanghai will come on this transport ship. As for the date of arrival of the Chaumont in Shanghai, no news was available yesterday, and it is also unknown whether the ship will go to Qinhuangdao.

No News of U.S. Ship Summering

When the reporter inquired about the annual action of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet sailing from Manila to North China every summer, an official of the U.S. Navy here stated that he had not received any news, and could not disclose any information about the matter at present. It is also unknown whether Admiral Hurd, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, will come to Shanghai soon.

### Municipal Council Taxation Subcommittee Holds First Meeting Yesterday, Studying Complex Problems of Taxation, Will Take Two Months to Discuss

The Municipal Council recently organized a subcommittee of five members to study the inequality of donations and taxes in the Public Concession. The members are Fan Ke Ling (former Chairman of the Municipal Council, a well-known American lawyer in this city), Jones (the Municipal Council Administrator, currently practicing law at Ellis & Hays), Meyer (Director of Jinlong & Co.), Sun Ruihuang (Deputy General Manager of Xinhua Trust & Savings Bank), and Okamoto (Japanese lawyer). The committee held its first meeting yesterday (11th) afternoon, elected the chairman, and began to study the taxation issue.

Studying the Method of Levying Salary Tax

The committee is now encountering many complex issues related to the taxation situation in the Public Concession. It will take at least two months of continuous study to submit a report and recommendations to the Municipal Council. One of the issues is to decide on a new method of taxation, including the possibility of levying new taxes on currently tax-exempt commercial concerns, the most important of which is the Securities Exchange of this city. It is expected that the committee will conduct an in-depth study of the Securities Exchange, and the brewery in this city will be another source of tax revenue studied by the committee, with the aim of increasing the Municipal Council's income.

Opinions from All Parties Will Be Accepted as Much as Possible

Frick, the Municipal Council Administrator and Chief Executive Officer, told reporters that the Bureau will allow representatives of various public organizations and individuals to express their opinions to the new committee. It is expected that the main person who will express V views on the issue of tax inequality to the committee is the British Liddell, who proposed an amendment to the Municipal Council's tax increase plan, which was rejected at the Foreign Association Special Meeting on Taxation last week.

### Rice Prices Fall

It is learned that 50,000 bags of foreign rice will arrive within the next ten days. It is also learned that British firm Jardine Matheson & Co., German firm Defoe & Co., Swiss firm Fu Jia & Co., Japanese firm Nikko & Co., and Shenji, Jianyuan, Nanyang Enterprise, and other companies have recently telegraphed to the rice-producing areas in West Luo, Rangoon, and other places to negotiate the transaction of a large amount of foreign rice, totaling more than 200,000 bags. The foreign rice that has been transacted will be transported to Shanghai for regulation in a short period of time. Yesterday, sources in the foreign firm community revealed that recently, as foreign exchange has become more relaxed and foreign rice production prices have fallen, many large rice merchants have entrusted various foreign firms to purchase them, and there are not a few people whose number is more than 5,000 bags. Yesterday's rice market, due to the long-term release of foreign exchange and the availability of sufficient reserves, the prices of various grades of rice have fallen to varying degrees. According to the rice industry, rice prices may continue to fall in the near future.

The Rice Storage Committee's 200,000 bags of stored rice are mostly assumed by rice industry organizations, reaching 60,000 bags, worth about 6 million in cash. According to a gentleman familiar with the rice industry, there are about 800 rice stores, more than 200 rice firms, and more than 30 miscellaneous grain businesses in the city, with a total capital of about 30 million. Then the payment of 6 million for public warehouse funds accounts for about one-fifth of the total capital of the city's rice industry. It is also learned that the revised rules of the rice industry market, which were decided to be revised at the Rice Market Management Committee meeting the day before yesterday, will be drafted today and submitted to the Bean and Rice Association for review and then promulgated and implemented.

Flour merchants in this city have recently ordered from Australia, Canada, and the United States, among which Australia has the most. The cost is only about 18 yuan per bag, and a profit of more than 5 yuan can be obtained. Therefore, other merchants are also rushing to join the reservation, with a total number of no less than 1 million bags. It is heard that 300,000 bags will be shipped this month, and the rest will be shipped in batches soon. By then, the reserves will be greatly increased and will be sufficient for five months of need.

### In Memory of Mr. Xiong Deshan (2)

— Nan Hu

After Yuan Shikai's attempt to restore the monarchy in the fifth year of the Republic failed, I went from Sichuan to Beijing to resume my post as a member of parliament. Mr. Xiong frequently traveled between Beijing and Hubei, associating with scholars and literati like Mr. Ping. At that time, the New Culture Movement was just beginning to sprout, and he often wrote articles for various newspapers and publications, expressing his personal aspirations. During the gestation of the May Fourth Movement, he was deeply moved and played a significant role in planning and campaigning for it. He edited a weekly magazine called "New China," which ceased publication due to various reasons after being published for more than ten months.

By the tenth year of the Republic, socialist ideas, influenced by the Soviet Revolution, had spread to China. Mr. Xiong, Kuang Mohan, and I devoted ourselves to studying the practical facilities of the labor and peasant government and exploring the true meaning of Marxism. We organized a Marxist study group at that time. Mr. Xiong's early studies in social science and Japanese, which had long been neglected, were rekindled with diligent effort. His later contributions to academia were mainly based on the foundation laid at that time. He and Kuang Mohan, along with seven or eight others, briefly joined the Socialist Youth League (S.Y., the predecessor of C.Y.) which was just being organized. In January of the eleventh year, Mr. Xiong, Kuang Mohan, and I organized the Communist Comrades Society, publishing various publications. Mr. Xiong's translations of "Critique of the Gotha Program" and "History of the International Workingmen's Association" were important documents related to the labor movement, and Engels' authoritative work "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State" was also first introduced to China by him.

In the autumn of the eleventh year, Qu Qiubai returned to China from the Soviet Union. Through the mediation and introduction of Mr. Xiong and Liu Zitong, we all joined the CP and dissolved the Communist Comrades Society. However, our organizational relationship with the CP was soon severed. After that, he gradually shifted completely from politics to academics.

In the fourteenth year, I recommended Chen Hongshu to be the Director of Education in Hubei Province. At the suggestion of Mr. Xiong, Qian Tieru, Ning Dunwu, and Deng Chumin, Mr. Zhang Huaijiu (Zhiben) was recommended as the president of the Beihu Law School, and Mr. Xiong served as a professor, marking the beginning of his career in education. At that time, it was the height of the National Revolution. He and Mr. Qian and Mr. Ning lived in the northern corner of Wuchang City. Every day, many young people would come to them to discuss issues, and they devoted their energy to guiding them. The residence became an invisible gathering place for revolutionary youth in Wuhan, which was the period when he had the deepest influence on young people. Now Mr. Xiong has passed away, and most of those young people have already sacrificed themselves for the revolution! During the siege of Wuchang in the Northern Expedition, they were trapped in the besieged city, enduring hardship, but they still risked hunger and their lives to continue guiding the revolutionary youth.

After the National Revolutionary Army captured Wuchang, the Wuchang Higher Normal School was used as the foundation, and other national and provincial higher specialized schools were merged to form a university (the predecessor of Wuhan University). Mr. Xiong was one of the famous professors at that time. Until the Wuhan coup in the autumn of the sixteenth year, he could no longer live in Wuchang, so he took refuge in Shanghai, writing articles for various newspapers and magazines from time to time. In the eighteenth year, he, Li Da, Qian Tieru, Ning Dunwu, Zhang Dingfu, Deng Chumin, Shi Cuntong, and others opened the Kunlun Bookstore, systematically introducing famous works of social science. Mr. Xiong specialized in social history and economics, and his important works and translations include "Research on Chinese Social History," "A History of Materialist Economics," and "Basic Theory of Marxist Economics." He was also one of the participants in the debate on Chinese social history after the twentieth year of the Republic. The two articles he provided for the debate—"A Historical Description of the Chinese Peasant Problem" and "A Study on the Emergence of Chinese Commercial Capital"—were also examined with a prudent scientific attitude to review the longitudinal section of Chinese society. In the article on the peasant problem, his analysis of the stagnant phenomenon of material rent in China, and in the article on commercial capital, his clarification of various fallacies of the time based on Marx's views, both had extraordinary insights. He absolutely did not have the common problem of arbitrary abuse and scolding that was found among those who generally participated in the debate.

From the twentieth year of the Republic, he taught at the Shanghai College of Law and Politics in Dapuqiao for several years. In the twenty-fourth year, he was hired as a professor at the Liangfeng Normal College in Guangxi, lecturing on Chinese General History. The following year, Liangshi merged into Guangxi University and was renamed the College of Liberal Arts, and he continued to serve as a professor of general history. That general history lecture notes can be regarded as the crystallization of his final efforts and also as a rare masterpiece in history books, but he only lectured up to the Ming Dynasty before passing away. It is said that Mr. Li is currently proofreading and editing it for him. Once Mr. Li's preface is completed, Mr. Qian and I will proofread it again and send it to print to fulfill his unfinished initial wish. (To be continued)

### Arrested Workers of French Electric Company Released on Bail Yesterday

Regarding the dispute caused by the "union" sending people to collect fees and causing a fight at the French merchant tram company, the arrest of four workers involved has been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the four arrested workers were approved by the police station yesterday to be released on bail. Yesterday, a so-called "Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union" sent a letter, making a defense on this matter. The main points are as follows: (1) Always uphold the principle of seeking the welfare of the masses and not being exploited by anyone. Collecting membership fees is a regular practice on the tenth of each month. (2) Regarding the compensation for Zhang Yongkang, who was injured and died during the strike, a total of 2,400 yuan in national currency was collected. Except for 850 yuan that Zhang's mother successively received, only 1,550 yuan remained. It was originally intended to be distributed to the deceased's mother in advance. However, because there was another type of donation, it would be distributed to Zhang's mother together after the collection was completed. Unexpectedly, a few people clashed with the staff. Regarding this matter, Zhang's mother will provide evidence based on the facts to inform the public. (3) It has absolutely nothing to do with the 28 suspects arrested for the killing of inspector Chen Guohua, because the Chen case occurred before the strike. Also, the statement that the workers raised 5,600 yuan and transferred it to the families of the arrested is completely unfounded.

### Another Large Batch of Japanese Police Officers Promoted, Reaching More Than Forty

### Superintendent of the Police Department, Crawford, Resigns

Crawford, a Western superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, has served for sixteen years and has worked in various police stations. He has now resigned due to old age and will leave Shanghai in the near future to return to New Zealand via the United States. All his colleagues in the department held a farewell party at the Police Club at 5:15 p.m. the day before yesterday, and the Chief of the Special Affairs Division, Robertson, presented him with a beautiful set of tableware as a souvenir.

### Hayashi Yuji Resigns from His Post and Awaits Transfer to Nagasaki for Interrogation, Meeting with Western Reporters Was Extremely Joyful, Claiming He Could Not Speak Freely Due to Legal Restrictions

Hayashi Yuji, a Japanese resident aged 70, shot and injured the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Caisewei, and three Japanese directors of the Council on January 23. He was initially tried by the Japanese Consul's court in Shanghai and released on bail last week. After returning to his residence, he "voluntarily" closed his doors and did not go out, awaiting the Japanese Consul's court to decide whether to transfer him back to Nagasaki for formal interrogation.

Western Reporters Visited Yesterday

A Western reporter visited his private residence on Shilean Road yesterday and was received by Mr. Hayashi. He made a statement saying, "I have a lot to say, but I cannot speak freely due to the current circumstances." Mr. Hayashi was extremely joyful when talking to the Western reporter, but expressed his apology, saying that he was prohibited by law from making any public statements before being transferred to Nagasaki for trial, so he could not talk too much with you. It is heard that Mr. Hayashi will soon be transferred to Nagasaki, but he refused to disclose the exact date.

### Searching Public Buses, Finding a Handgun, Detectives Searched and Found it Discarded on the Floor, Twelve Passengers Detained for Investigation

In view of the fact that robbers often mix in with public buses and rob passengers of their property recently, the Public Concession Police Department has specially ordered the search team to specialize in searching public buses. At 7:10 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Chinese and Western detectives of the police department's search team searched bus No. 15137 of Route 10 on Beijing Road and found a Ma brand handgun with four bullets on the floor next to the seats in the rear half of the bus. When picked up, the gun handle was still slightly warm, indicating that it had been discarded just moments before.

Discarded the Gun

In order to facilitate the investigation, all the passengers in the bus were taken to the Laozha Police Station. After investigation by Chinese detective Guo Ruiquan, it was determined that the passengers in the front half of the bus were far away from the gun and had no criminal suspicion, so they were released. However, the passengers in the rear half of the bus who were close to the gun, including Dong Ruihua, Xing Bu'ao, Wang Shenggui, Shen Yuanyuan, Wang Rongding, Gao Zhikang, Jiang A'er, Shu Jisheng, Yang Tinggeng, Wu Jinrong, Yuan Haiqing, and Zheng Meifu, were highly suspicious, so they were

Detained Together

They were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special First Court yesterday morning. The police department's lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the confiscated handgun was the one that was robbed from the police officer of Siwen Police Station at No. 403 Cihou South Lane, Hartung Road, on the 10th of last month. Now, because it cannot be determined who placed the gun on the floor of the bus, it is requested that they be temporarily detained, pending further investigation to determine whether to prosecute or release them separately. Judge Feng核稟 ordered that all suspects be detained pending further investigation.

### Gasoline in a Rickshaw Suddenly Caught Fire, Passenger Seriously Burned

The passenger was burned on his left leg and other places and rolled out of the rickshaw. The police officer on duty discovered the incident, called the fire truck to the scene to extinguish the fire. The entire rickshaw was destroyed.

In the morning, the transaction price of the US exchange rate ranged from 5.4375 yuan to 5.46875 yuan. This was due to the continued negative news from abroad. Although the US freezing of French and German funds was not related to the exchange market, people's minds were affected. Also, the rumor that the US garrison in this city was withdrawing and the tense rumors between Japan and the US both expanded the selling pressure. However, the afternoon close was still fixed.

But after that, people's hearts became more and more scattered. The reason was that the US garrison in this city would make a retreat, and the news that the relationship between Japan and the US would inevitably deteriorate was considered to be negative news.

Later, it was reported that the exchange market slightly tended to soften, and there were vague rumors of positive news, which aroused a considerable Yuan wind. It is estimated that Xinfeng Yong, Tongkang Chengji, Tiancheng Yida, and Suifu, etc., competed to buy, reaching 6,480 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 6,477 yuan, which was 41 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price.

It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf at 1:00 PM yesterday to unload. The Swire Shipping Company vessel "Hanyang" also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Hong Kong, carrying 2,611 bags of foreign rice. It docked at the [unnamed] Company Wharf outside the French Concession to unload. An additional 1,281 bags will be transported to Tianjin on the same vessel tomorrow. Furthermore, the Jardine Matheson & Co. vessel "Hosang" arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon; it is said to have also carried foreign rice, but the exact quantity is unclear and will be reported after investigation today. (Zu)

The rice market has been flooded with a continuous influx of rice. The foreign exchange rate has been easing for days, which is advantageous for the import of foreign rice. Moreover, with the continuous arrival of rice, the stock of rice in Shanghai has more than doubled. People, seeing the abundance of rice, have no intention of stocking up. Consequently, sales are sluggish, and sellers lack the strength to support prices. Stockpilers dare not even think of accumulating inventory. Closing prices were half to one yuan lower than the previous day's. No. 1 new Saigon rice was priced at 81.5 to 81 yuan, Pudong godown rice at 80.05 yuan, Annam glutinous rice at 82.5 to 82 yuan, No. 2 rice at 78 to 76 yuan, No. 1 special rice at 81 to 80 yuan, Zhongguan rice at 78 to 79 yuan, and fire-milled rice at 80.05 yuan, then down to 78.8 yuan, small-milled rice at 73.8 to 73.5 yuan, Pudong godown rice at 72.6 to 72 yuan, large-milled rice at 71.5 to 71 yuan, Tokyo polished rice at 72 yuan, special rice bran at 71 yuan, general market rice at 70 to 69 yuan, and broken polished rice at 65 yuan, then down to No. 3 rice at 56.5 yuan. Spot sales of English Chinese Company small-milled rice were offered at only 85.4 to 85.5 yuan, which was a small amount. Forward sales for February and March were 86.5 to 86.6 yuan, and No. 1 Saigon rice for February was 93 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was over 400 tons, with spot rice less than 6,000 bags.

Thick and thin glutinous rice and other domestic rice shipments have arrived sporadically, slightly more than before, but due to poor sales, the market has difficulty holding steady and has fallen half a yuan in line with foreign rice. Changbang raw white glutinous rice was priced at 105 to 106 yuan, and by the picul, 101 to 102 yuan; Kunshan raw glutinous rice was 103 to 104 yuan, and by the picul, 100 to 99.5 yuan; Qingjiao thin rice was 94 yuan by the picul; there was a lack of raw bagged goods and no market.

Transactions of glutinous rice were rare, and there was little change in the market. However, special white glutinous rice was uniquely popular due to its scarcity and aroma. Hong Kong special round-grain glutinous rice was priced at 81.5 yuan, while general market goods remained at 80 to 78 yuan.

### Foreign Wheat Orders Have Arrived in Port; Returned Flour Is Being Sold for the First Time

Spot transactions of foreign flour continue to be sluggish. This is because factory-ordered foreign wheat has already arrived in port, increasing the supply. Also, it is now acceptable for a small number of customers to sell, so the returned goods are being released first. As actual sales to local customers are not good, the market is invisibly loosening. The price of Flower & Bird brand Australian flour is 24.4 to 24 yuan, slightly lower than before by 3 to 4 cents. Futures transactions are scarce, and buyers and sellers are cautious. Chinese factory flour is still selling for 23 yuan. Amidst this soft market, the supply from each factory is gradually becoming more abundant, while actual sales are lower than the prescribed amount. This is because, with rice prices looking weak, people's minds are difficult to steady.

The wheat market remains dull and stable. The Suzhou factory is not eager to purchase local wheat, as newly arrived foreign wheat is being unloaded. Japanese factories are still purchasing at limited prices, but only absorbing small amounts at the retail level, lacking any substantial volume.

### Oilcake: Oilcake Prices Drop Across the Board

Yesterday, the oilcake market showed a general decline. The reason was sluggish actual sales, an unfavorable environment for bullish traders, and eager resale, resulting in a general drop in prices. As a result, peanut oil and factory oil maintained their original prices. Spot Dalian soybean oil fell by 2 yuan, and futures oil fell by 3 to 4 yuan. Transactions included 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 100 loads of Dayou factory soybean oil, and 100 barrels of Dasu soybean oil, as well as 400 barrels of soybean oil futures. The outflow of spot cakes is stagnant, and futures cakes are falling continuously due to market sentiment and their speculative nature, falling by 1 to 3 cents. A total of over 70,000 pieces of various brands of futures cakes were offered. Today, 5,895 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Singapore.

### Yarn and Cotton: Large Players Exit, Yarn Market Plummets, Double Horse Brand Enters the 1,400 Yuan Mark, Dropping a Total of 91 Yuan in Two Days

The yarn market continued to weaken, and the price decline was especially intense. This was because speculators were uneasy, and rumors abounded in the market. Major players were heavily liquidating their positions, and floating traders became even more anxious in light of this situation. Moreover, actual transactions were extremely sluggish. As a result, when the market loosened, prices plummeted. 20-count Double Horse yarn broke through the 400 yuan barrier. The highest price was 1,443 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,389 yuan. It was initially traded at 1,393 yuan in the afternoon, followed by 1,384 yuan, and the final price was 1,408 yuan. Some buyers were interested.

The opening price for Double Horse in the morning was low due to the previous day's large decline, and most market participants were taking a wait-and-see approach. Since the price had already fallen significantly, the opening price was 1,440 yuan, rising slightly to 43 yuan. Then, news spread that the foreign exchange rate was flat and gold prices were falling, and the price dropped to 1,427 yuan. But short covering pushed the price back up to 1,442 yuan. This cycle repeated three or four times. Unexpectedly, after 1:00 PM, rumors in the market intensified, claiming that the foreign exchange rate was being frozen and gold prices were falling sharply. Sellers rushed in like a flood, and the market volume decreased, plummeting below the 1,400 yuan mark, down to 1,389 yuan. The closing price was 1,394 yuan. According to statistics, 8,850 bales were traded in half a day, all among industry peers. The price of 20-count Variant Horse yarn fell by 51 yuan.

### Cotton Market Stagnant

The current cotton situation is that the market is extremely weak due to the disastrous decline in the yarn market. Domestic and foreign factories are all hesitant to act, so prices are also trending downward. Trading has completely stalled.

### Piece Goods: Selling Pressure Dominates the Market, Importers Hesitant, Resulting in Repeated Low Offers

Factory cloth prices fell yesterday, and the market stabilized later in the day. The opening prices were consistently lower, continuing the previous day's weakness. Due to pervasive selling pressure, actual sales customers were wary of buying, and floating traders were particularly anxious. Therefore, low bids were frequent and transactions were quiet. The lowest price for Dapeng Fugui fine cloth was 41 yuan. As a result of transactions, fine cloth and twill continued to fall by 1 to 1.5 yuan per piece, coarse cloth fell by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth prices varied, falling by 0.5 to 1 yuan per piece. This street saw the transaction of over 400 pieces of various cloths, and the Ningbo-Ningbo color and bleached cloths exceeded 100 pieces. The Fujian-Guangdong color cloths, pongee and bleached cloths amounted to one hundred and dozens of pieces. 54 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Singapore on the 12th.

Eastern cloth prices fell sharply. The White Dragon Head cloth opened at 46.78 yuan, rose to 47.8 yuan, and then, with the sharp fall in yarn prices and strong selling pressure, fell back to 46.5 yuan at midday closing. The after-market dark market was even weaker, with the lowest price being 45.5 yuan. But, due to the continuous sharp drop, Tianjin traders and scattered stockpilers covered their positions and searched for goods, rebounding to 46.75 yuan. (Stock Exchange) The closing prices for futures were 47 yuan for February, 48.75 yuan for March, 50.05 yuan for April, and 51.12 yuan for May.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Rise Slightly

Yesterday, sentiment in the sugar market improved, and the trend was positive, with prices rising a few cents. The association set prices: spot No. 24 raw white foreign warehouse at 80.08 yuan, shipments scheduled for February 24th at 81.1 yuan, shipments scheduled for the end of February at 81.3 yuan, and shipments scheduled for the 10th of next month at 81.5 to 81.4 yuan, an increase of 3 to 4 cents. Taikoo granulated sugar saw little fluctuation. B mark Western warehouse at 80 to 80.2 yuan, DY mark Western warehouse at 78.2 to 78.4 yuan, and HX mark Western warehouse at 77.9 to 78.2 yuan, an increase of 2 cents.

### Coal: With a Chilly Spring, White Coal Is Still in Demand

Since the sharp drop in bituminous coal prices recently, the coal market has been rather weak. However, the sales of white coal are still very brisk due to the chilly spring, and transactions among peers are not quiet, so prices remain stable. Yesterday, the opening price for Tongdelibai white coal, No. 1, 2, and 3 lump warehouse receipts, was 245 yuan per ton. The Douzhuang Festival lump coal in this street was 156 yuan, including delivery.

### Hardware: Staples Stockpilers Release Their Inventory

The staple market has been deteriorating daily. This is because stockpilers are releasing large quantities of inventory, and the market is feeling more congested. Moreover, actual transactions are not smooth because the Nanyang routes have not recovered, and northern merchants are only making sparse purchases. Although there are sporadic transactions on this street, it is difficult to reverse the declining trend. Therefore, opening prices are falling step by step, and market sentiment is weakening. Last year, the price of Tongbeisijia staples was listed at 100 yuan, but there were still few inquiries. Raw materials (wire rods) have also been dragged down. The market price yesterday was around 120 yuan per load, also down by about 10 to 20 yuan. Furthermore, 250 bundles of wire were shipped from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Miscellaneous: Upper-Grade Cigarettes Increase in Price

Sales of mid-range cigarettes are sluggish, and purchase prices are weakening. The prices of upper-grade cigarettes are rising due to the limited quantity released by the factories, which is insufficient for market sales. For example, 50-cigarette Da Nanwei are at 1,050 yuan per 10,000, 20-cigarette Da Nanwei are at 1,080 yuan per 10,000, and 50-cigarette Da Sanpaotai are at 700 yuan per 10,000. The Hua Cheng Company has halved the distribution of cigarettes to industry peers, so purchase prices on the market continue to be tight. Da Meili brand middle boxes are offered at 730 yuan, Jinshu brand middle boxes at 470 yuan, and the factory price of Ruilun 50-cigarette flat-pack Consul brand cigarettes has increased to 920 yuan.

The final battle of the 13th Western Youth Invitational Basketball League will be held tonight at 8:15 PM. Huaxing and the McClain Military Officers, both with perfect records, will compete for the championship. Huaxing has emerged as a dark horse this year, boasting strong players such as Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Bao Songyuan, and Ren Xiangcheng, all top talents of their time. The return of Wang Hongbin has further strengthened their strength. Their lineup is strong, and their offense and defense are both excellent.

With the two teams meeting, the outcome will determine the championship, and a fierce battle is to be expected. In order to limit the audience, the Western Youth authorities have increased ticket prices to 3 and 4 yuan, and all tickets have now been sold out. Before the final, there will be a match between Liangxi and Little Bear, starting at 7:15 PM.

### Hunan Provincial Government Encourages Primary School Teachers to Teach with Peace of Mind, Awaiting Improved Treatment and Refraining from Strikes

(Leiyang Correspondent) The Hunan Provincial Government issued instructions to the commissioner's offices and county governments, directing them to order the primary school teachers under their jurisdiction to teach with peace of mind and await gradual improvements in their treatment, refraining from strikes. The document stated: "National education is the fundamental plan, and primary school teachers bear the important responsibility of teaching and training. Only through hard work can success be achieved. The government is well aware of the hardships and burdens of the times and is deeply concerned, issuing frequent encouragements, hoping that they will endure the temporary hardships and complete a monumental task. The government is making its utmost efforts to gradually improve salaries and treatment, and the repeated orders are not just empty words. Lower-level teachers should bear the heavy responsibility entrusted by the country and avoid feeling ashamed of themselves. They should be more loyal, devoted to their duties, and await improved treatment. Recently, it has been reported that some have used the pretext of demanding salary increases, stopping classes and making demands, which is harmful to the country, themselves, and the students, and is inappropriate. In addition to issuing separate orders, this urgent order requires you to immediately forward this to primary school teachers under your jurisdiction, so they understand the government's sincerity in caring for them, recognize the importance of their own responsibilities, teach with peace of mind, await gradual improvements in treatment, and refrain from demanding salary increases by taking strike action. You must also investigate and crack down on such behavior to avoid neglect, which is of utmost importance."

Spring and Autumn

### Song of Returning Spring

— Guo Wenqiang

These past two days, I have been waking up earlier than usual for some reason. Perhaps it is because I was awakened by the sharp shouts of the night soil collectors, and I couldn't fall back asleep. It turns out that since the Lunar New Year's Day, the night soil collectors have been "visiting" at 6:30 AM.

"It's better to get up early and take a run in the street." Once the idea was decided, I carried it out. As soon as I ran out of the door and onto the street, two vegetable vendors came head-on.

"Ah, after the Beginning of Spring, the vegetables can't stand the heat. As soon as they touch the sun, they will wrinkle up and look terrible." The vegetable vendor said.

"Yes. After the Beginning of Spring, it really is spring." The other vegetable vendor replied.

They quickly walked past.

"Spring has arrived," "Isn't this warm and bright weather spring?" I slowed my pace, walking and thinking softly.

Straight through from Danshui Road is Rue Say Zoong, and from Rue Say Zoong, you are on Avenue Joffre. Neat and tidy trees stand upright on both sides of the road, leaving behind some withered leaves and branches after winter. Across the street, I could see a few people climbing on the trees from afar. What were they doing up the trees? As I approached, I realized that they were there to prune the trees. This was public service. They slowly used small geared knives and large shears to cut off the dead branches and leaves on the trees, and then used some pine oil to coat the newly exposed branch ends. I heard that this serves two purposes: one is protection, and the other is to make the color of the newly exposed white branch ends the same as the tree trunk.

The newly cut branches were snatched up by people who bought them for three yuan and five jiao per dan.

Children picked up the branches on the ground, you hitting me, I hitting him, he hitting you, everyone chasing and making noise.

Right at the entrance of a lane turning at the side of the road, a little boy was sunbathing, and was practicing "physical sunbathing". Leaning against the corner of the wall, he took off the only piece of clothing he had on and was catching "Little Monkey Kings" with flapping sounds.

I only learned about "Little Monkey Kings" from a little boy today, because I just heard him saying, "Little Monkey King, where are you escaping to!" Then, he stuffed his right hand into his mouth, and the "Little Monkey King" entered the "Buddha's" mouth.

Has spring really arrived? Yes, spring is coming to the world.

### Sigh of the Night

— Lin Hao

### Lamp

— Shui Rong

The lamp gradually brightened.

It was not a big lamp, with a circumference of barely a foot, and it was so commonplace! The transparent glass shade nakedly revealed the small, wooden candlestick. Its maker seemed to be stingy with ingenuity, unwilling to show off his skills, and did not add a single flower or a stroke of color.

But therefore, this lamp with a small red candle burning inside radiated a different kind of brilliance.

I carried the small lamp, running back and forth. Wherever I ran, the darkness quickly retreated. Then, the firelight illuminated everything and comforted everything.

I seemed to feel that I was that fire, that light.

I stretched the lamp under the bed. The halo also illuminated this dark corner. Suddenly, a scratching sound, — something small scurried across the back of my foot.

A mouse!

I smiled knowingly.

I don't know when humans started lighting lamps. The Greeks say that Prometheus was chained to a high mountain to suffer the torment of eagles forever for stealing fire from heaven for humans. We not only got cooked food, but also could light lamps. With lamps, we no longer have to grope in the dim ignorance, and life becomes radiant and no longer muddled and lacking brilliance. What a brilliant help lamps have given to the progress of mankind!

Of course, there are also many who hate lamps. This mouse is one of them. That's because the lamp exposes its sneaky deeds. If it could use violence, it would put out the lamp.

I held the lamp tightly. Looking at it was interesting. First, a spark of fire, gradually becoming brilliant. The cyan flame stretched out peacefully and joyfully, as if to engulf all the surrounding darkness. And the entire life of this red candle seemed to exist only for generating heat and emitting light... Even in the last moment, it burst out with brilliant sparks, revealing constant struggle and fighting!

Please raise your lamps high. They will illuminate the night sky like thousands of stars, because people are so unfamiliar and unaccustomed to the night and the darkness!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

As other guests were invited up to speak, Yuan Baofan's eyes rolled more vigorously over the faces of the female students. By the time the guest's speech was over, and Governor Wang had handed out dozens of graduation diplomas, he had also familiarized himself with the face of every relatively attractive young woman. Just as he was using his brain, which was adept at doing evil, to try to think of a wicked idea that could immediately satisfy his desires, he suddenly heard the old man standing in the corner shout in a hoarse voice: "Student representative to deliver a thank-you speech." Then, a tall and graceful female student without makeup stepped out from the seventh row.

Before Luo Xiangqi's body had even settled on the stage, Yuan Zhen Song's senses were already half-numb. If Military Governor Hu had been a little slower to nudge him with his elbow, warning him not to do anything rash, he would at least have used his gifted voice to shout out "Bravo!" Because for him, schools and theaters were no different!

Beforehand, Luo Xiangqi had prepared a thank-you speech. Walking onto the stage, she held a piece of white paper in her hand and slowly recited it in a very crisp voice.

The silver bell-like voice struck Yuan Baofan's eardrums one after another, making him feel itchy from the bottom of his heart. His eyes were fixed on Luo Xiangqi's face. Her black hair, straight nose, shining eyes, slightly red lips, and white-yellowish complexion, as if carved from ivory, all firmly attracted his heart like a magnet. But in all of this, there was no trace of the seductive element he often saw, only like an unopened lotus flower offered before the Buddha's seat.

"Good brother, I can't read. Quickly, let me see what the girl's name is!" Yuan Baofan anxiously leaned into Military Governor Hu's ear and asked repeatedly.

"Her name isn't written on her body. Where do you expect me to look?" The person being asked immediately rebuffed him.

"Her name must be written on that list, right?" The Garrison Commander Yuan regarded the order list posted on the wall as the playbill in a theater, pointed to it with his finger, and repeatedly asked Military Governor Hu. (28)

### Inside the New City God Temple

— Yuting

Heaps and heaps of heads burrowed into the City God Temple, forming a tide-like crowd. The crowding, wriggling, and clamor were no different from the old City God Temple.

The main hall was packed with devout men and women, burning incense and lighting candles to communicate with the gods and offer prayers. They, at this moment, shared a similar selfish heart, which was to seek the blessing of the Bodhisattva. Waves of heat came from inside the hall, making it feel like standing next to a furnace. No wonder the City God Bodhisattva's face has been particularly rosy these past few days.

The seats in the dim sum shops, clearly marked as such, were all occupied. Diners chatted and laughed, while also paying attention to the hustle and bustle outside the shop. One batch had not yet left, and another was already preparing to grab seats. The busyness of the business made the waiters feel overwhelmed, truly unable to keep up.

Various kinds of lanterns, competing for beauty and novelty, were hung in the shops, and even the alleyways were filled with red and green ones, vying for the favor of tourists. Exquisite toys were displayed on stalls and in glass cabinets. The variety was so great that they had to be hung by ropes, trying to attract people's attention as much as possible. Children, passing by the toy shops, lingered reluctantly, clamoring to buy something. Only when they had one or two items in their hands did they leave, skipping and playing. Otherwise, they would pout, and some would even shed tears. It all depended on the adults' ability to deceive the children.

Selling fake jewelry was also a characteristic of the City God Temple market. Just talking about rings worth two jiao each, the variety of settings was enough to dazzle you. The craftsmanship was so good that it was almost indistinguishable from the real thing, with jadeite, agate, diamonds… but unfortunately, they were all fake. Several rows of customers stood in front of the shops, selecting, trying them on, and curiosity and the desire for a bargain drew coins from their purses.

The place was much smaller than the old City God Temple, and it was soon possible to walk around it in a circle. The tourists outside continued to squeeze in. The liveliness enticed people not to leave, and prosperity occupied everyone's heart. Squid, toys, and rings still sucked out the money hidden in pockets like magnets. Who ever bothered to discern what kind of goods these were? Who ever thought about the people on the starvation line outside the temple?

Stepping out of the temple gate, three or four young street wanderers, piled on top of each other, trying to grab the hydrogen balloons flying under the eaves of the temple gate. A small, thin one rushed forward, and everyone fell in a heap.

"Two jiao each!" The shouts clung to their mouths repeatedly. The pain of the fall and the danger were minor matters to them.

New Film Introduction

### "Peacock's Pride"

— Sang Min

This play, originally named "Pride and Prejudice", is a story that expresses human emotions. If the audience can appreciate it with a calm mind, it will be a rather excellent work. The screenplay is adapted from a novel. The director, Leonard, is known for producing films starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. However, apart from "Bitter Sweet", there are no other plays that are truly popular and deeply ingrained in people's hearts.

The theme has plenty of satire but lacks vigor. The humor of the British gentleman cannot be required to have any thorough meaning. The story unfolds in British feudal society, in an old family that emphasizes pedigree. Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Bennet lead their five unmarried daughters in eagerly seeking to marry into aristocratic families. After some light and interesting ripples, each marries a wealthy and capable husband.

The characters focus on Elizabeth, the eldest daughter played by Greer Garson, and Mr. Darcy, the aristocratic young man played by Laurence Olivier. One has the arrogant air of an aristocrat, and the other has the prejudice of resentment and revenge. They are ultimately able to discard arrogance and prejudice and see the love in their hearts. However, this love is still built on the gentleman system. For example, the section on spending money to bring people together is not as insightful in its explanation of love as the American perspective.

Both leading actors are typical excellent actors. Garson excels in gentleness and beauty, while Olivier has a strong and forceful air. They have a firm grasp of the characters in the play, which is naturally what one would expect. The other roles, such as Edmund Gwenn as Mr. Bennet, Mary Boland as Mrs. Bennet, Ann Revere as Lady Catherine, and Maureen O'Sullivan as the second daughter Jane, are also played very well.

The director and screenplay both develop from the perspective of human sentiment. The unreasonableness of aristocratic society and feudal society is limited to satire, with no intention of negation. The technique is quite delicate, focusing on small details, which is an unavoidable method for human sentiment plays. This film is well made. At least, compared to the same director's recent work "New Moon", it shows more skill.

### A New Understanding of Confucius - First Place in the High School Division - Yao Guozhen, Senior 3, Guanghua Affiliated High School

Confucius, this prophet of mankind, warrior in the darkness, and model for all ages!

"Rectify the heart, be sincere in intentions, cultivate oneself, regulate the family, govern the state, and bring peace to the world. Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace are the foundations for a great man to establish himself." What was correct two thousand years ago is still correct today, two thousand years later. Pushing it forward billions of years, the brilliance of this truth becomes more and more apparent! The Master spoke of benevolence and righteousness and advocated peace, which is known to all. However, his fighting spirit of eliminating violence and suppressing evil, supporting the weak and small, resisting aggression, and refusing to yield until death is still neglected by the general public. It is truly necessary to have a new understanding.

Peace cannot be enjoyed through complacency or achieved through simple appeasement. One must have the determination to not compromise, not yield, and seek peace through war in order to strive for true peace. The Master certainly did not like war, but he was not afraid of war either. He even strongly advocated the righteous battle of sacrificing oneself for benevolence and giving up one's life for righteousness. Benevolence and love are the goal, and wisdom and courage are the means. The few brutal oppressors in the world are the obstacles to peace, the public enemies of mankind, and also the great enemies of the Master!

Look! His words and deeds throughout his life were all for the sake of justice and humanity. Traveling around the states, embarking on a journey of thousands of miles, he fought against rebellious ministers and traitors. Writing "The Analects" and composing "The Spring and Autumn Annals," he verbally and in writing condemned the cruel enemy without stopping. Before his death, he earnestly told his disciples who had not yet died, "After my death, there will be you; after your death, there will be thousands upon thousands of descendants." Each word, each tear, shook the hearts of every descendant of the Yellow Emperor!

Listen to him sing: "The mountains and fields are vast, the grass is withered and yellow, running around in all directions, staying in the cold wilderness, eliminating all traitors and chasing away jackals and wolves." With such great spirit and firm will, who can deny that he is not a warrior in the darkness? Therefore, the true spirit of Confucianism does not lie in quiet study but in dynamic practice. Studying "The Four Books" and lecturing on "The Five Classics," being skilled in the Master's learning with a pen, and having conversations filled with the ways of ancient sages and philosophers, for those who keep themselves pure, this is only recognizing the passive side. Only those who can transform the Master's words into actions, uphold the integrity of loyalty to the country, and inherit his spirit of supporting the weak and eliminating violence are worthy of being called believers of Confucianism in the new China and are the new youth that China needs. Remember: the Master was not a weak scholar, not an academic who engaged in empty talk, and even less a pedantic idol as commonly imagined. He was a planner with a practical mind, a great patriot, and even more so a vanguard against aggression!

If someone says that China lacks an inherent religion, then undoubtedly, the Master is our great teacher. Striving for the freedom and independence of the motherland is the doctrine that we adhere to and strive to practice. The Master, along with Christ and Buddha, are all saviors of world peace and mankind. Our current war against aggression has implicitly inherited the Master's teachings. On the southeastern border and in the cold wilderness of the north, we have thousands upon thousands of Zilu, galloping across the battlefield, shedding hot blood, throwing away their heads, treading on the bloodstains of the martyrs, vowing to fight to the death and bring peace. The reason why our Chinese nation has not perished and why our culture is immortal lies in this! It lies in this!

Our new and correct understanding of the Master can further strengthen our belief in eliminating violence and suppressing evil. Belief generates strength. It is the new understanding and new belief of 440 million people, this unparalleled great force, that will surely propel the new China onto the bright road!

### Scattered Notes from the Art World

— Shou Wu

Since the New Art Troupe performed "Heroes of the Sea," Kuang Mo has been quiet for several months. Recently, he has been preparing for a spring performance. The script has been decided to be Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables."

After Wang Yin directed "Country Girl," because the business was quite good, he was very interested in "doing it again." Xinhua has also agreed, and the date for filming should not be far away. It is heard that the script has also been finalized as an ancient costume film, "Fighting Taiping."

In addition, the play that Wang Yin is privately funding is also actively underway. The script has been decided on as a modern drama, titled "The Soul Returns to Hate Heaven." However, this "The Soul Returns to Hate Heaven" has a different plot from the foreign film "The Soul Returns to Hate Heaven." The only thing that is the same is the title. In terms of actors, Wang Yin is quite keen on inviting Liu Qiong to play the male lead and Yuan Meiyun to co-star.

There is a rumor that Zhang Yuan will publicly sell tickets to allow movie fans to visit the filming. This is actually just a rumor because the actors may not be willing to agree. Moreover, too many visitors during actual filming would cause many inconveniences.

It is heard that Minhua's "Song of Ancient China" includes many Peking operas, and "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan" is only one of them.

### "Red Plum Troupe" Performance "The Liberation of Women"

Tomorrow (Thursday), the Lafayette Theatre will be hosting two shows, day and night, of "The Liberation of Women" performed by the "Red Plum Troupe." Starting on the 10th, they will continue to perform "Home." The "Red Plum Troupe" is a new and unique troupe, composed of amateur theater people who are passionate and interested in drama, especially women in freelance professions. It is heard that this performance is purely voluntary and is being performed to raise funds for the women's volunteer supplementary school. "The Liberation of Women" is directed by Mr. Hu Dao. The female lead is a female lawyer who speaks very fluent Beijing dialect. She is enthusiastic about voluntary education and advocates for the liberation of women, speaking from her own experience. Famous Shanghai theater actors such as Li Bangzuo, Wang Jixu, Dai Yun, and Yao Zhai are assisting in the performance. It is truly a grand event in the theatrical world.
