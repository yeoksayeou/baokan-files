Fierce battles are believed to be ongoing. The number of reinforcements is not yet known. American forces in the seven cities of the province of Tarlac have already withdrawn. According to a report from the governor of the province of Tayabas, the vanguard of the Japanese army has reached a certain location, and the military is using explosives to destroy bridges and roads to impede the Japanese advance.

London, December 27th, Reuters: (Rebroadcasting from Chongqing) The Japanese army's pincer threat to Manila, the capital of the Philippines, is intensifying daily. Japanese troop transport fleets are continuously importing large numbers of troops to the northern and eastern coasts.

Manila's Demilitarized Status; Japan Clarifies its Position

Manila, December 27th, Havas: Official sources have announced that starting today, no more trains will depart from Manila. The government authorities have taken this measure to avoid civilian casualties due to Japanese bombing of the railways.

Tokyo, December 28th, Domei News Agency: A spokesman for the Army Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today that the Japanese forces on Luzon have rejected the declaration designating Manila as a demilitarized city. The spokesman said that the actions of the Japanese forces in the Philippines will not be restricted by such unilateral notifications and will proceed with the steps deemed necessary in the course of the war. The spokesman also pointed out that the vicinity of Manila contains important military and naval facilities, but the actions of the Japanese forces will be limited to attacking military targets. Filipinos, Americans, and non-combatants currently residing in Manila must evacuate to two locations near the city designated by the Japanese command: Antipolo and Montalban. These two towns are easily accessible from Manila, and civilians seeking refuge there will receive proper treatment upon the arrival of the Japanese forces. The spokesman further stated that the Japanese forces will cease attacks until the American forces formally surrender.

Tokyo, December 28th, Haitian Press: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Army Department today commented that the American announcement of Manila as a demilitarized city was entirely a unilateral action by the United States because the Japanese government has not received formal notification. However, Japanese forces in the Philippines have taken various measures to spare Manila's citizens from the ravages of war. Japanese aircraft only bomb military targets and harbor facilities and drop leaflets ordering citizens to evacuate. The American claim that Japanese aircraft bombed schools, hospitals, and churches is false. This is an American attempt to induce American nations to declare war on Japan.

Bangkok, December 28th, Haitian Press: According to reports received here today, six hours after General MacArthur, commander of the US Far East forces, declared Manila a demilitarized city, Manila lost its aspect as a military center.

Currently, battles on both the northern and southern fronts are fierce, especially in the province of Tayabas in the southeast. Fierce tank battles are occurring. The day Manila was declared a demilitarized city was the day the Japanese aircraft most fiercely bombed the city. The city was bombed all day long, especially the waterfront. The "Bicol" of the Madrigal Shipping Company slowly sank at the bombed pier, indicating it was scuttled. The police ordered all ships to move away yesterday morning, but because of the shallow tide, most were still docked at the pier. Ipoh evacuates women and children

### Germany's Attention Focused on Turkey, Spain, and Portugal; Though Bā Běn Provides Assurances, Turkey's Vigilance Has Not Been Relaxed

Bern, December 27th, Havas: Since German Führer Hitler recently took over as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and issued a statement to the soldiers, speculation has been rampant, and there have been many unfounded rumors. The Führer said that Germany would soon take decisive military action, and the Soviet war would become a war of position. People are paying particular attention to this statement. A Basel newspaper correspondent in Berlin recently wrote a lengthy dispatch discussing Germany's future military actions. The article extensively cites an article recently published in the country's "Labor Front Magazine" by Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy. According to the article, German workers have built vast defenses along the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean in the past year and a half, so the coastal defenses are now as solid as a rock. Several coastal ports have steel and concrete submarine bases to protect submarines from air raids. Therefore, the correspondent believes that Berlin's attention is now focused on the Mediterranean, especially Portugal, Spain, and Turkey. As far as Portugal is concerned, since Britain and the Netherlands jointly occupied Portuguese Timor, Prime Minister Salazar issued a statement condemning it. Although the German Foreign Ministry stated at the time that the Portuguese issue had been relegated to a secondary position, it did not consider Prime Minister Salazar's statement to be a decision on the country's relations with Britain. This is one point. As for Spain, the German Foreign Ministry has repeatedly denied various rumors and called them malicious, but recently British aircraft bombed German ships docked in a Spanish port. Spanish Foreign Minister Suña is currently hunting in a certain location, so it is still unclear what position the Spanish government will take on this incident. However, it can be asserted that the German government is paying close attention to this incident. This is the second point. As for Turkey, according to a report from the National Daily correspondent in Turkey's capital, Führer Hitler's takeover as Commander-in-Chief of the Army has deeply impressed Turkish political figures. Turkish public opinion generally believes that major changes will occur soon. Although German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen recently gave assurances to Turkish President İnönü, their nature is not sufficient to relax Turkey's vigilance regarding the future of the war. Therefore, although the Soviet front is currently experiencing heavy snow and extreme cold, people in Turkey's capital are paying more and more attention to the war there. This is the third point.

### German Aircraft Active in the Arctic Ocean and the Black Sea; Soviet Forces Intensify Counterattacks

Berlin, December 27th, Havas: An official communiqué has been issued stating that German aircraft have repeatedly flown to the Arctic Ocean and the Black Sea to bomb Soviet naval targets with considerable success.

Führer's Headquarters, December 28th, Haitian Press: This afternoon, a German military report stated that enemy forces in the southern sector of Eastern Europe had broken into our lines, but the Allied forces of Germany, Italy, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, and Slovakia bravely fought back and ultimately repelled the Soviet forces.

Three enemy transport ships (2,800 tons) in the Kerch Strait were sunk, and one gunboat and four other types of ships were damaged.

That unit has been attacked by British forces, and British mobile artillery has entered a position where it can bombard the road between Zeda Biah and Benghazi. Clearing operations are currently underway in both areas, but because the area is too large, it will take some time.

### Washington Meetings Held for Days Discussing Current War Strategies, Roosevelt Says Important Results Obtained, Meetings Continue, Content Not Announced

The first meeting began at 10:00 AM and only concerned the United States. Representatives from all countries attended the remaining meetings. The representative from Norway was also present.

### British House of Commons to Discuss South Pacific Issue, Importance of Pacific Cannot Be Underestimated, Military and Diplomatic Considerations Must Be Re-examined

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Reuters) - According to well-informed sources in Britain, members of the House of Commons will raise several questions regarding the Pacific after the Christmas break. London believes that events in Europe are more important than the Pacific, but it cannot ignore the possibility that the United States may halt supplies to Europe due to the Pacific situation. Therefore, Britain cannot underestimate the importance of the Pacific, especially the strength of Japan. Some members of parliament do not want to condemn the government for failing to make adequate preparations in the Far East. The United States also believes that Britain has made preparations in the Far East, as evidenced by the dispatch of two large battleships to Singapore. Other members blame the government's incompetence and unintentional blunders, with inappropriate measures taken in both military and diplomatic fields. Officials in Singapore believed early on that Thailand could not defend itself. Regarding the criticism of the fall of Hong Kong, it is said that if Kowloon had not been abandoned first, Hong Kong could have been defended. However, defending Kowloon required assistance from China. Britain had no solid defense for Kowloon, and its disputes with Chongqing only ended after withdrawing from Kowloon. All of these factors suggest that the island's loss was inevitable. As for the defense of Singapore, it relied solely on the navy and so-called impregnable forts, but paid no attention to attacks from land and air. Therefore, the airfield there had no defensive equipment, and the railway linking Thailand was not destroyed. The above is the reason for the loss of two large battleships and Penang. The Japanese army now has control of the Molucca Strait, and Rangoon and the Burma Road are threatened.

The Times Comments on the War Situation

London, 28th (Havas) - The Times commented on the Pacific war situation today, stating that the loss of many airfields in Malaya and the sinking of two battleships should be attributed to the inadequacy of our air force strength. The fact that more than a hundred Japanese transport ships were able to land fully loaded with soldiers indicates this as well. The free movement of these transport ships is truly alarming. If we had reconnaissance aircraft, we should have detected their movements before they set out. Once they had set out, squadrons of torpedo bombers, protected by fighter planes, would have been enough to inflict heavy damage on them. However, the actions of these troop transports were as if they were entering an unguarded territory, indicating that both Britain and the United States were completely unprepared. There are too few planes to cover our land and naval operations, which is particularly noteworthy. The reason for this is likely that the importance of the war in other theaters has exhausted our strength. In this new theater of war, the air force of the Dutch East Indies is well-equipped and highly skilled. Although it is not as numerous as our air force in other theaters, it plays an important role in the Pacific. Therefore, the serious threat to the Philippines is particularly unfavorable. Especially after the fall of [missing text], the Japanese can directly bomb the Dutch air force bases in Borneo and Java from the airfield there. However, we must admit that the United States is potentially the strongest country in the world, and its current situation is exactly the same as our situation in 1939. It takes time to put air force units into a state of war. In view of the development of the war situation, we have increasingly focused on protecting airfields. We must quickly replenish all air force bases in Australia, the Dutch East Indies, India, the Near East, and the British mainland, based on the lessons learned in Malaya and the Philippines.

### All Eight Major Rice Warehouses Have Been Opened, More Low-Priced Rice Shops Should Be Added, Only One-Tenth of the Over 800 Rice Shops in the Two Settlements Have Received Imported Rice

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office has designated rice shops to pick up imported rice from the Longmao Warehouse on Chengdu Road. Although yesterday was Sunday, the warehouses opened as usual to distribute rice to retailers. However, the Bank of China's warehouse will open today to distribute rice. In addition, the Taikoo Warehouse will also open today, as some rice shops have applied to move rice that is still designated to be picked up from the Taikoo Warehouse. As for the rice remaining in the Xinyuan and Maotai warehouses, it will be temporarily

Not Implemented for Low-Priced Sale When Wet

Also, a reporter from the Da Dao News Agency obtained an unofficial message that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee, in order to prevent retailers from reselling for profit, should wet the rice before granting it to the public at retail. However, some parties have expressed disagreement, believing that as the retail quantity cannot be increased, this measure would only increase the difficulties of the retail civilians. Therefore, this matter is unlikely to be implemented. As for the method of scientifically stamping each retail crowd, it is also considered by the rice shops to be unreliable and is currently shelved.

Too Few Low-Priced Rice Shops

When selling at retail, the rice shops still use white powder to write numbers on the arms of each retailer. The queue is monitored by constables to prevent crowding. The underage and elderly are often assisted by constables or helped with purchases, so the order is slightly better. It has been found that there are 500 rice shops in the International Settlement and 320 in the French Concession. Only one-tenth of them have applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council to receive imported rice for sale. It is no wonder that the retail crowds are so crowded. Therefore, unless it is possible to have rice shops sell universally, it is difficult to expect the current crowding phenomenon to disappear.

Increasing Supply of National and Imported Rice

It is now understood that the authorities have instructed their subordinates to handle the procedures for registering, paying for, and delivering imported rice fairly, and to provide convenience to legitimate rice merchants. As for the rice warehouses that have been approved by the Japanese side to open for delivery, there are already eight major Chinese and foreign rice warehouses, including Taikoo, Roosevelt, Xinyuan Maotai China, and Longmao. It is said that the above eight warehouses store the most food, with the amount of imported rice reaching more than 30 million bags. According to the current rice distribution channels, it can supply two months of needs. The Japanese side has also continued to open the remaining food warehouses, so there is no fear of interruption in the distribution of imported rice by rice shops in the future. According to rice merchants, national rice has been continuously transported to Shanghai in the past week, and small retailers in the urban area have formed groups, totaling no less than 100,000 stones.

Still Extremely Difficult to Obtain Flour for Cakes and Steamed Buns

The Cake and Steamed Bun Industry Association has recently seen an increasing number of businesses closing down due to the difficulty of purchasing flour in the market. Members of the association have repeatedly requested the association to continue to supply low-priced flour to the settlement authorities to alleviate business difficulties and the people's suffering. The association has now sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, requesting that they issue low-priced flour as much as possible. It also appealed to all sectors, stating that the products of our cake and steamed bun industry are essential daily food for the city's civilians. In mid-October, when the price of flour exceeded 37 yuan, we dared to first request the Shanghai Municipal Council to continue to regulate the people's food supply and maintain low prices, and issued two notices to maintain the original price to reduce the burden on customers. On the 5th of this month, thanks to the Shanghai Municipal Council's consideration of business difficulties, 1,500 bags of low-priced flour were approved and distributed to members for use at the prescribed price. At that time, the industry was able to barely survive and maintain business for three to four days. But three weeks have passed since then, and members' desire for flour is like a precious treasure. The association's efforts to request assistance have encountered difficulties, so that the lives of more than 300 cake and steamed bun shops in the city are on the verge of extinction, and the daily food supply of civilians is in imminent danger. If this continues to spread, it will have a profound impact on society. We hope that flour warehouses at sea and the settlement authorities will continue to provide supplies. We are very grateful."

### Gunshots Fired by Bandits on Rue de la Gare, Robberies Rampant Throughout the Day Yesterday

Xu Xiaokang, from Pudong, who runs a laundry shop, was walking near the intersection of Rue de la Gare and Rue Henri in the French Concession at around 8:00 PM last night when he suddenly encountered bandits who robbed him. Xu immediately shouted for help, angering the bandits, who drew a gun and opened fire on him, hitting Xu's left chest. The bullet did not exit, and he fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The bandits fled upon seeing that they had caused trouble. Later, nearby Chinese constables arrived and sent him to Kwong Chiu Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries are extremely serious and his life is in danger.

At 10:10 PM last night, a man was walking near Boone Road and Park Road when he was robbed by four bandits. One bandit drew a gun and robbed him of a leather overcoat and a robe, worth a total of 1,700 yuan in legal tender.

In front of No. 7, Lane 764, Haines Road, a pedestrian was robbed of more than 60 yuan in legal tender by two armed bandits.

At around 5:00 PM yesterday, a man was walking near Haines Road when he was stopped by two bandits. One bandit drew a gun to threaten him and robbed him of an overcoat worth 400 yuan in silver dollars.

### Four Measures for Citizens to Relocate

Regarding the relocation of citizens, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai issued an emergency notice today (29th), stating: 1. Anyone who wishes to move from outside the Japanese military cordon line around Shanghai into the cordon line must obtain permission from the local Japanese military police. 2. Regarding the relocation of residents within the Japanese military cordon line area, if anyone wishes to move from areas outside the French Concession and the Public Settlement (but including the Public Settlement area east of North Henan Road and north of Suzhou Creek) into the French Concession and the Public Settlement area (but not including the Public Settlement area east of North Henan Road and north of Suzhou Creek), or from the French Concession and the Public Settlement area (but not including the Public Settlement area east of North Henan Road and north of Suzhou Creek) to outside the French Concession and the Public Settlement area (but including the Public Settlement area east of North Henan Road and north of Suzhou Creek), they must also obtain permission from the local Japanese military police. 3. Anyone who violates the above two items will be severely punished by military law. In addition, anyone who informs the Japanese army of violations of the preceding two provisions will be given an appropriate reward. 4. Anyone who wishes to move out of the Japanese military cordon line to a place outside the cordon line, the Japanese army should allow them freedom.

### Temporary Search Conducted on Avenue Edward VII Last Night, Reason for Caution: Pawnshop Robbed of Over 60,000 Yuan, Police Investigated and Arrested Bandits, Shops Closed Down

The Shenzhen Fa Pawnshop at No. 123 Ba Li Qiao Street in the French Concession, which is operated by Zheng Guangren from Chaozhou, Guangdong, was suddenly entered by six bandits at around 3:00 PM yesterday. The bandits pulled out items and took advantage of the opportunity to break into the shop hall. Two bandits drew handguns to prevent any noise, driving all the staff into a room, where one bandit guarded them with a gun. Three bandits searched everywhere, resulting in the robbery of a large amount of

Cash and Clothing

Worth about more than 60,000 yuan. The bandits wrapped all the stolen goods in cloth, carried them away, and fled. The proprietor immediately reported the incident. The police sent detectives to investigate and cut off traffic along Avenue Edward VII from Rue Montigny to San Mao Ge Bridge with wire mesh, searching passing pedestrians. The situation was quite tense for a while. Nearby shops, unaware of what was happening,

Closed Down One After Another

After learning about the robbery, they immediately opened their doors and resumed business as usual, but were already badly frightened. A staff member of the pawnshop, Tang Binglong, 22 years old, from Guangdong, offered slight resistance and was stabbed in the left thigh with a sharp knife by the bandits. The wound was very deep, and blood flowed profusely. He was sent to Kwong Chiu Hospital for treatment by the police. Four customers were also tied up with ropes by the bandits and dragged into the room.

Statement by the Chief of the Reporting Department

Regarding the relocation of citizens and their return to their hometowns in the above-mentioned area, the Chief of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai issued the following statement: Regarding the relocation of citizens and their return to their hometowns in the Shanghai area, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai has already issued a notice today. Although certain restrictions have been imposed on those who move from areas outside the Japanese military cordon line around Shanghai into the cordon line, and when residents within the cordon line move their residences, the main purpose is none other than to ensure peace and order within the Shanghai area. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities have no intention of restricting those who wish to leave the two settlements and other places within the Japanese military cordon line for the purpose of returning to their hometowns. That is, even if those returning to their hometowns do not have a certificate of proof, the Japanese military authorities will, of course, not restrict or prohibit the household property they move out, as long as it is within a reasonable scope. If anyone wants to apply for a permit to return to their hometowns to avoid misunderstandings, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, or the Japanese Consulate General can issue it at any time. It should also be noted that the provisions of item 4 of the notice only apply to Chinese people and do not apply to foreigners. Furthermore, the Japanese military cordon line has two types: an outer perimeter cordon line and an inner perimeter cordon line. The cordon line referred to in this notice is the outer perimeter cordon line around Shanghai, that is, the ring from Xiangyin Road, Shuidian Road, Zhongshan Road, Zongjiazhai to Longhua Ferry, Huangpu River along Pudong Road to Nantaojia Ran, crossing the river to Xiangyin Road.

### Three Teachings Morality Society Maintains Winter Relief

Since the drastic changes in the international situation, charitable organizations have continued to work hard on relief work, but due to the difficulty of obtaining supplies, they feel that their efforts are not enough. The Shanghai Three Teachings Morality Charity Association continues to supply porridge and rice tickets for donations from all sectors, and also requests rice in accordance with the law, so that the association's 20 food distribution centers can continue to distribute food. All clothing tickets are also sold at a reduced price of 13 yuan in national currency per set. However, the 200 registered hidden poor households and 60 widowed and orphaned households have experienced extreme difficulties in obtaining supplies since the interruption of rice and wheat from the American Red Cross, and the suffering of the hidden poor is even greater than before. Therefore, it is hoped that benevolent people from all walks of life will generously adopt them. When adopting, you can inspect the registration book at the association's office and choose in person. The association's office is located at No. 10, Hongyun Villa, Lane 71, Jing'an Temple Road, telephone 91067.

### Purchasing Low-Priced Rice and Reselling for Profit

Recently, due to the lack of imported rice, the amount of imported rice obtained by various rice shops from the Shanghai Municipal Council's warehouse is not much. It is sold at low prices to the market to help the poor. Those who go to buy it are extremely crowded, with each person queuing for several hours before being able to buy three liters of low-priced rice. The elderly, infirm, and young children are unable to buy this low-priced rice. Currently, there are strong young idlers who take advantage of the opportunity to go to various rice shops to buy rice first and then sell it to others for profit. Each time they can get at least four or five yuan for a peck of low-priced rice. At around 7:00 AM the other day, Wu Atai, a Shaoxing native of this kind, bought six liters of low-priced rice at a rice shop near Gordon Road and Changping Road, totaling 8 yuan and 10 cents. After a while, while selling it to an old woman for 10 yuan, he was spotted by patrolman No. 633 of the Third District Police. He was arrested and taken to the police station along with a bag of low-priced rice. The police sent him to the Special Court No. 1 the day before. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the process, stating that the defendant took the opportunity to profit from this, and requested an investigation. After questioning by Judge Zhan, he was ordered to be detained and await sentencing.

### Some Foreign Firms Prepare to Close Down

The suspension of overseas transportation has had the greatest impact on the import and export industry. The business of various import and export foreign firms has almost completely stopped. Looking ahead, it is difficult to recover in the short term. Some foreign firms will implement layoffs or prepare to close down at the end of this month. In addition, various industries that rely solely on exports, such as peppermint manufacturing, bakelite manufacturing, egg industry, tea industry, lace industry, thermos bottle industry, glass industry, toy industry, antique industry, knitting industry, and towel industry, have all been severely hit. Sales have been cut off, and they have reduced work to weather the crisis.

### Shanghai's Commerce Must Still Be Maintained, and Will Be Resupplied from the Mainland

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury published a prediction by the famous economist Annahneng on the future of commerce in the city. The general idea is that Shanghai will welcome the New Year this week with an unprecedented situation. In the more than 100-year history of Shanghai as an international business center, it has never been as isolated as it is today. Business in the city has never been as controlled as it is now, and merchants in the city have never encountered such difficulties, needing to work hard to adapt to the ever-changing environment in order to maintain their business.

Business Must Still Be Conducted

It is difficult for us to say whether the coming year will bring us peace or whether the world will still be at war in the next twelve months. If the war does not end, the future situation will remain turbulent and uncertain. However, business in the city can hardly sit and wait for the situation to clear up. We must continue to maintain it, because the business of the city is not only to supply the food, clothing, and housing of 4 million residents, but also to manage industries worth billions of dollars in investment, and the culmination of more than 100 years of economic innovation and improvement in the Far East. Shanghai has large-scale industrial facilities, easy transportation, and financial facilities, so no matter how the situation changes, Shanghai will still be the key to business in the Far East.

No Need to Overly Worry about Controls

There are still many difficult problems to be solved, but it is hoped that they can be solved one by one. The authorities' control of rice, flour, soybean oil, fat, and coal is all aimed at using these items economically and distributing them fairly. The authorities' management of hundreds of items has limited most major daily necessities to reasonable prices. The implementation of this control and management is the first time in Shanghai. Merchants in the city have tried their best to oppose this kind of measure in the past. Even today, there are still those who are dissatisfied with this kind of measure. However, this attitude is not necessary. Private business should be based on public interest. In the future, there will be more and more control measures. In fact, this kind of measure has been implemented in other parts of the world for a long time, and we don't need to make a fuss about it.

The Mainland Can Provide Resupply

Relying only on Shanghai's current inventory is not enough to stabilize business in the city for a long time. Except for mineral oil, Shanghai's inventory of major items is quite abundant. However, if there is no continuous resupply, then the various commodities will eventually run out. Considering the current Pacific war situation and the difficulty of shipping, Shanghai's imported goods will all be taken from the Chinese mainland. The Japanese side is quite willing to allow Shanghai to obtain necessary goods from the mainland. Soon, Shanghai will be able to obtain this resupply from the mainland, especially coal. Shanghai will restore the trade situation before the Sino-Japanese War. Shanghai's position has not reached the point of seeking help everywhere. If food, fuel, and raw materials can be continuously supplied, then Shanghai's manufacturing industry can still produce a large number of industrial products to meet the urgent needs of the mainland." Another line of the Hongkou tram.

### Another Tram Line in Hongkou to Resume Service Tomorrow: From Waibaidu Bridge to Yangshupu

The Hongkou tram, after first resuming service on the line from Waibaidu Bridge to Yokohama Bridge (formerly Route 11, with a total of seven trams running), has been delayed in resuming service on the line from Waibaidu Bridge to Yangshupu (formerly Route 2) due to repairs to the tracks and electrical fees. According to a *Datong* reporter's inquiry, this tram line is scheduled to start operating at 6:00 AM tomorrow (the 30th), with an expected eleven trams running. The drivers will still be borrowed from the tram company, as the fifty new drivers recently transferred to the company for training have not yet mastered the driving skills. Female conductors will still be used for ticket sales.

### Abduction of a Young Girl: Mrs. Chen Deng's Trial Concluded, Awaiting Judgment

Mrs. Chen Deng, an elderly woman from Tongzhou residing in the attic at No. 4, Lane 98, Haizhou Road, allegedly lured Zhang Quan-sheng's fourteen-year-old daughter, Bao-di, a local resident and her landlord's daughter, on the street at around 3:00 PM on the thirteenth of this month to her relative's bungalow on Hejian Road. There, she falsely claimed that the girl's mother was having an affair and had been beaten bloody and driven out by her father, and was now staying somewhere in Badaitou. She instructed the girl to take her mother's clothes, some rice, and a loan of fifteen yuan to her. The young and naive girl believed her and did as she was told. The girl, a worker at the Honeycomb Woolen Yarn Factory on Guiyang Road, borrowed wages from the factory and went to her father Zhang Quan-sheng at the Shanghai Cotton Mill, but did not find him. Later, in the bungalow on Hejian Road, Chen Deng kept her under guard, forbidding her from leaving. Meanwhile, her husband, Chen Xiao-jin, tried to sell Zhang's daughter to others, but no employer was found. Zhang Quan-sheng, the girl's father, searched everywhere after his daughter went missing, finding no clues. Finally, the day before yesterday, he learned that his tenant, Chen Deng, was responsible. He reported the situation to the Yangshupu police station, who sent detectives to the address and arrested Mrs. Chen Deng, recovering Zhang's daughter from the bungalow on Hejian Road. They were both taken to the police station, and the day before yesterday, they were sent to the Special Court No. 1. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted her for abduction and disrupting the family, requesting investigation. Zhang's daughter then recounted the incident. When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive, claiming that her husband, who was at large, was responsible. Judge Zhan ordered her to be remanded in custody to await a suitable judgment.

### Plan to Suppress Speculative Behavior by Merchants: Centralized Trading

The surge in commodity prices has been contained, and the cost of living index has declined. Yesterday, it was learned that the authorities of the two concessions, recognizing the urgent need to rectify transactions in various industries in the city, otherwise speculative merchants will continue to be active, affecting price control efforts. They are now planning a centralized trading method, where merchants must conduct transactions in a central location. This would facilitate management and unify prices. If this plan can become a reality and be quickly implemented, speculation will disappear.

Cost of Living Index to be Published Soon

The cost of living index for workers in the city, previously compiled and published regularly by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession to facilitate employers in adjusting labor wages, has been increasing monthly this year, indicating that the surge in commodity prices, influenced by speculation, has not been contained. Yesterday, according to a source at the Industrial and Social Affairs Department, the department has completed compiling the cost of living index for Chinese workers and Western expatriates for this month, which will be published soon. According to the survey results, it has slightly decreased compared to last month.

### Various Soup Kitchen Groups Continue to Distribute Gruel in Western Shanghai Yesterday

Various soup kitchen groups in the city have been providing relief to disaster victims in the Jiesifei Road and Bailinan Road areas of western Shanghai for several days. In addition to each group contributing 200 yuan in gruel tickets, they have also received donations of gruel tickets from various philanthropists, including Yan Zhongli 900 yuan, Hu Jiaji Xiang 240 yuan, the Mingde Council 240 yuan, the Wei Zhong Shanzhang 240 yuan, Dai Yuemin 200 yuan, Mr. Lu 100 yuan, Wang Daolin 100 yuan, Fook Kee 100 yuan, Song Kee 200 yuan, De Sen Teacher 51 yuan, Ling Yicai 6 yuan, Hei Huo 6 yuan, and Layman Qiao 3 yuan, totaling 70,000 gruel tickets. All were distributed yesterday (the 28th) afternoon, and the disaster victims were extremely grateful. It is heard that the group believes that the disaster is severe and has passed, so this disaster relief will end last night.

Yesterday, the *Shen Bao* and *French Paper* at 6:15 PM

### Aurora University Middle School Football Match: Vatican Royal Beats Pujiang. Vince, Datong, and Nantong Win. Guangxia Loses Due to Incomplete Team

The Aurora University and Middle School Football League was held yesterday afternoon at the Aurora Stadium on Luban Road, including two groups of middle schools and four groups of universities. Xuhui defeated the Baptist League with a brand-new style, with a score of 1-0. In addition, Guangxia has had a remarkable record in the league, always maintaining an undefeated honor. Yesterday, because the entire team and elites attended the Little Football Match, only reserves were sent to the field, resulting in a loss to Datong with a score of 1-0. In the university group, Nantong beat Fazheng 5-1, Vince beat Dongya 1-0, Datong beat Daxia 1-0, Vatican Royal and Pujiang faced each other, with a wonderful performance. In the first half, each side tied with two goals. In the second half, Pujiang's stamina was insufficient, allowing the opponent to trample on them, and finally lost to Vatican Royal with a score of 3-5. Vatican Royal is now tied for first place with Aurora, with three wins in three games. The results of yesterday's games are as follows:

Xuhui won against Invasive Alliance (High School B) 1-0, Vince won against Asia (University) 1-0, Datong won against Guangxia (High School B) 1-0, Nantong won against Fazheng (University) 5-1, Datong won against Daxia (University) 1-0, Yiguang won against Hongxing, Ruilong lost to Lions' Voice.

### Little Football Trial Match Yesterday: Yiguang Wins Against Hongxing, Ruilong Loses to Lions' Voice

The Little Football Match, initiated by Wang Ruilong, was held yesterday at the Guangxia Stadium as a maiden trial. Yiguang beat Hongxing 2-1, Ruilong beat Lions' Voice Group B 2-1. Yesterday, thousands of spectators watched. At the beginning of the game, both sides felt inconvenient because it was the first trial kick, and the kicks were incompatible. Later, Wang Ruilong explained on the spot, and people started to get on track, using a smaller ball was simpler. Ruilong's Zhang Caide took the lead and scored a goal, and the first half ended. Lion's Voice's Ye Yi dragged his knife and split three circles, sweeping a goal into the ten-yard area. Before long, Ruilong's war flames rose again, and Xu Xisheng went deep alone, shooting fiercely from the right corner, starting, hitting the target. As a result, Ruilong beat Lions' Voice B 2-1. Yiguang and Hongxing took the stage. Hongxing's main general, He Jiatong, was absent from the battle, and the internal defense was lacking. Yiguang first broke through a city with Zhao Yongfang. Xiao Ziwen shot from the fifteen-yard line and pulled back a city. Each scored one goal in the first half, tying. In the sound of the rematch, Yiguang's Shen Jinda wore a hundred steps, cleverly hitting the bullseye. As a result, Yiguang overcame Hong Dian 2-1. A wonderful trial match ended.

Spring and Autumn

### Tattered Clothing Record

— Tutu

Shanghai only recognizes clothes, not people. When winter clothes are missing, you can't help but think of a solution. Wearing only a top without a winter coat is not presentable. People may not ridicule you to your face, but behind your back, they will inevitably mock you. The nickname "tin can" cannot be avoided. Looking at the pedestrians on the street, all with coats on their backs, I feel terrible inside. The movie screen advertisements repeatedly tell people, "Time To Think About Overcoat." Indeed, without straining my eyes, I already feel that it's time to add a coat.

Thanks to the experience of wandering on the streets, I have a firm memory of which store has which kind of thing that I like, so that once I have money in hand, I can get it with one search. So, in a desperate situation, I managed to get a sum of money and ran to the store that I had already secretly agreed on in my heart.

The second-hand stores on Xiafei Road, lined up like fish scales, have already been visited by me countless times. Lingering in the windows and memorizing the prices are all repeated again and again. This time, returning to the old place, with a hundred and several tens of yuan in my pocket, my courage suddenly grew. When the clerk came up to greet me, I felt that I was indeed a big buyer. Running into the store, the clerk was turning over cabinets and windows, selecting items. Taking advantage of this free time, I looked at other customers and clerks. I saw a young man with a Philippine-style banana head paying a deposit, totaling 300 yuan. I secretly peeked at the order, which included a coat, a raincoat, and a used suit, totaling 1,100 yuan. The number was intimidating, and my body immediately shrank by half. My tongue involuntarily stuck out twice, and my heart softened immediately. I decided that I wouldn't buy anything if it wasn't a bargain.

The clerk had already placed various coats on the glass counter, a total of three: a dark blue thick woolen coat, priced at 280 yuan; a gray hair woolen coat, priced at 560 yuan; and a Holmes Bon autumn-winter dual-purpose coat, priced at 380 yuan. At that time, I didn't commit, but just studied the texture. As a result, the brand-new one was the cheapest, and the oldest one was the most expensive. The so-called woolen coat felt like cotton fabric to the touch. Even if you haggled, if you got your wish and calculated it at half price, it would still cost 140 yuan. Sweeping all the money in my pocket was still not enough. I didn't like the goods, and I didn't have enough capital, so I had to say sorry and leave. Because I didn't look back, I didn't know what the clerk's expression was like.

I ran to several stores in a row, just listening to others haggle. After calmly observing, I could only afford a coachman's checkered used coat. So, I got angry and simply stopped lingering and jumped on a third-class tram back to my old home. My wife's illness was getting worse, so this money was righteously used for her medical expenses. I sat blankly with the patient for a while, put on my old camel-hair robe, and continued my scissors and paste life.

New clothes have no fate with me, and used clothes are so unaffordable. Let civility be swept to the ground for the time being! This is a record. New dream.

### The Day of Layoff

— Xinmai

I have a friend who teaches at ×× Middle School. Because the school is not preparing to continue operating next semester, the principal summoned and held a meeting of faculty and staff on a certain morning in mid-December. News had already spread in advance, and the faces of most faculty and staff showed displeasure because whether they could get their monthly salary was a question, and unemployment next semester had become a problem.

In addition to the meeting that day, the principal also prepared four tables of wine and food, and the dishes were quite rich. It is said that the price of each table was 200 yuan. However, when everyone arrived and the principal stood up to report, what made all the faculty and staff gasp was that the principal began by saying that because the tuition fees collected by the school had been completely used to repay debts, the salaries could not be paid in full. Only half a month's salary would be paid for December, and there was no way for January. This meant that each teacher received one and a half months less salary, which really made all the staff look at each other in dismay, not knowing whether to laugh or cry!

The principal continued, saying that otherwise, if we continued to operate next semester, there would certainly be ways to think about the economic aspects. Now that we are not preparing to continue, we can no longer borrow money from others. When the semester ends, there will be no remaining funds, and for expenses, we will have to borrow money temporarily from others. Everything else can be figured out, but there is no way to figure out money.

All the faculty and staff were silent. Although the dishes that day were good, they seemed to have no taste when eaten. My friend finally stood up and spoke: "We have nothing else to say, except that we feel that the 200 yuan per table feast today is unnecessary. It would be more practical to divide this 800 yuan feast fee among us. Whether it's 5 yuan or 10 yuan per person, it would certainly be good to get even a penny more for poor teachers on this day. I wonder what the principal thinks?" This question was indeed somewhat miserable, and the principal naturally could not find appropriate words to answer...

Since there was no way to get money, there was naturally nothing to say. After eating the food, all the teachers and staff took half a month's salary from the principal helplessly. Everyone dispersed, and deeply felt that this day of layoff was too miserable. Other people can get severance pay, but poor teachers even received one and a half months less salary than they should have!

### Talking About the "Change" Problem

— Si Hua

I have heard many people talk about the "change" on the trams, which has now disappeared invisibly. The people who talk about it don't necessarily mind losing a few cents, but they feel regretful afterward. In fact, this is a social problem that is commonly seen and should be reformed. I have repeatedly taken the eastbound tram from New World to Bowling Alley, the fare is 12 cents. In the past, I would give the ticket seller 15 cents, partly because it was crowded and partly because I was in a hurry to get off the bus. He didn't give me change, and I didn't have time to argue with him. Today, when I took the bus, I gave him 20 cents. In theory, 7 cents should not be returned, but 5 cents should at least be returned. Before getting off the bus, I gave him a look, and he actually said, "Sorry, no small change," and that was it. This made me feel that this bad habit is becoming more and more serious.

After the ticket sellers had the case of taking advantage of people's lives, this trend has not completely stopped, but it has been slightly clarified. Now, this disguised form of taking advantage of people, using the excuse of not having small change and not giving change, is in full swing. Although this bad habit is not shared by all ticket sellers, the fact is very obvious and common. Most of the passengers are unwilling to argue with the ticket seller for a few cents. Even if they do argue, the other party is actually eloquent, completely different from the style of taking advantage of people, which skillfully causes conflict and delays the trip, thus creating a situation of "invisibly canceling change." Even the ticket inspectors ignore people's questions, indicating that they are also powerless, so the passengers should suffer a little loss!

Taking advantage of people is an immoral behavior, and not giving change is also an immoral behavior. It is never possible to use the lack of small change as a reason to ask for sympathy. Tacitly allowing ticket sellers to take advantage of people is equivalent to helping ticket sellers grow into immoral behavior; tacitly allowing ticket sellers to waive the return of change is not a mutated helper. Passengers should prepare small change in advance as much as possible and buy tickets at the price. Otherwise, when they encounter not giving change, they should also ask for it. They should not leave until they really have no change. They cannot tacitly allow ticket sellers to waive the return. The tram company authorities should investigate and reform this kind of fact in the shortest possible time. It may not be a remedy to reissue vouchers at a price. I think this suggestion will definitely win the sympathy of passengers, and I hope it can be implemented quickly.

### Rent Disputes

— Youzhui

Rent disputes in Shanghai are inherently one of the major practical social problems. Many large landlords take whatever they want, and second landlords act as accomplices, and the common people, who are third tenants, have the pain of not having a place to stand. But what about now? There are people who are laying off population, and there are people who cannot pay such a large rent. What should we do? With a thunderclap, the Municipal Council issued a brilliant announcement: "...At this difficult time, landlords...must be as reasonable as possible when demanding rent that is due. If possible, landlords should allow tenants to extend the payment period or temporarily reduce the rent..." At the same time, the French Concession Consul General also had the same announcement. This is really well handled, which alleviates a lot of the burden on the people. To be honest, if the rent can be paid, and there is no conflict with the landlord or even the second landlord, there will be less trouble; however, what is a pity is that some landlords are now seeing red in the eyes, and are negotiating to get "tips" from old tenants, which are two or three times higher than the rent. Now, they might as well take a break.

### One Five. Dad, Let's Go Busking!

Things were about to get out of hand.

Meibao couldn't bear to blame her father again, so she had to bite the bullet and argue with them.

"Since you are superiors, you shouldn't have talked nonsense like that in the first place, and you were the first to hit someone!"

The waiters were at a loss as to how to persuade them.

At this moment, three more people walked in from outside the door; Little Li and the chubby boy didn't recognize them, but Meibao and the other four were familiar with them, and the main thing was that they were relieved, because these two were none other than the guests who had listened to them sing in No. 9 just now.

"Friends, please spare them! They are busking to make a living, which is quite pitiful," the oldest of the three said to Little Li and the chubby boy with a smile on his face.

At the same time, the student-like young man who had just paid ten yuan for listening to a play couldn't wait to urge Qiu Haitang and the other four to leave, saying repeatedly, "We'll take care of things here, you guys go back quickly!"

Meibao and the others also understood that he meant well, and hurriedly left the room according to him. (290)

The previous three issues of "Qiu Haitang" were numbered 287, 288, and 289, which is hereby corrected.

### Announcement of Essay Awards: Twelve Childhood Love

— Xinheng

Love is indeed not a children's game, which is further confirmed by my own unfortunate experience.

My family has prospered in recent years due to my father's willingness to take risks. The old man transformed from a pot-bellied clerk to a Western-style suit and leather shoes. I am his second daughter. My older sister was assigned by my father to a branch manager under him in her early years. A delicate younger sister at home is my aunt's (Southerners call my father's concubine "aunt"). My younger sister is trapped in the countryside with my mother, and my older brother has a pair of little girls who always clamor to go to school with my twin brother. My aunt "usually" doesn't love me, but fortunately, my birth coincided with the beginning of my father's fortune. My father is superstitious about this coincidence and calls me the pearl of the "lucky boy". In order to compete for favor, my aunt usually doesn't dare to discriminate too obviously.

We lived in peace for a few years, and I studied quietly. Until I was fifteen years old, I suddenly gradually felt a kind of thirst as if I needed something. In addition, I didn't get the love of my mother, so I couldn't help but be deeply flattered by the pursuit of a male classmate in school! I gradually fell into the sea of love from blushing. The school authorities, hindered by the fact that the Fairy family and my family were powerful school directors, did not interfere with us, and we played childish games without scruples, indulging ourselves uncontrollably. As a result, my father arranged our engagement.

I deeply recalled several times and asked myself if I really loved him at that time and fell in love with him? Tears soaked my handkerchief, and my nostrils twitched and turned red. I definitely admit that I did love him at that time, but I did only love a Western doll. No one will deny that although individuals have loved nipples in infancy and Western dolls in childhood, they can't love nipples and Western dolls when they grow up. The reason why I am indifferent to him now is really because of the evolution of the big performance, and certainly not because I have changed my mind.

It's not that I intend to mock him, nor is it that I deliberately devalue him as a Western doll. The reasons are:

(1) His family is very complicated. His father, who is also a nouveau riche, raised several mothers who do not live together single-handedly.

(2) Although he himself is loyal and honest, he is not studious, his thinking is immature, and he can only give me sweet love letters, but there is not a single encouraging word.

(3) At that time, the engagement was made because the parents of both sides were barely engaged because of the "established fact" that "they both liked each other." (It is said that when he asked his father to propose to my family, his father scolded him for being young and ignorant.)

(4) He is a adopted son of the moth called the stepmother, and he is very unpopular with his family. When he suffers losses, he often encourages me to use the negative method of "ending up without a result."

(5) Even if I really marry him, I think I will definitely not be used to it. The complicated family life is difficult for myself, not to mention that I may have to increase the friction between him and his family because of his love for me.

Next year, I plan to go to university. I don't want to disturb my brain preparing for lessons because of this unresolved case. I hope that the wise editor and experienced readers will give me a safe green light.

Editor's note: According to Miss Xinheng's description of the family, it is indeed not a source of happiness. However, the five problems she listed cannot be the reasons for dissolving the engagement, and they also show that she has not sown the seeds of good luck in her own marriage. First, she must recognize that what she is marrying is not his family but him. She should not be disappointed in him, but should instruct him and tell him how to improve himself if her intelligence is stronger than him. A girl once made small clothes for her Western doll and imagined making her Western doll satisfied. Why can't a grown woman enrich the mind of her Western doll and make him progress? Even if he has a white beard, she can love him as she protects a Western doll. Before you have exhausted your final efforts, never let the buds of hope be extinguished, and many successful people should record the reasons for their success in their wives' accounts. I hope Miss Xinheng will make extra efforts to cultivate a great man in the future.

### Do You Love Him?

If you are in love, or after you are married, you can ask the following questions to test whether you love him after all.

1. When you are together, do you feel the joy of being far away from each other?

2. Do you like to do the same work together? 3. Do you reconcile immediately after arguing with each other? Are these disputes unimportant?

3. Are you willing to make concessions to him? Can you forget or forgive his shortcomings?

4. Among the general men, is it possible for him to stand out from the crowd?

5. Do you get more excitement from him in terms of spirituality?

The answers to these questions can tell you whether you love him.

Miss Jinhua: Your letter has been forwarded to the scholarship section, please don't worry.

Mr. Delin: Pain like yours is very common. Many husbands feel that their wives are fond of vanity, spend money indiscriminately, and have no way to deal with it. Mr. Delin, you can explain your pain to your wife, but at the same time, you must strive for progress, because everyone lives on hope. If there is no hope for progress, you will lack the interest in life. A foundation in the first year of junior high school cannot be an obstacle to your progress. Many successful great men have never even been to school.

Mr. Yichengqiu: The stench and complexity of large families have been said too much to this day. Your father's thinking is the traditional thinking of the masters of general families, holding on to the family property and refusing to let go. However, you have not stated how old you are, what education you have received, and why you have no occupation. I think it is a shame for young people to rely on a little family property to maintain their lives without seeking self-reliance. Why don't you immediately find a way to seek self-reliance and linger on a little bit of family property?

### Monday Home Cooking Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Recently, in the small vegetable market, the price of fish is the cheapest for hairtail, and among the vegetables, celery is the cheapest. Celery is divided into two types: medicinal celery and water celery. Each bunch is priced at around one and a half to two corners. Medicinal celery has a medicinal smell, and some people don't like to eat it, but its taste is actually very clear and elegant. Water celery is also the same; stir-frying them with shredded pork or shredded beef is great with rice. If you want to make a vegetarian dish, you can stir-fry it with dried tofu shreds. For something simpler, you can mix it for eating. Just scald it in hot water first, then mix it with soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame paste, etc. After eating greasy food, a plate of mixed celery to go with porridge is definitely very appetizing.

Monday: Stir-fried Pork with Celery, Sweet and Sour Fried Hairtail, Spinach and Tofu Soup, Fried Dough Sticks, Yellow Soybeans, Mao

Tuesday: Vermicelli with Shredded Beef, Scrambled Duck Eggs, Braised Rolls, Vegetable Snow Cabbage and Broad Beans

— Draft by Yao Kechang

Ingredients: Grass carp, egg white, salt, cooking wine, MSG, chicken soup. Preparation: First, scrape off the scales of the grass carp, then remove the fish bones, wash it clean, and chop it into fish paste on a cutting board. Put it in a bowl, add an appropriate amount of water, egg white, MSG, cooking wine, salt, etc. Use dozens of chopsticks to vigorously stir it until it becomes mushy. Then you can make the balls. When making them, place a large bowl of warm water next to you (the temperature should not be too hot). Then, use your right hand to grab a handful of fish mixture from the bowl. Cooperate with your index finger and thumb to make a circle. Squeeze the fish mixture in your hand out from the circle to form a fish ball. Immediately put it into the warm water. Wait for it to float, then you can scoop it up. When eating, cook it with chicken soup or vermicelli, and the taste will be very good.

### (153) Roast Beef

— Draft by Gao Peiqing

Ingredients: Beef or mutton, salt, dry flour. Preparation: First, rub salt around the entire piece of beef, marinate for one or two hours. Then, use a fork to hold the meat and hang it flat in front of the stove. When starting to roast, keep it a little further away from the fire, then move it closer to the fire. First roast the side with the bones. When it is half cooked, turn it over to roast. Repeat roasting for about half an hour until the meat is fully cooked. When roasting the meat, you must use another container to place under the meat to store the dripping juice, and frequently pour it on the meat. When roasting, you must also apply dry flour around the meat to prevent it from burning.
