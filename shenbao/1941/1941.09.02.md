### US Approves Foreign-Registered Ships to Transport Oil to the Philippines: Demonstrates Economic Pressure on Japan, Pacific Problem Not to Be Solved Unilaterally

Hyde Park, 1st - United Press: President Roosevelt yesterday established a new route for supplying oil to the U.S. Far East forces in the Philippines, thereby strengthening the U.S. presence in the Far East. Under the power of unlimited emergency, the President lifted the 37-year-old ban on foreign-registered ships transporting gasoline, fuel oil, and lubricating oil to the Philippines. As in previous "economic warfare" actions against Japan, the President permitted the oil transport without criticism. However, it is apparent that the move is intended to gradually exert economic pressure on Japan. It was not stated which nationality of ships would transport lubricating oil to the U.S. forces in the Philippines. However, the order will allow British and Dutch oil tankers to transport oil from the Dutch East Indies, establishing vital gasoline supply routes from Southeast Asia to the U.S. Army in the Far East. The establishment of this supply route from the Dutch East Indies to the Philippines will alleviate some of the difficulties in the U.S. mainland caused by a shortage of oil tankers and the gasoline panic on the East Coast due to U.S. oil tankers being leased to Britain. Therefore, the U.S., at least for the time being, cannot use sufficient tonnage of U.S. oil tankers for travel between the U.S. and the Philippines Army. The commander of the Philippines Army has been authorized to sign contracts and modify existing contracts to allow a rapid and continuous flow of Dutch East Indies lubricating oil into the Philippines.

Washington, 1st - International News Service: The State Department today declared that the U.S. government will not engage in separate commercial solutions with Japan regarding the Pacific problem, as Japan's occupation of China and Vietnam involves too much. The fundamental policy of the United States is that to resolve the Pacific problem, it must invite Britain, the Dutch East Indies, and other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to negotiate jointly. However, the U.S. may take free steps to discuss methods of adjustment for problems that are purely between Japan and the U.S. It is believed that the current informal talks between Japan and the U.S. may develop into a general solution for Japan-U.S. relations, but under the current circumstances, success is feared to be unlikely.

Los Angeles, 1st - International News Service: California Governor Olson today predicted at a meeting of American-born Japanese youth that the habit of "saving face" will force Japan to fight with the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union.

Tokyo, 1st - United Press: Renowned moderate political commentator Kiyosawa Kiyoshi declared in the Chugai Shogyo Shimpo yesterday that Japan is at the final crossroads of war and peace, and pointedly asked General Toyoda to "do more bargaining in his diplomatic dealings." The statement was published in the newspaper's "Open Letter to General Toyoda." Kiyosawa Kiyoshi praised his silence since taking office as Foreign Minister and asked him not to pay attention to the so-called public opinion in the newspapers.

Tokyo, 1st - United Press: The "Yomiuri Shimbun" said today that Britain and other third powers are now vigorously plotting to drag Japan into war against the U.S. in order to profit from the situation. The U.S. warned Japan in the upcoming U.S.-Japan diplomatic negotiations, "Do not act rashly based on a lack of correct understanding."

### U.S. Fully Prepared to Deal with Japan's Southern Advance

New York Airmail, special correspondent Thomson: Japan has been planning a southern advance for nearly ten years. Although the plan is not as explosive as that of the Nazis, it has deeply penetrated the two major destinations of Singapore and the East Indies with its power. If war truly breaks out between the U.S. and Japan, the U.S. fleet will inevitably intercept Japan from the south. In naval tactics, there is no precedent for the U.S. fleet crossing the Pacific from Hawaii to directly attack Japan. To attack Japan, it must advance gradually from the south, while maintaining vast lines of communication and constantly establishing bases. Japan believes that war with the U.S. is very possible. Japanese naval leaders believe that if the U.S. fleet wants to attack Japan, it must first embark on a long journey, and Japan has this geographical advantage, making it easy to fight the U.S. decisively. The Japanese Navy also believes that Japan's possession of Cam Ranh Bay, Saigon, the Spratly Islands, and Hainan Island is sufficient to withstand the impact of the southern advance. Even if the British and American fleets join forces to contain Japan, Japan will not be afraid. Thus, Japan is consolidating its defensive strategy with its so-called "southern advance policy." Currently, Japan does not seem to have any immediate conspiracy against the East Indies and Singapore. Any southern advance by Japan from Vietnam is tantamount to a desperate gamble. If Japan is willing to do so, the serious consequences will not be a matter of Japanese honor but of survival. President Roosevelt said, "If we had cut off Japan's oil supply earlier, Japan would have already advanced south, and you would have already been at war." This statement best represents the psychology of U.S. policy. Today's United States is far more prepared to deal with Japanese aggression than it was a year ago. To further understand Japan's current actions, it can be seen in Mr. Arita's remarks. Arita was ordered to conduct trade negotiations with the Dutch East Indies, but he was repeatedly unsuccessful. I spoke with Mr. Arita after the U.S. terminated the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty in 1939 (which had not yet taken effect at that time). At that time, Tokyo was chanting the establishment of a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. I inquired of Mr. Arita, and Mr. Arita told reporters, "I confirm that the Japanese government is not currently considering such an event. Some people here believe that Japan is being pressured too much by the great powers, including the United States, and will therefore take a tough stance, or some elements of a political agreement with the Soviet Union advocate such extreme measures. However, I believe that we have not yet reached such a state of despair." In terms of Mr. Arita's definition of a state of despair, Japan now seems to have reached this state. Japan has not only signed a neutrality treaty with the Soviet Union, but has also joined the ranks of the Axis powers. This dual display shows that Japanese leaders feel that Japan is "being pressured too much by the great powers, including the United States," and therefore Japan is taking "extreme measures." The treaty with the Soviet Union was originally intended to remove the threat to Japan's back door. The war between Germany and the Soviet Union has created a complex situation. Therefore, Japan is now increasingly uneasy about its back door.

Tokyo, 1st - Reuters: Colonel Mabuchi Itsuo, Chief of Intelligence of the Army General Staff, today addressed the crowd gathered here for East Asia Memorial Day, saying that recent unfriendly actions by Britain and the United States, whether we like it or not, have placed Japan at the crossroads of the empire's rise and fall. The above and other military remarks contrast sharply with the cautious attitude of government officials awaiting the result of Konoe's letter to the U.S. President. Mabuchi also urged taking countermeasures to break through the joint encirclement of Japan by Britain and the United States.

### Soviet Diplomatic Personnel Suddenly Fly to Washington, Two Seaplanes Pass Over Alaska

Nome, Alaska, 1st - United Press: Two Soviet seaplanes carrying forty-seven Soviet passengers with diplomatic passports departed from Moscow and refueled here this morning before continuing to Washington. Their mission has not been announced. The two planes landed here suddenly last night without prior notice.

Although their trip to Washington is not being concealed, there is no indication of what requests they are making to the U.S. government.

### Burmese Prime Minister to Visit Britain

London, 1st - Reuters: Burmese Prime Minister Saw will soon travel to Britain to personally deliver to the British government and people a message of goodwill from the Burmese government and people. He will be accompanied by his advisor, Ding Tu, a senior Burmese civil servant. Saw joined the cabinet in 1939 and became Prime Minister the following year. After taking office, he published an article explaining his cabinet's policies, saying that he would strive for the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people and asking all Burmese people to unite in common responsibility. Burma's position and status in the Far East are becoming increasingly important. Its proximity to China makes it a conduit for overseas supplies into China.

### 20,000 Philippine Soldiers Join US Army

Manila, 1st - Reuters: Twenty thousand Philippine reserve officers and soldiers joined the U.S. Army this morning in various parts of the Philippines. U.S. military officers, representing the U.S. government, accepted them. The ceremony included supervised oaths and accompaniment by the U.S. and Philippine national anthems. The largest number of people were at Fort McKinley. Major General Wainwright addressed the joining Philippine troops, saying that in the event of war, our two countries will stand shoulder to shoulder and fulfill our respective responsibilities.

### Archbishop of Westminster Speaks, Distinguishing War Aims

London, 1st - Reuters: The Archbishop of Westminster, Hinsley, spoke in Aldershot yesterday in English and French to the Canadian troops in Britain. He said that some people point out that any war is contrary to justice and completely opposed to Christian teachings, and argue that the Church forbids people to participate in any war. In fact, this is a dangerously false conclusion. War is indeed cruel and hateful, and the calamities suffered by mankind are the greatest because of it. But as long as unrestrained lust, jealousy, greed, and the tyrannical system of ambition exist, mankind cannot escape the scourge of war. Some people take war as the greatest goal in life and use peace to prepare for future wars. They consider themselves to be the rulers of nations and others to be the ruled. Regardless of good or evil, right or wrong, they base everything on the interests of their own country or party. They inflict harm on good people in the name of this heretical principle, invading, massacring, expelling, destroying homes, and enslaving people. This kind of crime is no different from war and plunder. Rising up to protect these oppressed and massacred people to fight against this nation is not only justified but also necessary. Fighting for war is truly evil, but fighting for peace is just. Soldiers who die on the battlefield for their compatriots, for their families, and for their country reach the highest level of charity. There is a difference between true and false peace. Those who shout for peace when there is no peace only want to rest for a while in order to take the opportunity to carry out their continued conquest plans. All healthy men should fight hard to achieve Christ's peace, and so on.

### Hitler's Attack on the Soviet Union a Big Mistake, British People Determined to Fight Hard to Relieve Future Panic

London, 1st - Reuters: British Minister Attlee answered yesterday why Germany did not invade Britain, saying that Hitler knew that the British Air Force was stronger than he had imagined. Hitler made a big mistake by attacking the Soviet Union, as he did not expect the Soviet Union to resist so strongly. The British people are now engaged in a struggle in which everyone must exert their full strength. A slight relaxation, even if only temporary, could change the future of the war. We want to relieve the general public of future panic over the displacement of their families, the separation of their loved ones, and the inability to make a living.

Colonel Nagato, leader of the naval mission to Vietnam, has been transferred to the Naval General Staff as chief of section. The vacancy will be filled by Colonel Horiuchi.

### Second Anniversary of the European War: Review of British Military Strength: Army Has Increased to Three Million Men, Assembled in London and the Near East

London, 1st - Reuters: Reuters military commentator General Goff reviewed the development of British military strength over the past two years on the second anniversary of the European War, saying that when Britain rose up to resist Germany's attempt to carve up Poland two years ago, its military position was extremely weak. Since then, its strength has greatly increased, but its power still needs to reach its peak. When Hitler's unprovoked invasion of Poland led to the outbreak of war, the British Army's size was small, its equipment was lacking, and it was unable to fight. The training of the Territorial Army was also inadequate, and the scope of the garrisons stationed at key transportation hubs around the world was very small. Although a corps was sent to France to assist in the war, its equipment and supplies were already strained. Unfortunately, in May and June of last year, a storm of events temporarily caused France to fall, and the British Air Force was also swept away by this surge. Thanks to the efforts of the Navy and Air Force, most of the soldiers in France escaped danger, but their equipment was lost. The Norwegian and Greek campaigns further depleted British strength. Britain was able to turn danger into safety in this critical moment thanks to the efforts of its Air Force and the courage of the British people under the leadership of Prime Minister Churchill to cope with hardships and the enthusiasm of those who volunteered to serve in the Home Guard. Today, British military strength is gradually being replenished, which is incomparable to the past. The Army has now increased to at least three million men, with good organization and capable commanders. The previous losses have long been replenished, and there are many anti-aircraft guns, flat-trajectory guns, and field guns to protect domestic factories, and military and air force bases are densely distributed everywhere, stretching from Iceland to both the east and west coasts of Africa, then along the southern coast of Asia and far to Singapore and Hong Kong in the Pacific. Although the Army has not yet reached the stage of launching a large-scale offensive to sweep away the enemy and achieve complete victory, it has assembled in both London and the Near East, allocating strength according to a sound strategy, and the need to curb Japanese aggression now requires Britain to assemble its Third Army in the Pacific, ready to deploy at any time. Although the number of British troops has not yet reached that of the enemy, it has achieved some glorious victories, no less than the armies of other countries, such as the campaigns in Libya, Abyssinia, and Syria, where British troops were able to defeat enemies with larger numbers and equal equipment. Today, the British Army around the world is gradually reaching a high standard of mechanization.

Editorial

### The Industrial Cooperative System and Economic Construction

The industrial cooperative movement began in August 1938, initially promoted by the China Industrial Cooperative Association established in Hankou, with active promotion from both the government and the public. Friendly foreign personnel worked hard to provide guidance, thus allowing the establishment and expansion of societies in various border areas. It proceeded rapidly, appearing to form a system. According to the association's report in January of this year, there were already two thousand established units, with thirty thousand members, spread across sixteen provinces, with monthly production totaling one million two hundred thousand yuan, government loans of ten million yuan, and national bank loans of twenty million yuan, as well as huge donations from Chinese and foreign individuals. The general situation of the development of this special enterprise system over the past two years should not be taken lightly.

In terms of significance, the industrial cooperative system mobilizes the nation's human, material, and financial resources to promote production activities and quality at all stages and in all regions, assembling them into a complete production mechanism and output necessary for the entire nation, hoping to obtain the highest production efficiency at the lowest possible cost. At first glance, the emergence of this system seems to be solely due to the urgent needs of the national policy of resistance. Upon closer examination, it is actually laying the foundation for the nation's economy, and is likely to coexist and prosper with our nation, forever immortal. The great importance of this relationship should be kept in mind and observed at all times, serving as a spur for encouragement and implementation. Now, let us extend its meaning.

Since the reform of the political system in the early Republic, all the people rejoiced. However, due to years of natural disasters and man-made calamities, the government had no time to consider the construction of the economy and society, except for what was seen in proposals and a very small number of implementations, leading to a situation of distorted development. At that time, the government devoted almost all its efforts to the rapid construction of treaty port cities and towns, with occasional layout of inland transportation lines and embellishment of water conservancy projects. As for what was necessary for the people's livelihood, there was a need to rely on imports, which shows that the shortcomings of our country's production construction were numerous.

In short, our past mistake lies in our failure to plan comprehensively and to build in an orderly manner. If we had already filled the border areas with production units, then the economic strength of our country today would certainly be considerable, and the coastal areas could also avoid major sacrifices. Considering that in recent years Soviet Russia has opened up production areas in the Ural Mountains and the remote areas of Siberia, it shows the meticulousness of its plans and the far-sightedness of its intentions. Hitler's establishment of production facilities in the valleys also aims to cope with enemy blockades and attacks.

Considering the vastness of our country, the fragility of our economic structure, and the increasingly narrow international environment, and wanting to take our country's national economy and people's livelihood as the premise, to build a complete and strong national economic structure, how can things be simple and accomplished overnight! Learning from the past and planning for the future, judging the situation and measuring the labor, only the industrial cooperative system promoted today is most suitable for the national conditions. Moreover, it must still take today's widespread areas as its source, and gradually extend it to the hinterland and coastal areas as the most reasonable step.

In recent years, our country's construction has taken the concentration of capital to establish large-scale enterprises as a means, and the control of the market as the goal. Moreover, the so-called large-scale enterprises, except for state-owned public utilities, are mostly sales organizations, not direct production organizations. This type of construction method is neither a fundamental plan nor does it adapt to the international environment. In the future, our country's industry and commerce will inevitably be constrained by the international situation, and will have to rely heavily on international supply; if we want to build large-scale centralized enterprises to compete with Europe and the United States, the strength is very different. What is the difference between making a cocoon and binding oneself? Therefore, large-scale centralized enterprises are not the urgent task, and large-scale decentralized enterprises will become the lifeline of our nation. It is essential that everyone participates in this production work, adapting to the minimum living needs of the entire nation as the standard, and making full use of the three factors of favorable weather, advantageous terrain, and harmonious human relations. Now, the only thing that can meet the aforementioned conditions is the industrial cooperative movement. The start of this industrial cooperative movement today should not be regarded as a measure taken at the last minute; on the contrary, we should do our best to support it, nurture it, and promote it, and make it the foundation for national rejuvenation. I hope that the people of the country will rise up and catch up, and work together to promote progress, so that the loss in the east can be compensated in the west.

Stabilizing the sentiment in Shanghai, allowing the sale of foreign exchange to the Central Bank; 2. Negotiating with Britain and the United States to grant our Central Bank the privilege of unfreezing, and facilitating China's foreign trade, also established a Foreign Exchange Control Committee to strengthen foreign exchange control. (5) Finance: In accordance with the resolution of the Eighth Plenary Session, efforts are being made to reform the fiscal system, which not only unifies national finance but also greatly helps local construction. The facilities for the collection of land tax in kind and the purchase of surplus grain are also progressing smoothly in practice. (Reported on the 1st)

### Japanese Planes Again Attack Chongqing; Yi Shi Bao Completely Destroyed; Orphans' Home for Fallen Soldiers Hit by Bombs

It continued to publish from the rubble, without missing a single day. This year it has been repeatedly bombed in the surrounding area. Editor Xie Yunpeng even sacrificed his life in the line of duty. Although the remaining staff worked in a dilapidated building with leaking roofs, they persevered and continued to publish as usual. Although this loss is extremely severe, it is reported that they are determined to continue publishing. However, due to printing difficulties, they will temporarily publish a half-sheet. Once things are organized, they will resume publishing a full sheet as soon as possible. According to the newspaper's chairman of the board speaking to reporters, Yi Shi Bao has a long history of 26 years since its founding. From the day it was born, it felt that militarist nations were a major threat to the survival of all countries. Therefore, for more than 20 years, it has continuously struggled. Yi Shi Bao will never show the slightest timidity because of this, nor can it stop its sacred mission because of the destruction of material things. It will still publish as usual tomorrow, fulfilling the duty of a journalist. (Dispatch, 31st)

### German and Italian Troops Concentrated on Turkish Border; Tensions Increase in Eastern Europe; Turkish President and Chief of Staff Declare

Prepared to Fight for Peace and Security Reuters dispatch, London, 1st: The situation in Eastern Europe is becoming increasingly tense. Observers feel that there are two new phenomena in the situation: one is Germany's preparation to send troops to the Black Sea, and the other is Turkey's possibility of resisting and implementing a blackout. Turkish cities, only a few miles away from Europe, which is implementing blackouts, were lit up with lights and flags last night to celebrate the 19th anniversary of the victory in the Turkish-Greek war. Suddenly, news came from Moscow that Hitler intended to attack Turkey and had stationed four divisions on the Turkish border. There were also reports from Istanbul that German officers are currently studying Turkish terrain and teaching their soldiers how to break through natural obstacles. Rumors say that German troops are now advancing towards the border. According to Istanbul estimates, Germany intends to increase the German troops stationed on the Turkish border to 300,000 in a short period of time. However, Turkey's preparedness can also be seen in the speeches of the Turkish President and Chief of Staff on the anniversary of the victory. The Turkish President said, "If the Turkish government's clear and sincere efforts prove ineffective, and the Turkish army is ordered to fulfill its duty, then I believe the army will definitely increase the glory in the heroic behavior of young people." The Chief of Staff also said, "The Turkish army is equipped with the latest weapons and is prepared to implement the government's orders for peace and security to the last drop of blood. Our army has the necessary ability to fulfill its duty." According to Ankara sources, the Turkish government has made great efforts in the past week to maintain peace. The Turkish President personally met with the British and German ambassadors, and the British and German ambassadors also visited the Turkish Foreign Minister. Now the German ambassador has been summoned back to his country, probably as a prelude to his dismissal, because Hitler is displeased with his failure to induce Turkey to join the German side.

Associated Press dispatch, Moscow, 1st: Yesterday's newspapers prominently published a message from Geneva, claiming that a large number of Italian troops were concentrated on the borders of Greece, Turkey, and Bulgaria-Turkey.

Havas dispatch, Berne, Switzerland, 30th: The "Basler Nachrichten" recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in the Turkish capital, stating that Britain, the United States, and the Axis powers are engaged in a decisive struggle in Turkey, the outcome of which will be sufficient to determine Turkey's fate. Since Britain and the Soviet Union sent troops to Iran, Britain and the United States have gained an advantage. British Ambassador to Turkey Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's activities in the Turkish capital are supported by the American ambassador. The American ambassador has informed the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs that his government fully agrees with the actions of Britain and the Soviet Union in Iran. Judging from the activities of the diplomatic community in the Turkish capital, the Soviet Union's previous war, and the sending of British and Soviet troops to Iran, it can be seen that the tension in Turkey and the Near East is increasing day by day. According to unconfirmed reports, German Ambassador to Turkey Franz von Papen returned to his country to report on his duties and visited Hitler at the headquarters of Ukrainian leader Bandera to discuss a plan to counteract what Britain and the Soviet Union have done in Iran. Germany's military strength stationed in Bulgaria is to increase pressure on Turkey. In recent days, Turkish and Bulgarian radio stations have attacked each other, and the Turkish authorities have confirmed that this has made relations between the two countries tense. However, Germany and Bulgaria may not be able to use force against Turkey. In Turkey, they firmly advocate peace and hope that the war in Iran can be stopped immediately, because the Soviet Union's attack on Iran is not only enough to strengthen the Soviet Union's power in the Near East, but also makes the Soviet-Turkish border longer. In addition, the Soviet Union's occupation of the Iranian oil fields is also deeply feared to be not temporary, or even to cause a reaction from the German side. All of this is not what Turkey wants to hear.

### Iranian Representatives Negotiating Armistice With British and Soviet Representatives; Soviet Troops Continue To Advance Into Iran; Iranian Prime Minister Tells People Not To Believe Rumors

Haitong Agency dispatch, Iranian capital, 1st: The armistice terms of Britain and the Soviet Union were received here the night before yesterday. The Iranian newspapers in yesterday morning's official gazette stated that the Iranian government is currently negotiating with representatives of Britain and the Soviet Union, and detailed information will be announced soon. The newspaper solemnly pointed out that the war has now stopped, and the people can quell panic. It is reported that the Soviet troops have advanced to Kasvin, 160 kilometers northwest of Tehran. Yesterday morning, Soviet planes dropped leaflets here.

Reuters dispatch, Mohammarah, 1st: According to a recently published communiqué, the British and Soviet troops in Iran have made initial contact. Britain is now prohibited from taking offensive actions on land and in the air, so the damage to the railway tracks between Bandar Shahpur and Gaiger is clearly the work of the Iranian army. The Kaman area is now very peaceful. General Quinan, commander of the British forces in Iran, has replied to General Wavell, commander-in-chief of the British forces in India, thanking him for his congratulatory message.

Reuters dispatch, Moscow, 1st: The Soviet troops entering northwestern Iran have now advanced 160 kilometers to Zanjan (halfway between Tabriz and Tehran, on the main highway to Tehran) and Rasht (20 miles southeast of Pahlavi, on the Caspian Sea. Pahlavi is the starting point of the highway to Tehran). News from Tabriz said that, according to interviews with villagers in northern Iran, German special agents are quite active in these areas, especially after the opening of the Eastern Front. These special agents have told villagers that German troops have occupied many places in the Caucasus and are trying to incite the anti-Soviet sentiment of the villagers. Port officials in Pahlavi also told the Soviet troops that German special agents have laid a network of spies, using the names of commercial firms to transport many weapons and explosives, and openly inquired about confidential reports, and are very concerned about the strength of the Soviet Caspian Sea Fleet.

Tass dispatch, Meshed, 1st: Red Army cavalry have entered Iran for 160 kilometers and arrived in Meshed. The public had learned about it in advance from Soviet airplane leaflets, and gathered in the streets to welcome them. The Iranian Ninth Infantry Division did not resist. Iranian soldier Aishan La said, "The Germans tried to force our country to fight against our friendly neighbors. The Red Army's entry into Iran has saved us from unnecessary bloodshed. We welcome them very much."

Reuters dispatch, London, 1st: According to Tehran Radio, Iranian Prime Minister Foroughi said during a meeting of the Iranian Parliament yesterday that "Our discussions and actions have reached a clearer stage, and a satisfactory conclusion can be reached soon. Please do not believe various false rumors at present." He guaranteed that Tehran and the government were in no danger, and that there was sufficient food in the country. "But if someone who should buy one pound of food buys ten pounds, the new government will of course feel difficult."

Havas, Tehran, 31st: According to semi-official sources, Amoli, the military governor of the capital, has been responsible for implementing martial law and has taken various steps to dredge the sources of public food.

### British Bomb Tripoli; 25 Tons of Bombs Dropped; One 8,000-Ton Ship Destroyed; Sicilian Airfield Also Straffed

Reuters dispatch, Cairo, 1st: A communiqué stated that the British Air Force heavily bombed Tripoli in Cyrenaica at the weekend, dropping as many as 25 tons of bombs, causing a widespread fire along the coast of the port, with black smoke billowing high into the sky, apparently from oil depots on fire. Two enemy ships (8,000 tons and 5,000 tons) and another medium-sized enemy ship were also hit and burned. One of them exploded. Three fires broke out on the Karamanli embankment, affecting the gasoline depots and causing a thunderous explosion. The flames soared into the sky, and fires broke out everywhere along the wharf and loading dock. British planes flew to reconnaissance and saw an enemy ship of 8,000 tons outside the port completely destroyed by fire. The remaining two ships in the port were also severely burned. The Karamanli embankment is still burning. A fleet of enemy ships in front of the Giuliani embankment in the port of Benghazi was attacked by British planes flying at low altitude and hit, causing white smoke to erupt. Axis aircraft concentrated at the Barca airfield were also strafed by British aircraft. British naval aviation bombed the enemy's storage depot north of Pavia, causing a fire. On August 29th, the naval aviation attacked the Gibini airfield (Sicily), bombing and strafing it. A merchant ship (8,000 tons) escorted by an enemy destroyer was found off the coast of Sicily, and an attack was launched. The ship is believed to have been hit by a torpedo. At the weekend, British Air Force Blenheim planes bombed the power and munitions factories in the Ligata area, hitting the target and causing heavy damage. Within Abyssinia, the British Air Force and the South African Air Force bombed and strafed the enemy's positions in Taiberlai on August 29th and 30th, hitting targets such as fortresses and trenches. Of the British planes that participated in the above battles, only one did not return.

Reuters dispatch, Tobruk, 1st: A communiqué issued here stated that yesterday, a patrol of the British army in the Tobruk area engaged in a hand-to-hand attack on an enemy sentry post, causing heavy damage. The enemy's artillery attack was very fierce, but the British side suffered no damage. The two armies on the border opened fire and bombed each other.

Repeated Bombing of French and German Territories

Reuters dispatch, London, 1st: British fighter planes were dispatched very frequently yesterday. According to the information office of the Ministry of Aviation, as soon as dawn broke yesterday, British Spitfire fighters flew to the skies of France, and this offensive flight did not stop until dusk. Few enemy fighters were seen, and most of them fled as soon as they caught sight of the British aircraft. Therefore, there were not many engagements. A Canadian pilot engaged several Messerschmitt enemy fighters and shot down and damaged one enemy plane each. In the morning, British bombers, escorted by fighter planes, bombed important airfields and other targets in the Brest region of France twice. In the evening, a large number of British fighter planes flew to France to conduct activities. The German territory of Leimen was also bombed by a British Flying Fortress yesterday, hitting the center of the port. There was no anti-aircraft fire or resistance from enemy fighters.

Reuters dispatch, London, 1st: German radio said that dozens of British bombers flew over western and southwestern Germany last night, and enemy planes flying from the Baltic Sea attempted to fly to Berlin, but were driven away before reaching their destination.

Many Casualties in Hull, England

Reuters dispatch, Hull, 1st

This seaport on the northeast coast of England was bombed again by enemy planes last night, dropping multiple high-explosive bombs. The anti-aircraft teams opened fire and fired for an hour or so. Several houses and air-raid shelters were directly hit, so there were quite a few casualties. A woman and her three children were all killed by the bombing. Weeping on the side of the road, the situation was extremely tragic.

Associated Press dispatch, Folkestone, 1st: Chasing planes and bombers were very active in the skies over the English Channel yesterday, because the British air force launched a major attack on the European continent and northern France during the day yesterday. At least three times, attacks were launched over the English Channel during breakfast. One could only see Spitfires and Hurricanes soaring everywhere, back and forth. Listening to the loud sounds from the French occupied area, one knew that the bombing there must be very fierce. The first team of British planes was heard flying over during breakfast. Residents of the southern coast returning from church could see the second team of fighters and bombers flying over. Everyone expected that the third team must be departing in the afternoon, and believed that part of them were flying to the French coast, and another part were attacking Belgium.

Reuters dispatch, Cairo, 1st: An internal communiqué announced that enemy planes dropped bombs in Alexandria and the Suez Canal area last night. Two people were killed and 43 injured in Alexandria. There were no casualties in the Canal Zone. There was slight property loss in both places.

### Italy Detains Swiss Soldiers

Associated Press dispatch, Milan, 1st: Yesterday's news said that the Italian guards stationed on the border of Lake Maggiore detained four Swiss soldiers on Friday night. The four Swiss soldiers came from their country by boat and accidentally landed in Italy. After interrogation, they were sent back to the border and released.

### Axis Leaders; Swiss Soldiers

Tass dispatch, Geneva, 1st: It is learned here that the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini was to discuss the difficulties caused by the following facts: (1) Germany's failure of the blitzkrieg strategy against the Soviet Union; (2) the formation of a strong alliance between the Soviet Union and Britain with the support of the United States; (3) Germany's failed conspiracy in Iran; (4) the increasing economic and political difficulties of the Axis powers themselves.

### British Planes Heavily Attack French Industrial Zone

Associated Press dispatch, London, 1st: The British Ministry of Aviation stated that the British Air Force yesterday used its full strength to bomb French railway transportation, industrial targets in the Lille area, the Laning airfield, and the shipyard at Le Havre near Rouen, for almost an entire day. One newly arrived American-made "Flying Fortress" made a reconnaissance flight and bombed the port of Brest without encountering resistance. During yesterday's air raid, two British planes were lost.

### Kangchang Touring Group Returns to Chongqing from Chengdu

The Chongqing Political Council's Kangchang Touring Group arrived in Chongqing today from Chengdu. The group, consisting of more than 30 people, departed from Chongqing on July 8th. They traveled to Xichang in the Kang province via the Chengdu-Chongqing and the eastern and western Sichuan highways. The purpose of the trip was to investigate the living conditions of the people along the eastern and western highways and to promote economic development in the region. Wang [name missing], the head of the group, told reporters about his impressions of the trip, saying that the Kang region has fertile plains and a mild climate, with abundant agricultural products and rich underground resources. The abundant copper, iron, and other metal ores, as well as coal production, especially in the Ningyuan area, make it suitable as an industrial center for the Great Southwest. (31st dispatch)

European War Chatter (6) (7)

### Portraits of Three Key Figures in the British Cabinet

In 1931, MacDonald betrayed the Labour Party, and power reverted to the Conservative Party. Morrison, having proven his organizational genius, was offered a senior position by the government with an annual salary of £5,000. He declined, preferring to remain as secretary of the London Labour Party with an annual salary of only £500, plus £600 as a member of Parliament.

In 1934, the opportunity to realize his dream from twenty years ago arrived. In that year, the Labour Party gained control of the London city government. With the support of the Labour Party members in the City Council, he began his cleanup work. Rebuilding Waterloo Bridge was only the first step. Four hundred years ago, Shakespeare had already heard of "a green belt surrounding London." But time passed, and it was not until Morrison announced his green belt plan and began buying land outside London to create many parks and squares.

He opposed favoritism and had extraordinary determination. No one could seek to do favors for others, and no one could recommend relatives or friends. The London city government had 76,000 employees, and people often asked city councilors, "Can you get me a position?" His answer was always, "No, you can apply like everyone else, but you can't rely on influence to get a job."

All employees were warned that if anyone accepted bribes, they would be immediately dismissed. The London city government's annual expenditure was no less than £36 million, exceeding the budget of Switzerland. Most of this expenditure was used to purchase goods, including 43,000 doors, 10 million eggs, and 19 million envelopes, which was quite strange. All contracts were subject to strict bidding procedures.

No one knew that Morrison's work in the London Council in 1934 would become an important factor in World War II six years later. At that time, Londoners were quite satisfied with the effects of the new policies. Many houses that had been obstructing traffic were demolished. The streets were all widened, so that ambulances and fire trucks could speed through to reach disaster areas. Ambulance and fire services were improved, laying the foundation for today. The 72 municipal hospitals, which accounted for three-quarters of all hospital beds in London, were reformed, and the equipment was new. Patients, doctors, and nurses were very happy at the time, and the people of London today are undoubtedly grateful. Many workers' residences that had been considered uninhabitable were demolished and transformed into clean apartments, which were rented at low prices. Workers' residences were also built in the suburbs of London, with trees planted along the roads. Tenants were moved from the most crowded areas of London, which are also the areas that are most heavily bombed today. The London school budget required £12 million per year, and the schools were improved and expanded, with many new schools added, which are now used to accommodate the homeless. Various social undertakings, such as ditches, drainage, mental hospitals, orphanages, institutions for the blind, and public relief, were all reorganized. However, at the end of the Labour Party's three-year term, the improvements they hoped to achieve were actually few.

After the outbreak of the European War, Morrison became Minister of Home Security and was responsible for preventing foreign nationals and for national air defense. His only female official was Wilkinson. Within three weeks of taking office, Morrison adopted a ticketing system to prevent people from waiting in air-raid shelters. He also ordered 1.5 million bed frames for use in air-raid shelters, opened the basements of private buildings for public use, provided first-aid equipment in various rest areas, large air-raid shelters, and underground stations, quickly cared for the homeless, and found ways to keep the air-raid shelters warm on winter nights, and announced that daylight saving time would continue during the winter. He knew that his work was broader than his desk. When Coventry was suddenly bombed, he immediately rushed from London and personally directed the rescue under a rain of bombs.

He not only knew the urgency of existing work, but also abolished all red tape, so he was deeply trusted by the labor community. He did not have a strong union as a backing, but because he was trusted, he was still a Labour Party leader. Although he was a partisan figure, he was able to stand alone. Although he enforced the law strictly, he had a compassionate heart. When he spoke of the 1.5 million unemployed workers, he not only cited this number, but also remembered the tragic situation of the families of the 1.5 million unemployed workers. He was also not a sentimentalist. Social injustice aroused his cold anger and a desire to provide immediate relief. As long as one person was insecure, poorly clothed, unfed, or uneducated, he could not be satisfied.

The late Lord Lothian commented on Morrison: "He has a calm mind in times of crisis. He knows his mind. His political achievements are clean, intelligent, and effective. He will not let us down." (The End)

### Soviets Launch Fierce Attacks on All Fronts; German Offensive Halted; Soviet Air Force Unleashes Power Over Dnieper River, Bombing Pontoon Bridge, Inflicting 3,000 Casualties on Germans

United Press, Moscow, 1st – Fierce Soviet attacks reportedly checked the German offensive on all fronts yesterday. Soviet officials boast that Red Army resistance has turned Hitler's conquest plan into a "shameful failure." Reports indicate the Red Army inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans in intense fighting from the Arctic to the Black Sea. Allegedly, Nazi casualties in three major battles amounted to tens of thousands. As the Soviet campaign enters its eleventh week, "Izvestia" predicts the "complete collapse" of Hitler's original plan when he invaded Poland two years ago today. "Izvestia" claims the biggest blow to Hitler was the shattering of his hopes to isolate America through propaganda and sabotage. Supreme Command communiqués and front-line reports indicate fierce fighting across all fronts, with the Germans failing to make any gains at any point in the past three days.

TASS, Moscow, 1st – German attempt to cross the Dnieper River fails. Soviet air power unleashes its might in heavy fog, destroying a pontoon bridge and annihilating 3,000 enemies. Previously, a Soviet air squadron led by Zilikin discovered that the enemy had built a pontoon bridge and was attempting to cross the river. Zilikin was ordered to carry out a bombing mission. It happened to be heavily foggy at the time, so Soviet aircraft dropped flares and incendiary bombs. German anti-aircraft guns opened up with fierce fire, but the Soviet Air Force fearlessly flew low, first destroying the anti-aircraft gun positions, and then bombing enemy motorcycles and tanks, preventing them from crossing the river. The next morning, Soviet reinforcements arrived, and a large contingent of Soviet Air Force aircraft also arrived to assist, finally destroying the enemy pontoon bridge. The enemy suffered 3,000 casualties, losing 25 tanks, 20 artillery pieces, and many other war implements. The enemy's attempt to cross the river thus failed.

Reuters, Moscow, 1st – The weather at the front is now turning bad, especially on the northern and central fronts, so the German side appears determined to inflict a devastating blow on the Soviet army, or at least on the Soviet industrial areas, this month, even if it cannot be decisive. In the past few weeks, the German side has discovered that the Red Army is stronger than expected. In general, the fighting power of the Soviet army has not been significantly damaged. According to Soviet figures, German casualties have reached 2 million, which is not much different from what the German side admits, which is that German casualties are only about one-third of the Soviet losses of one million men. However, the claim that the Soviet army suffered 5 million casualties is obviously absurd. The strength of the Soviet army is quite strong, and it is good at avoiding destruction and encirclement, so in recent weeks, the German strategy seems to have shifted from the initial goal of destroying the Soviet army to merely weakening the Soviet Union's potential for combat. It is true that the German army has not reached the Moscow industrial area, but it has occupied most of the industrial and iron sand ore areas on the left bank of the Dnieper River. The Soviet army implemented destruction along the way, so that the German army could not use what it had captured. Although the Soviet side has also lost a part of the Ukrainian industry as a result, it is permissible that it is iron sand, and the work of a part of the coal and iron industry on the east bank of the Dnieper River will be stagnant due to the lack of iron sand. However, the Soviet side still has other iron sand mines and power plants that can replace the loss of the Krivoy Rog iron sand area and the Dnieper River hydroelectric power plant, so the central industrial area of the Soviet Union is not affected. The Red Army still has huge industrial resources. Judging from the German army's recent invasion of Gomel, the German side appears to be quite covetous of the Soviet industrial center. The Soviet army will definitely do its best to defend it. Not only from a military and popular morale point of view, but also from an industrial point of view, Leningrad is also quite important. The German side is determined to capture this city, but it is extremely difficult, so the German army may currently be satisfied with encircling the city and reducing its industrial output. If so, although it is a major blow to Soviet war production, it is still not a fatal blow. From this point of view, Britain and the United States must obviously prevent the loss and stagnation of Soviet industrial production in the coming months and make up for it.

Germans Admit Fierce New Red Army Counteroffensives Along Dnieper River Banks

United Press, Berlin, 1st – German military sources yesterday admitted that the Red Army had launched fierce new counteroffensives, with new troops joining the fighting along the Dnieper River in the central sector, but insisted that they were all destroyed by the German army. It is said that Leningrad has been simultaneously surrounded by German and Finnish troops. After the Finnish army occupied Vyborg, the determined resistance of the Soviet army has become even more intense. It is rumored that the Soviet army has buried extremely large mines in Leningrad and the outer defense zones, but the German army said that 1,100 mines have been discovered and destroyed by the German army in one day. In the past 24 hours, the Soviet army tried its best to land on the west bank of the Dnieper River, below Kiev, but the German official news agency said that several ships carrying soldiers were sunk before they could reach the shore.

What the German Army Has Gained in 71 Days Is Only One Vyborg Obtained by the Finnish Army

Reuters, London, 1st – A military affairs commentator said that what the German High Command can boast of on the 71st day of the war on the Eastern Front is the success of the Finnish army in capturing Vyborg and advancing in the Karelian Isthmus. As for the war situation between the Soviet and German armies, they did not say a word. The latest Soviet communiqué still only uses the term "fierce fighting on all fronts," and there is nothing to indicate that the German army has gotten closer to the Leningrad defense line, or that it has cut off the railway connecting the city to Moscow, as the German side claimed a few days ago. Reports from the northern, central, and southern fronts clearly indicate that the Soviet army has high morale. News from the southern region of Hungary and the Soviet army launched a large-scale counteroffensive. In the central region, the Soviet army led by General Nikov is attacking the German army north of Gomel. Odessa is apparently still holding firm. The Romanian army recently attacked the strong positions of the Soviet army in the city, but was repulsed with losses. The most noteworthy development above is the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini. The official announcement of the meeting did not reveal any information, but there is reason to believe that Hitler is currently pressing Mussolini to send more Italian "volunteer soldiers" to the Soviet front. The German army has suffered heavy losses, so Hitler must seriously study his manpower problems, so he has recently been frequently pressuring Hungary and other countries, and on the one hand, he is encouraging Finland to send more troops. The German soldiers who died or were injured on the Soviet front must be the most outstanding and most subservient to Nazism in the German army.

Reuters, Berlin, 1st – The Supreme Command communiqué said that since August 26, German troops have destroyed 27 Soviet shallow-water ships and warships on the Dnieper River north of Kiev. The port and city of Haapsalu on the west coast of Estonia have been occupied by the German army. In the battle of Tallinn, a total of 14,342 prisoners of war, 293 artillery pieces, 9 tanks, 2 armored trains, and a large amount of military supplies were captured. More than 20 ships were burned in the Finnish Gulf area.

Rumor of Soviet Retreat from Karelian Isthmus Has Important Political Significance

United Press, London, 1st – The Swedish correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph in Stockholm reported yesterday that Soviet troops have withdrawn from the entire Karelian Isthmus north of Leningrad. The correspondent said that Marshal Voroshilov had defensively abandoned everything from the forests above Ladoga to the massive defense structures on Kotin Island in the Gulf of Finland. Marshal Voroshilov has withdrawn from the Finnish-Soviet border to the Stalin Line. The news also said that this withdrawal has a political nature that is more important than its military nature, because Finland has recovered its lost territory, and the rumors that Finland and the Soviet Union have a separate peace are even more likely. The Soviet army's withdrawal from its old defense line, it is widely believed that this move shows that Moscow is willing to have a minor peace.

Reuters, Berlin, 1st – The German official news agency said, according to the Finnish news agency, reports in some foreign newspapers and radio stations that Finland, in view of the satisfaction with the results of its war of self-defense, has begun negotiations in Helsinki and Stockholm to induce a foreign leader to mediate peace between Finland and the Soviet Union, is completely groundless.

Mannerheim Sends Telegram to President After Capturing Vyborg, Expressing Joy

Havas, Helsinki, 1st – Finnish Army Commander-in-Chief Marshal Mannerheim sent a telegram to Finnish President Ryti after the Finnish army occupied Vyborg, saying: "I respectfully report the good news that our army has occupied Vyborg. The blue cross flag is flying again over this ancient city, indicating that our loyal and brave soldiers are ready to sacrifice everything to win glory for the motherland." The Finnish President also replied with a message of thanks, saying: "The good news that the Finnish flag is flying again over the ancient city of Vyborg has made every Finn feel infinitely pleased. The occupation of Vyborg heralds the bright future of our country and allows the people of Karelia to return to their homeland. On behalf of the Finnish people, the Finnish government, and myself personally, I extend my deepest gratitude to the liberators of Vyborg. I believe that our descendants will never forget this achievement."

Budyonny Calls on People to Rise Up Against Nazi Rule

Reuters, Moscow, 1st – A German-language appeal from General Budyonny, commander of the Soviet forces in southern Ukraine, to the German, Romanian, Hungarian, and Slovak soldiers, published yesterday, reads in part: "Come over to our side. Know that in the last world war, millions of your parents, brothers, and relatives were expelled and destroyed by German, Austrian, and Hungarian imperialism. As in the last war, turn your weapons against those who are driving you to your death. The lie that the Red Army is killing 'prisoners of war' is being spread. In fact, we will guarantee your life and safety, treat you well, and send you back to your homeland as soon as possible."

Reuters, Moscow, 1st – Soviet spokesman Lozovsky told foreign journalists yesterday that resistance to Nazi rule in the occupied countries has increased greatly. This resistance is manifested in partisan struggles, covert sabotage, and the ambushing of German agents and officers. The shooting of Laval would never have happened ten weeks ago, and there would never have been strikes in Poland before, but there have been strikes at the important railway junction of Tomaszów in Poland. The fact that the Red Army has heroically resisted ninety percent of the total strength of the German army for ten weeks and has inflicted heavy losses on Germany has raised the morale of the people in the ravaged occupied countries.

Kiev Youth Hold Meeting to Intensify Work and Attack Aggressors

TASS, Kiev, 1st – A meeting of all the youth of Kiev City was held on the 30th, and a demonstration was held. At the meeting, Captain Mikhamlov stated that the German side claimed to have occupied Kiev, and the audience responded with laughter. Mikhamlov said, "Countless soldiers and officers have lost confidence in victory, and rumors have failed to help Hitler." The people at the meeting shouted in unison, "Kiev will always be a Soviet city." The meeting passed a resolution, requesting all the youth in the city to intensify their work, consolidate national defense, and urge young patriots to join the People's Guard and the Fire Brigade Dare-to-Die Team, so that the end of Hitler's gang would come sooner."

Reuters, London, 1st – Soviet Ambassador Maisky said in a speech here yesterday, "We are determined to fight to the end, until Hitler's Germany is completely crushed. Our people are now holding great determination, fighting bravely, and will never compromise halfway, because we have no doubt about the final result. But what is the price? The Soviet people have suffered many losses and sacrifices in manpower, material, and territory. However, the Soviet people and the people here all know that the closest cooperation in military, economic, and political matters to the greatest extent possible between the British and Soviet people is the way to minimize these sacrifices. The closer the cooperation, the closer the date of victory and a fair and stable peace will be."

### Laval's Condition Shows Signs of Improvement

Reuters, London, 1st – German news agency Paris news, said that Laval and Déat's condition is indeed improving, Laval's temperature has dropped, can be considered out of danger.

TASS, Bern, 1st – The bullet fired by French patriotic youth Paul has become a call to arms for the French liberation movement. The anti-German movement has become more active, and the following slogans have been found everywhere: "Down with the Vichy government," "Kill all traitors of the motherland."

### Pétain Organizes Puppet Organizations

United Press, Vichy, 1st – Marshal Pétain, struggling to drive out anti-government factions, has made the anti-Jewish French veterans' group into a powerful political group and given it the power to stop the crisis and maintain order. Pétain, in a speech at the first anniversary of the founding of the group, said that he would replace the group with a national political party. Well-informed sources denied the rumor that the group would become an opponent of the Nazi vanguard.

### Weygand Announces Support for Pétain

Haitong Agency, Vichy, 1st – French government representative to Africa General Weygand wrote in the French police news weekly, "I have decided to implement the plan announced by Head of State Pétain in his August 12 speech. My first job is to establish an economic unit in the three parts of North Africa with political connections, namely Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. The three places must cooperate closely and carry out barter with the motherland. Head of State Pétain is an extremely sincere and clear-headed person who is respected by everyone, so we should unconditionally obey his orders."

### Large Numbers of British and American Aircraft Transported to the Soviet Union

United Press, Ankara, 1st – Military observers said today that, to their knowledge, some of the large numbers of British and American aircraft currently arriving in the Middle East will immediately cross Iran and transfer to the Soviet Union. Later, regular units of the Royal Air Force will assist the Soviet army in combat. They learned that a large amount of military supplies and raw materials are currently on their way to the Soviet Union.

### Germany Feels the Lack of Labor

Reuters, Somewhere in Europe, 1st – Judging from the news published in the German newspapers, Germany is already suffering from a lack of labor. For example, the "Frankfurter Zeitung" said that now that most Germans have had to put down their tools and take up rifles, the Jews in Warsaw can be ordered to work in German industries and be strictly monitored. The "Hamburg Gazette" suggested banning smoking in public vehicles because cleaning requires people, and there is currently a need for people to work elsewhere. According to the latest orders, Germany has had to recruit people with tuberculosis to work, and the regulations on preventing infectious diseases in factories have been relaxed. According to an official announcement on April 1 of this year, in addition to allocating 1.4 million prisoners of war to agriculture and industry, Germany has also recruited the same number of workers from European countries. Since then, according to Italian statistics, the number of Italian workers in Germany has doubled, reaching 300,000 today. Germany also admits that the number of Dutch workers in Germany has increased from 90,000 on April 1 to 233,000 today, and the number of Belgian workers has increased from 87,000 to 160,000.

### Chongqing University President Ye Yuanlong's Robbery Encounter

(Chongqing Air News) Ye Yuanlong, President of Chongqing University, has been having a run of bad luck. Last year, he was robbed, incurring significant losses, and the perpetrators have yet to be apprehended. Just last week, he was robbed again. The main campus of Chongqing University is located dozens of miles from the city. Although the area is densely populated, the public security situation is quite different from that in the city. Ye's residence is very close to the school, and he is accustomed to going early and returning late every day. On this particular evening, Ye was engrossed in reading when he suddenly heard a knocking sound at the door. He put down his book, opened the door, and went out to greet the guest, but the person was unfamiliar. Just as he was about to ask for their name, the visitor

abruptly told him to be silent, and three people entered the house one after another, locking the door from the inside. Ye realized what was happening and remained silent. The three men asked Mr. Ye to lead the way and entered the living room. Since the guests were polite, Ye had no choice but to offer them the seat of honor. One of them said, "Brothers are in dire straits and wish to return to their hometown but lack travel funds. We humbly ask for a loan; we have no intention of alarming you, sir." Ye chuckled bitterly and said, "I am honored by your esteemed visit. People often mock scholars as 'impoverished,' as you well know, but you overestimate my worth. However, professors today are known as 'teaching-lean,' as their condition is evident. I deeply regret not having much to offer." Upon hearing the term "teaching-lean," the robbers were

greatly surprised and asked for its meaning. Seeing an opportunity to speak, Ye launched into a discourse on wartime economic principles, saying that under the current circumstances, everyone should endure hardship in order to achieve victory. Even school presidents and professors like himself were experiencing living conditions vastly different from the past, yet they were able to endure it. At this point, he pointed to the earthenware utensils displayed on the table to illustrate his point, saying, "In the past, we used Western porcelain for tea, but now we use these clay items, and even if they are

broken and chipped, we dare not discard them." Upon hearing this, the three men exchanged glances, their expressions changing. Ye sensed this and continued, "We have been in Sichuan for three years and have not made a single new set of clothes. Now, please allow me to open the suitcases to show you." He opened each of the trunks in the room, revealing layers of patched underwear and clothing. The robbers sighed, "Mr. Ye is

indeed living in poverty." Ye replied, "That is not entirely true," and took out a fox fur coat from the chest. He then asked the robbers, "How much is this worth?" The robbers could not answer. Ye said, "This is an heirloom from my ancestors. It would be too extravagant to wear it after the war, but it is a pity to discard it. I have long been at a loss for what to do with it. Besides the worn-out carpet in this humble abode, this is the only item that can be considered a treasure. I offer it as a gift, but I fear it is not enough to impress you." The robbers were overjoyed to receive the fur coat,

thanked him profusely, and immediately took their leave, disappearing without a trace in an instant. The next day, a friend said to Ye, "If you had not shown them the fox fur coat, the thugs might have demanded gold and silver. It is a pity you were so hasty. However, the study of wartime economics has found its application in such a situation, so your learning has not been in vain." Upon hearing this, Ye clapped his hands and praised the idea.

### Grand Opening of the Leipzig Trade Fair

Haitong News Agency, Leipzig, one day – The autumn trade fair of this year opened on Saturday. The number of exhibitors is 6,625 units, compared to only 6,232 units last year. The number of foreign participants has also greatly increased. In addition, there are group exhibitions from nineteen foreign countries.

Haitong News Agency, Leipzig, one day – At a reception for German and foreign journalists, Goebbels declared that Germany's enemies possess a large amount of material, exceeding their needs. Their aim is to control all raw materials and dominate humanity. Today, Germany and other European countries are fighting hand in hand to secure sufficient living space. Germany's economic goals for Europe are to eliminate plutocracy, create a clearing system, and unify European economic and price policies. A united Europe will undoubtedly create a powerful economic zone that cannot be shaken by external forces. After the war, Europe will become an important market for trade with overseas countries. A third of the world's raw materials, food, and other manufactured goods were originally shipped to Europe. Therefore, any attempt to paralyze Europe's economic power is a crime against the entire world economy. The policy of the European continent to ensure the supply of its vital resources is beyond doubt. Therefore, the future economic policy of Europe will undoubtedly increase the sales of goods from various countries.

### Iran Under Anglo-Soviet Control

Land and People

Before 1935, Iran was Persia, famous in history. Two thousand five hundred years ago, Persia was a great power spanning Europe and Asia. For 2,500 years, Persia was the battlefield of Eurasian peoples. Two thousand five hundred years later, Persia—today's Iran—has once again become the center of the war.

Iran stands on the entire western part of the Iranian plateau; its entire territory is built on a high plateau. Its capital, Tehran, is on a plateau 1,000 meters above sea level. The average elevation of the entire country is 1,200 meters; only the coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea have relatively low terrain. The country is surrounded by towering peaks, and the interior contains salt deserts that account for one-third of the country's land. There are only a few small rivers and flat coastlines. The summers are scorching, and the winters are extremely cold. It possesses vast amounts of treasure—oil.

Because it is a place that has long been influenced by ancient civilizations, and because it is a key transportation route in Eurasia, it is not only a battlefield for nations but also a place where nations intermingle. In addition to the fact that more than half of the population are Persians, there are Kurds, Armenians, and Arabs in the west. In the northeast, there are Turkic people (of Turkish descent) from Soviet Turkestan. Along the Persian Gulf coast are Arabs and black people, who are remnants of the conquests of Persia by Tatars, Arabs, and Turks from the 10th to the 18th centuries. Today, there is a population of 15 million people.

Anglo-Russian Division of Influence

Thirty years ago, during the First World War in Europe, the German-Turkish allied forces attempted to pass through Persia to invade India, but Persia at that time was completely under the control of Britain and Russia, and the plan failed.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Britain and Russia had railway disputes in Persia. Russia wanted to build a railway from its Transcaucasia to the Persian Gulf in order to obtain an ice-free port. Britain wanted to build a railway connecting Europe to India. In 1907, Britain and Russia reached an agreement to divide Persia into two spheres of influence: the north was assigned to Russia, and the south along the Persian Gulf was assigned to Britain.

When the Great War broke out in 1914, Persia was a neutral country, but in addition to the presence of Russian and British troops in their respective spheres of influence, Germany and Turkey also took the opportunity to occupy part of the country. After the success of the Russian October Revolution in 1917, the revolutionary government announced the abolition of the Anglo-Russian agreement and abandoned the interests of the old Russia. After the end of the war, Persia was entirely within Britain's sphere of influence. In 1919, Britain and Persia concluded an agreement that allowed the British to have political and military influence in Persia, and the British government selected experts and military personnel to help Persia with construction, supply railway materials, and provide huge loans, using customs duties and other taxes as collateral.

Britain's influence in Persia was soon eliminated by a new leader, Reza Khan. This leader was originally an officer in the Persian Cossack Brigade in northern Persia. Starting as a soldier, he led the gradually gaining momentum nationalist movement. In February 1921, he led his troops into Tehran, the capital of Persia, and the Persian king appointed him as Minister of War and Commander-in-Chief. In 1922, he was promoted to Prime Minister, and all power was in his hands. The following year, the Persian king, seeing that the situation was hopeless, abdicated and left the country, and Reza Khan became the de facto ruler. He reorganized the army, restored order in Persia, and implemented nationalist and modernization policies. Although his ideas were novel, he did not want to emulate the radical policies of Turkey's Kemal to completely reform society, and the democratic movement was only a flash in the pan. In 1925, the Persian parliament passed a resolution with a unanimous vote to make him the king of Persia.

After Reza Khan took the throne, his first act was to expel all British and Swedish advisers. The second was to reorganize the Persian army, strictly enforce regulations, replenish military equipment, quell internal turmoil, develop the country's industry, and exploit the vast oil fields in the northeastern Persian Gulf region.

In 1926, he concluded a treaty of friendship with Turkey, and in 1927, he concluded treaties of friendship with the Soviet Union and Afghanistan. The Pact of Saadabad in 1934 established political ties between Turkey, Persia, Iraq, and Afghanistan.

In 1935, the Persian government notified all countries that Persia was renamed "Iran."

Strategic Position

Since Germany attacked the Soviet Union, it had expected to use a "blitzkrieg" tactic to force the Soviet Union to its knees in a matter of weeks, seizing the granary of Ukraine, the oil of Transcaucasia, and threatening Britain's lifeline—India—from the rear. However, its dream was shattered by the two-month resistance of the Red Army. Germany is advantageous in a quick war, but its own conditions limit its ability to prolong the war. In order to remedy the situation, it sought another way out to Asia Minor. On the one hand, it made preparations for military action against Turkey at any time, and on the other hand, it actively carried out activities within Iran, using the old contradictions between Britain, the Soviet Union, and Iran to draw Iran into its embrace.

Britain and the Soviet Union preemptively took joint action and marched troops into Iran on the morning of the 25th, occupying important strongholds. This has a decisive effect on the consolidation of the entire Soviet front and the defense of India. (Si Zai)

Commercial News

### Cotton Yarn: Uncertain International News; More Sellers in the Yarn Market

The yarn market, after fluctuating for two days, has turned downward. Although the market price of Double Horse factory singles has fallen, the situation is still relatively stable. This is because they should have risen greatly in the past, and the price of rice was unable to follow, so the degree of decline is also minimal. However, the bearish trend in the yarn auctioned on the exchange is extremely strong. In just a few days, it has plummeted by over 120 yuan from its peak. The sudden drop is said to be due to the on-again, off-again US-Japan negotiations, which have filled the market with an atmosphere of peace. Speculators have become very active and have shifted towards selling, causing the market to decline step by step. At the same time, sales by Hong Kong firms have also been lighter than before. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,695 yuan, the low price was 1,675 yuan, the opening price in the afternoon was 1,676 yuan, gradually rising to 1,684 yuan. After hearing that the exchange price had fallen, it followed the decline to 1,663 yuan, with a closing price of 1,673 yuan.

The Double Horse morning opening was still favorable, as sellers were not prevalent. The opening price was 1,685 yuan. However, speculators, seeing the tightness of spot goods, mostly ate up the bullish profits, pushing it up to 1,695 yuan. Then, upon hearing that the exchange opening was up, the price suddenly fell back by more than ten yuan. People were panicky, and selling became slightly stronger, falling to 1,680 yuan. Some large firms in the same industry were in bullish positions, but securities firms and outsiders were selling out. It was heard that cash prices were high, rising to 1,889 yuan. However, as the atmosphere of peace in the market intensified and the exchange closing plunged, selling became rampant again, falling to a closing price of 1,675 yuan. It is estimated that 6,530 bales were traded in half a day. The amount of purchases by various firms is listed as follows: Hong Kong 10, Mainland 20, and other firms 6,500. Total: 6,530.

The Golden Double Horse futures market fluctuated and was unstable in an atmosphere of uncertainty. At the morning opening, although US cotton rose steadily, it failed to affect people's sentiment. Factory singles did not stabilize first, and then the exchange forced the price down, causing futures yarn to turn soft from firm. The phenomenon of rising prices was rare during the trading. Therefore, the September contract opened at 1,600 yuan, an initial decrease of four yuan. The October contract was 1,632 yuan, a gain of nine yuan. The November contract was 1,652 yuan, a gain of eight yuan. Later, rumors spread frequently, causing the bulls to waver, and sellers took the opportunity to rise. For a time, the trading floor was controlled by the bears. However, as spot short sellers took profits and made successive purchases, the price rose slightly near the noon closing. Therefore, the closing prices for near-term and deferred-term contracts had small discrepancies. In the afternoon, news was unfavorable, and the exchange did not turn around, causing the bulls to become wary and less aggressive. As factory singles plunged sharply at one point, futures yarn became even less attractive and gradually fell. The September contract once fell as low as 1,585 yuan, the October contract fell to 1,612 yuan, and the November contract also fell slightly to 1,622 yuan. Due to the rise in factory singles, the deferred-term contract closed at 1,643 yuan, only a slight increase of one yuan. The October contract was 1,617 yuan and five jiao, a slight decrease of five yuan and five jiao. The September contract was 1,586 yuan, a significant drop of eighteen yuan. Therefore, observing the trends, large firms generally adopted a wait-and-see approach due to the uncertainty of foreign news, while retail investors sold off due to the impact of rumors. Therefore, the future of yarn is still largely dependent on foreign developments. A total of 20,770 bales were traded throughout the day, an increase of 3,850 bales from the previous day. As of August 31, the total amount in storage for three months was 23,670 bales, including 7,150 bales for September, 9,640 bales for October, and 6,880 bales for November. The largest short positions were held by numbers 37, 11, 35, 67, and 34, each shorting 2,940 bales. The largest long positions were held by numbers 19, 14, 49, 61, and 33, each holding 2,490 bales. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the day are recorded on the left (net prices).

### Cotton Market Turns Quiet; Stockpilers Still Unwilling to Sell Cheaply

The Shanghai foreign cotton market is quiet but firm, but actual transactions are still quite flat. In recent days, the reason for the lukewarm attitudes of both factories and cotton merchants towards ordering foreign cotton is that the large batches of American, Indian, or Brazilian cotton purchased previously have not yet arrived in Shanghai as scheduled, resulting in a lack of financial flexibility. At the same time, the application procedures required to order foreign cotton in the future are more cumbersome than before and subject to certain restrictions, creating a lack of confidence in the overall business. In addition, due to the remoteness of shipping schedules, the voyage from the US to Shanghai, which used to take a month, now takes more than two months. Therefore, it is not surprising that, apart from two or three factories and cotton merchants who have some interest in purchasing California or Brazilian cotton, the rest are adopting a wait-and-see approach.

The spot cotton market is also softening due to the decline in the yarn market. At the same time, prices have reached a peak, and a reaction has led to a temporary decline. However, stockpilers are generally unwilling to sell off their goods cheaply. It is currently difficult to see prices rise. Transactions include the Huashang Xinyu Yarn Factory purchasing 500 bales of Nanshi Taicang cotton at a factory price of 294 yuan, and cotton merchants purchasing 200 bales of Yuyao cotton at a stack price of 278 yuan. These are all transactions of coarse cotton; there have been no transactions of fine cotton such as Mitlin or Brazilian cotton.

### Finance: Importers Eagerly Settle Foreign Exchange

The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no changes in the prices quoted by HSBC and small counters. The black market price of the US dollar was still 4.9375 yuan. The black market for British and US dollars initially eased but then suddenly tightened. Continuing the easing trend from Saturday, US dollars were settled at 5.03125 yuan and British pounds at 2/96875. Importers, seeing the low prices, made settlements, and electricity companies settled a large amount for coal, causing the market to soften. The US dollar returned within the 5 yuan range. In the afternoon, it tightened further as banks were reluctant to sell and importers were even more eager to buy, pushing the closing price to 03125 for British pounds, calculated as 2/90625, and 125 for US dollars, at 4.875 yuan. Transactions were not frequent.

Coal Settlements Even More Active

From the morning, the British and American foreign exchange markets at HSBC were inactive, and the Indian silver market did not change. The exchange rates of various countries also remained unchanged. The official exchange rates were flat. The spot prices opened higher in the domestic market, with banks' selling prices immediately hardening. British pounds were at 2/96875 and US dollars at 5.03125, both rising by 03125. Foreign firms were only able to settle a small amount at the above prices. When HSBC quoted its rates, the foreign exchange rates had not changed, and the silver equalization tax was still at 24.50%. At that time, under the settlements made by electricity companies and importers, the US dollar was only at 5 yuan. Near noon, it further retreated within the range, with paper money at 4.96875 yuan. Foreign banks were even less willing to supply, and the US dollar softened to 4.9375 yuan at noon, and British pounds to 2/9375.

US Dollar Advances to Within 5 Yuan

In the afternoon, banks were even less willing to supply, but importers, regardless of the price, made frantic purchases. Spot US dollars were only at 4.875 yuan. At the closing time of almost 3:30, spot and September forward British exchange was at 2/90625 and US dollars at 4.875, a tightening of 03125 for British pounds and 125 for US dollars compared to the noon closing on Saturday.

### Spot Copper Trading Market Still Awaits; Cash is Plentiful for Scouring

The black market for copper yesterday saw no new trading in the October contract. When asked about the copper positions of Lianyi firms, it was said that the opening of the new standard settlement price would have to wait until after the first meeting of the Stabilization Fund in Hong Kong. Therefore, the market was still trading spot goods. The situation fell and then rose, once retreating to the 9,000 yuan mark, and then gradually leaping out of the 9,100 yuan range, due to the scouring by gold firms and securities firms. As the black market for foreign exchange tightened, it stirred up people's sentiment in all directions. It opened 70 yuan lower in the morning, with Xianghe selling 30 taels to Jinyuan and 20 taels to Tianyuan for 9,000 yuan, when US dollars could be settled at 5.03125 yuan. Suddenly, it turned soft, and prices also rose. Dajinyuan and Xianghe repurchased, and the securities firm Defu scrambled to buy, gradually rising. At 10:05, Defu purchased 50 taels from Hengji for 9,100 yuan. Xianghe purchased 500 to 600 taels, and continued to purchase, also purchasing 20 taels from Yang Qinghe. But soon, it resold 50 taels to Shunyuan, and the price had risen to 9,140 yuan. Xiangxing Yongtu sold off, and the price turned down at noon. Gonghe sold 20 taels to Chengji for 9,120 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the early afternoon, there were sellers at 9,100 yuan, but when it was shouted down to 9,090 yuan, there were still few counterparties. Buyers then offered 9,070 yuan, and no deals were made. The price finally reached 9,080 yuan, 10 yuan higher than the end of last week. The price difference for the whole day was 140 yuan, and 1,700 to 1,800 taels were traded. The retail price of gold from the gold shops was 9,

150 yuan, with a discount of 200 yuan for purchases. There was no market for the current spot gold price.

Ornamental Gold Up Ten Yuan

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops was raised by ten yuan by Datonghang and other shops at 11 AM, to 930 yuan, with a discount of 50 yuan for purchases.

### What I Saw and Heard Yesterday: Yuan Notes and Jiao Notes

Yesterday, I observed trams and buses in the British and French concessions, and there were no problems with the exchange of banknotes as usual. I have not seen any instances of customers being chased away for asking for change. However, there were a few soldiers in military vehicles in one concession who shouted that customers with one-yuan notes should not board. In the public concession, the attitude of ticket sellers has been much more moderate than before, which is also an improvement. Insulting customers is certainly not something that should happen in business. Although banks claim to be maintaining the currency's value, this has not been seen in practice. If you don't believe me, you can try to exchange them, and you will be refused. If the banking sector is truly sincere in adjusting the situation, why not provide convenience directly to citizens as much as possible, instead of letting tobacco shops control the situation? What is the reason for this? Currently, tobacco shops openly refuse to exchange five-yuan notes for one-jiao notes, or even if you buy two or three jiao worth of goods and pay with one yuan, they will ask a lot of questions, and sometimes they simply refuse to give change. On the one hand, they post red paper strips, charging a certain amount per hundred yuan for one-jiao coins. Since they are unwilling to exchange the one-jiao notes they receive, what do they use them for? But why do the note-issuing banks that issue four-character banknotes, as well as the friends in general big banks' vaults and counters, also treat one-yuan notes and one-jiao notes as rare commodities, unwilling to use them to serve customers, to balance surpluses and deficits? The greatest function of currency is to benefit the people. Is this practice our way of innovating and implementing the "rounding" method?

### American Dollar Spot and Forward Trading

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds rise and then level off. The trend for British gold notes was stable, and the market price was level. The market for American dollar notes began to engage in spot and forward trading. The opening price was 20 yuan and 9 jiao. After the opening, Qiaotaiyong and others sold off, retreating to 7 jiao and 6 fen. Lemayli, Taixing, Qiaotaiyong, and others purchased, raising it to 21 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen. Yixing, Yintai, and others sold off, and the noon closing retreated to 20 yuan and 9 jiao and a half. The afternoon opening was at 9 jiao and 8 fen. After the opening, Yintai, Yixing, and others bought in, raising it to 21 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen. Lemay sold out, and the closing was at 21 yuan and 1 jiao. Hong Kong notes continued to weaken, while Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both trended sharply downward. The former retreated to 2 yuan and 5 jiao and 2 fen, and the latter fell to 1 yuan and 8 jiao and 8 fen.

### Silver Reserve Association's Remittance Deposits

—No Interest from August—

The Shanghai Banking Association's Joint Reserve Committee announced that, starting in August, no interest would be paid on the remittance deposits of fellow members (including clearing banks). The interbank lending rate for money shops in August remained at 2 yuan, the same as in July.

### Shendezhuang Joins the Clearing

The Shanghai Banking Association's Joint Reserve Committee sent a letter to each clearing bank yesterday, stating that Shendezhuang Money Shop joined the money warehouse as a member on August 26. Starting in September, each bank receiving payment instruments from Shendezhuang would entrust the Association with collecting payment on its behalf, following the same procedures as other member shops.

### Food: People's Lucky Star; Rice Prices Decline Step by Step

Yesterday, the decline in foreign rice prices did not stop, and selling became even more active. The peace rumors were unfavorable to all parties, and both the new currency and the legal foreign exchange were enough to restrain rice prices on a smooth path. In addition, the official sale of small sizes had officially been reduced by three yuan yesterday, and there were even rumors of further reductions. Therefore, large firms were timid, and each party's current and futures foreign rice was under pressure to sell. The price of small sizes once fell to 110 yuan per stone, 7 yuan lower than the official selling price. The current small sizes sold by Yinghua Company were also at 132.50 yuan to 132 yuan, while the road goods were still trying to defend their prices, at 142 yuan to 141 yuan. The road goods of Siam No. 2 also fell slightly to 126 yuan, but the prices of the later forms did not stabilize. Yinghua Company traded 700 tons. The number of current rice transactions was only about 100 bags due to the addition of new guests this week and some additions at low prices. Spot No. 1 Saigon high-grade rice initially sold for 128 yuan, but then only for 25 yuan. No. 2 Siamese rice was initially priced at 112 yuan, but fell to 109 yuan. Small sizes from the bank stack fell from 113 yuan to 111.50 yuan, and small sizes from the outer stack fell from 112 yuan to 110.05 yuan. Middle-grade rice from Min Dang was only 115 yuan, and broken tips were 87 or 88 yuan.

The thick and thin japonica rice prices were still firm due to the scarcity and the strong demand from local shops, so the selling price remained stable without much change. Early rice from Nangang was priced from 160 yuan to 157 yuan, Wuxi original-packed special japonica rice was 156 yuan, the general market was 150 yuan, and the old price was 144 to 145 yuan. The supply and demand for new japonica rice from Pudong were also similar, and there was little difference in price, selling for 158 yuan. However, the special goods, due to their scarcity and fragrance, and their superior quality, were priced at 162 yuan yesterday.

Glutinous rice was long since new merchandise from domestic sources, but the market still only had general Hong Kong yuan. Therefore, when the price of foreign rice plummeted, the impact was also difficult to sustain, and it fell by about 2 yuan, priced from 127 yuan to 122 or 123 yuan. Glutinous tea was priced from 114 yuan to 110 yuan.

Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Shipping's Zhangjiakou ship arrived in port the day before yesterday (Saturday) and unloaded 6,449 bags of foreign rice from Siam. Another 3,370 bags of foreign rice arrived via Xianggang and were unloaded at the Muddy Road wharf in Pudong. (Zu)

### Hoarders Aware of Unfavorable Situation, Foreign Flour Being Dumped in Large Quantities

Yesterday, in addition to being affected by the ongoing mediation between the U.S. and Japan regarding foreign flour, and due to pressure from certain banknotes and the foreign exchange equalization relationship, major hoarders with stock on hand felt the unfavorable environment and tried to dump their holdings in large quantities. More than a million bags of flour were clogging the market, and shipments continued to arrive frequently. Although new transactions were not dared to be considered, Chinese and foreign merchants were still hawking their wares, leading to the U.S. "Campbell" flour's legally converted foreign exchange price falling below thirty yuan. Consequently, selling pressure surged after the market opened. The "Golden Dragon" brand had a relatively large stockpile on the market. The Western warehouses opened prices already at thirty yuan and five cents, followed by a drop below the thirty yuan mark, hitting a low of twenty-nine yuan and three cents. Eastern warehouses dropped to thirty yuan. The small price triggered retail purchases and replenishment. The Western "Golden Dragon" warehouses rebounded to twenty-nine yuan and nine cents, the Eastern warehouses to thirty yuan and three cents. However, this was still a decrease of seven or eight cents compared to the previous day. The U.S. flour warehouses had thinner stockpiles. The "Paotai" flour dropped from thirty-one yuan and nine and a half cents to thirty-one yuan and three cents, closing at thirty-one yuan and seven and a half cents. "Banana" flour rose from thirty yuan and six cents to thirty-one yuan and three cents. Only about 10,000 bags were traded. Wood flour was scarce, and sellers were unwilling to lower prices. Only wheat bran was being dumped by hoarders. "Sanxin" wheat bran dropped to thirty-two yuan and six cents.

The wheat market was even quieter. The amount of goods arriving from the suburbs in recent days has slightly increased compared to before, but the drop in rice flour prices has softened people's hearts. Although the factory retail prices have not changed and remain at forty-eight yuan, they are being quite strict with the selection of goods.

### Soybeans Flood the Market, Seeking Sale

Large quantities of soybeans have arrived, and samples were already offered for sale yesterday. Therefore, general hoarding was impossible, and people were forced to sell at the same rate, causing a sudden surge in selling. Buyers suddenly declared themselves unable to handle it, and there is a trend of a sharp decline in the future. It is estimated that 250 bags of Guide soybeans, and 150 bags each of Changzhou "Niupi Huang" and "Niupi Qing" soybeans were sold, with prices falling sharply by about two yuan each compared to before. Most of the remaining deals were discussed but not finalized. Furthermore, 2,635 bags of soybeans were shipped to Singapore today.

### Oil Market: Edible Oil Panic Gradually Subsides

Shipments of raw soybean oil arrived one after another. Yesterday, another 1,800 barrels were transported by Anxing, along with 1,000 cans of raw oil. More than 2,000 barrels are also on the way. Therefore, the atmosphere of panic has already disappeared. Although many holders of rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil are still fighting hard like trapped beasts, they ultimately feel powerless to support the market and are gradually trending downward. As a result, prices fell sharply again by as much as seven or eight yuan compared to before. It is estimated that more than 2,000 loads of clear oil from Dayou Factory, 600 loads of Xacha rapeseed oil, and more than 4,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from Rihua and Taishan factories were sold (prices are detailed in the market price column).

### Securities: Fierce Competition in Domestic Bonds

The gray market for government bonds initially turned lower from stable yesterday. Class C bonds broke the one-yuan mark, followed by major players lifting the price, raising Class C bonds again to one yuan and nine cents, seeing new highs. Afterwards, it fell back six cents. The sudden rise and fall of the strips showed an increasingly fierce competition between bulls and bears. The spread of "air" was enough to help the market rise. The shorts believed it was not credible, and everyone did their own thing. It is currently difficult to determine. For the time being, the bulls' interest is extremely strong, and they may not give up quickly. Yesterday morning, Xinfu's buying interest remained strong. Yongchang, Delong, Yitai, Jiucheng, Jiufeng, and Chengji all bought in. Dazhong Lemao exited and re-entered, in large quantities. Renchang, Lianyi, Runli, Runde, Huishun, De Fu were all sellers. The morning closed well, up half a yuan. Class C saw a new high price of seventy-one yuan and nine cents. The afternoon opening was slightly weak. Xinfu's buying interest remained strong. Chengji and Delong also absorbed more. Runli replenished. Hengkang and Dechang also came to buy. Class C saw seventy-one yuan and nine cents again. Later, Yongchang switched to selling, and Renchang's selling was also very strong. In addition, Xiexing, Yuanrun, Dehe, and Feng all disposed of their holdings. The market price fell back six cents again. The rise and fall were erratic, with a difference of more than one yuan and four cents between the high and low prices. The intensity of the competition was unprecedented. As a result, the market saw both high and low prices fluctuate by several cents. The total turnover was about two million six hundred thousand yuan. A concise table is listed below.

In stock trading, 50 shares of Huashang Securities Exchange were traded at a price of forty yuan each.

Also, the stock market of the Public Business Association was still extremely excited at the beginning of the week, and the price was much higher than the previous close. Although there was a small rebound in the afternoon, there were still many who bought at the lower prices. The closing activity did not diminish, and the underlying momentum was good.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fall Back

Yesterday, the sugar market softened due to the rise in foreign exchange and the imminent arrival of goods in transit, falling back by three yuan to one yuan. The association's pegged prices for spot 24 crude white sugar for August import were one hundred twenty-five yuan and five cents, one hundred twenty-five yuan for July, twenty-four yuan, and twenty-four yuan and four cents, down two yuan and eight cents to six cents.

### Piece Goods: Fabric Market Uneasy

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market fluctuated because of the sudden deterioration of the situation to a serious stage. People's hearts were turbulent, but the actual sales needs in various places were still present, so the price of goods was even more elusive. Fugui fine cloth opened at fifty-three yuan, falling step by step to fifty-one yuan. The evening closing price was fifty-two yuan and five cents. First-grade coarse and fine twill cloth also fell two and a half to five cents. Many types of bleached and dyed cloth still opened at the original prices, with some falling by about five cents.

### Hall Patch Travels South to Attend Equalization Conference to Discuss Fundamental Solutions for Managing the Foreign Exchange Market; Black Market Remains Stable and Margin Still Suspended

Regarding thorough measures to eliminate speculation and arbitrage in the Shanghai market, the Equalization Fund Committee is deliberating. It is expected that after the arrival of Mr. Taylor, a U.S. helper, and the two general managers of Citibank and Magill, a second meeting could be convened immediately to quickly reach a decision. However, as American committee member Fox went to Manila on official business, there has been a slight delay. According to information obtained here yesterday, Mr. Fox will soon return to Hong Kong. British committee member Hall Patch left by the American President Lines ship "President Garfield" at 4:30 yesterday morning to Hong Kong. The Hong Kong meeting, which is drawing attention from all parties, should be convened in the shortest possible time to discuss solutions for managing the Shanghai foreign exchange market.

Stable Foreign Exchange Rate and Falling Prices

Yesterday morning, the black market exchange rate was slightly looser than the closing rate on Saturday. The black market selling prices of various banks were transacted between the banks based on the standard of four yuan and nine cents and three-seventy-five to the U.S. dollar, at twenty yuan and two dimes and five cents of legal tender per U.S. dollar, but the transaction volume was not high. In the afternoon, it tightened slightly (see the commercial news of this newspaper for details). The timber, stock, and commodity markets were active yesterday morning as the market eased, but later fluctuated, with many trending downward. The unconfirmed "peace" atmosphere triggered selling pressure in the cotton yarn market.

Margin Trading Continues to be Suspended: According to the English newspaper "Dayaun," the Shanghai Margin Exchange was quite chaotic at the end of last week because of the settlement price for August. The shorts firmly insisted on basing the settlement price on the official exchange rate of HSBC's U.S. exchange rate of five yuan and three dimes and one and two-tenths cents (i.e., the exchange rate provided by the Equalization Fund), while the longs firmly insisted on basing the settlement price on the local black market exchange rate. Neither side would give in. It was not until this morning (the 1st) that the two sides finally reached an amicable solution, stipulating that the settlement price should be a compromise price of 6,765 yuan per ten-ounce bar of margin, which was 200 yuan higher than the shorts had fought for, but far lower than the price sought by the longs. This morning, the margin trading community continued to meet to discuss new measures so that the empty margin trading could proceed, but they were unable to reach a final decision on which exchange rate to use as the basis for future transactions between the official and black market exchange rates. At the same time, the margin market had to continue to suspend trading.

New Import and Export Measures Issued by the Ministry

The Ministry of Finance announced on the 28th that the measures for prohibiting the import of goods during the extraordinary period promulgated in July, as well as the measures for the settlement of foreign exchange for export goods and the receipt of foreign exchange price differences, and the measures for prohibiting the import of goods and the use of import licenses, the measures for cracking down on the sale of prohibited import goods, the measures for reporting and shipping export goods for foreign exchange settlement, the measures for implementing the settlement of foreign exchange for postal parcels, the measures for revising the restrictions on reporting and transshipment of export goods, and the measures for using gasoline import licenses were abolished by the Ministry's order yesterday. In addition, revised measures for prohibiting the import of goods during the extraordinary period, measures for cracking down on the sale of prohibited import goods, and measures for the settlement of foreign exchange for export goods that should be settled in foreign exchange have been telegraphed to the Director-General of Customs, Mr. Meyer, to be forwarded to customs offices throughout the country for compliance, and the four banks, Zhongzhong, Jiaonong, and other banks, have been notified to handle the matter in accordance with the newly announced measures.

### Yesterday was Journalist Day, Reporters are More Loyal

Yesterday was the 91 Journalist Day, and journalists across the country celebrated as usual. The Shanghai market did not hold any celebrations due to the special environment. Newspapers and news agencies did not take holidays either and worked as usual. Yesterday noon, all the reporters in the city stood silently for three minutes to mourn their colleagues who died for the country since the incident, in order to express their condolences. At the same time, they were all more loyal to supporting national policies and completing the great cause of national rejuvenation, and they were determined to work hard at their posts to fulfill the sacred duty of a reporter.

### The Situation in Tokyo is Easing, the United States and Britain Continue to Evacuate Nationals: Britain Will Send a Special Ship to Japan to Evacuate Nationals; Japanese Newspapers Believe It Will Only Increase Tensions

The "Zilin Bao" correspondent in Tokyo on August 31 stated that after Japanese Prime Minister Konoe sent a letter to U.S. President Roosevelt, and after President Roosevelt spoke with Japanese envoy Nomura, the atmosphere of slight danger here seemed to be decreasing again today. Everyone believes that the U.S. President and the Japanese envoy may have agreed to avoid the foolish act of starting a war. Foreigners are experiencing difficulties leaving Japan, apparently because Japanese ships have insufficient cabin space and departure regulations are becoming more stringent. Japanese newspapers accuse the evacuation of nationals as intending to increase tensions in the Pacific, but in reality, the Japanese side has not taken any direct action to reassure British nationals here. According to a British Embassy official, the evacuation of British nationals is limited to the announcement and nothing else. At the same time, the previous advice to British nationals who do not have urgent business in Japan to leave as soon as possible is still valid. It is estimated that there are a total of thousands of British nationals living in Japan and Northeast China, including wives and children, who wish to leave the country, and the number is quite large. At the same time, for the same reasons as British nationals, American nationals are also continuing to leave in groups of three or five for Shanghai and Manila. Recently, British nationals traveling to Britain who leave Japan on Japanese ships have encountered increasing difficulties. British Ambassador Sir Craig finally requested the British government to send a British ship to evacuate the large number of nationals who wished to leave as soon as possible. London has granted the request. This is the first British ship to evacuate nationals. Washington sent several ships to evacuate American nationals months ago. The dispatch of the first British ship to evacuate nationals can be used to make an interesting comparison of British and American policies.

### All-America China Relief Association: Recent Activities; 30 Million Quinine Pills Being Shipped to China for Relief

New York News: According to the New York Branch of the All-America China Relief Association, it recently received a telegram from the Younei Relief Agency stating that 30 million quinine pills, which were previously shipped back to the country by the American Medical Aid to China Association, an important member of the association, to relieve malaria, 7 million pills have arrived last week, and said that 66% of the patients recuperating in hospitals in Yunnan Province have contracted malaria due to being stung by poisonous centipedes there. Although Madame Chiang has donated 10,000 mosquito nets on behalf of the National Women's Relief Association for protection, there is a great shortage of medical supplies. When all 30 million pills donated by the association are received in the future, the benefits to relief will be considerable.

Young Overseas Chinese Honored in the United States

Overseas Chinese youth artist Jiang Jingdong recently won the first prize in the All-American Youth Art Competition held by an American magazine, and was awarded US$1,000 by the magazine, and was also sponsored to travel around the United States to visit art academies for further study. Recently, Jiang Jun and several of his teachers and friends traveled to New York and came to the All-America China Relief Association to automatically propose to help the China Relief movement. According to American magazines, Jiang Jun is 18 years old and his father is a barber who runs a barbershop in Portland, near the province of Kernly. Jiang Jun was able to draw on the outer walls of the shop for fun when he was only three years old. His childhood creations were appreciated by adults nearby. After entering school, he worked hard to imitate drawings, and after more than ten years, his art has greatly improved. In this All-American Art Competition, 57,173 young male and female artists participated in the competition, and Jiang Jun was able to surpass all the competitors and win the first prize. He now wishes to use his art to automatically contribute to the China Relief movement, which is extremely rare.

### Great Victory in Northern Henan: Shanghai People Excited

The Chinese army's counteroffensive in northern Henan was a great victory. The Japanese army suffered many casualties. Other battles in eastern Zhejiang and southern Hubei have also made progress in recent days. When the news came, the hearts of the people in Shanghai were extremely excited. Various groups in the city took this opportunity to mark the beginning of a new stage in the war. The front-line military has repeatedly won major victories, and the future of resistance and construction is booming. In excitement, they yesterday telegraphed the authorities to congratulate them on their victory.

### American "President Garfield" Ship Left Shanghai for New York Yesterday; Many British Nationals Will Leave Tomorrow on Dutch Ships; "Glengarry" Expected to Arrive in Port This Morning Carrying Foreign Rice

The American President Lines mail ship "President Garfield" left port yesterday (the 1st) morning, heading to Singapore, South Africa, and Darrinida, among other places, to return to New York in the United States. A total of 38 passengers boarded the ship from Shanghai, including Mr. Hall Patch of the British Embassy, and Mr. McCassey and Taylor of the American President Lines. Mr. McCassey and Taylor will disembark in Manila. When the "President Garfield" arrived in Shanghai last Saturday, the passengers who landed included Mr. Adams, President of the Chinese Business Corporation who returned to Shanghai from the United States, and Mr. Haiginson, General Manager of Haigining Foreign Firm.

Many British Nationals Evacuated from Shanghai

The Dutch Java Transport Company's "Chisadani" ship has been in port for five days since it arrived last week. It is now learned that the ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow (the 3rd), passing through Xiamen and Hong Kong, to the Dutch East Indies Java and Batavia. It is rumored that the first and second class cabins of the ship have been fully occupied by foreigners, with British nationals being the most numerous, reaching more than 30 people. They will transfer to other ships in the Dutch East Indies to go to Australia or South Africa. Only a dozen Dutch nationals from this port will take the ship back to their country. As for the company's "Chisaruya" ship, it will arrive in Shanghai from the Dutch East Indies in the middle of this month.

Validity Period of the Dutch Ship's Epidemic Certificate

Furthermore, the company notified passengers that the effective date of the vaccination certificate is (1) five days before arriving in Xiamen for those going to Xiamen, (2) forty days before arriving in Hong Kong, Little Luzon, and Java, (3) and the certificate must be issued by the Public Works Bureau's health office.

Large Quantities of Food Transported to the Philippines

According to the French Shipping Company, the company's Oting ship is scheduled to leave port this morning, and the Dada Nan ship is scheduled to leave port on the 4th of this month. Both ships will pass through Manila after traveling through a bay. It is rumored that the cargo carried by the two ships to be unloaded in Manila will be large quantities of potatoes and onions, while the cargo unloaded in Saigon will be large quantities of cloth. As for the company's Losi ship, it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Vietnam tomorrow (the 3rd).

American "Glengarry" Ship Arrives in Shanghai Carrying Rice

The local Chinese ship company's Glengarry ship will arrive in Shanghai this morning from Yangon via Singapore and is scheduled to dock at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong. This ship will carry 30,000 bags of foreign rice. Yesterday morning, the Philippine cargo ship Florence also arrived in Shanghai, carrying a large quantity of lumber.

### This Year's Rainfall is Higher Than Last Year's

Higher Than Last Year's According to the Shanghai River Conservancy Bureau, the rainfall in Shanghai from January to August this year is as follows: January 2.68 inches, February 3.79 inches, March 2.26 inches, April 2.15 inches, May 4.06 inches, June 10.08 inches, July 9.25 inches, August 9.66 inches. Compared with the same period last year, this year's rainfall is almost double that of last year.

### Chinese Industrial Cooperatives Achieve Remarkable Results: Using US$1,000 to Engage in Mass Production

New York News: According to a report from the All-America China Relief Association, the China Industrial Cooperatives Committee in the United States, a member of the association's organization, received US$1,000 donated by the China Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association in Washington, D.C., in January of this year. After receiving the money, the association established an embroidery industrial cooperative in Meixian, Guangdong, which employed 100 refugee women. The embroidered products are sold all over the United States. It has only been a short time, and the profits and wages have been able to provide for the living expenses of the 100 female workers and their families, and a portion of the profits can be allocated on a regular basis to repay the principal amount, so that this capital can be used to set up other industrial cooperatives elsewhere in the future, expand the movement, and relieve refugees.

### Australian Trade Commissioner in Shanghai Suspended Operations Yesterday: Commissioner Bouton Transferred to Singapore; Restarting When Conditions Permit

Australian Trade Commissioner in Shanghai Bouton told reporters yesterday that the announcement published in the newspaper today that the Australian Trade Commissioner in Shanghai has suspended operations is due to restrictions on trade between British self-governing territories and the Far East. But he continued that it was the intention of the Australian government to reopen after the end of the war or when conditions permitted. It is understood that Mr. Bouton will be transferred to Singapore to take up the post of Australian Trade Representative. The original function of the Australian Trade Commissioner in Shanghai was to assist in the development of Australia's export trade, but since the outbreak of the war, most of Australia's exports have been dedicated to the needs of the British Empire and Australia itself, making it impossible to supply goods needed by China. In addition, the implementation of various economic restriction laws has made the development of trade almost impossible. Under these circumstances, the Australian Department of Industry and Commerce believes that the post of Trade Commissioner in Shanghai is equivalent to a virtual one, so it is better to abolish it.

### No Need to Worry About Gasoline Shortages

30,000 Gallons Consumed Daily: All Cash Transactions Starting Yesterday

Gasoline merchants in the local market have decided to suspend all credit transactions from yesterday due to the unstable foreign exchange market here. According to the staff of major gasoline companies in the local market, this cash transaction method is purely because gasoline merchants are unwilling to extend credit. The rumor that there is a shortage of gasoline here is completely unfounded. According to gasoline merchants, the 30,000 gallons of gasoline consumed daily in this market are usually sold on credit for a period of 45 days, so the accounts receivable from gasoline merchants here are as high as ten million yuan. It is said that gasoline merchants have not yet been able to obtain the foreign exchange stipulated by the Equalization Fund Committee. It is said that if they can obtain the foreign exchange of five yuan and three dimes and one and two tenths cents per US dollar, and the water feet continue as they are now, the price of gasoline can be greatly reduced. It is also said that the number of oil ships coming to Shanghai from the United States has been greatly reduced, but they are still continuing to arrive, so there is no fear of a gasoline interruption in this market.

### Merchants Can Use Insured Envelopes to Pay Fees and Collect Slips

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's office in Hong Kong notified various industries in the city that Shanghai merchants can exchange for Hong Kong character certificates, and the visa system has always been mailed separately. Application letters for Hong Kong character certificates sent from Shanghai are divided into two steps. After a few days, a paper English note filled out by the Hong Kong post office is received, stating that Hong Kong dollars are received from someone in Shanghai, and the recipient must affix a seal and report the name of the remitter to the post office before he can claim it. This method is completely different from the domestic post office's method of claiming money based on the remitter's letter, and it is very troublesome to grope in the dark. There are often cases where the amounts of remittances are the same, resulting in misidentification. Checking the post office's insured envelope, you can attach banknotes. In the future, Shanghai slips should be sent to Hong Kong, and the fee (including the return postage of 33 cents in Hong Kong dollars) should be exchanged for Hong Kong dollars and sealed in the letter together with the slip, which is much more convenient than the current method.

### The Labor Dispute at Two Wharves: Both Sides' Opinions Are Approaching

The workers at the Gonghexian and Shuntai wharves have been deadlocked for more than ten days since they demanded a wage increase and a bloody tragedy occurred. The local wharf workers' union believed that the long-term stalemate of the labor dispute was not good for society and had made its best efforts to mediate. It has approached a well-known businessman and the person in charge of the union, and their opinions are quite close, and there is hope for a peaceful resolution.

### Rotary Club's Weekly Meeting This Week

The Shanghai Rotary Club's weekly meeting this week will be a closed meeting, scheduled for noon on September 4th, still held at the Horse Racing Association at 304 Maho Road. At that time, a ceremony will be held to introduce new members to the club, and club affairs will be discussed. Fellow members from other cities are welcome to attend. If fellow members from this city are unable to attend the meeting, they are asked to notify the club secretary before Wednesday afternoon.

### There is Absolutely No Reason for a Shortage of Auxiliary Currency Coupons in the Shanghai Market: Citizens Please Do Not Scare Each Other; The Four Banks Continue to Issue and Adjust

In order to adjust the one-yuan coupons and auxiliary currency in the Shanghai market, the four banks of Zhongzhong Jiaonong commissioned friendly banks to transport one-dime, two-dime auxiliary currency coupons and one-yuan coupons from Hong Kong to the Central, China, and Zhongnong banks. In addition, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank issued one-fen and five-fen fractional currency coupons, and the Bankers Association issued one-fen and five-fen aluminum coins to circulate as much as possible in the market, so that the auxiliary currency shortage panic could be resolved. Recently, since last week, there have been rumors in the market that someone has raised prices to buy aluminum coins, which has caused another auxiliary currency shortage panic. The reporter of the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the Central Bank and the Bankers Association yesterday that the number of auxiliary currency coupons and aluminum fractional currency coupons issued in the Shanghai market is quite large, with a total of 15 million yuan in aluminum coins, a total of 6 million yuan in fractional currency coupons, and more than 10 million yuan in one-dime and two-dime auxiliary currency coupons. Although some damaged auxiliary currency coupons and fractional currency coupons have been withdrawn, it is determined that there will be no shortage panic in terms of the legitimate need for circulation in the market. The Central Bank and the Bankers Association have now continued to issue and exchange as much fractional currency coupons and aluminum coins as possible from their inventories, but only normal needs in various industries can apply for exchange, and it is hoped that citizens will not hoard them, or scare each other, in order to avoid being fooled by villains.

### Tai Depang's Embezzlement of Public Property - Previously Committed Theft and Escaped from Prison - Previously Committed a Major Case in New York - The U.S. Consulate General Will File an Additional Charge

The Shanghai Times reports that in the case of Tai Depang, the former deputy executive officer of the U.S. Consulate General in China, embezzling and selling government-owned pistols and bullets worth US$210, fingerprint records may be of great importance when the trial opens soon. It turns out that the authorities had previously telegraphed Tai's fingerprints to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation using a code. They have now received a telegram from the Bureau stating that the defendant's fingerprints are the same as those of a person who

committed a major theft case

in New York in 1929. The thief escaped from American justice in 1932 after the trial was finalized and became a fugitive. It is reported that Jack LaLanne, the "slot machine" king in Shanghai, was arrested for operating gambling. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department telegraphed his fingerprints to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, which confirmed that they matched the fingerprints of a criminal who

escaped from prison

in Oklahoma, USA. After further investigation of Jack LaLanne's past history, he was sent back to the United States for imprisonment. According to the English-language "China Press", the U.S. Attorney for China, Shields, will file a new indictment against former Executive Officer Tai Depang tomorrow (the 2nd). The details of the new indictment are still unknown this morning, as today is Labor Day and the U.S. Court for China is closed as usual. It is expected that when Shields files the new indictment against Tai Depang tomorrow, there will be

startling revelations.

According to sources, the Washington Federal Bureau of Investigation has sent a telegram to Shanghai stating that Tai Depang's fingerprints match those of a person who committed theft in New York in 1929 and escaped in 1932. Tai Depang is currently being held in the Ward Road Prison and will be formally tried by the specially appointed magistrate晏登 in the next few days. During the previous preliminary hearing, Tai Depang stated to the court that he could not afford to hire a defense lawyer, so Magistrate晏登 specially appointed Cabus, an assistant lawyer of American lawyer A. Loleman, to defend him during the formal trial.

### The Da Shun Kang Steamer - Decided to Depart Tomorrow

The Da Shun Kang steamer of the French-owned Likang Shipping Company, which will directly travel to Chihkan in Guangzhou Bay for the first time, did not depart today due to insufficient loading. It was originally scheduled to set sail today, but due to the rainy weather, it was difficult to load the goods, so it was decided to postpone it for another day and set sail tomorrow. The ship is currently docked at buoy number 20 in Yangshupu. Passengers can board the ship via the small fireboat at the Xinguang Wharf tomorrow morning. At present, the number of passengers taking the ship is quite crowded, reaching more than one hundred people.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council - Denies the Cleansing Guild

The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently issued a notice stating that any organization calling itself the "Cleansing Industry Professional Guild" is not a formally recognized organization by the Council. Any collection of fees or other rewards from households in the name of this organization has not been approved by the Council.

### Biography of Mr. Wang Dankui (1) - Tang Weizhi

In the early Qing Dynasty, Jiangsu Province set up Taicang Directly Subordinate Prefecture, which belonged to four counties, namely Zhenyang, Jiading, Shishan, and Chongming. Chongming is located on the coast, and the pure and auspicious energy of heaven and earth spreads widely, accumulating for more than two hundred years, giving birth to a great Confucian scholar of long-standing virtue named Mr. Wang Dankui. When Mr. Wang was born, people looked up to him, thinking that he was the hope for rain for the common people. Unfortunately, Zhu died before his project could be fully implemented. When he passed away, his hometown was shocked and grieved, weeping and telling each other. They asked me to write a biography, saying that I was the only one who knew Mr. Wang in this vast world, and asked me not to refuse. I said that the biography of Mr. Wang is not just a biography of one family or one village. It should be included in the national history and passed down to future generations. However, Mr. Wang and I were honored to be close friends, and it is appropriate to shed light on his hidden virtues, waiting for those who come later.

Mr. Wang's given name was Qingmu, Dankui was his courtesy name, and in his later years, his alias was Nongyin. His ancestors, during the mid-Qianlong period, had a Duke Du, who was the commander of the right camp of the Song and Song Garrison. His great-grandfather, Duke Hanming, followed the official to Chongming, and then occupied the Chongming nationality. After five generations, Mr. Wang's father, named Cheng, with the courtesy name Baoqing, and his mother, Madam Zhang, gave birth to Mr. Wang in September of the tenth year of Xianfeng. He had extraordinary talents since childhood, was upright, intelligent, and respected by the elders. As he grew older, he became more dignified. When he served Mr. Baoqing, he listened respectfully with a proper expression, and remained silent without speaking lightly. When he made friends, he was gentle and refined, respectful and courteous. If someone made a mistake, he would advise them. When he read books, he understood them silently in his heart, explored the meaning thoroughly, and combined theory with practice. At a young age, he became a doctoral student. In the year of Wuzi, he passed the local imperial examination. In the year of Jichou, he took the Ming test and failed. Then he stayed in the capital. In the year of Gengyin, he became a Jinshi and was assigned to the Ministry of Household. Then he studied the practical and useful learning of economics. He stayed in the Beijing Banner Nationality Song family. His master was originally Song Du San, with the courtesy name Shen, who once served as the chief examiner of the Bingxu Department. After his death, the family gradually declined. His brother Chonghou, who signed the Treaty of Livadia with Russia and lost land, was impeached by the censor. He bullied his orphaned nephew and wanted to seize his family property. Mr. Wang and Feng Jun Menghua, who were on the same list as him in the Bingxu Department, went to see Chonghou. Chong said, "This is my family matter, and you elder brothers do not need to interfere." Mr. Wang said, "No, if your family affairs can be handled by yourself, we would not dare to interfere. Now that you cannot handle it yourself, we, who are related to your family, have to come out and interfere." Feng Jun helped him, and his words were very stern. Chong had no choice but to divide the property and listen to public opinion. When Mr. Wang returned to the museum, Chong's son had already destroyed the books in the chamber and abandoned the idols on the ground. Mr. Wang was furious and said, "If you dare to come again, I will send you to the authorities." Chong's son was afraid and disappeared. Mr. Xu Jihe of Jiading heard of this and praised him highly, saying, "Mr. Wang defends the orphan with righteousness and chivalry. He is a talented man from our hometown." Then the dukes and ministers heard of it and competed to know Mr. Wang.

At that time, although the court was peaceful, foreign insults were increasing, and it had become a state of accumulated weakness. In the Jiawu War, land was ceded and indemnities were paid. Mr. Wang was filled with sorrow and anger, and then he studied diplomacy diligently. In the year of Bingshen, he passed the examination for the General Affairs Office of the various countries and became an associate editor of the Hall of Documents. In the year of Wuxu, he was appointed as a director. In the autumn of that year, Imperial Envoy Pu Liang went to Shandong to investigate the case, and Mr. Wang was ordered to follow him. He returned to the capital the following year, and his reputation for integrity became more prominent. When the Complete Book of Documents was completed, he was promoted to the fifth rank. In the winter of that year, the Boxer Rebellion spread in the capital. In the summer of the year of Gengzi, they killed missionaries and invaded the capital. Mr. Wang and I secretly discussed that the situation was urgent and we should quickly find a place to avoid the disaster. We should not alarm the Emperor. Mr. Wang took his parents to Baodi to avoid the disaster, and I took my parents to Pingyifen Village to avoid the disaster. Then we each returned to Beijing to work, and the Allied Forces had already captured Tianjin. The whole court was shaken. At that time, Mr. Wang and I were both in charge of the Yunnan Department of the Ministry of Household, responsible for grain transport. We were ordered to distribute all the warehouses in Tongzhou. After the matter was completed, we were assigned to translate confidential telegrams in the inner court. Military documents flew about, and warnings were constantly spread day and night. Mr. Wang and I secretly discussed that the country's affairs were in disarray. We should stay and wait for the change. In the seventh month of that year, the Boxer Rebellion became more powerful, and the relatives of the emperor competed to agree, falsely ordering the killing of ministers Xu Jingcheng and Yuan Chang. Ten days later, the Allied Forces forced Tongzhou, and Li Bingheng went to war and died. On the 15th of that month, I went home to visit my parents and returned to Beijing. I saw the Boxers abandoning their red scarves and fleeing north, saying that the foreign soldiers had arrived and the two palaces had gone west. I had no choice but to turn back. Looking at the city of Beijing at night, the fire was raging. I thought about Mr. Wang even more. Heaven was tired of the chaos and created the universe again. The court ordered Prince Qing Yikuang to stay in Beijing to negotiate peace. After a month, the news spread to the countryside. I went to the capital alone and stayed in the Shao family in the East City. After a few days, Mr. Wang arrived and told me about his adventure to Baodi. He said that he had survived a second life. We met with great sorrow and joy. At that time, the various offices were destroyed, and the Ministry of Household was especially messy. We set up a separate office to clear the case.

In the autumn of the year of Xinchou, I followed the mission to Dongying. In April of the year of Renyin, I followed the mission to England. Mr. Wang was in charge of the Yunnan Department of the Ministry of Household alone, and also took charge of the translation office. Later, the translation office was changed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and special officials were appointed. Mr. Wang was reassigned to the Drafting Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After the two palaces returned to the capital, they were determined to innovate. During the spring and summer of the year of Guimao, the 29th year, a special economic examination was opened to recruit talents from all over the world. Lu Bokui, a fellow countryman and chief justice, recommended Mr. Wang for the examination. I also joined the ranks and went to take the examination together, but we both failed. In the autumn of that year, the Ministry of Commerce was established. Prince Gusshan Zaiyu and Zhou Zhen were appointed as ministers. Before that, the Prime Minister's Office was changed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with one minister, two deputy ministers, and one left and right minister and councilor each. The Ministry of Commerce was arrogant about its system. At that time, I was serving as the right minister, and Minister Zai asked who could serve as a councilor. I recommended Mr. Wang. The minister was very happy to see Mr. Wang, and then promoted him from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the right councilor.

Our country's rise and fall for thousands of years has been based on Confucian virtues as the basis, while the Western countries have used commercial prosperity as the center. Mr. Wang said that if we want to connect commercial feelings, protect commercial interests, open commercial wisdom, and create commercial ethics, it will not be successful without setting up a chamber of commerce. Moreover, eliminating internal malpractices and investigating external affairs all depend on the chamber of commerce. Minister Zai praised his statement, and then commissioned Mr. Wang to be stationed in Shanghai to establish a chamber of commerce first, and decided to extend it to various provinces and foreign ports. The merchants were very happy. A certain overseas merchant met with Mr. Wang and suddenly cried. Mr. Wang was surprised and asked him why. He said with tears that he had met with the great officials and nobles before, but he could not see them once, nor could he see them twice. After seeing them three or four times, he could not express his feelings because of his arrogance. Now he could see Mr. Wang at once, who was humble and kind, so he felt extremely emotional and cried. Mr. Wang praised him and said that his sincerity was so moving. In the year of Bingwu, Mr. Wang entered the capital to report his achievements and was promoted to the right minister of the Ministry of Commerce. The Ministry of Commerce proposed to set up road affairs councilors to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of railways in various provinces. A certain powerful person in Beiyang was worried about this and planned to weaken the power of the Ministry of Commerce. Someone suggested that we should remove Wang first, so that the department would be abolished. So they recommended Mr. Wang as the inspector of Zhejiang, which was a demotion. At that time, Mr. Wang was sick. I went to his bedside, and we held hands and sobbed. Mr. Wang told me that my begging was over. Then he begged to return home to support his parents. In the winter of that year, Madam Tai passed away. I also left Beijing to attend the funeral of my mother. Comrades in mourning, crying and meeting each other, were exhausted and worried. The same experience was so sad. After the mourning period, the authorities knew that Mr. Wang was honest and upright, and they reappointed him to Zhejiang to supervise finance. When Mr. Wang arrived, he told the officials that the way of measuring in the university was to take righteousness as profit, not profit as profit. Profit is what people want together, but profit is the source of harm. If you are not careful, the harm will affect yourself. The responsibility of supervising is to first purify one's own integrity, and then promote the integrity of others. If there are more honest and upright officials, the wind of greed will be restrained, and the world will naturally be peaceful. He was willing to take Zhejiang as an example. From then on, the officials were moved by his words, and the wind was clear and the abuses were eliminated.

### The Ministry of Education Stipulates Key Points for Promoting Teacher Education in Various Provinces and Cities

Orders to Various Provinces and Cities to Re-Submit Plans for Review and Approval

(Chongqing Air Mail) The Ministry of Education, in accordance with the Executive Yuan's instruction to review and issue the resolutions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee on the education report, pointed out that "Teacher education is the mother of national education. Now that there are normal colleges and universities above the specialist level, in the future, we should try our best to restore the independent establishment system of normal schools in secondary education, and actively expand and cultivate a sufficient number of excellent teachers to meet the needs of promoting national education." It is reported that the Ministry has re-formulated four key points for promoting teacher education in various provinces and cities, ordering various provinces and cities to re-submit plans or programs for promoting teacher education for review and implementation. The key points are as follows: (1) Provinces that have normal schools attached to joint middle schools, or that have normal classes attached to middle schools, should be urged to establish them independently. (2) Provinces that have already designated normal school districts in accordance with the 1938 instructions on determining normal education programs, and most districts have already established one or two normal schools, should be urged to add women's normal schools in each district, or first set up women's normal departments in normal schools, and gradually make them independent, and urge the normal schools in each province and district to increase classes and enrich content year by year. (3) In accordance with the instructions on determining normal education programs, each county in the normal school district of each province should establish a simple normal school alone or jointly with several counties. It is now found that the simple normal schools that have been established in various provinces are not enough to promote the needs of national education. Provinces should order, in addition to the number of simple normal schools that have been established, to plan and prepare to set up several simple normal schools in the whole province, and submit a plan for annual promotion to the Ministry for approval and implementation. (4) During the implementation of national education, provinces should be urged to recruit as many simple normal special normal courses as possible in each normal school or simple normal school to meet the needs.

### The Ministry of Education Investigates County Education Administration

Formulates Forms and Orders Them to Be Reported for Verification

(Chongqing Air Mail) Whether the county education administrative agency is sound or not is closely related to the road to national education and is of great importance. In order to clearly understand the general situation of education administration in various counties and cities, the Ministry of Education has recently formulated two types of investigation forms, which are sent to various provinces and ordered to be reported by their subordinate agencies within a time limit for statistics and separate verification and instruction. Detailed investigations are conducted on administrative institutions, document processing, personnel management, inspection and guidance, financial management, investigation and statistics, meeting held, research and improvement, and the qualifications and treatment of administrative personnel.

### Hong Kong and Macau Relief Society: Aiding Students Out of School

(Hong Kong Correspondence) Last year, the Hong Kong and Macau Relief Society organized relief for young people out of school, offering free placements at various primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Recently, they suddenly received notices from various schools stating that the free arrangement was limited to one year, and that those wishing to continue their studies would have to pay fees according to regulations. As a result, hundreds of impoverished students were greatly distressed. It is now learned that after receiving notice of the schools' termination of the free arrangement, the Hong Kong and Macau Relief Society immediately began consultations with the schools, requesting that they continue to provide free or half-price preferential treatment as before. As a result, with the exception of two or three schools that were unable to comply due to excessive reductions in student places caused by the new Hong Kong education regulations, the majority accepted the Society's request, allowing impoverished students to continue their studies as usual. However, some students have been suspended by their schools due to poor exam results and conduct. It is reported that the Society is now in further consultations with other schools, requesting the allocation of a number of free places to assist these impoverished students. Several schools have agreed to consider the matter, while others are still deliberating. It is expected that there will be a sufficient number of places available for replacement. Depending on the quantity, priority will be given to those who have already received preferential treatment but have recently been suspended by their schools. If there are any remaining places, another public examination will be held to select outstanding students to enjoy this right. As the start of the school term is approaching, the Society's work is proceeding very actively. Once all allocations are completed, each student will be notified separately, so that these hundreds of distressed and helpless impoverished students can feel at ease and pursue their studies.

### National School Principals to Become Full-Time

Zhejiang Provincial Government Ordered to Comply

(Jinhua Correspondence) It has recently been ordered by the Executive Yuan that, in accordance with the National Political Council's recommendation regarding the principals of central and national schools, they should be made full-time positions as far as possible. The Ministry of Education has decided to adopt and implement this proposal and ordered immediate compliance. After receiving the order, the Provincial Government has issued instructions to all counties to strictly comply.

### Student Economic Relief Society: Distributing Subsidies

Sent to Schools to Notify Students to Collect

The economic aid for impoverished students, organized by the Shanghai Student Economic Relief Society, has been officially approved for this year. A total of 150 university and middle school students have been approved for assistance, including 100 university students and 50 middle school students. Notification letters of admission were also issued individually long ago. According to information learned by a Shenjiang News reporter, the Society, recognizing that schools have successively begun their terms, has also decided to issue the subsidies within days. As for the distribution method, the Society, in order to help promote the relationship between students and schools and to avoid accidents during collection, has specifically decided to send the subsidies to the schools where the students are studying, so that the schools can notify the students to prepare receipts and collect and submit them to the school authorities. It is also learned that the subsidies will be distributed as soon as possible within the next five days of this month.

### Snail

— Xiao Yun

—I Learned a Lesson

It was the summer of seven years ago. A group at school was going to visit an insane asylum, and I signed up out of curiosity.

We, about twenty students, were led by an old foreign professor who was quite knowledgeable in abnormal psychology. We boarded a van and set off for our destination.

The insane asylum was run by the Catholic Church, and the old facade adorned with ivy told us of its long history. A French priest in a long black robe with a brown beard hanging from his chin greeted us with a smile. At the end of the green lawn, through a small white door that could only fit one person, was the insane asylum we were to visit.

On both sides were long rows of low houses, separated by courtyards paved with gravel, about eight or nine feet wide. The madmen lived in small rooms on both sides, each about six or seven feet square. The light in the rooms was dim, and the walls were covered with cotton, covered with canvas. In some places, the canvas was torn, and the cotton wadding was exposed. There were no windows in the room, only a door in the front, closed with iron bars, looking like a prison. In the room, besides a pile of dry straw, there was nothing else. In this gloomy and small room, there were of course no sanitary facilities. The madmen slept on the straw with their clothes on.

With curious and fearful hearts, we looked through the first small house. Most of the rooms were occupied by only one person, but some were crowded with three or four people. When the madmen saw us passing by, some ran to the iron bars and stared at us, some were nonchalant and expressionless, some were immersed in the illusions of fantasy, some were giggling foolishly, some were singing Peking opera, and some were performing martial arts. In short, everyone had their own expression.

The French priest opened a door and let us in. A middle-aged man in a long black gown was sleeping on the straw pile, his beard had not been shaved for a long time, and he was lying there reading ancient books. The priest told us that this man was originally a businessman who had studied in Germany, but became ill due to business failures and bankruptcy, and spent his days reciting ancient Chinese books. Behind the iron bars of another room, a young man in a suit and shirt stood there blankly, smiling in a daze, as if he did not see us. The French priest told us that this young man was originally a student at a certain university, excellent in character and studies, but went mad due to the trauma of frustration. We left those mentally ill patients with full of thoughts and deep impressions.

When we came out, we passed through a garden. The old professor who led us to visit suddenly stopped, squatted down, and waved to us. Everyone felt a little strange and gathered around.

The old professor pointed to a snail crawling on the ground and said: "Everyone may not take this tiny animal seriously, but I tell you, this snail is a little stronger than the mentally ill patients we just saw. Like the madmen, when they encounter difficulties on the journey of life, they shrink into their shells and escape into the unreal world. But the snail is stronger than the madman. When the danger has passed, they put their heads out again and continue to walk the road of life. But once a madman escapes into the unreal world, he dares not put his head out again. He would rather, forever hide in the unreal shell.

"Mental illness seems complicated, but it is actually very simple." The professor continued to say earnestly, "The attitude of escaping from real life is the cause of all mental illnesses. A healthy life is to face reality and not be afraid of difficulties."

From that snail and the old professor's words, I gained a new attitude towards life. I learned a lesson that I will never forget.

### Eye Exchange Service

— Lan Tie

Recently, many people in Northern California who are willing to sacrifice their eyes after death to treat the blind have formed a novel group called the Dawn Society. Because doctors have been able to graft the cornea of one eye onto another eye in recent years. But this operation often cannot be performed due to the lack of healthy fibrous tissue. People who are willing to donate their eyes to the blind after death often cannot fulfill their promises. Because their relatives rarely agree to doctors performing eye removal surgery on the deceased when a generous sacrificer dies.

The eyes must be removed within six hours after death and stored cold in a salt-containing solution, which can preserve them for up to two weeks. Although the urgent need often prevents them from being stored for more than a few hours to several days.

Blind people who wish to undergo "restoration surgery" can register with a nearby doctor. The Dawn Society lists their names in order of receipt of applications and decides to serve them. These "gift eyes" are also often sent to other cities to blind people elsewhere.

Vision is one of the most important senses of mankind and is related to everything in life. It not only gives people a feeling of comfort or relief, but it is also the main tool for the development of human intellect. Trying to restore the vision of the blind is indeed a responsibility that we sighted people should take on. According to the above record, this seems to have been successful. However, I saw another report in the same book that the eyes of mammals cannot be transplanted, nor can those of fish. We still have to keep working hard. Professor L. S. Stone of Yale University Medical School has successfully experimented with salamanders. According to his report, transplanted salamander eyes usually grow well, although the recovery of vision is still a very circuitous process. Because the severed visual nerve endings do not connect, it is necessary to wait for the retina and nerves to regrow. It takes up to two months for complete growth, at which time vision can be restored.

Invention

### Small Parachute Ke Zhong

The "Flying General Descending from Heaven" in ancient supernatural novels has now been realized in paratroopers. The parachutes used by ordinary paratroopers are quite bulky because they are designed to prevent too rapid a descent. Recently, the American inventor Dr. Muffy has found a way to improve this, making the parachute smaller than ordinary parachutes. A silk inverted cone is added to increase the speed of air flowing into the parachute while reducing the rate of descent. This improved parachute is lighter and is expected to be adopted by armies of various countries soon. The picture shows Dr. Muffy testing his newly made small parachute.

Twelve Unexpected Storms

In a girls' school in a remote county like this in North China, there is still a bit of a nunnery-like atmosphere, so the task of checking students' mail has become a major event that Warden Wang must carefully attend to every day.

"Ju Fang sent... such a trick can't hide from me!" In the half-year she began to perform this task, "Yueying", "Lihua", "Guizhen", "Suqiu"... the appearance of such purely feminine names on the envelopes did confuse Warden Wang, but slowly she finally saw through it. From then on, as long as she saw that the sender used such a name, she would definitely open the letter. However, there were also many cases where opening it proved that it was not a love letter. This letter "Ju Fang sent" was sent by a real cousin of a female student.

So our Warden Wang frowned disappointedly, glued the envelope casually, and stamped a seal on the opening.

Immediately afterwards, she examined three letters and a postcard, all of which were so ordinary that they absolutely did not attract her attention. Later, she picked up the sixth letter, glanced at it quickly and put it aside, until she was about to look at the seventh letter that she remembered something.

"Ah! That's not right! Wu Meiying has been back for two weeks, why hasn't she received a letter from home yet!" She thought in surprise.

Warden Wang picked up that letter again and looked at it carefully. The words on it were clearly her father's handwriting! And the date of dispatch was only two days ago. This was really a big mystery. (200)

To Friends Who Are Applying to the Drama Training Class

Two months ago, I saw an advertisement in various newspapers for a drama training class organized by a certain theater company, which coincided with my love of drama. I wanted to take advantage of my spare time to explore more knowledge about drama, and because the school was very close to my home, I went to apply for the exam.

When I went to register, they had been in session for a week, so I was exempted from the entrance exam. I was given a class card and went to the lecture hall to listen to the lectures after paying the tuition fee, miscellaneous fee, and badge fee.

Of the dozens of teachers mentioned in the advertisement, few could come to the school to teach. Sometimes they would ask for leave because of their own affairs, so there would always be one or two days a week when we went to school and then immediately went home.

After being sick for two weeks, I went back to school to listen to the lectures at the beginning of the second month's course, but there were no teachers to teach us anymore. Every day, several one-act plays were being rehearsed. The few students who took on the roles were reciting their lines in impure Mandarin. No one was correcting the pronunciation of that accented Mandarin, and no one was guiding the articulation. Many students who did not have roles, like me, wandered around the school every day, listening to that strange-sounding Mandarin. Or they just sat blankly at their desks. A few who were more active would joke with their classmates, "You're her dad, she's his daughter, he's her husband, she's your mom..." and it would become a mess.

The authorities announced that they would stage the rehearsed plays at the end of the third month's course as our graduation ceremony, and at the same time hold (a make-up) opening ceremony? Now that the second month's course is over, the directors of the prepared one-act plays have not yet been found. Where do we even begin?

Two months have passed. I ask myself, what have I gained? Nothing at all. I haven't even received the badge that I paid for. I don't have the courage to go back to school to be trained. What is the result of the training? The active young people who originally filled a classroom have gradually dispersed. Only the few students who took on roles, hoping to perform in the third month, are still rehearsing their lines.

I have written down and published my experience of joining the training class for two months. My only hope is that the teachers who run the drama training class will take responsibility and promote the drama movement properly. Don't be dominated by the current environment, becoming business-like, always focused on making money, and deceiving this active group of us.

### Questioning "White Gate Tower"

— Ming Kang

"White Gate Tower" focuses on singing, divided into three types: slow, medium, and fast tempos. Amateur opera singers who study young male roles mostly start with this opera, but it is often taught by female role performers, lacking a proper lineage. In fact, singing the "baby tune" for young male roles is as strenuous as singing the "anti-erhuang" for older male roles. The pitch cannot be too high or too low. Too high, and there is a danger of "becoming unsustainable"; too low, and there is the problem of "incoherent phrasing." Every word requires strength, and there is no room for carelessness. Currently, there is a scarcity of talented young male role performers, and many specialize in "fan opera." Therefore, this opera is rarely seen except when Ye ShengLan and Zhou WeiJun come south for occasional performances. ShengLan's singing, acting, and expressions are naturally beyond words. WeiJun, on the other hand, excels in both appearance and voice, achieving the perfect balance. What sets him apart is his portrayal, such as the smile he shares with Diao Chan before appearing on stage in the first act of the drunken scene, and the drunken state he portrays while reciting "attacking the lamp moth," which are all very convincing. As for female performers playing male roles, although there are such performances, their movements are often contrived and their voices are indistinguishable between male and female, greatly diminishing the heroic spirit of Wen Hou, which is not worth mentioning.

### Miscellaneous Notes on Theater Arts

— Fen Yu

Since the owner of the Xin Ji Great Stage, Fan HengDe, was assassinated, there have been various rumors about the overall situation of the stage. According to the reporter's investigation, the current situation remains unchanged, with Fan HengLiang and Fan HengCheng jointly managing everything.

The new golden talent, Zhang WenJuan, hosted a banquet for the theater press last night, preparing to publish a special issue.

Ji YuLiang is scheduled to return to Beiping by train on the 9th with his colleagues and stage crew. His trip to Shanghai this time can be considered a decent success.

The updated new opera, Six Books of New Journey to the West, began rehearsals last night after the performance, with new talents Wang LanFang and Li XinFu joining.

Tian Chan's Chen HongSheng and Chen GuiLan are preparing to rehearse the complete Emperor Liang Wu.

Zhou XinFang's performance schedule is of great concern to his fans, but when reporters inquire about it, he always smiles and says: "I still need a considerable period of rest."

### Kaleidoscope of the Film World

— Xing

In the film "Home," there is a scene of a private opera performance. Originally, they planned to film a segment of "Yu Tang Chun" while Xun HuiSheng was in Shanghai, but it did not materialize. It is said that Zhang ShanKun has instructed the manager of Gong Wu Stage, Zhou JianXing, to contact Yu SuLian, as he believes that Yu SuLian is well-suited for the "camera face" standard.

Since her divorce, Zhou Xuan has rarely socialized. Recently, she accompanied Zhou ManHua to watch Ma ZhangHua's "De Du Ban" Yue Opera, and her face has become slightly fuller.

Li LiHua also intends to make a film at her own expense. Although she does not have a large amount of capital herself, she has the help of relatives and friends, so she has a great desire to proceed. However, due to contractual relationships with the company, it may be difficult to fulfill her wishes for the time being.

Tang Jie returned to Shanghai after performing in North China. He has contacted Guolian several times. Yesterday, when Tang Jie was asked about the situation, he replied: "I won't talk about Shanghai for the time being. I'm going to Hong Kong, and then I'll talk about Shanghai matters when I come back."

### Small Biography of Ma YanFen

— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master

The famous Kun Opera dan performer, Ma YanFen, is the niece of the veteran actor, Zi JinXian, and also the younger sister of the Ma sisters (YanQiu and YanYun), who were famous in the former capital. YanFen's art is mostly derived from her maternal uncle, Mr. Liu (ZhenTing, also known as Zi JinXian), and she also benefited greatly from the influence of her elder sister, YanYun. In the 27th year of the Republic [1938], she came south with the famous martial artist, Li WanChun, and performed at the Golden Theater as a second-tier performer. Her performances are known for their solid and skillful style. Her depth of knowledge is greater than that of many top Kun dan performers who only have empty reputations. This time, she is determined to travel south again with Zhang WenJuan. If they are well-matched, they will definitely complement each other like flowers and leaves. When she takes the stage, I will watch her with new eyes.

Chapter Fifteen: Where Does the Powerful Family Force Her Return?

Tian HongYu forced a smile and said, "YuanYuan, you are a clever girl, why worry about not knowing etiquette? After entering the palace, you will surely please the dragon's heart. But please remember the good intentions of my daughter.

In the future, if you are favored and wield power, living securely in the Zhaoyang Palace, do not disappoint my foolish father and daughter." YuanYuan said, "This little girl will never forget your kindness, rest assured, sir. For matters inside and outside the palace, please do not hesitate to guide me." Tian HongYu nodded, "Very good, from now on we are still like one family, not betraying each other. Prepare your poems well, tomorrow morning I will send you to the palace." After saying this, Tian HongYu stood up and sighed very subtly. He walked downstairs. At this moment, Chen YuanYuan's heart was like a pulley, sometimes worried, sometimes happy, sometimes doubtful, as if in a dream. She sat there foolishly, lost in endless thoughts. In the evening, maids came to serve her with incense and bathing, and all her clothes inside and out were changed. She didn't sleep at all that night, thinking back and forth. Early the next morning, she got up, washed her face, and put on makeup in front of the mirror. Tian HongYu quietly walked upstairs and stood aside watching her comb her hair. Today, Tian HongYu's expression changed to solemn when he saw YuanYuan, because after YuanYuan entered the palace, if she gained the emperor's favor, she would become a noble concubine, inviolable. He watched YuanYuan carefully put on makeup, adding flowers to brocade, making her even more beautiful. He really couldn't bear to let her go, feeling a little sad. But since things had come to this point, there was nothing he could do. He didn't say much to YuanYuan. When YuanYuan finished combing her phoenix bun and put on her golden hairpins, he went downstairs. YuanYuan finished her makeup, had a light breakfast, and changed into the scented clothes. Tian HongYu had already come to urge her to get in the carriage. Fortunately, everything would be provided in the palace, so she didn't need to bring anything. YuanYuan knew that she couldn't refuse this, she would have to go sooner or later. She didn't know what the emperor would look like when he saw her. She had to bite the bullet and walk slowly down the red stairs. Today, she was dressed even more gracefully, like a fairy. Everyone in the Tian family stood quietly on the side to watch, all marveling at her beauty. Tian HongYu accompanied YuanYuan to the hall, watched her sit in the colored sedan, and rode his horse, leading several family members, to escort YuanYuan into the palace.
