### Chiang Kai-shek Guarantees at the National参政会 That He Will No Longer Use Military Force to Sanction the Communists; Hopes the Communists Will Immediately Accept Advice and Change Their Attitude; Seeks a Reasonable Resolution to the Kuomintang-Communist Issue in the National参政会

Chongqing – According to today's announcement, the Chinese Communist Party has presented political and military demands to the National参政会. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated that the Communist Party's demands are no different from those Japan presented to the Kuomintang before the Lugouqiao Incident. Chiang also stated, "If the Communist Party obeys orders and ceases attacking other troops, the government will deal with them leniently. If they continue to disobey orders, violate discipline, and hinder the war effort, the government, for the sake of national interest and to ensure final victory, has no choice but to restrain them. However, I can guarantee that in the future, military action will never again be used to sanction the Communist Party. If the Communist Party adheres to the Three Principles of the People, fulfills its promise of the 26th year (1937), abolishes the Chinese Soviet government, and abolishes the Red Army, then I will not hold them accountable for the past. If the government accepts the Communist Party's demands, can China still be considered a nation?" The Chairman stated that the Communist Party demands that the government not sanction rebel troops and requests the demarcation of special zones outside of Chongqing's jurisdiction to form separate political organizations. This is, in effect, seeking special privileges not afforded to other parties. To make such demands at this time is openly opposing the National Government and the National参政会. Accepting their political demands would be tantamount to seizing power before the enemy. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "I believe they did not fully understand the gravity of their demands when drafting them. The government cannot recognize a part of the National Revolutionary Army as the Communist Party's army, because China can only have one army. In the political sphere, there can only be one governing power. The democratic regime behind the Japanese lines demanded by the Communist Party can only be equated with 'Manchukuo' and the 'Nanjing regime.'" Since the 27th year (1938), the Eighteenth Group Army has acted freely, disregarding orders from superiors, with grave consequences, shaking the nation and undermining the war effort. The Communist Party's demands to cease challenges, withdraw the anti-Communist forces from Central China, and immediately cease hostile actions are all deceptive propaganda. We are now in the midst of a struggle, and the government cannot be said to have 'anti-Communist forces.'" The Chairman requested that the representatives of the参政会 earnestly implore Mao Zedong and other Communist Party representatives to fundamentally change the Chinese Communist Party's attitude and actions, and to seek a reasonable resolution to this issue within the National参政会. If the Communist Party accepts the advice of the National参政会, refrains from any actions that contradict the national policy of resistance and nation-building, and adheres to the promise of the 26th year, then the government will act in accordance with the proposals of the National参政会.

Chongqing - This morning, the full text of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech on the Communist Party issue at the National参政会, as well as the full text of the telegram from the Communist Party leaders to the National参政会, were announced here. Thus, the reasons for the current friction between the Central Government and the Communist Party, as well as the details of the negotiations between the two sides, were disclosed publicly for the first time. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech first criticized the Communist Party for attempting to establish its own armed forces and for attempting to seize national power by exploiting the current national crisis. He then stated that a major reason why the Chinese army has been slow to launch a counter-offensive against the Japanese army is the irregular activities of the Communist army. Finally, he expressed the hope that the Communist Party would fulfill its promises, obey military orders, and join the united front to resist Japanese aggression, so that victory could be achieved sooner. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's report briefly stated that the Eighteenth Group Army, since the 27th year of the Republic (1938), had disobeyed the Commander-in-Chief's orders, withdrawn to the right bank of the Yellow River, and occupied cities such as Suide (transliteration). The irregular activities of the Communist army caused disturbances in the rear and threatened the base areas of resistance and nation-building. As a result, in the past two years, the government had to fight on one hand and maintain a large army in the Northwest and South on the other to ensure the security of the rear base areas. This was one of the most painful aspects of resistance and nation-building. In other countries, when the country is invaded, the whole country works together to resist foreign aggression. In our country, we must not only deal with foreign enemies but also prepare to cope with the threats from the rear base areas. Now, we are not only strong enough to deal with foreign enemies but also strong enough to protect the safety of the rear. What is regrettable is that a large force that could have been deployed to the front must now be stationed in the rear. If the Communist army fulfills its promises and obeys the Commander-in-Chief's orders, then I believe that we can achieve a major victory in the near future, or at least restore the front lines before the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic. From now on, any army that disobeys the Commander-in-Chief's orders will be severely punished. I dare to guarantee to this council that if the Communist Party obeys orders and participates in the national resistance program, then the government will never again take military action against the Chinese Communist Party. (Reuters, 9th)

Chongqing - The National参政会 resolved today to urge the government to begin negotiations with Britain and the United States to transfer the funds deposited by the Chinese people in American banks to the Chinese government, and for the Chinese government to issue war bonds to these depositors. The National参政会 also urged the government to improve the management of the Burma Road. The council passed a total of eighty proposals, including one suggesting that civil and military officials should receive equal salaries. The closing ceremony of the council will be held tomorrow morning. (Associated Press, 9th)

### Chinese Aircraft Fly to Yichang and Bomb Japanese Troops Crossing the River, Causing Significant Losses to the Japanese

Chongqing - According to aviation sources, several Chinese aircraft flew to Yichang this morning for a large-scale bombing, inflicting significant damage on the Japanese troops crossing the river and their equipment. According to Japanese reports, the Japanese are now using Yichang as a base to expand outwards to disrupt the Chinese army's front lines. The Yichang airfield has more than 200 Japanese aircraft stationed there. (Havas World Telegraph, 9th)

### Chinese Troops in Western Guangdong Recapture Dianbai and Shuidong; Japanese Troops Retreat to Ships Due to Overwhelming Force

Chongqing - The Central News Agency reported today that Chinese reinforcements have arrived on the southwestern coast of Guangdong Province, where Japanese troops landed on Shangxing, and have recovered two important coastal towns, Dianbai and Shuidong. The Japanese troops fled, retreating to ships, leaving behind 200 bodies. Simultaneously, on another front, Japanese aircraft attacked Yidong, north of Yichang, where the Japanese troops are now beginning to consolidate their position. (Associated Press, 9th)

Guangzhou - The Japanese Army Information Bureau in South China announced that the Japanese troops occupying several locations on the 400-kilometer-long narrow strip of land on the southern coast of Guangdong Province suddenly withdrew today, March 3rd. The reason given was that the purpose of disrupting the Chongqing transportation bases in the area had been achieved. It was no longer necessary to station troops near Ronggen, Dingbai, Shuidong (all transliterations), Leizhou, Beihai, and various ports, so they have all been withdrawn. According to official announcements, the withdrawing Japanese troops are now concentrated in an undisclosed location, so that they can repeat these military actions when necessary. (Reuters, 9th)

### Chinese Troops in Eastern Anhui Recapture Guhe

Lihuang - On the 1st, Japanese troops mobilized over 10,000 soldiers, along with more than 40 artillery pieces, from the Jinpu and Huainan Railways, advancing towards China in multiple directions from Chuxian County, Quanjiao, Dingyuan, Guoxian, Hefei, and Tongyanghe. When the Chinese troops in eastern Anhui found advantageous terrain for attacking the Japanese, they launched counter-attacks in segments and utilized the terrain to encircle the Japanese. Unable to withstand the attacks, the Japanese retreated westward. On the 4th, the Chinese troops recaptured Guhe and are currently pursuing the Japanese. (Electric dispatch on the 9th)

Editorial

### How to Respond?

"Over the past four years, millions of soldiers have done their utmost to serve the country; however, today I still represent the soldiers of the entire nation in purchasing 10,000 yuan of legal tender bonds, 1,000 US dollar bonds, and 500 pounds sterling bonds; in addition to contributing my strength, I will also do my best to contribute to the country." This is what Chairman Chiang Kai-shek declared at the tea party of the wartime bond drive committee. "The method of paying money to postpone military service violates the principle of equality in military service and should be abolished." This was the resolution of the fifth meeting of the first session of the Second National 参政会. These two matters are unrelated, but their spirit originates from the same foundation and must elicit a strong response from every Chinese person. Although Shanghai's situation is special, it absolutely does not limit the highest degree of possible response.

There are many truisms and many ordinary principles that are often overlooked by those who hear and understand them. Whether in a family of a husband and wife, or a group of three or five people, or an enterprise relied upon by hundreds of thousands of people, or even a vast modern country, its constituent elements must each do their best and share the hardships in order to achieve success. Such words are indeed commonplace that everyone hears and principles that everyone understands; however, in reality, not everyone acts this way because they are commonplace, nor does their status as truisms mean they no longer need to be reminded. Perhaps they see the near and forget the far, or know the small and not the great, but in fact, near and far, small and great are all the same principle. When a talented man is matched with a lazy wife, or a diligent and thrifty woman marries a decadent husband, they frown, blame heaven and earth, and complain endlessly; this is a common family in society, recognized as a family's misfortune. But when men and women fail to fulfill their obligations as citizens, who knows the sorrow, who comes to complain, who has ever blamed them, who deeply feels that this is the country's misfortune? Yet we cannot simply think that they have forgotten the country. Just like China before our eyes, everyone deeply believes that the war effort will surely succeed, everyone imagines the joy after the success of the war effort, and everyone eagerly anticipates the early arrival of joy; the unity and enthusiasm of the people's hearts in caring for the country can be said to be unsurpassed; however, when examined using the standard of each doing their best and sharing the hardships, how many have fulfilled their national obligations in the great cause of the war effort? What percentage of people have never exerted their strength to serve the country? Such attitudes of sitting back and waiting for success, or even sitting back and enjoying the fruits of success, not only lengthen the distance to success but are also extremely unfair to those who exert their strength to serve the country, and especially to the millions of soldiers. The principle is too commonplace, and there should be no need for anyone to say more; their conscience will surely automatically condemn them.

During wartime, for a country to ask its citizens to contribute money if they have money and strength if they have strength is the most lenient of requests. Look at the countries of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in the European War, and even countries that are urgently strengthening their war preparations, which country's citizens did not contribute both money and strength? It is true that a large number of Chinese people have already contributed money and strength, but there are also many who have evaded their obligations and have contributed nothing from beginning to end; these situations are relatively better in the interior, but it is difficult to say in Shanghai. Because of this, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, representing the soldiers of the entire nation, declared that even after exerting strength, he is still willing to contribute money. The 参政会 resolved that those who should contribute strength should not be allowed to evade contributing strength by trying to contribute money instead. People in Shanghai, based on their conscience, cannot but feel ashamed and cannot but respond! Military service regulations have not been implemented in Shanghai, so we can only hope that good men will voluntarily go to the interior to serve. Taking a step back, although the 参政会 resolved to abolish the method of paying money to postpone military service, if eligible draftees in Shanghai cannot realistically serve in the interior and voluntarily pay money, this is the obligation of good men and a fair and reasonable remedy; and their open-minded generosity is truly worthy of praise. As for purchasing government bonds, it is a national obligation, but it is not a compulsory apportionment in nature; purchasing or not purchasing is a test of a person's national concept and sense of obligation. And this time, the government bonds are simultaneously issued in three currencies: legal tender, US dollars, and British pounds, which can be regarded as a special convenience offered to the people of Shanghai. Legal tender bonds have denominations of one yuan and five yuan, and they can buy ten thousand or eight thousand without limit. Everyone does their best to fulfill their obligations, and it is not only the wealthy who should purchase a lot. As for foreign currency bonds, purchases are calculated in foreign currency, and interest and principal will be paid in foreign currency in the future. And the defined scope of circulation is extremely broad; it can simply be said that foreign currency banknotes, deposit slips, and drafts may be subject to freezing restrictions in the future and may not be able to be moved, while holding foreign currency bonds offers many more avenues. In short, fulfilling national obligations and serving the country can be quickly pursued and is not restricted by time, and can be pursued anywhere and is not restricted by space. How to make the highest degree of response depends solely on one's great ambition!

### U.S. Senate Debate Spans a Month, Lend-Lease Act Finally Passes, Roosevelt to Sign it into Law Soon, Large Quantities of Army War Materiel to be Shipped Out

Washington - According to a reliable source, President Roosevelt will sign the Lend-Lease Act tomorrow. Last night, the Senate, with a vote of 60 to 31, defeated the opposition and passed the Lend-Lease Act. (Reuters, 9th)

Miami - U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that President Roosevelt informed him by telephone that he will sign the Lend-Lease Act on Wednesday. (United Press, 9th)

Washington - After heated debate, the Lend-Lease Act was passed by the Senate last night with an absolute majority. American assistance to Britain in terms of military supplies and food is now guaranteed. The bill was introduced two months ago and passed by the House of Representatives a month ago. (Reuters, 9th)

Washington - The Lend-Lease Act, which took exactly two months from proposal to passage, has now been sent back to the House of Representatives for review. The main provisions of the bill remain unchanged, but the following restrictions have been added: (1) The detailed disposal of U.S. military supplies should be discussed with the Army Chief of Staff and the Chief of Naval Operations in advance. (2) The value of U.S. defense articles disposed of shall not exceed US$1,300,000,000, with the value of each item determined by the head of the department in charge. (3) The terms of disposal may be determined by the President, and such terms may include payment in kind of similar or other property, or any other direct or indirect benefit that the President deems appropriate. (4) The President's authority to implement this act will expire on June 30, 1943, but Congress may terminate it at any time by a majority vote if it deems it necessary. (5) Articles transferred to one country may not be transferred to another. (6) The President shall report to Congress at least every 90 days during the period of execution of this act. (7) Congress shall appropriate funds for the procurement of all new types of articles to supply foreign governments. (8) U.S. naval vessels shall not be used to escort ships in the combat zones. (9) Existing U.S. laws regarding the use and disposal of U.S. military forces shall not be changed. When the bill was introduced in both houses on January 10, it also contained a provision stipulating that British warships could be repaired and outfitted in U.S. shipyards. In addition, there was a clause stipulating that all provisions of this act could be implemented regardless of the provisions of other laws. Authorities believe that the latter provision will override the Neutrality Act and the Johnson Act, as it would allow for the lending and leasing of munitions, the exchange of defense information, and the equipping and supplying of belligerent ships in U.S. ports. The bill was originally submitted to the Senate by Senator Barkley and to the House of Representatives by Representative McCormack, a Democrat from Massachusetts. President Roosevelt told reporters that he personally did not want the power to execute this act, but it was clear that someone had to have the power to execute it. The President also stated that the new bill does not in any way overturn the Johnson Act, which prohibits loans to certain countries that have not paid interest on their war debts (from the previous European war). This new bill, entitled the "Act to Promote the Defense of the United States," stipulates that "regardless of the provisions of any other law, the President may, at any time he deems it beneficial to national defense, authorize the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, or the heads of other departments to execute the following: 1. Manufacture any weapons in arsenals to supply the defense of any country that the President deems to be of significant importance to the defense of the United States. 2. Supply such countries with any defense article by sale, transfer, exchange, lease, or other means of disposal. 3. Test, inspect, repair, equip, calibrate, or modify defense articles ordered by other governments. 4. Transmit defense information to foreign governments. 5. Export any defense article to such countries." The term "defense article" refers to any weapon, ammunition, aircraft, warship, machine, facility, tool, raw material, or other supply necessary for manufacturing, production, and repair. (United Press, 9th)

Washington - During yesterday's Senate debate on the Lend-Lease Act, the first action was to reject an amendment stipulating that new-type warships and aircraft shall not be transferred to other countries, except for aircraft that are currently under construction internally and can be replenished within six months. Some senators believe that this amendment is the last effort by the opposition to limit the President's powers under the bill. An amendment proposed by the ruling party, stipulating that agricultural products may be included in the category of defense articles that can be transferred to other countries, has been adopted by the Senate. It is generally speculated that President Roosevelt, after approving the Lend-Lease Act, will first ship out large quantities of war materiel currently not in use by the U.S. Army and Navy. If there is a shortage of adequate transport ships, the U.S. authorities will find ways to acquire them, such as legislation allowing the Maritime Commission to charter 37 Danish ships currently docked in U.S. ports. These Danish ships cannot currently be used because they cannot obtain war risk insurance from private insurance companies. It is also speculated that the new U.S. destroyers will enter service, so the old destroyers will be transferred to Britain, but this has not yet been confirmed. In short, there is no doubt that Roosevelt wants to provide an immediate shield for democracies after the Lend-Lease Act becomes law. (Reuters, 9th)

### U.S. is Rapidly Moving Towards Preparedness, Central Air Defense Headquarters to be Established

Washington - The United States yesterday moved swiftly towards wartime measures in peacetime. The Senate passed the epoch-making Lend-Lease Act, and the Department of War established a supreme air defense command. This air defense command will establish an Air Force headquarters to oversee the organization, training, and operations of the Air Force in the continental United States during peacetime. The headquarters will be moved from Langley Field to Bolling Field, and will be commanded by Major General Emmons. The Department of War will expand the existing 48 Army flight schools and increase the number of recruits as much as possible to accommodate the strength of 48,000 aircraft. The government also plans to submit a request to Congress in the near future for an additional US$1,000,000,000 to build an additional 12,000 aircraft. The Department of War announced that the Army plans to increase its armored forces, possibly from eight to ten divisions next year. The Department of War also announced that it has adopted a rotation policy for reserve officers in order to train more reservists. The Navy and War Departments have also requested Congress to appropriate US$115,000,000 to supplement the educational expenses of children of active-duty officers. (United Press, 9th)

Washington - The U.S. government announced that it will establish a central air defense command, headed by Lieutenant General Emmons. It also stated that the Navy Department will spend US$18,000,000 to establish a new air force training base in Corpus Christi, Texas, taking the 50,000-aircraft plan one step further. (International News Service, 9th)

### U.S. Warship Carrying Munitions Arrives in the Philippines

Manila - The U.S. cruiser "Trenton" arrived here today from Honolulu, but it is reported that the ship will return to Honolulu next week. It is understood that the ship is carrying aircraft parts and munitions, similar to the "Cincinnati" which recently arrived here. (United Press, 9th)

### U.S. Navy Department Considering Adopting Six-Day Work Week to Accelerate Completion of Two-Ocean Navy

Washington - According to recent statements by senior officials, the Navy Department is currently considering adopting a six-day work week system to accelerate the completion of the two-ocean navy. The official stated that the authorities have instructed the directors of various shipyards to encourage workers to speed up work. It was also mentioned that they may even abandon the five-day (40-hour) work week system. Navy officials stated that the government cannot order workers in private factories to work longer hours each day unless the workers voluntarily agree to do so. The government has announced to the workers, "They are indeed part of the Navy." President Roosevelt has announced that an emergency situation exists, requiring the accelerated construction of naval bases acquired by the country, and extending the working hours of workers in that area. He can announce the adoption of a six-day work week in the shipbuilding process in the same way. The House Naval Affairs Committee has temporarily postponed the investigation into the production of naval aircraft and is considering two bills to accelerate the completion of the Navy's shipbuilding and armament plan, and to increase the fleet's anti-aircraft defenses. The proposal to adopt a six-day system in ordinary national defense industries was proposed by Mr. Martin, an aircraft manufacturer from Baltimore, whose factory is currently rushing to build 311 cruiser bombers for the Navy. He said that the adoption of a six-day system is essential to expedite the national defense program, as it can increase production by 12 to 15 percent. He also suggested that the government should requisition workers and factories in times of emergency so that the national defense program is not affected. Chairman Vinson of the House Naval Affairs Committee stated when postponing the investigation into naval aircraft production that the Navy Department is extremely eager to accelerate production and establish a constitution for anti-aircraft defense. One bill will use US$315,000,000 to expand shipbuilding facilities and US$194,000,000 to increase the manufacture of military supplies. Another bill will use US$300,000,000 to enhance the fleet's anti-aircraft guns and equipment. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated in a letter to the committee that anti-aircraft equipment is extremely necessary because the European war has clearly revealed this need. He said that many of the details are military secrets and cannot be disclosed, but it is said that the Navy Department plans to install steel plates on warships to strengthen resistance to aircraft bombing. Former Assistant Secretary of Labor McGrady has been hired as a special labor issues advisor to Secretary Knox and has also been hired by Secretary of War Stimson to do the same work.

### President Roosevelt Broadcasts Speech Celebrating U.S. Rural Program

Washington - President Roosevelt broadcast a speech last night, celebrating the anniversary of the U.S. government's rural program, stating that American agriculture is now fully prepared to fulfill its due responsibility in the overall national defense. American warehouses are full, and the food and clothing stored are sufficient to meet domestic needs, and can also meet the needs of friends overseas who are fighting for survival, those who are fighting for various democratic systems, those who are fighting against dictators to rule the world. American agricultural production has not suffered any setbacks, which is gratifying. The rural front is now prepared to meet any needs of the entire defense. Regarding the general issue of the President and the future of democracy, he said that those who live in a democratic country have a collective responsibility that cannot be escaped. We may fulfill this responsibility in an unwise manner, but we cannot escape the consequences of the path we have chosen. (Reuters, 9th)

### Confirmation of Matsuoka's Visit to Europe

Berlin - According to an official announcement yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will visit Berlin in the near future at the invitation of the German government. During his stay in Germany, Matsuoka will participate in discussions on various cooperation issues stipulated in the Tripartite Pact. After completing discussions in Germany, Matsuoka will travel to Rome. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

Berlin - The German political circles are greatly satisfied after the official confirmation of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Berlin. It is said that this is the first visit to Europe by a Japanese cabinet member. Those concerned point out that the Tripartite Pact has a global nature and believe that the consultation between the politician responsible for Japanese foreign policy and the leaders of the German Nazi Party will make this pact more solid. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

Berlin - Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima declared to a reporter from the "People's Observer" yesterday that the construction of a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is Japan's unwavering goal. He does not believe that the United States will use force to stop Japan, but if the United States does take force, it will be of no benefit. Japan hopes to obtain understanding from the United States. The United States seems to misunderstand Japan's peaceful efforts. Japan does not provoke Saxon countries, but is always prepared to take necessary action. All human beings have the right to live happily, and Britain oppresses the peoples of East Asia and makes them slaves. All nations have the right to live and be happy. Japan's goal is to achieve this happiness. Oshima firmly believes that Germany will be victorious. Germany is in a superior position politically, militarily, and economically. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)

### Storm on the East Coast of the United States

New York - States along the Atlantic coast have been swept by a major snowstorm. The snow depth in the New York City area is one foot, and traffic is blocked. The trawler "Cottage" ran aground five miles north of Ocean City. Due to the strong winds and waves, the Coast Guard's patrol boat could not rescue it. Gale warnings have been posted in various coastal areas. Washington experienced the worst February snowfall in its history, reaching a depth of 10.1 inches. (United Press, 9th)

### Moscow Celebrates International Women's Day

Moscow - Thirty million women engaged in Soviet agriculture and industry held celebrations yesterday to celebrate International Women's Day. Communist Party Secretary Arva issued an official statement, calling on all women, in this time of "approaching war," to prepare to replace their brothers in factories and fields, and to prepare to serve as nurses, and, if necessary, to take up arms and go to war.

### Soviet Union Transfers Troops to Strengthen Black Sea Defenses, Turkey Determined to Resist Aggression, Will Receive Soviet Support if it Enters the War

Vichy - According to diplomatic sources, the Soviet Union is now transferring troops to the Black Sea region to strengthen its defenses there. As a result, Turkey can transfer troops from the Caucasus border to the Thracian border. It is reported that Stalin convened an emergency meeting last week with the Foreign Minister, the Defense Minister, and the commanders of the Army and Navy. The Kiev and Odessa military districts have been reinforced with four mechanized brigades, 500 aircraft, and countless anti-aircraft guns. Most of the naval personnel are transferred to the Black Sea from the Baltic Sea and the Arctic Ocean, most of them submarine personnel. However, authoritative sources believe that German-Soviet relations have not been affected by the events of this week. The Soviet Union is merely preventing the danger of war breaking out in the Tatar Strait area. (United Press, 9th)

London - There are now many indications that Hitler is using all his power to drive British forces out of the Mediterranean. Non-British diplomatic circles are extremely anxious about the fate of Greece's future, believing that if Hitler can force Greece to give up resistance, Britain's prestige will be completely swept away. However, it is also believed that Hitler may not immediately use full-scale blitzkrieg tactics, because first, the events of this week have proven that Turkey will never go to war unless enemy forces invade its territory, but it is determined to resist; second, after Turkey joins the war, it may receive open or covert assistance from the Soviet Union. Hitler's strategy of nibbling away at Yugoslavia will eventually lead the country to join the Axis. Most observers believe that the entire Balkans, with the exception of Turkey, are not only in immediate danger of falling into Hitler's hands, but the Aegean Sea will also be occupied by German forces. Some sources believe that after Germany resolves the issues of Greece and Yugoslavia, it will attack Turkey from three sides: Greece, Bulgaria, and French Syria. (United Press, 9th)

Cairo - Hitler's Balkan blitzkrieg does not seem as imminent as rumored, for the following reasons: First, the German army has not yet transported enough mechanized vehicles and aircraft from the Western Front, which is not enough to break through the fortresses in the mountains of Southern Europe; second, although Germany has taken over Romania and Bulgaria without bloodshed, the military intimidation procedures in the Balkans have not been completed, and Yugoslavia will be tempted to follow in Bulgaria's footsteps. After Yugoslavia joins the Axis, Turkey's position will be weakened, and then it can concentrate on Greece. (United Press, 9th)

### Germany Stations Troops on Border, Coercing Greece to Abandon Resistance, Rumored to Have Issued Note Containing "Ultimatum" Requiring Severance of Relations with Britain and Cession of Bases to Germany

Capital of Yugoslavia - The German ambassador to Greece has presented a note to Greek Prime Minister Koryzis stating that the only way to avoid the tragedy of war in the Balkans is to end the Greco-Italian war. (United Press, 9th)

Sofia - According to the impressions here yesterday, Germany's "ultimatum" to Greece will be presented within a week or several days, ordering Greece to accept German demands within 24 hours, including negotiating peace with Italy, severing relations with Britain, revising the border with Bulgaria, ceding bases such as Thessaloniki and Patras to Germany, and completely demobilizing the Greek army. Seven German divisions are currently stationed on the Greek border, and troops are also moving within Romania. In the first three days of last week, two German divisions boarded trains in Vienna and headed to Romania. (Reuters, 9th)

Greece Urgently Appeals to Turkey to Fulfill Obligation to Assist

Capital of Yugoslavia - According to reports arriving here today, Greece, due to the possibility of German troops invading from Bulgaria at any time, is now pressuring Turkey to give Greece a guarantee of assistance. At the same time, Yugoslavia has reached the point of signing an agreement with Germany, and it is expected that a non-aggression pact will be signed in Berlin on Tuesday. It is reported that Yugoslavia has mobilized a large army of nearly one million people to strengthen its defense mechanism in case of emergency. Because Yugoslavia has already half joined the Axis camp, it is reported that Greece has formally asked Turkey whether the Turkish army is prepared to attack the German flank in the Thracian region of Greece. The Greek ambassador to Ankara has requested Turkey to immediately declare whether it will abide by the 1933 Greco-Turkish mutual assistance pact, according to which Greece and Turkey should defend their common Thracian border against any aggression. Greece has also requested Turkey to reaffirm its attitude towards the 1934 Balkan Entente, but observers believe that the pact is just a piece of paper because the signatory countries of Romania and Bulgaria cannot fulfill their obligations to Greece and Turkey. Authoritative sources in Ankara indicate that if Turkey believes that the German invasion of Greece is a threat to Turkey, then Turkey may help Greece resist Germany, but whether Turkey will automatically intervene has not been answered. The Greeks seem to be eager for a "yes" or "no" answer. (International Telegraph)

### Greek Government Spokesman States Prefer to Die Than Surrender, Opposes Signing Armistice Agreement with Italy, Openly Reprimands Hitler in Public Letter

Athens - A government spokesman declared here yesterday that Greece will not sign an armistice agreement with Italy. Prior to this declaration, local newspapers published an open letter to Hitler, explaining why Greece sought aid from Britain. The spokesman stated, "Any idea of an armistice with Italy will be opposed by Greece. Greece is not interested in an armistice with Italy and is determined to fight to the end." The open letter to Hitler was published in the "Kathimerini" daily newspaper and was personally signed by Mr. Vlachos, the most influential editor in Greece. The letter questions why Germany wants to attack Greece.

The letter recounts the events before the war, stating, "When Greece knew that Prime Minister Mussolini's signature was worthless, it did not appeal to Britain. It appealed to Your Excellency (Hitler). I do not know the content of Your Excellency's reply, but I learned from General Metaxas (the recently deceased Greek Prime Minister) that Germany ordered us not to mobilize and to remain calm so as not to give the Italians an excuse. We did indeed comply with Your Excellency's advice, but Italy finally attacked us. Who did we appeal to at that time? We did appeal to Your Excellency! Your Excellency was in Florence that day. We could not fight alone, so we began to seek aid from Britain. Although Britain itself was in distress at that time, it immediately sent aid to us. Since then, we have defeated Italy on our own. Britain has never had a single soldier on Albanian territory. Your Excellency once told us that Germany would take a bystander's attitude towards the Greco-Italian war, and would only intervene if British troops landed in Thessaloniki." The letter continues, "Your Excellency is now stationing troops in Romania and is preparing on the road to Sofia, or even in the process of entering Sofia. We now see German troops crossing the Danube and entering Sofia, and we cannot help but think that Your Excellency intends to invade Greece. Is Your Excellency doing this to help Italy? If so, we can save them and let them withdraw from Albania! Your Excellency will also ask us what we will do with the British troops in Greece. We never urged them to come. It was the Italians who urged them to come. How can we let them leave? What can we say to the British who died for us? We will defend this together until the storm passes. Our troops will continue to fight if necessary. Greece will show the world how to fight, as in Epirus and Greece in the past!" (United Press, 9th)

### British King Goes to Scotland to Inspect Navy and Air Force

London - The King and Queen drove to a naval air station on the coast of Scotland on Friday to inspect the Navy and Air Force. They spent the night at the Scottish residence, guarded by Polish soldiers. It is a historical first for foreign soldiers to guard the British King. (Reuters, 9th)

### Nazi Iron Fist Diplomacy Works in the Balkans: Germany and Yugoslavia to Sign Non-Aggression Pact, Similar in Nature to the Turkish-Bulgarian Agreement

Belgrade: Germany's iron fist diplomacy has proven effective in the Balkans. The Yugoslavian people are understandably alarmed, and the Yugoslavian government finds itself in a very difficult position. Various political and diplomatic activities have taken place in the Yugoslavian capital over the past 48 hours. Prince Regent Paul has received staff officers and other important figures. The united opposition party issued a statement on Friday expressing the nation's great concern over the government's future decisions. Those currently in charge still believe that Germany will not force Yugoslavia to sign the Tripartite Pact, and even if Germany were to do so, Yugoslavia would be unwilling to comply. However, the possibility remains that Yugoslavia will declare its continued friendship with the Axis powers. Although Yugoslavian newspapers insist that Yugoslavia will continue its policy of peace and non-participation in the war, they also emphasize the good relations between Yugoslavia and Germany. At the same time, Yugoslavia's war preparedness plans are under consideration. The current situation can be summarized in two points: first, Britain's deep sympathy for the people who are preparing to resist Germany; and second, the difficult position of the Yugoslavian government in the face of German pressure. The Yugoslavian government has so far stood firm, and the character of the Yugoslavian people is well known to Germany. Therefore, Germany may seek to end the Italian-Greek war without making any military demands on Yugoslavia. (Reuters, 9th)

Belgrade: It is now understood that a Yugoslav-German non-aggression pact will be signed in Berlin on Tuesday. It is expected that the wording of the pact will be similar to Yugoslavia's friendship agreements with Italy and Bulgaria, and the recent Turkish-Bulgarian agreement. None of the aforementioned agreements involve any specific obligations. (Reuters, 9th)

Cabinet Meeting Reviews the Situation

Belgrade, Yugoslavia: The cabinet held an important meeting this morning to discuss the attitude Yugoslavia should adopt towards the current situation. The meeting had not adjourned by the afternoon. It is generally believed here that the cabinet meeting will reach a decision on the issue of Yugoslavia accepting Germany's proposal to sign a friendship treaty or joining the new European order. Therefore, it is also possible that Yugoslavia will allow Germany to transport military equipment through its territory. In short, the official announcement of Yugoslavia's attitude will be made soon. The fact that Cabinet Minister Maček plans to go to Zagreb for a weekend vacation indicates that the cabinet has already reached an agreement. Assuming that Yugoslavia and Germany sign a friendship treaty, it will be roughly the same as the 1937 Yugoslav-Italian friendship treaty. In addition, representatives from the military and the Slovene, Serbian, and Croatian communities participated in repeated consultations between the government and the leaders of various political parties. This is extremely important. (Havas, 8th)

Maintaining Neutrality: Policy Unchanged

The Politika newspaper in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, recently published an article strongly defending Yugoslavia's policy of neutrality, stating that the policies pursued by the Balkan countries are based on unity. In recent years, this spirit has gradually materialized. Although the current situation is full of difficulties and it has not been possible to fully implement it, past experiences have left a deep mark. Even today, the peoples of the Balkans have not forgotten this. As for Yugoslavia, it once spared no sacrifice to safeguard peace and order in the Balkans. Today, it is more difficult than before to maintain peace in the Balkans, but Yugoslavia should still adhere to its policy of "peace and non-interference in the current European war." In terms of foreign relations, Yugoslavia attaches great importance to its friendly relations with Germany. A German official stated a few days ago that the diplomatic relations between Germany and Yugoslavia are exceptionally good. This statement is indeed very valuable. In addition, the "Vreme" newspaper published an editorial strongly advocating that Yugoslavia should participate in cooperation with the new European order led by the Axis powers. (Havas, 8th)

### Greek Forces Launch Offensive in the Tepelene District: Italian Troops Suffer Heavy Casualties, Over a Thousand Captured

Athens: The Greek High Command announced this morning that yesterday was the second day of the new offensive launched by the Greek forces in the Tepelene district of the Albanian front. Over a thousand Italian soldiers were captured. The communiqué stated, "Greek forces have captured a large number of weapons and ammunition. Greek warplanes have bombed important targets on the battlefield with considerable effect." (International News Agency, 9th)

Athens: Yesterday, the Italian forces launched several counterattacks in the central Albanian front, but they were all repulsed by the Greek forces. The enemy suffered heavy losses, with many dead and wounded, and many were captured by the Greek forces. It has been verified that the Greek forces captured 1,050 Italian officers and soldiers on Friday. According to the latest news from the front, the Greek forces intercepted an urgent telegram from the Italian front line to its base requesting the immediate dispatch of medical supplies. This shows the victory of the Greek forces on Friday. People in Athens believe that this is a sign that Greece is determined to maintain its offensive power in Albania. (Reuters, 9th)

### German Submarine Activity: Attacks British Ships

Berlin: The German military communiqué this afternoon stated that German submarines sank a total of 18,000 tons of enemy merchant ships. (Haitong, 9th)

Berlin: According to German military experts, German torpedo boats sank two British destroyers and 28,400 tons of merchant ships in the past few days. During this period, the blows to the enemy were particularly heavy. The recent agreement between Britain and the United States to transfer warships shows the enemy's urgent need. Yesterday's German submarine report stated that five British ships with a total of 33,000 tons were sunk. In the first week of March, Britain lost a total of 116,261 tons. (Haitong, 9th)

### The Painful History of the European War (VII): The Blunders of the Anglo-French Allied Forces in the Early Stages of the War

I have seen many admirable troops on all fronts, especially the motorized divisions, which are most commendable. However, the reports of several clear-headed French commanders were discouraging. One evening, a division commander in North Africa told me frankly that he hoped to negotiate peace.

He said, "The German forces far outnumber the Allied forces, and their equipment is far superior to anything France can hope to match. The disparity in strength between the two sides is vast. Although my men are brave and good fighters, no less so than others, how can they stop the enemy's armored divisions if they don't have flat trajectory guns and are empty-handed?"

Even General Giraud, who was known for his adventurous courage, believed that we could not launch an offensive before 1941. He told me, "Things are terribly bad, and we have too many shortcomings. The first is airplanes. As a corps commander, can you guess how many planes I command? Frankly, only eight! Not one more! Of course, there are elite British air forces that can help me, but if I want them to make a reconnaissance flight, I must first ask General Georges, who in turn asks General Gamelin, who in turn asks Air Chief Marshal Barratt, who then forwards it to Deputy Commander Blount, and finally he orders the mission to be carried out. By the time this process is complete, the opportunity has already been lost. What use is it?"

I asked, "What if the Germans preemptively strike? What if they invade Belgium?"

He replied, "If that happens, we will have to deal with them this year, which will be very difficult."

The Germans gave us eight months of rest and preparation. How will our factories use these eight months? It's terrible! There are several reasons for this, which will be explained one by one below.

First, the military supply department's guidance on industrial mobilization was too clumsy. Skilled workers, who were essential for manufacturing aircraft and artillery, were assigned to various barracks and did odd jobs all day long. It would take at least several months to find out where they were, recall them, and get them back to work. As a result, the Renault factory, which normally had more than 30,000 workers and should have played an important role in the manufacture of vehicles and trucks, suddenly saw its workforce reduced to 6,000 or 7,000 when the war broke out. This was truly unexpected!

Second, engineers and financiers adhered to the precedents of 1914, assuming that the war would last for four or five years, and all plans were based on this assumption. As a result, although new factories were built, they could not deliver goods until 1941 or even 1942. They did not want to make full use of France's existing factories, nor did they order tanks and aircraft engines from the United States, only the latest models of machinery. All the gold and silver in Britain and France was carefully preserved for the long-term war, dividing it into four or five parts, each part intended for one year's use. Large factories in the United States could have supplied the Allied forces with urgently needed equipment in a timely manner, but they never received orders from Britain and France. It is said that the engines made in France were cheaper." Little did they know that the price would be the great tragedy of defeat.

Third, all plans were based on the assumption of a protracted war. The staff department made long-term preparations for attacking the Siegfried Line in Germany. They calculated how many heavy artillery pieces were needed to carry out the attack, and the precision was truly admirable. However, when France was ordering these heavy artillery pieces, it was in urgent need of flat trajectory guns, anti-aircraft guns, and light and heavy machine guns. German patrols on the Saar front were carrying light submachine guns, so French patrols also asked their superiors to issue them. But there wasn't even one to be had. When German paratroopers began to land, French officers were ordered to carry pistols. But all the pistols in France had been rounded up. Speaking for myself, I traveled all the way to Paris to search, but I couldn't buy one. Later, I ordered one from Italy in early June, but it was too late.

Fourth, the decline in morale and political disputes further hindered factory production. From the day Germany and the Soviet Union joined hands, Communist workers, although they did not openly resist, had no intention of working. In addition, the fact that factory profits were almost entirely prohibited made small business owners feel disheartened. In 1914, small factories and car factories were busy manufacturing artillery shells, but this never happened in this war. The speed of work in France remained the same as in peacetime for several months.

In mid-October 1939, Reynaud was serving as Minister of Finance. One day, after dinner, he decided to patrol several munitions factories in Paris, but he saw that the gates of all the factories were closed, and no night work was being done, which shocked him greatly. The next day, he went to warn Daladier, "If this continues, we will be defeated, do you know that?"

Daladier smiled and dismissed it, and even we at the time thought it was not credible. Little did we know that his words were absolutely true.

Later, an able engineer, Dautry, took over as Minister of Armaments, and the situation changed dramatically, but it was too late. I have great respect for him. He was short and stocky, and when he talked to people, he often half-closed his left eye, looking at the other person slyly. He had outstanding achievements in every position he held. When people asked him the secret to his success, he always said, "I have a secret, which is to work hard."

The Ministry of Armaments was located in the Hotel du Louvre. Dautry arrived at dawn and busied himself signing red papers, issuing urgent orders to the heads of the departments under him. By the time his subordinates arrived at work, they had already found the minister's instructions placed on their desks, requiring them to respond that day. Dautry's "red documents" were simple and direct, and sometimes even carried a bit of sarcasm, which had been widely circulated. Here are a few examples:

To all department heads: "The department members' late arrivals and early departures will be investigated."

To Mr. A: "I know the weather is nice, and I also know the weather is hot, but I know even more that we are at war. I don't want to see a certain commander sitting by the window smoking a cigar and enjoying the fresh air."

To Mr. B: "Whenever there are workers, they should be urged to use them to manage everything, maintain order, pick up scrap iron, clean gutters, and sweep roads. Don't let anyone be idle. It is the responsibility of the department head to manage and guide."

To a certain factory owner: "All the machinery in France must work 24 hours a day. Although this is difficult, it is necessary. I will not ask about other trivial matters. I need everything, and I need it immediately. The goal is to 'quickly achieve victory.' The method is to 'force what cannot be done.'"

But when I talked to him alone, I found that this person, who was usually full of energy and self-confidence, was also a little disturbed and pessimistic.

I asked him, "When will you be able to provide the army with everything it needs?"

He said, "Everything? It's impossible before 1942. We started too late."

He was a person who went forward and persevered to the end, but he could not create miracles. Germany had already taken the lead several years ago, so it was natural that we could not catch up.

In January, I was sent to England to inspect British armaments. They showed me the North Sea Fleet, the Air Force Academy, the Army training camp, and the factories that manufactured aircraft and artillery. The measures taken by the Admiralty seemed impeccable. Although the Air Force was small in number, it was also commendable. As for the Army, even the French military delegation did not know how many troops were being trained.

I returned to Alas in February. At that time, the people of the neutral countries no longer believed that we would win. Even in Italy, Mussolini, although he leaned towards Germany, was able to remain impartial at the beginning of the war. However, by February, he had determined that Britain and France had wasted the entire winter, and the disparity in strength between the two sides had increased. As a result, his attitude changed dramatically. The Italian radio station's female announcer, who broadcast in French, initially spoke in a gentle tone, then suddenly became cold, and finally even mocked us. My friends who met Italians all anticipated the danger ahead. At that time, Mussolini had made up his mind and was only waiting for a favorable opportunity.

In short, from September 1939 to May 1940, many British and French people did work hard, but most of their efforts were wasted. (The End)

### Vichy's Reply Sent to Tokyo Yesterday: Temporary Agreement Not Yet Signed, Conflicts Erupt Again on Thai-Vietnamese Border

Tokyo: Reliable sources announced that the full text of Vichy's instructions regarding the Thai-Vietnamese treaty arrived in Tokyo today. However, the signing of the temporary agreement must wait until tomorrow afternoon after Foreign Minister Matsuoka's meeting with French Ambassador Henri. The agreement was originally scheduled to be signed today, but it had to be postponed due to the delay in receiving a response from the French side. The Thai side's reply was received and forwarded to Matsuoka last night. (United Press, 9th)

Tokyo: Well-informed Japanese sources said that the Thai-French peace agreement could be temporarily signed today. It is believed that the Vichy government's response to the five basic principles of understanding reached last Sunday will arrive here today, at which time the agreement can be signed. The Thai side's reply arrived last night. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke will meet with French and Thai representatives as soon as the instructions arrive. (United Press, 9th)

Hanoi: Japanese sources have repeatedly claimed that the peace negotiations between Thai and French representatives in Tokyo are about to result in a formal agreement, but this cannot be confirmed here. The official silence, on the contrary, is sufficient to imply that the difficulties encountered in the negotiations have not yet been completely eliminated. This assumption is in stark contrast to the general public opinion expressed by Japanese newspapers in recent days. (Havas, 8th)

Bangkok: The High Command announced that it had notified the Japanese government that French forces had violated the armistice agreement in three locations on the Thai-Vietnamese border on Friday and Saturday. This action is sufficient to affect Japan's success in mediating the Thai-Vietnamese dispute. As a result of these three conflicts, two Thai non-commissioned officers and one policeman are missing. (United Press, 9th)

London: The Times reviews Japan's method of mediating the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, saying that after France's final hesitation, the solution to the Thai-Vietnamese dispute proposed by the Japanese government has apparently been accepted by both sides, with only a few details remaining to be discussed. This solution must be judged by its overall result. Britain has always maintained close and friendly relations with Thailand. Thailand's demands on Vietnam have been going on for a long time, and now that a peaceful solution has been reached, Britain, in ordinary circumstances, would have no other reason than to be satisfied. The Thai-Vietnamese war, which was of no benefit to either side, has now been avoided, and at least this is a comfort to both sides. However, the procedures that led to this solution cannot be said to be inseparable from mediation. Japanese troops have occupied part of Vietnamese territory. In addition to the direct threat to the local area, there is also pressure from Berlin on the Vichy government. In this environment, it is almost impossible to say that the Vichy government or the Vietnamese authorities voluntarily accepted this solution. From a distance, the Indian-Thai government may not feel particularly satisfied with the gathering of Japanese warships and aircraft near the areas they are competing for. The necessary qualifications for a mediator always lie in being impartial and having no vested interests, but Japan has already admitted that it has vested interests in the Southeast Asian events. What Japan will take as a reward for its role as a mediator remains to be seen. Japanese spokesmen have repeatedly said that the interference and mediation of other countries is not welcome or tolerable to Japan. These remarks cannot dispel the doubts arising from Japan's declaration of its position in Southeast Asia. When Japanese authorities were negotiating the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, attempting to restore the borders to their state a hundred years ago, they unfortunately encouraged clumsy rumors, pointing to Britain as obstructing the solution. Newspapers that received official instructions did their utmost to slander Britain, even fabricating the claim that Chinese troops were replacing Indian troops to defend Burma, in order to incite anti-British sentiment in Tokyo. If Japan blames Britain for the suspicions caused by its policies, it must know that Japan's advocacy of leaning towards the Axis powers has certainly painted its ability to create suspicion between Britain and Australia. Britain's views have been expressed by British Prime Minister Churchill to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, and Australian Prime Minister Menzies has also made them clear in a public speech. Menzies's words were initially misunderstood, but those who heard his voice in person would not regard it as appeasement. What Menzies expects is candor, which is often faked in international relations. Words and deeds should be consistent. Wherever there are conflicts of interest, they may be discussed with each other. Menzies is certainly prepared to do so, but only if both parties do so. (Reuters, 9th)

### Germany Boasts of Attacking Britain: Will Use New Weapons, London Suffers Another Brutal Air Raid, Bombs Rain Down, Casualties Heavy

Berlin: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels declared to reporters here yesterday that previous claims by Britain that Germany would specify a date for invading Britain had all failed. This was a fabrication by the British. Hitler never specified a date, except for what he said in his speech, that the war would be decided this year. As for the super airplanes and flying fortresses that the British are talking about, which can fly 5,000 kilometers and carry 5,000 kilograms of bombs, we know what kind of airplanes the Americans can build, but we have a weapon that will make the enemy panic when it is launched. Let the British wait and see. Germany is not afraid of the extension of the front line. Germany's manpower and material resources are so numerous that they cannot be counted. There is nowhere to store the output of military supplies. Before long, a general offensive will be launched on all fronts simultaneously. Since the beginning of the war, there have not been seven consecutive days of clear weather. If there are four weeks of weather suitable for flying, Britain will suffer a disaster like that of last September. (Haitong, 9th)

London: The all-clear siren sounded this morning after German planes made the most intense raid on this city in weeks. Hundreds of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped in a crisscross pattern over London by a swarm of German planes, so it is believed that there were heavy casualties. A bomb hit an air raid shelter, killing and wounding all the people taking refuge there. A bomb fell on a nightclub, killing and wounding many people. Another bomb fell on a street, killing and wounding countless passersby. Firefighters tried their best to put out the fires, but the high-explosive bombs hindered their progress. While German bombs were raining down, London's anti-aircraft guns fired back fiercely for several hours. (United Press, 9th)

London: Last night's air raid on London was the most intense in several weeks. The enemy planes ignored the heavy anti-aircraft fire and kept dropping bombs. First, they dropped flares and incendiary bombs, then high-explosive bombs. The British shot down many flares with light anti-aircraft guns, and the incendiary bombs were quickly extinguished by firefighters. A bomb that fell in the West End destroyed about ten houses, but there were no reports of heavy casualties. This morning, German planes flew close to the east coast of England and Scotland and dropped several bombs. Officials announced that, apart from a few houses destroyed in East Anglia, there was no major damage and few casualties. The Air Ministry said that there was nothing to report yesterday afternoon, but an air raid alert sounded in London at night and gunshots were heard. Two German bombers were indeed destroyed yesterday afternoon, so a total of three enemy planes have been destroyed since Friday night. As for the claim that a third enemy plane was destroyed yesterday, it has not been confirmed. (Reuters, 9th)

### Italian Armed Merchant Ship Sunk: In the Indian Ocean

London: The Admiralty issued a communiqué this morning stating that an Italian merchant ship, equipped with four 4.7-inch guns, which had been attacking merchant ships at sea, has now been captured in the Indian Ocean by the New Zealand cruiser "Leander." It has been verified that the Italian ship was the "Ramb I," with a displacement of 3,667 tons and a speed of 18.5 knots per hour. It was owned by the Italian government. When it was intercepted by the "Leander," it opened fire in resistance, but caught fire after being hit and sank into the sea after 50 minutes. The crew of 11 officers and 85 sailors were rescued by the "Leander" and are now prisoners of war. The "Leander" suffered no casualties or damage. (Reuters, 9th)

London: A British Admiralty communiqué stated that on March 6, the Italian submarine "Anfitrite" attempted to attack a British convoy in the Aegean Sea but was immediately sunk by an aircraft escorting the convoy. (Reuters, 9th)

### British Forces Advance in East Africa: Only 100 Miles from the Abyssinian Capital, Patriotic Abyssinian Troops Assist in Combat, Blackshirt Fighters Suffer Heavy Casualties

Khartoum: The joint forces of the British Army, the Sudanese Army, and the patriotic Abyssinian troops pursued the Italian forces all the way to Danbacha, only 170 miles from the Abyssinian capital. Italian troops fleeing from Buriye and other places were attacked by Abyssinian troops led by British officers, and then pursued from the rear and flanks by the Sudanese Army. They were eventually forced to flee to Danbacha on Friday night. The enemy suffered more than 30,000 casualties, abandoned more than a hundred corpses along the way, as well as many machine guns and armored vehicles. The British suffered very few casualties. One officer was wounded. (Reuters, 9th)

### America Changes Garrison Commander, Does Not Give Up Rights in the East China Sea, Rumors of American Troops Returning Home Spontaneously Disappear, Asian Fleet Can Sail to Shanghai Next Month

Yesterday, the US Navy Department decided to transfer Colonel Howard to Shanghai as commander of the US 4th Marine Regiment, and Colonel Baker, the original commander, was recalled to the Navy Department. After the news reached here, people from all walks of life expressed great excitement, believing that this move had the same effect as the transfer of Ambassador Gao. Diplomatic and military personnel transfers symbolize America's determination to respond to changes in the Far East, and in Shanghai, it will not give up any traditional and unified legal rights. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency specifically inquired about this matter with the US Navy in this port, and received the following information:

America Strengthens Shanghai Garrison

The rumors that the US garrison in Shanghai was about to withdraw were partly due to speculators trying to manipulate the market and partly due to invaders deliberately making dangerous claims to sensationalize the public. The US Navy authorities were not unaware of these rumors, but they did not recognize them because they believed that the facts spoke louder than words. If the US garrison in this port was to withdraw due to "the pressure of the invaders," then what would be the point of transferring the commander? Now that the authorities have decided to transfer such an important official to this important location during this important period, it can be seen that the authorities have decided to maintain the garrison in Shanghai, and all arguments about the American troops returning home can be refuted without attacking them. Furthermore, the UK and the US have the most rights and interests in Shanghai. Now that the British troops have withdrawn, the heavy responsibility of protecting British and American rights and interests falls entirely on the US 4th Marine Regiment. If the US troops were to withdraw after the British troops, it would mean that the UK and the US were willing to completely abandon their dominant position in Shanghai. But are the UK and the US really willing to do so?

Concession Situation Not Serious

However, this does not mean that the situation in the Far East will not deteriorate. Because Japan is determined to advance south, and the UK and the US are not willing to yield, the two are like fire and water, and are incompatible. Therefore, the possibility of a direct conflict is very high, which cannot be denied. However, the impact of the war on Shanghai may not be as serious as imagined, because the center of the war is in Southeast Asia and not in Shanghai, and Japan may not seize the Shanghai International Settlement. Because the neutrality of the concession, from the current situation, is actually beneficial to Japan. Japan can use this as the last means to seize foreign exchange, and even the British and American expatriates in Shanghai are not in danger of being concentrated and guarded. However, the expatriates of the two countries are gradually withdrawing, but only the general women, children, and men who are not necessary to stay in Shanghai are withdrawing. Moreover, this move does not represent a crisis of war, but only expresses the authorities' precautionary measures and tough stance in response to the invaders. Under this logic, the American garrison can continue to stay in Shanghai until it is no longer necessary.

American Ships Will Come to Shanghai From the Philippines

America's firm stance has a great power as its backing. This great power, when necessary, will strike those who need to be struck. This is none other than the US Asian Fleet currently stationed in the Philippines. It is rumored that the Asian Fleet will not come to China this year, but this statement is absolutely unreliable. The US Asian Fleet usually advances south in winter and is stationed in the Philippines, and in late spring and early summer, it moves to the sea off North China. According to regulations, it sails into the Chinese sea before April, and at the end of May, it is stationed in Qingdao and Yantai. If the prediction is not wrong, then in April this year, Admiral Hurd will lead a powerful fleet to Shanghai. Currently, the strength of the fleet has been greatly increased. In addition to the addition of the cruiser Cincinnati, more than ten other destroyers and submarines have been added. Even the number of aircraft has been greatly increased.

America Does Not Want War, But Is Not Afraid of War

It is deeply believed that in the event of a war between the US and Japan, this Asian Fleet will exert its full strength to fight the enemy, and the warships currently stationed in Hawaii will sail directly to Manila, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies at the highest speed. The UK and the US have reached an understanding on the use of the Singapore naval base, which is undeniable. Judging from the development of the situation from Japan, a war between the US and Japan is almost inevitable, but the US does not hope for war, but is not afraid to fight Japan. America's traditional policy in the Far East is to maintain China's territorial integrity, open door policy, and equal opportunities. If Japan can adjust its relations with the US under these conditions, there is a great chance of success. Lies, deception, and intimidation are all in vain. However, the US does not want to go to war with Japan, but when necessary, the US will use its well-prepared strength to compete with Japan.

Japan Is Clearly Still Intimidating, From the Current Signs, Although Hitler Hopes That Japan Will Fight the US, in Fact, Why Is Japan Willing to "Show Its Cards" With the US? Japan Is Still Intimidating, Only the Degree of Intimidation Is More Serious Than Before. But Will the US Succumb to Japan's Intimidation? The Facts Speak Louder Than Words. America's Measures in the Short Term Can Be a Powerful Counter-Response, Which Will Be Witnessed by the People of Shanghai, the People of China, and the People of the World. The Recall of Colonel Baker, Commander of the US 4th Marine Regiment in This Port, Is Not Actually a Shocking Thing, but the Facts Behind This Fact Must Be Paid Attention To. The Relationship Between the Navy Department and the Pacific War Is Extremely Important, and Recruiting a Garrison Commander Familiar With the Shanghai Situation Back to the Navy Department Means That the Strengthening of the Department's Mechanism Is Intentional, So the Navy Authorities' Determination to Respond to Changes Can Be Clearly Seen.

Assisting China in Restraining Japan Is An Unshirkable Responsibility

The history of the world will soon have an unprecedented great transformation. America is an important role, because America has already suffered threats from both the East and the West, and America must bear full responsibility for resolving these threats. In Europe, assist the UK in restraining Germany and Italy, and in Asia, assist China in restraining Japan. The future Pacific War is not only a war confined to a corner of the Pacific, but a vast war for the entire world. America is well aware that its allies are China and the UK, and its enemies are the Axis. Therefore, in addition to being a member of the war with all its strength, it will also pay full attention to assisting China and the UK and weakening the Axis. Because China, the UK, and the US have formed a strong fortress in today's war, and this fortress is the only foundation of the new world and the new culture.

### Cholera Found on Japanese Ship Sumiyoshimaru

According to shipping industry news, one person was found to have contracted cholera on the Japanese ship Sumiyoshimaru, which recently entered Kaohsiung Port in Taiwan from Hong Kong, and died the same day. After examination, it was determined to be cholera. At the same time, another male on the ship was also found to have the same type of disease.

### Copper Blocks from Central Mint Were Moved Away by Japanese Yesterday, Loaded onto Thirty Trucks and Returned More Than Ten Times, Worth About 40 Million

The Western-style house at 1877 Avenue Joffre (west of Rue Pere Robert), French Concession, was rented by the Shanghai Mint of the National Government as a temporary office after the August 13th Shanghai War. All the large quantities of copper coins and blocks in the factory were moved to the house for storage. Around July or August last year, the office was moved elsewhere, leaving only two or three people to guard the goods. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, the Japanese sent a large number of people in cars to the French Concession Police to request that detectives be dispatched to search the house at that number. At 6:10, detectives were dispatched to the house with the Japanese personnel and four freight trucks brought by the Japanese. After knocking on the door and entering, they thoroughly searched each room before moving all the copper coins and blocks onto the trucks and taking them away. Thirty trucks were loaded and returned more than ten times before the transportation was completed. It is said that all the copper blocks moved away were worth more than 40 million yuan.

### Sufficient Reserves of Necessities, Shanghai People Do Not Need to Worry, Large Quantities of Goods Are on Their Way to Shanghai, Alers Writes That Supply Is Not Lacking

Famous economic commentator Alers published an article in the English-language Da Mei Evening News yesterday, discussing the issue of the source of necessities in Shanghai, believing that there are sufficient reserves of various necessities and that Shanghai people do not need to worry. The original text is roughly as follows: We do not need to feel panic about the import of daily necessities in the near future. It is not yet known whether the city will be able to continue to import such goods from overseas as in the past, but we should know that Shanghai currently has quite a lot of important imported goods in storage, and a large quantity of goods is on their way to Shanghai. Therefore, in the next few months, there will be no danger of a shortage of goods here, and there is no need to worry about it. The author believes that the supply problem in Shanghai will not reach an extremely serious situation in the second half of the year.

Sufficient Rice and Coal Reserves

Shanghai has a small amount of wheat and flour, but the most important rice has extremely sufficient reserves, which can supply until June and July with ease. As for Shanghai's fuel problem, Shanghai currently has a large amount of coal in storage, which is enough for Shanghai for several months. In addition, summer is coming soon, and the amount of coal used for water heaters and other household coal will be greatly reduced, so the situation will improve in the short term. Another optimistic phenomenon is that the major factories in Shanghai have a considerable amount of coal in storage.

More Cotton Yarn Reserves Than Before

Cotton is the most important raw material in the city's industry, and the city currently has a very large amount of cotton in storage. The cotton stored in Shanghai's large and small yarn factories is more than during peacetime. Furthermore, a large amount of cotton is being shipped from India, Brazil, and other places. As for cotton yarn, Shanghai currently has about 325,000 bales of cotton yarn, and this number is increasing. Therefore, the textile industry is not at all panicked about the future situation.

Ship Problem More Important

In the first year of the Sino-Japanese War, foreign goods came to Shanghai in a steady stream. Foreign countries were able to supply as much as Shanghai needed, and there were many ships and the freight rates were very low. At that time, the problem was how to obtain foreign exchange. The current situation is the opposite. Due to the strength of the legal tender, it is not difficult to obtain foreign exchange. The problem is the ships. If there are many ships, then the necessities in Shanghai will not be a problem. For example, Shanghai has ordered a large amount of Australian wheat from Australia in the past few months, but it has not been able to be shipped to Shanghai due to the lack of ships. Otherwise, Shanghai's flour problem can also be slightly eased.

Restricting Electricity Use Is Logical

Although Shanghai's necessities will not be a problem in the near future, it is always better to prepare for a rainy day than to dig a well when you are thirsty. If we can take preventive measures in advance, the impact we will suffer in the future can also be reduced. Among Shanghai's main necessities, the source of coal is more problematic, and the Shanghai Electric Power Company is the largest user of coal, so it is most logical to first implement restrictions.

Flour Sold at a Low Price Will Start Today

Fuxin Flour will resume selling at a low price, starting today. The factory currently has 250,000 bags of flour, and the selling price is 25.3 yuan per bag. The 3 yuan is specifically for the commission of the sellers. The factory will resume the original number of 5,873 bags sold per day, except for Wednesdays and Sundays, until all 250,000 bags are sold. According to reports, Fuxin Powder Factory once suspended this work due to a lack of raw materials and worker disputes.

### Commemorating the Death of the Premier, Practicing Donation

The day after tomorrow (12th) is the 16th anniversary of the death of the Premier. People from all walks of life will solemnly commemorate the Premier's noble character and great achievements at that time, and will lower the flag to half-mast and stop entertainment activities to express their condolences. All institutions, public organizations, and schools will be closed as usual. Due to Shanghai's special environment, tree planting ceremonies cannot be held. However, the citizens of the city will unanimously practice donation of funds to meet the needs of the war effort, and to fulfill the national responsibility during the war. The authorities of the two concessions, being aware that the situation is unstable, are deeply afraid that unscrupulous elements will take the opportunity to cause trouble. It is decided to implement a joint alert for one day to prevent this.

### American Engineer Invents New Weapon for China, Manufacturing Materials Can Be Supplied by China, Plan Submitted to Government by American Ambassador

The English-language Da Mei Evening News said that an American engineer, who lived in Shanghai for ten years, is now living in Chicago. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the engineer has been very concerned about the Chinese war situation. He has carefully studied a new type of weapon specially applicable to the Chinese war, which can be manufactured by China itself using readily available materials at a low cost and with simple manufacturing. It is very suitable for fighting on Chinese soil.

Small Tank at Low Cost

This weapon is an improved small tank, only two feet high, six feet wide, and nine feet long. The maximum speed is 80 miles per hour. The cost is only a quarter of the current cheapest tank. The parts for the car can be easily replenished even in the Chinese mainland, and many of the imported materials by "Free China" that are used for other purposes can also be used to manufacture this car without difficulty.

Self-Manufacturing and Mass Production

The tank only needs two crew members, lying flat inside, so that the car will not be detected by the air, and the enemy's flat-firing guns will not be able to bombard it. This car can be driven by alcohol, which is abundant in Free China. The factory only needs 20 workers, and after a month of trial manufacturing, it can produce five vehicles a day. Since the factory area is small, it can be moved frequently to avoid bombing. The engineer has sent the plan to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for submission to the Chinese government.

### Two Hundred American Women and Children to Retreat Tomorrow, President Pierce Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

Regarding the evacuation of American expatriates in Shanghai, since the American authorities have repeatedly advised them, it is reported that there are about 200 people who are scheduled to return to the country on the American President Lines' President Pierce. Most of them are women and children, and the rest are still waiting to see how the situation develops before deciding what to do. The President Pierce arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong at 9:30 a.m. on the 9th and docked at Pier 1213. Some passengers disembarked in Shanghai, while other passengers were prohibited from landing. The ship is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for 37 hours and return to the United States via Kobe and Yokohama at 10:30 p.m. on the 11th.

### Male and Female Travelers Were Kidnapped Inside the Wengzhou Hotel Last Night, Arrested That Night Upon Arrival at Hotel in Morning, Visiting Friend Also Taken Away

In the Wengzhou Hotel at No. 70, Lane 589, Route Lafayette (i.e. Lafayette Fang), French Concession, a kidnapping occurred suddenly at 9 p.m. the night before last. At that time, one young traveler and one woman were suddenly kidnapped. At about 9 a.m. yesterday morning, one person who went to the hotel to visit was also taken away. The details of what was learned are recorded below:

Man and Woman Arrive Together, Renting One Room

Several months ago, a man claiming to be Yue Zeming, about 30 years old, speaking with a northern accent, rented Room 23 in the hotel. He was very secretive about his comings and goings. The day before yesterday (8th), a man in a suit named Yang Chunyuan (some say Yang Huiming), about 20 years old, speaking with a Yangzhou accent, also went to the hotel to open a room. The tea boy led him to Room 25, which was next to Room 23. In the afternoon, he suddenly came with a young girl and went in. In the evening, they went to the water and then, at about 7 o'clock, ordered food and ate, talking and laughing happily.

Next Door Traveler, Informs

Yue Zeming, a traveler in the next room, happened to have two men from a certain country arrive at his residence, one in a suit and the other in Chinese clothes. The one in the suit was wearing a pistol. After arriving, he monitored the cashier. Yue and the other man then went to the telephone room. After finishing the call, they returned to Room 23. At that time, it was about 7:25. Suddenly, four black-plated cars came and stopped quietly in front of the hotel.

Two People Kidnapped and Driven West

More than 20 people in miscellaneous clothes from a certain country got out of the cars. Half of them guarded the surroundings, and the other half broke into the hotel and went straight to Room 25. After a thorough search, which lasted more than 20 minutes, they took Yang and his girlfriend into the car and drove away quickly to the west, disappearing without a trace. Yue Zeming also left after the incident.

Visiting Friend Also Kidnapped

At 9 a.m. yesterday morning, a man surnamed Li went to Room 25 of the hotel to visit a friend, and was also detained by the people from a certain country who were staying in the room. However, it is not known whether the man surnamed Li was Yang's friend or had other relationships. It was not until after 5 p.m. yesterday that the man surnamed Li was also kidnapped. The reason for the kidnapping of this one person is difficult to ascertain for the time being.

### Mantingfang Robbery Case, Three Thieves Apprehended

In the Guangdong Road Mantingfang, No. 38-40 Xishanglin, a double-fronted building, the shop of a certain timber merchant, at about 5 p.m. yesterday, five bandits suddenly broke into the shop. Three of the thieves took out guns to intimidate, not allowing anyone to make a sound. A huge amount of property was robbed. Later, the shop's gatekeeper saw them, immediately drew his gun and fired two shots into the sky. The thieves heard the gunfire, knew that things were not good, and hurriedly took the stolen goods and rushed out the door to escape. Unexpectedly, at this time, the police also received an alarm and sent detectives to arrest them outside. Three thieves were arrested on the spot, and two pistols were found. They were taken to the police station for investigation. The remaining bandits escaped without a trace.

### Ding Zhonghu's Speech, Hygiene is Common to All Five Religions, A Record of the 10th Lecture of the Rongwu Society

The 10th lecture of the Rongwu Lecture Society, Ding Zhonghu spoke on hygiene as common to all five religions. The main points are: The most important health and longevity method in life is divided into five categories: 1. Breathe more clean air. The windows of the house should be opened day and night, and it is advisable to do deep breathing outdoors; 2. Get more sunlight. It is advisable to sunbathe outdoors; 3. Exercise more, but exercise should not be strenuous, and it is best to walk more every day; 4. Eat more fruits and vegetables. It is advisable to eat six walnuts, ten oranges, apples, bananas, etc., and eat spinach, cabbage, green vegetables, sweet potatoes, and potatoes every day, add half a pound of milk, two eggs, and porridge, etc. All food should be chewed carefully before swallowing. The above four methods all belong to the scientific health method. If one person concentrates on practicing these four methods, but is worried, angry, and scolds others all day long, then the body must not be healthy. This fifth kind of mental health method is indispensable.

The mental health method should first be optimistic in everything, and it is best to laugh loudly every day. In addition to being optimistic, one should also be understanding in everything. The Buddhist saying is the most accurate for what is meant by understanding, saying that all conditioned dharmas, such as fame, wealth, land, property, and family members, are like performing a play. Although they are outwardly gorgeous and solemn, and at their peak for a time, they will soon disappear and turn into nothing. Therefore, when rich and noble, in addition to clothing, food, housing, and education, one should use the surplus to help society and do all kinds of things that benefit people, and not privately for one's own family, so that one's children and grandchildren will suffer from too much wealth and will not be able to make progress. This is what is meant by understanding. If one can be understanding, then everything is optimistic. Then, combined with science, the above four kinds of health methods, then the method is complete and flawless.

Christian View of Life

Quan Youzhu Kuangming, a lawyer, spoke on the Christian view of life, saying: The foundation of Christianity is built on life. Here are the main points: 1. The meaning of life. We get rid of bad habits and evil nature, and through sorrow and repentance, we break free from this old life that belongs to the flesh, and produce a new spiritual life. The new life is immortal, because the God we believe in is self-existent, eternally existent, and eternally living. Since we have a share in God's eternal life, and have spiritual communication and connection with God, we can naturally have the same substance as God's life and be immortal with it. Recognize that the destruction of the physical body is only a segment of the life process and not the end. After death, continue to step towards an endless future.

2. The source of life comes from God's great love, because God is the origin of all life in life, which comes from God. Because the ancestors of mankind, Adam and Eve, committed a crime, the communication between man and God was cut off by sin, and they lost communication and connection with the Lord of Life, and thus fell into death. God, out of love, became flesh and was named Jesus to save the people from the sea of sin, to show the people the lost way, and to proclaim the truth of life. Every word and deed is full of authority and divinity, fully demonstrating God's love and power. He also shed his blood for the world, atoned for the sins of the world, and carried out his feat of redeeming the world to the highest peak, and even resurrected and ascended to heaven, broke out of the encirclement from the darkness, destroyed Satan and the final fortress of death, and opened the way of life. From the fresh blood of Jesus, an unlimited amount of life poured out.

3. The acquisition of life. Christ's source of life is Jun Sheng, because our original life, from Adam, has a rational nature. Now Jesus has solved the problem of sin for us, and we must accept this truth of salvation through faith, open the door of our hearts, and the life of God will enter our hearts and produce a new life. The new life is the life obtained by rebirth. In short, life contains endless treasures. If we can recognize life and receive life, we can grasp the whole of life and live a victorious life.

### Shen Meili Accused of Fraud, Cried in Court About Her Life Experience

Once Had a Love Affair and Cohabitated with a Cotton Mill Owner, After Moving to Shanghai, She Was Not Tolerated by the First Wife

Ye Qide, a cotton mill owner from Ningbo, owner of Dalong Cotton Mill at No. 8, Lane 563, Connaught Road, was working at the Central Bank of Hong Kong when he had a love affair and cohabited with Shen Meili, also known as Pu Aoshuang (currently 26 years old), a woman from Nanxiang. In July last year, he took the woman from Kunming, Ningbo, and other places to Shanghai and lived at a certain number in Caojiadu, keeping her hidden. Last winter, the woman and Ye Qide were threatened and abused by his first wife,

Separated in December 31st of last year, Ye reported to the Gordon Road Police, accusing Shen Meili of taking a car to take him to the Six Nations Hotel on Haig Road, where she colluded with Ye Pei, who was on the run, and a number of thugs, who took out pistols and threatened him, extorting 10,000 yuan in national currency unsuccessfully. He ordered Zhang Fangdao, a tea boy at the hotel from Haimen, and others to move cotton fabrics and shirts worth 5,000 yuan from the Dalong Factory. The police sent detectives to arrest Zhang Fangdao and sent him to the First Special District Court for questioning. Shen was also detained in the woman's prison while listening in the courtroom, and was once on trial with Zhang. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened the third criminal court for trial. The police first listened to Jiang Baolian's statement of the case and filed a public prosecution on charges of intimidation and fraud, stating that the fugitive Ye Pei was unable to be arrested during the change of term. Ye Qide said that he had divorced his wife because of Shen, pointing out that she was a dancer in Hong Kong and then cohabited with her, and stated the details. The defendant Zhang Fangdao pleaded that he had nothing to do with moving goods from the Dalong Factory, and denied participating in helping Shen to intimidate and extort money, and asked for forgiveness. When questioned, Shen Meili burst into tears, crying and said that she was a widow who was seduced and lost her virginity by Ye Qide, and followed him to Hong Kong, Kunming, Ningbo, and other places. Last autumn, she came to Shanghai and lived in his home in Caojiadu, where she was beaten, resulting in a miscarriage of a month-old pregnancy. She was cheated out of 12,000 yuan in national currency. The Dalong Factory was opened with her capital. After speaking, she cried loudly, cursing Ye for being heartless. As a result, under the defense of her defense lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, Judge Jiang still ordered her to be taken back into custody and scheduled the verdict.

### Western Police Forfeit Yesterday, Eastern China Wins Reserve Group Championship

In the last match of the Western Union Football Reserve Group, Eastern China was to play against the Western Police. The match was originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon at Lu Lane, the outcome of the match, while inconsequential for the Western Police, was crucial for Eastern China in determining whether they would win the championship. Currently, the Portuguese Business Reserve Group, with a record of five wins and two draws in seven matches, had an advantage of point over Eastern China, while Eastern China only had eleven points. Unexpectedly, the Western Police did not show up yesterday, disappointing six to seven thousand spectators. Until the statutory time had passed, there was no sign of the Western Police. The referee, He Chunhui, then announced the Western Police's forfeiture. Eastern China thus gained four points without effort in two consecutive weeks, winning six matches, drawing one, and totaling thirteen points in seven matches, surpassing the Portuguese Business Group with twelve points, and winning the championship of this year's Reserve Group League. The Reserve Group League schedule has now been completed. Last year's Reserve Group Championship was won by the Keers team.

### North West Children Win the Sco Tor Cup Yesterday, Defeating St. Francis 4-3

The Sco Tor Cup final between North West Children and St. Francis was held yesterday afternoon at the Racecourse.

Even green journalist passes and yellow photographer passes were among those rejected, making it impossible to obtain detailed information about the match. It is only known that North West Children defeated St. Francis 4-3 to win this year's Sco Tor Cup championship.

(Chongqing News) In order to encourage teachers in public and private schools at all levels in various provinces and cities, the Ministry of Education has formulated regulations for rewarding teachers for their service. It has also instructed the education departments of each province to investigate and report the names, ages, and other information of teachers at all levels who have served continuously in one school for ten, fifteen, or twenty years or more, in order to verify and issue award certificates. The reports from Hubei and Yunnan provinces have now been submitted to the Ministry.

### Chen Bingquan and Others Initiate Hong Kong and Macau Overseas Chinese Calligraphy Competition

(Hong Kong News) Years ago, the Ministry of Education ordered all schools to emphasize calligraphy, but many who implemented this were only doing so superficially, and the results were not significant. The situation is even more backward in Hong Kong and Macau. Recently, Chen Bingquan, Chen Gongzhe, and others in Guangzhou initiated the organization of a calligraphy competition for overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Macau in order to promote calligraphy and reverse this declining trend. They received the support of famous calligraphers residing in Hong Kong, such as Xu Shiying, Zheng Hongnian, Qu Jiangong, Deng Erding, Xie Xi, and Li Xiangen. The competition was established immediately, inviting Chen Lifu to be the honorary president, and preparations began.

### Huda Professor Zhang Guang and Others Establish Yongda Tannery

(Chenxi News) Zhang Guang, a professor of chemical engineering at National Hunan University, and others, established the Yongda Tannery in Tanwan Sanjiatang, Chenxi County, due to the abundance of leather raw materials in western Hunan. Mr. Zeng Shaoxing was appointed to manage the factory, and many technicians were hired, with experts providing guidance. The factory uses scientific principles and new methods to manufacture various types of leather. It began operations on New Year's Day, temporarily producing chrome-tanned grain leather, synthetic rubber sole leather, deerskin, and military leather. They have also found many native plant tannin specimens. Once quantitative analysis yields good results, they will be used in large quantities.

### The Story of Mr. Zhu Xiaoqin, the Founder of the Jia Lin Scholarship

Mr. Zhu Xiaoqin of Shanghai is diligent in business and has achieved remarkable results. He is very frugal in his personal life but enjoys doing good deeds. In memory of his deceased son, Jia Lin, he established a scholarship, which has been ongoing for seven years. Many poor students have benefited from it, and its contribution to society is significant. Therefore, we record Mr. Zhu's "Preface to the Students of the Jia Lin Scholarship" and "Autobiography at Fifty" below:

Preface to the Students of the Jia Lin Scholarship

In the summer of the twenty-fifth year, I established a scholarship in Haining to provide loans to those in the same county who could not afford to attend school. I used the name of my deceased son, Jia Lin, because he died during his school years. In that year, due to the war, I moved to Shanghai and no longer limited the scholarship to those from Haining. As of today, dozens of students have benefited, but I am unable to expand the number due to limited resources, which I regret in my heart. The establishment of the Jia Lin Scholarship was not intended to stop with these students, and I am now fifty years old. People typically live to sixty years. If heaven grants my wish, I will continue this endeavor until I am sixty. However, if I gain only dozens of students in five years, then in another decade, I will have only a little over a hundred students. There is a constant need for education for the children of the world, and I don't know how many there are. What help can my small contribution be? I observe farmers who have lost their husbands. They plant their fields, gaining ten from one, a thousand from a hundred, and generations multiply, covering the fields with abundant crops. In the beginning, they only planted a handful of seeds. I, like that farmer, am foolish in that I want to use the students as seeds, so that they will not only repay their loans after they have completed their studies, but also contribute from their surplus to help others, generation after generation, continuously and without end. Would the students consider my intention to be good? The task is arduous and the road is long, and it must be entrusted to the right people. All of you students have come from a rigorous selection process and are the elite of your time. What doubt do I have? The future impact will be a hundred times greater than it is today. If you students can persevere in your studies, sharpen your ambitions, not be discouraged by the passage of time, not be afraid of difficulties, remember it without forgetting, and act without ceasing, then what is there to worry about? As for those who waste time, indulge themselves, and abandon their ambitions, lacking the ability to stand on their own, how can they help others? I know that you students will never come to this. I urge you students to strive on!

What I entrust to you students is this, and what you students repay me is also this. Then, other students will also be the masters of the Jia Lin Scholarship, and they will help other students. Isn't that wonderful? In the past, when the Old Man of Yugong moved mountains, the wise man laughed at him. Will you students emulate the foolishness of Yugong or the wisdom of the wise man?

### The Current State of Domestic Public Debt in Our Country

— Li Deming

A Review of Domestic Debt Issuance Before "August 13th"

Domestic debt in our country originated in the Jiawu Year of the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, with the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government urgently needed funds and raised funds from the people, totaling 11,020,000 taels of silver, at which point it stopped. However, because it did not yet have the form of public debt, it could not be considered purely domestic debt. By the 24th year of the Guangxu reign, the Sino-Japanese War had ended, and the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, stipulating an indemnity of 100 million taels of silver. According to the treaty, the first installment of 50 million taels was to be paid within six months, and the second installment was to be paid within one year after the treaty was ratified. The remaining amount was to be amortized over six years with an annual interest rate of 5%. If the entire amount could be paid off within three years, the interest could be waived altogether. The Qing government tried every means to raise funds, initially planning to seek loans from abroad, but the terms were too harsh. Subsequently, in that year, it issued "Zhaoxin Stocks," which marked the beginning of domestic debt issuance in China. The fixed amount was 100 million taels, but due to the lack of public awareness and the Qing government's lack of credibility with the people, the amount raised was less than 5 million taels. At the end of the Xuantong reign, the revolution broke out, and the Qing government's treasury was empty. It then issued 30 million yuan of 5% Patriotic Public Bonds to meet urgent needs, but few people subscribed. Although forced fundraising was later carried out in provinces such as Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan, the total amount raised, including subscriptions from various princes and high-ranking officials, was only 1,646,790 yuan. Since the change of dynasty, natural disasters have occurred frequently, and internal wars have been incessant. The national finances have been exceptionally depleted. The government has thus regarded the issuance of public debt as the only way to provide emergency relief and financial support. This can be described in three periods:

(1) From the Founding of the Republic to 1921: During this period, the domestic debt issued by the Ministry of Finance of the former Beijing government included the following eight types (in thousands of yuan):

Among the above-mentioned domestic debts, except for the 3rd Year Domestic Public Bonds, the 4th Year Domestic Public Bonds, and the 7th Year Short-Term Public Bonds, which had definite guarantee funds, the rest were completely unsecured. Later, the Ministry of Finance of the Beijing government adopted the suggestions of domestic financiers and implemented the consolidation of domestic debt. On the one hand, it allocated funds to repay the 3rd Year, 4th Year, and 7th Year Short-Term Public Bonds. On the other hand, it converted the domestic debt issued in the 1st Year and 8th Year of the Republic at 40% of their face value in May and June of 1921, respectively, into Consolidated 6% Bonds amounting to 54,392,228 yuan and Consolidated 7% Bonds amounting to 13,600,000 yuan. For the remaining debts, the terms for repayment of principal were determined appropriately and strictly implemented. This was the first consolidation of domestic public debt in our country.

(2) From 1921 to 1932: During this period, in addition to the Consolidated 6%, Consolidated 7%, and 7th Year 6% bonds that had not yet been fully repaid after the first domestic debt consolidation, the former Ministry of Finance of the Beijing government and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government successively issued as many as 25 types. A list is shown below (in thousands of yuan):

From the establishment of the National Government in 1927 until February 1932, the principal and interest of the above-mentioned bonds were repaid on schedule. As a result, securities trading on the stock exchange was extremely developed, almost becoming the investment center of the country. After "September 18th" (the Mukden Incident), tax revenue decreased, and the bond market declined. By the time of the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident in 1932, the government's finances became even more difficult. At this time, rumors arose, claiming that the government would soon suspend the payment of principal and interest on bonds. As a result, liquidity in the bond market declined rapidly. Fortunately, the holders of various domestic bonds were deeply aware of the importance of the situation and voluntarily sacrificed their own interests to cooperate with the government. Thus, the extension and interest reduction measures of February 24, 1932, were realized. This was the second consolidation of domestic debt in our country.

(3) From 1932 to the "August 13th" Incident: During this period, the National Government conducted the third consolidation of Chinese domestic debt in February 1936. From February 1932 until the eve of the third consolidation, the domestic bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance included the following ten types (in thousands of yuan):

As of the end of January 1936, the Ministry of Finance's domestic debt obligations, excluding the 17th Year Rehabilitation Short-Term Bonds (which were about to mature), the Long-Term Financial Public Bonds (which had very long repayment terms), and the Haihe Public Bonds (which had separately secured funds), consisted of 21 types of domestic bonds that had not yet matured. Adding the above-mentioned 12 types of bonds issued successively from January 1932 to January 1936 (the guarantee funds for the Yuping Road Public Bonds and the 24th Year Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds were paid from local tax revenues in Shanxi, which are not included here), there were as many as 33 types, with a total debt of 1,460 million yuan and monthly principal and interest payments amounting to 15 million yuan. On February 1, 1936, all were consolidated into 1,460 million yuan of Unified Public Bonds. The original bond names ceased to exist from then on. The main points of the issuance of the Unified Public Bonds, as stated in the regulations, are listed below:

1.  The total amount of the Unified Public Bonds was 1,460 million yuan, to be exchanged for existing bond certificates of various types according to the length of their original maturity periods, as follows:

Unified Series A: Exchanged for six types, including the 22nd Year Patriotic Treasury Bills, totaling 150 million yuan.

Unified Series B: Exchanged for five types, including the 19th Year Rehabilitation Treasury Bills, totaling 150 million yuan.

Unified Series C: Exchanged for nine types, including the 18th Year Deficit Treasury Bills, totaling 150 million yuan.

Unified Series D: Exchanged for eight types, including the 19th Year Customs Revenue Public Bonds, totaling 550 million yuan.

Unified Series E: Exchanged for five types, including the 23rd Year Consolidated Tax Treasury Bills, totaling 260 million yuan.

2.  The interest rate was uniformly changed to 6%.

3.  The repayment terms were 12 years for Series A, 5 years for Series B, 18 years for Series C, 21 years for Series D, and 24 years for Series E. Principal would be repaid by lottery every six months in each series.

4.  The principal and interest repayment funds for the Unified Public Bonds would still be allocated from customs revenue, as originally stipulated for the existing bonds.

This time, the Ministry of Finance issued Unified Public Bonds to exchange for old debts, saving approximately 85 million yuan in debt expenses each year. This great measure can be considered the most memorable page in the history of public debt in our country! From then until the "August 13th" Incident, the domestic debts that our country continued to issue, which were issued by the Ministry of Finance and secured by consolidated taxes, included the 340 million yuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds of March 1, 1936; the 15 million yuan Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds of April 1, 1936, secured by the salt tax of Sichuan Province; and the 11 million yuan Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bonds of October 1, 1936.

### Seen, Heard, Thought

In the past, when the situation became tense, it was rare to see advertisements for the sale, rental, or transfer of real estate in the newspapers. Now, the situation is even more tense, but these types of advertisements have suddenly increased. This change indicates the future of real estate and, at the same time, the future of Shanghai.

Someone would rather sell several bags of rice to a certain party every month at the purchase price in order to obtain the possibility of hoarding rice in Pudong. If you say he is devoid of conscience, he will laugh at your naiveté. This newspaper pointed out very early that the rice weevils in the concession area were colluding with a certain party outside the concession area, working together to manipulate the rice price in this city.

As the clamor for a thorough investigation of the rice in the warehouses grew louder, the news "leaked" that most of the rice was hoarded in Pudong. It is a fact that some of it is hoarded in Pudong, but the intention of revealing this information at this time is to make people believe in the difficulty of "being unable to carry out a rice inventory investigation" and to dismiss the unanimous public opinion demanding a "thorough investigation of the rice in the warehouses."

New Domestic Debt Issued by Our Country After "August 13th"

Since the outbreak of the Lugou Bridge Incident, the expenditure on war expenses has been extremely high! The funds needed for national construction are extremely large. The largest sources of tax revenue in our country on a normal day are customs, salt, and consolidated taxes, but at this time, they have successively fallen into enemy hands. The government has issued seven types of domestic public bonds successively, and the people of the whole country, having a sense of obligation to contribute money and effort, are happy to subscribe and enthusiastically contribute. The contents of these seven types of domestic public bonds are:

(1) National Salvation Public Bonds: Issued on September 1, 1937, at 100% of face value, with a total amount of 500 million national currency units. The annual interest rate is 4%, to be paid once a year at the end of August starting in 1938. Repayment of principal will begin in 1941 and will be repaid over 30 years, with one lottery drawing each year to repay principal. The guarantee fund will be allocated from national treasury revenue.

(2) 1937 Guangxi Financial Consolidation Public Bonds: The total amount of this public bond is 17 million yuan, issued by the Ministry of Finance in December 1937. An annual allocation of 1.2 million yuan from Guangxi Province's salt tax will be used as a guarantee fund.

(3) 1938 National Defense Public Bonds: The fixed amount is 500 million yuan, issued on May 1, 1938, at 100% of face value, with an annual interest rate of 6%. Starting from May 1, 1939, payments will be made annually, with lottery drawings for repayment of principal twice a year, on October 31 and April 30, until all principal is repaid by April 3, 1969. All funds for the repayment of principal and interest will be secured by all income tax revenue.

(4) 1938 Disaster Relief Public Bonds, First Tranche: The fixed amount is 30 million national currency units, issued on July 1, 1938, at 98% of face value, with an annual interest rate of 4%. Starting from July 1, 1939, payments of principal and interest will be made twice a year until all principal is repaid by June 30, 1961. The payment fund will be guaranteed by the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund, and the principal repayment fund will be allocated from national treasury revenue.

(5) 1939 Construction Public Bonds: The fixed amount is 600 million yuan, to be issued in two tranches, with 300 million yuan issued on April 1 and August 1, respectively. The interest rate is 6%, and the term is 25 years. The surplus profits from various state-owned enterprises that have already been established or are newly established, as well as special construction funds levied under the salt tax, are designated as the fund for repayment of principal and interest. If these are insufficient, the national treasury will allocate funds to cover the shortfall.

(6) 1939 Military Supplies Public Bonds: The total amount is 600 million yuan, with 300 million yuan issued on June 1 and October 1, 1939, respectively. The annual interest rate is 6%. For the first two years from the date of issuance, only interest will be paid. After two years, principal and interest will be repaid twice a year until all principal is repaid by the end of May and September 1966, respectively. The fund will be secured by consolidated taxes and taxes on tobacco and alcohol.

(7) 1940 Military Supplies Public Bonds: The total amount is 1,200 million yuan, with 600 million yuan issued on March 1 and September 1, 1940, respectively. The annual interest rate is 6%. For the first two years from the date of issuance, only interest will be paid. Repayment of principal will begin in 1943 and will be amortized over 25 years, with lottery drawings for repayment of principal every six months. The fund will be allocated from national treasury revenue.

As of today, the total amount of various domestic public bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance with definite guarantees, including the old debts from before "August 13th," is 18 types. Among them, 13 types are directly secured by the central government's revenue, and the other 5 types are secured by the revenue of various provinces. The current outstanding balances of each bond are listed in the following table (in thousands of yuan):

(A) Secured by Central Government Revenue:

(B) Secured by Local Government Revenue:

The Rise and Fall of Domestic Debt Prices

Since the implementation of the extension and interest reduction measures in 1932, the funds for our domestic public debt have been uniformly covered by customs revenue. Each month, the Inspector General of Customs allocates funds to the National Debt Fund Management Committee for deposit and payment. Since then, even though the central government's finances have been in an extremely difficult period, the repayment of principal and interest on domestic debt has never been delayed, so its creditworthiness has increased day by day. In June 1937, the price of the five types of Unified Public Bonds reached the highest record since the opening of trading, filling the future of securities trading in our country with optimistic air. But since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the bond market has been showing signs of instability. In early August, in order to prevent speculators from manipulating the market, the government specifically set minimum prices for the five types of Unified Public Bonds, with Series A at 76 yuan, Series B at 73.5 yuan, Series C at 71.5 yuan, and Series D and E each at 70 yuan. Later, with the start of the Shanghai Battle, the stock exchange was ordered to close, but the price in over-the-counter trading had already shown a downward trend. But later, due to the consolidation of our country's wartime finance and the government's efforts to maintain unwavering creditworthiness, coupled with the improvement of the war situation and the expansion of international aid to China, the over-the-counter price gradually rebounded after reaching its lowest record in January 1938. Although there have been fluctuations from time to time, the general trend has indeed been gradually improving. As of today, the price of the Unified Bonds has not only exceeded the specified limit price, but is also not far from the highest record before the war! Now, let us take Unified Series A as an example to record the rise and fall of its market price since January 1938. As for the rise and fall of the prices of the other four types, it is not difficult for us to infer from this one example.

Conclusion

When any modern country encounters war with foreign countries, the methods of raising war funds in a hurry are nothing more than borrowing, inflating the currency, increasing taxes, and issuing public debt. Based on China's national conditions and the precedents of various countries, issuing public debt is the most appropriate method. In order to make it easier to absorb, our government has not made large-scale issuances, and it uses a system of solicitation and free purchase, in order to ensure that the use of social funds is not affected by it. In total, in the four years of war, the total amount of the seven types of domestic debt issued by our country is only 3,447 million yuan. Adding the 100 million units of Customs Gold Bonds, 10 million pounds of British Gold Bonds, 50 million dollars of US Gold Bonds in the 1938 Gold Public Bonds, and 10 million pounds of British Gold Bonds, 50 million dollars of US Gold Bonds in the 1940 Construction Gold Public Bonds, compared with Japan's 26 billion public debt, this number is not too much. Is this not an important reason why our country's finance has always been able to remain in a consolidated state since the war began?

### Potatoes (Continued)

— Gao Jiannong

To be honest, potatoes have been transformed from wild to domesticated plants in Chile and Peru for at least two thousand years. However, if it weren't for the promotion by the Spanish, it might still be confined to a narrow area in the Andes Mountains, never seen by the world! The Spanish first brought it to their country along with sweet potatoes, but because the Iberian Peninsula also has a subtropical climate, sweet potatoes immediately had the opportunity to develop, thrive, and flourish as if they were at home, which also aroused the love of Spanish farmers. Potatoes, on the other hand, were in a lower position and were a bit frustrated. Even now, Spanish farmers only plant potatoes occasionally, with a bit of a "presenting new offerings" feeling. Later, the Spanish sent potatoes as "staple food" to Mexico and northern America to supply the people who were developing colonies. That was great! The potato finally found its place and encountered a suitable environment! Especially in what is now the state of Virginia, the famous British explorer Drake discovered it in the area and brought it back to Great Britain in 1586. Later, Walter Raleigh followed closely, – the famous figure who flattered Queen Elizabeth by spreading his long coat on the muddy water to allow her to walk across it! – also transported potatoes from Virginia to his homeland. Therefore, around 1600 AD, potatoes were already strangely admired and appreciated by the English and Irish! Later, a botanist named John Gerarde promoted and publicized potatoes and also tried to plant them near London. As a result, potatoes gradually became popular throughout England. Soon, parts of Germany and eastern France also had traces of potatoes. As for the Italian Peninsula, due to the relationship between Spain and the Roman Court, which worshiped the old religion, priests carried and offered them, so they also obtained potato seeds from another route.

However, in the early 17th century, potatoes were mostly used as feed for livestock, and their use as food for humans was met with extremely strong opposition. This was actually because most of the tuberous plants similar to them contained the most violent toxins. Take France, for example. King Louis XIII was willing to spread potatoes widely among the people. In 1616, he set an example by using them as imperial meals. King Louis XIV also had them as a daily staple, but it didn't have much effect at all. It was a pharmacist and agricultural economist named Parmentier who used a little trick to spread the word about potatoes! It turned out that Parmentier was the most enthusiastic advocate of this precious plant. In 1771, the research institute in the Besangon region of eastern France offered a reward for "plants that could replace food in lean years" because of the famine. Parmentier's dissertation recommending potatoes was selected. In 1778, he also published his book on the chemical examination of potatoes. But it wasn't until 1785 that he received the support of King Louis XVI and the Royal Agricultural Society to plant his beloved plant on a plain called Sablons in northern Paris. When the potatoes were about to ripen, Parmentier deliberately asked the king to send a team of soldiers to guard the field. As soon as the news spread, everyone was stirred: What precious things are they that are worth the king using troops to protect? So, the more they were forbidden, the more they wanted to get their hands on them. Some people sneaked into the area at night to dig them up, but the soldiers deliberately pretended to be deaf and dumb, letting them carry them away. After everyone tried them, they found that they were not only non-toxic but also very delicious, so potatoes quickly became popular among the entire population.

Now everyone knows how important potatoes are in the food of Europeans and Americans! Just take the island of Ireland as an example: Potatoes are almost the only food for the residents. Therefore, around 1846 AD, Ireland suffered from a potato famine, and thousands of people starved to death, and more than one million people left their hometowns and fled to foreign lands! No wonder the English botanist Gerarde, the hero who spread potatoes, wanted people to carve his portrait holding a potato flower to show his achievements!

It is not yet certain when potatoes were introduced into China. I think it was after the opening of the five treaty ports, when priests or merchants occasionally brought them here. However, potatoes in China are indeed very suitable for the local soil and climate, and there will definitely be unlimited development in the future. We still need to increase our promotion and popularization efforts!

### Corn

— Qiu Lang

Rice prices are rising day by day, and families in the middle and lower classes are sighing over having to count the grains of rice to cook! However, people cannot live without food for a day. Since rice prices have risen, they can only eat other foods to fill their stomachs, such as flour and miscellaneous grains. However, flour is also expensive. A relatively cheaper option is corn, which can be mixed with other foods to save a lot of money on expenses. I very much agree with the text in the economic news in this newspaper, such as "Unable to Afford Rice, Switching to Corn."

Corn is also called "baogu," "yushushu," and "lusu." In Shanghai, it is called "zhenzhu mi" (pearl rice). According to the "Shu Shu" section of the "Compendium of Materia Medica," "Shu Shu (sorghum) was first planted in Shu, hence the name Shu Shu. Taste: sweet, astringent, warm, non-toxic. Main treatment: warms the middle, astringes the intestines and stomach, stops cholera, etc. It is now planted in the north to prepare for grain shortages and to feed cattle and horses. The tallest variety is called 'lu qie' by southerners. It is suitable to be sown in the spring and harvested in the autumn. The stems are about ten feet high and resemble reeds but are solid inside. The leaves also resemble reed catkins, large like belts. The grains are as large as peppercorns and are red and black. The rice is firm and solid. There are two types, yellow and red. The sticky ones can be mixed with glutinous rice to brew wine and make bait. The non-sticky ones can be made into cakes and cooked into porridge, which can relieve famine, raise livestock, and be used as brooms. The stems can be woven into mats and fences and used for cooking, which is most beneficial to the people." The "Yu Shu Shu" section says, "Yu Shu Shu (corn) originated in the West. Its seedlings and leaves are similar to Shu Shu but are fat and short. They are also similar to Job's tears. The seedlings are three to four feet high and flower in June or July, forming ears like husked wheat. A pod grows separately from the center of the seedling, like a fish's shape. White whiskers hang down from the pod. After a long time, the pod splits open and the kernels come out, clustered together... Taste: sweet, neutral, non-toxic. Main treatment: regulates the middle and opens the stomach. The roots and leaves, when boiled into juice and drunk, relieve frequent and difficult urination. When burned into ashes and taken with wine, it is effective in treating difficult childbirth," and so on. From this, we can see that corn can relieve famine, as evidenced by previous statements, and it is also very beneficial to the body. The so-called "Shu Shu" and "Yu Shu Shu," according to the "Compendium of Materia Medica," are probably "ben lusu" (native sorghum) and "yang xi su" (foreign millet). Some people also call it "six grains." There is a saying, "After eating five grains, you want six grains," to compare the insufficiency of the human heart. The name "pearl rice" is the most elegant and is also true to its name, because as reported, corn is now as expensive as pearls. In these years, it is indeed difficult to live because rice is as expensive as pearls and firewood as expensive as cassia! As for how to eat it, grinding it into flour and cooking it into porridge with vegetable hearts is very palatable. Please buy it and try it.

### The Colors of Clothes

— Si

The colors of clothes have a close relationship with women. Every young girl often says, "What color suits me best?" So I will talk about the characteristics of various colors.

Red – Red is the most exciting color. It can express a lively psychology. Not only does the person wearing it feel refreshed, but the person looking at it also feels excited. Every woman can wear red, unless you are neurasthenic or the color does not harmonize with your skin tone.

Green – Green represents youth, peace, and freedom. Grass green is a symbol of fresh air outdoors. A woman who often works in an office can wear a grass-green dress to regulate her spirits. It is also very suitable to wear at home.

Yellow – Yellow is the color that children love the most. Therefore, when a woman wears yellow clothes, in addition to expressing her youthful beauty, she can also arouse children's goodwill.

Black – Black can show a dignified appearance. Wearing black clothes is very generous, but it is not very suitable for tall, thin, and dark-skinned women.

Brown – Brown can also express a leisurely outdoor atmosphere. It is especially suitable for women under the age of twenty-five, but a solid brown color is very monotonous, so you must have yellow or orange-yellow accents.

### Proclamation to Unscrupulous Second Landlords of the Isolated Island

— Sun Choucheng

Shanghai's prosperity leads the nation, where land is truly worth its weight in gold, hence the high cost of rent surpasses other places. There has long been lament about the difficulty of living in Shanghai. Since the National Army retreated westward two years ago, turning the area into an isolated island, compatriots from the occupied territories with some financial means have flocked to the concessions to seek refuge. Consequently, rents have become even more exorbitant. Most first landlords are reasonable and their rent increases are limited. However, second landlords are the most detestable, driven by insatiable greed. Before renting, they impose all sorts of conditions: families with children are rejected for being troublesome, large families are rejected for being too crowded, and those without guarantors are rejected out of fear of unpaid rent. Other demands include wanting tips or requiring advance payments, the list of outrageous demands is endless. After renting, they impose all sorts of restrictions: regulations on the minimum brightness of light bulbs, prohibition of turning them on early or off late, and prohibition of cooking outdoors due to the foul smell of coal stoves. Even a tiny attic room or lean-to can cost twenty or thirty yuan in rent, with constant attempts to raise it. Therefore, ordinary middle-class refugees pay dozens of yuan in rent for a dwelling where they eat, sleep, and relieve themselves. Besides a bed, a table, cooking utensils, and a chamber pot, there is no room to move. Their hardship is beyond words. My friend, Mr. Yuan Jianmei, since his hometown of Pinghu fell, moved to Shanghai with his family and has already suffered such hardship. Yesterday, when discussing this, he sighed repeatedly and composed twelve seven-character quatrains, vividly detailing his personal suffering without omission. They are transcribed below, hoping that second landlords, after reading them, will be moved by conscience and show some consideration for third-party tenants:

(1) Obtaining good land, yearly rent is insufficient,
How can the harvest compare to the second landlord's gains?
The people suffer greatly, displaced and impoverished,
Relying on buildings to generate wealth, uniquely different.

(2) Barely escaped the dust of calamity to a celestial harbor,
A haven by the sea, a good place to avoid Qin.
Don't say it's not easy to live in Chang'an,
Every inch of land is worth its weight in gold in Spring Shen.

(3) Renting a house, mostly to escape disaster,
Looking back, our former home is already ashes.
A shoulder pole of luggage, three or two people,
Crying is forbidden, especially if bringing children.

(4) Many people, few houses, it's a favorable situation to seize,
Once the tenant leaves, the price increases again.
Before the previous tenant moves out, the next one arrives,
See who is quick and ascends first.

(5) Morning and evening indistinguishable, crowded and cramped,
Confined and restricted, we temporarily lodge here.
Besides setting up a bed and cooking utensils,
Even a screen or a small table is hard to accommodate.

(6) Borrowing a small space under the eaves,
Thirty yuan is the asking price, no bargaining.
If rent payment is even three days late,
The order to evict is issued with an authoritative voice.

(7) Electric lights are only allowed nine candlepower,
Strict rules for turning them off early or on late.
Who is responsible for the leaking roof flooding the bed?
The cost of hiring workers to repair it is borne by the tenant.

(8) Burning firewood is not allowed, causing smoke,
Move the cooking stove outside.
If a guest stays overnight,
The fine for violating the quota is three thousand.

(9) Taking advantage of burning to loot, as the saying goes,
More greedy and evil than a cunning merchant by tenfold.
Not allowing a single inch of leeway,
A fellow countryman, ashamed to live among them.

(10) Renting other people's houses, farming other people's fields,
Though the harvest is plentiful, how many years can one enjoy it?
When peace returns to the Central Plains one day,
Who will care, who will pity?

(11) Landlords are mostly generous,
Rent increases are still averaging at ten percent.
Rice and coal subsidies are jointly contested and helped,
Who can reason with the extortionate rent?

(12) Walking long distances in the summer heat, resting in deep forests,
Heaven allows travelers to borrow green shade.
Impartial in providing shelter, regardless of status,
Even allowing birds to roost until dawn.

### Insights on Infant Care

— Fu

Nursing an infant can be said to be an easy task, but it can also be said to be a difficult one. If the infant's mother has milk and is willing to breastfeed, then naturally there is no problem. However, if she does not have milk, or if she has milk but is not willing to breastfeed exclusively, then it is not an easy matter to resolve. Employing a wet nurse requires attention to her milk quantity and quality, as well as her physical condition and temperament, as these are all extremely important for the infant's health. Furthermore, even if all of the above are not problems, the wet nurse's level of knowledge is generally shallow, and she is even more ignorant of infant care methods, sometimes even smothering the infant to death. Isn't this very dangerous? Since hiring a wet nurse is not a good solution, one can only resort to milk substitutes. However, there are a bewildering variety of milk substitutes, and imported products are too expensive. Choosing one is also a troublesome task. According to my family's experience, the domestic product "Anjian'er Pure Lipid Milk Powder" is of excellent quality and has the same effect as breast milk. It is very convenient to prepare and drink, leaves no sediment, and is very affordable. All the infants in my family have been fed with Anjian'er milk powder, and they are all lively and healthy, which is a joy to behold. For families with infants, why not give it a try?

### A Week's Worth of Home-Style Meal Plans

— Ms. Hua Ying

Among the vegetables these days, rapeseed is the most delicious, both sweet and tender, costing eight cents per pound, which is relatively inexpensive. Therefore, almost every day we have rapeseed on our dining table, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. For non-vegetarian dishes, we like to stir-fry it with sliced meat, adding bamboo shoot slices and shredded ham. With green, white, and red colors, it looks very appetizing when served. In addition, stir-fried beef slices or stir-fried shrimp, with a little water chestnut flour, are very flavorful. For vegetarian dishes, simple stir-frying is the most common. Sometimes, when the old lady eats vegetarian, we add bamboo shoot slices and shiitake mushroom slices to make her very satisfied.

### Journey Through Zhejiang and Shanghai

— Paul

Since the coastal ports were blockaded, today the only way to travel between Zhejiang and Shanghai is through the port of Shipu. A guest who came from Yongkang described the hardships along the way. Here is a summary to help those traveling to the interior.

Day 1: From Yongkang to Xikou: There is a direct bus from Jinhua to Xikou that passes through Yongkang. The fare from Yongkang to Xikou is 35 yuan per person, but the tickets are difficult to obtain.

Day 2: From Xikou to Ningbo: In the morning, hire sedan chairs to depart from Xikou, costing 7 yuan per item. Arrive at Jiangkou at noon. After lunch, hire a foot-rowed boat, costing 10 yuan per boat. Entering the river from the sea requires passing a dam, where a long chain is used to pull the boat up, which is extremely dangerous. Arrive in Ningbo in the evening. Stay at the Anping Hotel, costing 2 yuan per day. However, meals are extraordinarily expensive, with one serving of plain rice costing 1.30 yuan.

Day 3: Inquire about the route to Shipu and stay in Ningbo.

Day 4: Hire a small boat and depart at 10 PM. Arrive in Hengxi the next morning. The boat is incredibly filthy, full of bugs and fleas.

Day 5: From Hengxi to Xizhou: In the morning, hire rickshaws from Hengxi, costing 10 yuan per rickshaw. Travel for five hours to Xianghe Tan for lunch. Switch to a small sailboat to cross Xiangshan Port. The boat fare is 3 to 4 yuan per person. Arrive in Xizhou after four hours and stay overnight at the Changyu Hotel.

Day 6: From Xizhou to Shipu: The distance is 120 li. Hire sedan chairs in the morning, costing 30 yuan per ride. Pass over nine mountain ridges, among which the Eight Ridges and Three Ridges are the most dangerous. It is said that bandits often appear. Arrive in Shipu at night and stay at the New Asia Hotel, costing 3 yuan per person per day. Meals are outside, costing 3 yuan per person per meal.

Days 7 to 10: Stay in Shipu waiting for the boat.

Day 10: Board the Gaodeng ship at night. Cabin class is 50 yuan per person, medium bunk is 15 yuan per person, and small bunk is 4 to 5 yuan. Meals are provided on the ship, but they are unpalatable. The ship travels for over 30 hours and stops outside Wusong Port.

Days 13 to 18: The ship stops outside the port for sulfur fumigation to prevent plague. Every morning, customs officials board the ship to inspect. If there are any deaths, the ship will be detained for 40 days before being allowed to enter the port.

Day 18: Enter the port at night. At 10:15, the ship docks at the Astronomical Observatory Pier, and we are finally able to disembark.

Spring and Autumn

### Superficiality

— Juehui

Speaking human language to humans, speaking ghost language to ghosts: being flowery and flattering to good people, being humble and subservient to bad people... although the methods vary in subtlety, they are all forms of superficiality.

Superficiality can be big or small, but it remains superficiality.

Meeting an acquaintance on the street, "The weather is really nice today, hahaha..." This is small superficiality, which doesn't matter much.

A poor person is starving to death, and the "head of the family" strolls out, "Don't worry, I will find a way to lower the rice price." The tone is quite "solemn."

Turning his head, a "big belly" one hand holding a "ticket" and the other holding a "knife"... "Of course, of course! If we don't hoard at this time, when will we? Hahaha..."

This is, however, big superficiality. Not only "matters a lot," but also tens of thousands (probably more) statements of death!

Superficiality, "hahaha," only makes the "unscrupulous" even more "unrestrained"!

### "Amahs"

— Zhong Zimang

After Mrs. Pan watched the "amah" leave with her blue floral cloth bag, she immediately retracted that ferocious, angry expression; but her eyebrows were still knitted together.

Mrs. Pan deeply felt that she lacked strategies for dealing with "amahs." The New Year's bonus was so much, and she still complained it was too little. She had barely completed a "hao tou" (a fixed term of employment) when she abruptly announced, like a "lightning strike," that she had received a letter from her hometown and needed to go back to farm. Mrs. Pan was truly caught between laughter and tears and couldn't help but vent her anger, scolding her fiercely with glaring eyes. But the "amah" always maintained a slight smile and eventually left, which made Mrs. Pan a little heartbroken. Moreover, she had to start looking for an "amah" again—a very difficult task that always gave Mrs. Pan a headache.

Mrs. Pan was good at using the abacus, so she cooked dinner herself and instructed Boss Zhang of the employment agency to send an "amah" the next day.

The next morning, an "amah" was brought by Boss Zhang. Mrs. Pan sized up the new maid from head to toe. She had an oval face, her hair was slicked back, and she wore a new-ish, navy-blue cheongsam over black wool crepe silk pants. This made Mrs. Pan's anger rise three zhang (about ten meters): "More beautiful than the mistress! Ugh, even wears rouge! Humph!" She wanted to refuse her outright, but Boss Zhang had already said, "Try her out." Mrs. Pan thought that the toilets hadn't been emptied yet, and having a beautiful maid could also enhance the mistress's prestige, so she might as well give it a try.

This fashionable "amah" was very obedient on the first day, following orders without question. What pleased Mrs. Pan was that she ate very little, only two small bowls of rice. As for the dishes—one bite of vegetables for every three bites of rice—she perfectly met Mrs. Pan's standard for choosing an "amah." Mrs. Pan had a trick: it didn't matter if the salary was a little higher, as long as the "amah" ate less rice, preferably with a vegetarian's piety. Then, the amount of rice saved would be significant, and she wouldn't have to worry about her stealing food.

However, reality differed greatly from the ideal. The new "amah" asked for leave to go out on the second night. Mrs. Pan was extremely suspicious, feeling like several coal briquettes were missing from the brazier. However, Mrs. Pan was patient. But on the third day, the "amah" upstairs secretly told Mrs. Pan that the "amah" had won money playing mahjong and was saying bad things about the "mistress," complaining that the dishes were bad, always just a bowl of soybean sprouts or vegetables.

Of course, without any "approvals," Mrs. Pan immediately issued an order, spent a few cents to send the new maid away.

Mrs. Pan decided to start with "country goods," as they were more honest than "old Shanghai," easier to control, and easier to restrain.

So, Boss Zhang sent another "authentic" country woman who had "just arrived in Shanghai yesterday."

She was a woman with a sallow complexion, a loud voice, a patched cotton-padded jacket, and a blue square patch on the heel of her cloth socks—in short, a middle-aged country woman who didn't understand the term "amah" and had simply come to the city to earn a living.

She certainly worked sincerely. Mrs. Pan seized the opportunity to put the heavy work on this "amah's" shoulders: after mopping the floor, she had to wash two quilts. However, she ate three large bowls of rice, no less. After eating, she would start working again without saying a word, completely displaying her simple and honest nature.

When Mrs. Pan lifted the rice pot, she knew that the "standard" had been "breached"—Mrs. Pan seemed to see a bottomless pit and was startled. Not only did she not have a stomach illness, not only was she not vegetarian, but she ate so much! Three big bowls of rice—the more Mrs. Pan thought about it, the more she thought it was unworthy.

Mrs. Pan suddenly told the country woman to leave, quickly, to avoid eating another dinner.

The country woman, in pain and confusion, dragged her weary steps and walked away, dejectedly.

Mrs. Pan angrily slumped onto the faded sofa cushion. She was also quite tired, troubled by the search for a loyal, hardworking, and light-eating "amah" who would work like a "beast of burden"...

### Random Jottings

— Wenqiang

(1) The Long Snake Formation

Every morning, when I walk past the intersection of Tongfu Road and Weihaiwei Road, I see countless common citizens standing in front of a Taoist association's door, lined up in a long snake formation, waiting to buy inexpensive state rice. I want to tell people, and keep telling people (until the long snake formation disappears), that the long snake formation here is growing longer every day! Now that the price of state rice has raced past one hundred yuan, the long snake formation will inevitably break all previous records!

### "One Ounce of Gold, Four Ounces of Luck"

— Weiyang

In this modern age of flourishing science, logically, those who believe in fate should have disappeared. But in fact, it is not the case. Not only do the Buddha-chanting old women in remote villages still believe that "this life's suffering is due to a lack of cultivation in the previous life," but even the adults and gentlemen in large cities believe that fate has its place. Otherwise, the maintenance of social order would be even more difficult. In their minds, "fate" is used to supplement the inadequacies of the military police and laws.

So, missionaries have work to do, and fortune tellers don't have to worry about going hungry. As for those who toil all day but can't get enough to eat, what else can they say but blame their bad fate?

Do you envy people who live in foreign-style houses and drive cars? "One ounce of gold, four ounces of luck; see if you, a ragged and penniless wretch, have that kind of luck!"

People with luck can be recognized at a glance. The big-bellied wealthy merchants and the round-faced rich old men are the most obvious symbols. Do you have this fortunate appearance?

Yesterday, the manager said, "Those who sit facing outwards must have luck!"

Do you have this luck?

If you have none of these, then even if you suffer for a lifetime, you can't blame others. Because one ounce of gold has to be exchanged for four ounces of luck, isn't that clear enough?

But I always doubt this saying, because besides "appearance," there is also "conscience"!

Love—this is truly the most elusive thing in the world! Many people say that it doesn't exist at all. The so-called love between parents, siblings, and children is purely a combination of interests. Separated from interests, love absolutely will not exist between them. Furthermore, the relationship between men and women, which has always been recognized as the easiest to generate the enzymes of love, if you were to take them completely apart, then all that you could see would be nothing more than the pursuit of desire. Of course, many people disagree with such extreme arguments, because facts tell us that throughout history, no one knows how many citizens have nobly sacrificed everything for their country; how many parents have tragically sacrificed themselves for their children; how many children have bravely sacrificed all their happiness for their parents; and countless devoted men and women willingly endure all kinds of pain for another person, even depressed and haggard, dying bloody, dying shattered, dying decapitated... Isn't this not something that can be promoted by just the pursuit of interest or carnal desire! Clearly there is a kind of wonderful great power between them, what is it? Besides love, there is nothing else in the world can generate such a magic in the heat!

However, humans are too clever, gradually abusing this most precious love at will, even using it as a cover to do all sorts of things that are absolutely contrary to love. As a result, our eyes become blurred, money, vanity, and lust are all mixed together with love. Even the smartest people sometimes feel unable to distinguish, just like trying to find a hair that truly belongs to you on the floor of a barbershop.

For someone who performs in operas, love is especially a question. For them, singing operas every day, the plots of joy, sorrow, separation, and reunion, rotate through their inspiration time and time again like recycled food, finally numbing their senses. What is a fake play, what is a true story, they simply cannot distinguish. To hope for true love to grow from their hearts is almost as difficult as hoping for rice to grow in a stone field. Even if they happen to develop a genuine love for someone exceptionally, people won't believe them, because their expressions on stage are too good. Once they are off stage, no matter how enthusiastic they are, they won't be better than they are on stage, and people will always consider it as a false gesture!
