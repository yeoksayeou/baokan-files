### Anglo-American Agreement on Cooperation Plan: Rapid Developments Expected in the Current Situation; Possibility of the Two Nations’ Accord Becoming an Alliance; British Government Announces Ban on Commodity Exports to Japan

United Press, London, 15th – Britain today anticipates rapid developments in Anglo-American cooperation regarding the war. Diplomatic and political commentators state that, as naval and air force leaders of both Britain and the United States were present during the meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill, the outcome of this meeting may lead to active US participation in the war. It is believed that the separate meetings of the British and American naval, land, and air force leaders are equivalent to staff consultations, and it is believed that they focused on the war in the Atlantic and Japan. A diplomatic correspondent for the "Daily Telegraph" stated, "A consensus on unified action that the two nations can take in these two important areas has clearly been reached."

United Press, Washington, 15th – Observers here today stated that the consultation between Churchill and President Roosevelt, as well as their talks with British and American military leaders, will inevitably lead the United States to further concentrate its military strength to support Britain and the Soviet Union. However, they indicated that this assistance would not reach the level of actual combat. Although this important meeting of Anglo-American leaders is not enough in itself to bring the United States closer to actual war, the decisions taken at this meeting will result in closer cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the actual effect will be to increase the United States' involvement in the outcome of the war. Responsible parties declared that President Roosevelt has created an Anglo-American accord, which could be a prelude to a future military alliance. The eight-point program for post-war peace goals reflects the attitude of the US government and serves as the basis for the accord, which can be developed into a formal alliance when international crises require it.

Reuters, Washington, 15th – The general sentiment in Washington today is that Britain and the United States will soon take decisive parallel measures to implement the policies agreed upon at the maritime conference between Churchill and Roosevelt. Well-informed diplomatic sources here believe that the outcome of this meeting will far exceed a joint declaration stating peaceful aims. Some officials believe that President Roosevelt may continue to announce details of the maritime conference in a fireside chat.

Reuters, New York, 15th – The American sentiment reflected in newspapers and radio currently increasingly believes that the scope of the talks between the US President and the British Prime Minister extends far beyond war aims. Many editorial writers and radio commentators point out that this declaration has little meaning without planned actions to back it up, so they all expect action. The interventionist faction in the United States now expects action to follow words, while the isolationist faction darkly hints at the secret role the US President is now undertaking.

Reuters, New York, 15th – "The New York Times" editorial today stated that the era of American isolation is now over, and the era in which the United States assumes responsibility in this world war has now begun. This Anglo-American joint declaration will guide the efforts of Britain and the United States and measure their progress until the war ends and peace is established.

Reuters, London, 15th – The British government has announced new economic actions against Japan. The Board of Trade has issued an order, effective August 15th, prohibiting all exports to Japan, including Karafuto Island, Korea, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, and Manchuria, all under Japanese administration, except for those with a license from the Board of Trade. Export licenses previously issued for shipment to the above-mentioned areas are now all canceled.

United Press, London, 15th – It is widely believed that this measure by the British government is the first strong action following the Anglo-American meeting. Observers say that this move is to demonstrate to Japan that Britain and the United States are determined to maintain the status quo in the Far East. This move also indicates that Britain and the United States will take even tougher measures if necessary to prevent further aggression that directly affects the interests of Britain and the United States.

Reuters, Tokyo, 15th – The British Board of Trade's recent prohibition of certain goods to Japan has not caused a reaction from the Japanese, because trade between Britain and Japan has virtually stopped since the outbreak of the war. It is generally believed that the new ban has very little impact on Japan.

### Amau Succeeds Ohashi as Japanese Vice Foreign Minister

United Press, Tokyo, 15th – Officials have announced that former Ambassador to Italy, Eiji Amau, has been appointed as Vice Foreign Minister to replace Ohashi.

Reuters, London, 15th – An observer familiar with Far Eastern affairs commented on Amau's appointment as Japanese Vice Foreign Minister, saying that given the criticism from some extreme pro-Axis newspapers in Japan of Foreign Minister Toyoda and their urging to appoint someone who thoroughly understands how to implement Japan's determined policies as Vice Foreign Minister, Amau's appointment is particularly noteworthy. This is because Amau has long been considered to be in the faction of Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, who is recognized by both Japanese and foreigners as a more cautious figure who does not favor continued adventurism.

### Large Number of Australian Reinforcements Arrive in Singapore to Strengthen Defenses

United Press, Singapore, 15th – Officials have announced that a strong Australian military force has arrived in Singapore to strengthen defenses. This reinforcement includes various units, including airmen, which will further strengthen the defense of Malaya. The arrival of a large number of Australian troops to reinforce defenses demonstrates that Australia is determined to assist Malaya in deterring aggression in the South Pacific. Authoritative sources have also stated that the number of Australian troops arriving to reinforce defenses is extremely large, the largest military force ever seen arriving in Malaya to reinforce defenses. This is the third batch of British troops to arrive here in two weeks. The troops include infantry, artillery, service corps, engineering corps, and field ambulance units. Although the troops coming here also carry equipment, most of the equipment, such as Bren guns, anti-tank guns, and motorized transport vehicles, has already arrived in advance. The British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, Brooke-Popham, and the Commander of the Australian forces in Malaya, Bennett, both delivered speeches welcoming the newly arrived Australian troops.

Reuters, Singapore, 15th – The arrival of fresh Australian troops today is seen by the local population as a symbol of Australia's determination to make Singapore its first line of defense. It also indicates that Britain, Australia, and their allies in the Pacific are now adopting an unyielding policy to resist any country's attempt to interfere with the freedom of the people in this region. The tens of thousands of British, Australian, and Indian troops currently stationed in Malaya are the best barrier against any further aggression. The welcome of the Australian troops by the people of Malaya today is due to the feeling that the region is now safer than ever.

Reuters, Melbourne, 15th – The Military Advisory Committee met all day but did not issue a formal statement. It is reported that the committee thoroughly discussed the overall situation in the Far East and other international issues. It is believed that the issue of Menzies going to London was also mentioned, but it was felt that the issue should be decided by Parliament. The War Cabinet and the full Cabinet will meet in Sydney on Tuesday.

### US Far East Army Commander Urges Soldiers to Serve With Dedication

United Press, Manila, 15th – US Far East Army Commander Lieutenant General MacArthur, speaking at a ceremony held at Zablan Airfield today, welcomed the Philippine Air Force to join the US Army. MacArthur said, "I welcome this group of excellent young men to serve in the US Army. You are now part of the Far East Army. I believe in your responsibility if war comes." Unofficial estimates put the number of personnel in the Philippine Air Force incorporated into the US Army at approximately 100 flight officers and 500 soldiers.

### First US Oil Tanker Leaves US for Vladivostok; Carries 95,000 Gallons of Aviation Fuel; Dutch East Indies Goods Diverted to Soviet Union

United Press, Washington, 15th – Officials announced yesterday that the first oil tanker carrying aviation fuel to the Soviet Union, flying the US flag, left Los Angeles for Vladivostok yesterday. This is one of four oil tankers carrying oil to the Soviet Union, carrying a total of 95,000 gallons of aviation fuel.

Havas, London, 14th – The British Broadcasting Corporation recently broadcast a message stating that, according to the Dutch government, goods originally intended for shipment to Japan have now been retained for diversion to the Soviet Union. Several Soviet ships are already fully loaded with these goods and have sailed back to the port of Vladivostok.

### Thailand Eager to Maintain Peace; US Minister to Thailand Replaced; Japanese and Thai Envoys Promoted

United Press, Bangkok, 15th – The parliament passed a government emergency bill at dusk yesterday, establishing a Ministry of Transportation. The bill was passed in one session. At the same time, according to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it denied that the US Minister to Thailand, Grant, had suggested using American military aid to change Thailand's pro-Japanese policy. The statement said, "There is no factual basis for such suggestions. Thailand's policy is to be friends with everyone." It also said that Grant's meeting with Prime Minister Songgram aimed to enhance the friendship between the two countries. At the same time, current affairs commentator Sanya has been continuously broadcasting a peaceful speech for three nights, based on the "spirit of the Bodhisattva," saying that the government intends to make peaceful proposals to all relevant countries.

Reuters, Washington, 15th – President Roosevelt has appointed Peck, Counselor of the US Embassy in Peiping, as the US Minister to Thailand.

Reuters, Tokyo, 15th – The Information Bureau announced today that the governments of Japan and Thailand have decided to upgrade their legations to embassies from August 16th in order to strengthen the close relationship between the two countries. Teiji Tsubogami, former Vice Minister of Colonial Affairs and President of the Manchurian Colonization Corporation, has been appointed as the first Ambassador to Thailand.

Editorial

### Investigation of the Living Expenses of the Salaried Class

Since the announcement of the freeze on funds, the impact on exchange rates has not been as severe as the impact on commodity prices. Commodity prices have risen suddenly like a hurricane, increasing significantly in an instant. In particular, the control of Dalian oil has been like a stroke, with the most drastic increases. Vegetables and other food items are meant to sustain human life, and trade is supposed to be free, but now even humble items such as green vegetables and bean sprouts are no different from meat in price compared to four years ago. What crime have the Chinese people committed to suffer such misery? Where are the products going, being used exclusively for "common use"? Since this "common use" circle has been imposed on the Chinese people, their lives have been subjected to the hardships of shackles and bonds, which have been increasing day by day. However, although the general public knows that the threat and pressure on life caused by this "common use" are high-handed, painful, suffocating, and groaning, there is no means to measure it, no numbers to represent it. Therefore, although its degree is profound, it is not easy to clearly understand how profound it is, and it is even more difficult to make people see at a glance that it is profound to this extent. Thus, we know that a yardstick is indispensable, just as it is indispensable to know lengths and to understand depths.

So, who is to provide this yardstick? It is the general cost-of-living index. The cost-of-living index uses numbers to indicate the level of general living expenses. What is commonly seen in newspapers is the cost-of-living index for workers. However, life cannot be treated as a single entity. The quality of enjoyment varies greatly, and the degree of sophistication is uneven. There are those who are poor enough to live on baked cakes, and there are those who are so rich that they find it difficult to swallow even the most delicious delicacies. However, those with generous incomes and high-class lifestyles can easily use their resources to hoard and speculate, even if prices are soaring; they can also take advantage of real estate to raise rents, evict tenants, and collect excessive tips. Those who open factories and stores can add everything to the price of goods and pass it on to consumers. In short, they use cunning and plunder to compensate for what they lack. Only the salaried class with fixed incomes sees prices running ahead while their lives fall behind. It is not that their income does not increase at all, but that the rate at which salaries increase is far slower than the rate at which prices rise. Therefore, if we observe from the numbers of living expenses, there is a major expansion and much progress; but if we measure from the enjoyment of life, it is deteriorating day by day, far worse than before, with much regression. This phenomenon of living contradiction is now at its peak. There is already a cost-of-living index for workers, and there is also one for Westerners, so it is not difficult to express their living conditions in numbers. Only the Chinese salaried class, which occupies the main and solid part of society, is withering and suffering under the pressure of life, without the opportunity to be seen by the public. When there is a need for a reasonable adjustment in life, they also suffer from a lack of a yardstick, taking evidence from the worker cost-of-living index. Although the situation of the salaried class and the working class is the same, with the same fixed income, the same labor compensation, and the same being employed, there may be differences in the form of their lives. There is a saying: "A long gown is the most troublesome thing." "Long gown" is a symbol of the salaried class, not that the working class does not wear long gowns. The habit of wearing this long gown adds many expenses to life, and all food, clothing, housing, and transportation are often higher than for workers, while their income may not be better than that of the wage-earning class. The burden of supporting a superficial appearance is a major burden for the salaried class. However, since they do not change their way of life and do not make a factual review, why complain and blame others? Only if the salaried class can present the outline of their living conditions in the same way will the cost-of-living index be complete.

The idea of compiling a cost-of-living index for the salaried class has been around for more than a decade. However, in terms of occupation and work, the improvement of the living conditions of workers at that time was more urgent than that of salaried workers, so the compilation of the worker cost-of-living index was given priority. The investigation of the living expenses of the salaried class has been delayed until now and has not been realized. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is conducting a survey on the living expenses of salaried employees, which is now an urgent task. To compile the cost-of-living index for a certain class, it is necessary to first understand the actual situation of living expenses of a certain class, and then know how much a certain part of the expense accounts for the entire expense, in order to calculate how the rise and fall of a certain part of the commodity price affects a certain part of their life! A household budget survey is to prepare for this work. The bookkeeping households collected now are limited to salaried families, without limiting the industry, excluding farmers, workers, and self-employed persons. Of the household heads' income, those with a monthly income of no more than 1,000 yuan account for 30%, and those with a monthly income of less than 500 yuan account for 70%, with a bias towards lower monthly incomes, which is deeply in line with the meaning of popularization. The bookkeeping period is three months, which is short and easy to complete. Given the large population of the salaried class in Shanghai, and the current difficulty of living, the pain and distress over the current inability to solve life problems, and the anxiety and worry over how to survive in the future, there is now an opportunity to contribute their actual necessary living expenses, which only takes a few minutes of recording labor, to society. This is a direct calculation for themselves and an indirect calculation for the entire salaried family. With the increase in knowledge among the salaried class in Shanghai, and the increasing number of educated housewives, household bookkeeping is not a difficult task. It can be certain that the number of families responding will be more than this number. However, the more households that keep accounts, the more precise and reliable the analysis and comparison will be. If the bookkeeping time can be appropriately extended, the more comprehensive the categories of living expenses included will be, and the closer it will be to the actual situation of life. This will ultimately depend on the thickness of the manpower and financial resources on the compilation side, and the amount of support from the salaried class's bookkeeping families. However, since the Industrial and Social Affairs Department has already taken this initiative, the completion is not far away, and we are willing to wait and see.

### Report of French Troops Opening Up the Yunnan-Guangxi Border: No Information Received by the Chinese Side; If France Assists Japan in Invading the Chinese Border, Chinese Troops Will Take Action

Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman said yesterday that four Japanese mechanized units, each carrying 150 tanks, had been transported from Japan to Manchuria, two of which had already arrived, and the remaining two were on their way. From August 18th, Chinese or foreigners will not be allowed to enter the three northeastern provinces. He also said that this area has not received reports of French troops arriving at the Yunnan-Guangxi border, but if French troops assist Japanese troops in attacking the Chinese border, Chinese troops will take action. Japanese troops in Vietnam are currently advancing south rather than north. The spokesman mentioned the battle in western Hubei, saying that Japanese troops who had invaded near Hao Xue in Yichang had been repelled, with 4,000 Japanese casualties. Chinese troops are currently attacking the Japanese bases in Shashi and other places (Reuters, 15th).

Chongqing – At a reception for foreign journalists today, Major General Bao Kai, a spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission, was asked by a reporter whether it was true that French troops had been transferred to the Yunnan-Vietnam border, as reported by the British side. Bao immediately replied that this area had not received any information to confirm this report (Havas, 14th).

Hanoi – Officials recently issued a communiqué stating, "Foreign parties, especially the British, have been spreading rumors in recent days that French troops stationed in Vietnam have concentrated near the borders of Yunnan and Guangxi provinces, covering Japanese troops invading China. The British have also issued a message from Chongqing stating that these French troops are covering the flanks of the Japanese troops. Since relations between China and France have deteriorated, this move is not surprising. It must be solemnly stated that this false report is entirely a consistent style of anti-French propaganda, fabricated out of thin air, and completely untrue" (Havas, 14th).

### Japanese Planes Attack Yunnan

Kunming – Japanese bombers attacked this area again this morning. A total of nine Japanese planes came in three waves. The all-clear was given at 2:00 PM (Reuters, 15th).

Kunming – Twenty-seven Japanese planes simultaneously invaded the city this morning, dropping hundreds of bombs in the bustling area. The Southwest Associated University, the Tsinghua University office, and the Yunnan Daily News, among others, were all destroyed. Fortunately, all personnel are safe (14th dispatch).

Kunming – Kunming was subjected to its fourth consecutive day of air raids yesterday. Twenty-seven Japanese planes flew in at 10:30 AM yesterday and dropped bombs near the terminus of the Yunnan-Burma Road in the city. Shops and houses were damaged. The all-clear was given at 2:30 PM (Reuters, 15th).

Chongqing Alert – No Japanese Planes Seen

After Chongqing was bombed by Japanese planes during the day, an air raid alert was also issued at 8:10 AM this morning, but no Japanese planes were seen (United Press, 15th).

### Regulations on Examination of Prohibition of Opium and Drugs Abolished

Chongqing – The National Government issued an order on the 15th that the Regulations on Examination of Prohibition of Opium and Drugs be immediately abolished (15th dispatch).

### Since the Past Four Years, Results of the Chinese Air Force: More Than 1,500 Japanese Planes Shot Down; More Than 1,000 Japanese Air Force Personnel Killed

Chengdu – "August 14th" is the second Chinese Air Force Day. The Aviation Commission announced the results of the Chinese Air Force's battles over the past four years, totaling more than 1,500 Japanese planes shot down, 1,208 Japanese Air Force personnel killed with verifiable names, and even more without verification. However, based on reliable estimates of the number of Japanese plane losses, it should be over 4,000. 69 prisoners were captured. Among them were renowned Air Force personnel such as the "King of Fighters," the "King of Bombers," and the "Four Heavenly Kings" of the fighter squadron, all buried in the vast Chinese wilderness (13th dispatch).

People from All Walks of Life in Chongqing Commemorate Air Force Day

Chongqing – The rally to commemorate Air Force Day in the capital and the General Association for Comforting the Troops, as well as the evening party to entertain Air Force officers and soldiers, were held together on the 14th evening. Chairman Gu Zhenggang hoped that the citizens would expand the aircraft donation campaign, the national defense science campaign, and the gliding movement. The attendees responded enthusiastically on the spot and passed a telegram to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang to pay tribute to the Air Force officers and soldiers (14th dispatch).

### Anglo-American Declaration of Eight Principles Lays the Foundation for the Future of Democracy; Echoes Wilson's Fourteen Points; Those Who Use Force to Subdue Others Will Ultimately Fail

Reuters, Washington, 15th – Secretary of State Hull stated that the joint declaration by Churchill and Roosevelt is a document of basic principles and shared basic policy concepts in implementation. These principles and concepts are recognized by all civilized countries and have always been supported by the world. However, since some countries decided to launch a universal movement to destroy the structure of civilized relations between countries and establish rule by barbaric force to conquer others, these principles have been hindered and remain so to this day.

Havas, Washington, 14th – After the official release of the joint declaration by President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, the various rumors about the President's actions in recent days have finally been clarified. During the meeting between the President and Churchill, the White House and the Department of the Navy maintained strict secrecy, issuing only brief communiqués about the President's travels. Political figures here believe that this declaration was expected and does not indicate surprise. They only indicate that the eight principles listed in the declaration echo the fourteen points proposed by President Wilson during World War I. On the surface, it is a reaffirmation of the common desire to defeat Germany, but in reality, it adds some active factors to the Anglo-American cooperation. The rumors that Britain and Germany are about to sign a peace treaty can be dispelled by this declaration. In short, the specific results of this meeting will inevitably be seen in the facts one after another in the future, and it is undoubtedly certain that the two sides have decided to act in unison in Europe and the Far East, although this is not mentioned in the official communiqué. Regarding this matter, the authorities' intention is probably not to allow domestic isolationist elements to regain their strength to oppose any Anglo-American agreement, so they do not want to make the Anglo-American political connection too close to give grounds for attack. As for the nature of the cooperation between the two sides, it is not difficult to know from the participation of senior naval and land army officers of the two countries in the meeting at the same time. Moreover, after attending the meeting, British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook also accompanied US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall here to deploy everything on a resolution to supply the countries fighting against Germany with military supplies from the United States.

### Chongqing Expresses Gratification

United Press, Chongqing, 15th – The highest government officials have reserved formal criticism of the joint declaration by Roosevelt and Churchill because they have not yet received its official original text. However, they stated that they believe this meeting is extremely important and is extremely important for all of humanity in the world. As China is a member of the anti-aggression group, it has a direct and deep concern for the plans to reorganize the world in the future. An official indicated that if the disarmament of the Axis powers is implemented, it will result in the use of force against Japan, because Japan will certainly not be willing to be disarmed without war. Following the joint declaration was the news that Britain banned exports to Japan, which has had a very good impression on official and private circles here. Newspapers here all published the joint declaration on the front page, but because the news arrived here quite late, they have not yet commented on it. A senior official told United Press that the important point is that Britain and the United States have dedicated themselves to defeating Nazi tyranny. If this matter can be completed, the problems of Japan and the Far East will be automatically solved. If Britain and the United States can shift their joint attention to this aspect, then Japan will not be able to continue its current behavior. Based on the general Chinese view, the two points that there will be no territorial changes and that the people have the right to freely choose their own government are extremely important. Qualified observers pointed out that China has repeatedly stated its war goals, including recovering all territories lost to Japan, and that Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated that if Japanese troops completely withdraw from Chinese territory, China is prepared to conclude peace.

### Pacific War Crisis Spurs Roosevelt-Churchill Meeting: Two Giants to Conduct Thorough Exploration of the Entire European and Far Eastern Situation

London, Associated Press, 15th - It is widely believed that the threat of war in the Pacific is one of the reasons for President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill's historic meeting at sea. Now that this meeting has been announced, we can declare that it was initiated by President Roosevelt. Although Mr. Hopkins traveled to the United States several times before the war to reach out to Churchill, he never met with President Roosevelt. However, when Churchill was Prime Minister, he often spoke with the President by telephone, raising numerous issues, especially regarding prompt and effective assistance to the Soviet Union. Other issues requiring exploration include the supply of American provisions to the UK and the Near East, and the transport of American-made tanks and other raw materials to the war zone. Vichy's submission to the Axis, including the fate of French Northeast Africa and the defense of the Western Hemisphere, will necessitate new policies by Britain and the United States. More distant issues, such as Germany's influence in Iran, are also attracting widespread attention. Many who were formerly apprehensive now realize for the first time that Germany can be defeated by Soviet resistance. Germany is now deploying four-fifths of its national strength to attack the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom and the United States must urgently take firm action. Reliable sources say that all of these issues are sufficient for Roosevelt and Churchill to discuss at length. If these facts are still not sufficient reason for the meeting, then Japan's disregard for the warnings of the United Kingdom and the United States is undoubtedly the direct cause of the meeting. The recent smooth progress of the British-Australian-Dutch conference necessitates that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill discuss the second phase of defense measures in the Pacific. If Britain, Australia, and the Netherlands can establish a defense alliance, the United States will endorse it. At that time, Washington may explicitly declare that the territorial integrity of the Dutch East Indies is within the scope of American security. Observers believe that President Roosevelt has thoroughly reviewed with Prime Minister Churchill the consequences that Japan's further southward advance into Thailand and its continued troop increase in Siberia would entail. They may have even received recent intelligence from London stating that Japan plans to double its current 240,000 troops stationed in Manchuria by early September. It is reported that Japan has transferred two divisions from its home country and two divisions from China to Manchuria. The Japanese army previously stationed in Manchuria already consisted of as many as sixteen divisions. It is also rumored that Tokyo plans to dispatch an additional ten to eleven divisions to Manchuria.

Enhanced Anglo-American Cooperation Greatly Excites London

London, Reuters, 15th - The Roosevelt-Churchill meeting at sea was proposed by President Roosevelt, and Churchill gladly accepted it, traveling far from his country to hold this important conversation. The Dominions were not formally consulted, so Churchill only represents the British government. Now that the joint declaration has been issued, the British are very excited. All the evening newspapers published special editions, recognizing this as evidence of the increasingly close relationship between Britain and the United States in general policy, and as a very important event in the war. The participation of land, sea, and air leaders in this meeting proves that the entire war situation has been discussed in detail, and that various issues concerning the European and Far Eastern situations have been studied in an atmosphere of complete secrecy and mutual understanding.

Ottawa, Reuters, 15th - Canadians believe that the eight war aims jointly declared by Britain and the United States represent lofty ideals, which all peace-loving people should support. The close cooperation between Britain and the United States is especially evident in this, increasing people's confidence. The statement mentions governments cooperating with Germany, naturally paying special attention to the solution to the Japanese situation. As far as is known, no Canadian officials participated in this sea meeting. Canadian Prime Minister King commented on the meeting, expressing deep satisfaction, believing that this move could make the future relationship between Britain and the United States even closer, and stating that this joint declaration is worthy of the most thorough study and will have a significant impact on world public opinion. This document expresses complete understanding and cooperation in the conduct of the war, as well as complete agreement on the ultimate goal of a peace that is victorious rather than retaliatory.

Roosevelt's Policy Unanimously Supported Across America

Washington, Reuters, 15th - Yesterday morning, people in Washington had already expected exciting developments in the situation and were not disappointed. Hundreds of millions of people across the country were listening intently to the announcement that officials had promised to issue beforehand, but soon learned that the announcer was a British spokesman in London and that what he announced was the process and important results of the important meeting between Churchill and Roosevelt at sea. At about 9 a.m., all radio stations rebroadcasted the statement made in London by British Lord President Attlee. After the rebroadcast was completed, the radio announcers told the audience that the White House had issued the same document. Some observers, upon hearing this announcement, said that this was almost the same as a joint agreement that the United States would support the war alongside Britain. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also expressed his opinion after hearing the broadcast, recognizing that this document represents general American public opinion, from which it can be seen that Congress will definitely support the President. It is widely believed that this Anglo-American declaration is an outline of the conditions for a peace treaty that the United States can support or even jointly guarantee. Observers here see the most important feature of this as preventing Hitler from launching his peace offensive in the near future and ensuring that American public opinion fully supports the government. Because there is a segment of domestic public opinion that previously questioned what the future would hold and why the Allies did not declare their peace goals, they will now recognize that this document has declared the nature of the peace treaty at this time, as any country can. As far as is known here, President Roosevelt is still at sea. This joint declaration was telegraphed to the White House for publication from a location unknown to the public. Before this declaration was issued, anxiously awaiting news reporters had gathered in the White House reception room. After the printed joint declaration was issued, the reporters rushed to grab a copy and quickly went to the telephone rooms and telegraph offices to transmit the document. At the same time, members of Congress, such as Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative May, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, also went to radio stations after listening to British Attlee's broadcast to express their satisfying opinions on this document to the people through the airwaves. The initial reactions everywhere are satisfactory. When the President returns to the capital, he will definitely receive a grand welcome. The principles that the President cherishes most, which have been repeatedly seen in the President's fireside chats since the outbreak of the European war, are now all included in this joint declaration. Items four and five embody the doctrine that President Roosevelt used to launch his new initiatives. Item six contains one of the President's most important beliefs. Item seven is the doctrine of freedom of the seas, which the President has most strongly supported and repeatedly declared as American policy when announcing the U.S. Navy and Air Force patrols of the Atlantic Ocean a few weeks ago. Item eight is perhaps the most important principle, in other words, Britain and the United States have decided that all aggressor nations, namely Germany, Italy, and Japan, must be disarmed. An important American figure told a Reuters reporter that this document is more concise than the Four Freedoms that the President announced in his fireside chat in May. Those who previously opposed the President's policies, such as Senators Austin Barkley and Johnson, and Representative Bloom, immediately issued opinions praising this document.

Situation of Sea Meeting: White House Issues Photos

Washington, Reuters, 15th - The U.S. cruiser Augusta, formerly the flagship of the U.S. fleet, which was docked in the Huangpu River during the Shanghai battles in 1937, was the location of the historically important meeting between U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill. Photos released by the White House last night showed the leaders of the two great democratic nations sitting in wicker chairs under awnings on the ship's deck, talking to each other. Assistant Secretary of State Welles and the U.S. President's two sons in military uniforms were also on board. Another photo showed participants in the meeting including Pound, a senior official from the British Admiralty, Dill, the British Chief of the General Staff, Stark and Marshall, the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations and Chief of Staff of the Army, as well as Hopkins and Harriman. King, Commander of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, also attended the meeting.

### A Glimpse of Reactions from Axis Countries

Tokyo, Reuters, 15th - The intense reactions of Japanese newspapers and semi-official sources to the Anglo-American declaration may indicate that there is still no hope of reversing the decision on Japan's future policy. The Asahi Shimbun, traditionally known for its conservatism, launched its most violent attack on democratic nations tonight. The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun also called the declaration a treacherous international conspiracy.

Berlin, Reuters, 15th - Political circles here say that the Anglo-American declaration is stale news and there is no reason to attach importance to it.

Berlin, Huitong News Agency, 15th - The Foreign Ministry said last night that Roosevelt and Churchill issued a joint declaration in the hope of salvaging their residual situation. The declaration aims to make people in the world deeply believe that Roosevelt and Churchill are both very concerned about a solemn and lasting peace plan. According to Berlin's opinion, the so-called Roosevelt and Churchill having no territorial ambitions whatsoever is actually an exposure of the ambition to make the Treaty of Versailles, which has created all the inequalities in Europe and used flesh and blood to construct the British Empire, continue to be effective.

### Beaverbrook Arrives in Washington to Discuss Arms Supply Issues

Washington, Reuters, 15th - British Minister of Supply Beaverbrook has recently arrived in Washington. Beaverbrook attended the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting and is now in Washington to discuss issues concerning the supply of arms.

Washington, Reuters, 15th - After arriving in Washington, British Minister of Supply Beaverbrook told reporters that Britain has obtained the benefit of trillions of dollars worth of value under the lease-lend program, but Britain still has many needs. Answering reporters' continuous questions, Beaverbrook said that what we need are food, tanks, and airplanes, especially bombers. We have obtained surprising results from American-made bombers. In fact, the best bombers we have come from the United States. We already have many tank divisions and tank brigades. Although we have manufactured many tanks, it is still not enough. We want to obtain tanks. Beaverbrook was unwilling to add anything to what had already been published regarding the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, nor would he say that Hopkins participated in the discussion. Beaverbrook revealed that when he was Minister of Aircraft Production, Britain received a total of 2,200 American aircraft, many of which had to be modified to install British-made machine guns. By the time he left office, 1,200 had gone to war.

### Hiranuma's Condition Unchanged, Motivation for Assassination Attributed to Nazi Conspiracy

Tokyo, Associated Press, 15th - Ishii, Deputy Spokesman of the Cabinet Information Bureau, declared today that Baron Hiranuma, who was wounded in yesterday's assassination attempt, showed no change in his condition last night. Regarding the assassination and the extent of Hiranuma's injuries, it is not yet possible to know more. The police are still investigating the circumstances of the assassination. Japanese newspapers today strongly condemned the assassination attempt on Hiranuma. The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun declared that the assassination was terrible, painful, and regrettable, and expressed the hope that Hiranuma could return to work soon and continue his efforts. The newspaper also said that in the encirclement of Britain and the United States, Japan should show a united and harmonious front. The Chugai Shimbun pointed out that since the Meiji era, there have been ten cabinet members who have been assassinated, but this is not enough to prove that Japan is an uncivilized country, but it also cannot deny that there are fanatical and impetuous people among the Japanese, whose minds are narrow and cannot understand the other side of the facts. The newspaper said that although Hiranuma had allowed the zealous to deliberate at length, he was still unavoidably attacked. The newspaper also said that zeal is enough to make the country rich and strong, but some instigators are abusing the old San Francisco wireless broadcast carried by a certain foreign news agency, saying that Hiranuma's assassination was due to his relationship with the army, which is contrary to the facts. Taipei Public News Agency, 15th, Tokyo - As of last night, the government has not yet announced anything about the condition of Hiranuma Kiichirō, Minister without Portfolio. Hiranuma was assassinated in his private residence yesterday morning. International News Service, 15th, Washington - Today, confidential Far Eastern diplomatic reports were received here stating that the attempted assassination of Japanese Minister of State Hiranuma Kiichirō was part of a German conspiracy. It is said that Germany is planning to instigate a military coup in Japan to make Japan join the war.

The Saying that Japanese Troops are Leaving Guangzhou is Inaccurate

Hong Kong: It was learned here today that the repeated reports in local Chinese newspapers that Japanese troops will withdraw from the occupied areas of Guangdong Province on October 10 have no basis. The Japanese High Command currently has no intention of withdrawing Japanese troops from the occupied areas of Guangdong Province. The Japanese side admits that about 11,000 Japanese troops have been withdrawn from the Guangzhou area to serve in Vietnam and Manchuria, but sufficient troops remain to guard all important strongholds near Guangzhou, Shantou, Kowloon, and Zhongshan. The semi-official Chongqing newspaper Ta Kung Pao recently carried news from Shaoguan stating that the Japanese women, children, and factories in Guangzhou, Shantou, and Kowloon have been ordered to evacuate immediately because the Japanese army may launch another southward advance soon, so there is fear that the aforementioned cities may be subjected to retaliatory bombings. There are only rumors that the Pearl River will be blockaded. The American ship Falun, the French ship Fashan, and the Japanese ship Shiragane Maru are still maintaining navigation between Hong Kong and Guangzhou. (National Festival Telegraph from 15th)

### Japanese Residents of Hong Kong Leave One After Another: Funds Frozen, Nothing to Do, More Than 400 People Prepare to Withdraw

Hong Kong: Japanese Consul-General Yano announced today that Japanese residents of Hong Kong will return home because commercial activities have come to a standstill due to the impact of the freeze. Yano said that 30 women and children and some men are scheduled to return to Japan today. There are still about 400 Japanese residents here who are going through the procedures of selling their businesses before returning home. (Associated Press City Telegraph from 15th)

Freezing Funds in Hong Kong Does Not Hinder Business for Chinese Merchants

Hong Kong: The Commissioner of Foreign Exchange Control in Hong Kong, Mr. De, told reporters that the freezing of Chinese funds in Hong Kong was at the request of the Chinese government, so the measures are designed to not hinder business for Chinese merchants.

### German Troops Invading Soviet Union Suffer Heavy Losses, Difficult to Realize Original Schedule, Soviets Withdraw from Two Towns on the Bug River, Report of Odessa Falling Proven Incorrect

Moscow, Reuters, 15th - The heavy price that the Germans have paid for invading the Soviet Union can be glimpsed in the numbers of German losses announced here yesterday. According to the Soviets, these numbers are not yet complete, and they include the destruction of a German tank regiment, eleven German divisions, and thirteen German regiments. Another twenty-one divisions have lost more than half their strength. The battle for Smolensk, lasting more than three weeks, which gave the Soviet army time to deploy new positions, is part of the price that Germany has paid. The casualties among the soldiers will be difficult to replenish. Hitler's original schedule was for General von Kleist's German troops to enter Leningrad on August 1, General Bock's German troops to enter Moscow, and General Rundstedt's German troops to occupy Kiev. However, it has now been delayed by two weeks and has not yet succeeded. The German troops that have been destroyed include the 39th Tank Regiment, the 8th, 18th, 16th, 19th, and 20th Tank Divisions, the 27th Mechanized Division, the 5th, 68th, 110th, and 137th Infantry Divisions, and the famous Death's Head SS Division. Among the German divisions that have lost more than half their strength are five tank divisions and five SS divisions. The trend of the Smolensk salient is that, under the current circumstances, an attack on Moscow is hopeless. Judging from the communique, in addition to attacking Ukraine, the German army has resumed its offensive in the northwest in the past two days in an attempt to seize the famous swamp of Staraya Russa south of Lake Ilmen. This move by the German army is intended to cut off the railway traffic between Leningrad and Moscow sixty miles southeast of Staraya Russa. However, the terrain there is difficult and will be impassable for weeks, so if the German army does not win immediately, it will be in a predicament.

London, Reuters, 15th - Soviet Foreign Minister and Deputy Director of the Information Bureau Lozovsky yesterday denied the German claim that they had occupied Odessa, saying, "This is just wishful thinking." Lozovsky also denied that the Southern Soviet Army had been surrounded. German propaganda is now loudly proclaiming that the German army and its allies have gained advantages in Ukraine. The German official news agency broadcast the news that the Soviet army was making a similar Dunkirk-like withdrawal in the Black Sea. Yesterday's Soviet communique only stated that nothing significant had happened on the lines on Wednesday. The German command boasted, "The Soviet defenses in the Ukrainian heartland are nearing complete collapse under the pressure of the continuous pursuit of the German, Hungarian, and Italian troops." It also said, "Odessa has been surrounded, Nikolaev (seventy miles northeast of Odessa) has been attacked from the east and west, and the large Soviet force west of the Bug River will be annihilated. German mobile units are advancing towards the lower reaches of the Dnieper River and have occupied the Krivoy Rog iron sand area, which produces 19 million tons of iron sand annually, so the Soviets have lost more than 61 percent of their iron production quota and have suffered extremely serious military and economic blows." Furthermore, the German official news agency claimed that the Soviet forces in Odessa and Nikolaev are withdrawing towards the Black Sea. The troop transports carrying Soviet soldiers were fiercely attacked by the German air force, and the German navy also participated in the battle, dispatching large numbers of warships to fight in the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Arctic Ocean, and has blockaded the Soviet northern port of Arkhangelsk. According to news from Stockholm, the Swedish correspondent in Berlin reported that in the Odessa and Ochakov areas along the Black Sea coast, the Soviet army has been surrounded on land and is preparing to retreat from the sea to Crimea and the Caucasus. The German army may have suffered heavy losses in weakening the resistance of the surrounded Soviet army in other areas, so it hopes to destroy them without engaging in costly battles when the Soviet army boards ships to evacuate. The Swedish correspondent also reported that the Germans claimed that the crossings on the Dnieper River were destroyed one by one by German aircraft, and the railway to Leningrad was cut off in several places by German aircraft. The German army is now being transferred east from the Smolensk area and is launching a major attack in the southern area of the vast front in an attempt to seize valuable resources and the oil fields of the Caucasus. The Soviet Information Bureau issued a communique as follows: On August 14, the Soviet army fought the enemy along the entire line from the White Sea to the Black Sea. The Southern Soviet Army has withdrawn from the towns of Kirovograd and Pervomaisk (on the Bug River northwest of Nikolaev). The Soviet Air Force, in cooperation with the Army, continued to strike the enemy and destroyed enemy aircraft on the airfields. On the 13th, the Soviet Air Force destroyed 74 enemy aircraft in aerial combat and bombing enemy airfields. The Soviet also lost 27 aircraft. The Baltic Fleet sank a submarine.

Helsinki, Associated Press, 15th - The official communique said yesterday that the enemy forces on Lake Ladoga are fighting fiercely under pressure from our army, and some enemy forces are even trying to withdraw from the lake.

Moscow, Associated Press, 15th - Officials announced today that no German aircraft appeared over Moscow last night. The German air force has not attacked Moscow for two consecutive nights.

### British Newspapers Comment on Soviet Withdrawal as Having Strategic Significance

London, Associated Press, 15th - Authoritative British figures recently commented on the Soviet Union's acknowledgment of its withdrawal from Kirovograd and Pervomaisk in Ukraine, saying that the Soviets have withdrawn to a line east of the Dnieper River, but the German army has not yet shown any signs of crossing any section of the Dnieper River, and stated that if the Soviets withdraw most of their southern forces to the line east of the Dnieper River, this withdrawal would be of strategic value, because the Soviet Union would also be able to build a strong defense to protect the important Donets Basin.

### Axis Powers to Hold Meeting at Month's End to Discuss the Partition of Territories

Reuters, Vienna, 15th - It has been confirmed here that Germany, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, and other countries will hold a meeting in Vienna at the end of August. The reason for convening this meeting is that various Axis powers have developed different opinions regarding Germany's "New Europe" plan, and the meeting will resolve issues of territorial distribution. (It is reported that Germany had promised the same territory to several allies, thus causing disputes.) The Turkish press believes that this meeting will inevitably fail because none of the Axis countries are willing to give up territory. As for the ownership of Bitov, Kichevo, and Gostivar, these are particularly difficult issues to resolve, as Italy and Bulgaria are both vying for these cities. In addition, the meeting will also discuss Bulgaria's participation in the war, Finland's formal accession to the Tripartite Pact, and joint actions by countries in the Tripartite Pact against the United States.

### Poland to Send Chargé d'Affaires to Moscow to Promote Diplomatic Relations

Havas, Moscow, 14th - Following the establishment of an agreement between the Soviet Union and Poland, the Polish government in London has dispatched Chargé d'Affaires Mr. Retinger to Moscow to promote diplomatic relations between the two countries. Mr. Retinger met with Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov today for discussions.

### Overseas Chinese in Malaya Launch Fundraising Campaign to Aid British Disaster Victims

Singapore, 14th - The General Association of the Nanyang Chinese Disaster Relief Fundraising Committee has decided to hold a seven-day fundraising campaign throughout Malaya to aid victims of the London Blitz, in response to the fundraising campaign led by the Mayor of London. The General Association has obtained the consent of Governor Thomas. In his reply, the Governor stated, "I believe this action by your association demonstrates the Chinese people's recognition that Britain is fighting for world freedom and that the British government is working to protect Malaya."

### New York Financial Institution Sends Personnel to the Far East

Reuters, New York, 15th - A major New York financial institution with substantial investments in the Far East has recently sent additional personnel to the Far East via Clipper. This is quite interesting and allows one to infer the trend of the Pacific crisis. The reason is that many employees and their families of the institution had recently been evacuated from the Far East, but now there is a sudden move to send personnel back, indicating a belief that Japan does not want to launch a war that would lead to its own destruction.

### President Coolidge Sends SOS Signal; News Unconfirmed

Reuters, Manila, 15th - This afternoon, rumors are rife here that the "President Coolidge," which left Shanghai yesterday carrying 250 passengers bound for the United States, sent out a distress signal. Enquiries to the American President Lines have so far been unable to confirm it. The naval authorities are also keeping silent on the matter.

### Vichy Elements in Syria Violate Armistice Treaty, Obstructing French Troops from Joining Allied Forces; British Authorities Resolve to Take Countermeasures

Reuters, Cairo, 15th - Following repeated violations of the armistice treaty by Vichy elements in Syria, it is reported that the Allied forces will now take actions they deem necessary to ensure that Vichy troops can freely choose their allegiance, as stipulated in Article 8 of the armistice treaty. The Allied Commander has had to lodge a special protest against three actions by the Vichy elements that violate the treaty: (1) Former Syrian High Commissioner General Zheng Zi denounced French soldiers willing to join the Free French forces as deserters. (2) The families and baggage of many French soldiers awaiting the opportunity to choose their allegiance have been hurriedly transported to embarkation points. (3) When the armistice treaty was signed, the Vichy authorities sold large quantities of war equipment to civilians. During the negotiations, British prisoners were even taken out of Syria, some even being handed over to Axis control. As a result, General Deng Zi and 34 Vichy officers were also detained. In addition, the obstacles imposed by the Vichy side are too numerous to mention. For example, 50 French soldiers willing to join the Free French forces were arrested by military police in Tripoli. British authorities had to arrest these military police to rescue the detained French soldiers. As of a week ago, several thousand Vichy soldiers had defected to the Allied forces, and the flow has continued unabated. On one day, 60 Vichy officers came to defect. Months ago, Vichy had specially established a headquarters for elite troops to fight the Allied forces in Syria. These troops were sent from France, but they are now gradually defecting to the Allied forces. In the coming days, thousands more Vichy soldiers will surely come to defect. At the same time, the Free French are now showing generosity to Syria. Lebanese people also have a civil aviation school in the Syrian government, and many people have enrolled for training. Syria has linked itself to the Sterling Area to facilitate its economic recovery.

### Recollections of Tagore's Visit to India (II)

— Xu Baoqian

According to the Professor of Indian Philosophy at International University who explained it to me, Indian opera can be divided into northern and southern schools, and what Tagore advocated was actually a mixture of the two schools, to achieve harmony.

At six o'clock in the morning on the eighth, we participated in the students' prayer meeting, and afterwards, we audited the students' classes, both of which were held outdoors. The most noteworthy point for us was that the number of students in each class was less than fifteen. After the auditing, we went together to a village nearby named Sri-niketan to visit Tagore's rural work (details below). In the afternoon, the faculty and students of the college invited Ms. Lester, the head of the visiting delegation, to speak about the prospects for the new world, and also invited China to build the country. That evening, we left Peace Village.

Tagore's Life

Tagore came from a distinguished family. His father, Devendranath Tagore, was called Mlaharishi (meaning great hermit or master) at the time and lived in Calcutta. Tagore was born on May 6, 1861. According to Tagore's public speech at the Zhenguang Theater in Beijing on May 19, 1924, there were three historical waves with historical significance at that time: the religious reform movement, the new literature movement, and the national self-determination movement. Tagore said that he had made considerable contributions to the second movement. He also said that people often like the new and dislike the old, abandoning their inherent culture to accept Western culture. In fact, the standard for choosing a culture does not lie in whether it is new or old, but in the spiritual value contained in the culture.

Educational Ideal

Tagore was born with a nature that admired nature, loved freedom, and opposed the constraints imposed on children by traditional education. In September 1930, Tagore traveled to Moscow and gave an autobiographical speech to students, which is excerpted below:

"When I was young, I also went to school, but I didn't like taking classes in the classroom because I loved nature. Some teachers lacked sympathy for me. They couldn't understand that some children have tender and sensitive hearts, but instead, they added pressure. In fact, children's disobedience is enough to show the failure of the methods used by teachers. When I was thirteen years old, I escaped from school, and I never went back to school again. After escaping from school, I began to study on my own. I lived in seclusion in a place near the Ganges River, mostly living on a small boat. There, I wrote poetry, wrote novels, wrote plays, and had my sweet dreams. Soon, my reputation gradually spread. Many people came from all over to get to know me, and my secluded life could no longer continue.

"I have never run an educational institution. I don't know how I dared to boldly run education, even I myself am inexplicable. However, I am confident that I have deep sympathy for children, and the location I chose is very quiet and beautiful (ie, Peace Village), far away from the evil and turbid environment of the metropolis. This beautiful environment can stimulate the inherent creativity of human beings. There, I gathered five or six children. I not only taught them but also made friends, singing to them. I made musical scores and scripts, and they helped me perform. This is how the school I founded began.

"I try my best to give my students the opportunity to develop and express themselves freely, and I try my best to arouse their interest in nature, music, art, and the countryside. I think this kind of education is the most ideal. However, later the number of students increased, and there had to be considerable changes. The method of charging tuition fees is one end of the change. Because, in the old Indian ideal, teachers not only provided education free of charge but also bore all the needs of students' lives. When the number of people increased, this method naturally could not continue. However, although I later had to charge fees, I still retained the point that teachers and students must live together, and teachers and students must cooperate in various activities. It is a pity that some teachers hired from outside, due to the background of traditional education, sometimes failed to thoroughly understand my educational purpose. Once, a new teacher, because he saw a few students climbing up a tree to prepare their homework, he became very angry and wanted to punish them. At that time, I had to protect these students and tell the gentleman: Don't punish them. Because soon they will go to the evil society, and maybe they will be separated from nature. Even if you want to climb a tree, I am afraid it will be impossible.

"In addition, there is another point that I also pay special attention to. I try my best to create an international atmosphere in the school. I often invite famous people from the East and West to give lectures at the school. In this way, the narrow minds of students can be gradually expanded, and I am confident that I have achieved considerable success in this regard. Finally, there is one more point. I set up many night classes in nearby villages, so that my students can serve as night school teachers. At the same time, they can get many opportunities to practice in the rural undertakings I run. In this way, education and life can be integrated."

After reading the above confession, we can not only know Tagore's life, but also understand Tagore's educational ideals.

Forest Philosophy

"The mission of the forest" runs through Tagore's entire thought and art, like a refrain in a poem. Tagore once said: "The forest is different from the desert, stone, or ocean. It is alive. It nurtures human life. In the forest, the hermits of ancient India realized the harmony between life and the universe, and the unity of truth. Moreover, they recognized from this the chain between self-spirit and the entire universe." In the realization of life (this book is a collection of speeches given by him at Harvard University), Tagore told the audience: "Indian culture originated in the forests, and the forest environment formed the quality of Indian culture. The greatness of the forest did not make people feel small. On the contrary, the forest environment stimulated the inherent creativity of life and expanded human sympathy. Later, agriculture developed, cities rose, and forests gradually decreased, but Indians still miss and remember the civilization of the forest. Therefore, the Indian viewpoint is very different from the Westerners' view that nature is inhuman and must be conquered."

This idea of worshiping nature, making life and nature one, has its own historical and geographical reasons for its formation. But once formed, it has a profound impact on culture. The forest philosophy produced by the environment of Hinduism. When we read Tagore's poems and prose, such as the famous works Chitra and Gi'anjali, this forest philosophy is revealed everywhere. In the Brahmana chapter of Chitra, Tagore describes the scene of the forest school as follows:

### Gauze Cannot Be Compared with Gauze Cloth; Soaring Cotton Prices Make Speculation Alarming; Midling Raised to 667 Yuan

Transactions of foreign cotton in Shanghai are very active, because both the speculative "football" business and buyers are more active than the actual needs of factories. As a result, the prices of all goods have risen sharply. The price of American cotton Midling in the exchange has even reached a high of 650 yuan in June, which is incomparable with the calm cotton yarn market. As for factories that directly order American cotton or Brazilian cotton from foreign companies, their intention to purchase is also diligent. Yesterday, it was estimated that Chinese-owned yarn factories ordered 500-600 bales of Brazilian cotton, and other foreign-owned yarn factories also purchased about 1,000 bales. At the same time, all of these are fine-velvet raw materials that will arrive in Shanghai soon. The New York cotton market first fell due to long covering and selling at declining prices, then rose again due to some short covering and inter-dealer buying. As a result, the closing price was about 13-14 points higher than the previous day as reported.

The Indian cotton market first rose due to buying by European exporters, then fell due to selling by retail investors and profit-taking. Finally, the market rose again due to short covering and retail support. Yesterday's closing prices rose by about 5-6 rupees each. It is also predicted that the opening market today will fall by two and a half rupees.

Yesterday's spot cotton situation rose step by step, and fine-velvet raw materials were particularly scarce and expensive. The speed of its rush was like electricity, which made those with spot goods even more reluctant to sell. However, the rising trend in the yarn market has stopped, and the factories seem to be weakening in activity. The speculative "football" business is quite lively, and it does not seem to be affected by the recent arrival of a batch of goods, which has increased inventories.

### Large Investors Take Profits and Exit; Yarn Market Plunges

The yarn market turned from high to low. This is because the degree of continuous rise in recent days has been considerable, causing large investors to take profits. At the same time, the sales of 20-count yarn were still narrow, and the demand for 32-count single yarn was also less than the previous day. The rising momentum of margins has been curbed, and the market has declined as a result. The high price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,663 yuan, and the low price was 1,643 yuan. Noon transactions were extremely quiet. Although there were people at the meeting, the asking prices were different. The reason is that the establishment of the Yarn Industry Association Exchange has made transactions cumbersome, and people are unwilling to do more transactions. At the same time, the reaction against yarn prices fell by 12-13 yuan, and morale was even more dispersed. The initial price of Double Horse yarn was 1,647 yuan, which fell to 1,642-1,643 yuan. About 100-200 pieces were traded but not finalized. Today, 85 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong, and 645 pieces were transported to other destinations.

Double Horse Morning Opening: Because the sentiment in the afternoon of the previous day was good and buying was still strong, the initial price was 1,656 yuan. Shortly after, it fell to 1,654 yuan. Then, due to the tightening of margins and strong buying interest, it rose to 1,663 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain trader liquidated a large amount of profits, causing the market to loosen and fall back to 1,643 yuan. Some profit-takers covered short positions, and it rose again to 1,658 yuan. By the time the market closed, it was heard that the exchange price had fallen back, and market sentiment turned loose, closing at 1,644 yuan. The total volume traded in the half-day was 7,780 bales. The amounts bought by various trading groups are listed below: Hong Kong 280, other traders 7,500, totaling 7,780.

The Double Horse Futures market first rose and then fell, and the result was a decline. When the market opened in the morning, the news reported that foreign exchange had to be settled within a time limit, factory vehicles were becoming more expensive, and foreign exchange was shrinking. For a time, people were panicked, and most were inclined to buy. When the market opened in the morning, the August contract was at 1,493 yuan, and it rose rapidly to 1,500 yuan. Then, factory orders turned negative, and the gold market declined sharply. As a result, floating longs sold out their positions while making profits, and the market price declined. The September contract was quoted at 1,590 yuan, up 11 yuan, and the October contract was at 1,595 yuan, down 1 yuan. After entering the afternoon session, the market was weak, and the price continued to fall by 6-7 yuan. The noon close for the August contract was 1,489 yuan, unchanged. The September contract was 1,572 yuan, down 7 yuan. The October contract was 1,584 yuan, also down 2 yuan. The turnover of the spot market was 12,284. Afternoon trading turned weak. Large investors watched from the sidelines and did not take action. The market price fluctuated narrowly, only hovering between 2 and 8 yuan. Because the selling power was relatively strong, the price was slightly lower. As a result, the August contract closed at 1,483 yuan, down 6 yuan. The September contract was at 1,568 yuan, down 11 yuan. The October contract was at 1,584 yuan, down 12 yuan. The total daily turnover was approximately 16,130 bales, a decrease of 310 bales from the previous day. The daily price chart is listed below:

Market Notice: Trading of the August yarn contract will end on the 20th. The November contract will be added on the 21st.

### Food; Small-Grained Rice Used as a Speculative Tool; People Watching for Incidents in Nanyang

Yesterday's transactions in the foreign rice market were mostly speculative, with the most being small-grained varieties. Because the outlets are wider, it has become a bargaining chip for speculation. Yesterday's market was still in this state, so at the opening of the morning market, speculators and retail investors, after seeing the report on the Far East policy issued by Britain and the United States, seemed to think that the prospects for the rice market were quite promising. Then they moved again, using small-grained rice as a bet, capturing and releasing each other. Therefore, under the impact of the crowds, the market price was suddenly excited. At that time, the opening price of small-grained rice at the bank warehouse was 120.5 yuan, and at the foreign warehouse it was 123.5 yuan. Later, as more rice was released, the price once fell slightly. The small-grained rice at the bank warehouse returned to 124 yuan, and at the foreign warehouse it was 123 yuan. After hovering for a while, unexpectedly the atmosphere rose again, and everyone absorbed it. The warning sounded, and the market felt even tighter. The closing price broke through the morning price, and small-grained rice even opened to 125 yuan at the bank warehouse and 124 yuan at the foreign warehouse, an increase of 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan compared to the previous market. Other mid-range goods such as No. 2 Saigon and Siam also increased by 0.5 yuan to nearly 1 yuan. The opening price of No. 2 Saigon was 124.5 yuan, old rice was 126.5 yuan, and rice was 126 yuan. No. 2 Siam was 122.5 yuan to 119.5 yuan. As for high-quality goods such as No. 1 Saigon Siam, Mindang, and Jiafo, as well as broken rice, they have only been sold through actual sales outlets. Now, the street shops are still not smooth, so although the market is inevitably tight, the selling price has not changed much, which can still be called a fixed price. No. 1 Saigon opened at 135.2 yuan to 133.5 yuan, No. 1 Siam opened at 132 yuan to 130 yuan, Jiafo rice was 131-130 yuan, Mindang ordinary goods were 131 yuan, and broken rice was 95-91 yuan. However, as new indica rice from various inland areas will be available soon, and the Municipal Council is continuing to negotiate for Hong Kong rice small-grained varieties, there have been discussions on a fixed price of 144.95 yuan and an allocation price of 151.7 yuan. Yinghua Company small-grained rice ranged from 149 yuan to 150 yuan to 150.05 yuan, No. 2 mixed varieties ranged from 142.24 yuan, 143.58 yuan, and 144.2 yuan, with a maximum of 144.5 yuan. Transactions totaled more than 700 tons. There are now 14,500 bags of foreign rice arriving.

In the thick and thin japonica rice market, because the supply of glutinous rice is abundant, morale is low, and in a state of sluggish sales, the price continues to fall by 1-2 yuan. Fresh early and late rice from South Port opened at 151-152 yuan, Wuxi original package special japonica was 153 yuan, high-quality japonica was 150 yuan, and Zhongguan was 146-144 yuan. As for new japonica rice, a total of 16 stones arrived yesterday, and sales in stores are still behind, resulting in oversupply and a price decline of 1 yuan, opening at 155-156 yuan. Glutinous rice is still only some small-volume demand, so although the owners have little stock, the asking prices are all similar to before.

### Flour Market Continues to Rise

In the current foreign flour market, the rising trend has intensified. This is because there are many Taiping factories, and speculators do not see good prospects. Although there is talk of importing large quantities of American flour, there are fears that the supply will not be sustained, so Japanese merchants are responding. Near noon, a large trader took in 10-20 thousand bags, so the prices of Jinlong flour and Paotai flour have risen to 33 yuan and 34 yuan respectively. Jinlong flour opened at 32.9 yuan to 33.1 yuan, Paotai flour opened at 34.1 yuan to 34.4 yuan, and Xiangjiao brand opened at 33.5 yuan, and Caishen brand opened at 34 yuan, all increasing by 4-5 jiao compared to the previous day. Transactions totaled about 30,000 bags, and the market is very active.

Wheat: Yesterday, there was a slight source of new wheat, with more than 300 bags brought from the suburbs, all of which were taken in by Japanese factory stores, priced at 41-42 yuan. On the Chinese side, there is still no considerable supply to be taken. Buying and selling in the market is imitating stagnation.

### Financial Market Fluctuates; Foreign Exchange Unstable

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: The HSBC registered exchange rates did not change. The gray market for British and American exchange continued to tighten, and the trend was erratic. It opened tight in the morning, and in the double storm of speculators and importers, banks lacked the intention to supply, so August US dollars at 4.78125 were once difficult to trade. However, soon it was heard that HSBC's small amount of US exchange was still 4.8125, and the bank sold a huge amount at the above price. The storm had already subsided, but Huashang Bank suddenly started to sell, and Chinese merchants also turned to sell, and the trend suddenly hardened. US dollars at 4.875 were difficult to sell. British exchange was still stable. In the afternoon, silk exporters sold export bills of exchange, and British banks, HSBC, had profitable absorption. Importers and Chinese merchants bought in, and the trend became soft. Finally, both exchanges tightened again. The trading was quite brisk throughout the day.

Large Amounts of Chinese Merchants Sell Off

Since the silver market in foreign news only showed a slight decline in the recent period of Indian silver, the rest and the US silver were flat. The exchange rate of various countries against Shanghai was down 0.0625 for the British exchange and 6 points for the US exchange, the rest were flat. The central listing of various exchanges did not change. At the opening of the morning interbank selling price, the spot British exchange was 2 pence 875 and the US dollar was 4.8125, which was up 0.015625 for the British exchange and 0.03125 for the US exchange compared to the closing price of the previous day. After the opening, importers and speculators bought in, causing the US dollar to be difficult to close at the above price, softening to 4.78125. In the midst of the confusion, it tightened back to 4.75. HSBC's listing was flat. The white silver balance tax was still 24.25 percent. HSBC's small amount of US exchange was still 4.8125, and the bank sold it to import foreign firms and Chinese merchants at the above price.

The market suddenly loosened, and speculators turned to sell to a certain foreign bank August at 4.875, hardening to the point where it could be closed. The noon close was 2 pence 875 for British exchange and 4.84375 for the US dollar.

Exporters Sell Off

In the afternoon, speculators and importers continued to buy in. August and September US dollars at 4.84375 were sold by exporters to HSBC at a favorable export bill price of 4.875 and 84375, so Chinese and foreign merchants only bought in at 4.8125 again. The market trended tight until the 3:30 pm close. The spot to September futures were both 2 pence 875 for British exchange and 4.8125 for the US dollar, which was up 0.015625 for the British exchange and 0.03125 for the US exchange compared to the closing of the previous day.

### Fluctuations in the Gold Market, Highly Variable

Yesterday, the gold market experienced a volatile trading session on both the official and black markets. Prices initially rose, then fell, breaking through the 7,200-yuan mark before retreating, and then fluctuated upwards again. Market participants were both apprehensive and hopeful. This was due to the foreign exchange market, which initially tightened, then stabilized, and finally softened. Building on the previous day's gains, buyers rushed in, pushing prices up to a high of 7,265 yuan. Later, rumors spread that HSBC was offering US dollars at 4.8125 yuan, and that other banks in China were also selling dollars, further easing the exchange rate. These rumors dispelled earlier anxieties. With sentiment stabilized, long positions were sold off. Under pressure from Xinyuan and securities firms, along with retail investors taking short positions, short sellers in the Shanghai West district became active, causing prices to plummet to 7,122 yuan. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market tightened again. With buying interest from Yida, Xiangxing, Yongxin, Fengyong, and Yonglitai, prices rose to 7,180 yuan. However, strong selling by Yiyuan forced prices back down, and the market closed with a gain of only two yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 150,000 to 160,000 taels.

Amidst the chaos, prices rose to 7,220 yuan. Defu and Tianyuan aggressively sold, dropping the price to 7,190 yuan. At that time, the supply of foreign exchange was low, making it difficult to settle even at 4.78125 yuan. Xinfeng, Yongxiang, Hede, Cheng, and retail investors aggressively bought, pushing prices up by more than 70 yuan to 7,265 yuan. Because HSBC was still offering US dollars at 4.8125 yuan, the market momentum was thwarted. Chengji, Yida, Dingsheng, Tianyuan, and Defu rushed to sell, causing a sharp decline of 120 yuan to 7,140 yuan. Then, with Yida, Shunyuan, and short covering, prices rebounded by 55 yuan, reaching 7,200 yuan. However, as foreign exchange remained loose, Chengji, Yiyuan, Xinyuan, Xiangxing, and Yong again aggressively sold, causing another drop of 78 yuan to 7,122 yuan. The midday closing price was 7,132 yuan. After the close, prices rose to 7,145 yuan, then fell back to around 7,130 yuan.

Yiyuan, Yifeng, Chengji, and Defu sold, pushing prices back to 7,135 yuan. Xiangxing and Yong then aggressively bought again. Yida, Xinfeng, Yonglitai, Tongkang, and Yongjun all absorbed supply, resulting in positive sentiment. Prices then rose to 7,180 yuan. Dachang, Yifeng, and retail investors sold, suppressing prices to a closing price of 7,152 yuan, only two yuan higher than the previous day's close. Calculated based on the September US dollar exchange rate of 4.8125 yuan, the settlement price was 7,236 yuan, a difference of 84 yuan.

### Securities and Bond Markets Hover, Waiting for Change

In the grey market for public bonds, yesterday's market continued to weaken, and sentiment was extremely sluggish. The market was filled with a sense of inactivity. Most long positions remained unchanged, willing to bear the responsibility of interest payments. Short positions were naturally unwilling to cover during this period.

### Shanghai Celebrates the Anglo-American Declaration
#### Chinese and Foreigners Alike Encouraged, Awaiting the Realization of True World Peace as China's Final Victory Becomes Increasingly Concrete

Since the meeting at sea between US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill and the subsequent issuance of the Anglo-American joint declaration, all Chinese and Westerners in this city have unanimously expressed their sincere support for the joint statement. Nationals from countries such as Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Norway, Yugoslavia, Free France, and Poland, whose territories have been lost due to the war, are even more interested. This is because, in the post-war world order, "all countries can live in peace within their borders" and "all countries that have been deprived by force can restore their sovereignty and autonomous government."

### Confidence Strengthens Among Foreign Nationals

Foreign nationals from these countries are increasingly confident, given that the new world order will surely be realized. In addition to vigorously mobilizing foreign residents in Shanghai to unite, they are also promoting various service movements, such as raising donations for the Red Cross, aviation funds, and dispatching volunteers to the front lines to fight to the death against the enemy.

### British and Americans Greatly Encouraged

As for the British and American authorities in Shanghai, they are reluctant to comment much on this new development as the facts are clear. However, foreign nationals from both countries are silently praying that this historic declaration will guarantee the realization of true world peace, so that people can live and work in peace. British foreign national groups, such as the Royal Air Force Association, the Wartime Service Association, and the British Residents Association, have been greatly encouraged by this declaration.

### Chinese Unanimously Support It

As for Soviet foreign nationals, they believe that the Anglo-American joint declaration demonstrates the determination of both countries to eliminate the Nazis and their enthusiasm for helping the Soviet Union. They are all overjoyed. On the Chinese side, close attention is being paid to this development. It is believed that the United Kingdom and the United States will strengthen cooperation in the Far East through this declaration, curb the spread of Nazi allies, and make the hope of China's final victory more concrete and certain.

### Laying a Rational Foundation for the World

Mr. Morley of the British Information Office broadcasted on CDN radio last night on current events. He stated briefly that the secret and dramatic meeting at sea between Roosevelt and Churchill had been made clear due to the report of British Chief Secretary Attlee. The eight principles of the Roosevelt-Churchill joint statement not only confirmed the final victory, but also built a more perfect and reasonable foundation for the world in history. It is predicted that Hitler will inevitably attack from other places to obtain the rich oil fields of the Caucasus due to the failure of the invasion of the Soviet Union. The most likely places for Hitler to pass through are Turkey and Iran. However, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have jointly made firm guarantees to Turkey that if it is attacked, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union will provide full assistance. This guarantee has been warmly welcomed by Ankara. Therefore, regardless of whether Hitler will make this desperate move, his failure is predetermined. Moreover, the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting will make the camps of the world's two major blocs more obvious. The shameful peace rumors fabricated by the enemy have been defeated without being attacked.

### Foreigners Going to the Northeast Will Be Obstructed

### New American Commercial Counselor Arrives in Shanghai, Determined to Maintain Trade
#### Vowing to Overcome All Difficulties and Striving to Improve the Situation in Shanghai as Much as Possible

The newly appointed American Commercial Counselor to China, Mr. Grove, arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 14th aboard the President Coolidge. He stated that he intends to take office immediately and will overcome difficulties to maintain American commerce. The commercial situation here is tied to the international political situation. Any restrictive measures are harmful to trade and normal commerce. Therefore, the freezing and retaliatory measures that have been implemented are bound to have an adverse impact on trade.

### The United States Aims to Protect Its Rights

When asked about the US government's attitude towards the Far East, Mr. Grove expressed his belief that Washington would not obstruct trade unless absolutely necessary and would improve the situation here as much as possible. For example, even though a freezing order has been issued, licenses are still issued for legal American business, which is an example of this. The reason why the United States is implementing restrictions on the Far East is no different from the reason why it is implementing restrictions on Europe, namely, to protect American interests.

### Hoping to Maintain Ongoing Trade

Mr. Grove also mentioned that American trade here has declined due to various restrictions and a lack of ships. He stated that American businessmen should maintain ongoing trade. Even if the amount is reduced, it is better than letting it stop completely. According to Mr. Grove, he has been working for the US government since 1919, serving in commercial positions in Europe, including France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Greece, and the Balkan countries. However, this is his first time in the Far East. Also, the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury* reported that the new American Commercial Counselor to China, Mr. Grove, said that American trade with China may be reduced if necessary, but it must be maintained so that it does not stop abruptly. He believes that Washington will do its best to maintain and improve the situation in Shanghai.

All banks engaged in foreign exchange have now complied with the order and have each found ways to settle their outstanding foreign exchange transactions before July 26 (including August and September futures transactions). The total amount to be entrusted to the Central Bank to handle the redemption in New York, USA, is 1.5 million US dollars, all transferred into the Central Bank's account.

### Harrison Ship to Depart This Morning

The President Coolidge of the American President Lines, which was originally scheduled to return to the United States from Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday, has been postponed to yesterday morning due to insufficient cargo loading.

The reply is currently being awaited.

### No News from Huaian

According to unconfirmed reports received by personnel from the Shanghai American Presbyterian Church, the female missionary belonged to the Presbyterian Church and was strangled to death about a week ago, but this information has not been confirmed because the church in Shanghai cannot communicate with Huaian.

All four worked at a hospital in Qingjiangpu that has now been closed. It is reported that they were imprisoned in their residences a week ago.

### The Municipal Council's Finance Committee Will Review the New Tax Plan
#### It is Rumored That It Will Be Passed Based on the Original Plan and a Final Decision Will Be Made on September 3

In order to make up for the budget shortfall for this year, the Municipal Council plans to levy a special business tax. On the 24th of last month, the Tax System Committee submitted a report to the Municipal Council meeting. After discussion, it was resolved to hand it over to the Finance Committee for review. Because the Municipal Council meeting was on vacation during the summer, the first meeting after the summer vacation will be held on September 3, so the Finance Committee did not immediately convene a meeting. However, the financial situation of the Municipal Council is becoming more and more difficult, and it is believed that it is necessary to submit it for review immediately. Therefore, it was decided to convene a meeting in the Municipal Council conference room at 4:00 p.m. on the 18th of this month to conduct a detailed review of the case. It is rumored that the original plan will be passed based on the report of the Tax System Committee, and then submitted to the Municipal Council meeting for discussion and a final decision. Once the Special Business Tax Advisory Committee is established and opinions from all parties are sought, it will be implemented step by step.

### Takabashi Ferry Explodes and Catches Fire

### Zhou Yongquan Abducted

Yesterday at 4:00 p.m., several Japanese people suddenly arrived in a state of alert at Zhou Yongquan Lawyer's Office at 379 Beile Road in the French Concession, insisting on abducting the lawyer to the army and driving to Hongkou. The police learned of the incident and immediately sent a large number of police and translators to the scene. They were immediately taken to the police station for questioning. It was then learned that the incident was an abduction. The reason was that Zhou Yongquan's lawyer filed an application with the Civil Court of the First Special Court to seize the property due to a debt owed by a certain surnamed person. The defendant was unwilling to accept this and instigated Japanese people such as Toshio Eguchi to come forward and gather people to Zhou's law office, intending to abduct him to Hongkou to handle the matter. The police stated that this was a legal issue and advised the Japanese not to arbitrarily arrest people. However, the Japanese insisted that they must take Zhou Lawyer to Hongkou. Their language was very tough, and the police refused to extradite him because there was no sufficient reason. The Japanese left without getting what they wanted.

Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, an assassination and bloodshed occurred in front of the Citibank building on Foochow Road in the Public Concession. The target, He Cheng Bank Manager Ji Kunsheng, died on the spot. The two assailants who fired the shots resulted in one being shot dead by police at the Yunnan Road intersection, and the other was captured. Stray bullets injured nine pedestrians along the way, and one police officer was killed in the line of duty, while another was wounded in the right knee by a bullet. Details are recorded below:

Shot in the Head, Died on the Spot

Ji Kunsheng, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang, was 29 years old and resided at 182 Avenue Magny, French Concession. At 9:20 AM yesterday morning, Ji emerged from the Citibank building, west of the Central Police Station on Foochow Road. Ji was wearing a light grey suit and white leather shoes. As he walked across from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, intending to board his personal car, license number 6681, two thugs lying in wait there. One of them pulled out a pistol and fired one shot at Ji, hitting him in the mouth, passing through the back of his head, immediately causing blood to gush out. He fell to the ground and died instantly. Seeing their objective achieved, the assailants jumped into a car, license number 3475, parked nearby, and sped west along Foochow Road to escape. The Central Police Station, located nearby, received the report and immediately dispatched detectives to pursue them, firing shots at the car. The thugs in the car also frequently fired back, resisting arrest. This led to a rare major gunfight in the Central District. The sound of gunfire on Foochow Road was dense, bullets flying like rain. Police officers at various intersections also joined the pursuit, with intense gunfire and blaring sirens. The car fled to the intersection of Foochow Road and Fujian Road, where it was blocked by police officers facing them. Realizing the situation was dire, the thugs exited the car and fled, while continuing to shoot. They struck Chinese police officer number 1199 in the chest, who fell to the ground, dying in the line of duty in front of the Tongxing Restaurant. The two thugs fled to the Hubei Road intersection, where they shot Chinese police officer number 880 in the right knee, causing him to collapse in front of the Qinglian Pavilion. Detectives were still pursuing closely behind. As a result, one thug, wearing a grey-colored Paletot suit, was shot several times at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Nanjing Road, near the Maochang Optical Company, and was captured. He was identified as Tang Chunshan (22 years old), who died soon after due to his injuries. The other thug was surrounded and arrested at the Hubei Road intersection and has confessed to participating in the assassination.

Nine Bystanders, Male and Female, Injured

After the incident, the police immediately cordoned off the Foochow Road area and conducted a thorough search. It was reported that two more suspects were apprehended and taken in for questioning. As the thugs resisted arrest along the way, bullets flew in all directions. Stray bullets hit nine pedestrians, including: (1) Sun Yunsheng (30 years old), (2) Chen Jinan (31 years old), (3) Jiang Xiasong (29 years old), all injured in the buttocks; (4) Li Yousong (21 years old), injured in the thigh; (5) Chen Guanghui (32 years old), grazed in the chest; (6) Zhuang Da (31 years old), injured in the right foot; (7) Wang Xuechun (31 years old), injured in the thigh; (8) Chen Wangshi (38 years old), and (9) Zhang Maoshi (17 years old), both injured in the feet. They were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The bodies of Ji Kunsheng and the Chinese police officer were sent to the coroner's office, while the injured police officer was sent to the Municipal Council Hospital. At the same time, the large glass windows of the Zhonghua Book Company and Wuzhou Pharmacy were also damaged by gunfire. There were also rumors that there were about a dozen thugs, traveling in two cars, lying in wait on Foochow Road, beside the Central Police Station. Some escaped in another car, while the others tried to escape in car number 3475, but were intercepted by detectives. The license plate number 3475 was registered to a foreign doctor, suggesting it was forged by the assailants. It was also rumored that the car was stolen from a Chinese person in front of the Paramount Ballroom a few days ago.

Young, Handsome, and Successful

Ji was born in Chongqing on November 16, 1913. His father, Ji Zhishou, is 64 years old and currently in Chongqing, serving as the Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Finance and the General Manager of He Cheng Bank. Ji himself graduated from St. John's University in Shanghai in 1936 and then engaged in business in Shanghai. He first worked at the American Asiatic Underwriters and later served as the Shanghai Manager of He Cheng Bank, which specialized in domestic remittances and had a thriving business. At the same time, he founded the Kejing Company, specializing in the export of lace. In his spare time, he would write articles and publish them in English financial and commercial weekly journals. Ji was young, handsome, and amiable in his dealings with people, and had never participated in any political activities. This sudden assassination is unclear. It is said that Ji had recently received threatening letters, so he moved to the American Club for safety, but unfortunately, he was still assassinated. Those who heard of this were filled with sorrow. His body has been examined and sent to the International Funeral Parlor. The funeral is scheduled for 3:00 PM on the 17th.

The maid brought the two baskets to the mistress of the house and asked the man to wait in front of the door. Later, the mistress accepted the gifts and gave the maid a few dollars to give to the man, but when the maid went outside, the man had disappeared.

### Seven Orphaned Children Apply for Scholarships, Describing Their Family Experiences; Childlike Innocence and Genuine Emotions Revealed, Determined to Learn and Not Discouraged

The seven orphaned children graduating from the Youjiao Nursery have all been admitted to Suzhou Middle School this semester. Through the introduction of the nursery, they applied to the newspaper for the "Readers' Scholarship Fund." The day before yesterday afternoon, they came to the office in an organized group to describe their family backgrounds and experiences. They are all wanderers from the atmosphere of war, some lost their fathers, some lost their mothers, and one is an orphan with both parents deceased. Although this is the case, they are not discouraged and are all determined to learn. Below are the written statements from each of them.

Ou Debiao

Before August 13th, I lived at a certain address in Lai'an Lane, Xinmin Road, Zhabei. When the war broke out, the house was occupied, and my father, mother, siblings, and I escaped to the New World Shelter. After living there for more than a year, the New World was reclaiming the property, so we moved to the Guangci First Shelter on Wenyi Road. Unfortunately, my parents contracted typhoid fever and said goodbye to me forever in the hospital! I had to rely on my sister to survive. Fortunately, the director of the shelter introduced me to the Gonghua Shelter, where I lived for a year, before the Gonghua Shelter was reorganized into the Youjiao Nursery until now. I have already graduated from the nursery. Recently, I heard that your newspaper is launching the "Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund," and we are really happy. The teachers at the nursery took us to Suzhou Middle School to register for the entrance exam, which was an unexpected joy. Later, we were admitted, and the teachers told us to immediately fill out the forms and send them to your newspaper, hoping that your newspaper will do its best to help us so that we will not be at risk of dropping out of school. I will study hard so as not to let down the kindness and support of the gentlemen of your newspaper and philanthropists from all walks of life.

Lu Jialiang

Before August 13th, I was in the countryside of Baoshan County. After the war broke out, I escaped from the countryside and wandered into the concession for a day. Later, relatives introduced us to the Cishi Shelter, where we lived for more than a year. My parents went home to see the hometown, but it was burned down, with only a pile of rubble left. My parents returned to Shanghai and took me back to the countryside to live with relatives. We had a place to live, but what about food? My father was very sad and went to work, but a day's wages were only one yuan, which was not enough to live on. Our relatives in Shanghai found out and wrote to introduce me to the Gonghua Shelter, where I lived for a year before it was reorganized into the Youjiao Nursery. I was in the first semester of sixth grade. At this time, unfortunately, my father died, and my mother lived alone at home. Now that I have graduated from sixth grade, I cannot afford to continue my education, so I am asking for assistance.

Huang Rongsheng

I lived at a certain address in Shouyuan Lane, Xietu Road, Luban Road in the Nanshi, with my parents and younger brother. My father was a carpenter. I studied at a nearby primary school for free. My younger brother did not go to school. When I was ten years old, my mother passed away, and I was very sad. My younger brother cried every day. But later, the war broke out, and my father, my younger brother, and I fled to the concession. In the evening, the Renji Hall card sent us to the Huicheng Shelter. Later, an acquaintance sent me to the Gonghua Shelter. After a few years, the Gonghua Shelter was reorganized into the current Youjiao Nursery.

Gao Zhongde

My father worked at the Commercial Press but lost his job during the war. Our family of eight fled to the Fuxing Shelter on Foochow Road. A year later, the Fuxing Shelter was disbanded, and we entered the Ciyuan Shelter. At this time, my mother asked a friend to introduce me to the Youjiao Nursery. On November 21st of the 29th year of the Republic, my mother said goodbye to us forever. The year my mother passed away, I was already fifteen years old. My older brother is a hawker, and my younger brother is studying at Ciyuan. Now that I have graduated from primary school at the Youjiao Nursery, I am specially applying to your newspaper for a scholarship so that I can continue my studies.

Zhang Chaolun

Before the Shanghai War, my family lived in the countryside near Shanghai. When I was nine years old, my mother died. My father worked in Shanghai, and the family's finances were considered wealthy. When the war broke out, our family of four fled to the concession. My father lost his job, so it was difficult to maintain our livelihood. Fortunately, an acquaintance introduced us to the International Relief Committee's Sixth Refugee Shelter, which provided food and lodging, and valuable opportunities to study. Later, due to economic reasons, the shelter was disbanded. I was sent to the Youjiao Nursery Gonghua Shelter to continue my studies. Now that I have graduated from primary school, I still want to continue my studies, but I cannot afford the tuition. Seeing that your newspaper is launching a scholarship fund specifically to benefit underprivileged children, I could not have dreamed of it.

Yan Houzhang

Before the war broke out, my family lived at Dongjiadu in the Nanshi, a family of five. I was studying at Dongjiadu Catholic Church Zhengxiu First Primary School. After the war broke out, we fled to my hometown of Wuxing County. After two years, we fled back to Shanghai. At that time, my father had already lost his job. Through a relative's introduction, he went to the Bund to work as a clerk, earning only 20 yuan a month, barely making ends meet. Through an introduction, I went to the Youjiao Nursery to study. In the blink of an eye, I have already graduated from primary school. Later, the Shen Bao published information about the scholarship fund. Our class teacher told me to take the entrance exam for Suzhou Middle School, as well as Xinbei Middle School and others. Fortunately, I was admitted. Because the Shen Bao is paying for our tuition and miscellaneous fees, this is such a happy thing! I am truly grateful!

Hu Jisheng

After my hometown was occupied, I fled to Shanghai to my uncle's house. Because my uncle's family had many people, the monthly expenses were not enough, so I could not stay for long. Therefore, I asked my uncle to find a school for refugee relief. As a result, he sent me to the Youjiao Nursery. I was very happy that the nursery had books to read and food to eat. It was just like a home. I studied for two years and graduated, but I felt that my knowledge and skills were not enough, so I was very sad. Now your newspaper is able to help poor students! This is very rare, so I am applying for a scholarship; I hope to acquire rich knowledge.

### Praying for Rain Parade

— Guo Hongdi

According to a friend who just arrived in Shanghai, a certain place has been suffering from drought for six months. The land is cracked, and the farmers are suffering. The county magistrate, to show compassion for the people's suffering, initiated a parade to pray for rain and forced all the students in the elementary schools to participate. The result is unknown.

In ancient times, our ancestors regarded natural phenomena such as wind, rain, thunder, and lightning as incomprehensible mysteries, believing them to be manifestations of the anger and power of the gods. This was understandable in an ignorant and unenlightened ancient society. However, in the scientifically advanced 20th century, we have long understood that these are natural phenomena that have nothing to do with gods. In the Soviet Union, scientists are experimenting with artificial rain, and it is said that they have already achieved considerable success. It is expected that in the near future, humans will be able to control the wind and rain, which will not be a strange thing.

However, it is pitiful that in our China, the thinking of some people is not much different from that of people in primitive times. We still believe that rain can be obtained by praying for it, that drought is the will of Heaven, and perhaps some people still believe that it is the punishment of the gods.

Schools should be educational institutions that disseminate scientific knowledge, and school children are the backbone of the future society. However, in our China, they have to abandon scientific knowledge to participate in parades to pray for rain. This is such a pitiful and ridiculous thing.

In terms of science and thought, we are too far behind others. We must catch up quickly.

### Mosquito Swarms in the Frigid Zone

— Qian Jiajun

Most people think that the hottest climates have the most mosquitoes and the most intense harm. However, this is incorrect. The northern parts of Asia, Europe and America are teeming with swarms of mosquitoes.

During the Soviet-Finnish War, after the German-Finnish forces launched an offensive in northern Europe, the slowness of their advance was an undeniable fact. While this was certainly due to the Soviet Union's valiant resistance, the mosquitoes lurking in the forests and swamps also played a role. When the German soldiers were fighting or sleeping soundly, they immediately launched "air raids," desperately sucking the blood of the Germanic people with their sharp mouths, and then triumphantly flying back to their original defenses. These "airplanes" made the Nazi army feel even more afraid than the British Hurricane and Spitfire aircraft, because even the best anti-aircraft guns made by the Krupp arms factory could not deal with them.

In northern Canada, an American expedition discovered that the mosquitoes there were indeed much larger. Slapping one's palm on the table was sure to kill over a hundred mosquitoes, sometimes turning the hand completely red. On average, there were thirty mosquitoes per six square inches on the mosquito nets, so each net contained as many as fourteen thousand mosquitoes. Several explorers found that if they put their hands in the air for five minutes, fifty or sixty mosquitoes would land on them.

In several places in Outer Mongolia, when travelers or caravans had to travel long distances, they would choose to spend the night on dry highlands every night. Mosquitoes are also quite numerous here. After sunset, countless blood-sucking demons fly out of the salt lakes. Therefore, if there are livestock, special care must be taken. Otherwise, in the silent night, one can hear the sheep running around and wailing as they flee from the mosquito swarms, or the next morning, one can see horses with blood-soaked skin rubbing frantically against the wheels because of the itching.

In the forests of Manchuria, a white tent cloth can be covered with mosquitoes and turn black. If one shakes an insect net in the air for a while, one can catch pounds of mosquitoes, and all their blood collected together is estimated to be more than a pint. Therefore, one must wear veils and gloves when walking in the woods. If the skin is exposed, hundreds of mosquitoes will rush to suck blood, and it will take two or three weeks for the wound to return to its original state.

Historical Anecdotes

### Qin Hua Li

— Zhu Yu

— Ai Zi's New Interpretation, Part 2

Ai Zi told a story one day.

During the era of the Three Sovereigns, there was a man named Tian Ba who lived in Jixia and claimed to be the best at handling matters, able to resolve any major problem. Everyone admired him immensely.

Tian Ba had a disciple named Qin Hua Li, who had learned many of his teacher's insightful and brilliant theories.

One day, Qin Hua Li was strutting proudly down the street when he was stopped by an old woman.

"Disciple of Tian Ba, this old woman has a question to ask," the old woman said.

"Ask away, I, Qin Hua Li, have never encountered a problem that I cannot solve."

The old woman said, "The horse's mane points upward and is short, while the horse's tail points downward and is long. What is the reason for this?"

"Oh, ha ha!" the logic expert laughed, "That's very easy. The horse's mane points upward to show stubbornness, so Heaven punishes it by making it short. The horse's tail points downward to show humility, so Heaven rewards it by making it long."

"But, Mr. Qin, hair grows upward defiantly, so why is it long? The beard droops downward humbly, so why is it short?"

"This ah..." Qin Hua Li's logic hit a wall. Helpless, he said, "Let me go ask my teacher. Please wait here, and I will give you a thousand cowrie shells as a reward."

Mr. Qin, dripping with sweat, arrived at Tian Ba's house, breathlessly reporting everything, how he had resolved the horse's hair with the logic of defiance and obedience, but could not resolve human hair, and finally added:

"Teacher, that damned old woman is still waiting outside for our reward!"

Tian Ba thought for a full hour but could not find a way to answer. He led his disciple out the back door, thinking, "Fortunately, it's a small matter. What if it were a major national affair?"

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Chapter 11: Serenade at Midnight

As he spoke, he opened a small door and tried to step out.

"It's getting late, aren't you going to sleep yet?" Qiu Haitang asked, looking at his back.

"It doesn't matter whether I sleep or not." Yu Kun's body was already outside the door. "Your daughter has returned tonight. I can no longer sleep in the same room with you. Tell Xiaogouzi to spread a few bundles of wheat stalks on the ground for me. You don't have to ask me when I'm coming back!"

His voice faded as he spoke, and Qiu Haitang could barely hear half of the last sentence.

Since Yu Kun decided to come to Zhangshupu, he had not wanted to mention Luo Xiangqi to Qiu Haitang, but as soon as Mei Shi saw him, she couldn't help but think of what happened three years ago when he came here to persuade her father to go to Beiping to meet her mother.

Because she had such a heavy matter in her mind, she had been unable to sleep well after getting into bed, but when Qiu Haitang asked her many questions about school, she gave irrelevant answers. Qiu Haitang thought that she was too tired and wanted to sleep, so she couldn't bear to ask her any more questions and tried to calm down and quietly fall asleep.

As a result, the older one fell asleep first, while the younger one continued to toss and turn in bed.

"I wonder where Mom is now?" She closed her eyes and thought deeply. "Uncle Zhao should know. I must inquire about it from him tomorrow, and even if Dad doesn't let me go see her immediately, as long as school starts, I can at least write to her... (186)

### Dog Wears Dentures

— Kezhong

The progress and development of dentistry in recent years has undoubtedly benefited mankind. Not only can patients suffering from dental diseases no longer suffer unnecessary pain, but also elderly people who have lost their teeth can enjoy the pleasure of chewing again. Recently, a dental technician in Chicago, USA, kept a dog that had lost many of its teeth. The technician felt sorry for it and fitted it with a set of dentures so that his beloved dog could still show its terrifying white teeth when barking madly and would not experience the inconvenience of being toothless when eating.

How many people do not engage in such "brilliant arguments" now, even when it comes to major national affairs?

### Chrysanthemum Kingdom Chronicles

— Xiaoxian

(1) The Tongtian Sect Leader Has Many Students (Part 2)

Xue Yanqin, Mao Jianpei, Du Liyun, Hua Huilin, Xin Yanqiu, Zhang Eyuan, Ma Yanyun, Hu Bilan, Zhao Xiuyun. Zhu Chaohua, Wang Yurong, Zhang Yunyan, Deng Deqin, Zhao Jinrong, Feng Yufu, Wang Yulan, Jin Hemei, Hou Yulan. Bai Yuwei, Zhang Guanzhu, Yan Yueqiu, Yang Yanxia, Zhang Meiyun, (the above are female) more than fifty people. In addition, there are many amateur performers not listed. However, in reality, not all of the above fifty people can be considered Yaoqing's disciples. Mei Lanfang, Wang Huifang, and Jiang Miaoxiang were all students of Chen Shoutou Delin. Yaoqing was one of Chen's six major disciples (the so-called six major disciples are Wang Yaoqing, Wang Huifang, Mei Lanfang, Jiang Miaoxiang, Wang Qinnong, and Yao Yufu. Lanfang, Huifang, and Miaoxiang are indeed fellow disciples. As for Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, and Xiao Cuihua, they all came from opera schools. Cheng Yanqiu was a student of Rong Diexian, making him Yaoqing's grand-disciple. These people may have sought advice from Yaoqing later and registered as students, but they cannot be called Wang's inner disciples. Now, when Yaoqing talks about his numerous students, he always includes the Four Great Dan, which is inevitably exaggerated. As for Yaoqing's most successful disciples, regardless of female roles, among the male actors, Zhao Tongshen (Furong Cao) and Cheng Yuqing are the most prominent. Tongshen has been in the South for a long time, but Yuqing is the closest to Yaoqing. Yaoqing treats Yuqing with great care, better than his peers. Yaoqing's unique masterpieces "Fiery Flag" and "Loyal Mandarin Ducks" are only taught to Yuqing alone. Yaoqing once told people, "Yuqing can do everything that I can do." Yaoqing's favor towards Yuqing is evident. Yuqing, in Wang's school, became arrogant because of his teacher's favor. His fellow disciples respectfully called him "Senior Brother." Generally, female actors are very respectful to this Senior Brother because Yuqing often spoke about the plays on behalf of the teacher. Even virtuous ones like Zhang Eyuan and Xin Yanqiu were no exception. Therefore, although Wang's students are numerous, Cheng Yuqing is the only one who is influential in Gu Mao Xuan.

### "Real Sound" Popularization Event

— Boyi

For those friends who consider the Real Sound's anniversary concert a rare and excellent performance, here is very good news. The Real Sound Music Society has decided to hold a popularization event at the Russian Art Theatre on Fuxu Road the day after tomorrow, August 18th. The time is still 8:00 PM.

Among non-"music experts," it has always been difficult to accept this type of choral performance. We all have a negative impression of church-style choirs, leading to a prejudice that choral music is a collaborative effort with superfluous voices and wasted manpower.

However, the members of Real Sound have their own "persuasion tactics." I met two who explained it to me as follows: if I can understand the words, then I can understand their choral music.

There are two ways to interpret this statement: one is that the performance makes it easy to understand, and the other is that one only needs to listen to the lyrics. I went to listen, and I immediately understood their words.

We love Real Sound's choral music precisely because it sings about everything that needs to be sung. "From Border to Border" can serve as a war song to protect our national security, "Universal Lament" expresses the anger for our martyred heroes, and "Prisoner's Song" and "Escape" are direct accusations.

Life determines taste. I dare not say that everyone can appreciate the works introduced by Real Sound, but I dare to recommend to the sons and daughters of the motherland who refuse to bow their heads to dreams: this concert will not disappoint you.

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan Enters Primary School in Fine Clothes

The lyricist listened to Yuan Yuan's words with doubt, saying: "Your plan is good, but how can I leave with you? Won't your family accuse me of enticing you to run away? And if they tell them, how would your stepmother allow you to leave with me? Besides, my family wouldn't allow me to do this." Yuan Yuan sighed: "You are too timid! It is not easy for me to be willing to go with you! In ancient times, Hong Fu Nu eloped with Li Jing, wasn't it the same? If you are afraid of being implicated, we can hide for a while, and then show our faces after they go back. As long as we leave a secret message before we leave, we won't be guilty. They'll just think that you and I went to Hangzhou to burn incense, and they can't say anything bad, and we can make excuses in front of Tian Hongyu. After you go back today, bring some clothes, utensils, and books, hire a small boat, and come to my place tomorrow at noon. Have the boat wait quietly at the north of the bridge. Tonight, I will take care of some valuables and go with you. To tell you the truth, over the past few years, I have secretly saved a lot of money, so please don't worry. Until tomorrow night, we can leave through the back door with our families behind our backs, which they won't expect. Do you think this is a good idea?" The lyricist saw that she was both bold and intelligent, and couldn't help but nod and say: "This plan is great, I will definitely go with you. You are willing to do this as a woman, how can I refuse? It's a pity that although you are a second Hong Fu, I am ashamed that I can't learn to be Li Jing." Yuan Yuan smiled slightly: "What kind of person was Shun? What kind of person am I? Those who try can be like this! Haven't you read these few sentences? Those who have the will shall achieve their goals, and as long as you can be determined, what can't be done?" The lyricist was encouraged by her words and turned his sorrow into joy. Looking around and seeing that there was no one else, he couldn't help but embrace Yuan Yuan's waist and gently kissed her cheek. Yuan Yuan gave him a reproachful look, but just as she was about to speak, a little maid rushed upstairs and said: "Lord Tian is here!" (143)

(31) Li Shifang

Li Shifang is the so-called "Little Mei Lanfang" among the current Four Little Famous Dan. When Shifang performed in the opera school, Lanfang happened to return from Shanghai. Someone introduced him to join Mei's school, but Lanfang decided to stay in Beijing for a very short time. Although Shifang once observed the disciple's ceremony, he may not have obtained Lanfang's legacy and suddenly become a legitimate talent. However, I see that the photos of him in opera costumes are elegant and beautiful, and the expression in his eyes resembles Lanfang, which is the reason for his nickname, "Little Mei Lanfang". I have not visited the old capital for ten years, and I have not seen Shifang's plays. Based on the electricity, his Qingyi is better than Song Dezhu and Mao Shilai, who have no foundation, but I don't know how he compares to another of the Four Little Famous Dan, Zhang Junqiu.

Zhang Fukang is willing to pay a price of three thousand coins to invite Han Langen to come to the South and star in a film. This amount is quite expensive. Yesterday, reporters met Han and asked him about the situation. He said: "Although money is good, feelings are also important. My relationship with Guolian's boss Zhang is harmonious, so I cannot leave."

The Jin Xing Film Company established a film and drama training class half a year ago.
