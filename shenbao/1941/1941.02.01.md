### Hitler's Threatening Remarks Strengthen Resolve to Aid Britain; U.S. Vessels, If Interfered With, Will Be Severely Punished; Lend-Lease Bill Amendment Passed by House Foreign Affairs Committee

London - London commentators yesterday believed that Hitler's threat in his speech commemorating the eighth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule to attack escort vessels with torpedoes would absolutely not affect the country's aid to Britain. President Roosevelt has already stated that the United States is determined to implement its policy of aiding Britain, regardless of the dictator's threatening words. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

Washington - Congressional circles believe today that Hitler's threat yesterday to torpedo any vessels transporting military supplies to Britain will not affect Congress's attitude toward the Lend-Lease Bill. Some members believe that the threat is precisely enough to provoke the United States to increase aid to democratic nations in order to fight the totalitarian states. Political circles believe that the fact that the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the amended Lend-Lease Bill and urged its speedy passage only a few hours after Hitler delivered his speech yesterday is of great significance. Committee Chairman Bloom, a Democratic Congressman from New York, stated, "The committee's report is a direct response to Liu Hitler. I hope everyone will add one to it." (United Press dispatch, 30th)

Washington - Senator Glass of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee commented on Hitler's threat of torpedo attacks, saying that anyone who dares to interfere with American ships should be severely punished. He advocated that the United States send ships to where it is allowed to sail under international law, and anyone who dares to interfere should be severely punished. All American evening newspapers have prominently published Hitler's threatening remarks, and members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have taken note of them. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

Washington - Senator George, a Democratic Senator from Georgia and chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, acknowledged yesterday that Hitler's speech stating that he would attack U.S. aid to Britain was a warning to the United States not to use U.S. warships as escorts. George stated that the meaning of this statement is that Germany will treat American ships the same as those of belligerent nations. Senator Taft, a Republican from Ohio, stated that Hitler's speech was intended to remind the country that escorting ships with warships could lead to war, and there was nothing new to it. Senator Glass, a Democrat from Virginia, stated that the United States should do everything possible to help Britain. "When Hitler begins launching torpedo attacks, we should begin the war." (United Press dispatch, 31st)

London - Today, newspapers are all ridiculing and commenting on Hitler's threats against Britain in his speech to the German people yesterday. The newspapers believe that such threats are not enough to frighten Britain or the United States, and will only have the opposite effect of what Hitler wants. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

Washington - The House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday approved the amendment to President Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Bill, appending favorable comments and sending it to the House of Representatives. The House is scheduled to begin debating the bill on Monday. Among the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, seventeen approved the bill and fifteen opposed it. Congressman 約約, a Republican, suggested limiting the scope of aid to Britain to $2 billion, but the committee rejected it. The amendments passed by the House are as follows: (1) The Lend-Lease Bill's effective period will be limited to June 30, 1943. (2) The President is required to report to Congress every ninety days on the implementation of the bill. (3) The President is required to consult with naval and military officials before transporting military supplies abroad. At the same time, Gerard, who served as the U.S. Ambassador to Germany before the European war, told the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee that if Germany defeats Britain, it will carry out a plan to conquer the world. In a general discussion of the world situation, Gerard stated that Brazil has nearly two million people of German descent, and together with the Italian population, they account for 35% of the country's population. The committee also invited Willkie to testify on the bill for the last time upon his return from London. Willkie is currently studying the wartime situation in Britain. The House Executive Committee also approved a bill to raise the national debt limit by $65 billion and authorized the government to collect taxes on bonds in the future. The committee also approved the issuance of small national bonds and Treasury bonds, as proposed by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

Washington - The Lend-Lease Bill proposed by President Roosevelt has been debated for a long time. When the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the bill by a vote of seventeen to eight, this Lend-Lease Bill passed its initial test in Congress today. After this, the bill can be directly discussed by the House of Representatives. According to the Foreign Affairs Committee, four amendments were made when the bill was passed: (1) The implementation period of the bill is limited to two years, ending on June 30, 1943. (2) A declaration is issued stating that the bill should not be interpreted as authorizing the President to allow American warships to escort merchant ships on belligerent waters. (3) The President should report to Congress at least once every ninety days on any actions taken under the powers granted by the bill. (4) The President should consult with the leaders of the Army and Navy before allowing the supply of national defense materials to other countries. Gerard, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany in the first few years of World War I, expressed his opinion in the Foreign Affairs Committee, stating that he supported declaring war on Germany, but later continued to say that there is no need to fight now.

### U.S. Aircraft Production Last Year Reached 5,700

New York - The Washington correspondent of the "New York Herald Tribune" telegraphed this morning that when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a closed-door meeting yesterday, it invited Secretary of War Stimson to report. Stimson stated that the United States manufactured 2,800 fighter planes last year, of which 2,400 were sent to England and the remaining 400 were used by the U.S. Air Force. He also stated that the total number of airplanes manufactured nationwide last year, including training planes, was 5,700. As for the number of each type of aircraft manufactured, it is not convenient to announce. (Haitong dispatch, 31st)

### Welles Delivers Speech Urging Aid to Democratic Nations

New York - Under Secretary of State Welles delivered a speech yesterday stating that if the U.S. Navy is unable to defend both oceans, then the security of the United States will be greatly threatened. Welles stated, "After Germany defeats Britain, the Axis powers will implement a commercial and economic blockade in Latin America." He also stated that Germany will take political cleansing measures in the American republics, or even carry out military aggression. The Secretary of State urged Congress to approve the "Aid to Democracies Bill" because the bill can provide considerable convenience to aiding China, Britain, and Greece, and can also prevent those countries from being forced into a negotiated peace with the Axis powers. He said that such a "peace" document is worthless. He said that the Atlantic Ocean is closely related to the security of U.S. national defense. He solemnly pointed out that the reason Germany is currently unable to carry out aggression against Britain is because the British Navy is able to control the seas. Once the British Navy is destroyed, the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean will be open to attack. The current U.S. Navy is only enough to control one ocean, which is very dangerous. The Under Secretary of State also stated that since the United States has not been able to obtain a guarantee of stable peace in the Pacific, it has been forced to keep its fleet there. Therefore, the security of the Atlantic Ocean depends on the maintenance of the U.S.'s allies. This is an important issue of national security. Welles said that the Monroe Doctrine is completely different from Japan's "New Order." He also said that the U.S.'s relations with Far Eastern countries are based on adhering to treaties and accepting international rights. He said, "We find it quite humorous that the official spokesperson of the Japanese government stated that because we extended our defense to the Western Pacific, we intended to adopt an aggressive policy in the East. This official also told us that since the United States maintained the Monroe Doctrine and implemented it in the Western Hemisphere, it could not condemn Japan for establishing a 'New Order' in the Far East." The United States has always been willing to improve relations with friendly countries within the possible scope. The United States has recently never attempted to establish sovereignty in the Pacific. The U.S.'s entire defense line is influenced by foreign policies and actions. The reason we have demarcated this defense line is to ensure our country's security. The Monroe Doctrine has always been a self-defense policy, not an aggressive policy."

### U.S. Secretary of the Navy Expresses Determination to Fight Hitler and Die

Chicago - Secretary of the Navy Knox told 2,000 members of the Illinois Road Merchants Association, "I would rather fight Hitler and die than be enslaved by him." The United States is currently standing on the sidelines of the most important battle in world history and cannot morally evade the responsibility of providing as much aid as possible to Britain. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

### British and American Cooperation in the Far East, Matsuoka Says Cannot Be Ignored

Tokyo - Foreign Minister Matsuoka declared yesterday that if the situation in the Pacific deteriorates further due to the U.S. Congress passing the Lend-Lease Bill, the United States developing naval and air force bases in the Pacific, and British and American cooperation in that area, then Article 3 of the Axis powers' alliance with Japan may come into effect. As for China and the South Sea, British and American actions in those two areas are very relevant to Japan, so the Japanese government is currently paying attention to the situation in those two areas from diplomatic and military observation points. According to Matsuoka, this statement was made in response to questions in the House Budget Committee. The questioner stated that the Lend-Lease Bill currently being discussed by the U.S. Congress also includes Asia, and Japan's lifeline has been threatened by British and American cooperation in the Pacific and the United States strengthening its naval and air force bases in the Pacific. He asked what the government's attitude was towards this. When the spokesman for the Information Bureau received news reporters today, he clarified Matsuoka's views, stating that the invocation of the Tripartite Pact depends on Japan's decision. Future developments may inevitably lead to this. In any case, Japan will be loyal to the Tripartite Pact. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

### Hitler Vows to Launch Submarine Offensive Against Britain; Warns U.S. Not to Interfere in European War

Berlin - Hitler said yesterday in a speech commemorating the eighth anniversary of his rule in Berlin, "I have repeatedly heard that Britain wants to launch a general offensive. I would like to know where their general offensive will be launched in Europe so that I can evacuate the people there. I am happy not to give them any difficulty in landing, and we will express our views again in the only language they understand." Hitler warned the United States not to interfere in the war, saying that "Europe will reject all attempts by American countries to interfere in the European war." Apart from mentioning the spring submarine offensive, Hitler did not mention the future course of the war, only saying that "Wherever we can strike Britain, we will strike them." Hitler claimed that the people of Germany and Italy cannot be alienated by British propaganda, and that the close unity between the Italian people and Mussolini cannot be severed by one or two unfortunate events. A large part of Hitler's speech was devoted to criticizing Britain, and he reiterated the claim that Germany was not the culprit in the last war and that Germany had not failed. Hitler also said, "We are standing on the European continent, and no one can move us. We have created several bases. When the time is ripe, we will make a decision that will determine the overall situation. We are ready. They will learn a lesson from this year's history. They are now begging the United States for help, but we have already considered all possibilities. Germany has never had any interest in the Americas." Hitler continued to speak of his efforts to maintain peace, saying, "My peace efforts ultimately failed because they were opposed by the combined forces of the cruel Jewish nation of the bourgeoisie and the jealousy and intolerance of the [missing character] ambition. I have never had a point of contention with Britain." He also said, "British labor leaders are now copying Nazi socialism. If the war continues, Britain will suffer terrible consequences. At that time, they will send specialists to Germany to receive our social programs." Hitler reiterated his peace proposals since the start of the war, saying, "After the collapse of the Four European war, I extended my hand to Britain, but I was met with ridicule and angry scolding. They have spat in my face." Hitler spoke of the U.S.'s possible aid to Britain, saying, "Anyone who wants to help Britain must know that all ships sailing to our torpedo tubes will be torpedoed. If the United States wants to interfere in the European war, then Europe will reject this attempt." He also said, "Britain's extravagant hope of ruling the world has been shattered by the emergence of the German-Italian alliance. It is useless to predict discord between Germany and Italy, or to say that Italy will break away from Germany, and it is useless to create the myth of an Italian revolution. We will strike Britain where we can strike them. If Britain thinks that Italy's occasional misfortune is proof of British victory, then I really don't know what it's based on." Hitler spoke of his relationship with Mussolini, saying, "We are neither Jews nor shopkeepers. We have shaken hands, and this is a handshake between honorable people. If the British think that propaganda and slander can alienate the Germans, then I will say that they should not sleep so soundly. This is as absurd and ridiculous as their attempt to alienate the Italians from the Italian Prime Minister. We are now entering 1941 with the strongest armed forces in German history. This spring, we will begin submarine warfare. At that time, the enemy will realize that we have not been dreaming. We are confident that we will win. We pray to God not to abandon our struggle in 1941." After Hitler finished speaking, Propaganda Minister Goebbels shouted, "Fuehrer, we obey, listen to the Fuehrer's command!" (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

Berlin - The speech given by German Fuehrer Hitler yesterday was broadcast by sixty-seven radio stations and relayed to Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, Slovakia, Argentina, Uruguay, the United States, and Japan. It was broadcast in twenty-six languages, including Italian, English, Greek, Serbian, French, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Spanish, Portuguese, Flemish, Dutch, Danish, Arabic, Hindustani, and Malay.

### Japan Intensifies Economic Plunder of Dutch East Indies; Raises Several Important Demands; War About to Imminently Approach Malaya

London - According to reliable Dutch sources, the economic demands that Japan has made on the Dutch East Indies include laying a submarine telegraph cable connecting the Dutch East Indies and Japan, and establishing a regular air route between the Dutch East Indies and Japan. According to experts, the reason Japan insists on these demands is that Japan can use this to gain a favorable position in the Dutch East Indies. Dutch authorities here are very opposed to the principle of economic cooperation between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. In addition, it is reported that the demands also include Japan being able to obtain greater freedom in managing Japanese immigrants in the Dutch East Indies, allowing Japan to enjoy special interests in enterprises and mining, expanding fishing rights, and increasing imports of Japanese goods. The memorandum does not yet demand an increase in gasoline exports, but the Dutch side stated that when the oil agreement between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, which was established last autumn for a period of six months, expires, Japan may make this demand. (United Press dispatch, 31st) Batavia -范摩克, the chief representative of the Dutch side in the current Japanese-Dutch negotiations here, recently stated that he doubted the six-point secret proposal made by Japan to the Dutch East Indies, which was reported by the Moscow Radio Station at 波特. He also stated that he knew that representatives from both sides were keeping the current proposal secret. He said that he could neither confirm nor deny the information transmitted by the Moscow Radio Station. When reporters asked the spokesperson of the Japanese delegation, he said that he had no comment on the information. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

Batavaroa - 芳澤謙吉, the chief representative sent by Japan to the Dutch East Indies, declared yesterday to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka that he could not be responsible for what Matsuoka said about Japan intending to rectify the attitude of the Dutch through diplomatic protests. He also said that he was half optimistic and half pessimistic about whether the Dutch East Indies would accept Japan's proposals. He also said that Matsuoka's claim that the Dutch East Indies business community would supply Japan with large amounts of oil referred to the time when then-Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi came here, and did not involve the current new negotiations. 芳澤 also said that he hoped that the Dutch East Indies' reaction to Matsuoka's speech would not affect the smooth progress of the negotiations. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

Singapore - Sir 多瑪, the Governor of Singapore and High Commissioner of the Malayan Federation, said today that the war is already imminent on the coast of Malaya. Sir 多瑪 declared, "I am not exaggerating, nor am I a nervous person. I clearly tell you that this state may encounter a war, the value of which will be inestimable. If we do not acknowledge this and do not make full material and economic preparations as soon as possible, then we will be too optimistic." (United Press dispatch, 31st)

### U.S. President's Birthday; Broadcast Speech Says Americans Are Still Happier

Washington - President Roosevelt, on his birthday yesterday, said in a brief radio broadcast that this birthday was not entirely happy for him. Roosevelt said that in this period, no one in the world can be completely happy, but the American people are still living under the philosophy of a free nation, and their cities are not subject to blackouts like other parts of the world, which is commendable. Roosevelt also said, "We are not indifferent to the situation of free nations elsewhere because we believe in and insist on the right of the weak everywhere to survive. We instinctively recognize the rights of these unfortunates. Under our philosophy of a free nation, it is created by the whole people, not granted from above like an autocratic regime." President Roosevelt also expressed his gratitude to those who supported the anti-infantile paralysis movement he advocated. On the President's birthday, it has become customary for grand "President's Birthday Dance Parties" to be held throughout the United States and its territories. The proceeds are used to help those suffering from infantile paralysis, and most of them are used for patients in Warm Springs, Georgia. President Roosevelt himself recovered in that area when he suffered from the disease. (United Press dispatch, 30th)

### Philippine President Quezon Says the Philippines Can Only Rely on the United States; U.S. Defense Should Include the Philippines

嗚尼刺- Philippine President Quezon recently drafted a message from his sickbed to the Philippine Congress, saying that once war occurs, the Philippines will act in concert with the United States. Quezon said that national defense is the most important element of the Philippines, but due to lack of resources, the Philippines has to rely on the United States. The Philippines' affiliation with the United States is inevitable. As long as we are under the American flag, we will rely solely on the United States in peacetime or wartime. The Filipinos are prepared to take on all due responsibilities. The Philippines' manpower and resources are now at the disposal of the United States. The Philippine President also [missing character] that he has requested Washington to allocate the sugar tax and the funds that should be paid to the Philippines due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar to the Philippine national defense budget, and said that he hoped that the national defense program of the [missing character] country could include the Philippines. The defense of the Philippines is still the responsibility of the United States. (United Press dispatch, 31st)

Editorial

### Future of Industry and Commerce

The Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors are generally showing signs of prosperity and joy, having overcome the fourth financial accounting period during this time of national crisis. This is an undeniable harvest of deformed development. As the world situation is changing rapidly and problems are increasing, the future trend of various industries is indeed difficult to predict. However, based on a general observation, one can foresee that a normal future will inevitably be achieved amidst difficulties and dangers, eventually leading to brightness. This is because the prosperity or decline of the economy is an important factor in determining the victory or defeat of war, and the victory of war is an important driving force for promoting the prosperity of all industries. And everything in Shanghai changes with the fate of China. The ultimate success of China's resistance and reconstruction is self-evident, and the support from all directions for China's economy is already apparent. For example, the Soviet Union has consistently provided material assistance to China from the beginning to the present. And Britain, despite fighting a lonely battle, has realized that cooperation with China is mutually beneficial. As for the United States, if it wants to ensure the security of the Pacific and alleviate its concerns in the West, it will inevitably treat aid to Britain and aid to China equally. And President Chiang Kai-shek said that if the United States wants to avoid getting involved in the Far East vortex, it only needs to provide half the aid to China as it does to Britain. Therefore, purely from the perspective of the United States' own interests, it can be asserted that from today onward, the United States will inevitably provide substantial financial assistance to China. This is further evidenced by the fact that the representative sent by President Roosevelt to China is not a military or diplomatic personnel, but Dr. Currie, who is well-versed in finance, economics, and statistics, especially in "the supply and control of American currency." The significance and mission of this are even more evident. According to records, as of the beginning of this year, the United States' loans to China totaled approximately US$240 million. Most of this was handled by the Export-Import Bank and does not include the US$50 million in loans from the US Treasury to stabilize Chinese currency. The currency loan, the principles of which have long been determined, has been delayed because the United States is not hesitant about maintaining the Chinese legal tender itself, but is doing it for the sake of the Chinese legal tender. It must prevent all kinds of possible abuses before the assistance can achieve practical benefits, which requires serious consideration. Indeed, China's currency problem is not simple. It has a long history with British commerce, and it has a close relationship with the British pound when it switched to the legal tender. Therefore, if the United States provides strong support for the Chinese currency and agrees to take the same steps as Britain, it will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Although Britain is currently preoccupied with its own problems and is seeking assistance from the United States, it is unwilling to easily give up its old position in the Far East trade. It will ultimately unite its territories, combine with the United States, and provide all possible assistance to China. From this perspective, it is not an exaggeration to say that the Chinese economy has a superior and great environment and has optimistic conditions.

However, the meaning of general optimism does not mean being carefree. Taking the legal tender as an example, there are many considerations for those who seek to benefit it: First, one must avoid harming the innocent and must take into account the trade convenience of British and American merchants. Second, although the Shanghai market is still concentrated in a corner of the public concession, the internal conflicts and disputes are not easy to eliminate. Third, if the situation in Southeast Asia suddenly becomes tense, there are many doubts as to whether the status of British and American merchants in Shanghai can be maintained. Fourth, the clothing, food, and funds of the millions of Chinese residents living in the concession are almost all linked to foreign exchange. Therefore, the acquisition of foreign exchange and the exchange rate, whether long or short, will have a huge impact on general life, which must be taken into account. Therefore, even with the combined efforts of Britain and the United States, it is not an easy task to seek ways to benefit the legal tender without any drawbacks. Moreover, the exchange rate of the legal tender is irrelevant to its deep foundation; the gains and losses in one area are irrelevant to the overall international plan; therefore, the rise and fall of the exchange rate is not a barometer of Britain and the United States' attitude towards China. From the general optimism, we know that the future will inevitably tend towards brightness. However, in the instant before the realization of brightness, encountering storms and feeling dark, it is all within expectations. I hope that industrial and commercial companies will grit their teeth, operate cautiously, not speculate, and preserve the profits they have made in the past two or three years, so as to overcome the current possible difficulties first, and then broaden their horizons, relying on their profits to plan for normal development after the victory of the war. This is truly the best plan.

### ### Thailand and Vietnam Sign Armistice Agreement; Buffer Zone to be Established Between Locations of Both Armies; Three-Month Border Dispute Comes to an End; Japanese Urgently Hold Peace Talks in Tokyo

Tokyo:  The armistice agreement between Thailand and Vietnam was signed on a Japanese ship near Saigon this afternoon, bringing to an end the three-month border dispute between Thailand and Vietnam. According to an official announcement released tonight, the armistice agreement was reached at 8:00 PM today after a ceasefire conference was conducted on a Japanese warship near Saigon.  It was signed and sealed by plenipotentiary representatives from both sides and a Japanese representative.  A fundamental resolution to the border dispute will be discussed at a forthcoming peace conference in Tokyo.  According to Saigon sources, General Catroux, Governor-General of Vietnam, will be appointed as the chief representative to attend the Tokyo Peace Conference. The remaining representatives will be Captain Jon of the Military Bureau, Mr. Jenouvy of the Political Bureau's Diplomatic Section, and three others.  (Reuters, 31st)

Saigon: The Thai-Vietnamese armistice agreement was signed at 6:00 PM this afternoon on the Japanese warship "Natori". The agreement stipulates that both sides will withdraw their troops from the front lines and establish a 20-kilometer-wide buffer zone between the locations of the two armies. The period of implementation of the armistice agreement will last until the resolution of the Tokyo Peace Talks. After the signing of the armistice agreement, representatives from France and Thailand and Japanese mediators toasted with champagne to celebrate. The armistice agreement also stipulates that a buffer zone must be established within 72 hours, and the troops of both countries must withdraw 10 kilometers from their respective positions. However, even if the Thai army withdraws 10 kilometers, it still occupies a certain area of the Laotian province of Vietnam and some small areas of the Cambodian province, because the area occupied by the Thai army far exceeds the 10 kilometers of land withdrawn. The armistice agreement also stipulates that a boundary line shall be drawn in the Gulf of Siam, and neither the Thai army nor the French army shall be allowed to cross this boundary. Furthermore, aircraft from both Thailand and Vietnam must not fly over the buffer zone. The Thai and Vietnamese representatives accepted the Japanese proposal on Wednesday evening. The implementation of the armistice agreement will be supervised by Japanese representatives, and both Thailand and Vietnam must provide Japan with the necessary convenience. After the signing of the armistice agreement, public attention turned to Tokyo, because peace talks will be held in Tokyo soon. The fate of naval bases and airfields in southern Vietnam may be decided by Tokyo, because Japan and France are already holding meetings in Tokyo on Vietnamese economic issues. Sources with inside information say that Japan may demand naval and air bases in southern Vietnam as a reward for mediating the Thai-Vietnamese conflict. People close to the armistice commission said that Japan urgently hopes to hold peace talks in Tokyo as soon as possible. (Associated Press, 31st)

Saigon: Japan, Thailand, and France have organized a joint commission to discuss the Thai-Vietnamese armistice. The French delegation consists of five people: Mr. Catroux, head of the General Delegation of the Governor-General of Vietnam; Mr. Mantovani, Director of Civil Affairs; Lieutenant Joann, military attache to the Governor-General; Major Alexandre, Chief of Staff of the French Armed Forces; and Colonel Bellisair, Commander of the French Air Force.

Japanese Mediation Conceals Other Plans

Singapore: The special correspondent of the Free Press here recently stated that behind the Japanese mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese war, there must be a plot by the Axis powers. This plot may, in the near future, cause the European war to spread to the Far East. The special correspondent said that Japan is determined to control Thailand and Vietnam. The special correspondent also said that Malaya may be in real danger of war in the coming weeks. He also said that the development of the situation has become an attempt to flank and plan to occupy Singapore from the back door. Fortunately, the back door of Singapore has been strongly defended. There are often opportunities to advise Japan not to continue its plot, but at this time, Malaya is indeed feeling threatened. This is a dangerous imagination. (Associated Press, 31st)

### ### Japanese Forces in Guangzhou Bay Weak

Hong Kong: According to travelers arriving here from Beisha Fort (transliteration), the Japanese troops in Guangzhou Bay are limited to the Xiyin District (transliteration) where the customs inspection posts are located. Other areas remain as they were. However, smuggling is rampant, and the cost of living in isolated Guangzhou Bay is very high. Gasoline, which used to be imported from abroad, must now be supplied to the mainland. British ships no longer go to Guangzhou Bay, so there is a shortage of foreign goods. Although the Japanese naval inspection team is there, goods are still transported out of Guangzhou Bay and into the Chinese mainland. Anti-Japanese slogans have been removed, and Chinese newspapers have been discontinued. However, Chinese residents can still obtain newspapers from the mainland. According to the travelers, the French side has blockaded China, and China has imposed a counter-blockade on France. However, neither blockade has been effective, and goods continue to enter and leave Guangzhou Bay. Chinese customs still operate near Chikan in Guangzhou Bay under the orders of Chongqing. Due to the surveillance of both the Japanese and French sides, Chinese residents can only engage in business. As for pro-Chongqing elements, they have either left the area or remain silent. Rumors that the Japanese navy intends to seize Guangzhou Bay are inaccurate. Chinese coastal cities such as Dianbai, Yangjiang, and Wuchuan have been bombed by Japanese planes. It is said that an understanding has been reached between France and Japan not to interfere in the administration of Guangzhou Bay. (International News Service, 31st)

### ### Ministry of Communications Spokesman Discusses Plans to Improve Transportation; The Yunnan-Burma and Xukun Roads are Expected to be Completed Soon; Water Transport on the Sichuan-Hunan-Shaanxi Routes Will Be Improved

Chongqing: The spokesman for the Ministry of Communications briefly outlined the plans for improving transportation in China this year. Regarding railways, the railways currently in operation are the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Guangdong-Hankou, Hunan-Guangxi, and Longhai Railways. So far, they have all been used for military purposes. They are now being reorganized and will be available for commercial transportation soon. Although only the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is in operation, it is very important because it is used to transport rice and salt produced in the southeastern provinces. The Hunan-Guangxi Railway has been extended to Guilin and recently extended to Guizhou Province. The section of the Longhai Railway in operation is a section of about 100 miles east of Tongguan. After special arrangements, the railway will be unobstructed in the future. Even if Japanese troops bombard it across the river, there is nothing to fear. After the opening of the Burma Road, there is hope for the early completion of the Yunnan-Burma Railway and the Xukun Railway. Several sections of the two railways are expected to be open to traffic this year. Regarding highways, the authorities will devote all their efforts to improving them this year. The Yang (Rangoon) - Xin (Xinjiang) highway, which passes through Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, and Lanzhou, and the water transport on the Sichuan-Hunan and Sichuan-Shaanxi routes will also be improved. Bridges on the highways will be strengthened to reduce the number of ferries. Regarding aviation, American aircraft fly an average of 175 hours per month. Although China is at war, Chinese aircraft fly an average of 120 hours per month. This year, the goal is to purchase more aircraft. The China-India air route is currently under negotiation, and the Ministry of Communications is also planning to open an air cargo service. (Reuters, 31st)

### ### Japan Plans to Monopolize Vietnamese Products

Saigon: In response to the British government's approved boycott of Japanese shipping, Japan has prohibited Japanese ships from carrying goods from Vietnamese ports to foreign ports. The port authorities announced last week that goods from Vietnam carried by Japanese ships would not be allowed to be unloaded ashore. Japan's new ban will cause all kinds of Vietnamese products to belong entirely to Japan. It is reported that the French authorities in Annam have agreed to sell 700,000 tons of rice to Japan from this year's rice harvest, paying in Japanese yen, which cannot be converted into foreign exchange. It is also reported that Japan is planning to exclusively control Annam's rubber production, about 60,000 tons per year. However, it is currently facing opposition from rubber producers, because rubber has always been sold to the United States for better prices. If it is sold to Japan, the income will be useless paper without exchange value. Therefore, the French authorities have not yet been able to agree. (All China News Agency, 31st)

### Japanese Law Preventing Espionage; Extremely Strict Restrictions; Foreign Correspondents Will Find it Difficult to Obtain Information Hereafter

Tokyo: The bill for preventing espionage, which was submitted to the Diet yesterday by the Minister of Justice, will severely shackle foreign correspondents stationed in Japan. In addition to stipulating that it is illegal to publish or provide to foreign countries any information about diplomacy, finance, and economics that must be kept secret from a national defense point of view, the bill also imposes stricter penalties on various offenses stipulated in the Army and Navy Criminal Law, Military Secrets Protection Law, Military Resources Secrets Protection Law, and National Mobilization Law. Another feature of the bill is that if a person residing outside Japan commits the offenses outlined, he may be prosecuted once he is under Japanese jurisdiction. Article 8 is particularly strict, stipulating that anyone who disseminates any news unfavorable to Japan may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to ten years. Anyone who leaks state secrets to foreigners may be sentenced to death. The foreign Ministry spokesman, Ishii, stated this morning that if the new law is implemented, it will have the most impact on him. (Reuters, 31st)

Tokyo: The influential Asahi Shimbun supports the government's bill for national defense security and protection of state secrets, but it said that officials holding such secrets for any espionage offenses that leaked national secrets, the punishment is from imprisonment to the death penalty. Asahi Shimbun said that the reason for supporting the severe penalties stipulated in the bill is to learn from the fact that Germany's conquest of France was greatly aided by the fifth column. However, senior officials and authorities who are directly involved are the sole holders of important national secrets, so if there is any leakage, it is also their responsibility for negligence. The newspaper said, "If the government requires strict compliance with the law, then the government must also be extremely cautious. As for the definition of the highest state secrets, it should be approved and stipulated in advance by the heads of the various ministries. However, when applying it, the authorities must thoroughly study the relevant issues and must not treat loyal and good people as spies." (Associated Press, 31st)

### British Forces Capture Derna, Continuing Advance Towards Benghazi, Terrain Rugged, Mechanized Units Ineffective, South African Air Force Attacks Italian Positions in Abyssinia

London, Reuters Special Correspondent from the British Middle East General Headquarters reports: After capturing Derna, British forces are continuing their advance, but the terrain is becoming increasingly difficult. The open desert, which previously allowed for rapid advances by British mechanized units, is no longer present. Instead, the landscape consists of rolling hills. Most British mechanized forces are forced to remain on the main road between Derna and Benghazi. There are many locations where our forces can effectively resist, so the progress of the British forces will be slowed. One week after the British Imperial forces captured Tobruk, they occupied the small fishing port of Derna. British and Australian forces first occupied the outposts, then cleared out the last Italian resistance, driving out the Italian garrison. The Italian garrison numbered approximately ten thousand. Most may have already fled. The Derna area is larger and better fortified than Tobruk or Bardia. It has coastal artillery and anti-aircraft positions. Anti-aircraft guns are also positioned on the roads leading to Derna. Derna is one hundred miles west of Tobruk and has a good water supply. After the British captured Tobruk, they sent out patrols for continued rapid advancement, reaching the Gazala area, forty miles west of Tobruk, within two days. Although enemy planes attacked, they could not hinder the British mechanized forces. The Derna position did not have deep trenches, high ramparts, or permanent defenses. However, it is reported that the Italian forces there put up a stronger resistance than in previous battles along the coast. Their artillery also continuously bombarded British positions, but ultimately could not stop the British advance. (Reuters, 31st)

London, According to sources here, British forces are now advancing along the coastal road towards Apollonia, forty miles from Derna. There is no news yet on the number of prisoners and the amount of spoils captured in Derna. It is reported that Italian resistance is much stronger than before. This is not due to German assistance, but is actually due to fresh reinforcements. British forces are now continuing their advance, similar to the battles of Bardia and Tobruk, and are pressing towards Agordat and Barentu. The report that Italian forces on the Albanian front have withdrawn from Tepelene has not yet been officially confirmed here. (Reuters, 31st)

London, A dispatch from Nairobi reports that the South African British Air Force has launched successful attacks on Abyssinia for three consecutive days, inflicting great blows on Italian forces. The British aircraft themselves suffered no losses. As a result of the three days of attacks, a parking area for over one hundred and fifty vehicles in the Nichiri area was completely burned. The Yavello airfield was heavily damaged, with one Italian aircraft destroyed and several others damaged. Six Italian aircraft were also destroyed or severely damaged at Siassi Amanna, more than two hundred and fifty miles from the border. (Reuters, 31st)

### New Greek Prime Minister's Declaration: Following the Policies of the Late Prime Minister, Determined to Lead the Nation in Fighting to the End, Greek Forces Continue to Achieve Victories on the Albanian Front

He stated that the policies set by the late Prime Minister are the only path we must follow.

(Reuters, 31st)

London, Athens Radio announced that the Greek Information Department released a statement announcing that Greek forces have achieved further victories on the Albanian front, inflicting heavy casualties on Italian forces. The statement outlined the battles of the past twenty-four hours, stating that Greek forces in a certain area advanced and won, repelling the Italian forces and inflicting heavy damage. The Greek forces then attacked an important Italian military base. Greek forces on the northern front took important offensive actions, on a larger scale than local activities. In other areas, Greek artillery heavily bombarded the Italian reserve assembly points, inflicting heavy damage. In the area north of Klisura, Italian forces were forced to retreat, eventually finding themselves in a difficult situation. According to a dispatch from Athens in the "News Bulletin," the Italian losses in Albania have exceeded 60,000. (Reuters, 31st)

Athens, Army officials confirmed that Italian forces in Tepelene, an important town in central Albania, have been resolutely resisting Greek forces' fierce attacks for several weeks. (Editor's note: Reports several weeks ago stated that Greek forces had indeed occupied the town, but Italian forces subsequently recaptured it.) Now, unable to withstand the pressure from Greek forces, they are preparing to withdraw. The Army Department also declared, "In local battles, we have also been very successful, capturing several enemy positions and taking 200 enemy soldiers prisoner, including four officers." The Public Security Department reported, "All is peaceful within our country." A report from Budapest stated that Greek radio reported that Italian forces in central Albania have collapsed. Greek forces are approaching an important Italian base. Greek forces in the northern region have been able to withstand large-scale Italian attacks. (United Press, 31st)

### German Air Force Raids London All Day Yesterday

London, After enemy planes raided London on Wednesday night, more came to harass yesterday, causing continuous air raid alarms in London throughout the day. German planes harassed separately, dropping bombs in the London area and in various places in southeastern England and East Anglia, destroying some houses and shops. However, official sources stated that, as far as is known at present, the number of casualties is slight. During one air raid alarm, houses on three streets were damaged, and some women and children were trapped under the rubble, resulting in some deaths. One bomb hit near a tram line on a street, and another hit in front of an industrial building. Over Dover, German fighters repeated the old trick of last summer, shooting down some barrage balloons. There was heavy fog and low clouds under the balloons, so it was difficult to aim despite the intense anti-aircraft fire. In the afternoon, British fighters shot down a German plane in the skies over Essex. Enemy planes also sneaked in and dropped bombs in a town in the East Midlands yesterday, causing some damage and casualties. There have been no air raid alarms in London since dusk. (Reuters, 31st)

### Suez Canal Area Suffered Air Raid, Material Damage Slight

### U.S. Dignitary Willkie Inspects Dover Harbor, Meets with British First Lord of the Admiralty for Extensive Talks, Discussing the Entire Naval Situation, Roosevelt's Representative Hopkins Granted Audience with the King

London, Former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Willkie, while inspecting Dover Harbor today, twice witnessed anti-aircraft batteries firing at German Stuka dive bombers flying along the coast. During the first firing, Willkie was standing at the eastern end of Dover Harbor, only twenty miles from the German-occupied French coast. Willkie also inspected a long-range artillery battery. (Reuters, 31st)

London, Willkie, a former political opponent of U.S. President Roosevelt, is now in Britain gathering direct information on the current situation. Yesterday, Willkie took time out from his stay at the Park Lane Hotel to visit a public recreation area, where he played darts with the workers and toasted drinks with many soldiers on leave. Willkie then accepted the invitation of the innkeeper to enter the bar and drink beer and champagne, chatting and laughing with the waitresses. Everyone asked Willkie to sign autographs to keep as souvenirs, and Willkie obliged one by one. Afterwards, Willkie attended a small banquet hosted by Lord Mayor Seaman. After the banquet, Seaman led Willkie on a tour of the bombed-out London Cathedral. Willkie shook his head, saying, "The devastation is such that it is almost unbelievable. Destroying the cathedral is useless to the German war effort." Seaman then took out brandy from the undamaged cellar to drink. Willkie raised his glass and wished for "the restoration of the cathedral" before drinking it all in one gulp. Subsequently, Willkie visited the Admiralty and met with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Alexander. He encountered an air raid and was led into the basement. Afterwards, Willkie stated that he met with Alexander for half an hour and spoke with other officials, discussing the entire naval situation and what was urgently needed. Those who spoke with him were very candid, and he benefited greatly from the trip. Willkie also spoke about the small banquet with Lord Mayor Seaman, stating that they discussed the British court system and judicial matters under wartime conditions. His impression was that British courts are still open and free, and are operating according to long-standing regulations, which have only been slightly modified by wartime regulations. (Reuters, 31st)

London, King George VI received Roosevelt's personal representative, Hopkins, at Buckingham Palace yesterday. He had lunch with the King and Queen at the palace. This audience indicates that Hopkins' visit to England is coming to an end. The King will also receive Willkie, but the date has not yet been set. Willkie told people yesterday that he plans to leave England on February 6. (United Press, 31st)

### Soviet-German Border Agreement: Exchange of Ratification Documents

Moscow, It was recently announced here that the agreement on the legal status of the Soviet-German border has been ratified and ratification documents have been exchanged. On January 30, 1941, Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and Schulenburg, the German Ambassador, exchanged ratification documents for the agreement on the legal status of the Soviet-German border. The agreement was signed in Berlin on August 31, 1940, and included several appendices. The agreement is based on the Soviet-German Border and Friendship Treaty of September 28, 1939. (The Soviet-German Border and Friendship Treaty was ratified by both governments on December 5, 1940, and took effect on that day.) (TASS, 31st)

### U.S. Foreign Trade Increased Sharply Last Year

New York, In 1940, U.S. exports totaled $4,022,000,000, exceeding the 1939 figure by 27 percent. Imports totaled $2,625,000,000, exceeding the previous year by 12 percent. This was due to increased shipments to England and increased trade with South American countries. Industries benefited from this, while exports of agricultural products fell to the lowest level since 1869 in the second half of 1940. (Reuters, 31st)

International Anecdotes (2)

### The Secret of the Japanese-German-Italian Alliance

This is the third article in "Uncensored Report" by the American "Japan expert" Freda Utley, originally published in the New York Herald Tribune. A translation is provided below:

Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka once met with foreign journalists in Tokyo and told them that if the United States attacked Germany, Japan would fulfill its "glorious obligation" and fight against the United States, but only if the United States attacked first. This statement reveals a secret of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact of September last year.

Article 3 is the core of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact. It stipulates that if any of the signatory countries is attacked by a country that has not participated in the current European War or the Sino-Japanese War, they shall provide mutual assistance in political, economic, and military affairs. At that time, rumors circulated in Tokyo that there was an additional clause with a reservation nature to the treaty, used to determine whether a country had already been "attacked," thereby determining whether to participate in the war or not. But analyzing Matsuoka's statement, it can be seen that there is no such clause. If Germany and the United States were to go to war, Japan would first determine whether Germany was attacked by the United States before deciding whether Japan should participate in the war.

From the time the treaty was established, the signatory countries aimed to deal with the United States, never seriously paying attention to its application in Europe. To avoid mentioning the United States by name, they specifically marked "a country that has not participated in the current European War or the Sino-Japanese War." In addition, Article 5 stated that it had nothing to do with the Soviet Union, also clearing the Soviet Union.

Italy's invasion of Greece can be said to be the initial test of this treaty. This delicate incident made Tokyo silent. Japan apparently did not expect this treaty to apply to Europe. According to Article 3 of the treaty, it must first be determined whether Italy had been attacked by Greece in order to decide whether Japan should assist its Italian ally. On October 28 of last year, the Italian-Greek war broke out. On this day, Japanese morning newspapers paid attention to Japan's obligations under the Tripartite Pact, but by the time evening newspapers were published, not a word was mentioned about this obligation.

The Japanese government was completely embarrassed by this incident, feeling at a loss. If it was determined that Italy was the aggressor, it would offend an ally and lose any hope of asking for its help in the future. Conversely, if it was determined that Greece "attacked" Italy, then it would have to assist Italy in political, economic, and military affairs according to the treaty. As a result, it could only remain silent. Greek Minister to Japan Baritys was originally prepared to lower the flag and return home as soon as he received an expulsion order, but the Japanese government allowed him to continue in his post, and Greek merchant ships were also allowed to continue mooring in Japanese ports.

Many people in Japan have expressed dissatisfaction with this alliance from the beginning, but because the Emperor issued an edict when the treaty was established, expressing "satisfaction," it was unheard of in Japanese history for an edict to involve diplomatic affairs. Since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations seven years ago, this was the first time. How dare the general public openly criticize it, but they were all concerned and asking, what benefit is there for Japan to brazenly antagonize the United States?

The Japanese have never received a satisfactory answer to this question. But given the development of the Far East situation when the alliance was first established, namely Japan's advance into French Indochina, it showed the treaty's unknowable elements, making people believe that the scope of its inner workings was vast and would be revealed in the future.

Tokyo diplomatic observers believe that Germany has offered Japan the following quid pro quo:

(1) Japan can obtain a foothold in French Indochina.

(2) The French Concession in Shanghai may be transferred to Japan in accordance with the orders of the Vichy government when necessary.

(3) Germany assures Japan on behalf of the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union will remain neutral if Japan goes to war with the United States in the Pacific.

(4) Germany assures that it is "not concerned" about the Dutch East Indies, thereby hinting that Japan can confidently pursue its southward expansion policy.

The issue of Japan joining the Tripartite Pact has been debated by successive cabinets since the establishment of the Japanese-German Anti-Comintern Pact in November 1936. It was not until September 19, 1940, that it was decided at an Imperial Conference. At the Imperial Conference, the Emperor was heard to have expressed dissatisfaction, contrary to the usual practice of simply approving, and naval leaders also expressed dissent. It was only established due to the insistence of the military. Three days after the Imperial Conference closed, Japan advanced into Vietnam.

Japan had previously sent Major General Nishihara leading a military delegation to Vietnam, ostensibly to monitor and prevent military supplies from being transported to China via Vietnam, but in reality to present conditions to the French authorities in Hanoi and set a deadline for a reply by the evening of September 22. Under threat, the French signed an agreement with the Japanese at 4:30 pm on that day. Nishihara immediately dispatched an officer to Lang Son to notify Lieutenant General Ando, commander of the Japanese army in South China, that the agreement had been concluded, stipulating that 6,000 Japanese troops could enter Vietnam via Haiphong, and that the South China troops should not be moved for the time being. Ando believed that it was not his concern and that evening ordered his troops to enter Vietnam from Dong Dang, causing a conflict with the French army.

Upon hearing the news that Ando's troops had moved, Nishihara quickly dispatched another officer by plane to Lang Son in an attempt to stop his troops from advancing. The officer drove a car with a white flag, heading towards the Japanese army. The Japanese soldiers, seeing that it was a compatriot officer, gathered around and relayed Nishihara's intentions to the area commander. However, the commander claimed that he only obeyed the orders of Lieutenant General Ando and knew nothing else, ordering his troops to continue advancing. The French authorities then urgently telegraphed Ambassador Henry in Japan, instructing him to negotiate with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The Japanese used an imperial decree to directly order Ando to stop his advance, return the captured French military equipment, and bury the French soldiers who died in battle. Ando finally submitted to fate, ordering 2,000 of his troops to withdraw from Haiphong. Some of them were reportedly transferred to Hainan Island, and the rest were transferred to Taiwan. Ando was also recalled to Tokyo, relieved of his military command, and given an idle post in the General Staff Headquarters.

But the above incident is not enough to prove that Japan's advance into Vietnam was not a pre-planned scheme. The reason why the Japanese government prevented Ando from advancing was largely due to the German pressure behind the Vichy government.

In addition, after France was defeated, Japan requested the Vietnamese authorities to allow Japanese planes to fly to Thailand via Vietnam. The French had no choice but to accept, but later discovered that the French-German armistice agreement prohibited foreign planes from passing through Vietnam, and then notified Japan to cancel the original agreement. The Japanese were furious at France's double-dealing. As a result, the Vichy government finally agreed with Germany to allow Japanese planes to fly over Vietnam.

Hidemaro Konoye, Hitler's special envoy, played a major role in Japan's final entry into the Tripartite Pact. He visited Japan twice, in April and September of last year, acting very mysteriously. It was not until the establishment of the alliance that the newspapers revealed his name and mission. It is said that when this person passed through Moscow, the Soviet authorities assured him that the Soviet Union would remain neutral if Japan and the United States went to war in the Pacific.

As for Germany's attitude towards the Dutch East Indies, it had stated that it was "not concerned" as early as May of last year. At this time, it was still encouraging Japan's southward expansion policy, in order to divert the United States' attention from Europe to Asia, and to realize the purpose of the so-called Tripartite Pact to "restrain the United States from participating in the European War."

### Grain: 540,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Shipped to Shanghai in January, Prices Finally Fall After the Red Opening Day, Rice Prices Expected to Decline This Spring

The Xiaoguanghan Rice Market, after a week-long closure for the annual year-end settlement, reopened yesterday as usual. The red opening day was auspicious, and prospects for the people's food supply are reassuring. Rice stocks have increased by no less than 400,000 to 500,000 bags, and large quantities of futures continue to arrive. Nearly 300,000 bags have arrived in port within this short week of the new year. Adding in the stock in shops, the total is no less than a million bags. People's confidence is growing. The red opening of the morning market saw merchants thronging to display samples, with the market crowded and lively with sellers. The calls for bids were less confused and more distinct than last year's red opening. As for buyers, whether local shops or others, they had mostly stockpiled during the year-end settlement period, and according to custom, this new year would only be for some social business, so their appetite was limited. Now that supplies were abundant and sales were sluggish, sellers eager to sell lowered prices at each turn. As a result, transactions for various types of foreign rice were still not many, and the closing prices on the red opening day fell by 1.2 to 3 yuan compared to the last sales before the closure. New futures transactions saw sellers but no buyers. January 15th shipment futures closed at 81 yuan, early February at 83 yuan, and prompt delivery at 83.2 yuan, all about 3 yuan lower than before the holiday. The volume of spot rice transactions for the whole day was less than 3,000 bags, and the volume of original bags was 300 tons.

Although the sources of thick and thin japonica rice have not yet been fully cleared, the number of bags arriving in small batches during this holiday period was also large, so owners were quite willing to sell. However, because the flow of goods was flat, prices also fell by 1 to 2 yuan. Wuxi Yuanbai special japonica was priced at 106-7 yuan per unit, Kunshan Yuanbai special japonica at 103 yuan, ordinary at 100 yuan to 96-7 yuan, and Qingjiao thin rice at 94-5 yuan. The sales of glutinous rice were lively during this new year, but most of the purchases were in small quantities, so the market was only average, similar to last year. Hong Kong white was 77 yuan and 74 yuan.

The continuous arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai has been reported in this column. It is understood that the Jardine Matheson Line's Lesanglun arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 30th), carrying 1,250 bags from Hong Kong. Yesterday (the 31st) no rice arrived in Shanghai. For the month of January up to the 30th, the amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai was considerable. Each day, this column reported the amounts. Today, we provide a summary: a total of 539,266 bags arrived, of which 19,143 bags were shipped directly from Haiphong, 82,569 bags were shipped directly from Saigon, 24,436 bags were shipped directly from Siam, and the remaining 413,118 bags were transshipped from Hong Kong. It is reported that a large batch of Burmese rice is about to arrive in Shanghai, so there is absolutely no need to worry about the food supply for the city. It is also reported that the rice prices have already fallen by 2 to 3 yuan at the red opening of the market after the Spring Festival holiday. The sales in this street are also dull. (Zu)

### Flat Selling Price of Flour Set at 23 Yuan

Yesterday was the new year's red opening day for flour transactions. It has been decided that the flat selling price of flour from Chinese factories will be changed to 23 yuan, plus 0.3 yuan for miscellaneous expenses. The Fu and Fu factories will continue to supply as usual. The term will be determined after the arrival of foreign wheat next week. The price of foreign flour showed a smaller increase, as 30,000 bags of Australian flour had just arrived, and there were more than 200,000 bags in Shanghai's existing stock. In addition, with the decline in rice prices, it seemed difficult to be optimistic about the market. The market's buying and selling were mostly for red opening transactions. Kaihua, Bird, Zhonglou, and other brands of Australian flour were priced at 24.65 yuan, Huashen and Wild Boar brands at 24.85-95 yuan, and Red Sun at 24.7 yuan. More than 10,000 bags were transacted. Buyers all made inquiries. The agency price for this flour was 24.5 yuan, with about 3,000 bags sold by agencies and 6,000 bags sold in this street. Currently, the retail price of foreign flour of all brands in the flour shops is above 25 yuan.

There was no development in wheat yesterday. The supply of Du wheat remained scarce during the holiday. The stock in the Shanghai concession was only more than 2,000 bags, and holders were all speculating and raising prices. However, the market price of foreign flour at the red opening was mediocre, and the mills were sluggish in purchasing during the new year. Therefore, there were only calls for bids in the wheat market, and no formal transactions.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Raw Oil Most Expensive; Other Increases Limited

The market for miscellaneous grains, oil, bean cakes, and other similar goods has reopened yesterday after a nine-day holiday break. Trading started on a positive note, with most transactions being routine business. While prices were uniformly higher than before the holiday, there were no significant changes in the overall market. Miscellaneous grains and beans saw increases of one or two yuan, but the demand was weak, and the gains were not sustained. Transactions included over 700 bags of soybeans, 300 bags of green beans, over 100 bags of red beans, 100 bags of black beans, 150 bags of field peas, 130 bags of broad beans, over 600 bags of corn, 300 bags of sorghum, over 700 bags of mung beans, and spot sales of bean cakes. Due to the need to catch shipping schedules, the market for bean cakes was quite active, and prices rose by more than one yuan. Over 10,000 pieces of various bean cakes were traded. Futures trading, which is speculative in nature, reached over 30,000 pieces, with prices rising by 40 to 50 cents. Oil prices varied; soybean oil was affected by continuous dumping from Dalian, leading to weakened confidence and a softening trend. Transactions included 50 dans of oil from local factories, 300 barrels of spot oil from Dalian, and 500 barrels of futures. Peanut oil was influenced by the production area, with supply fluctuating, causing instability in the market. As a result, the overall market leaned towards gains. Yesterday's prices rose about ten yuan compared to before the holiday, but actual trading volume remained low. The results included transactions of 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 50 pieces of Yantai oil, 150 barrels of Qingdao oil, and 1,100 cans of Jiangbei oil. Today, 5,620 pieces of bean cake will be shipped to Hong Kong.

### Finance: Abundant Foreign Exchange Supply

The black market for foreign exchange saw alternating periods of tightening and loosening. It initially softened due to speculative traders and foreign firms settling accounts, but subsequently, Japanese firms sold and speculative traders also liquidated positions. After this, the supply was abundant, and the market trended towards easing.

Foreign Firms Settling, Japanese Firms Selling

The opening exchange rates at the bank for spot transactions were 3/8 39.0625 pence for British pounds and 5.40625 yuan for U.S. dollars. Compared to the closing rates of the previous day, both British and U.S. exchange rates rose by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively. However, shortly after opening, speculative traders started buying, and the banks, including the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) and a certain American bank, supplied generously, so there was little change in prices. Speculative traders bought U.S. dollars for February delivery at 5.375 yuan. When HSBC announced the rates at 9:30, all rates were stable, but foreign firms began to settle accounts again, causing the market to soften slightly. Foreign banks were only willing to sell U.S. dollars for February delivery to foreign firms at 5.34375 yuan. However, Japanese trading houses conversely sold, and the price softened further. Foreign banks absorbed February delivery at 5.375 yuan. Additionally, some speculative traders followed suit and sold, leading to a brief period of tightening. U.S. dollars for February delivery once traded at 5.40625 yuan. However, the market stabilized by the afternoon closing. The closing prices were 3/8 39.0625 pence for spot British pounds and 5.40625 yuan for U.S. dollars, similar to the opening prices.

British and U.S. Exchange Rates Both Loosened

The outlook for the market is calm. Speculative traders sold, and foreign banks absorbed all the offerings, but prices had already softened. Speculative traders offered U.S. dollars for February delivery to foreign firms, all at 5.40625 yuan. The closing prices were 3/8 39.0625 pence for spot British pounds and 5. yuan bid for U.S. dollars, with next month's rates at 3/8 35.9375 pence and 5.375 yuan respectively. Compared to the previous day, spot British pounds loosened by 0.015625, and U.S. dollars increased by 0.03125.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Fell After Rising

Hong Kong, January 31 (Friday) - This morning, the exchange market opened steadily. Except for the spot U.S. dollar, which tightened by 0.0625 to 23.875 yuan, all other rates remained unchanged. At 10:10 AM, the market was reported as stable. The spot Shanghai exchange rate rose by 1.50 yuan to 443.50 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the market was reported as stable, with no fluctuations in any exchange rates. At 2:30 PM, the market was reported as stable. The spot U.S. dollar increased by 0.0625 to 23.9375 yuan, and the spot Shanghai exchange rate fell by 3.50 yuan to 440 yuan. All other rates remained unchanged.

Tianjin U.S. Dollar Alone Tightened

Tianjin, January 31 (Friday) - Today, the exchange market opened steadily. The London telegraphic transfer rate remained unchanged at 3 7/8 pence. The New York telegraphic transfer rate tightened by 0.03125 to 5.90625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 0.25 yuan to 91.75 yuan. The "Joint Currency" on the black market also rose by 0.25 yuan to 80.05 yuan.

### Severe Cash Shortage: 70 Yuan Higher Than Futures

Yesterday, the gold market saw moderate activity on the black market, with relatively small fluctuations and a continued trend of indecisiveness. Prices initially rose before falling, causing the 6,700 yuan level to briefly be breached before returning. After foreign exchange shifted from loosening back to stable, and then hardened at midday, exchange houses bought and then sold again. The price saw 6,705 yuan, that immediately lead to decline. The price saw 6,625 yuan, eventually recovering to close only 2 yuan lower at 6,648 yuan. Based on the February U.S. dollar rate of 5.375 yuan, this equates to 6,479.1 yuan, a premium of 168.9 yuan. There were still 2,500 taels of January futures outstanding, and yesterday (January 31) was the final settlement day. All transactions were settled at the HSBC counter rate of 5.375 yuan for imported U.S. dollars, which translates to 6,479.1 yuan. Initially, Chen Da sold 30 taels to Cheng Ji at a premium of 40 yuan over the futures price. Subsequently, gold shops and brokers, backed by wealthy individuals, aggressively purchased, driving prices higher. Heng Ji sold 100 taels to Zhong Yu at a premium of 65 yuan and then sold 130 taels to Cheng Ji at a premium of 70 yuan. At midday, the price fell back, with sellers quoting a premium of 60 yuan. In the afternoon, prices continued to decline, and Xiang Kang Yong sold 50 taels to Bao Cheng at a premium of 45 yuan. Gold ornaments rose by 10 yuan to 690 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.

Moderate Decline of Two Yuan in Black Market

In the early morning, the exchange rates for British and U.S. currencies opened stronger, leading to a decline in market sentiment. Gold shops and exchange houses sold off positions before the market opened, initially pushing the price down by 10 yuan to 6,640 yuan. Subsequently, with the support of banks, prices gradually rose, and there were reports of a softening in foreign exchange, expanding the buying interest. Ren Cheng Yong and others aggressively bought, briefly pushing the price above the 6,700 yuan mark to 6,705 yuan. However, with the aggressive selling by the gold shops Da De Cheng and the coordinated selling by banks such as Da Feng and Tian Yuan, the price plummeted from its high. Initially, the price hovered between 6,670 and 6,680 yuan, but sellers were eager to sell, pushing the price down to a low of 6,625 yuan. Notably, Da Feng and others were short selling. Fortunately, several banks took advantage of the low prices and bought, pushing the price up by 30 yuan to 6,655 yuan. At this point, with foreign exchange still soft, the price struggled to rise further, and the market closed at midday at just 6,650 yuan. The market opened well in the afternoon at 6,660 yuan, but shortly thereafter, the exchange house Xin Feng sold, and Da De Cheng continued to sell off a substantial amount, causing the price to fall to the morning low of 6,625 yuan. Although the price rebounded later, it was difficult to sustain the gains. With slight purchases by Qian Dui Ye Bao Kang and others, the price briefly reached 6,650 yuan, but the closing price remained at only 6,648 yuan, a moderate decline of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 80 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold at the main gold shops was more than ten yuan higher than the black market price, while the buying price was 30 yuan lower, resulting in the gold standard being 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few actual transactions.

Gold Ornaments Increased by Ten Yuan

The selling price of gold ornaments at jewelry stores increased by 10 yuan at 10:15 AM, and remained unchanged thereafter. Da Tong Hang raised its price to 690 yuan, and the price at Xin Tong Hang was similar. The buying price was reportedly 30 yuan lower.

### Foreign Currency Stagnant

Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw a slight decline in black market prices. British and American gold pounds each fell by five cents, and the British gold pound tended to stagnate. The market price stabilized. American gold certificates saw minimal fluctuations, with sellers dominating, and the final price was 18.26 yuan, a decrease of six cents compared to the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong certificates remained unchanged, and the market price continued to rise by one cent. Japanese gold certificates returned to stability after rising, with the evening price still at 1.58 yuan. The demand for Korean certificates was not weak, and the market price rose sharply, reaching 1.23 yuan in the evening.

### Securities: After Dividend Payments, Public Bonds Suddenly Plummet; Another Old Rumor

The unofficial public bond market opened positively yesterday, in accordance to schedule. Due to the fact that the 31st was the day of dividend payment, the Class C bonds opened at a price of 68.7 yuan. At the same time, Kang Youwei bought and the market price lifted up to 9 yuan. As of then there were no rumors. However, Yu Xing, Da Hua, and Xin mistaken the news that the discount issue in Chongqing did not receive a reply, so they sold forcefully. Lian Yi, Zhen Ren, Chang Xin, Fu, and Xie Kang followed suit, so the market price declined in a straight line. Even though Lian He, Yi Zhong Sheng, Da, and Heng Fu bought, they were unable to stabilize the price. Taking the dividend payments into account, it should've been a rising wind. The result, aside from Class C, all other bonds showed signs of decline. After the market closed, it was discovered that the coupons had been received and the rumours were completely baseless. The informal bond market then rose a yuan. The market can be said to be disturbed by fools. Those who are calm bought low and reaped the benefits. These rumors seem to take place whenever dividend payments are approaching, yet they are always unfounded. Currently, the United States is stepping up efforts to actively aid China, and the atmosphere of peace is continuously being spread, even if it is unlikely to be realized. This would suggest that the other side is in a difficult spot. Given how favorable the current situation is, and how consolidated the finance is, yet the public bonds are declining, the writer understands that the bonds will increase in value greatly. The resulting differential caused by the dividend payments are 2.4 yuan to 3.1 yuan. 200 yuan was transacted. A concise table is listed below.

Starting yesterday, public bonds will follow the previous custom, with only the morning session open. The market will close after noon until the 10th of the first lunar month (February 10). After that, the market will be open for the entire day.

In regards to stock transactions, 100 shares of Xin Xin Co. were traded for 21 yuan.

London, January 30 (Thursday) - Today's listing prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far Eastern British stocks were stagnant. HSBC British-registered shares rose by one pound to 80 pounds. The rest were unchanged.

### Yarn and Cotton: Guangdong Traders Actively Buy Yarn, Market Rebounds

The yarn market, which was closed for six days, reopened as usual yesterday, and the trend continued to be positive. This was due to the active demand from Hong Kong traders, who were keen to purchase 32-count and 23-count yarn. Market sentiment was boosted, buyers were enthusiastic, and small banks were particularly keen to purchase. As a result, the yarn market recovered after a period of decline. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,439 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,427 yuan. The price for yarn to be shipped on Monday, February 3rd, was 1,443 yuan.

The opening trend for Double Horse yarn was peaceful, as market sentiment was largely cautious, with fewer people taking action. The opening price for Double Horse yarn was 1,435 yuan, rising slightly to 38 yuan. Subsequently, there were reports of inactivity in the outer market, leading to some selling and a decline to 1,427 yuan. However, with reports of increased demand from Guangdong traders and high prices for other brands of yarn, market sentiment was boosted, and the price rose again to close at 1,439 yuan, with strong momentum. It is estimated that 7,080 bales were traded in the morning session, with prices rising by 20 yuan. 210 bales of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong on February 1st. The amount of yarn purchased by each region is listed below:

Same Trade 5,350 Hong Kong 1,730 Total 7,480

### Spot Cotton Market Remains Firm

-Long Staple Fiber Most Popular-

The spot cotton market is showing a slightly firmer tone, as the yarn market is quite stable and so market sentiment is good, but the factory demand has not fully developed yet. The price of Indian cotton has slightly softened, and overseas purchases remain cheap, but there are fewer raw materials for fine yarn.

The New York cotton market trended firm due to frequent purchases by spot traders, followed by good trade in cotton cloth. As a result, the closing price was four to five points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market also increased by three rupees in forecast because yarn factories slightly purchased, as well as the covering of a few short traders.

Although only 600 bales were traded in Shanghai yesterday, all parties were sincere in their purchase of raw cotton, and long filament wool was particularly welcomed by factories. So the future of the cotton market is still optimistic.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Surges - Continuing to Rise

Yesterday's cloth market saw prices rise uniformly, with strong buying interest. The cost of raw materials and weaving is increasing daily, and the factories raised the price of each bolt by 0.5 to 1 yuan, which made everyone more confident. The various guest traders and local wholesalers all opened at higher prices. Compared with the price of cloth before the closure, the price of fine cloth increased 1 yuan per bolt, the price of coarse cloth increased 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per bolt, and the price of bleached cloth increased 1 to 1.5 yuan per bolt. About 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in this street. The Zhejiang, Wen, and Yong traders bought 170 to 180 pieces of fine cloth such as waterfall cloth, and the Jiangsu traders bought about 200 pieces of waterfall blue cloth. 885 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong today, and 4 pieces will be shipped to Siam.

Yesterday, the opening price of fine cloth, the leader of white goods, was 45.9 yuan. Due to more purchases and fewer sales, the closing price at noon was 46.4 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon, but the atmosphere was high and the goods were tight, and there was a trend of continuing to rise. The opening price of the Four Gentlemen bi ji was 1.28 yuan per bolt.

### North-South Goods: Gold Melon Seeds Rise Alone

The North-South Goods trade all had profits last year. But, in prudence, due to most of the goods having already reached a high price, the inventory settlement price was lower to lessen the risk. Yesterday, gold and black melon seeds and red dates were sold. Ding Zhuang mustard seed was 160 yuan, a rise of 20 yuan, Yang Hua mustard seed was 140 yuan, and Suqian mustard seed was 132 to 130 yuan. Common Zhong Xing mustard seed was 126 yuan, for a total transaction of 212 bags. Ji Kui black melon seed was 118 yuan, Ji Zhong black melon seed was 114 yuan, Tai Kui black melon seed was 110 yuan, Tai Yu black melon seed was 102 yuan, Ming Guang black melon seed was as high as 96 yuan, Zhong black melon seed was 92 yuan, and Ci black melon seed was 88 yuan, for a total of around 400 bags. 60 bags of Ji Yang unified hand black dates were at 67 yuan, and 20 bags of Chang Hong dates were at 26 yuan.

### Miscellaneous: Cigarettes Open with Price Increase

The cigarette factory line increased prices. The raw materials increased, so the factories revised the price. Yong Tai He Company's manager Old Knife cigarettes were 920 yuan, Pin Hai cigarettes were 870 yuan, Hartmen cigarettes were 870 yuan, Small Fairy cigarettes were 670 yuan, and Wu Hua cigarettes were 670 yuan. Zhuang Cheng Company's Small Beautiful cigarettes were 920 yuan, and Gold Mouse cigarettes were 920 yuan. All of them raised 20 yuan from the original price. Local traders added an additional yuan to every 50,000 cigarettes sold as a refugee donation.

### British and American Taxpayers Actively Support Additional Tax Plan: Special Meeting Decides on Full Attendance; Japanese Residents to Hold Meeting Today to Decide Attitude

Since the Japanese side announced that they would not participate in the special meeting of foreign taxpayers to be reopened at the Racecourse General Assembly at 2:30 pm on the 5th of this month, British, American and other foreign taxpayers in this port have been deeply stimulated. Yesterday, a British taxpayer told a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency that the actions of the General Assembly have left an indelible and bad impression on the minds of non-Japanese taxpayers. The purpose of intending not to participate today is to make the General Assembly not meet the legal quorum and postpone the meeting again. Little do they know that this move will unite British, American and other countries, and all will attend to strive for the passage of the motion, and crush the Japanese conspiracy to oppose the additional donations. It is actually an attempt to change the status quo of the concession. Regardless of whether the Japanese side decides to participate or not, British, American and other countries are determined to fight to the end.

The United Kingdom has Made Strong Representations

Reuters, London, 31st - Foreign Minister Butler replied to questions from Conservative MPs Milner and Galway in the House of Commons yesterday that Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, had made strong representations regarding the disorderly conduct of Japanese taxpayers in Shanghai, and urged that the appropriate punishment be given to the president of the Japanese Taxpayers Association, Lin Xiongji, who was shot and injured on January 23. The Japanese government agreed to send Lin Xiongji back to Japan for trial, and took various measures to prevent the recurrence of this unfortunate incident. In addition, he was happy to inform that Keziwei's injury was not serious. When Milner asked the question, he suggested that the British government should notify Tokyo that the Japanese side's request to increase the number of Japanese directors of the Public Works Department would not be supported by the British government. Milner also asked whether the Foreign Minister could guarantee that the British government would closely cooperate with the US government on all matters affecting relations with China and Japan. Butler replied that he had repeatedly stated in the past that the British government maintained contact with the US government on all matters relating to the common interests of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the British government still adheres to this policy.

Japanese Taxpayers to Meet Today

The Japanese Taxpayers' Standing Committee met at the Japanese General Assembly at 1:00 pm on the 30th and discussed for about four hours. They have not yet formally decided whether the Japanese taxpayers will attend the special meeting of foreign taxpayers of the Public Concession on February 5th. According to the Domei News Agency, the Standing Committee unanimously agreed yesterday afternoon to convene a general meeting of Japanese taxpayers on Saturday (i.e. today) in order to obtain a final decision on this issue. It is understood that the majority of the Standing Committee of the Japanese Taxpayers' Association supports Japanese taxpayers not attending the conference to be held at the Racecourse on February 5. If the Japanese taxpayers decide not to attend this conference, the Japanese Taxpayers' Association will send personnel to the meeting to observe. According to news from the English-language Da Mei Evening News, the Japanese Taxpayers' Association met at the Japanese General Assembly on the afternoon of the 30th and fully agreed to the resolution not to participate in the resumed meeting of foreign taxpayers of the Public Concession next Wednesday. It is heard that this resolution will affect all Japanese taxpayers, based on the fact that the Japanese completely oppose the Public Concession's proposed increase of 40% in donation taxes and license fees.

British and American Numbers Are Sufficient for Quorum

The Public Works Department believes that even if the Japanese do not participate, it will not affect the quorum of the conference, because taxpayers from the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries may all participate. The number of people at the conference can reach more than 9,000, accounting for more than half of all qualified votes. The motion is absolutely effective, so preparations are still being actively made to reopen the conference on February 5 to resolve the additional donation case as soon as possible and reduce the current financial difficulties. In recent days, the venue has been renovated and newly printed ballots have been reissued. All taxpayers must enter the venue with a ballot. These new ballots will be issued before the 3rd of this month. If a taxpayer has not received it by 2:00 pm on the 4th, they can go to the Public Works Department Donation Office at 209 Jiangxi Road or call 12810 ext. 29 to contact them.

### Various Opinions on the Additional Donation Case

Yesterday, a certain Westerner sent a letter to the reader's mailbox of the Zi Lin Western Newspaper, stating that the main reason for the Public Works Department to increase donations is actually that the Japanese army collects heavy taxes on any goods entering and leaving Shanghai. People in Shanghai have rarely paid attention to this matter in the past, which is surprising. The current price of rice is six times higher than in peacetime. Why is that? The prices of cotton, wheat and eggs have all increased. Why is that? The reason for this is that the Japanese side levies taxes on these important items. The legal taxes collected by the Public Works Department are nothing compared to the illegal donations and taxes collected by the Japanese army. However, Mr. Lin Xiongji is still tirelessly criticizing the 40% tax increase, which is really inconsiderate. Mr. Lin should do his best and ask his country's authorities to allow supplies to enter and leave the concession freely, and all economic problems can be solved easily.

Another Foreigner Says the Bureau is Improper in a Letter to Zi Lin Western Newspaper, Shanghai's high cost of living is caused by both the Japanese and the Public Works Department. When the price of rice first rose, the newspapers advocated that the Public Works Department should take action. In 1937, the Public Works Department had the right to purchase and distribute rice. If the bureau had taken such actions at that time, it could have been done in the future. If so, the companies could purchase rice in advance to meet the monthly needs of their employees, and the employees of the Public Works Department could also enjoy this benefit and would not be affected by the high price of rice. However, the Public Works Department did not plan for this, and repeatedly increased the living allowances and rice subsidies of its employees. As the Public Works Department increased subsidies, rice merchants took the opportunity to raise rice prices, and the Public Works Department had to increase taxes. The two are like a cycle, and the one who started it is the Public Works Department itself. If the Public Works Department could purchase rice in advance and distribute it, the situation would never have reached this point, because not only would the price of rice not rise, but the prices of other foods would not be as expensive as rice.

Difficult to be Fair Yesterday, a Westerner named Demitraddes also sent a letter to Zi Lin Western Newspaper, commenting on the inappropriateness of the current license fees of the Public Works Department. The letter stated that the Public Works Department only collects license fees from restaurants, beverage stores, building materials, contractors, various vehicles and drivers. The license fees they pay account for almost 90% of the total amount, while other industries, professions and businesses pay only one yuan for license fees. Some businesses do not even pay this paltry one yuan. As a result, the license fees paid by a rickshaw driver are even greater than those paid by a pharmacy or a bank that makes a lot of money every day, which is really puzzling. Why does the Public Works Department charge license fees for daily necessities and exempt license fees for luxury goods? Why does a rickshaw driver taste foreign ham all day long, while a banker is protected? After carefully reading the Chinese directory and telephone directory, I believe that if the Public Works Department levies taxes on unlicensed businesses, it will not be difficult to raise 2 million yuan.

### Authorities Maintain Sufficient Grain Reserves, Guarantee Stable Rice Prices, 500,000 Bags of Vietnamese Rice to Arrive in Port Soon, Public Warehouse Regulations Officially Announced

Shanghai Times reported that a senior official of the Public Works Department, who also holds an important position on the Rice Evaluation Committee, claimed yesterday (30th) that the large amount of foreign rice that has arrived in Shanghai and will be shipped here is the best guarantee for the people's food in Shanghai. More than 500,000 bags of Saigon rice and Yangon rice are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai within the next six or seven weeks, which will inevitably cause rice prices to fall. The authorities are also working hard to curb the hoarding and manipulation of rice, and have achieved good results. Moreover, the sufficient rice reserves in the city will reduce the motive for rice merchants to engage in hoarding and other activities. At the same time, steps are being taken to establish public warehouses as soon as possible to the greatest extent possible. This move will have the effect of stabilizing rice prices. However, no action has been taken on the official recommendation of the Public Works Department Food Committee to the Evaluation Committee to reduce the price limit.

Replenishing Rice Reserves is Most Important

The sufficiency of rice is more important than abstract control. The best way for the authorities to guarantee the people's food is to maintain sufficient rice reserves and closely investigate market transactions. The public concession and the French concession authorities have a complete understanding of this to ensure the stability of the food situation in the two concessions.

The Amount of Rice Arrived is Alarming

Since the recent month, foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai one after another, in alarming numbers. The past daily arrival volume has been disclosed in the commercial news column of this newspaper every day. Jardine Matheson's Lisheng Wheel docked in the evening of the 30th. It was learned yesterday that 1,250 bags were also shipped from Hong Kong. Up to that ship, the total amount of foreign rice that arrived in Shanghai in January was 539,266 bags. There is still a large number of Siamese and Vietnamese rice, and rice from various parts of Burma, continuing to be shipped here. The people of this city can rest assured about food. Rice prices saw a small increase yesterday after the Spring Festival holiday, and sales in this street are also stagnant, with a tendency to continue to decline.

Separate Regulations for Rice and Grain Commissions

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association issued a notice yesterday, stating that "It has been found that the commission rates for rice issued by colleagues in this street are quite different, which is prone to malpractices. It has been decided by the Executive Supervisory Committee of this association that from January 31st of this year, the commission rate for both domestic and foreign rice will be uniformly set at 5 jiao per shi, and various fees will be added separately. In addition to reporting to the authorities of the two concessions and writing to the Rice Industry Association, this is hereby recorded and publicly announced." In addition, the Rice Market Management Committee announced, "The annual meeting of the City Market Management Committee decided that various fees should be added separately. The resolution temporarily stipulates as follows: 4 jiao will be added to each bag in Pudong, and 1 jiao will be added to each bag in Puxi and Hongkou. If the goods are shipped by ship in Hongkou, 4 jiao will also be added to each bag. In addition to writing to the Bean and Rice Industry Association for endorsement and forwarding to the authorities of the two ancestral circles for filing, this is hereby publicly announced for information." In addition, the commission for retail sales of rice per shi is 1.5 yuan, in accordance with the regulations of the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee.

Public Warehouse Regulations Officially Announced

### The So-Called West District Police Rights Agreement Was Signed This Morning: The Full Text of the Agreement Will Be Released After Signing

According to a public announcement by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office: "The Shanghai West District Police Rights Agreement is scheduled to be formally signed at 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 1st) at the Shanghai Municipal Government in the city center. The full text of the agreement will be released after signing."

Negotiations of More Than a Year Finally Reach a Compromise

According to a report in the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", officials announced yesterday (the 31st) that the interim agreement on police affairs in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area, after approximately one year of negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government," will finally be signed at 10:00 AM this morning (the 1st) in the city center. The signing representatives for the "Municipal" side will be Chen Gongbo, and for the Shanghai Municipal Council, it will be Keswick. It is said that this police affairs agreement is beneficial to the Public Concession authorities, as it stipulates the dispatch of a large number of foreign police officers to serve in the jointly administered Extra-Settlement Roads Area. The details of the agreement will be announced after signing tomorrow. According to the original agreement on the Extra-Settlement Roads Area, it was signed between the then-Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Fessenden, and Fu Xiao'an in February of last year. It is expected that after the West District Police Affairs Agreement is signed today, the two sides will soon hold a meeting to discuss the issues of tax collection in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area and the jurisdiction of the Chinese courts within the Public Concession.

It is Rumored that the Tax Revenue Issue Has Also Been Resolved

It is understood that after the signing of this police rights agreement, the two major issues that were not resolved in last year's interim agreement are expected to be resolved comprehensively: (1) Organize joint police rights to "manage" the Extra-Settlement Roads Area; (2) Establish an independent tax collection agency in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area to collect donations and taxes. It is recalled that Chen Gongbo once told Western reporters a month ago that this tax revenue would be used to maintain joint police rights and other expenses in the area. This organization, similar to the joint police force, is jointly administered by both parties but is under the jurisdiction of the "Municipal Government." If the collected donations and taxes are insufficient, they will be subsidized by the "Municipal Government." However, it is claimed that if there is a surplus, it will not be handed over to the "Municipal Government" but will be used for the development of the Extra-Settlement Roads Area.

Past Disputes Occurred Frequently

On the morning of October 20, 1939, the relationship between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" reached its most dangerous point. At that time, the "Municipal Police" attempted to threaten and occupy the traffic posts on YuYuan Road between Yidingpan Road and seize police rights. This happened twice without success. Then, five plainclothes officers were dispatched, armed with firearms, to attack the patrol officers stationed there, resulting in the death of one Chinese patrol officer and the injury of one Indian patrol officer. In order to use violence to force the Shanghai Municipal Council to compromise, they made a further shocking move on January 6, 1940, attempting to harm Mr. Phillips, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Although Philips' car was hit by multiple bullets, he escaped unharmed. However, negotiations between the two sides continued, and an agreement was finally signed on February 16.

The Shanghai Municipal Council Recommends Police Officers

The regulations of this agreement stipulate that police officers in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area are recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council, and foreign police officers are appointed by the "Municipal Government." The head of police rights in the area is appointed by the "Municipal Government" from the candidates recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Shanghai Municipal Council then appoints liaisons to cooperate with the police rights in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area. If there are differences of opinion among officials, they should consult the "Director of the Municipal Police Bureau" and the Commissioner of Police. As for the number of police officers, it is not specified, only stating that it "will be decided after further negotiations."

### The Shanghai Municipal Council Published Last Year's Shanghai Living Statistics: Workers' Living Expenses Increased Again in January This Year, and the Purchasing Power of National Currency Decreased to Slightly Over Sixteen Cents

(Continued from yesterday)

Real Wages

In factories established by Chinese, it decreased again this year. Taking 1936 as 100, the real wage index is 55.33, while it was still 58.59 last year. The so-called real wage refers to the purchasing power of actual income, in relation to changes in prices. The calculation method of the real wage index is to divide the actual income index by the cost of living index. Therefore, the real wage index has dropped from 58.59 last year by another 3.26 points to a low of 55.33. From this, it can be seen that although workers' incomes have increased, this year's living conditions are more difficult than last year.

Workers' Living Expenses in January

In January of this year, the cost of living for workers in this city increased again. The total index was 597.19, an increase of 17.49 points compared to December of last year, or 3.02 percent. The purchasing power of national currency decreased from 17.22 cents last month to 16.75 cents. The food index was 674.62, an increase of 13.40 points compared to December. The rent index was 385.26, an increase of 37.07 points. The clothing index was 432.44, an increase of 13.72 points. The fuel index was 563.05, an increase of 11.19 points. The miscellaneous items index was 497.18, an increase of 238 points.

Situation of Rice Although the situation of rice has improved, general prices in this month are still trending upward. Although the average price of rice in January was higher than last month, since the rice price evaluation committee re-limited prices on the 9th, prices have begun to fall back. Imported rice has arrived in large quantities, and hoarders are also in urgent need of cash. Compared with last month, flour increased by 16.16 percent, so the price of sliced noodles also increased by 21.3 percent. Due to the New Year holidays, prices of salted pork, duck eggs, and soybean oil have risen again. Vegetables such as green vegetables, spinach, and white radishes have decreased significantly, and fresh fish is also lower due to increased supply.

Rent Situation Rent is investigated and decided every six months. The first investigation this year was held in January. Among the families surveyed, 34.43 percent had increased their rent since July of last year. Rents for bungalows increased by 3.84 percent, houses without courtyards increased by 9.61 percent, and houses with courtyards increased by 24.94 percent. Houses of better quality have increased more.

Clothing and Other Items Clothing prices have also generally increased, ranging from 0.81 to 15.06 percent. Homespun cloth has increased the most. Among fuel items, coal balls have increased by 5.91 percent, kerosene has increased by 11.45 percent, and matches have increased by 23.76 percent. In the miscellaneous items category, outside of boiled water and tea, which have not changed, the rest have increased by 3.62 to 14.37 percent. In the index of 58 items, 37 items were higher in price than in December of last year, 15 items were lower, and 6 items remained unchanged.

### Vietnamese Delegation to Japan Passes Through Shanghai and Makes a Statement: Confirms that France Will Definitely Restore Pétain

Havas News Agency Local News: Nguyen Dinh Luan, former Minister of Information of the Annam Imperial Court and private secretary to the Annam Empress, was recently appointed as one of the French representatives for the French-Japanese economic negotiations on Vietnam and has recently arrived in Shanghai. He is scheduled to stay for a few days before going to Tokyo to participate in the negotiations. Mr. Nguyen made the following statement yesterday at the French Radio Station in this city: "When France joined the Second European War, we firmly believed that it would be victorious. However, it suffered a disastrous defeat, which was truly unexpected. Although France has suffered defeat, our loyalty to France has never changed. I dare say that we have never had a moment of disloyalty. France has always treated us with leniency and has never infringed upon our will or cultural heritage. This is why we love France. Although it is now facing misfortune, it will definitely restore its greatness in the future, which can be asserted. As for us, the only thing we can do is to share its pain and assist in its reconstruction. In short, we must support Marshal Pétain. Marshal Pétain's plan to reform and revive France is based on the theory of three major elements, including work, family, and motherland. We know this principle very well, because the Annam nation lives and breathes in a family atmosphere, and what it usually admires most is order, government, and power, which Marshal Pétain already possesses. His Majesty Emperor Bảo Đại of our country expressed his admiration for Marshal Pétain at the beginning of his administration, which is of great significance. In addition, when His Majesty held grand ceremonies in the palace, he repeatedly stated that the people must sincerely support the leader's reform plan and his authority. His admiration for the Marshal can be seen from this. As for Vietnam, it is currently very peaceful, with good order and a prosperous economy. Goods are being exported as usual. The people of Vietnam know that in the midst of this world turmoil, they are fortunate to be spared, which is a great blessing from heaven. They also know that the French government will never disregard the people of Vietnam, so their only hope is to continue to live and work in peace under French protection. We look forward to the future with great confidence."

### Former Japanese Minister of the Navy, Osumi, Arrives in Shanghai

Japan Again Blocks Bridges

Former Japanese Minister of the Navy, Admiral Osumi, is currently visiting Shanghai. The Japanese blocked the bridges over the Hongkou and Suzhou Rivers leading into Hongkou from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM yesterday (the 31st). Osumi will stay in Shanghai for a few days before returning to Japan.

### Municipal Council Elections

The upcoming elections for the Shanghai Municipal Council are expected to be more intense than the last, as the Japanese side is attempting to undermine the status quo of the Public Concession and disregarding the gentlemen's agreement that the proportion of councilors from Britain, the United States, and Japan should be 5:2:2. However, judging from the current situation of the foreign ratepayers' special conference, it is undoubtedly that Britain and the United States still have the upper hand. The Shanghai Municipal Council authorities have chosen April 10 (Thursday) and April 11 (Friday) as the dates for the council elections, and are now submitting them to the Consular Body for review so that the Consular Body can issue a notice for public knowledge. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Revenue Department is currently rushing to compile a register of foreign ratepayers' names.

### Primary Postal Clerk Exam Papers to be Released in Early March

The Shanghai Postal Administration held the Primary Postal Clerk Examination on October 19. All 10,318 exam papers, with a total of 1,474 participants, require time for detailed review due to the large number of participants. The rumor that they will be released soon is inaccurate. According to a reporter's investigation, the Shanghai Post Office, due to the Lunar New Year holidays, has requested the examiners to start grading the papers at the office yesterday due to their busy schedules. The initial review period is 10 days. After the review and a two-week second review, all scores are expected to be finalized by the end of this month. The release date will be in early March.

### Westerner Argues with Military Officer Over a Woman, Attempting Suicide by Shooting: Rival Encounter Leads to Argument, Goes to Friend's Place to Discuss, Shoots Servant

William John Cruz, a Westerner without consular jurisdiction (an unrecognized American who works as a clerk at the East Asia Transportation Company at 17 Guangdong Road, residing at 1, Lane 156, Goubert Road, French Concession), was in love with and engaged to a Western woman named Kempe. However, Cruz recently learned that his fiancée had a relationship with U.S. Navy Lieutenant Robert Wilkie, causing him great mental distress. At 5:10 PM the day before yesterday, Cruz saw his fiancée walking with Wilkie on Route des Soeurs, and he could not help but feel jealous. They argued on the street. Later, because they and a Western detective named Baden from the Central Police Station (who resides at Room 4B, Bank of China Building, 80 Jing'an Temple Road) were all friends, they went to Baden's residence to discuss the matter. At that time, Baden was about to go to the police station to work, so while he was putting on his uniform, he placed his duty pistol on the table. Unexpectedly, Cruz suddenly grabbed the gun, loaded it, and fled into the bathroom. Baden chased after him, but the bathroom door was already closed. While Cruz's hand holding the gun was being blocked by the door, a gunshot suddenly went off. The Western's Chinese servant, Shen Changfa, was hit, and his legs were injured and he collapsed to the ground. As a result, Cruz's gun was taken away. The Chengdu Road Police Station, hearing the noise, sent Western detective Tuiller to investigate. In addition to sending the injured person to Baolong Hospital for treatment, they took Cruz into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, presented the case, requesting that he be held in custody. When questioned, Cruz confessed that the purpose of grabbing the gun was to commit suicide. He hired lawyer Wang Yaotang to appear in court and request bail. The police station did not object. Judge Liu ruled that Cruz was granted bail of 500 yuan and released from custody. The case was adjourned for seven days for further review.

### Western Woman Falls From the Eighth Floor of the Washington Apartments

### Accused of Assault for Claiming Patrolman Harassed Woman

Conflict Over Boarding a Public Bus, Husband, Wife, and Concubine Fined The Zhejiang native, Li Wen, residing at 66 XinZha Road, currently works as a broker at the exchange. At 10:15 PM the night before last, he was with his wife, Li Wang, and his concubine, Li Bao, leaving Qi's house and waiting for the No. 10 public bus at the intersection of Connaught Road and Gordon Road. At the same time, Chinese patrolman Chen Shizhen, No. 2144 of the Shanghai Municipal Police, was also waiting for the bus at the same place. Due to the rush to board the bus, the patrolman's hand touched Li Wang's hair. Li immediately accused the patrolman of harassment and began to scold him, leading to a dispute. The couple and concubine surrounded and beat the patrolman, causing him minor injuries and damaging the belt on his uniform. The whistle was lost. When the bus arrived at Route des Soeurs, the patrolman summoned Chinese patrolman No. 13 to help, and together they detained Li and his family at the Gordon Road Police Station. Li and his family were violent towards the patrolman. After investigation, it was determined that Li and his family had committed a joint assault and were taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. The police lawyer, Peng Qixin, prosecuted them for assault and stated that Li Wen had previously been arrested for political reasons but was not prosecuted. Li Wang had been fined twice by this court for soliciting prostitution. When questioned, Li and others stated that the patrolman had harassed them first and then severely beat them. After questioning by Judge Zhan Liangce, Li Wen was sentenced to a fine of 60 yuan, and Li Wang and Li Ju were each sentenced to a fine of 40 yuan. If they were to serve labor service, it would be calculated at 2 yuan per day.

### Judge of the Civil Division of the Senior Second Branch Court, Luo Chongtai, Passes Away

Luo Chongtai, also known as Yunbo, the current judge of the Civil Division of the First Branch Court of the Jiangsu Senior Court, was 54 years old this year. He was originally from Jurong, Jiangsu, and resided in Jinan. His Shanghai residence was at 30 Cihou North Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, Hartung Road. Luo originally suffered from heart disease, which came and went. On the first day of the Lunar New Year this year, at around 11:30 PM, Luo ordered his servant to spread out the bedding, turned off the lights, and went to bed. Although Luo went to bed, he did not take off his clothes, but lay down on the bed. Half an hour later, the servant found Luo lying stiffly on the bed, lifeless. He rushed to inform the mistress. Mrs. Luo was playing mahjong and, upon hearing the report, ordered people to look for a doctor everywhere. However, due to old customs, most doctors were unwilling to make house calls on the first day of the New Year, and it was also late at night, making it even more difficult to find a doctor. Moreover, heart disease could not be treated by ordinary doctors. It was not until around 2:00 AM that a doctor was found, but it was too late to save him. Luo passed away. His body was placed in a coffin at the Central Funeral Home the other day. The president, chief, judges, and prosecutors of the Senior Court and the Special First District Court all went to offer condolences. Luo graduated from the Beijing Judicial Training Institute and was a classmate of Feng Shide, the current presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Shanghai Special First District Local Court. During the Beiyang government era, he served as a judge in the Shanxi Higher Court and the Local Court. Later, he followed Xu Weizhen, the then-president of the Senior First Branch Court, to serve as a judge in the Provisional Court. When the Provisional Court was reorganized into the Special First District Court, Luo served as a judge in the Criminal Division of that court, and later transferred to the Civil Division. He later transferred again to the Civil Division of the First Branch Court. Luo had been a judge for more than a decade and had no savings. He had no children and only one wife. It is said that Feng Shide and others, recognizing that Luo had been a clean and upright official and had a meager estate, planned to jointly petition the Ministry of Justice to grant him a posthumous pension.

### The Ministry of Education Rewards Guidance Personnel, Orders Compliance with Regulations on Vacation Procedures, One Year of Vacation Granted after Nine Years of Continuous Service

Regarding education matters in this city, yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued an order to reward guidance personnel in secondary schools. It instructed compliance with Article 113 of the revised secondary school regulations and Article 114 of the revised normal school regulations. Those who have served continuously for more than nine years, have outstanding performance, have not taken vacation for further study, and have reported to and been filed with the competent educational authority, may take one year of vacation for further study. Regarding this matter, yesterday a copy of the original text was made and forwarded to all schools for compliance. The original document will not be sent separately. It is transcribed below:

Ministry Order Original Text: It is noted that at the Guidance Conference convened by the Ministry this year, it was resolved that "to reward the work efficiency of guidance personnel, those who have worked in schools for more than five years should be given an opportunity of one year or half a year to investigate the actual conditions of guidance in various regions and schools, or to be assigned to study issues related to guidance." Furthermore, it is noted that the Ministry, in order to provide teachers who have served for many years with the opportunity to leave school for research or investigation to conduct more in-depth research, stipulated in Article 113 of the revised secondary school regulations and Article 114 of the revised normal school regulations that secondary school teachers who have continued to serve in a school for nine years or more may take one year of vacation to engage in research and investigation. However, the work of guidance personnel in various schools is heavy and busy, and they rarely have the opportunity to enjoy regular holidays for rest and recuperation like other teachers. If they have served for many years and are not given the same treatment as leaving school for investigation or research, it may be difficult to expect them to further their studies. Now, in order to encourage the service enthusiasm of guidance personnel in various schools and improve guidance efficiency, guidance personnel in charge of secondary schools who have been reported to and filed with the competent educational authority shall be allowed to follow the provisions of Article 113 of the revised secondary school regulations and Article 114 of the revised normal school regulations for further study in order to enhance guidance efficiency. It is hereby ordered to be forwarded for compliance. (Dahua News Agency)

Profession

### What is Expected of Doctors

— Qiren

Nowadays, commercialized doctors not only refuse to serve the public proactively, but even with a hefty price, they are unwilling to fulfill their due responsibilities. For example, I once suffered from tuberculosis of the lower limb joints. Impressed by the fame of a certain Western doctor, I entered his hospital and was treated by him. However, due to his dereliction of duty and the negligence of his assistant, my condition suffered unnecessary expansion (due to improper application of a plaster cast, another joint was injured), leading to a tragic outcome - disability. My family strongly opposed my seeing that particular doctor. However, because I believed in new doctors and trusted that he was capable and moral, I mustered unprecedented courage to enter his hospital. The result was such that the spiritual blow I received was imaginable! There is no need to talk about these painful old events. What I want to say now are my two hopes for doctors.

Due to the lack of public health knowledge in our country, the general health condition is very poor. Therefore, it is an urgent task to instill disease and health knowledge to the public. In addition to efforts in school education and social publicity, doctors provide the best opportunity for publicity during the diagnosis. A doctor's responsibility should not only be to treat people's diseases but to make patients understand the cause and content of the disease, which is also an important secondary duty of the doctor. This not only allows patients to prevent future illnesses by understanding the cause of the disease but also helps with the treatment. Because the disease is on the patient's body, only the patient's feeling about the disease is most genuine. If the patient understands the location and content of the disease, they can pay attention to it at any time, avoid it, and take reasonable measures other than medicine. This can prevent the disease from branching out and promote the restoration of health, which is convenient for both doctors and patients. However, most doctors still hold the old bad habits of traditional doctors, keeping the skills secret. They are not only unwilling - maybe they disdain - to automatically explain the disease to the patient, but they are also reluctant to teach even when the patient asks. I stayed in the hospital for more than half a year, and I didn't even know what disease I was suffering from. I repeatedly asked the doctor and his assistant what disease I was suffering from. They always said bone tuberculosis. When I asked them the cause of the disease, they said it was weakness. Naturally, the disease always arises from weakness, but this is only an indirect cause and not a direct cause. At that time, I didn't know that tuberculosis was the common name for tuberculosis. If I knew that my disease was joint tuberculosis, I would understand the seriousness and long-term nature of the disease and pay more attention to it. Then I believe that my disease would not have fallen into such a tragic situation!

In addition, there are many red doctors who are busy with diagnosis and have to diagnose dozens or hundreds of patients every day, which is extremely unreasonable. You must know that even if a doctor is a god, he is not a god. How can an accurate and detailed diagnosis be made without detailed inquiries and examinations? It only takes a few minutes to diagnose a patient, and its perfunctoriness can be known. For the safety of patients and the morality of doctors, the number of diagnosed patients should be limited. Do not refuse anyone who comes, and embrace the psychology of the more, the better. (Remuneration donated to the children's library)

Family

### Smoky Home

— Qinghui

My father was a politician in his early years. All he knew was indulging in wine and women. His irritable temper and bad character made my mother unable to bear the pain, and she finally left one week after giving birth to me. Alas! How ruthless she was! Leaving her own daughter in a man-eating fire pit, suffering all kinds of oppression, she quietly broke away from this dark home, only to hurt me. In these ten years, I have suffered all the abuse from my stepmother. Scolding and beatings are daily lessons. My father simply doesn't treat me like a human being. He ignores me all day long, doesn't ask, doesn't listen. At the beginning of each semester, asking him for tuition requires shedding many bitter tears.

Three years ago, my father went to Guangdong to do business. When he came back, he had a slender woman with a small waist. It is said that she was his newly married wife. At first, this woman's character seemed gentle, speaking a soft Suzhou dialect. But in less than half a year, her true nature was revealed; she was finding faults all day long, and arguing with the mother who raised me. She is totally a barbarian, shrewish, and vicious woman. Strangely, my father, who has always been violent, becomes as docile as a sheep when he sees her. So she is more arrogant, and quarrels and scolds more recklessly. The already uneasy home has become even more turbid and degenerate.

This woman gave birth to a little sister. My father treats her like a pearl, almost forgetting that I am his daughter. Who comes to caress me? Who comes to sympathize with me? Maternal love is the most gentle and pure. But what about my mother? The mother in front of me will only treat me as her punching bag, only give you a few more scoldings, and draw a few more scars on your broken heart.

Originally, when I was studying, I could avoid being angry at home during the day, and I felt a little relieved, but from this semester onwards, my father no longer agreed to let me go to high school. Dropping out of school hits my unfortunate fate, and I am bound in a smoky home like a cage all day long, unable to move a step. All I see and hear are things I don't want to hear or see.

I wish I could grow two wings under my ribs, fly out of this dark, corrupt, and unfree prison, go to society to be independent, and breathe some fresh free air. But what about the profession? What profession can a junior high school graduate find?

Bewildered, bewildered, the question of where to go is hovering in my mind all day long! (Remuneration withheld)

### Debt Collection

— Xian'e

It was an autumn evening. My cousin and I were ordered by our mother and aunt to go to a relative's house to collect debts. Originally, I hated the so-called face of a debt collector the most. At this time, I was ordered to go to collect debts, wasn't it too contradictory? But because my cousin wanted me to accompany her, I couldn't refuse, so I quickly put on my coat, got on the bus, and headed for our destination.

In the dim light, the tightly closed black door opened. The one who opened the door for us was an elderly elder. Although he was nearly seventy years old, he was still very healthy. After we greeted him, he led us into a narrow and small bedroom and dining room. There were several small beds, and six or seven children were sitting on the beds or standing on the ground, all folding handicrafts in their hands. Seeing the arrival of us two strangers, they all opened their dark eyes and peered at us. I saw that the person we were looking for was not present, and the elderly elder was busy making tea for our arrival. I was about to say what I had prepared, but because of his uneasy appearance, I retracted the words back into my stomach. He then asked about our recent situation, and he talked about the previous situation of his beloved factory. He said: "Before the war, our factory was located in Hongkou. At that time, we built our own factory buildings, recruited workers, and manufactured various electrical tools such as electric refrigerators, irons, and electric furnaces. They were not only sold in this city, but also shipped to other ports. Who knew that the business was just booming when the war broke out, so we had to move to the concession. For several years, the production has been quite small due to the lack of machines, so it is still difficult to maintain the capital now, how can we talk about making money?" After saying that, he shook his head frequently. Suddenly, he opened his dry eyes and said, "But now we are already preparing to move the factory to the interior." I thought of the needs of the interior, and nodded without realizing it: "This is very good." Suddenly he asked us, "I wonder if you have anything to do here?" I hurriedly answered, "There is nothing, but we just passed by here and came to visit you!" Immediately we said goodbye and came out. He said as he walked, "You are really good children! Come and play when you are free!" We hurriedly stepped out of the door. My cousin looked at me and said, "How do we answer when we go back?" I looked at the flashing lights in the distance and said confusedly, "Let them come themselves!"

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

The old woman left happily. From that night on, the strange and charming face of Wang's wife unconsciously added a bit more color. In her heart, there was an unspeakable desire burning. It seemed that even God intended to help her succeed. Three or four days later, Wang left for Tianjin for business matters. Before leaving, he habitually explained everything in the family to his wife, including thousands of cash and several passbooks from foreign banks, which made her almost want to thank him.

In fact, Wang couldn't stop her from doing anything at home, but his departure was certainly more convenient for her. The next day at noon, Wang's wife had already bought a diamond ring worth nine hundred yuan. On the way back, she went to the theater for lunch, which was specifically to check out the terrain there in advance. "Terrain"? That's right, it's terrain! Whether a man seduces a woman or a woman plays with a man, the situation is the same as a hunter hunting; to hunt, of course, you must first check out the terrain!

Wang's wife was almost waiting in despair. One night, when she was, as usual, admiring the woman with a thousand charming faces transformed by the begonia with all her attention, she really wanted to throw the diamond ring she had just bought onto the stage, but fortunately, she still had some rationality, so she reluctantly restrained herself.

In this week or so, Xiao Rongkui's heart was indeed not at peace. He had exhausted all his intelligence. His first difficulty was that Yuan Shaowen and Qiuhaitang had too many opportunities to meet. They simply ate together every night. It was really not easy for Rongkui to impersonate his name; Secondly, he can only blame himself. Although his courage was great, he suffered from not having studied, and his wit was not enough, so he has been delayed until the ninth day, when he happened to take advantage of the opportunity that Yuan Shaowen and Yuan Zhenshoushi had important official business and went to Director Wu's house for dinner, and he managed to lure Qiuhaitang to the United Kingdom.

### Robert Montgomery's Success (Part 1) Achieving Status Through "The Masked Man" Appearing on Screen for the First Time with Garbo

— Shi Di

A Gambling Expert Fifteen years ago, a journalist in his Greenwich Village apartment in New York City hosted a banquet for a large number of guests, including film professionals and some Broadway actors. It was then that Marilyn Hawkins brought in an unfamiliar young man, handsome and tall, who caught the eye of many. But who knew he was suffering from the terror of unemployment! Someone started a gambling game, and the young actor stared blankly, appearing very eager but also very disappointed, because he was an expert in this kind of gambling, but unfortunately had no money on him. Sensing his unspoken eagerness, Marilyn Hawkins secretly gave him five dollars, and he happily joined the game, sweeping the whole table, returning half of his winnings and the original borrowed five dollars to her. Robert Montgomery was this kind of guy. Since being supported by Marilyn Hawkins, he no longer gambled for money but gambled for happiness in society. As a result, he succeeded and became very wealthy.

Born into a Wealthy Family It is difficult to portray the smooth, humble, and handsome Robert Montgomery as a farmer, although he once was one. He was born on May 21, 1902. His father, Henry Montgomery, was the vice chairman of a rubber company in New York, a famous business tycoon. He and his brother, Donald, were blessed. At the age of sixteen, they were sent to a specialized school in Bolling and traveled around the American continent during the holidays. Unfortunately, good times didn't last. After his father suddenly passed away, he left behind a bleak situation with no huge inheritance, only a farm in Bolling. He temporarily worked there as a farmer. Later, he found a job at a local ironworks. Once, some mischievous workers locked him in a coal furnace, almost suffocating him. When he had saved some money, he went to New York to find a better job and finally got a crew position on a tanker for Mobil Oil, sailing to St. Peter's. This allowed him to visit Hollywood, but he didn't think about it much at the time. After returning to New York, he quit and shared a small room with a man named TJ, who was a future screenwriter. At that time, TJ made a living by doing odd jobs on Broadway. Through his introduction, Robert Montgomery first appeared on stage, playing a single episode bandit in "The Masked Man," which was a success. He was appreciated by the famous producer George Cukor and met Hollywood stars such as Bette Davis, Ralph Morgan, and Marilyn Hawkins, who had given him five dollars for gambling.

Don Ameche will have a happy year.

Belen Stanley will gain greater pleasure in her private life. Clark Gable will have a little Gable born.

Norma Shearer will probably enjoy a new romance by the end of this year, and Silver's personality will also change from tragic to comedic roles.

Deanna Durbin will officially marry next year.

Edward G. Robinson can achieve even better box office records this year.

Tyrone Power will enjoy happiness in his personal life, but his career will not achieve much.

Between July and October, the plans of Van Johnson Jr. will be hindered, so he might as well terminate his contract with the company.

Carole Lombard can only make small gains this year; she will reach the peak of her career next year.

If Olivia de Havilland is diligent, 1941 will be her year of success.

### Random Notes from the Art Scene

— Hu Xueying

After the public screenings of "Baiyun Hometown" [White Cloud Hometown] and "Qiancheng Wanli" [Boundless Future] in Hong Kong resulted in a huge increase in business, they have attracted the attention of filmmakers in the area. It is expected that a large number of similar films will be produced in a short period of time. This is a good phenomenon because, in any case, they are somewhat related to resistance and construction. They are not like the "wooden fish book" and "folk films," which are either about princes in distress or maids disguised, or even demons and monsters, walking corpses, which leave people feeling cold.

Following Cai Chusheng's "Qiancheng Wanli," the second work of the Xinsheng Film Company has been decided to be "Love of the Motherland," directed by Situ Huimin, and will begin filming soon.

Rumors that Jin Xinmin, manager of the Minhua Film Company, will raise one million yuan to establish a large hotel are not true. According to Jin's spokesperson, he has been focusing all his energy on managing Minhua recently, and has not even considered other business ventures.

The play that Minhua is co-producing with the Shanghai Drama School has been tentatively named "Song of Ancient China." The theme is to promote the inherent morality of the nation, and the form is new and different from previous films like "Zhan Jing Tang" [Killing the Classics]. The production attitude has not changed, and they aim to make it a decent "Chinese opera."

### Hollywood New Predictions (Part 2)

— Qing Hui

Changes in Individual Stars

Charlie Chaplin will encounter major accidents in February, July, and October, and some disappointments will begin in early April.

Katharine Hepburn is starting to change her style, making more adult works.

Bette Davis continues to have good luck, but she will definitely not win another Academy Award. A speculative business venture will attract her attention.

Spencer Tracy will change his on-screen personality and develop a new acting style.

Lionel Barrymore must pay more attention to his health this year.

Bing Crosby continues to raise horses, but his profits have decreased.

### Yaleshe Music Concert

The Shanghai Yaleshe [Elegant Music Society] will hold a music concert at the Lyceum Theatre on the evenings of February 18th and 20th. Details have been noted in previous reports.

This concert held by the society is grand in scale and features a splendid program, which will surely add a unique splendor to Shanghai's music scene. Therefore, ticket buyers are very enthusiastic, and seat reservations and exchanges for numbered tickets began on the 3rd.

The singing training class jointly organized by the Shanghai East Commune Women's Youth Association will hold a concert at 7:30 pm on February 1st at the auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. The program includes orchestral ensemble, piano and violin solos, solo singing, and chorus. Ticket prices are divided into three types: five yuan, two yuan, and one yuan.
