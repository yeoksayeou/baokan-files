### Regarding the Alleged U.S.-Soviet Agreement: Chinese Government Issues Statement – Will Continue Fighting Until Japanese Troops Withdraw from Chinese Territory, No Peace Possible

Chongqing – Sources of the highest authority here reiterated today that China will not discuss peace until Japanese troops have completely withdrawn from China and Manchuria. They also stated that Japan's attempts to induce the United States to mediate the Sino-Japanese War are propaganda intended to confuse international opinion and delay U.S. aid to China. Chinese authorities pointed out that the withdrawal of Japanese troops is a definite principle understood by all Chinese people, not a basis for negotiation. Authorities emphasized that, to date, Japan has shown no sincerity in establishing peace on this basis. Therefore, this publicity by Japan will absolutely not deceive foreign governments. Authorities further stated that Japan's propaganda is being put forth as the U.S. government intensifies its material and technical aid to China, and that Japan's message is exploratory in nature, seeking to test U.S. preparedness for military cooperation with China in the Pacific. Political observers pointed out that the conditions for mediation published in Moscow newspapers are self-contradictory. If Japanese troops withdraw, how can they maintain their main position in China? Political observers noted the prominent placement of the mediation news in Soviet newspapers with great interest. However, Chinese and foreign figures doubt that the U.S. will attempt to mediate according to the conditions published in Soviet newspapers. They point out that these conditions are very similar to the notorious Lansing-Ishii Agreement, which caused years of serious difficulties for U.S. Far Eastern policy. The Chinese side does not wish to comment on the mediation proposal put forward by Senator Thomas, a Democratic Senator from Utah. Thomas advocates organizing an American committee agreed upon by both China and Japan to gradually mediate. Chinese military figures state that amidst these peace rumors, Japanese troops are launching attacks on two key fronts on all major fronts, intending to confuse foreign governments and Chinese troops fighting on the front lines.

### U.S. Political Circles Consider Mediation of War to Be an Exploratory Ploy by Japan

Washington – Government circles here yesterday considered the news carried by Izvestia of Japan's proposal for the United States to mediate the Sino-Japanese War to be a "trial balloon." Most officials declined to comment. Well-informed sources said that the news was originally published in a New York newspaper, but was issued by the Tokyo office, likely indicating a semi-official attempt to gauge the reaction of China and the United States to this plan. Officials neither confirmed nor denied receiving the proposal, but well-informed sources expressed doubt as to whether the authorities had actually received it. Political leaders such as Senator Thomas, a Democratic Senator from Utah, and the government's most powerful diplomat and Far East writer, criticized it personally. Senator Thomas told a United Press reporter that mediation is worthy of consideration, but dismissed the news carried by Pravda as unrealistic. Thomas said that he had long urged a gradual solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute, and added that if an American mediation committee, agreed upon by both China and Japan, could be established to gradually seek a solution to this problem based on reality, the differences between the two countries could be gradually eliminated and the balance of power in the Far East restored. Thomas also said that any proposal that does not give Tokyo and Chongqing equal footing beforehand is bound to fail. He added that the issue of Japan's recognition of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek cannot become a goal of mediation. "The United States must not exchange China's rights for rights in the South Pacific. China is a complete country in both fact and law. Whether Japan is willing to advance south or not cannot be a point of selling out China's rights. These two points are completely different matters. China's rights have been established due to the regeneration of the country's resources. No mediation may sell out these rights; what can be mediated are only differences and disputes, certainly not exclusive rights." Thomas also suggested including the American Federation of Labor or Latin American countries as part of this mediation committee to broaden the base. Others expressed indifference towards mediation unless Japan agrees beforehand to recognize China's absolute independence and integrity. However, many astute observers believe that mediating the Sino-Japanese conflict now is more appropriate than at any time since 1938. The various urgent appeals for peace from the Japanese, and the U.S. concern about fighting Germany before Japan announces its true intentions, should not coincide. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

### Three Basic Points of Alleged U.S.-Soviet Agreement

New York – According to a report from the Tokyo correspondent of the New York Herald Tribune, authoritative sources claim that the United States recently received a proposal from unofficial Japanese sources to conclude a U.S.-Japan agreement on all of the Far East and the South Seas. The purpose of this proposal is to test the attitude of the U.S. government, including the following basic points for establishing a U.S.-Japan agreement: (1) The United States mediates the Sino-Japanese War, and Japanese troops first withdraw from the internal provinces of China. (2) The United States recognizes Japan's superior position in China. (3) Japan guarantees to avoid

### U.S. Ambassador to Japan Meets with Matsuoka

Tokyo – U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka at his private residence at Matsuoka's invitation. The nature of the conversation is not yet known. However, Japanese sources said that the U.S. ambassador and his wife were invited to a tea party at the Foreign Minister's private residence. It was also said that Grew recommended a special American doctor to treat Matsuoka's cold after his return from a tour of Europe. It was also said that Matsuoka may invite the British ambassador to his tea party. (United Press dispatch, 19th) taking hostile action in the South, and the United States makes significant economic concessions to Japan (allowing it in the South). At the same time, the U.S. may provide Japan with large loans. The correspondent also stated that some parties believe that the U.S. government has seriously considered the above Japanese proposal, but before starting negotiations, the U.S. will require Japan to fulfill the following conditions: (1) Japan should not insist on the statement made in January 1938 that it will not have any contact with General Chiang Kai-shek. (2) Japan should change its declaration that it will not accept third-party mediation. (3) Japan should explain its economic plans in the Far East. It is said that the agreement also stipulates that Japan may not use the Axis powers to deal with the United States. As for whether the Japanese government will give serious consideration to this proposal put forward by Japanese sources, it is impossible to ascertain. However, Japanese opinions are still highly divided. Some parties advocate making peace with Chongqing, but another part strongly advocates continuing the war and recognizing Nanjing. When mentioning this issue, Pravda stated, "According to other sources, the U.S.-Japan agreement proposal was not put forward by the Japanese side; this matter was initiated by the U.S. side." (TASS dispatch, 19th)

Moscow – Pravda, the authoritative newspaper of the Soviet Union, yesterday published prominently a New York dispatch stating that reliable Japanese sources in Japan had suggested that the United States mediate the Sino-Japanese War, and that Japan proposed to withdraw Japanese troops from the interior of China, allowing the United States to recognize Japan's position as leader in Asia. At the same time, it is rumored that Japan would also propose not to launch wars in the South Seas, in exchange for obtaining economic rights there, or a loan from the United States. The message also stated that the Japanese side believes that the U.S. government is giving this suggestion serious consideration, but requiring Japan to change its attitude towards Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It was also said that the reaction of the Japanese government to this proposal is unknown, but it is clear that Japanese public opinion is now divided into two factions: one faction wants to establish understanding with Chongqing, and the other demands that the war continue. Pravda did not attach a note, saying, "Other sources" claim that the United States is taking the initiative to mediate the differences between China and Japan. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

### Chongqing Bomb Disposal Squad Clears Unexploded Bombs – Begins Work Immediately After Japanese Planes Leave – Recently Discovered Japanese Use of Gasoline Incendiary Bombs

Chongqing – The "daredevil teams" in London who specialize in digging up unexploded bombs, their bravery, have been praised by the world. However, the Chongqing bomb disposal squad, engaged in the work of excavating unexploded bombs, have been at it for three years now and are considered normal work and no one praises them. In the past two years, quite a few of the Japanese bombs have been unexploded. After each air raid, there are often many caves of unknown cause, which must be explored to see if they are caused by bombs. The Chinese bomb disposal squad, because they know that the Japanese have not used time-delayed bombs, immediately begin digging after the Japanese planes fly away. Sometimes they find that the holes in the ground are caused by stones falling from a high place, but often there are holes pierced by unexploded bombs. The largest of these unexploded bombs was excavated at an intersection in the downtown area of Chongqing last year, measuring up to ten feet deep in the soil. When it was excavated, it weighed 750 kilograms, 30 inches in diameter, and six feet high. The explosives of this unexploded bomb were removed by experts, or sold to chemical medicine merchants, or used to manufacture Chinese munitions, and the shell was used as scrap iron. Chongqing officials often jokingly say that some kind of chemical medicine needed has been shipped by Japan by express airmail. These unexploded bombs have never exploded during excavation, so the excavation does not isolate the area, and onlookers are allowed to watch the excavation. Recently, during an air raid, a bomb landed in the western suburbs of Chongqing. When the bomb disposal squad excavated this unexploded bomb all night, vehicles and pedestrians all circled around the hole. Recently, a bomb dropped on Chongqing pierced the roof and two floors of the National Library. The bomb landed in the wet soil, but the roof and floor of the hole had gasoline-like liquid, and there was a gasoline smell, so the Chinese have discovered that the Japanese army has first decided to use gasoline incendiary bombs in Chongqing.

He said that on the contrary, we should make full use of our strength to fight against Japan, and the Eighth Route Army is now fighting the Japanese army in the area designated by the Central authorities.

Editorial

### The Fall in Rice Prices and the Future

The political atmosphere is foul and dark, with no freedom for modern citizens to enjoy or breathe. Public security is characterized by rampant bandits, and life and property lack guaranteed legal safety. Movement is only permitted within a small space; beyond that, the path is full of thorns. Price increases of only three to five times are rare, while the daily necessities of life have mostly skyrocketed by ten, eight, or even dozens of times. In short, all kinds of mental and material miseries are pressing upon the brows of every Shanghai resident, not allowing them to look up and face reality. This has been gradually worsening for the past three to five years, with the last year or two being even worse. However, in the past few days, the price of rice has fallen again and again from 140-150 yuan, approaching the 100 yuan mark. As a result, the residents of Shanghai feel a little more relieved, perhaps the first time in years that they have been able to force a smile! Our newspaper has repeatedly advocated for the concession authorities to raise funds to manage rice supplies independently for the past year. Now that we see it being implemented, we are naturally delighted to see the sharp drop in rice prices.

The fall in rice prices to just over 100 yuan does not mean that residents have been released from their heavy burdens and that life is now easy. The municipal council's sale of rice at a fixed price does not mean that Shanghai's food supply is guaranteed, that everything is solved, and that there are no more problems. It must be understood that a rice price of 100 yuan is still considered difficult to afford for those with middle and lower incomes. Shanghai has a dense population and cannot smoothly regulate supply and demand with grain-producing areas. The municipal council, as a local administrative body, has no choice but to operate the buying and selling of rice and grain. How can this phenomenon and method be relied upon to last? Moreover, the difficulty of people's livelihoods lies not only in the high price of rice, but also in the high price of firewood, charcoal, oil, salt, and everything else needed for food and clothing. The sharp drop in rice prices has not been cheap, and other commodity prices have not fallen sharply along with rice prices. The serious threat that society is experiencing in economic terms is far from being relieved. Some say that the general trend of commodity prices towards decline must also happen gradually. After rice prices have fallen for countless days, there is no need to expect other commodity prices to fall sharply with them. In other words, once rice prices fall, other commodity prices will eventually decline slowly. This is a reasonable explanation, and a further judgment can be made. If rice prices continue at this level for the next few days, or even continue to fall, then there is no reason why other commodity prices will not fall. Firstly, due to the relationship between the production costs of various goods and the daily expenses of various industries, the price of rice will inevitably affect various goods. Secondly, due to the relationship between people's hearts and the blind reaction, the unnecessary price increases of various goods that followed the price of rice in the past will naturally return to their original state due to the price of rice now. Thirdly, due to the downward trend factors inherent in the price of rice itself, whether they are political, ethical, societal, or commercial, they must also be factors in the downward trend of various goods at the same time. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the fact that various goods have not fallen in price yet. However, in addition to various normal factors, there are still artificial factors such as monopolies, manipulations, and sabotage that are also a hidden force in determining market conditions. The incessant horizontal jumps and sharp rises in market conditions over the past year or two are not entirely due to high costs, scarce supplies, thin inventories, and increased demand; most of them are due to artificial factors. For example, yesterday's rice market rose again by three or four yuan, or five or six yuan, for no other reason than artificial manipulation! These kinds of conspiracies and machinations must be jointly suppressed and dealt with by the concession authorities and residents. Otherwise, not only can we not hope that various goods will fall along with the price of rice, but the price of rice may also rise again. At that time, the municipal council's method of selling rice at a fixed price will also be twice the effort for half the result. As the saying goes, "Think of pain after the pain has passed," and "Be vigilant in times of peace." On this day when it is difficult to force a smile for the past few years, the officials and people of Shanghai must not be negligent and think that they have achieved success and can rest easy. Not only are there those who attempt to suck our blood and absorb our energy, lurking in many ways and with all kinds of conspiracies, but also with regard to those who are currently spurring the rice market to turn around and fall sharply, the fundamental reason is that Hong Kong, which does not produce a single grain, should not be relied upon as a mountain. Is it possible that there will be no waves or obstacles between Shanghai and Hong Kong? And between Hong Kong and the production areas, there may be unpredictable winds and clouds at any time! Therefore, from today until the autumn and winter when new grain comes on the market, how Shanghai's food supply should maintain stability requires that we seize the opportunity and make proper arrangements during this time when we are forcing ourselves to smile. The sorrow of the rice weevils is not worth pitying at the moment; only by placing the rice weevils in a hell of eternal destruction can we warn future generations!

Secretary of State Hull's Broadcast – Announces Two Major U.S. Policies – Guaranteeing Delivery of War Supplies to Britain – And Elucidating Post-War Trade Principles

New York – Last night, Secretary of State Hull broadcast two important announcements regarding U.S. policy. First, he stated that the United States will definitely find a way to guarantee that Britain receives an ample supply. Second, he explained the principles that the U.S. government believes it can lead the world with in restoring peace. These principles are being announced by the U.S. for the first time. Hull stated that most of this year's U.S. foreign trade is for self-defense tools, just as it is futile if goods cannot reach where they are intended. We are practical people. We have decided to do one thing and we will definitely complete it. We are now wholeheartedly engaged in providing arms and aid to those who are most closely related to our defense and security. We must not allow this goal to fail. I have said this before, and I may as well say it again. We will find a way to ensure that the increasingly large amounts of war materials produced in our factories safely reach the hands of those who need them most. The greatest goal of the Axis powers is to seize maritime power so that they can rule the world. If we do not now stop the spread of the behavior of treating the laws of the world as worthless, we will soon be surrounded by aggressors and forced to fight alone in a fight of the few against the many for the sake of our national existence. One or the other must be chosen. Hull then made the first important announcement regarding peace principles, stating that peace principles must include the following points: (1) Extreme nationalism must no longer be allowed to appear in excessive trade restrictions. (2) Non-discrimination must be the norm in international commercial relations, so that international trade can develop and prosper. (3) Raw materials and supplies must be available to all countries without discrimination. (4) International agreements adjusting the supply of goods must be handled in a way that can protect both consumer countries and their people. (5) International financial organizations and methods must be properly arranged to assist each country's necessary enterprises and its continued development, and to use trade procedures suitable for each country's welfare to repay debts. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Washington – Secretary of State Hull said in a radio broadcast yesterday at the opening of National Foreign Trade Week that the significance of the Axis powers defeating Britain is to establish a system of masters and slaves throughout the world. We must carefully consider the defense and security of our own country and ensure that Britain receives a large amount of aid. The lawlessness and unrest in the world must be stopped. Otherwise, our country will be surrounded by aggressor countries and forced to fight alone and seek survival. Hull did not explicitly mention protecting navigation, only mentioning that U.S. war materials must be found a way to reach Britain. The American people are a pragmatic nation. Once we embark on a great undertaking, we will surely complete it seriously. Therefore, we can guarantee that large amounts of war materials from U.S. factories will flow to Britain in a growing stream. Hull also expounded on his lifelong international reciprocity principle, explaining a post-war economic plan that will adopt free and open commercial exchanges throughout the world, including the handling of raw materials without barriers and ample financial assistance, so that all countries can develop production. This plan requires that the threat of supreme military force and conspiracies of annexation be eliminated. (United Press dispatch, 19th)

### America Holds "Aid China Week" to Raise Funds for Refugee Relief; China Defends Democratic Nations, Americans Should Sympathize with China's Struggle

Washington - The "Aid China Week," held simultaneously across the United States, officially opened today. Fourteen state governors and 200 mayors of major cities issued proclamations calling on Americans to cooperate in completing the United China Relief Association's $5 million fundraising campaign to aid Chinese refugees. They emphasized the importance of providing immediate concrete assistance to China, stating that such aid should not only be used for combat but also for disaster relief and reconstruction. This is the first nationwide movement to aid China, aiming not only to raise funds for refugee relief but also to deepen Americans' understanding of China's great resistance war of the past four years and the arduous task of nation-building. This work largely depends on financial and material assistance from American friends. The main activities of Aid China Week are concentrated in New York, where the goal is to raise $1.7 million. Activities throughout the week will focus on cultural circles, women's circles, business circles, and children. Celebrities participating include singer Lily, Lin Yutang, Simpson, and Pearl Buck, among others. At the height of the week's festivities, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, members of Jewish welfare organizations, Salvation Army members, and overseas Chinese from Chinatown will march along major streets in New York City to demonstrate the close cooperation between China and the United States. Sunday (the 25th) is designated as a day of prayer for fallen Chinese soldiers. The Governor of New York issued a statement urging people from all walks of life in the United States, regardless of party affiliation, to provide the greatest possible assistance to this remaining democratic nation. The statement emphasized, "We must see China as the defense line of democratic nations in the Pacific. For nearly a decade, China has resisted the most brutal aggression in history. Most of China's cities have been destroyed, causing us great horror. China is currently one of the great nations practicing democracy and defending democracy. It is now fighting to maintain a free system. Americans greatly sympathize with this nation fighting for freedom. If the freedom and independence of 400 million people are lost, and if Germany, Italy, and Japan truly enslave the Chinese people, the profound impact on American politics and economy is unimaginable. It is extremely important to strengthen China's hope and belief in democracy, so that China can be built into a democratic nation with justice and order." New York Mayor LaGuardia, Chairman of the Mayors' Committee, also issued a statement, saying that China is the only remaining major democratic country in the Far East, fighting for an ideal life, which is also most cherished by Americans. For the past four years, the Chinese people have lived daily under the terror of total war, and their country is constantly in danger of being occupied by totalitarian countries. LaGuardia added that Americans deeply sympathize with nations defending their free homeland and are prepared to provide concrete assistance to China without violating neutrality or getting involved in the war. LaGuardia also urged the citizens of New York to dedicate their efforts this week to helping China.

### Duke Aosta Surrenders to Britain; Italian Forces Collapse in East Africa; British Troops Occupy Amba Alagi; Troops to be Redeployed to Reinforce the Near East

Cairo - With the formal surrender of Duke Aosta, the Supreme Commander of the Italian forces in East Africa, Mussolini's East African territory has effectively disintegrated, and the Australian troops besieged in Tobruk are also gaining the upper hand. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

Cairo - Amba Alagi, an important crossroads on the road south to Bari, has also been occupied by British troops. It is generally believed that the fall of Amba Alagi is extremely important, as it is not only the strongest fortress of the Italian side but also controls the north-south traffic of the area. It is widely believed that Duke Aosta, in compliance with Hitler's instructions to resist as much as possible in the area in order to contain a portion of British forces, may continue to resist in the Gonder and Great Lakes regions. However, it is believed that Duke Aosta's acceptance of the surrender terms will have a demoralizing effect on other Italian commanders who are determined to fight. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)

Cairo - After the remaining Italian troops in Amba Alagi, East Africa, surrendered to the British, the terms proposed by the British have been accepted by the Italian forces. The British will take over the city and disarm the Italian troops on a day scheduled soon. (Havas dispatch on the 19th)

Rome - An official announcement stated that after the Italian troops in Amba Alagi, Italian East Africa, were ordered to cease fire, their commander, Duke Aosta, the Governor of Abyssinia, shared the fate of his troops. (Havas dispatch on the 19th)

London - It was learned today that as a result of the conditions of surrender proposed by the Governor of Abyssinia, Aosta, Britain may be able to redeploy several thousand elite British troops and hundreds of aircraft from Abyssinia in the next few days to strengthen the Imperial forces in the Near East. There is great anticipation here for the surrender of this Italian colony and at least 7,000 Italian troops. Military experts here believe that other Italian troops will surrender. Politically, it is hoped that Britain will quickly hand over the recovered territories to the Abyssinian army led by King Selassie, with only a small number of British troops remaining to help maintain order. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

Cairo - Regarding the surrender of Duke Aosta's Italian troops in the Amba Alagi region of Abyssinia, the British only agreed to cease fire from 6:00 PM to 9:15 PM on Friday to discuss the conditions. There is no news yet on the outcome of the negotiations for surrender. The main fortresses of the Italian army in Amba Alagi are now completely surrounded. These fortresses are located on high mountains, rising into the clouds and shrouded in mist, but South African troops and patriotic Abyssinian troops are attacking from the south, and British troops are pressing from the north. The Italian army was completely surrounded on Friday, with the support of British artillery and air forces. At 8:15 AM on the same day, the Italian army showed signs of surrendering, sending several junior officers as representatives to the British lines to discuss the terms of surrender. The British declared that if the officers were indeed speaking on behalf of Duke Aosta, the British would negotiate and ordered a ceasefire from 6:00 PM. If the conditions were not accepted, the artillery fire would resume at 9:15 PM. The details of the negotiations after the ceasefire are not yet known. If Duke Aosta accepts the terms of surrender, the impact will be to demoralize the Italian troops who are still resisting elsewhere. A Reuters military correspondent stated that Aosta's request for surrender does not necessarily mean the end of the war in the area. Aosta, while seeing the futility of continuing resistance in the Amba Alagi region, did not mention the other two centers of Italian resistance: Gonder, southwest of Amba Alagi, and the Lake region, about 200 miles south of the Abyssinian capital. Hitler may have ordered a sustained resistance within the broadest possible range in the area to contain a portion of the British forces, preventing them from being transferred to North Africa to attack Libya. Therefore, Aosta is unlikely to order the Italian troops in Gonder and the Lake region to cease resistance. The exact strength of the Italian forces in the area is currently unknown. A week ago, it was estimated that there were about 33,000 Italian troops and about 36,000 indigenous troops in the area, but there is no official news on their distribution. If a large number of Italian troops are defending Amba Alagi, the surrender of the Italian troops there will quickly end the war in other areas. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)

London - A Reuters correspondent with the vanguard of the British forces near Sollum reported that some of the positions around Sollum captured by the British forces on Thursday have been retaken by the German forces.

However, a certain famous British regiment is still holding positions on the coastal plain near Sollum. The situation on the top of the slopes is unclear. It is believed that the German forces there have retreated before the British vanguard, but the German forces have not completely retaken their old positions. It is reported that the German forces are currently in a position where their right flank is vulnerable to attack. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)

### Darlan Returns to Paris to Reopen Franco-German Negotiations; Parisian Press Urges U.S. President to Mediate Peace Through Negotiations

Vichy - French Cabinet Associate Darlan returned to Paris yesterday to reopen negotiations for Franco-German cooperation. At the same time, the Parisian press unanimously launched an appeal to President Roosevelt to mediate the European war through negotiated peace. Parisian newspapers under German control declared that as a result of the prestige gained by the United States through increasing the production of war materials, it can effectively dictate the terms for ending the war between Britain and the Axis powers. Editorials in various newspapers stated that France believes that neither side of the belligerents has the strength to launch a decisive offensive. Therefore, a negotiated peace is the only hope for rebuilding Europe. The newspapers pointed out that Roosevelt now has two paths to take: to strive for mediation of the war, with French observers here recognizing President Roosevelt and the Pope as the only qualified figures to mediate, and France is willing to support any peace movement. However, if the war cannot be ended quickly, France will fully cooperate with the Axis to organize a new European economic group, stopping short of military cooperation. (United Press dispatch on the 19th)

### Germany and Turkey to Sign a Commercial Treaty; Turkish Parliamentarian Sadak Comments on German-Turkish Relations

In addition, a clearing arrangement is stipulated, and Turkey must repay £45 million (Turkish currency). (Havas dispatch on the 18th)

Istanbul - Turkish Parliamentarian Sadak commented on Turkish-German relations in an article in the Akşam newspaper yesterday, stating that Turkey's foreign policy is based on national interests. When the Balkan war broke out, Turkey declared its neutrality. Only defensive measures are taken when the country is not invaded. Turkey's intervention would not benefit Greece and Britain but would only weaken Turkey's defenses. The rapid end of the Balkan war proves that Turkey's judgment was correct. The Balkan war can prove that Germany's sole objective is against Britain, not to fight for victory or to expand the spread of the war. If Germany's purpose is to defeat Turkey, it would only attack Turkey if it needed to, or if it had to pass through Turkish territory to achieve other goals. Therefore, Germany does not need to attack Turkey. Hitler's statement regarding German-Turkish relations is clear evidence. News of Germany attacking the Dardanelles Strait and passing through Turkey to attack Egypt comes from abroad. Currently, both countries are concerned with maintaining peaceful relations.

### Daily Newspaper Attacks: Britain Bans Coconut Kernel Exports to Japan, Claiming Interference with Japanese Food Policy

Tokyo – Japanese newspapers have recently criticized Britain's suspension of coconut kernel exports from the Pacific region, claiming it is an attempt to interfere with Japan's economic lifeline. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" accused the British government of ordering indigenous people of Western Pacific islands not to sell coconut kernels, calling it an "inhumane attempt" to disrupt Japan's food policy. The newspaper reported that the Japanese government had ordered coconut kernels at a price of 100 yen per ton to produce oil and alleviate the shortage of cooking oil in Japan. The paper also stated that the Japanese government was preparing to send special ships to transport the oil, but the British government interfered, angering the indigenous people who depend on selling coconut kernels for their livelihood. The Tokyo government is closely monitoring the outcome of this case. Furthermore, the "Yomiuri Shimbun," in its commentary on the situation in the Near East, stated that Arab troops cooperating with the German army will begin operations throughout the region in an attempt to break free from British control. The newspaper urged the Japanese people to pay attention to the development of the Near East situation, which is closely related to Japan. The newspaper further pointed out that Japan held a superior position in trade in the Near East before the European war, becoming finally independent. Historically, Europeans may consider the Near East as part of Europe, but the region belongs to Asia, and we must not allow it to be ravaged as a playground for Europeans.

He hopes that Muslims everywhere will understand these facts, avoid misunderstandings, and jointly condemn Ali Gailani. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

Random Talks on the European War (5) (6)

### London Fire Account

So we can only stand on the deserted streets and watch the glass mirror boxes burst and wedding rings melt. This tragedy is even worse than the burning of a church, because the church has pious believers donating money to rebuild it, but no one will care about the shops.

Across the street, a group of people are surging out of the cellar. They are exhausted and look pitiful. Air raid wardens are helping to carry bedding and other items. They stand on the sidewalk with a sense of helplessness. They told Maglie that they were originally in a shelter a quarter of a mile away. But the air raid warden told them that the houses above were on fire, so they had to carry their bedding and pillows to another place. They had only been here for an hour when the air raid warden asked them to move again. This is the third time, where should they go now? Although they are at a loss, no one complains and no one goes crazy.

The air raid wardens are all tough Londoners. Although they are exhausted, they are still indomitable. This kind of tenacious British spirit can be seen all night.

As we walked down a winding street, a gentle breeze blew. At a turn, firefighters lined up in two rows, facing away from us, looking at the waterfall-like flames on the street. From the badges on their collars, I knew they were from the remote countryside of London. Although they shook their heads at Maglie to show that it was not appropriate and warned us to be careful of falling bricks and tiles, they still let us pass. At this time, the wind was getting stronger. Maglie's hair was flying in front of her head, and her skirt was blown up by the wind at her knees. I also pressed down on my hat. Gusts of cold air rushed from the street, driving away millions of cubic feet of heat. This fire was like thousands of chimneys venting, which created this wind.

This row of houses has narrow storefronts but is seven stories high. The fire brutally pounced on us. The heat from a burning house could pass through the walls and set the neighboring house on fire. In the sound of the flames, the sound of breaking glass could be heard continuously, like the sound of drizzling rain.

The wind helped the fire's power, causing the sparks to rise into a red pillar. There is a small church at the end of the street. In the dark square of the church, sparks fell like rain. As it slowly circled down, it created a spectacle I had never seen before in my life.

We ventured deep into the flame-filled street, making the firefighters behind us uneasy. But I knew what they were paying attention to was that Maglie was indeed an extremely beautiful woman. She was not wearing a hat, and her curly golden hair fluttered in the wind. The most pleasing thing about walking with Maglie is that everyone has to turn around and look at her with admiration and respect. She is not the kind of woman that Italians pay attention to, but even Swedes have to turn around and take a look. Moreover, her attitude and demeanor show that she is also brave.

In peaceful times, a woman's bravery is not highly valued. In her life, she may not need to be brave even once. The knowledge of shorthand is ten thousand times more useful. But the war has changed this situation. Bravery has become the best quality of men and women. A person who is not brave will be immediately despised by everyone.

The firefighters looked at Maglie, but Maglie stood on the street in the flames, watching the sparks flying like snowflakes. She shouted, "What a magnificent sight!" I want to cross this fire pit.

I said, "That's not fun!"

Maglie said, "Is it fun to be a firefighter! Is it fun for us to go out tonight! Is it fun to resist almost one hundred million Germans with less than fifty million British people! The only people who are safe and sound in London tonight can be found in the basement of the Lufoia Hotel. Are you coming with me?"

I braced myself and replied: "Okay!"

The driver was touched and suddenly said, "I want to go with you too. This is my hometown. I will never see this situation again." He did not address us as "sir" or "madam," and I was very happy to hear that.

So we ran along the street with flames soaring into the sky. I let Maglie lean on my side to keep her away from the collapsing houses. I held her arm and helped her run over the hot piles of bricks and tiles. The driver no longer followed two steps behind, but chased up and held her other arm.

At that time, the fire was so fierce that I felt that my right cheek was so scorched that oil was about to be extracted. I turned up my coat collar and also turned up Maglie's woolen coat collar with my free hand. The driver also helped on that side, while also paying close attention to her. Flames were coming out of the doors of the shops, like the mouths of stoves. The red and green firelight in the store was flickering and dazzling, and the sparks were falling one after another, but they were embers the size of fingernails. We must quickly put out the sparks, otherwise the coat will be burnt into many small holes.

The explosion sound in the back suddenly turned into a loud noise. We looked back and saw that a five-story building we had just passed had collapsed, piling up several feet high on the sidewalks on both sides. Our retreat was cut off. We had to rush forward through the smoke and fire before the houses in front collapsed and trapped us in the middle.

We walked past the last burning house and ran to the dark little square under the rain of sparks. But our eyes were blinded by the smoke, and we couldn't even see these big sparks. I was afraid that Maglie's hair was in danger of catching fire under the thick sparks, so I pressed my hat on her head. Her eyes were tightly closed, and so were the driver's. I propped up my eyelids with my hands to open one eye. I led them across the square, warning them in advance of the unevenness.

Finally, we arrived at a street that was not on fire and was as dark as漆, and from there we found our way back to where we parked. It was four o'clock in the morning. Maglie decided to go home early, because she had to go to work at 7:30.

Maglie said, "Wasn't the fire beautiful? Weren't those people very nice?"

I have never seen better people.

Maglie said, "These people are really gentle, honest, brave, calm, and have all of them. But now I want to sleep."

So we sent her home, and the driver sent me home. When I paid the fare, he said very seriously that he would not hesitate to miss this opportunity to watch the fire. And he forgot the titles of "sir" or "madam" again.

Two Types of Government Bonds; Principles of Fundraising

The government bond fundraising committee is promoting two types of government bonds: (1) the 29th-year military expenditure government bond, which can be purchased directly with legal tender; and (2) the 29th-year construction fund government bond, which is specially allowed to be purchased by converting legal tender. The conversion method is based on the exchange rate stipulated by the Ministry of Finance. As for the fundraising methods, the committee has also determined that both persuasion and allocation will be used. In cities, the principle of fair allocation will be adopted, while in rural areas, the principle of voluntary subscription will be adopted. In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the fundraising work, each city should establish a review committee, and invite relevant authorities and people familiar with local conditions to be members of the committee to preside over the implementation of fair allocation.

Private Industries; Loans Approved

The four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture have been ordered by the head office to expand the handling of loans for private industries in order to assist the development of private industries. Although the total amount of industrial loans in the past has reached 100 million yuan, it has been biased towards state-owned enterprises. In the future, both state-owned and private industries will be given equal importance. Those who apply for loans, regardless of the amount, will be granted loans as appropriate according to actual needs. The collateral for private loans includes: (1) industrial products such as metals, cotton yarn, cloth, dyes, cement, chemical raw materials, and silk fabrics; (2) mineral products such as coal, kerosene, gasoline, diesel, tungsten sand, manganese, antimony, iron sand, copper, iron, and tin; and (3) agricultural products such as rice, wheat, grains, flour, cotton, vegetable oil, peanuts, sesame, soybeans, silkworm cocoons, tea, salt, sugar, medicinal herbs, wood, paper, tobacco, pig bristles, and leather. However, it is stipulated that the mortgage of daily necessities of the people is related to hoarding and speculation, so special caution should be exercised and time limits should be imposed to avoid affecting people's livelihood.

Chinese Students in the U.S. Promote Aid to China

American young students are very sympathetic to China and are very interested in the study of Chinese issues. Chinese students from famous universities such as Pennsylvania, Columbia, Harvard, and Missouri have recently decided, with the consent of the North American and South American Chinese Student Associations, to depart separately during the summer vacation of this year to give lectures in various schools to promote publicity. The topics include the current situation in China, the study of methods to aid China, etc. In addition, the "Young Friends of China Association," organized by American youths who sympathize with China, has hired Chinese students studying in the United States to give lectures in New York. This move will surely make a great contribution to promoting American aid to China.

### Japanese Arrest Attempt in Beijing Apartments on Rue Paul Beau

Chen Wannian, a 30-year-old Cantonese man, took his wife and two children to live in Room 5 of the Beijing Apartments at No. 439, Rue Paul Beau, French Concession, on January 23 this year. On April 27, he moved to Room 27 on the second floor. Chen suddenly moved his family away on the 15th of this month. Unexpectedly, at about 4 a.m. yesterday, five plainclothes Japanese personnel suddenly went to the apartment with personnel from the French Concession police to arrest Chen. However, Chen had already left, so they failed to arrest him. Subsequently, the Japanese personnel and detectives searched the room where Chen had lived until about 5 a.m. before leaving.

### City-Wide Publicity Yesterday; Automobile Noise Reduction Campaign; Do Not Listen to Radio in Private Cars; To Avoid Distracting Drivers

The Public Works Department's Police Department and Traffic Department of the Public Concession believe that automobile drivers often like to honk their horns indiscriminately, the purpose of which is nothing more than to make other vehicles and pedestrians on the road give way, in order to increase speed. However, it is very disruptive to the work, rest, and sleep of citizens. Because the noise is disruptive, it can indirectly distract people's minds, so it has always been strictly forbidden to honk horns indiscriminately near hospitals and schools in order to ensure

Public Tranquility

Now, in conjunction with the French Concession authorities, the "Campaign to Eliminate Automobile Horn Noise Propaganda Week" will be launched from the 100th. It has also been found that many new cars have wireless radio equipment. In the past, some people even advocated installing wireless radios in public buses to benefit passengers and reduce their loneliness. At that time, the Public Utility Committee believed that this kind of measure, while the vehicle is running,

Distracts Pedestrians

And is easy to distract, and will indirectly increase the incidence of vehicle accidents, so it was rejected. It also advises those who have wireless radio equipment in their private cars not to listen to it. The intention is purely for public order and to reduce traffic obstructions and unfortunate incidents. It is now heard that this campaign will continue until the 26th. After the end of the propaganda campaign, the promotion work will not stop. After the implementation yesterday, radio stations and cinemas also widely publicized it. The horn noise has indeed been greatly reduced. The police are also instructing drivers at any time. If anyone honks the horn indiscriminately, they will record the number and give a warning. It is still hoped that all car owners and drivers will continue to assist the police and the public, so that this summer

Those who sleep with windows open

Can get sufficient rest at night, and those who work during the day can also avoid unnecessary harassment. The reporter learned from the Public Concession's General Traffic Department that large white flags are hung in the following places, with the words "Do Not Honk Horns Indiscriminately" in red, with advertisements for Samsung toothpaste and Riri soap on both sides. It is heard that there are a total of 30 such large flags, donated by the China Chemical Industry Society and the China-West Drugstore. It is heard that there are five locations in the Northern District, with one such large flag hung at each location, with the words "Do Not Honk Horns Indiscriminately" in Chinese, English, and Japanese. There are also

40,000 Leaflets

Donated by the Niuliguo Milk Powder Company. Starting yesterday, the police at various intersections in both concessions distributed various leaflets to the drivers, urging them not to honk their horns too much, and sent large horns to major car dealerships to reduce the noise for free. It is expected that this unprecedented noise reduction campaign will be warmly assisted by all sectors.

Launch a General Cleaning

Recently, the weather has gradually become hot. In order to promote the health of citizens, a sanitation campaign has been launched. A general cleaning will be held starting today. All shops should clean the inside of the house and in front of the door separately to keep it clean.

### Number of Rice Ships Doubles; Foreign Rice Prices Plummet; Rice Shops Sell Hong Kong Rice with Wooden Signs; Public Works Department Hopes Citizens Will Buy Affordable Rice

According to the Public Works Department's announcement, all rice shops that sell the bureau's foreign rice have a wooden sign at the entrance, with the words "This store sells the Public Works Department's foreign rice, today's market price is 110 yuan per stone" in Chinese and English (see attached photo), in order to indicate that each rice shop has agreed to sell foreign rice in accordance with the bureau's regulations. It is hoped that citizens will assist the bureau in purchasing this rice from each rice shop.

All Rice Shops Selling Must Register

A few days ago, the Liki Foreign Firm, upon receiving instructions from the Public Works Department, customized a registration form for each rice shop selling Hong Kong rice, containing six items: (1) store name, (2) address, (3) license number, (4) average monthly rice sales in 1940, (5) foreign rice sold by the Public Works Department today, and (6) signature of the store owner. The Liki Foreign Firm has completed the processing of this registration form, with a total of more than 700 copies, which were sent to the Public Works Department for review yesterday afternoon and should be distributed to each rice shop today. Each book contains 60 pages of forms and is numbered, enough for each rice shop to use for two months. It is reported that each rice shop will send the completed forms to the Liki Foreign Firm every week for reference.

Weight Refund to Start Next Week

A total of 743 local firms ordered the first batch of Hong Kong rice. As of yesterday, more than 570 firms had paid Xianmao Foreign Firm, and there are still more than 170 firms, which are expected to be completed within this week. As for the rice shops that go to the warehouse to pick up the goods, if the weight of a small number of them is less than 224 pounds, they should bring the weight slip to Xiangmao Foreign Firm for a refund. The foreign firm has not yet completed the payment procedures, so the weight refund procedure will start next Monday. Each rice shop can keep the weight slip and go for a refund next Monday.

The Source of Foreign Rice is Increasing

Since the two concession authorities actively dredged the source of foreign rice, the number of rice ships has increased. The production prices in foreign rice producing areas such as Saigon, Siam, and Yangon have fallen sharply, and the amount of rice shipped to Shanghai from various domestic rice producing areas has increased. In the past month, the average daily amount of rice shipped to Shanghai has been more than 20,000 bags. The rice stock has recently increased to more than 2.2 million bags. According to rice industry news yesterday, the transaction volume has been quite large compared to the past due to the low price of foreign rice. The Sarrant ship, managed by the Zhuanghualun Foreign Firm, carrying 25,000 bags of tribute rice, is expected to arrive in port today. It is said that it is part of the first batch of low-priced rice ordered by the French Concession Public Works Bureau from Vietnam, but the French side has not yet confirmed it.

Rice Weevils Raise Rice Prices

Since the Public Works Department handled the sale of Hong Kong rice, rice prices have plummeted. According to statistics, the highest foreign rice has fallen from 165 yuan per bag to 111 yuan in half a month, a huge drop of 54 yuan. The authorities' main purpose of suppressing rice prices has been achieved, but the general rice weevils are all panicked, fearing that the Public Works Department's foreign rice will become more and more, so they have been trying to sell it off in recent days. However, the market is full of spot goods, and no one cares, so their embarrassment can be imagined. Who knows, yesterday, they tried to reverse the decline again, using the excuse that Yongdi was purchasing from Shanghai, and some people even attempted to smuggle it out of the country for domestic sales. Rice prices were arbitrarily raised by 4 or 5 yuan. Saigon No. 1 rose from 111 yuan to 116 yuan, and Xiaojiaomi rose from 103 yuan to 107 yuan.

A Flash in the Pan Has No Impact

It is reported that this phenomenon is a flash in the pan, because the price of the Public Works Department's foreign rice is determined by the authorities, and the rise and fall of the market price has no impact on it. If the rice weevils raise the price, then residents can buy the Public Works Department's foreign rice. Moreover, the quantity of the Public Works Department's foreign rice sold by each rice shop must be registered daily, so it will not flow into the hands of hoarders. Therefore, the reactionary situation of rice prices yesterday is nothing more than a last gasp. It is also reported that various factories and firms in this city can order the Public Works Department's foreign rice from the Liki Foreign Firm.

### Owner of Tao Tao Sock Factory Accused of Bigamy - Abandoning His Wife to Marry a Prostitute, First Wife Works as a Helper and Reports to Police for Justice

Tao Zikang, 34 years old, a native of Shaoxing and currently the owner of the Tao Tao Sock Factory under the Mao Xing Transportation Company, residing at 175 Rue Cardinal, was originally poor. Sixteen years ago, he took Sun Fuying (35 years old), also from Shaoxing, as his wife. They had one daughter, now 15 years old, and adopted a son, now 9 years old.

Jobless and Destitute

After the Shanghai War, Tao came to Shanghai with Sun, initially living at the home of a friend, Mr. Li, at 20 Shou'an Lane, Baixian Bridge. This Mr. Li ran an escort agency at the Far Eastern Hotel. Because Tao was unemployed at the time, Li had him work as an accountant at the agency. Wang Ying, a prostitute at the agency, developed feelings for Tao due to their daily interactions, and they became lovers. Once Tao found this new love, he drove his wife, Sun Fuying, out of the house. Sun, left with little choice, worked as a helper to make a living.

With the help of this magnate, Tao transported three ships of ham from Hangzhou to Shanghai, becoming an overnight success. He specialized in the transportation business, going from modest prosperity to wealth. He then invested in and opened the Tao Tao Sock Factory, etc.

In order to reward Yang Yuying for her efforts, he formally married Yang at the Yi Pin Xiang Hotel on March 13th of this year, with Mr. Wen Lanting as the officiant. Famous opera singers performed all day at the wedding reception. He never once thought about how his first wife was living under someone else's roof, working as a helper to make a living. Unexpectedly, Sun found out about this and collected evidence to report to the Huishi Police Station.

Accused of Bigamy

After investigation, Chinese Detective Feng Baishun learned that Tao was hosting a banquet at the Lianxiang Brothel, 19 Huile Lane. He then ordered Chinese Detective Huang Fusen, Detective Liang Yuliang, and Officer Yang Xichen to go there and arrest Tao, who was then sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court.

### Grain: A Centipede Dies Hard - Speculators Attempt a Comeback - Shipping to Ningbo Area Hoping for Doubled Profits - Rice Prices Rise Another Five, Seven, or Eight Yuan from Previous Day - A Reader Sends a Letter Requesting Sample Rice Display

Imported rice continues to arrive. The Taikoo Company's Jiaying wheel brought 21,004 bags of Shanghai Municipal Council imported rice from Hong Kong. The Yuezhou also brought 4,302 bags of imported rice. Both wheels arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 18th) and berthed at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng wheel also arrived the day before yesterday (the 18th), bringing 10,000 bags of Shanghai Municipal Council imported rice, berthing at the Weissfuh Wharf for unloading. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel arrived in Shanghai, also transporting 10,000 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong, berthing at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (Zu)

Yesterday's market for imported rice was invigorated by Ningbo merchants, who could obtain doubled profits in the Ningbo area. The market atmosphere immediately became tense, and all imported rice merchants were thriving. The dispirited mood of brokers and agents for several days suddenly changed to a lively smile. The price of rice had plummeted for days, dropping by 40 to 50 yuan. Major merchants and wealthy households still had rice stored from last year's low prices. Even with the higher prices, their costs were still less than 100 yuan. A drop of 40 to 50 yuan was not a concern. However, general speculators and those with insufficient capital had seen their assets vanish and were in dire straits. Therefore, they were still trying to salvage their situation in a final struggle, seeking a way out and waiting for an opportunity. Real consumers and new buyers were also quietly waiting for the opportunity to arrive. Now that the market price has fallen below the Shanghai Municipal Council's standard and reached a certain point, they immediately began buying. Ningbo merchants had the greatest appetite, buying five or six thousand yuan. Other inland merchants also bought three or four thousand bags. Local businesses also added to their purchases, and new speculators joined in. The market price rose immediately, then steadily increased. Small Jiaoxi rice opened at 105 yuan, then increased from 5 jiao to 1 yuan, reaching 109 yuan. Saigon No. 1 rose from 113 yuan to 117 yuan. Min Dang rose from 105 yuan to 110 yuan. Mi Lu 87 yuan, broken rice 81.25 yuan. Yinghua Si original bags were popular, broken rice 99 yuan to 100 yuan, April-May 99 yuan to 102 yuan, Small Jiaoxi April-May 133 yuan, Saigon 136.5 yuan to 138 yuan, an increase of 5, 7, or 8 yuan compared to last weekend. The after-hours market even tightened by another one or two yuan, with 20,000 bags of spot rice changing hands, Yinghua Si 1,500 to 1,600 tons.

Our newspaper received a letter from a reader yesterday saying: I want to tell the truth. Despite my financial difficulties, I still subscribe to the Shen Bao and the ×× Daily. I read the Shen Bao for its editorials and the "Sixty Years Ago" stories. When the delivery person occasionally replaces it with the ×× newspaper, I insist on no substitution. If I miss a day, I still need to get a replacement. And if I want to understand everything about... and its little anecdotes, I subscribe to the ×× Daily. Now I have a recent matter to ask you to answer:

(1) The name newspaper focuses its criticism on unscrupulous merchants, but the Shen Bao's editorials are ironic and mocking, allowing one to understand the meaning implicitly. The Shanghai Municipal Council, under the urging of public opinion, did obtain Hong Kong rice. However, at the crucial moment, it still left room for maneuver. Does the gentleman know this? I remember that in the gentleman's Shen Bao editorial, there was a proposal to display rice samples in glass cases in front of the store so that buyers could make comparisons. This is an essential measure.

(2) Now that it is time to implement this measure, there is absolutely no mention of this essential measure. The so-called "one yuan one jiao" rice in the rice shops is easily the most inferior rice, and the rice that is truly obtained from Hong Kong becomes just another way for unscrupulous merchants to make more money. If there is such a fickle behavior, then the measures originally intended to stabilize society cannot be carried out to the end and become something regrettable and hateful.

(3) Therefore, at the final crucial moment (i.e., when selling), strict supervision should be carried out. Those who only seek profit, like the wicked beggars who catch snakes and frogs, should be condemned in writing and speech. Those who sincerely want to stabilize society, like Guang Sheng, are like the old women who buy and release snakes and frogs. Based on past events, I have this worry. I hope I am wrong. I respectfully hope that the gentleman will also pay attention to this to avoid failure at the last step.

Editor's Note: I have seen that the rice shops in the French Concession have labeled each rice box, clearly stating the price. Although there are no rice samples on display, it is more complete than simply hanging a paper sign. Buyers can easily compare the rice samples and prices displayed by each rice shop, which reduces the possibility of rice merchants deceiving customers. This is an easy thing to do, and the Public Concession could easily imitate it. If sample rice display can be done, it will not only benefit customers but also eliminate the mixing of inferior rice.

Thick and Thin Geng Rice and other domestic rice are rarely available. Now that imported rice is rising again, the owners' minds are firm, shouting for higher prices. At the same time, the local shops' appetites are also strong, and the market is recovering accordingly. The prices of both thick and thin rice have recovered to the early prices of the previous week. Wuxi White Geng is quoted at 135 yuan, Kun Geng at 132 yuan to 130 yuan, South Hongzao (early) and late rice initially opened at 128 to 129 yuan, later reaching 132 yuan, original bags 135 yuan, a rebound of 2 to 3 yuan.

Although glutinous rice has also gradually risen, it is difficult to compete with other goods due to its limited sales. The price has only increased by one or two yuan. Hong Kong white opened at 110 yuan, 109 yuan.

### Flour: Active Sales

The foreign flour market, after a sharp drop last week, opened yesterday with a good situation. Due to the active sales of Yantai merchants and the rebound of rice prices, people were quite hopeful for higher prices for a while. Many local speculators took this opportunity to buy. Jinlong brand Kan flour jumped to the 30 yuan mark, a sharp increase of 1.4 yuan compared to last week's low price. The Pao Tai brand American flour also broke the 30 yuan mark, reaching 30.05 yuan. However, the market soon loosened, because the rise was too rapid and the sales were hesitant. Therefore, Jinlong flour returned slightly to 29.5 yuan in the afternoon, and Pao Tai flour also rose sharply and retreated quickly. As a result, it rose by 7 or 8 jiao compared to last week. Flower, Bird, Clock Tower flour and Caishen brand, etc., also tightened by about half a yuan. A total of 25,000 to 26,000 bags were traded in the city. The flat-selling flour from the Chinese factories remained unchanged, while the retail price of the factory's Lao Che brand was 33.5 yuan per bag, and Bingchuan and Fuxin brand were 31.5 yuan per bag. Flat-selling goods are not included in this category. Wheat had no market.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Cakes Fluctuate Greatly

Yesterday's market for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes continued the potential of the previous weekend. Rumors of rising rice prices caused unrest. Various market prices continued to rise. Soybean oil rose by four or five yuan (price details in the market price column). 120 barrels of Dalian oil were traded, 100 dan of Daya Oil, peanut oil also increased by two yuan in the limited purchase and sale (opened 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil), yellow soybeans were sluggish. Although the oil mills and local markets inquired, they would not buy unless it was cheap. Therefore, the market atmosphere remained undeveloped. Yesterday, the factories sold over 1,000 bags of Guide soybeans and over 300 bags of Tianjin soybeans. Corn was the opposite of the previous situation, with a strong buying momentum. The market price rose sharply by about 3 yuan compared to Saturday, but it fell back slightly at the close. 3,000 bags of spot goods were opened, and 200 tons of futures. The soybean cake "kick the ball" transaction was very popular, with many fluctuations throughout the day. The market price fluctuated greatly. The Shin Kee spot cake was opened at 2,000 pieces (March warehouse receipt), and the futures cake was over 20,000 pieces. The market was 19.5 yuan for the April 15th warehouse receipt ordered to be delivered in the lower May, and the May lower warehouse receipt ordered to be delivered in the upper June ranged from 21.5 yuan to 5.5 jiao, turned down to 0.075 jiao, and then increased to 1.12 jiao. Such sudden ups and downs were dazzling. The final closing price was 1 yuan.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Spot and Futures Even

The foreign exchange market yesterday. The HSBC listed prices for various exchanges remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchanges showed hardening for the June American dollar, with the remaining trend sluggish and stable. The rumors of the United States mediating the Sino-Japanese war caused Chinese speculators to supply. The gold price also fell, making 5.375 yuan difficult to sell. The price was sluggish in the afternoon due to limited transactions. Finally, only the June American dollar was longer at 0.03125, at 5.375 yuan, which was cheaper than the spot price. The remaining prices and the British exchange were even. Transactions were sparse.

The Situation is Stabilized and Stable

Since the morning, the foreign news from the silver market showed that the British and American were closed, and Indian silver was slightly reduced. The international exchange rate of British to Shanghai was longer at 0.03125, with the remainder flat. The bank's selling price for the opening of the domestic market was 3 shillings and 2.8125 pence for the spot British exchange, and 5.34375 yuan for the American dollar, the same as the closing price of the previous day. Speculators came again to sell this month's American dollar at a premium of 5.375 yuan to the Bank of China. The situation was stable. HSBC's listed price did not change. The silver balance tax was still 24.50%. The June 5.375 yuan was difficult to sell and could be closed. Near noon, a certain foreign bank entered 15,000 US dollars for June 5.375 yuan, which was supplied by the money changers and returned to even, but soon loosened again to be closed. The market closed with the spot British exchange still at 3 shillings and 2.8125 pence, and the American dollar spot and May at 5.34375 yuan, June at 5.375 yuan, 0.03125 longer than the close of the June American dollar last Saturday.

The United Note black market was cheaper at 1.75 yuan, at 55.75 yuan.

### The Gold Market Has Downward Potential - Spot Goods Uniquely Increased

The gold market's black market yesterday. The variability was still weak. The overall situation was downward. There were rumors that the Soviet Union commented that the Japanese side needed the United States to mediate the war, which was even more urgent. The distant month American exchange rate tended to loosen, causing the firmness and high prices around last weekend's noon closing to be weakened by all parties. Although HSBC Shinfong Yong still aggressively increased its position, the supply from securities and silver firms was more than the demand, and retail investors all had a short mentality. The price retreated from 6,470 yuan at the morning opening to 6,432 yuan in the afternoon. Finally, Deda Gold Store aggressively entered, slightly saving the downward trend, closing at 6,450 yuan, again 13 yuan less. Compared to last weekend's closing price, it was 30 yuan less. A total of 30,000 taels were traded throughout the day. Cash gradually increased. HSBC Shinfong Yong sold 90 taels, the price was 130 yuan higher than the futures delivery price. Hong Kang Yong sold 110 taels, 240 yuan higher, all bought by Chengji. Later, Defu sold 50 taels, Fang Wuxia 30 taels, Baocheng Gongji 20 taels, all 295 yuan higher. No trading was heard in the afternoon. The price was 240 yuan higher than the futures delivery price, a slight increase of several yuan. Jewelry remained flat, listing at 690 yuan. (May turned to June swap, the seller posted 55 yuan to the buyer in the afternoon, and dozens of taels were traded.)

Smelted Gold Decreased 13 Yuan

The June futures opened at 9:15 AM, for 6,470 yuan, 7 yuan higher than last Saturday's noon closing. Yida and Yu Tai Fung came to sell, and it immediately retreated to 6,450 yuan. Chengji, Chengda, and Xinyuan came to enter, raising it to 6,470 yuan, sold by Tong Kang Yong and Heng Ji Lianxing. Then it was suppressed again. The news that the June US dollar of 5.375 yuan could be settled also caused Yili, Yida, Rencheng and Yong to sell, dropping to 6,442 yuan. Shinfong Yong and Defu absorbed it. The noontime was slightly pulled up, and noon closed at 6,451 yuan, 47-48 yuan after closing. In the peaceful atmosphere in the afternoon, the price continued to fall. The opening at 2:00 PM was 6,435 yuan, 16 yuan lower than the noon closing. Under the selling pressure of various households, it fell to 6,432 yuan. Yida, Tong Kang Yong, Dafeng, and Heng Ji came to buy, and slowly rose to 6,445 yuan. Chengji and Shinfong Yong sold, retreating twice to 6,432 yuan. Deda bought, and retail shorts also absorbed it. Therefore, the closing price at 4:00 PM rose to 6,450 yuan, 13 yuan lower than last Saturday's noon closing. According to the June US dollar of 5.375 yuan, the settlement price was 6,479 yuan, a premium of 29 yuan. 6,447-48 yuan after closing. There was a difference of 38 yuan throughout the day. The gold price of the cash shops was 250 yuan higher than the closing price of the smelted futures, and the purchase price was 60-70 yuan lower than the selling price. The existing standard gold still had no price and no market.

Jewelry Gold Unchanged

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in Datong and the new counterparts remained listed at 690 yuan, with a purchase discount of 40 yuan.

### Gold Pound Uniquely Rises 2 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market. Although the market price of smelted gold tended to soften slightly, the British and American gold pounds each rose by 2 yuan. British gold bills tended to soften slightly. American gold bills opened at 0.35 yuan, retreated to 0.28 yuan, and finally closed at 8.3 yuan, a fall of 3 fen compared to last week. Hong Kong bills were stable, Singapore bills and Robbie Cana, Philippines, etc. bills all tended to rise slightly. Only Annam bills were weak, and Japanese gold bills and Korean bills all tended to fall. The former advanced and retreated to 2.05 yuan, and the latter fell to 1.75 yuan.

### Securities: Public Bonds Slightly Strengthened in the Afternoon

The public bond black market yesterday. The market situation was extremely peaceful in the morning. It was slightly improved in the afternoon due to news. It was rumored that Japan persuaded the United States to mediate the Sino-Japanese war, but the United States denied this. This kind of rumor shows that it is a one-sided wishful thinking, too far from the facts. The impact on the market was also very limited. The reason why public bonds increased by 2 to 3 jiao was also a part of the buying. The old bulls took the opportunity to come out again, still no more than a maneuvering situation. Tong Kang and Dechang bought in the morning, Jiu Cheng, Yong Fu, and Lianhe sold, and the market price was stable, without much difference. In the afternoon, Lianhe widely bought, and fifty0,000 of the C bond penetrated the 6 yuan mark again. Defu, Tong Kang, Lianyi, and Yongchang supplied, and Yichang and Qianyi still sold, bought by Dechang and Yizhong. The market situation was still a maneuvering and soft trend. As a result, it unanimously returned to good, increasing by 1.5 to 5 jiao, with a turnover of about 2.2 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:

Stock trading, the championship stock was 50 garden stocks, priced at 90 yuan. The foreign stock market situation of the Public Association was still in an unremarkable process. The trading was sluggish, and the price was only slightly up or down compared to last week.

The British Zeng Paper Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay an interim dividend as of the end of June 1942, which is 2 jiao 5 fen per share in national currency.

### Cotton Yarn: Actual Sales Remain as Dull as Before, Yarn Market Declines

The yarn market is spiraling downwards because actual transactions are not progressing at all, leading to discouragement. However, wealthy firms are absorbing large quantities and firmly holding onto them, so despite large-scale selling by the "Gold Gang" and securities firms, there is a lack of actual goods for delivery. Therefore, the bulls are taking advantage of this point to tighten their grip, not only not releasing positions during declines but instead adding to them, supporting the market on the surface. However, in terms of the overall environment, the market is not optimistic. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn reached a high price of 1,485 yuan and a low price of 1,464 yuan. In the early afternoon, it initially traded at 1,465 yuan, then fell to 1,460 yuan, rebounded to 1,470 yuan, and the final price was 1,469 yuan.

"Double Horse" opened strong in the morning, with bullish sentiment still tight. The opening price was 1,483 yuan, and it soon rose to 1,485 yuan. However, at this 500 yuan level, new buyers were scarce, and long-term holders began to sell, slightly loosening the supply of shares, causing it to weaken to 1,474 yuan. But some scalpers came back to buy and cover short positions, pushing it up again to 1,481 yuan. Unexpectedly, actual sales remained as dull as ever, prices of miscellaneous brands did not rise, and sellers were more numerous, leading to a further decline to 1,464 yuan. The closing price rebounded to 1,469 yuan. The total trading volume for the half-day was 13,130 bales. The amounts bought by various groups are listed separately as follows:

### Fine Cotton Mills Show Slight Improvement

The raw cotton situation remains as stagnant as ever, and mill demand is not strong. However, there is a growing interest in fine cotton of suitable quality. Industry sentiment is still good. Taicang cotton is priced at 215 yuan, with slight transactions reported.

### Piece Goods: Price Fluctuations Depend on Actual Sales Volume

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market fluctuated, and the trend remained weak. However, cloth prices varied depending on actual sales volume. White coarse cloth was the strongest. Ewo Factory's heavy and light weight materials (rose in price by (every bolt) 2.5 jiao, coarse twill remained flat, fine twill fell 2.5 jiao, and fine cloth fell about 5 jiao. Runcang and Ewo Factory's bleached and dyed cloth remained firm, while other goods generally fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao. The street traded over 500 pieces of various cloths, mostly coarse cloth and coarse twill. Cantonese, Hong Kong, and Nanyang merchants purchased several hundred pieces of Ewo and Runcang Factory's bleached and dyed coarse cloth.

Eastern Cloth: Customer sales are declining daily, and the market continues to soften. Futures of middle-grade fine cloth fell (per bolt) 3 to 5 jiao. The spot market also fell about 5 jiao due to weak demand for middle-grade fine cloth and fine twill. However, top-grade "Dragon Head" fine cloth factory orders still require 47.6 yuan in the after-market closing price. Four Gentlemen Drill is priced at 1.48875 yuan.

### Panic Falling Prices for Pallicis are Especially Severe

Recently, items such as Pallicis, feather woolen cloth, Wanliding, Fat Skin, and Baleen have all been experiencing declines. The price drop of Pallicis is especially severe. Although the actual sales of Baleen, Fat Skin, Wanliding, and feather woolen cloth are good, the inventory is quite high. Moreover, it is now approaching the Dragon Boat Festival, and the sales season is already halfway over. Buyer demand is not as strong as it was last month, and sellers have relatively abundant stock compared to other items. If orders are delayed, they must be stored for another ten months. The future of the maritime woolen market and domestic and international situations ten months from now are difficult to predict. Therefore, everyone is willing to actively lower prices for the aforementioned goods, and prices are declining accordingly. In addition to the above reasons, Pallicis production from factories has been continuous, with Shifeng, Yuanfeng, Zhanghua, Hualun, and Shanghai all producing, leading to an even weaker trend, with a tendency to become cheaper as prices fall.

### Sugar Market: Futures for Coarse White Sugar Rise by 7 Jiao

Yesterday morning, the sugar market was closed due to the settlement date for coarse white sugar futures on the 20th. In the afternoon, only trading in coarse white sugar futures for the end of the month occurred, and the trend was flat, initially firm then weakening, with little fluctuation. The guild's settlement price for coarse white sugar futures at the end of May initially rose several jiao, to 108.5, .2, .8, .8.1 yuan, then softened and slightly declined several jiao to 107.9, .6, .7, .5, .6, .5, .4, .3, .2, .1, .2 yuan, and closed at 7.3 yuan, down 7 jiao from the previous day. On the 19th, a ship arrived from Hong Kong carrying 15,350 bales.

### Hardware: Demand for 35-Pound Tinplate Gradually Emerging from Factories

Thirty-five pound tinplate, which has been quiet for a long time, saw factories begin to take action yesterday. However, sales to customer merchants remain sluggish, so transactions are still rare. This product is divided into 14x20 inch and 20x28 inch sizes, with each box containing 175 sheets and 195 sheets respectively. The weight per box is 105 pounds and 118 pounds (the number of sheets for 14x20 inches is doubled, but the weight is the same). In the past, this product was imported only from the United Kingdom and the United States. However, recently, British goods have disappeared, and there is concern that American goods will also become unavailable. Therefore, industry sentiment is still strong due to the thin inventory in the market. Yesterday's selling price was still 750 yuan per box, and there was concern that no goods could be purchased. It is reported that only about 20 boxes were sold throughout the city yesterday. Its primary use is for the thin lids of cigarette tins, followed by biscuit tins and paint tins.

Academic Lecture

### How to Study Paintings (I)

— Shi Chongpeng

I. Why Study Paintings?

Before discussing how to study paintings, we must first ask why we study paintings and what its purpose is. Once we understand this, discussing the study will be more interesting. We know that paintings are art, and art can inspire great talent and cultivate character. The purpose of education is nothing more than to seek knowledge and cope with the environment. In addition to rational and utilitarian considerations, it should also inspire talent and cultivate virtue, and paintings are the best tool for inspiration and cultivation. For example, natural science is too dry, so we use the appreciation of paintings to adjust our mental depression. Reason is too realistic, so we use the power of paintings to escape the shackles of utilitarianism. Therefore, great philosophers, great scientists, great politicians, and great writers, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, all have artistic cultivation and the nourishment of paintings. Newton, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Tagore, Confucius, Mencius, Lao Tzu, Zhuang Tzu, as well as Wang Weimojie and Su Dongpo, all studied paintings, allowing their outstanding talents to be fully developed, their sharp thoughts to be purely tempered, and their great undertakings to be precisely accomplished. To put it more narrowly, general subjects are either biased towards using the brain or the hands, but studying paintings involves observing objects, describing outlines, applying colors, and distinguishing between beauty and ugliness, using both the "brain" and the "hands" at the same time, and combining thought and action in a comprehensive way, which can achieve dual effects. As for painters who study for life, inspiring humanity with art, promoting politics and religion, and passing on their names to future generations, such as Leonardo and Raphael in the Western Renaissance, Ingres in the 19th century, and Wu Daozi in the Tang Dynasty, Dong Beiyuan in the Song Dynasty, Ni Yunlin in the Yuan Dynasty, Tang Bohu in the Ming Dynasty, and Wang Shigu in the Qing Dynasty, the examples are too numerous to mention, all of whom are experts in their fields.

II. What is the Content of Paintings?

Now that we understand the purpose of studying paintings, the second step is to understand the content of paintings. The world's painting systems can be divided into two: one is the Eastern painting system, and the other is the Western painting system. The Western painting system sprouted and grew on the Italian Peninsula in Europe, branched out to other parts of Europe, and in the last one or two centuries, it has been transplanted to various federations in the Americas and spread to East Asia at the same time. The Eastern painting system originated in mainland China, and on the one hand, it was influenced by West Asia and India, undergoing considerable changes, and then it spread to Japan via Korea. For thousands of years, Eastern and Western paintings have developed their own national characteristics, customs, and habits, and each has its own achievements. In recent centuries, due to the development of transportation, a phenomenon of mutual harmony has arisen. Now, separating from the content and form, I will say, one, Chinese paintings are divided into figure paintings (including Buddha statues, portraits of ladies, etc.), landscape paintings (including landscape, travelogue characters, scenery, etc.), sketch paintings (including flowers, birds, fish, insects, and animals, etc.), and miscellaneous paintings (including historical figure paintings, wall paintings, etc.). Before the Tang Dynasty, there were only figure paintings. Landscape paintings were invented after the Tang Dynasty. After the Five Dynasties, Song, and Yuan Dynasties, landscape paintings have been regarded as the orthodox genre. As for the production of sketch paintings, (Chinese books refer to sketch paintings, referring to flowers and birds, etc., which is also different from the sketch paintings in Western paintings), it was still after the Song and Yuan Dynasties, just like the situation of Western paintings, where there were only figure paintings before the 19th century, and landscape paintings only appeared after the 19th century.

War

### Scientific Invention Warfare

— Pan Li

The war between Britain and Germany today is not only a military positional war or a naval and air war, but also a political war, an economic war, a production war, a blockade war, or a war of nerves. We can understand that this is also a war between British and German scientists and inventors by looking at the following facts that have occurred since the outbreak of the European war.

Shortly after the outbreak of the war, the Germans laid magnetic mines on the sea. This new weapon was unprecedented, and many British ships were wrecked. As a result, British scientists were mobilized to study ways to deal with magnetic mines. As a result, the method was researched within nine days, making it impossible for the Germans to use their skills.

In this war, the quality of the bombs dropped by German aircraft has exceeded the expectations of the general public. A small plane can not only carry a large number of bombs, but also has extremely powerful destructive power. In this regard, the British can be said to be self-deprecating. However, British scientists are not willing to give up. They are still working diligently in the laboratory. It is said that they have invented a new type of bomb with fierce explosive power and convenient carrying, which can increase the destructive power of each bomber by 50%. According to the British, the method of making this bomb is strictly confidential, but the bomb itself will exert its power in the coming months.

If this news is true, it is expected that German scientists will certainly not be outdone, and there will be newly invented weapons to resist it. But the civilians in the rear are going to suffer.

Armaments

### Secret Weapons?

— Wang Jiapei

During wartime, scientists in each warring country are doing their utmost to research new weapons, and even ordinary people are sending many fanciful new suggestions to various military agencies.

During the last European war, someone in Britain suggested using a quick-drying cement to spray into the enemy's trenches, instantly making the enemy soldiers "as stiff as a stone." Others advocated turning tanks into giant lawn mowers, fitted with sharp blades on all sides, so that when they rushed into enemy lines, the blades would dance, cutting and killing enemy soldiers like chopping melons and vegetables.

In this European war, Britain received almost three hundred suggestions every week, but less than one percent of them were useful. The following are some interesting suggestions and inventions from all parties during a week in March.

(1) British aviation expert Noel Bering criticized the irrationality of turning off the lights during night raids. He advocated that all kinds of powerful lights should be concentrated and shone into the sky, so that the entire attacked area would be like a "sea of light." In this way, the enemy's flares would be useless, and the night raiders would not be able to aim and drop bombs because of the dazzling lights.

(2) News from Zurich, Switzerland, said that the Germans have recently been spraying a chemical agent over general factories, forests, barracks and residences, giving them fire-resistant properties that can resist the incendiary bombs dropped by the British air force.

(3) There is also an invention that the Germans are now able to paint the exterior of submarines in the same color as seawater (originally submarines were gray). Although seawater can change color from time to time and place to place, submarines can use spray guns to finish spraying the paint that matches the color of seawater in an instant when they rise to the surface.

As for the various new suggestions from the British, most of them are for coping with aggression.

(1) Setting up huge magnets in various military fortresses to disrupt the compasses on invading ships, causing them to lose their direction and go astray.

(2) Installing extremely long electric wires on the propellers (commonly known as propellers) of British air force aircraft, so that there is a half-mile-wide "dead net" when flying. This is especially effective in air combat.

(3) Installing high-voltage power grids on thoroughfares to electrocute enemy tank soldiers.

(4) As for the future British attack on the European continent, they can use an amphibious tank, crawl down the sea at the beach of Dover, and sneak all the way through the English Channel, and then suddenly climb ashore when they reach the coast of France, giving the enemy a surprising blow.

### Hoarding Everything

"Why; buy so many coffins, are you doing charity work?"

"No, I think it's great to buy and store a little bit of this stuff, I'm afraid it's going to skyrocket in the future."

(8) Palpable Friendship

When Zhao Yukun followed the nurse surnamed Li into ward number seven, Qiu Haitang's only remaining eye fixed on him without moving. Yukun's gaze naturally focused on Haitang's face, which was covered in gauze. The two remained silent for a full five minutes.

Qiu Haitang's disheveled appearance was within Yukun's expectations, but Yukun's sudden transformation, becoming so haggard and thin, was something his junior brother could not have foreseen.

"Second Brother, how is Meishi?" Qiu Haitang couldn't help but raise his head and ask.

"Very well."

Another minute or two of silence passed.

"Third Brother, congratulations! Haven't you always been reluctant to sing falsetto? From now on, you won't be able to sing even if you want to. It's as if heaven has answered your prayers!" Others grew up eating food, but Zhao Yukun seemed to have grown up joking. Reuniting with his sworn brother in such circumstances, he only said one serious thing before reverting to his usual jesting manner.

Qiu Haitang quickly glanced at him with his right eye, unwilling to let the hospital staff know his true identity. "Is this a hospital or a prison, Third Brother?" Yukun sat on a small chair to the left of the bed, glancing sideways at the female nurse as he asked.

Before Qiu Haitang could understand his meaning and respond, Yukun added one final sentence:

"Why can't you let me talk to him alone?" Qiu Haitang knew he was being difficult again and almost laughed beneath the bandages.

"Because Mr. Zhou's condition is very poor, we need to stay here to take care of him." The female nurse was quite clever. Knowing that Yukun's words were directed at her, she headed towards the door, smiling as she said, "In that case, I can go out and rest for a while. If Mr. Zhou needs anything, please ring the bell!"

"Thank you, thank you!" Qiu Haitang said to her, too late, his voice remaining very weak. (110)

### Hess's Airplane

— Guo Hongdi

When the third leader of Germany, Hess, fled to England by plane, he was riding in a famous German Messerschmitt 110 fighter plane. The plane had many bullet holes, indicating that it had exchanged fire with British planes in the air before.

Recently, the British shot down a German Messerschmitt 110 aircraft, which crashed without any damage. The British Ministry of Aviation specially sent the plane to the United States for research purposes. It was shipped by the cargo ship Montanan, passed through the Panama Canal, and arrived safely in New York on April 5th.

American aircraft engineers, after conducting research, believed that the aircraft was well-made and could compete with the first-class aircraft of Britain and the United States. The aircraft's speed could reach over 365 miles per hour, with a range of 800 miles. It was equipped with four machine guns and two cannons in the front, and a rotating machine gun in the tail. The plane could accommodate three people: a pilot, a radio operator, and a gunner. It had two 1,150-horsepower engines and could be used for combat and protection, and could use low-quality fuel, which was very economical. Its only shortcoming was that the iron plates protecting the aircraft's seats were too thin.

### My Cousin's Letter

— Fei

To avoid unnecessary bombing, our hospital has moved to a location near Chongqing.

Although the facilities are simple, the patients feel very satisfied thanks to the efforts of every doctor and nurse. Most of those admitted here are from the common people. Because of their good health, childbirth is very smooth. In the past two months, we have not encountered a single difficult delivery.

In Shanghai, surgeries and pelvic dissections are too common. Chongqing, due to the concentration of urban people, also frequently performs surgeries. But here, we may forget our delivery skills. The Creator truly does not treat everyone unfairly!

In addition to hospital affairs, we often go out to do some research work.

The people of Sichuan have indeed understood what is meant by national crisis and what is meant by responsibility! Although they are all living below the general standard of living, there is no complaining or sighing. Everyone is standing in their place. What they expect is light: their belief is victory!

Although prices are high, the general public has universally become accustomed to thrift. With patched clothes, they can still attend meetings. Visiting guests, they do not feel poor. My coat is so tattered that I would have replaced it with a new one in Shanghai, but the "at least one thousand yuan" price has inspired me to abandon my aesthetic views. A tattered coat can still keep me warm. Who dares to look down on me?

I can't even remember the scent of Bai Yu Shuang and Sanhua powder. My colleagues all use local honey, never apply powder, and their shiny faces are a hundred times more energetic!

We are now planning our summer attire:

Everyone will wear short shirts and shorts, bare legs, and shoes woven from waste cloth in an openwork style. I think there is not enough beauty, but there is plenty of 'modernity'!

Truly, there is freedom and soul here! We can run, we can sing! I forgot that I am a medical doctor, I am the director of obstetrics, I only feel that I am a child, an angel spreading joy!

Entertainment

### Chaplin on Wartime Cinema and Its Future

— Qing Hui

Wartime Only Needs Entertaining Comedies - War Films Should Be Made After Peace

In Chaplin's reception room, beautiful sunlight streamed in from the window, reflecting a bright golden color on the walls. Sitting at the table was a small man with gray hair and a short mustache on his lip. At first glance, one might almost mistake him for "The Great Dictator" Hitler. Looking again, it turned out that Hitler's mustache was the same as his. Chaplin was draped in a black coat, his eyes shining brightly. After a long silence, he began to speak to the reporters.

"Every war in Europe will have some impact on the world. This European war, being so fierce, will naturally have a significant impact on Hollywood. It makes us more aware of the public's problems and gives us an international perspective. It also makes the people of Hollywood realize that Hollywood is, after all, a part of America and not some secluded paradise that can be unaffected by war. Although we are not directly involved in the whirlpool of war, we are greatly affected economically and emotionally. The commercial situation of our country will change as a result, and Hollywood cannot be an exception."

"The direct impact of the war," he continued, "is to introduce more humorous material on the screen, not only for the troubles of the people and soldiers at home but also abroad. Only when we reach a time of peace can we offer more tears. So once the peace treaty is signed, we will have many great war films. If it doesn't end, then entertaining comedies will continue. Because the audience's psychology when watching films is for entertainment, not for news. Reporting news is the job of newspapers and radio, while the art of film is based on action and emotion."

"In addition, I can predict that in 1942, many small companies will be established in Hollywood. Based on a spirit of cooperation, they will produce excellent films that can meet the needs of the times, fully conform to social psychology, and make the film industry more important and universal than it is today. What these creators try will be beyond the dreams of those large companies now. The same is true for stars. At that time, we certainly need outstanding figures, such as Bette Davis, Garbo, Spencer Tracy, and others' art, but we also need stars with modern awareness. As long as they can fit the times, they can become good actors."

"At the same time, movie fans will become more demanding. War will become the central topic of conversation. Economic waves in society may not seem to greatly affect personal life on the surface, but later, these economic fluctuations will affect all countries in the world. No one knows what will happen in the future. We stand in a transitional era. The future depends entirely on what we do now, but as a rule, after a major war, there will be a huge change in each society, so in a few years, life in Hollywood will also change greatly."

"As for me," Chaplin said with a playful smile, "my future plans are not yet certain. It is difficult to fix a path in business. In short, I love Hollywood, I love movies, and I love my friends, but I don't really like its atmosphere. In the eyes of Los Angeles businessmen, I may be a weirdo! But what I seek is permanent light."

### New Camille

— Liu Liu

Li Lihua is a multifaceted actress? She can play many different roles, many different emotional dramas. In "New Camille," she plays both a country girl and an urban girl. Because of the different identities, there are many different emotions, such as happiness, sadness, worry, and melancholy. In the film industry of 1941, Li Lihua will be one of the most successful actors.

The cast of "New Camille" includes Li Lihua, Zheng Zhong, Zhang Cuiying, Guan Hongda, Fan Xuepeng, Yan Hua, etc. (The picture above shows the expressions of Li and Zheng.)

### Symphony of Film and Drama

— Bai Ding

Han Langen and Yin Xiucen were originally just a pair of clowns who simply created some humorous laughs on the screen. Recently, however, because they starred in Wu Yonggang's "Souls of the Sea of People," the story of which is also mainly based on humor, the entire theme strongly gives a humorous satire and criticism of the deformed system of society. They were greatly moved, and the two jointly thought about a comedy story with the same meaning. The play is tentatively titled "Shanghai Gold Rush." Yin Xiucen personally wrote the outline, and the full dialogue and stage directions were entrusted to Pei Chong.

The Tianfeng Drama Troupe's "Under the Eaves of Shanghai," directed by Wu Fuzhi, will be performed in various local dialects. The principle is that the population is concentrated in Shanghai from all over the country. If "Mandarin is unified," it is inevitable that some people will not understand, and it is questionable whether everyone in a house can speak Mandarin? By analogy, Tianfeng's past performances of "Crossroads" and the Shanghai Art Theater's current performance of "City of Sorrow" seem to all need to abandon Mandarin due to their depiction of Shanghai and perform them in various local dialects. In this way, the civilization of spoken drama can be promoted and expanded!

The United Company, supported by Zhu Shilin, is inclined to costume films, so after "Princess Bi Luo," it plans to shoot another costume film of the same nature. The script is being written by Zhu Shilin. However, Wang Xichun believes that costume films are already outdated and has expressed his opinion, disagreeing with putting on the costume again and making this kind of so-called costume film that is both outdated and has no historical significance.

Chapter 9 Why Did You Come to the Ends of the Earth

Liu Yin, Ying sighed and said: "This is a long story, but fortunately, Mr. Xu wants to stay here for a few days. Let me slowly tell you about it." Xu Jing didn't dare to force him. He also said: Liu Yin, Ying's marksmanship is excellent, expressing his admiration. Liu Yin, Ying said: "How can the two of us be worth mentioning? Now, General Zhou Yuji, the general soldier of Ningwu, is stationed here, he can be called a hero of this era. There are many talented people under his command. Since he came, bandits in the area have disappeared, the village lanes are peaceful, and who dares to harass even a blade of grass or a tree from afar? The people sing his praises, and their praise spreads far and wide. Such a general is worthy of admiration. I heard that the roving bandits in Shaanxi are very rampant and may invade. I think there will inevitably be some fighting in the Daizhou area. Mr. Xu, with his extraordinary talent, why not join General Zhou's command, work hard for the country, and establish fame? He is currently recruiting talents, so he probably won't refuse. Xu Jing listened to Liu Yin, Ying's words, and he thought to himself that I had just come out from under General Zhou's command, how could he know the pain I had in leaving? So he smiled and said: "Brother Liu is right. I want to take the opportunity to achieve meritorious service, but I'll wait a few days and then go with Brother Liu to visit General Zhou, how about it? Even someone as incompetent as I am is unwilling to be buried, let alone Brother Liu, who is young and handsome, and skilled in martial arts, why hide away, like pearls buried in the great marsh, and paulownia trees hidden in the deep mountains?" Liu Yin, Ying smiled and said: "Thank you very much for Mr. Xu's encouragement. However, I am a very casual person and do not want to be restrained by others, so I have never joined the army. However, I have never lagged behind others in my love for the country, and of course I am willing to work for the country if there is an opportunity." The two were talking enthusiastically when Liu Yin, Ying's aunt, Old Madam Zheng, walked to the door of the study and said: "The guest has come from afar, and I suppose he hasn't had lunch yet. I've specially cooked some noodles that look like dumplings. Please, Mr. Xu, have some as you like." Xu Jing listened and quickly stood up and said: "Oh, you're too kind, old madam." Liu Yin, Ying said: "It should be so, please don't be polite." So he accompanied Xu Jing to the outer parlor, because Liu Yin, Ying had already eaten, so he let Xu Jing eat alone. After Xu Jing finished eating, he thanked the two. Liu Yin, Ying also accompanied Xu Jing to stroll on the ridge and admire the scenery. Xu Jing felt that Liu Yin, Ying's speech was both cheerful and somewhat charming, making people feel as if they were drinking intoxicating wine, and thought that he was truly a descendant of Wang and Xie, free and refined, and difficult to find in this chaotic world. Therefore, he already had several points of admiration in his heart, and also gathered his spirits, and expressed the ambitions in his chest. (67)

### Abstract of Philosophy of Practice

— Zong Yu

The passage of action leads to harmonious results. Great passage leads to great harmony, and small passage leads to small harmony, because the purpose of action is to seek to survive. Seeking to survive for the people of a country, action naturally passes through the country, and the people of the country will be able to live in harmony.
