### Ceasefire Extended for Ten Days; Both Thailand and Vietnam Prepare for Renewed Conflict; Vietnamese Army Headquarters Moves from Hanoi to Saigon; Military Vehicles Constantly Moving towards the Thai Border

Saigon – Yesterday, Japanese sources stated that the French Indochinese military authorities had cancelled all leave for officers and soldiers, ordering them to return to their posts. Reportedly, this move was the result of a meeting held last Friday by senior military officials, who decided to continue the war and prepare to return to Hanoi today. According to Japanese sources, Major General Degoutte hopes to move the Army Headquarters from Hanoi to Saigon, while also preparing to move the Southern Vietnamese Army Command from Saigon to Cambodia to organize new defense measures. Meanwhile, well-informed and authoritative sources say that although there are many points of contention in the Thai-Vietnamese negotiations in Tokyo, they have not yet broken down. Military and political authorities have expressed hope to resolve the disputes before the ceasefire agreement expires tomorrow. However, they are closely monitoring the situation and have indicated that if Thailand insists on its demands, they are prepared to take military action. (United Press report, 24th)

Saigon – Authoritative sources announced today that the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire, which was due to expire tomorrow, will be extended until March 7th. According to Japanese eyewitnesses, since Saturday, military vehicles have been continuously moving towards the Thai border. A French cruiser left Saigon yesterday, and two others sailed out last Saturday, presumably heading for the Gulf of Siam. (United Press report, 24th)

Tokyo – Tonight, the Information Bureau issued a public statement announcing that the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire agreement has been extended for another ten days, until March 7th. It is reported that after the third informal meeting of the conference mediating the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute was held at the Foreign Minister’s residence on February 7th, Japan conducted separate negotiations with representatives from both Thailand and Vietnam. Given that the ceasefire deadline was rapidly approaching and several issues required further discussion, the Japanese representative yesterday, acting as a mediator, requested both parties to extend the ceasefire until noon on March 7th. This request has been accepted by both sides. From 5:00 PM to 6:15 PM today, the representatives of the three parties held the fourth informal meeting at the Foreign Minister's residence, and the discussions were very harmonious. (Reuters report, 24th)

Bangkok – Government officials today predicted that the ceasefire agreement with Vietnam would be extended, and expressed confidence that a peaceful resolution could be achieved. (Saigon sources say the ceasefire has been extended to March 7th.) However, French sources here are not optimistic, predicting that France will refuse to extend the ceasefire agreement again and insisting that France will fight to the death before relinquishing its sovereignty over Vietnam. Amidst the tense atmosphere of war and peace in the Far East, the U.S. Minister to Thailand, Mr. Grant, visited the acting Thai Foreign Minister, Mr. Direck Jayanama, this morning. Unofficial sources are paying close attention to the activities of Japanese warships in the Gulf of Thailand and the actions of the Japanese army in northern Vietnam, apparently believing that the Japanese army will cross Thailand and attack Burma. (United Press report, 24th)

Tokyo – Reports say that the 7,294-ton cruiser "Pittsburgh" and all ships in the fleet have set sail for the Gulf of Siam. Lieutenant General Degoutte, Governor-General of Vietnam, who is currently in Saigon for routine winter inspections, is scheduled to fly back to Hanoi today. (Reuters report, 24th)

### Trade Negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies

Tokyo – According to Japanese sources from Batavia today, despite persistent rumors in the Far East, trade negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies have established a "mutual understanding." The Japanese news agency also stated that as a result of the "understanding established by the Dutch and Japanese representatives," there is optimistic hope for the future of the negotiations.

Thai Officials Say Military Will Still Attack Vietnam if Mediation Fails

mediation to produce good results, but will continue to attack. Throughout this conflict, the Thai army has been waiting for the French army to take the offensive, making careful preparations for defense. However, it finally attacked French territory only after both sides took long-term "retaliatory actions." Military activities are extremely difficult in the dense forests on both sides of the Mekong River. On the French side, the Mekong River, one mile wide, is the first obstacle, and a range of mountains is the second obstacle, both of which can discourage attackers. Only narrow paths are passable through the vine-entangled forests, making it difficult for any but the most determined troops to pass through these obstacles. Therefore, the Thai military does not expect active warfare in this area. Only a few strategically important small towns on both sides of the Mekong River have defenses; the remaining towns are guarded only by a few policemen. The paths connecting the towns, which were originally very narrow, are now being rapidly widened and renovated. Residents of most towns have been ordered to evacuate. Ban Phon, Thailand, was the first town to be bombed by French aircraft, and civilian residences are now prohibited. Mukdahan, further south, has also been evacuated due to repeated shelling by French artillery. Nong Khai, further north, allows civilians to decide their own actions. Ubon Ratchathani, thirty miles from the border, has been bombed several times by French aircraft, and its administrative head has ordered all merchants and shop assistants to return to the city to resume business immediately, otherwise their business licenses will be revoked. The Thai army along the Mekong River receives food supplies from two locations: Udon Thani in the north and Ubon Ratchathani in the south. Both locations are railway hubs, and the French army seems to recognize their importance, having bombed them several times. There are no paved roads in eastern Thailand. Foreign troops invading Thai territory can only follow two routes: one is the highway from Pakse to Ubon Ratchathani, where there is a railway to Bangkok; the other is from Nong Khai and Ban Phon to Udon Thani, where there is also a railway. The Thai military says that troops are concentrated near Aranyaprathet, Poipet, and Trat, and believes that they can resist enemy attacks on the entire border, and if necessary, can occupy the two districts needed by Thailand within 24 hours. (United Press report, 24th)

Chongqing – The Catholic newspaper "Yi Shi Bao" commented today on France's rejection of Japan's proposed mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, saying, "The Vichy government no longer needs to appease Japan." The newspaper strongly stated that Vichy does not need to make concessions to Japan in the Pacific region, as the military deployments of Britain and the United States in the Pacific are now complete. In the past, Japan dreamed of using Vietnam as its starting point, but Vichy's protests surprised Japan and shattered its sweet dreams. Pétain's strong measures have naturally gained some powerful backing. The Netherlands East Indies' protest against the "New Order in East Asia" and France's rejection of the Japanese-proposed peace talks have placed Japan in a dilemma in the South Seas.

Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Declares Strict Monitoring of British and American Actions in Lower House

Tokyo – Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi Tadashi, during a session of the Lower House Public Debt Committee today, commented on Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute and negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies, saying that Japan is now in an advantageous position in all aspects and has a strong army, so Japan is now able to use its diplomatic policies. Ohashi also stated that Britain and the United States have no reason to oppose Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute and Japanese-Dutch commercial negotiations, and Japan will therefore closely monitor the actions of Britain and the United States. During this morning's Lower House meeting, Ohashi also presented a statement on behalf of Matsuoka, saying that the mediation of the war was merely an incidental issue in Matsuoka's reply to British Foreign Secretary Eden. (According to British sources, Matsuoka's note to Eden stated that Japan was willing to mediate wars anywhere in the world.) The main part of Matsuoka's note was that Britain believed Japan had aggressive intentions in the south. Ohashi also stated that British Foreign Secretary Eden had raised concerns with the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu Mamoru, about news of Japanese expansion into the south spreading in Britain, and the Japanese Foreign Minister had instructed Shigemitsu to convey a reply, stating that Britain believed Japan harbored aggressive intentions towards the south, and that the purpose of the Tripartite Pact was to prevent the further expansion of the war. Ohashi generally stated that the Japanese Foreign Minister did indeed inform Eden in the reply that Japan was willing to contribute to ending wars worldwide to the extent possible, and pointed out that Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute was an expression of this desire. However, Matsuoka's reply did not specify that Japan wanted to mediate the European war. Ohashi concluded by saying that Japan would make strong efforts to end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible. (United Press report, 24th)

Japanese Newspaper Criticizes British and American Policies, Saying They Only Serve to Incite Japanese Expansion into South

Tokyo – The "Nichi Nichi" and affiliated newspapers all published articles criticizing Britain and the United States for strengthening their defenses in the Pacific as an unwarranted provocation, and issued a warning that if Japan were forced to fight back, Guam and Singapore would be swept away. They continued that Britain's strengthening of defenses around Singapore in the face of Japan only served to incite Japan's policy of advancing into the south, and had no other benefit. They also constantly spread rumors that the situation in the Far East was deteriorating, and falsely claimed that Foreign Minister Matsuoka's letter to Eden was Japan's offer to mediate the European war. Britain's purpose in doing so was to sow discord between Japan, Germany, and Italy. The Japanese people must remain vigilant against British propaganda. (Reuters report, 24th)

Chongqing – The "Central Daily News" carried a special commentary this morning, stating that the Japanese army is likely to begin its advance into the south in the spring, when the German army launches its offensive in Europe, or slightly later, but it seems inevitable that it will implement its southern advance this year. There has been much discussion about whether Japan will launch an offensive in the South Pacific. Strictly speaking, Japan's occupation of Hainan Island and the Spratly Islands, as well as its involvement in the Vietnamese-Thai dispute, are all necessary preparations for its advance into the south. Currently, discussions about Japan's advance into the south focus on the possibility of the Japanese army attacking Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, either through political and military means, but not including economic aggression. However, we can say that Japan's southern advance has already begun. Those who doubt that Japan will launch an offensive in the South Pacific base their doubts on the following reasons: (1) Japan's policy is always opportunistic. Japan will not rashly attack British territories in the Pacific unless Britain is defeated in the European war. (2) Japan's resources may have been exhausted in the war against China. (3) Soviet-Japanese relations are not completely friendly. (4) Japan's joining the Tripartite Pact may only be a form of intimidation. Japan is well aware that cooperation with Germany and Italy is not beneficial to itself. The result of Japan's joining the Tripartite Pact is to strengthen the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards Japan, and to make the Japanese people oppose this move. Since the Konoe government came to power, Japan has devoted all its efforts to achieving economic self-sufficiency, so Japan will not take any actions that involve significant risks. Furthermore, Japan's recent diplomatic actions, such as appointing Nomura to the United States, sending Sawada to the Dutch East Indies, and exchanging diplomatic representatives with Australia, all indicate that Japan does not want to go to war with Britain and the United States. (Reuters report, 24th)

### Japan Anxious About Recent U.S. Military Preparations

Tokyo – Japanese Vice Minister of the Navy Toyota stated in the Lower House today that although the Japanese Navy does not feel threatened by the recent actions of the United States, Japan has taken necessary countermeasures due to the circumstances. Toyota said, "The Japanese Navy, after fully considering all aspects of the current state of U.S. military preparations in the Pacific, has decided to take appropriate countermeasures." Toyota also stated that the United States is implementing military preparations with the intention of encircling Japan, as can be seen from the recent appropriation of US$4 million to fortify Guam. Guam is only 1,500 miles from southern Japan. (United Press report, 24th)

### Britain Enhances Burma's Defenses with Accumulated Military Supplies; Rumor that U.S. is Considering Taking Over Burma Road; Indian Youths Receive Naval Training

New York – U.S. Senator Nye, a Republican from North Dakota, stated yesterday in a speech to the American Non-Intervention Committee in Chicago that the United States is considering a plan to take over the Burma Road. He also stated that the Washington authorities are now preparing to conduct large-scale naval operations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. (Haitong News Agency report, 24th)

Tokyo – Reliable sources from Burma say that a large amount of military supplies, accumulated in Burma for several months, were originally intended to be transported to Chongqing, but Britain is now using them to enhance Burma's defenses. (Haitong News Agency report, 24th)

Bombay – Four hundred and sixty-eight Indian youths are currently undergoing naval training near Karachi. Sixty of them, receiving training in artillery, engineering, and radio, have been training for eighteen months and will be incorporated into the Indian Navy.

(Reuters report, 24th)

Marseille – Renowned journalist Roland recently published an article in "L'Écho de Paris," emphasizing the strategic and economic importance of the port of Singapore, which he considers even more important than the Suez Canal. He stated that Japan has always regarded the port of Singapore as an obstacle to its advance into the south, and believes that the port threatens Japan's economy. Looking to the future, the interests of the Pacific powers will likely clash in the Strait of Malacca. (Havas report, 24th)

### Swiss Newspaper Examines Far East Situation; Japan Still Cautious About Soviet Union and Dares Not Advance South

Geneva – The "Journal de Genève" recently published an editorial examining the situation in the Far East, stating briefly that Japan's waging war against the United States may not be beyond its capabilities, but Japanese privy councilors are well aware that this action would require the use of the country's entire fleet and the withdrawal of warships currently patrolling the Chinese coast. If Japan could determine that the Soviet Union truly harbored friendly intentions towards Japan, then Japan might disregard all risks, offend President Roosevelt, and boldly advance. While this action is possible, it is not certain, because how can Japan know that the Soviet Union will not attack Japan at a critical moment? It must be known that the Soviet air force, departing from its base at Vladivostok, can easily fly to Japan and bomb important areas. All of these factors will force Japan to concentrate all of its forces in Asia and avoid participating in an "intercontinental" war. As for the possibility of Japan mediating the current European war, since both sides of the current European war believe that victory is certain, Japan is unwilling to formally propose mediation at this time, so as to avoid the humiliation of diplomatic failure. In short, Japan must wait until one or both of the belligerent countries are exhausted and unable to continue fighting before it can offer its services as a mediator. In conclusion, Japan may have an opportunity to offer mediation in the future, because although it has signed treaties of alliance with Germany and Italy, it has not thoroughly become one of the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo axis morally, politically, or geographically.

### U.S. to Freeze Axis Assets in U.S.; U.S. Plans to Freeze Assets If Germany Invades, Finance Minister Will Implement Immediately

Washington – According to well-informed sources here last night, if Germany occupies Romania and Bulgaria, and the U.S. assets in these two countries are frozen, then U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will take strong countermeasures. It is expected that the implementation of this action will force Morgenthau to meet with the U.S. State Department, as Morgenthau has repeatedly proposed freezing the assets of Germany, Italy, and Japan in the U.S. It is understood that the State Department has pointed out that U.S. assets in Germany are greater than the assets of Germany and Italy in the U.S. It is also understood that the U.S. State Department believes that freezing the assets of the Soviet Union and Japan in the U.S. may force them to move further towards the Axis powers.

Editorial

### From Mussolini's Speech to the Future Offensive

The "Blackshirt Duce" Mussolini has not delivered a grand speech for a long time. Unexpectedly, when the Italian army has been repeatedly defeated and there are widespread rumors that the Libyan garrison is preparing to withdraw entirely to French Tunisia, he roared again. Recalling his speech on November 18th of last year, he solemnly declared: "Conquering Greece in three months, or conquering Greece in a year, is of no importance. Fascist Italy is determined to fight to the end to avenge this insult." At that time, the extent to which listeners believed him was certainly far less than his own confidence. But now, the speech has admitted that the Italian army has been fighting unfavorably since the Battle of Taranto, but still expresses that the war against Britain will "not end until the last drop of blood is shed." At the same time, his attitude towards Germany does not resemble someone who should be on equal footing with Germany. Those throughout the world who hear his speech will almost certainly lament in unison at this person who once dominated the world, hailed as a veteran dictator, and now cannot help but feel a sense of beauty fading with age, the sun setting in the west. His words are sometimes arrogant and sometimes humble, but examining his main purpose, it is nothing more than two things: First, to comfort a part of the people and party members who have not completely lost hope in him, in order to continue to drive the masses under Fascist dictatorship, and to find ways to eliminate domestic unrest; second, to tell Hitler that Italy is still willing to accept "leadership" and continue to fight, in order to maintain his ally's trust in him and avoid the ally generating unexpected problems in light of his defeat.

Italy's military incompetence can no longer be concealed. Its relationship with Germany has clearly degraded from a position of equal allied countries to one of reliance on Germany. On this day when Hitler has not figured out how to effectively defeat Britain or figured it out but has not dared to act rashly, Britain is mercilessly launching a multifaceted offensive against Italy, determined not to give up until the Roman government is defeated and bows its head. At the same time, American diplomacy is cleverly attacking Italy's weaknesses. It is rumored that when American Ambassador to Italy Mr. Phillips returned to office, he presented a personal letter from President Roosevelt to the King of Italy, and there were rumors outside that Italy was preparing for a separate peace. Under these circumstances, Mussolini does have a need to try his best to "show his heart" to Hitler. What cannot be done both ways is that in this kind of public speech, he has to lower himself by half a notch and openly admit defeat.

Hitler does not want to feel proud of himself at this time, on the contrary, he must feel sad. He superficially claims to have two major allies: but one of them, the "boot ally" Italy, has become riddled with holes and cannot recover, and will need far more support from Germany than it can help Germany. The second "clay-footed ally" Japan is constrained by the war in China, fearful and hesitant, and refuses to set a fire for him in the South Pacific in a straightforward manner. Allies like this have made the vaunted triangular alliance into a lame axis that cannot stand up straight. Recalling that since Hitler threatened to launch a spring offensive, at least three months have passed, but it has never materialized. This kind of delay in time is a major loss for the Axis, which favors a quick decision. The reason for this is partly due to the increasing strength of the democratic front, but on the other hand, it should undoubtedly be blamed on the outward strength but inward weakness of Italy and Japan. However, it is necessary for Germany, Italy, and Japan to launch an offensive in order to break the current stalemate and save the declining trend, which is truly a situation where they are forced to act and cannot stop. At this moment when the American Lend-Lease Act is about to be established and the democratic front's joint defense movement is advancing steadily, the time that the Axis powers can still delay is "running out." At this fleeting and important moment, we believe that the current task of the democratic front is how to seize the initiative and control the situation. Yesterday's discussion called, "It is not enough to only prevent and contain the offensive that the aggressors are planning, it is necessary to fundamentally eliminate all harmful present situations and sources," we would like to reiterate this again and again to promote the attention and efforts of the democratic countries. Furthermore, closely observing the recent diplomatic and military trends of Germany, Italy, and Japan: such as Hitler's active deployment in the Balkans, preparations for launching a large-scale submarine offensive against Britain, Japan's intensified oppression of Vietnam, and the various facts of Japanese warships patrolling the Gulf of Siam, and then verifying yesterday's speech by Mussolini, in which he spoke of a separate peace and declared that he would fight to the end, it can be seen that although the aggressive front is like the end of a crossbow, it is still longing for the final blow of "joint action." Therefore, the current problem of the democratic countries is only one: to decide whether to wait for the aggressors to choose the timing of the attack, or to strike first? If they wait for them to attack, then since there is no way to know in advance where the aggressors will strike first, they cannot but consider whether the democratic front has sufficient preparation to fight on multiple fronts simultaneously if the Axis powers truly launch a multifaceted joint offensive? If not, then it is better to strike first, that is, without waiting for the other side to be ready, to defeat the relatively weaker members of the aggressive front first, at the very least to gradually weaken the strength of the other side's offensive. To put it concretely, instead of waiting for Japan to advance south, Germany and Italy to attack Greece, and the German army to strike directly at the British Isles, and then respond, why not take the initiative, seize one or two weaknesses of the other side, and severely punish them first. In fact, this kind of proactive strategy is not a very difficult or very dangerous task. In terms of the European situation, it is only necessary for the United States to immediately supply Britain with a large number of aircraft, so that Britain can seize air superiority in the Mediterranean, and then concentrate the naval, land, and air forces on both sides of the Mediterranean to strike hard at the Italian mainland and force it to surrender. In terms of the Far East, it is only necessary for the United States to quickly supply China with a large number of war materials and aircraft, so that China can immediately launch a general counteroffensive against Japan, and then jointly with Britain, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and the various territories of the British Empire, intensify the economic blockade against Japan; in this way, I am afraid that the Western Pacific can declare stability without waiting for Japan to launch its advance into the south. Although we do not want to rashly assert that the matter is easy, we dare to say that this is the only way to use relatively less cost to achieve the greatest results. We hope that all the countries concerned, especially the United States, will not hesitate any longer!

### Japanese Attempted Invasion of Baotou Foiled, Chinese Recapture Two Strongholds, Over 600 Japanese Soldiers Killed, Chinese Troops in Southern Henan Capture Strategic Location

Xingji: At the beginning of this month, Japanese forces gathered several thousand troops in Baotou. Starting from the 9th, they allied with over a thousand mercenaries and several tanks, dividing into multiple routes to cross the river and invade. The targets were Wang Aizhao (7 kilometers northwest of Xinminbao) and Shulinzhao (southeast of Dashuwan). Chinese forces met them head-on and engaged in fierce battles in areas around Lanji Yiliang (8 kilometers northwest of Xinminbao), Yangjia Yita (5 kilometers northwest of Xinminbao), and Xidashe (12 kilometers northwest of Xinminbao). The fighting was particularly intense at Hashila Chuankou. Chinese forces destroyed eight Japanese vehicles. Until nightfall, the Japanese forces, apart from a portion that harassed and attempted to pin down the Chinese forces southeast of Wang Aizhao, mostly retreated north under cover of poison gas. On the 10th, the Japanese forces received reinforcements and attacked again, but were repelled at Wang Aizhao Dongpu and Xidashe. At the same time, troops were dispatched to attack Japanese strongholds southwest of Baotou, such as Gong'an Nansha Pan Wayao Tan, posing a significant threat to the Japanese. On the front line, starting from 6:00 AM on the 13th, Wang Aizhao and Xinminbao were besieged, and troops were divided to encircle and attack the rear of the Japanese forces. The battle continued until noon, when the Japanese formation was thrown into chaos and retreated. They only put up slight resistance near Wufushe before fleeing north. By the 14th, the Chinese forces had eliminated the remaining Japanese troops and recovered Wang Aizhao and Xinminbao, and dispatched troops to intensify the pursuit.

China should now request that a portion of these planes be transported to the Chongqing government in China, and should quickly obtain military supplies from the United States before war breaks out in the Pacific, as transportation will be hindered after the outbreak of war. Lin further stated that there is no doubt that the United States is eager to aid China. China should decide the total number of supplies needed for a general counter-offensive as soon as possible and send that number to Washington quickly. Lin also said that Los Angeles has become a vast air force base, where aircraft testing and training are seen day and night. He is often awakened by the sound of planes at 3:00 AM.

Chongqing: According to the China Tea Company, China's annual tea production is 90,000 tons. Currently, apart from the portion for export, the company has monopolized the purchase and sale.

This will be of great benefit to the company's financial situation, not only making up for the loss of the tea price in the loan-for-tea scheme. Therefore, the company also plans to raise a large amount of funds to lend to tea farmers to increase production. The tea farmers will repay the debt with tea. According to relevant sources, the domestic control measures are not permanent. In the future, a free trade system will still be adopted to stimulate competition. (24th Havas dispatch)

Rumor German Troops Have Crossed Danube, Will Enter Bulgaria in Two Routes to Attack Greece

London: The Times reported that all signs indicate that this week may be a critical moment for Bulgaria. According to a dispatch from Sofia, although the German invasion has temporarily stopped, preparations are underway for another move this week. A dispatch from Sofia today said that German troops began crossing the Danube River on Friday of last week at several locations near Ruse and Svishtov. It is heard that the number of German troops is very large, but by Saturday of last week, the German invasion suddenly ceased, and even the pontoon bridges that had been erected were removed. The reason for the German side's sudden slowdown is currently unknown. According to Communist sources, the Germans are now waiting for Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to deliver a speech on diplomatic relations in Moscow on Tuesday. However, diplomatic figures in Sofia believe that the German side is now conducting a propaganda campaign to force Greece to submit before actually entering Bulgaria. In short, the German plan implies its hope to create a kind of "silent occupation" without formally announcing its arrival. Currently, the main roads to the south of Bulgaria have been marked with German road signs. Many "instructors" have also been found at railway stations. A large number of beans, potatoes, bread, and wine have been ordered for the main areas of southern Bulgaria for next week. By that time, the Germans must have crossed the Balkan Mountains. According to a source in Sofia, once Sofia is occupied, the German headquarters will decide how to deal with Greece and whether it is necessary to take action against Turkey and Yugoslavia. At the same time, the people of Sofia are now waiting for the arrival of the German army with uneasiness. (24th Reuters dispatch)

London: Today, the British headquarters here, based on recent reports from the Balkans, expects German troops to enter Bulgaria in two routes. The first route will cross northwest Bulgaria to occupy Sofia, and then advance along the Struma River to reach the Greek front line. The second route will pass through the Shipka Pass in the southeast and then divide into two parts, one part heading towards the Turkish front line and the other crossing the Rhodope Mountains to reach the Aegean coast. It is believed that the first route will occupy the Vidin region before passing through the Balkan Mountains to threaten Yugoslavia. (24th United Press dispatch)

London: The London Daily Express reported yesterday that German troops have occupied the four railway stations in Sofia and requisitioned hundreds of villas in preparation for the rapid arrival of a large number of German troops. (24th International News Service dispatch)

Ankara: News received here today stated that the German preparations for attacking Greece through Bulgaria are proceeding rapidly. It is reported that after the German troops cross the Danube River, they will reach Didymoteicho on the Greek border through the Struma and Mesta river basins. The area is 75 miles from Thessaloniki. The bridges in the western part of Bulgaria have been strengthened to carry 20 tons. People generally believe that the German army may use agile tanks. Others believe that the German army may send troops to Sliven southeast of Tarnovo so that they can be behind the main Bulgarian forces concentrated along the Turkish border. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Also, British forces occupied the town of Chinbole near the mouth of the Juba River in Italian Somaliland on Friday, seizing a large number of weapons and capturing many enemies. The war east of the Juba River continues to develop, favoring the British forces. A column of British forces is moving from the north towards the Red Sea coast and is supported by Free French forces coming from French Equatorial Africa. The column is progressing smoothly. British forces around Keren are also continuing to prepare to break through the Italian defenses protecting the town. There has been no change in the Libyan war situation. It has been revealed that the French forces that have arrived in Eritrea include about ten battalions of foreign troops, along with infantry, artillery, and tank units.

### The Soviet Union Continues Peaceful Policies with Military Force, Actively Strengthening Land, Sea, and Air Forces, Ready to Deal with Contingencies

Moscow - The Pravda newspaper, in its commentary commemorating the 23rd anniversary of the Red Army's founding, stated: "The Soviet Union, relying on the strength of the Red Army and Navy, continues its peaceful policies. The flames of the Second Imperialist War have spread everywhere, but the Soviet people are still able to continue their peaceful work. This is thanks to the policies of the Lenin-Stalin Party and the strength of the Red Army. Our task is to be ready to respond to any eventuality so that the enemy's schemes cannot succeed. For this reason, we must continue to strengthen the Red Army and Navy, and improve our military knowledge. The Red Army's slogan is 'Always Forward.' Socialist industry supplies the Red Army with machinery, including tanks and aircraft. Soviet engineers and workers can meet the needs of the military. The development of the Soviet national economy has been confirmed at the 18th All-Union Congress of the Communist Party, and further development plans are being implemented. This shows that the Soviet people are determined to supply their armed forces with modern weaponry to the fullest extent." (TASS dispatch, 24th)

Soviet Tank Numbers Increased 43 Times

Moscow - Regarding the 20th anniversary of the Red Army's founding, the Izvestia newspaper commented that, over the past 23 years, the Soviet government and the Communist Party have continued to dedicate themselves to strengthening the military's strength and improving its combat effectiveness. At the same time, they have done their utmost in terms of specialized machinery supplies. Currently, tens of millions of Soviet people are working hard to supply the Red Army and Navy with the latest equipment. In the past nine years, the Red Army's numbers have increased several times over, and its technical strength has increased from 3.07 to 13. According to precise statistics, from 1930 to 1940, the number of Soviet artillery pieces increased sevenfold, the number of tanks increased 43 times, and the number of aircraft increased six and a half times. (TASS dispatch, 24th)

Moscow - Admiral Isakov recently wrote in Pravda: "Over the past 23 years, the Soviet Union has actively strengthened its naval power. These efforts have now been successful. The Soviet Navy is developing simultaneously with the Red Army. The old ships inherited from Imperial Russia have been transformed by us into the latest destroyers, cruisers, and battleships. The "Aurora" and "Potemkin" were previously the only battleships in our navy, but they have been replaced by recently constructed high-speed battleships. In short, the Baltic, Black Sea, Pacific, Caspian, and Heilongjiang fleets have all been reorganized and strengthened." (TASS dispatch, 24th)

### Italian Prime Minister Delivers Speech at Fascist Party Meeting Acknowledging Difficulties in Fighting Britain, but Determined to Cooperate with Germany to the End

Rome - Mussolini delivered a speech yesterday at a Fascist Party meeting, telling the Italian and world peoples about the difficulties of Italy's war against the world power of Britain in the Mediterranean and distant battlefields, and expressing his confidence that Italy will achieve ultimate victory. The Italian Prime Minister's speech was broadcast everywhere. Loudspeakers were placed on all streets of Rome. When the speech concluded, cheers thundered and those listening applauded endlessly. Afterward, they sang the Fascist Party anthem. Mussolini began by saying that he came here to break the silence he had maintained, especially during wartime.

Italy at War

Not just since August, but for six years already, since January 3, 1935, it has been at war. When the Spanish Civil War broke out and Franco appealed for assistance, Italy could not turn a deaf ear. It was Italy's duty to rise and help. In fact, Italy has been at war since October 28, 1922, resisting the world of bureaucracy and the bourgeoisie. By September 1939, Italy was on the eve of war. History urged her on without allowing a moment to breathe. Therefore, Italy could not wait until the day it was fully prepared. Italy has thus hindered the enemy's large armies, preventing them from moving. In this way, it has assisted Germany in achieving its glorious victories. After France, there are still many enemies. Italy must fight them until its last drop of blood has been shed. What Italy is engaged in is ultimately a

Very Distant

difficult war. Libya is the most important military point. From October 1, 1937, to January 31, 1941, more than 14,000 officers and more than 356,000 soldiers were transported to Libya, forming the Fifth and Tenth Army Corps. More than 1,900 new-style cannons of various calibers, more than 15,500 machine guns, 11 million artillery shells, more than 100,000 rifle bullets, more than 24,000 tons of clothing, and 759 armored vehicles were transported. These numbers indicate Italy's careful preparation. The army fighting in the colony, without hope of reinforcement, is the furthest from Italy, and also what Italy cares about most. The Italians are not like the hypocritical British, and will not speak empty words, but will always tell the truth and refute any slander. The events of the past few months have only increased Italy's anger. Greece is Britain's

Last Bastion

in the Balkans. Greece is unwilling to abandon Britain's protection. Italy has no choice but to deal with it. On this point, Italy's responsible military circles are absolutely in agreement. The Italian army fighting in Albania is writing a glorious history of war. The Greek army has suffered extremely heavy losses. Spring is coming soon, and Italy's turning point will come with the spring. The British side has also suffered particularly heavy losses. The British claim of losing only 2,000 men is simply laughable. Since the Battle of Taranto, the war has indeed been unfavorable to the Italian side. However, Italy's ability to recover is extremely great. The victory or defeat of the war will be decided in the last battle. The Axis victory is absolutely certain. Britain can never win. In any case, Italy will continue with Germany to the end. The cooperation between German and Italian troops is based on a spirit of comradeship and friendship. Germany deeply knows that Italy is currently supporting 2 million troops and a

Large Air Force

and the heavy artillery force. The attitude of the German troops in Sicily and Libya is extremely complete, and worthy of being great soldiers. Germany's war strength has increased to date, and its losses in manpower and material resources are very small. Mussolini then elaborated on the following points: (1) Command is in Hitler's hands. (2) Germany's military equipment is far ahead of Britain's. (3) Almost all of Eastern Europe is anti-British. (4) The British blockade is now worthless, unlike the war from 1914 to 1918. (5) The morale of the Axis powers is stronger than that of the British side. The Axis powers are fighting for victory, while Britain is fighting for survival. Talk of a separate peace is simply absurd. Although Italian cities have been bombed, it is impossible to weaken Italian morale. (6) Britain is isolated and begging for help from the United States, but this kind of assistance must

Cross Germany's

power before it can arrive. (7) When Britain is defeated, the war will end. (8) Italy is now undertaking the main work, and its military equipment is increasing daily. This is due to the sacrifices of the workers. (9) Italy is proud to be competing with Britain, and a people with the courage to take risks are great. (10) Britain wants to defeat the Axis powers, but it must invade the mainland. This is something the British have never dreamed of. He also said that American intervention is based on the illusion of its being a democratic country, and the false claim that the Axis powers will attack the United States. In fact, the claim of invading the United States is extremely absurd and laughable. Finally, he said that the fascist Italian people should be victorious, and will ultimately be victorious, because their efforts and sacrifices are admirable. Victory and a just peace will surely belong to Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech to the Fascist Party Blackshirts yesterday afternoon at the Adriano Theater. Those present included party leaders and German Ambassador to Italy Dr. Mackensen. Mussolini's speech briefly stated that Germany and Italy are determined to move forward together on the road to victory. The Axis powers have formed a

Unified Front

to deal with one million British and Greek troops, the British fleet in the Mediterranean, and 15,000 aircraft. In addition to the air force that has already appeared in the Mediterranean, the German army has also landed in Sicily and Libya. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)

### Australian Prime Minister Broadcasts in Britain, Determined to Use All Manpower to Jointly Fight for Victory

London - Australian Prime Minister Menzies broadcast a speech to the British people last night. The gist of his speech was: "The British Empire must go all out. If there is any slackness, it will not be able to win." Menzies' speech briefly stated: "In terms of the production of extremely important war materials, the British Empire and the United States are only at the beginning. Germany must already be feeling exhausted. Even after the collapse of the Italian military effort, enslaving the workers of Italian factories will not help much. If we use time day and night, then time is truly our ally. The British people must not think that they are alone. I deeply believe that not only can I represent Australia, but I can also represent the entire British Empire overseas and tell the British people that we are all helping you in this sacred war. We guarantee that we will use all our manpower, resources, and skills to fight alongside you until victory is achieved. Then, in the world where our children live, there will be a more beautiful and just day. The Australian Expeditionary Force has become a large army with four divisions of elite troops. Tens of thousands of Australian troops have already dealt a heavy blow to Rome, and now they only hope to deal a blow to Berlin as well. Thousands of Australian youths, together with their brothers from Britain and the Dominions, are participating in the air war. They will surely see air supremacy in the hands of the British Empire. Most importantly, you and we are moved by the example of the King and Queen, and the spirit you hold is not only defensive in nature. It is not enough to merely avoid defeat. There is no compromise between the two forces of darkness and light. What we seek is not a half-light, half-dark world." (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

### Contents of Willkie-de Valera Talks

The content of the Willkie-de Valera talks, published yesterday by the Swedish capital's "London Sunday Express," has caused a great stir here. Official circles believe that it is necessary to make a clear statement. According to the report reprinted from the Dublin newspaper, Britain, with the help of Ireland, can conquer the submarine threat. There are four key points agreed upon: (1) The United States guarantees Ireland's neutrality, giving Ireland the same status as Panama. (2) Britain and the United States jointly manage Ireland's defense. (3) American ships may use Ireland's west coast. (4) Britain and the United States jointly manage the entrance and exit of the Irish Sea to protect shipping from enemy attacks. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)

### Germany Will Launch Naval War in March-April, Hitler's Broadcast Speech on National Socialist Party Founding Anniversary

London - Today is the 21st anniversary of the founding of the National Socialist Party. At 3:15 PM (11:15 PM Shanghai time), Hitler delivered a speech. His speech, as usual, first recounted the history of the Nazi movement, and severely criticized the Treaty of Versailles. Next, he expressed special admiration for the Nazi female party members. When mentioning his relationship with Mussolini, he said that he had chosen one person who would always share weal and woe, and help each other defeat the common enemy. Finally, he said that Germany will launch a naval war that the enemy will not expect in March and April, giving Britain a heavy blow. Hitler's speech lasted for an hour and a half, ending at 4:45 PM. The location was in Munich's famous beer hall. Only the National Socialist Party flag and the blood flag from the uprising were hung in the meeting place, with no other decorations. German cabinet ministers and National Socialist Party regional leaders were all present to listen. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

### Coolidge Arrives in Shanghai Today, Will Carry Evacuees Home Tomorrow Morning, Totaling Thousands, Many of Whom Are Renowned Figures, British Evacuation Is Actively Underway

The American President Steamship Company's giant ship, the Coolidge, one of the most luxurious liners in the Pacific, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong at 1:30 PM today, docking at buoys 11 and 12. Passengers will be ferried across the river by the smaller Moller launch, and are expected to land at the Bund New Customs Wharf at 2:30 PM. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 1:30 AM tomorrow (26th), passing through Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and San Francisco, bound for Los Angeles, California, in the United States. The last small launch for sending off passengers will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 10:00 AM. It is reported that the number of American evacuees leaving Shanghai on the ship will reach around a thousand. Only a very small number are attached to the ship to go to other ports. Among the famous passengers are former Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council Nash, former Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Hembly, the editor of the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury Mr. and Mrs. Gold, as well as the Vice Manager of American International Assurance Company Ries, and Mr. Yakin of the Spears Company, among dozens of others.

Quentin Returns to Shanghai from the Philippines

Quentin, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, took leave from the Council after being shot and injured by Japanese resident Hayashi Yūkichi on January 23, during the special meeting of foreign ratepayers this year. It is now known that Quentin's injury has healed and he is returning to Shanghai on the President Coolidge arriving today, and will soon resume his duties. Decisions will be made regarding the upcoming election of the Municipal Council's board of directors and financial matters.

Famous Photographer Blesses China

American Universal Film Company news photographer Kleynukoff (originally from Russia) has been taking news photos of wars and earthquakes in the Far East for 18 years. He is scheduled to travel to the United States on the President Coolidge this Wednesday. Kleynukoff has taken photos of the 1932 Shanghai Incident, the Taiwan earthquake, and the customs and conditions of remote places such as Mongolia, Korea, and Tibet. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War at the Marco Polo Bridge in 1937, Kleynukoff went to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hankou, all the way to the French Vietnamese border, going in and out of gunfire and bullets, taking films that were highly valued by Universal Company. He was then transferred to the United States to reward his hard work. After arriving in the United States, Kleynukoff plans to travel by car to major national parks. Kleynukoff recently told reporters: "I have so many friends in China, and I can't help but feel saddened to leave. China is my second mother country. Everything I have gained has been given to me by China and its people. I respectfully wish China a happy future and wish my friends happiness and prosperity." Kleynukoff plans to study color photography and recording techniques in the United States, and then return to China to take color and sound films of places where customs and conditions have not yet been captured on camera.

British Evacuation Actively Underway

The British evacuation is superficially subdued, but is actually proceeding very rapidly, because the environment of British residents today is not the same as that of American residents. It is understood that the British evacuation involves either taking American ships to America or Canada, or taking Shanghai ships to Hong Kong and transferring to Rangoon, Singapore, Australia, and India, and other safer areas. However, on the whole, although the British say they are evacuating, they are not returning to England. There are many British colonies and British residents in various places, and various industries are busy due to the war, so there is an urgent need for more British residents to go and serve. Therefore, in recent times, many British residents in this port have gone to Singapore and Malaya to join the army. In terms of ships, although they will not follow the American example of sending special ships to welcome the evacuees, the American Mail Line, the British India Steam Navigation Company, Jardine Matheson, and Butterfield & Swire, and other companies' merchant ships, can all be taken. British residents in the occupied areas have been coming to Shanghai one after another to concentrate and wait for ships to return home in batches.

### Easing Far East Situation, Reduction in Water Insurance Rates

The Shanghai Water Insurance Association notified all member insurance companies today, according to the United Press of America's Shanghai dispatch from the 24th, that the Ru Yi De General Office has reduced the insurance rate for goods from the Chinese coast to Manila, Singapore, and India by 50%, but only for ships that do not call at Hong Kong. The original water insurance rate was 2%, but it has now been reduced to 1%.

### No Possibility of Soviet-Japanese Trade Agreement Being Signed, Japan Gains Nothing, Scrap Iron and Cotton Cannot Be Obtained, Future of Thai-Vietnamese Dispute Mediation Is Bleak

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury said in yesterday's editorial that the loudest noise at the moment is none other than the fanfare in Tokyo, claiming that a commercial treaty will be signed with Soviet Russia. If viewed from what Japanese officials have been boasting, it seems as if once this agreement is signed, all of Japan's economic pain can be relieved immediately, and Japan's economy can break away from the United States and become independent and self-sufficient. The future is extremely bright. But when the facts are examined, there is a great error. We certainly know that in the near future, a Japanese-Russian commercial treaty may be officially signed, but its impact on the trade relations between the two countries will be very superficial.

Neither Country Has Large Quantities of Goods

The simplest reason is that neither country has large quantities of goods to export to meet the needs of the other party. If Japanese exporters think they can transport large quantities of cotton textiles and raw silk to Siberia, they will regret it. And if anyone thinks that the scrap iron or cotton that Japan needs can be transported from Russia to Japan, that is completely a dream. The role of the future agreement, apart from official propaganda, has no other value. In the future, the two countries can declare that trade has increased by several hundred percent in one leap, because the current amount of trade is so small as to be unspeakable.

What Is the Value of the New Agreement After All?

In the first six months of 1919, the goods amounted to 177,000 yen, the European part was 26,000 yen, the White Russians purchased 49,000 yen from Asian Russia, and 50,000 yen from European Russia, totaling 203,000 yen in Japanese exports to Russia and 99,000 yen in imports. During the same period, Japanese exports to various countries were 1,454,000,000 yen and imports were 1,108,500,000 yen. In other words, Japanese trade with Russia accounted for only 0.002% of total exports and 0.00009% of total imports. Therefore, people all over the world should be able to ask Japanese propagandists what the value of the new treaty is after all.

### Woodhead on Thai-Vietnamese Dispute

The famous commentator Woodhead published an article in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury yesterday, commenting on Japan's mediation of the Eurasian war, briefly stating that Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yōsuke's note to the British Foreign Secretary has caused unease in Berlin. After learning of this, the German side instructed the German ambassador to Japan to notify Matsuoka Yōsuke that this matter has been regarded by the British side as propaganda for Germany's weakness. Matsuoka deeply knows that his proposed mediation suggestion has caused condemnation from the German side and ridicule from Britain and the United States, so he has no choice but to make another statement, cleverly defending himself. Among Matsuoka's remarks, there are several sentences stating that Japan's dispatch of troops to Vietnam last year may even be the reason for the anger of Britain and the United States, only to claim that the purpose of the Japanese army's move was to obtain the "peaceful understanding" of the Vietnamese authorities. Little did they know that before obtaining the "peaceful understanding," the Japanese side had issued two final ultimatums, and after the "understanding" was obtained, they invaded Vietnam in the Lang Son area, attacking the troops stationed there. The reason for the "anger" of Britain and the United States is actually this and not that. In addition to mediating the European war, Japan is also participating in its so-called "mediation" of the Thai-Vietnamese war. Thailand is demanding land and engaging in aggression, all of which is instigated by Japan. Therefore, this "mediation" cannot be called impartial and selfless, which is really suspicious. And Japan's actions in the past few days have made it even more impossible for people to have no doubts. Japan's so-called "peace" proposal is for Vietnam to cede one-third of the Lao province and one-quarter of the Cambodian territory to Thailand. It is reported that this proposal has been rejected by the French side. At the same time, the Thai-Vietnamese peace conference held in Tokyo has also stalled due to the discovery of Japanese warships patrolling the Vietnamese coast. Japan's so-called "mediation" is aimed at exerting diplomatic and naval pressure on France to force it to cede land to Thailand. Japan's so-called "peace" proposal has become another "peaceful understanding," which is really unknowable. However, this kind of action is also inconsistent with what Matsuoka Yōsuke said, "Japan does not intend to take actions that make Britain and the United States feel uneasy about the Far East." If this kind of "mediation" can be called "mediation," then Matsuoka Yōsuke should not be surprised if the "anger" of Britain and the United States increases as a result.

### Men of Working Age Disappear in Hongkou, Absenteeism Increases Daily

Since the Japanese army forcibly dragged civilians in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas to serve as coolies, the entire city's residents have been terrified. Even the residents of that area have been staying at home, resulting in a sharp decline in the situation in more lively places such as Pingliang Road, Jingzhou Road, and Huade Road. Most shops and vendors are delaying opening and closing early, and even closing down automatically. Except for the elderly, the weak, women, children, Westerners, and Japanese, men of working age have almost disappeared on the streets. Japanese-owned public buses are suffering from extremely poor business. Most rickshaws only pull passengers to Zhabei and Fielun Road. Also, because workers from the electricity and telephone companies are also constantly being dragged away, the number of workers absent from work in various factories is increasing daily. The authorities of the two companies have already requested the concession authorities to negotiate with the Japanese side to stop the acts of forced labor, in order to maintain all public utilities. Also, some residents in the area who want to move south to avoid all obstacles have been refused permission to move, so the residents are complaining endlessly.

### Sudden Fire Accident at Jiangnan Shipyard

The Jiangnan Shipyard in Nanshi, formerly the Jiangnan Arsenal, after being occupied by the Japanese army, has canceled the part of the arsenal that manufactured guns and ammunition, and specializes in repairing warships and other shipbuilding matters.

### Fangdan Case Resumes Hearing Today

The case of four people suing the Shanghai Municipal Council for levying Fangdan land tax, the Consular Tribunal has scheduled to resume the seventh hearing at 2:30 PM today, still in the Council Chamber on the first floor of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Consular Tribunal Secretary Lang, Municipal Council Defense Lawyer Pollard, the four plaintiffs Ru Bao Yi, the original plaintiffs Fang Jia Ping, Hu Jing Fang, Zhu Pu Qing, Fang Wen De, and defense lawyers Liu Shi Fang and Wang Jian will all be present. After one more hearing, both sides will begin to argue.

### West Shanghai Gambling Den Rumored to Extend Closure Date, but No Knowledge on the Part of the Public Concession; Special Police Force Establishment Possibly Delayed Again

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that although the "authorities" have repeatedly assured the prohibition of gambling dens and dens of vice in the areas outside the West Shanghai Concession, news circulated among the Chinese this morning (24th) that the closing date of gambling dens, etc., has been extended to August, allowing those involved in gambling dens ample time to seek other employment. When reporters inquired about this with public concession police officials, they replied that they were unaware of any such change. The agreement signed on February 1st between the Municipal Council and the "City" remains unchanged. According to this agreement, the joint new police force to be established outside the concession roads will be responsible for closing all gambling dens and criminal activities. The new police force, originally expected to be established on January 1st, has been slightly delayed due to personnel selection and is expected to begin work in early March. It is believed that the establishment of the new police force will deliver a "fatal blow" to all illegal activities that have been operating in the badlands of the western district for the past three years. Previously, it was widely believed that the gambling dens in the western district would all move to the Nanshi (South City), but "City Police Chief" Lu Yingjin has now ordered a ban on gambling within the Chinese territory as well.

Several Issues Not Yet Agreed Upon

According to foreign sources, the "special police" for extraterritorial road construction may not be established on March 1st as originally planned. A spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department stated that it is highly likely that the establishment of the "special police" will be delayed, as "Special Police Director-General" Pan Zhijie and "Deputy Director" Klisha still have several issues that need to be discussed at length during their final negotiations and cannot be resolved hastily. He also stated that although there are rumors of establishment on March 1st, it has not yet been officially announced. Pan Zhijie and Klisha have been in discussions for ten days, discussing details such as uniforms and "branch office" locations. The spokesman continued that Pan Zhijie and Klisha's discussions are expected to conclude on March 1st. As for the issue of taxation for extraterritorial road construction, there are currently no new developments. Previous reports stated that the Chairman and Director-General of the Municipal Council had exchanged letters with Chen Gongbo, informally discussing the issue, but the two sides did not engage in concrete negotiations on the matter. The "special police" depend on this donation to maintain operations, therefore, negotiations on the micro-tax issue are a matter of utmost urgency.

### Brush Factory Workers Strike and Cause Disturbances; Authorities Dispatch Police to Suppress; Leather Goods and US Industries Labor Disputes Resolved Yesterday; Employees of Tailai Automobile Company Raise New Demands

The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that brush factory workers in this city demanded increased wages, which was rejected by the employers. Today (24th), they went on strike. Some workers broke into two brush factories on Elm Road and Quenhai Road, causing disturbances and slight material damage. Also, last night (23rd), workers at a certain leather goods store demanded a threefold increase in wages without success and rushed into the employer's premises. At the same time, workers at another leather goods store on Tianjin Road also went on strike. Their leader was arrested yesterday, and the workers entered the store and carried out sabotage. It is reported that the leather store owner has increased wages by onefold, but the workers are still not satisfied.

Tailai Employees' Conditions

Furthermore, over one hundred employees of the Tailai Automobile Company presented several demands to the employer today, stating that the employer had not fulfilled the recently agreed-upon agreement and requiring a response by Thursday. It is reported that their demands are: (1) an increase of 24 yuan in living allowance; (2) a 15% increase in wages for those earning less than 80 yuan per month; (3) a 10% increase in wages for those earning more than 80 yuan per month; (4) the employer shall allocate an additional 5% of employees' wages to employees' savings funds. According to representatives of Tailai Company employees, after the recent labor unrest in the four major taxi companies, the telephone operators of Yun Feixiang, Niushan, and Yinse companies have all received salary increases, but Tailai Company has not. Furthermore, according to news this morning, the owners of various leather goods companies in this city have finally decided to increase workers' wages by seven to onefold. Approximately two thousand workers have decided to resume work tomorrow (25th).

### Holding Firmly to the Outer Bastion of the Pacific: China Must Wage a Long-Term War (2)

— Song Ziwen

Our country's supreme commander initially knew that the concentrated firepower of mechanized units operating on China's vast land would have its own difficulties. Conversely, if Japan had short and good transportation lines to transport its heavy artillery, tanks, and aircraft, it could defeat the Chinese army, which had light weapons and no air force assistance, on any battlefield. When the battle in East China was fierce, our senior military officers all knew that our front lines might be forced to bend, but we were determined not to allow them to be broken through. We knew that the deeper the enemy penetrated, the weaker its offensive would become. Our Chief of Staff called this strategy "trading space for time."

But if China cannot be unified, the courage of the soldiers will be useless. Although our country's rich areas have fallen one after another, the coast has been blockaded, and Japanese planes have continuously bombed, our people are still willing to continue fighting. This is the permanent foundation of our country's strength. When our main force retreated westward, we were still able to adopt an extraordinary strategy of leaving entire armies or divisions behind Japanese lines, supplying themselves locally, to threaten the Japanese army's flanks and rear. To use American topography as an analogy, if an enemy army landed on the Atlantic coast, attacked Pennsylvania, and advanced on Ohio, the United States would still leave a large army in Pennsylvania, uniting with the local people to form a center for guerrilla activities. And if the enemy army even reached Indiana, then American troops would still remain in Ohio and Pennsylvania to threaten the enemy's garrison forces and continuously sabotage their transportation lines; therefore, the deeper the enemy army penetrates, the more the transportation lines in dangerous areas increase, the more soldiers are needed to maintain the transportation lines, and the weaker the strength of its advance forces becomes as they move further west.

If we look at a map of China today, there are so-called occupied areas. These areas are occupied only on the surface, in fact, they only occupy the cities, and a few miles away from the cities, they are still within the scope of the Chinese government's authority, collecting taxes as usual, circulating national currency, maintaining law and order, and trying cases. The Japanese may be able to occupy railway lines and important highway lines, but next to them are "guards" of Chinese regular troops or guerrillas, who constantly blow up bridges, tear up tracks, and attack Japanese troops. Now the westernmost reach of the Japanese army is Yichang, while several armies near Shanghai, Beiping, and Nanjing are still full of Chinese regular troops.

The Japanese now also know that their occupation of Chinese land is very superficial and unstable, and they also know that their army is deeply trapped and unable to advance. Four weeks ago, on December 27th, Mr. Stiller of the Chicago Daily News cabled from Shanghai, saying that the head of the Japanese army's press team also admitted that the hope of China's collapse was very slim. The cable said: "The Japanese army admits that it is encountering difficulties, which is indeed noteworthy news. Colonel Mabuchi, who has been stationed in Ping for more than a year, has recently returned to Tokyo." (To be continued)

### Lao Zha Patrolman Zhang Keqin Suddenly Attacked After Bathing; Two Thugs Break Into Bathhouse to Commit Crime; Bullet Penetrates Abdomen, Stray Bullet Grazes Back

At around 6:20 PM last night, at Chunquan Bathhouse, No. 40, Tongchunfang, No. 63, Zhejiang Road, Beihai Road intersection, Zhang Keqin, a patrolman from the Lao Zha patrol station, 36 years old, from Tianjin, had just finished bathing in the large pool and was reclining on couch No. 23 in the lower-level Republic Hall. After a while, a group of thugs suddenly arrived, guarding the entrance. Two others, both wearing woolen overcoats, barged into the room, looked around, and spotted Zhang reclining on the couch. Without asking any questions, they pulled out box cannons and fired two shots. One bullet hit his abdomen, penetrating his back. The other missed, piercing the pillow and passing through the outer room's wooden wall. At that moment, a back-scrubber named Xu Ansheng (42 years old, from Yangzhou) was having dinner when he was struck in the right thigh by the stray bullet, causing profuse bleeding. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the two thugs fled with their weapons. Although wounded by the bullet, Zhang did not show weakness. He bravely jumped up, raised a square stool, and struck at the two thugs, but missed. They managed to break out and escape. Afterwards, the bathhouse authorities reported the incident to the Lao Zha patrol station. Police officers were dispatched in vehicles to the scene, recovered the bullet casings for inspection, and promptly summoned an ambulance to rush the two wounded men to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Doctors performed surgery and discovered that the large intestine had been severed. His injuries were serious, and he was unable to speak, leading to concerns about his life. It is reported that Zhang was attacked because of his usual diligence and decisiveness in handling cases, having solved many kidnapping cases, resulting in him being at odds with bandits, leading to this assassination.

### President of Jinan University Escapes Kidnapping

Wu Xiu, Dean of Students at Jinan University on Kangding Road in western Shanghai, from Songjiang, over thirty years old, and formerly an executive committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, was walking along the intersection of Kangding Road and Xiaoshadu Road at around 4:10 PM yesterday when two kidnappers, accompanied by a Westerner, all unarmed, ambushed him. Seeing Wu walking nearby, they rushed forward, intending to force him into a car on the side of the road. The car's license plate number was 10350. Because Wu was quite strong, he saw that the thugs were unarmed and bravely resisted, eventually breaking free from their grasp and fleeing.

### Beheaded Indian Watchman Named Bajakasin Found on Route Sepanger, West Shanghai; Hospital Employee Suffered Multiple Axe Wounds, the Scene was Tragic

The "North China Daily News" reported that at 8:00 AM yesterday (23rd), several foreigners were riding horses on Route Sepanger in western Shanghai when they discovered the body of a beheaded Indian by the side of the road. An axe was found in a shallow ditch by the side of the road about one hundred yards from the Shanghai Sanitarium at No. 150 Route Sepanger. The Indian,

Named Bajakasin,

Had been a watchman in the staff quarters of the Shanghai Sanitarium for many years. When the body was discovered, the face was covered with a turban to hide the gruesome wounds. The body was wearing a green guard uniform. After inspection, it was found that the chest and arms had been axed. The murderer apparently used a sharp axe to unexpectedly kill Bajakasin while he was walking to work. Shortly after 8:00 AM, the Public Concession

Police Received a Report

And dispatched police to the scene. With the permission of the "City Police," the body was taken to the Public Concession because Bajakasin was a British Indian. The body was taken to the police morgue for examination. The examination revealed that Bajakasin had been dead for several hours, probably murdered while going to work at the sanitarium at midnight. At the time, the body was lying stiffly by the side of the road, and the color of his gray-green uniform blended in with the ground, making it difficult to distinguish. The front button of his coat was fastened tightly to cover the wounds on his body, but

Fresh Blood Gurgled

Out, and the area around the body was like a pool of blood. Bajakasin was 55 years old. It is reported that he had no personal enemies. It is likely that the murderer was lying in wait by the side of the road when Bajakasin happened to pass by and was killed. Police have taken many photos at the scene, but after further investigation, there are few results because the traces left by the murderer were washed away by the rain that night. It is noted that in recent years, this is the third time that the body of a beheaded Indian has been found in the western district. In the previous two cases,

A Murder Case Was Discovered

With political overtones. However, it is widely believed that the murder of Bajakasin this time has no political connection. Also, the English-language "North China Daily News" reported that Coroner Haines of the British Consular Court examined Bajakasin's body at Hongen Hospital this morning (24th), and Mr. Taal of the Shanghai Sanitarium confirmed that the body was Bajakasin, the watchman. Ding Zhongying, from Menghe, Changzhou, 54 years old, resides at No. 4, Jincheng Villa, Lane 1537, Jing'an Temple Road, Public Concession. His clinic is located downstairs, and he has a branch clinic at No. 7 Zhongheli, Fuzhou Road. He sees patients at the branch clinic from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM every day. At 10:10 AM yesterday, Ding, as usual, left his residence for the branch clinic. After getting into his own No. 2136 Peer car in front of his residence, the driver Yu Erliang (30 years old, from Pudong) drove slowly out of the lane. Unexpectedly,

Three Thugs Ambushed by the Side of the Road

Wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants, each carrying a pistol, rushed onto the car, threatening Yu to drive at full speed westwards. It was not until they reached Fahua near Daxi Road that they drove Yu out of the car. When the three bandits kidnapped Ding at the entrance of Jincheng Villa, Zhang Dongyou (47 years old), the guard of the lane, from Henan, happened to be at the entrance and was threatened by one of the bandits with a gun pressed against his chest, warning him not to make a sound. Afterwards, the bandit also

Jumped Into the Car

And left. Zhang witnessed everything and reported it to Ding's family afterwards. He also reported it to the patrol station. It is also learned that Ding has five sons. The eldest son, named Jihua, is 34 years old and is being treated at the office. The second son, Jimin, is 31 years old and serves at the clinic on Fourth Avenue. The remaining three sons, Jinan and others, either study inland or study abroad. At the time of the incident, one of Ding's maids was washing clothes on the drying platform and witnessed the old master

Being Taken Away by Bandits. She immediately reported the situation to her mistress and urgently telephoned the Jing'an Temple patrol station, which dispatched detectives to drive to the scene. However, the bandits' whereabouts had already been investigated. Not long after, the driver and assistant, Zhong Ruisheng, returned, and together with the lane guard, they were taken to the patrol station for questioning. As for Ding's car, it had not been found as of dusk at 6:00 PM. The patrol station is currently conducting a strict search.

Commercial News

### Food: Southern Seas Cannon Fire Silence for One Day, Rice Merchants Would rather Not Sell for One Day; Therefore, Yesterday Was Still a Situation of Holding Back, Brokers Unwilling to Take the Blame, Temporarily Suspending Listing

Since foreign rice was controlled by the four major rice merchants, it has become a situation of having transactions without a market, which has led to a dark rise in rice prices and unease in the market. These people are greedy, with the idea that if the sound of cannon fire in the South Seas does not stop for one day, they would rather not sell for one day. They simply want to hope for the rumored price of one hundred and dozens of yuan per picul of foreign rice on the market. Now it only sells for eighty-seven or eighty-eight yuan. Without the aid of cannon fire, it is still far from its target. Therefore, no matter how many millions of bags are stored or how many tens of thousands of bags arrive daily, it is not enough to shake their determination. However, the public is worried about the skyrocketing rice prices, the difficulty of purchasing, the worry of empty stomachs, the danger of starvation, and the anxiety about seeking a life to come. The hardest thing in the world is to get its balance. The source of life for millions of people, rice, is all controlled by a few wealthy rice merchants and hoarders. It is too painful. The Shanghai Brokers Association, in view of the past year's blame and injustice, and in this harsh environment, fearing that unscrupulous elements would impersonate brokers and engage in illegal transactions, has advised all brokers to automatically suspend sales for three days to clarify the situation and allow all sectors to understand the position and personality of the brokers. Therefore, the city's business is even more under the control of rice moths who disregard the people's food, forming a semi-paralyzed state. Except for the direct transaction of No. 1 Siamese rice by their line customers at 85 yuan, there is no formal market price for current rice. Even the returning futures are held firmly by the holders who are hoarding, and the total transaction volume for the day is only two or three hundred tons. Even the direct allocation of current rice to customers by firms is no more than a thousand bags. Unlimited price, the sensitive party opened 88 yuan, foreign yuan 89 yuan to 86 or 7 yuan has continued to add two yuan. A small number of Siamese No. 1 and milled waxy rice are just symbolic. New futures transactions without ships are not settled, which is a pretext for holders to raise prices. In fact, the situation is gradually easing. The insurance company notified yesterday afternoon that the insurance premium for Chinese seaports to Manila, Singapore, and the South Seas has been reduced by 50%, and the water insurance has been reduced to 1%. However, these rice merchants and hoarders who only know how to profit themselves and disregard the overall situation will again use the war between Thailand and Vietnam to raise the rice price again. Their intentions are sinister, and their schadenfreude is ten times more vicious than openly robbing with weapons. The guild's joint meetings are nothing more than occupying a few lines of newspaper news. How can they benefit the people's food? Just look at the current rice market to know that they are just perfunctory. As for the investigation of hoarders' rice reserves, it is also just a perfunctory matter. Once the heat passes, they will ignore it again. The rice market is so bad, it is precisely for the millions of Chinese people who eat rice that there is no way. The futures new transaction yesterday was not settled, and the return opened at 92 yuan for a small two-three month short squeeze, 91 and a half yuan for February, and 69 to 68.6 yuan for mixed broken rice, which are similar to the previous market. However, the owners only hope to profit and are still unwilling to sell.

The source of foreign rice is abundant, and it continues to arrive at the port day by day, as has been reported in this newspaper. The Zhagen Di ship of the Zhawa Company, which arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong last Saturday, also had more than 7,000 bags of foreign rice transported from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the Blue Chimney Wharf in Pudong. The Taikoo Company's Anshun ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (Sunday), carrying 3,100 bags from Hong Kong. The Suiyang ship arrived in Shanghai on the same day, also carrying 5,761 bags from Hong Kong. There were also 1,341 bags of corn (Zub).

National rice such as thick and thin japonica rice is arriving in increasing quantities, but the sales are also ordinary because the prices have repeatedly risen to extremely expensive levels. Therefore, the market yesterday presented a situation of neither glory nor disgrace. The opening price of Kunshan raw white japonica rice was still 110 yuan, with the price of Hu-jian at 105-6 yuan and a special price of 107 yuan. Qingjiao thin rice was priced at 102 yuan and 101.5 yuan for Hu-jian.

The market for glutinous rice is scarce, and the four major households are not restricted, so they have all started to absorb it, causing the price to continue to rise by more than two yuan. The opening price of Hong Kong special yuan was 88 yuan, and the medium yuan was 86 yuan.

### Flour Market Weak Then Stable—One Ship of Fixed Wheat is About to Arrive—

Flour: Yesterday's flour market was weak then stable. The opening in the morning was due to the gradual arrival of flour transferred from Hong Kong, and it is expected that foreign flour wheat en route can arrive in Shanghai on schedule at the end of the month. People's hearts have tended to be soft. The initial opening of Zhonglou brand Australian flour was 25.5 jiao, and the initial opening of Meili brand was 25.7 to 7.5 jiao, which were all slightly less than the previous weekend. However, the situation in the afternoon was slightly tight, because rice prices advanced, and Chinese factories selling flat-priced flour have not resumed supply. Actual sales on this street are quite good. The price of Huabird flour was firmly at 25.5 to 7.5 jiao. The transaction volume was more than 10,000 bags.

Wheat: Yesterday's market was firm and quiet as usual. The source in inland areas is still sparse, and a factory-fixed ship of foreign wheat has received a telegram en route, and it has been safely loaded. It can generally arrive at the port at the end of the month. Chinese factories are waiting for foreign wheat to be supplied, and they are not greedy for Dumai intake. Japanese factories attach importance to eating, and they are unwilling to let go of the price limit. Therefore, the fighting market is also without goods to collect. The market is unusually quiet.

### Financial and Gold Market Stimulation and Recovery: Fierce Surge Leads to 6,200 Yuan Mark; Spot Prices Even Higher, Exceeding Futures by 500 Yuan

Yesterday, the spot gold market experienced a fierce recovery after a period of sluggishness, surging directly to the 6,100 yuan and then the 6,200 yuan mark. It peaked at 6,240 yuan, marking the most vigorous rebound since the recent sharp decline. This was due to a certain bank's continuous absorption of a significant amount of spot gold in the market, coupled with the creation of momentum and the manipulation of sentiment. Uninformed individuals rushed to buy, pushing the price gradually from within 6,100 yuan to 6,140 yuan. Today, Tong Kang Yong Cheng Kee and silver houses were the most active in procuring gold, while Xin Yuan and others tended to sell. Retail investors also closed out their positions. The closing price was 6,225 yuan, 110 yuan higher than last Saturday's settlement price. For the switch from February to March, sellers offered 45 yuan, with limited transactions. Initially, hot gold was sold by熾人 to Xiang He for ten taels, at a price 470 yuan higher than the futures price. Heng Ji sold fifty taels to De Fu, 480 yuan higher. It also sold seven taels each to Xiang He and Dou Kang, 500 yuan higher. Fu Kang Yong offered ten taels to De Fu, 510 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Yong Cheng offered fifty taels to Xiang and Yong, still 510 yuan higher, peaking at 900 yuan, but there were no buyers. Jewelry gold rose by 20 yuan, reaching 690 yuan. Customs gold and other types remained stable.

### Full-Day Increase of 210 Yuan

The market opened with a wait-and-see attitude. A lack of buying interest led to an initial drop of 25 yuan, to 6,080 yuan. It briefly rose to 6,100 yuan, but Xin Yuan and others aggressively sold, causing it to decline again, eventually bottoming out at 6,070 yuan. Thanks to the joint purchases by Da Feng Yong, Tong Kang Yong, and bill merchants, the trend turned upward, pulling the price beyond the 6,100 yuan mark, peaking at 6,115 yuan. At this time, retail investors took advantage of the high price to sell, causing the price to weaken again, fluctuating back to within 6,100 yuan, and dropping to 6,088 yuan. By the afternoon close, the market stabilized slightly, ending at 6,095 yuan. The afternoon opening lacked momentum, starting at 6,085 yuan. Subsequently, reports of tightening foreign exchange rates led Gong Da, Tong Kang Yong Cheng Kee, and others to buy, pushing the price up to 6,195 yuan. Xin Feng Yong sold, halting the rise slightly, bringing it back to 6,165 yuan. Ultimately, the softening of foreign exchange rates and the buying frenzy initiated by silver houses such as Tian Yuan led to significant mutual purchases, pushing the price beyond the 6,200 yuan mark, reaching a peak of 6,240 yuan. The final closing price was 6,125 yuan, a net increase of 110 yuan compared to last Saturday's closing price. The full-day fluctuation was 140 yuan. The selling price of spot gold from cash houses was 500 yuan higher than the current month's futures price. Spot gold was more than ten yuan higher, and the closing price was twenty yuan lower. The current standard gold price was fifty to sixty yuan lower than the listed price, with few opening transactions.

Jewelry Gold at 690 Yuan

The asking price for silver jewelry gold was listed at 680 yuan per tael at 2:25 PM. It rose another ten yuan when quoted, ultimately reaching 690 yuan at Da Tong Hang. Xin Tong Hang's price was similar to the previous price, with a buy-back price of thirty yuan lower.

### Foreign Exchange Market Fluctuates: Easing Followed by Tightening

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the exchange rates listed by foreign exchange dealers. The black market for British and American currencies initially eased but ultimately tightened. First, rumors of a pull-back by a Japanese trading house, followed by speculative buying by Hong Kong telegraphic transfer merchants, led to a gradual softening. The transaction price for U.S. dollars for the current month fell from 5.65625 yuan to 5.59375 yuan. By the evening close, spot U.S. dollars had reached 5.5625 yuan, a decrease of 0.09375 yuan compared to last Saturday's closing price. The British pound's trend was slightly slower, with the spot closing price at 3 shillings and 4.4375 pence, a tightening of 0.015625.

Japanese Trading House Pulls Back

The morning started with stable exchange rates for British pounds, U.S. dollars, and Shanghai currency. There was no market for U.S. dollars against British pounds or Shanghai currency. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The opening selling price for spot currencies by banks was 3 shillings and 4.453125 pence for British pounds and 5.65625 yuan for U.S. dollars, the same as last weekend's closing prices. Futures were also stable. After the opening, foreign banks sold U.S. dollars, while British banks were still willing to buy, albeit slightly. The transaction price for spot U.S. dollars was 5.6875 yuan. At 9:30, the foreign exchange market's listed rates were unchanged. The silver equalization tax also remained unchanged. Speculators still had the intention to sell, offering March U.S. dollar contracts to brokers for 5.65625 yuan. By noon, trading became clearer, with the closing prices for spot U.S. dollars at 5.65625 yuan and British pounds at 3 shillings and 4.453125 pence.

Hong Kong Also Absorbs

The afternoon market initially remained firm, as speculators continued to sell U.S. dollars. The buying price for March U.S. dollars by a certain American bank was 5.65625 yuan. Subsequently, rumors circulated widely, with a Japanese trading house pulling back, selling current-month U.S. dollars to a foreign bank at 5.625 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers also bought, pushing the current-month U.S. dollar rate from 5.65 yuan to 5.59375 yuan. The evening was particularly brisk, with the final rates for spot and current-month U.S. dollars at 5.5625 yuan and British pounds at 3 shillings and 4.4375 pence. The next-month U.S. dollar rate was 5.5325 yuan, and the British pound rate was 3 shillings and 4.428125 pence. Compared to last Saturday's closing price, the British pound's futures and spot rates were slightly tighter by 0.015625, while the Shanghai currency rate was down by 0.09375.

### Securities and Domestic Debt Covering Short Positions — British and American Trading Houses Announce Dividends Together —

The black market for public bonds saw a slight recovery yesterday due to the covering of short positions. The market situation appeared firm. Due to numerous rumors in the environment, some were at a loss as to what to do. Market trading was still relatively active. Xin Fu came to buy again in the morning. Shun Chang favored only Ding-type bonds. Lian Yi, Run He, Yi Zhong, and No. 38 all saw purchases. Lian He, Xin Chang, Zeng Fu, Da Tong, and Yi Tai all sold. The noon close saw a recovery of 4.5 jiao to 9 jiao. In the afternoon, Xie Xing Yuan also had a willingness to buy. Xin Fu continued to buy. Lian He and De Long both covered short positions. Sellers were more active. Da Tong, Xie Kang, and Yong Kang initially sold and then bought. Hu He Kee, Yong Chang, Yi Chang, and No. 35 all sold. Market sentiment failed to rally. Ding and Wu types turned slightly weaker again. Selling was more prevalent after the close, down a small number of jiao. The final market prices saw a uniform recovery of 4.5 jiao to 9 jiao, with Ding-type and 96-type being slightly smaller by 5 fen. The total transaction volume was approximately 2.45 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:

British Steel Co., Ltd. has chosen March 24th as the date for convening the fifth annual shareholders' meeting. It is proposed to distribute a final dividend of 5 yuan per share of national currency for 1940.

### Yarn, Cotton, and Yarn Sales Without Major Development; Market Lingers; Coarse Velvet Cotton More Active

The yarn market is weak, and the overall situation remains one of fluctuation. The dull environment has scattered the intentions of bulls. Although there are still sporadic purchases that can be sustained, the difficulties in shipping make it difficult to develop and remain lacking in hope. Therefore, the market is hesitant to move forward. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,280 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,262 yuan. The afternoon price was 1,275 yuan. Subsequently, the rise in gold prices made sentiment more enthusiastic, rising to 1,308 yuan. The final price was 1,304 yuan.

The opening for Double Horse yarn was mediocre. The fluctuating situation in the Far East made people feel distracted. The opening price was 1,280 yuan. After this price was set, there were fewer buyers and more sellers. The market situation slowly declined to 1,165 yuan. Then, reports of calm foreign exchange rates and falling gold prices softened sentiment. However, with some covering of short positions, it rose again to 1,172 yuan. Due to the sluggish trading of spot yarn, it continued to loosen to 1,261 yuan. However, most bulls remained on the sidelines. At the close, it recovered to 1,272 yuan. According to statistics, the transaction volume for half a day was 5,545 bales. On the 25th, 130 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Siam, and 210 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts bought by each group are listed below:

The spot cotton situation is firmer, but the actual demand is still mediocre. However, coarse velvet cotton is more active. With the change in foreign exchange rates, people's minds have taken a step forward.

The New York cotton market was closed on Saturday due to an American holiday.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to purchases by European exporters and the hanging of short positions. It then became firmer due to questions about the price of pure gold. Yesterday, including forecasts, it rose by 2.5 rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade market situation is still tight. Sporadic transactions barely keep the market open. Although various parties' purchasing intentions are still not active, the raw cotton price is firm, and the recent import of foreign cotton is not crowded. The cotton market may have development hopes in the short term.

### Large Quantities of Finished Fabrics Shipped Out — Market Prices Only Obtain Small Gains —

The finished fabric market trend was stable yesterday. Street dyeing factories continue to absorb low-priced gray fabrics. Various fabric factories supply them in abundance. Yong An Factory opened sales of March Da Peng fine cloth at a price of 41 yuan per bolt, and ordinary 12-pound fine cloth at a price of 38 yuan to 39 yuan, opening 500 to 600 pieces in total. Sales showed a fluctuating state. White fine cloth twill fell by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao in the morning but recovered to its original level in the afternoon. Coarse cloth of heavy weight was flat. 9-pound cloth rose by 2.5 jiao per bolt. Some bleached and dyed fabrics rose by 5 jiao per bolt. Approximately 800 pieces of various fabrics were traded on this street. Zhejiang and Fujian businessmen bought more than 200 pieces of colored fabrics and bleached fabrics. Guangdong and Hong Kong businessmen bought more than 300 pieces of colored fabrics, colored twill, and crepe de chine.

East Cloth Market: Yesterday, the market rose and turned upward, and sales continued to rise. White Dragon Head fine cloth showed a mediocre trend due to the weak intentions of speculators, rising by 2.5 jiao per bolt, with a closing price of 45 yuan and 2.5 jiao. Mid-range fine cloths such as Rainbow Ball Flying Fish have become on par with the Dragon Head due to the surge in actual demand, continuing to rise by 7.5 jiao per bolt. The asking prices in the later market were all at 45 yuan and 1.2 jiao. Colored serge also rose to 1 yuan and 2.5 fen due to tight fundamentals.

Shipments: 50 pieces of finished fabrics will be shipped to Tianjin today (25th), another 100 pieces will be shipped to Yantai, 740 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 85 pieces will be shipped to Siam.

### Single-Sided Flannel Sells Well

Single-sided flannel is still popular at the moment. Most of it is cut and sold for Chinese robes and Western suits. Generally, brands are selling them in order to cater to customers' minds and easily sell the fabric. The best-selling products are Shanghai Textile's own factory goods, because their selling price is average and suits the tastes of buyers. Only Yong Xing and Hong Kang are specialized manufacturers in the Shanghai area. Yesterday, Yong Xing's No. 1 Yuan Cang camel single-sided flannel was sold in batches at 23 yuan per yard, and No. 2 was sold at 21 yuan. Hong Kang's was sold at 22 yuan. Those made in the United Kingdom were sold wholesale for 40 yuan.

### Speculation and Manipulation of Oil Cakes; Soybean Oil Continues to Rise by 1.5 Yuan

Yesterday, the soybean oil market continued to rise. Since the start of localized meandering progress last week, the overall trend has remained optimistic. The reasons do not escape manipulation and control. The market wind only sees rising, unlike the sudden rise and fall of soybean cake. Yesterday, 100 barrels of Dalian oil were traded at a price of 120 yuan to 119.5 yuan, rising by 1.5 yuan, and 150 barrels were ordered for the upper part of March at the same price as the current oil market, and 50 barrels were ordered for the lower part of March at a price of 110 yuan and 5 jiao. 300 barrels were delivered for the upper part of April at a price of 121.5 yuan to 120 yuan and 7.5 jiao, returning to 121 yuan and 2.5 jiao. Peanut oil stabilized. 50 pieces of Guangzhou oil were traded at a price of 106.5 yuan, 30 barrels of Qingdao oil were traded at a price of 147 yuan, and 300 cans of smoked tea canned oil were traded at a price of 140 yuan.

Also, 3,200 cans of sesame oil arrived from Yantai yesterday, and 2,300 cans of rice arrived from Qingdao. In addition, there were 12,000 bags of corn, which were shipped to Weihaiwei today.

### Sugar Market: Large Quantities of Dutch Sugar Arrive in Shanghai; Association's Charting Steps Loosen

A large batch of Dutch sugar has arrived in Shanghai. The Zhizha Yun Jia and Zhigen Di No. 2 ships of the Java Mail Ship Company arrived in Shanghai on Saturday afternoon. 4,100 tons of sugar, or 41,000 bags, were shipped from Java. Also, the Taikoo Company's Anshun ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (23rd), carrying 110 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, and the Suiyang ship arrived at the port on the same day, also carrying 200 bags of sugar from Hong Kong. (祖)

Yesterday, due to the increase in arrivals and the temporary lack of problems with the source, people's minds gradually softened and continued to decline. The association's chart, the current month's 24-type coarse white sugar, the outer warehouse initially at 80 yuan, then loosened to 79.8 jiao to 5 jiao, 1 yuan and 3 jiao smaller than the 22nd. The 10th day of March delivery was 80.8 jiao to 3 jiao, 5 jiao smaller. The 20th day of March delivery was 80.9 jiao to 6 jiao. Dutch red was 61.5 yuan to 61 yuan, 1 yuan smaller. Taikoo car white B mark West Warehouse was 80.5 yuan, later falling to 79.5 yuan, 1 yuan and 3 jiao smaller. East Warehouse was 79 yuan, DY mark West Warehouse was 78.5 yuan, and HX mark was 78 yuan, all 1 yuan smaller.

### Coal and Anthracite Coal Market Prices Rise Daily

The anthracite coal business is still quiet, and the selling price is firm and continues to move forward. The stock is becoming increasingly short, and the water feet are rising, and the combined price is rising daily. Traders are searching for goods, and dealers are hoarding goods. The market is rising step by step. The opening price for direct sales between coal merchants was 212 yuan for the opening freight train block and ton, 160 yuan for coal dust, and 205 yuan for Borneo anthracite. The warehouse delivery and barge water addition are charged separately.

### North-South Goods: Peach Meat and Walnuts Are All Available for Sale

Yesterday, 1,000 bags of first-class goods of Tianjin peach meat were opened, with a higher quality, at a price of 219. Also, 197 bags of Taizhou walnuts were opened at a price of 60 yuan, and the number was opened. However, there are still 500 outer bags, and the goods are inferior, but the rice is sold.

Agaric Sees Repeated New High Prices

Black fungus is in extremely short supply due to the lack of sources, so the spring market has repeatedly expanded without any signs of loosening. The recent increase is accelerating, and new high prices are repeatedly seen. It first opened at 725 yuan, and yesterday a small number jumped to 750 yuan.

### Economic Talks

— Feng Liutang

Clock Leakage (Continued)

Because it is a table clock, placed on a shelf, a naughty girl will grab at it, like Fang Guan in the 58th episode, who broke the clock.

"Xi Ren smiled and said, "I was humming a tune just now and didn't pay attention to how many times the clock struck." Qing Wen smiled and said, "This junk (referring to the clock) has to be repaired again." She picked up the clock and looked at it. She Yue smiled and said, "Speaking of naughtiness, Fang Guan should be spanked twice. Yesterday, she was playing with the 'jianzi' (pendulum) and broke it in half a day.""

The so-called 'jianzi' refers to the pendulum. At that time, although there were clocks, their timekeeping was not like the current method of stating a certain hour and minute, but still used the old method of stating a certain 'shi' (two-hour period), 'ke' (quarter of an hour), and 'fen' (minute). As in the 45th episode:

"Dai Yu said, "I want to rest. Please leave and come again tomorrow." Bao Yu heard this and turned to take out a gold watch the size of a walnut from his pocket and looked at it. The hands had already pointed to between Xu (7-9 pm) and Hai (9-11 pm)."

And as in the 19th episode:

"As Bao Yu and Xi Ren were talking, Qiu Wen walked in and said, "It's the third watch (around midnight), time to sleep. Just now, the Old Madam sent a mama to ask, and I answered that you had gone to sleep." Bao Yu ordered her to bring the watch to look at it, and sure enough, the needle had already pointed to Hai Zheng (10 pm)."

And as in the 63rd episode:

"The crowd asked what watch it was, and someone replied, "It's past the second watch (10-12 pm), the clock has struck past eleven." Mai Yu still didn't believe it and wanted to take the watch to look at it, and it was already Zi Chu Er Ke Shi Fen (11:30 pm)."

Some say that the numbers on the watch only go from one to twelve, but it has to record the time in 'ke' (quarters of an hour), which inevitably requires more conversion work when looking at the time. That is well said. But in the old days, although the clock parts were foreign goods, the face of the clock was made in China, and still listed the twelve 'shichen' (two-hour periods) of Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai on it, dividing it into twenty-four hours. When I was young, I still saw this kind of chain watch, so Bao Yu's watch could say Zi Chu Ke Shi Fen (11:30 pm) without thinking, how do you know that this watch did not also list the twelve 'shichen'!?

As for the shape of the chiming clock, as in the 92nd episode, the chiming clock that Feng Ziying was peddling to Jia Zheng was more than three feet tall, with a little boy inside holding a 'shichen' (two-hour period) sign, and whenever the time came, he would announce the time, and there were also some people inside playing 'shifan' (a type of music). Together with the 'Yinggong Chunxiao' (Spring Dawn in the Imperial Palace) screen, it was sold for five thousand taels of silver. Also, Wang Fengjie had a gold chiming clock, which she took to sell for five hundred and sixty taels of silver. This shows the value of clocks at that time.

### International Cup Football: Portugal vs. France Final; Donghua vs. Beixi Children's Team in Group A on Saturday Afternoon at Recreation Ground

The International Cup Football Tournament has a total of seven countries participating this year.

The final between the Portuguese team and the French team is scheduled for this Saturday (March 1st) at 2:30 PM at the Recreation Ground on Avenue Albert. Portugal has strong players such as Fa Fanhong, Kaositan, Victor, and Oliveira, making their strength exceptional.

### Small Ripples

— Editor

In this day when most people indiscriminately blame "science" for the evils of airplanes, bombs, and cannons, Professor Carlson's "Science is Not Guilty" theory is a cooling medicine that hits the mark.

The world is progressing, and will continue to progress, which is an irrefutable truth.

Human civilization is a torrent that is always rushing forward, and no reactionary force, no matter how large, can turn it backwards, because the trend of the main current of civilization is always forward.

Historically, there may be a period of time shrouded in darkness, but this is only a small ripple in the torrent and does not hinder the overall historical trend.

In this turbulent era, we should have this firm belief in progress.

Thoughts

### Science is Not Guilty

— Xu Mo

The more advanced human civilization becomes, the more people criticize and curse science. Is science really guilty? Recently, Professor Carlson of the University of Chicago expressed his opinion in defense of science in a speech. He believes that science itself has no shortcomings and no malicious intent to harm mankind, but the world has misunderstood it and misused it, thus creating all kinds of evils. Therefore, this is entirely mankind's own fault. Modern people enjoy the benefits that science gives us, and all they see are some industrial and new inventions of applied science, but they know nothing about the essence of science. We cannot all apply the principles of science to daily life. Even the greatest figures of modern times often hold traditional ideas, and their ability to apply scientific thinking is actually not much more advanced than that of "Peking Man" millions of years ago.

Professor Carlson believes that the failure of science can be analyzed into three main reasons:

First, modern education focuses too much on rote memorization. From early childhood in the family to university graduation, children are almost always reading dead books; they cannot learn the spirit of exploring the truth and experiencing reality. "You can teach a parrot to speak Latin, but a parrot that can speak Latin is still just a parrot!" Carlson believes that the modern education system is really too bad.

Second, modern scientists are becoming more and more specialized, and the more specialized, the narrower they become. As a result, they almost always get stuck in a rut, but when they step outside their own circle, they are just as full of impetuous emotions and narrow-minded prejudices as ordinary people who do not know what science is. Scientists lacking good cultivation can easily become the culprits of mankind without realizing it.

Third, human nature inherently has a stubborn force that resists new ideas and new lifestyles. For thousands of years, religion has used all kinds of inducements or threats to get people to walk the path of goodness, and it is still not easy to make them obey. The young science of history is naturally even more difficult to achieve satisfactory results.

Although the situation is like this, we don't need to be discouraged or pessimistic. Professor Carlson concluded:

"We must admit that mankind has always been gradually progressing for millions of years. Their understanding is becoming richer, fear and hatred are gradually being eliminated, and they are becoming better, more decent, and more respectful of justice and humanity than before. Gradually but inevitably, the scientific method will make our lives more rational and happier; pain and tears will leave this world. Perhaps at some time or in some place, violent acts and madly invasive wars will hinder the pursuit of scientific truth, thus causing it to sink and be forgotten, but I believe it will be rediscovered in a more advanced time, with more excellent human beings."

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(4) Unexpected Encounter

"...We knew long ago that this fellow named Ma was too poor, we told you not to bring him, but you didn't listen and brought him here. Look at him on stage for so long, has he ever received a single cheer?" A strange, shrill voice was shouting upstairs. As Yu Kun reached the mezzanine landing of the stairs, he knew it was Shen Mazi speaking.

"We originally wanted to send a telegram to Shanghai to bring Liu Yuhua here, but he was asking for too much money..." The voice was very low and vague, full of heavy phlegm, and one could tell it was Zhao Si, the head of the Begonia troupe.

"Can't Boss Wu take less money himself?" Shen Mazi said very impolitely.

Begonia's room, number six, was almost at the top of the landing, and Yu Kun, swaying on the stairs, pushed open the door and barged in.

"What's all the fuss about?" He deliberately half-opened his drunken eyes and asked, pretending to be puzzled.

Shen Mazi was in the midst of his anger when he suddenly saw this disheveled man, half-resembling a beggar, barge in and speak in such a presumptuous manner. He couldn't help but feel greatly displeased. Although he saw that his behavior was also that of an opera performer, he thought he was just an unimportant extra and glanced at him briefly without greeting him, and continued to speak to Begonia and Zhao Si.

"Speaking of Boss Wu, you're not being very friendly either!" Shen Mazi leaned half his butt on a square table, rolled up his sleeves, and tightened the fat on his face, looking like a debt collector. "Nine out of ten times, the shows we schedule are cancelled by you. You're more serious about what shows to sing and what shows not to sing than our mothers! How can we not lose money like this?"

Having performed opera for several years, Begonia had become much more timid. In the past, when he was in the opera school, he would still playfully throw tantrums, but now that he had his own troupe, he only had to bow and greet people, and he dared not offend anyone. At this moment, facing this reckless Shen Mazi, he naturally had no way to deal with him!

"Boss Shen, there's also a layer of difficulty here." Zhao Si, who was short and fat, was somewhat bolder. "Not to mention plays like 'Pan Si Dong', Boss Wu can't sing them no matter what; even other joke plays are because of a certain Master Yuan..." (Three Nine)

Family

### A Happy Life

— Liang Ying

"Is it bitter?"

"No, this life is happy." My wife smiled firmly.

It has been three years since we drifted to this isolated island.

Fortunately, not long after arriving in Shanghai, I found a job in a cultural institution, and my wife also became a teacher in a primary school. So, we tried our best to forget our destroyed home in a distant place, and built our home again in a corner of the isolated island.

Prices are climbing every day, and the magic clutches of the economy are tightly gripping us; for three years, we have been fighting for a living with our meager salaries. However, our life is quite happy.

In the morning, my wife carries a water bucket to the community boiler. Breakfast is soaked rice with oiled peanuts, or pancake fritters and soy milk. After filling our stomachs, we leave home to work.

As a rule, my wife returns home half an hour earlier than I do. When I habitually step into the alley of our apartment, my cold heart warms up. I gently knock a few times on the glass window along the alley, and my wife jumps out to greet me like a little bird, showing a childlike smile, and taking the things from my hands. Then this small kitchen, which costs twenty yuan a month, becomes busy. My wife skillfully cooks and prepares meals, and I help my wife fetch water and add coal balls to the stove. An hour later, we have dinner together very comfortably and happily. In the evening, we go for a walk outside. In the dazzling night light, we plunge into the white-hot crowd, appreciating the night scenery of the city; after a while, we walk on several quiet street corners, and in the cool night breeze, there is my wife's silver bell-like laughter. Sometimes, under the dim light, I write a manuscript; when our eyes meet occasionally, we exchange a silent blessing. And every Wednesday, we go to attend a symposium at a friend's place.

Four years ago, which was the spring of the year we got married, we also had a very lively home; but this home was destroyed in the fire of war. Will we forget this blood lesson? Occasionally, when I talk with my wife about the situation in the previous year, I can't help but have a sense of emotion; however, we are not sad, and we don't even recall the beautiful dreams of the past. My wife often says: "If the war hadn't destroyed our home, we wouldn't have understood so many things. Like our motherland, the past three years have not been wasted. We have come into contact with people from all walks of life, tasted things we had never thought of before, and learned more life skills. Like our motherland, although the present is a little difficult, we are facing the light." And aren't we very happy now?

Sometimes, we really want to go to the interior, but we can't raise this travel expense. However, although Shanghai has become an isolated island, it is at least a part of our country, and many things remain for us to do on the isolated island. As long as we stick to our posts, work hard, and do not fail our country, and do not fail our conscience!

### Nourishment for the Soul

— Shen Fu

In our life, there are always some successful things, and these successes are mostly obtained from the encouragement of others.

Encouragement is nourishment for the soul. If there is no encouragement, you can't expect a worker to have a good job. Without encouragement, no one will live with interest.

Keep it in mind: after you encourage someone, how happy you feel! So, don't miss the opportunity to give encouragement to others. —George Matthew Adams

Entertainment World

### Chaplin and Wife Watch "The Great Dictator"

— Qi Ping

For two years, this genius comedian has been focusing on making his new film, and now it is finished. When "The Great Dictator" had its premiere at the Astor Theater in New York, Chaplin arrived, and he was more eager to know the success of the film than any audience member!

Chaplin, with his dazzlingly high status and unique acting skills, is sure to stir up society with every work he releases. When his "Modern Times" premiered in New York, the police authorities were very busy. Broadway was packed, and vehicles and pedestrians were blocked. In Times Square, a large group of workers were emotionally tense and unruly. Hundreds of police officers went to stop them, which shows how enthusiastic the situation was in general.

The premiere night of "The Great Dictator" was no less grand than in the past. Chaplin and his beloved wife, Paulette Goddard, arrived gracefully, and many people even broke through the police line to catch a glimpse of their demeanor. "The Great Dictator" was shown simultaneously in the Astor and Cattol theaters. That night, going to see this film became a necessary part of the entertainment program for New York's highest social circles. Almost all the seats in the two theaters were occupied by lucky children and their fathers who worked on Wall Street, as well as noble ladies. It was truly a scene of towering crowns, swallowtails, and gorgeous costumes shining against each other. Chaplin and the actor who played another dictator, Jack Oakie, came to see the film. Charles Laughton and his wife, Elsa Lanchester, who were visiting New York, also participated. They were surrounded by photographers when they entered the theater.

The unanimous opinion given by film critics to "The Great Dictator" was "Rather than saying it is another success of Chaplin, it is more appropriate to say it is his greatest work." The New York Times praised it as "A realistic, beautiful and good work produced by a realistic great artist." They believed that Chaplin had already expressed his resentment against mass production and making workers slaves to machines in "Modern Times" four years ago. Now, in "The Great Dictator", he expresses his utmost ridicule and scorn for the dictatorship system, and shows unlimited sympathy for the people. The value of his work cannot be estimated simply by "providing people with laughter."

"The Great Dictator" is about to be released in London. It is rumored in New York that Chaplin will receive 70% of the box office revenue. In London, ticket prices will also be raised, just like when "Gone With the Wind" was released; but Chaplin denied this, stating that his income would not exceed 50%, so the price increase is also unfounded. He hopes that this film can extend its run in London and agrees that hundreds of theaters can show it simultaneously. He believes that this film contains profound meaning and is a very good propaganda item. The British audience can not only appreciate it, but also benefit from it.

The Confusing and Tumultuous Rumors of a Breakup

After the marriage of Paulette Goddard and Charlie Chaplin went from secret to public, there are now rumors of a rift between the two. The fact is that when the famous British writer H.G. Wells came to the United States in January, Chaplin held a banquet at his home to entertain him, and Paulette Goddard was also pouring wine on the side. But a few days after Wells left, Paulette moved to the seaside villa, while Chaplin moved to Florida. That's all there is to the rift. (Huang Xinde)

### Tan Jigu Society Opera School

— Li Yunying

Before the war, the only opera school in China that used its name was Fu Liancheng Opera School. Unexpectedly, opera schools would develop so much after the incident. Shang Xiaoyun started a Rongchun Society. Li Wanchun then started a Mingchun Society. These two opera schools have already occupied a considerable position in Peiping. Then Tianjin had the birth of the Jigu Society. The co-founders of the school are four. Now there are only Gao Xingqiao (the owner of an amusement park) and a certain prince of the late Qing Dynasty left. In addition, Gao's eldest son, Bohai, an amateur, was hired to be in charge. However, plays such as "Yijiu Gai" (One Wine Beggar), "Bai Taiguan", and "Cui Meng" are also often staged, and the audience is actually quite good. This is really due to the teachers coming from Fu Liancheng. But sometimes they also stage Journey to the West-style seaside scenery plays, which is very disappointing. Speaking of this, we should review the teachers in their society. Now let me briefly describe them:

Shang Heyu was always suppressed under Xiaolou in the nineteenth level of hell, and never became very popular. In Peiping, he was just teaching and singing, so the Jigu Society hired him to Tianjin as a professor. There is also Li Jiri (who unfortunately passed away shortly after joining the society). The society only used them to attract audiences. Isn't it really all contracted by Lü Tingyu (Shang's second-in-command)? As for Cheng Yonglong and Li Lanting, who are the highest paid in the society, they only taught two episodes of the Twelve Iron Roosters and eight or nine episodes of Sanmen Street. Liu Xiyi has also taught in Fu Society for many years. He is a hero (that is, the backbone of the opera troupe). "Night Run" and "Shenzhou Lei" are still good; "Changbanpo" and "Shizipo" are not good. Although Han Fuxin's skills are good, his repertoire is not wide. He can only teach "Wu Wenhua", "Zhao Jialou", "Yanyanglou", etc. However, it is always slightly better than the broad but unrefined Lü Tingyu. Wang Yunqing (i.e., Wang Duofen), who teaches female roles, is not as skilled as Ru Xiang. Yan Xilin, who teaches male roles, is still good, but he has not been in the society for a long time, and his position is not high. The rest include Zhou Lianfang (teaching female roles), Zheng Shaoheng (teaching male roles), Tang Lianshi (teaching old female roles), Liu Zhenlin (teaching clown roles), and Ma Shaoshan (teaching young male roles), whose skills are mediocre and not worth mentioning. If the society does not hire famous teachers, it will be difficult to achieve results in the long run.

### Strike in Hollywood: Garbo is Old and Not Worth Much

— Hu Fanfang

Miss Ann Sheridan at Warner Bros. has a weekly salary of $750 (of course, US dollars), but she thinks it is unsatisfactory and has recently refused to make films. It is heard that Miss Sheridan's request is $1,500 per week. Warner Bros. has already indicated that they will "grant her request," but during the "strike," a film starring Miss Sheridan could not be delayed for long and has been taken over by Rita Hayworth.

Alice Faye has also expressed a similar "strike." "Tin Pan Alley" was originally her film, but because she said she wouldn't do it, Betty Grable was temporarily invited. Who knew that Betty became popular after acting. Alice Faye, seeing that her position was unstable, hurriedly backed down, so she co-starred with Betty in "Hello, Frisco, Hello," but the two's hatred became deeper and deeper. They even didn't speak to each other when they met. Seeing this, Fox selected two new scripts and had the two star in them separately. Alice Faye's new films are Rcad To Rio The Great American Broadeast, but whose "trend" is sufficient can only be determined by the facts.

Although Greta Garbo has not yet become old and worthless, the "fee" for each of her films has been greatly reduced. MGM recently offered her $150,000 to make a new film. Garbo has already promised. If it were three years ago, it would not have been done for less than $300,000. It is heard that the male lead of the new film is William Powell, and the title of the film is undecided.

After Tyrone Power starred in "The Mark of Zorro," he was highly praised by the audience. Fox has invited him to star in the famous Spanish literary work "Blood and Sand." In the silent film era, this film was starred in by Valentino.

### Brief News

On January 27th, Shanghai Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, through Mingyuan Radio Station (frequency 960), broadcast a special Shanghai opera program for the Six Great Tonics grand prize prediction, and in order to treat customers favorably, telephone purchases on that day, no matter how much, will have practical and valuable gifts, in order to show gratitude.

### News from Shadow City

— Hui Lin

Hollywood film reporters held an informal actor election at the end of last year, and the results were as follows: James Cagney was chosen as the most talented male actor in Hollywood, and Bette Davis was chosen as the most talented and best-performing actress; in addition, Paul Muni and Katharine Hepburn were also highly praised. Katharine Hepburn has been away from the silver screen for a long time, and this is her comeback year.

One of the ten epic films set in Africa, "King Solomon's Mines," contains many African native dialects, one of which is called "Swahili," a language widely spoken in Africa. 20th Century Fox officials have claimed that, besides English and Chinese, Swahili is the next most prevalent language in the world.

John Barrymore is currently performing on stage in Chicago. It is said that he fainted due to excessive fatigue. His friends rushed him to the hospital, and after some procedures, he was immediately discharged. If John insists on performing on stage twice a day, his health will be even more affected. He recently divorced his wife, and now he is struggling with his performances, truly a case of misfortune never comes singly.

Recently, many Hollywood stars have been causing trouble while driving. For example, Errol Flynn and his wife, Lili Damita, were riding in a car when Errol lost control and crashed the front of the car into a brick wall. Doctors initially thought his injuries were severe, but later found only slight injuries to his face and arms. At the same time, not long ago, Lee J. Cobb also came out of the hospital, also due to a driving incident. However, these things are not surprising, because three years ago, Wallace Beery was injured while piloting an airplane.

### Game 261: Scolding the Locust by Pointing at the Mulberry Tree, Proposed by Zhu Zhaoming

The method for the pawn of the 260th game is listed below (Red moves first to draw). If the black side does not respond correctly to this game, then Red is bound to win.

Rook 2 advances 5, Rook 8 retreats 6, Rook 1 moves horizontally to 2, Advisor 5 retreats 6, Rook 2 retreats 8,

Pawn 6 advances 1, Rook 2 moves horizontally to 4, Pawn 5 moves horizontally to 6, General 4 advances 1, Pawn 7 advances 1,

Minister 3 retreats 1, Advisor 6 advances 5, Minister 5 retreats 7, Elephant 1 retreats 5, Soldier 7 advances 1,

Advisor 5 retreats 4, Minister 7 advances 9, Advisor 4 advances 5, General 4 moves horizontally to 5, Advisor 5 retreats 4,

Soldier 7 advances 1, General 5 moves horizontally to 6, Soldier 7 moves horizontally to 6, General 6 advances 1, Soldier 6 advances 1,

Pawn 7 advances 1, Minister 1 advances 2, Elephant 5 advances 7, Soldier 6 moves horizontally to 5, Elephant 7 retreats 9,

Soldier 5 moves horizontally to 4, Elephant 9 advances 7, General 5 moves horizontally to 4, Advisor 4 advances 5, General 4 moves horizontally to 5,

Advisor 5 retreats 4 (Draw). According to this game, if at the 26th move, Pawn 7 advances 1 and instead the Advisor 4 advances 5, then the Red Soldier 6 moves horizontally to 5, the General 6 moves horizontally to 5 to remove the pawn, then the Soldier 6 advances 1 to capture the Elephant, and Red wins.

In Game 258, "The Horse Steps on the Replanted Seedlings," the move of Red 8-7 should be changed to the 7-6 path, and the method remains the same.
