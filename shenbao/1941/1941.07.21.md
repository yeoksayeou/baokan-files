### Soviet Parliament Issues Order: Stalin Appointed Minister of Defense, Mass Mobilization of Land and Air Forces to Prepare for Counteroffensive, Defend Moscow and Baku Oil Region

TASS, Moscow, 20th - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union announced the appointment of Stalin, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, as Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union. Marshal Timoshenko, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Front, was appointed Deputy Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union.

International News Agency, Moscow, 20th - Stalin has personally taken command of the Red Army starting today, succeeding Marshal Timoshenko as Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union. Timoshenko will serve as Deputy Minister and is currently commanding the Central Soviet Army to defend Moscow. This adjustment has made Stalin the Supreme Commander of the Red Army. The order was issued by the Supreme Soviet Presidium and signed by Chairman Kalinin.

United Press, London, 20th - Yesterday, sources here reported that the Soviet Union had recently concentrated a large number of air force and mechanized units in the Moscow area to prepare for a counteroffensive. Both German and Soviet sources have not indicated that the German forces have successfully completely severed the northern and southern flanks of the Red Army. Confused reports state that, so far, the Germans have only made a large salient in the Polotsk and Nevel areas in the central sector. In the first four weeks of the war, the German army advanced 365 miles from Poland, averaging 23 miles per day. However, this momentum has decreased to eight miles per day after reaching the Soviet defense lines.

Havas Agency, Stamford, 19th - A traveler from the Soviet Union claimed to have seen several divisions of the Red Army heading west from Moscow. Artillery and anti-aircraft artillery units were defending Moscow, with as many as twelve lines of defense. Traveling within the Soviet Union is currently quite difficult, he said.

Havas Agency, Stockholm, 20th - German forces are launching flanking attacks on the northern and southern sides of Smolensk in an attempt to encircle the Red Army. The Red Army is still resisting as much as possible to delay the advance, in order to continue mobilizing troops. It is reported that three million troops are being concentrated east of Moscow, and new defensive fortifications are being built along the Volga River. Preparations for defense in the Ural Mountains area have also begun.

Havas Agency, Stamford, 20th - According to diplomatic circles here, the Soviet Union has concentrated one million troops in Rostov (near the Caucasus region in southern Soviet Union and the Sea of Azov) to defend the area and prevent German forces from threatening the Baku oil region.

Four Major Areas: Fierce Battles Between Soviet and German Armies

United Press, Moscow, 20th - According to official communiqués, the Soviet Red Army and Hitler's forces have been engaged in fierce battles in four major areas of the Western Front from last night until this morning, fighting relentlessly throughout the night. The areas where these two major continental armies are clashing are: (1) the Pskov region on the Baltic Sea; (2) the Polotsk to Nevel area in Belarus; (3) Smolensk; (4) the Velikiye Luki area. Among these, the battle in the Smolensk region, the gateway to Moscow, is the fiercest. German mechanized units are fiercely attacking the stubbornly resisting Soviet defenders in an attempt to directly assault Moscow. There are no major developments on other fronts. The German army is apparently reinforcing heavily. Nevel, a railway center 45 miles northeast of Polotsk on the central front, is where the Germans are apparently trying to break through the salient point of the Soviet defenses in the north in order to advance rapidly. On the northern front of Moscow, the German army is still trying to defeat the Soviet defenders in Pskov and Porkhov in order to reach Leningrad directly. The Soviet Air Force also assisted in the battle at night, fiercely bombing the enemy's armored units on the front lines and the enemy troops moving east from the rear.

International News Agency, Moscow, 20th - It was announced here today that the Soviet army is successively dispatching large numbers of aircraft to the front lines to cover the land forces, fighting hard to slow down or stop the German army that is attacking Moscow fiercely from Smolensk. The Red Army High Command stated that German tank convoys, mechanized units, aircraft, and airfields have suffered significant damage. The damage is particularly severe along the Smolensk-Moscow railway line. The communiqué issued yesterday afternoon did not state whether the Soviet army was still holding its ground to resist the German offensive, but TASS stated that Red Army cavalry and Cossack troops had launched fierce counterattacks against the advancing German forces, rushing into the enemy's ranks and engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The Soviet side had previously stated that Soviet aircraft destroyed two troop transport ships and five oil tankers at the mouth of the Danube River. The Soviet communiqué also stated that fierce battles had been going on for three days and three nights south of Leningrad and Moscow.

Reuters, London, 20th - Both Soviet and German communiqués state that there are fierce battles on all fronts, but neither offers any definite reports. The Soviet communiqué still states that there are fierce battles at locations 160 miles southwest of Leningrad, Smolensk, over 200 miles west of Moscow, and about 120 miles west of Kyiv. There is still no confirmation from other sources regarding the German claim of occupying Volynsk.

United Press, Berlin, 20th - German military circles stated yesterday that the entire front line of the Red Army has gradually disintegrated and German armored units are advancing towards Moscow along the highways, gradually posing a direct threat to the city. German armored units are reportedly less than 200 miles from Klin. According to German official sources, the German army is advancing towards Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv in three routes. At the same time, the German army is constantly forming pockets of encirclement against the Soviet army in the area between the Stalin Line and Moscow.

International News Agency, Berlin, 20th - The German High Command announced last night that after fiercely fighting and occupying Smolensk since Wednesday, the city is now a raging inferno. The Nazi offensive, aimed at the heart of the Soviet Union, is now advancing along the highway towards Moscow, reportedly only 200 miles away. Berlin sources say that the decisive battle is imminent. The communiqué stated that Major General Makarov, commander of the 11th Mechanized Corps of the Soviet Army, was captured. At the same time, when German troops stormed the headquarters of a Soviet division near Kyiv, they captured several Soviet staff officers.

German Troops Pass Through Sweden, Soviet Planes Bomb Finland

Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 20th - According to sources here last night, the passage of a German division through Sweden has been completed. The Swedish authorities have ordered all railways to be freely available to the German army. No accidents occurred during the transit of the German troops, it is said.

Havas Agency, Stockholm, 20th - Finnish troops north of Suoyarvi (on the north shore of Lake Ladoga) are still advancing towards the Lepola area in the northern part of the Soviet Karelia region, with the railway connecting Leningrad to the port of Murmansk as their ultimate goal. They have already pushed the Red Army back to a point ten kilometers east of Lepola. Finnish troops in the Karelian Isthmus are advancing towards Koivisto, located at the northern end of the Karelian Isthmus defense line, a key point for defending Leningrad. The Red Army has built two lines of defense in this area, indicating its importance. The Finnish military command has approximately seventeen divisions, of which fourteen are concentrated in the Karelian Isthmus in preparation for an attack on Leningrad, two are in the Salla area, and one is a reserve force. In the northernmost Murmansk area, the attack is being undertaken by German forces, and the Red Army's strength there is reportedly thirteen divisions.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th - According to sources here last night, German troops occupied a railway station south of Leningrad on Friday.

Havas Agency, somewhere on the German border, 19th - Military observers here state that Berlin is abuzz with rumors that the vanguard of the German army has reached the outskirts of Leningrad. At the same time, the official announcement speaks of staggering victories, either annihilating large numbers of Red Army troops or claiming that Leningrad or Moscow will fall imminently.

Reuters, Helsinki, 20th - On Friday and Saturday, many areas in eastern Finland were bombed by Soviet planes. According to the Finnish side, four Soviet planes were shot down.

Leningrad Fortress Has Strong Defenses

United Press, Helsinki, 20th - Sources here state that the target of one of the three main German forces attacking the Soviet Union is Leningrad. This fortress is said to be one of the largest fortresses in the world. Since 1937, Leningrad and the surrounding area have been a fortified region, similar to the Leningrad Military District. This fortified area covers 30,000 square kilometers and has a population of five million. The northern boundary of this region is the Gulf of Ladoga, the southern boundary is the city of Pskov, the western boundary is Lake Peipus and the Narva River, and the eastern boundary is Kholm and the Volkhov River. After the Soviet Union and Estonia signed a mutual assistance treaty in 1937, this region included non-essential Estonian strongholds. By the spring of 1940, it was further expanded to include new fortresses on Hango and areas in the Gulf of Finland. The garrison in Leningrad is said to number 600,000, divided into four corps, and has 3,000 aircraft. The Soviet fleet is also said to be part of the defense of this fortress, and the workers of Leningrad have formed a reserve army. The construction of this fortress has taken more than ten years, and the defenses are very strong. It has new airfields capable of housing 2,000 aircraft. In 1937, the fortress became a completely militarized zone. All foreign consulates were ordered to close, and foreigners were ordered to move out. All residents not needed for national defense were also selected to leave. Therefore, for several years, the Leningrad fortress has not leaked any information to the outside world, and the specific defensive fortifications cannot be seen by outsiders because most of them are built under buildings.

### German Cargo Ships Sunk by Soviet Forces

TASS, Moscow, 20th - The Soviet Information Bureau released a battle report stating that in the Baltic Sea, our patrols discovered a large convoy of enemy cargo ships with heavy escorts. As a result of a joint attack by our air force, torpedo boats, and destroyers, eleven enemy cargo ships were sunk and one aircraft was shot down. Our army lost one aircraft and one mine-laying boat. There were no injuries to the crew.

### Moscow Bombed?

Havas Agency, New York, 20th - According to reports this morning, Moscow was heavily bombed by German planes yesterday. Sources close to the Soviet Union have denied this, saying that Moscow issued an air raid alert once yesterday, and the alert was lifted within a few minutes. No enemy aircraft appeared in the sky.

United Press, Stockholm, 20th - Unconfirmed reports in the local newspapers state that Leningrad Radio reported that the Kremlin had been destroyed after an air raid by German planes.

### Hitler and Mussolini to Meet Again in Brennero

Reuters, London, 20th - Moscow Radio broadcast last night that Hitler and Mussolini will meet in the Brennero Pass in a few days. It is said that this information came from reliable sources in a Central European country. The topics to be discussed will likely be: (1) the situation on the Eastern Front; (2) the replacement of German occupying forces with Italian troops in certain areas; (3) the prospects for the war against England; (4) the status of France. It is rumored that Hitler may allow Italian troops to occupy the French provinces of Corsica and Savoy.

### Rumors of Soviet Government Moving to Kazan

Havas Agency, Berlin, 20th - Local radio stations report that the Soviet government has moved to the city of Kazan (on the east bank of the Volga River, east of Moscow). However, the Communist Party's Politburo and the Department of Protocol of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs remain in Moscow. Stalin and Molotov are also in Moscow.

International News Agency, Washington, 20th - The State Department announced that while some staff members of the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union have been evacuated to Kazan, the ambassador and most of the diplomatic staff have no plans to leave Moscow.

Editorial

### The Soviet-German War and the World After One Month

The war between the Soviet Union and Germany will be exactly one month old tomorrow morning. To compete for this most important page in modern history, both sides have mobilized unprecedented military forces to engage in an all-out effort. As of now, although battle reports from both sides are contradictory and the situation on the front lines is extremely complex and confusing, it is undeniable that the German army has made some progress at a heavy price, posing a serious threat to the three important cities of Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv. After breaking through the Soviet defenses between Vitebsk and Mstislavl, the German army has penetrated deep and occupied Smolensk, threatening the Soviet capital. The Soviet side is making every effort to block the advance on one hand and attacking the German army's rear on the other, and both sides are continuing to wage fierce battles. However, even with Smolensk, the German army's most advanced point, being only 200 miles from the Soviet mainland border, the German army's achievement in this bloody battle is far superior to that of the Japanese army in the Shanghai-Songhu War, but far inferior to that of the previous summer on the Western Front, where it forced the Netherlands, Belgium, and France to collapse and surrender one after another in more than forty days. Moreover, in some areas, the positions of the two armies are intertwined, and the German army has not yet completely forced the Soviet army back within the old Soviet borders. Since the Nazis failed to encircle and annihilate the main Soviet forces in one fell swoop as they did in France last year, this strategy of penetrating alone is undoubtedly an excessive risk. After separately appointing the main generals for the three major war zones on the Western Front, Stalin also took on the role of Minister of Defense, combining party, government, and military power into one. With greater concentration of authority, command should be more convenient, and it is expected that he will be able to demonstrate great resistance and resilience in the great battle to defend Moscow. The Nazis not only failed to defeat the Soviet Union within six weeks, but as time goes on, the difficulties will inevitably increase and the progress will slow down. If this drags on, their future fate is very unpredictable.

The Soviet-German war is naturally the focus of the current world situation and the center of attention for people around the world. However, the future of this war must be a long-term war of attrition. Regardless of whether the situation in Moscow is by no means as hopeless as the fall of Paris last summer, even if the important cities in the western Soviet Union unfortunately fall, it will not be a decisive victory for the Nazis. As early as a few years ago, the Soviet Union had moved the center of its national defense and heavy industry to the east of the Ural Mountains. Under constant arduous management, it has been fully prepared to cope with a long-term war of resistance. Judging from the current war situation, the German army is disregarding the taboo of attacking fortified positions and advancing single-mindedly in the central sector. In the Kyiv sector of Ukraine, there has been no significant progress, and the oil depots will not fall into the hands of the Nazis intact. If Hitler's sudden attack on the Soviet Union was for the urgent need to replenish resources, it can be concluded that even if his attack on the Soviet Union succeeds by chance, his wishes will be difficult to fulfill. In the process of this war dragging on, the sacrifices and consumption of the Nazis will be extremely great. On the other hand, it will give the democratic countries more opportunities to prepare and strengthen themselves. It is believed that the combat power of Britain will soon reach a balance with that of the Nazis, and the counteroffensive that the world is waiting for may materialize.

Although the evolution of the international situation has been slightly slow in this month, the trend is worth being optimistic about. First, the Anglo-Soviet alliance was established. In addition to mutual assistance, they also mutually guaranteed not to make peace with the Nazis midway. This is probably the most unexpected thing for Hitler, and it was realized because the aggression and recklessness of the aggressors have no end. In recent days, the Soviet Union has also changed its previous cold and indifferent attitude towards countries other than Britain and the United States that are jointly resisting the Nazis, and has successively established diplomatic relations with them. Even with Poland, which has territorial disputes with the Soviet Union, it has once again emphasized the necessity of adjusting Soviet-Polish relations under British mediation. Second, the situation in the Atlantic has improved unprecedentedly. The number of British ships lost in the past month is almost the smallest since the start of the war, and the British ships have spare capacity to attack Axis ships. After the United States occupied Iceland, the supply of war materials to Britain has also been significantly guaranteed. Even if this is only a temporary phenomenon, its contribution to strengthening British strength is by no means small. Third, the British army took this opportunity to eliminate the remnants in East Africa and counterattack Bardia, consolidating the periphery of the Middle East. In particular, the successful conclusion of the Syrian war not only eliminated the fear of Turkey's defection, but also had significant implications for the joint British and Soviet protection of the Caucasus and the Persian Gulf. Fourth, the Japanese cabinet was reorganized due to diplomatic failures. The successor is indeed a military fascist cabinet preparing for war, but it is clearly more cautious towards the Axis alliance, which has aroused disappointment from the German side. On the side of the democratic countries, although outwardly extremely calm about the Far East, they are inwardly on high alert. The close cooperation of the A, B, C, D line has formed a strict precaution against aggressive attempts. Now, British and American public opinion is no longer as optimistic about the new Japanese cabinet as it was at first. Most people recognize its inherent serious implications. The British advocacy of identification marks for ships, the American preparations for blacklisting, Halifax's warning remarks, and the emergency meetings convened by the U.S. authorities are all precisely aimed at the brewing crisis in the Far East that is waiting for an opportunity to move.

In summary, it can be seen that no matter how the Soviet-German war changes, the trend of the international situation is always developing towards a brighter direction. Since the aggressors ignited the flames of war ten years ago, they have encountered the strong resistance of the international coalition forces for the first time today. The evolution in this month, even if it has not been fully satisfactory—such as the slowness of the United Front's progress and the persistence of inaccurate understanding of the Far Eastern crisis—on the whole, it has already laid a victorious foundation for the victorious future of the anti-aggression war.

### National-Communist Friction Can Be Eliminated: Central Government Urges Communist Party to Comprehend, Jointly Resist Foreign Aggression Without Intention of Suppression; Zhou Enlai Appeals in Writing for Unity

Chongqing - Reuters has learned from authoritative sources that the Chinese government has no intention of suppressing the Communist army. The reason for announcing the Communist army's provocative actions is based on the following reasons: (1) Since the New Fourth Army Incident, the Communist army has repeatedly attacked the Central Army on various front lines in the past few months, while the Central Army has been ordered not to take retaliatory actions. (2) Hoping that the Chinese Communist Party will cooperate with the government, as the communists in England and the United States naturally do, but the Chinese Communist Party is not doing this. Instead, they are strengthening their insidious activities. The Chinese government sent a special letter to Zhu De, hoping that the Communist Party would stop its hostile actions. This announcement will make this fact known to the world, so that the world and the situation can change the attitude of the Chinese Communist Party. (Reuters, 2nd)

Official Restraint to Prevent Escalation of Disputes

Chongqing - The friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has been clearly and publicly exposed here today. The official side also released information describing the clashes between the Eighteenth Group Army and the Central Army. At the same time, a formal spokesperson for the Communist Party expressed doubts about the clash and called for unity in the war against Japan. Government officials also took appropriate steps to prevent the friction from developing further here and requested all newspapers not to publish comments on the matter, so that the government would have more opportunities to resolve the dispute. The only newspaper that failed to comply with the request not to comment was the Catholic Yishi Bao, which strongly condemned the alleged clash. The official information issued by the Military Affairs Commission was published by all newspapers except the Communist New China Daily. The official information stated that on June 25, the Eighteenth Group Army led by Zhang Aiping (transliteration) went to a certain county government, killed one section chief, kidnapped more than 70 members of the county police guard, and seized 234 rifles and 4 machine guns. The next day, the Eighteenth Group Army troops stationed in Donghuzhuang (transliteration), Baoxian (transliteration), Shandong Province, attacked the Chongqing guerrillas fighting the Japanese army in southwestern Shandong Province, killing dozens of guerrillas.

Mr. Zhou Enlai Urges Unity

Zhou Enlai, the chief representative of the Communist Party in Chongqing, published an article expressing doubts about whether there were indeed such clashes and calling for unity. The article began by saying, "I can clarify that according to the orders to participate in the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, the Eighteenth Group Army once attacked the Japanese army in the southeastern defense zone of Shanxi Province, but immediately retreated to its originally designated area after completing its task. The defense zones in Leling, Guiping (transliteration), and Huimin counties of Shandong Province were assigned to the Eighteenth Group Army by the central government. How can clashes occur with other Chinese army units? In fact, did any clashes occur? The Military Affairs Commission received the telegram on July 18 and published it on July 19. Not only did Zhu De not have time to reply, but I also did not receive any notification beforehand. This is the factual process. What we want is unity, not division, and all-out war, not internal strife."

Communist Party Does Not Believe Such Incidents Occurred

Here - The Communist Party office stated that it receives reports from the headquarters of the Eighteenth Group Army every day, but it has not received any reports regarding the clashes mentioned in the information. The office also stated that the so-called dare-to-die troops that attacked the Central Army somewhere are not subordinates of the Eighteenth Group Army, but troops of General Ye Xishan (transliteration). The two places in Shandong Province where the alleged attacks occurred have not had any Eighteenth Group Army stationed in the past two years. Both places are far to the north of the Yellow River. At the same time, the Communist Party here does not express surprise at this news and says that they believe there will not be serious consequences.

Another Report Speaks Confidently

At the same time, well-informed military sources revealed that the Eighteenth Group Army has been actively expanding in North China, so that the Central Army in many places in Hebei and Shandong provinces has been completely excluded by the Communist Party. It is said that the area north of the line from Xinyuan (transliteration) to Lishi in Shanxi Province and the uncaptured areas in western and eastern Shanxi are all controlled by the Communist Party. This area was designated by the government for the Eighteenth Group Army. In other words, in the province, except for the important railway areas and several cities in the hands of the Japanese army, the rest of the region is occupied by the Communist Party. The Communist Party now has two border areas as bases for additional activities, namely the northern part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area and the Hebei-Chahar-Shaanxi border area. There are also eight permanent activity bases, namely in northern Suiyuan, southeastern Shaanxi, northwestern Shaanxi, central Hebei, eastern Hebei, western Shandong, eastern Shandong, and northern Jiangsu. One source pointed out that the Communist Party's plan is 10% to fight the Japanese, 20% to fight the Kuomintang, and 70% to expand itself. Military sources say that this plan has resulted in a large area and caused incidents. (United Press, 20th)

### Lattimore Praises China's Astonishing Progress, Exalts President Chiang's Noble Character, Completing the National Salvation Undertaking Amidst Hardship, America Has a Deeper Understanding of China

Chongqing - Political Advisor to Chairman Chiang, Owen Lattimore, arrived in Chongqing yesterday. Reporters visited Mr. Lattimore that evening, and he made the following remarks: "It is a great honor for me to serve under the great leader of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Looking at history, we can see that there are very few great leaders in the world, and among these few leaders, Chairman Chiang is not a stagnant figure. Chairman Chiang has been able to lead the nation in fighting against foreign aggression for many years, while at the same time making astonishing progress domestically. This is enough to prove the greatness of his character and the brilliance of his talent." When asked about his plans for China's resistance and reconstruction, and whether he had any special mission in coming to China this time, Lattimore replied, "My first task is to seek instructions from Chairman Chiang, and then accept the Chairman's instructions and take on the designated task." Regarding recent malicious rumors spread by certain parties, claiming that Lattimore's arrival would force China to end the war first, and that the United States had an urgent intention, Lattimore's words can be said to indirectly refute these rumors. When mentioning Chairman Chiang, he often referred to him as "my leader." Lattimore did not discuss China's administrative and political issues, saying, "I have been away from China for four years. As far as I know, in the past four years, all aspects of China's domestic affairs have made astonishing progress, and all sectors of the country have become more united. Regarding external rumors about China's internal political problems, Lattimore expressed a deep understanding, saying, "Although it is difficult to predict how China should solve its own problems, in fact, China's various problems are being handled under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and there has already been great progress." When Lattimore talked about the attitude of the United States towards China, he was very excited. He said, "After China's heroic fighting for four years, the attitude of the United States towards China has changed from theoretical sympathy to a greater and deeper understanding. I recall when I returned to the United States from China at the beginning of the war, and I talked with Americans about the Sino-Japanese War, I strongly stated that China could never be conquered by other countries, but most Americans did not dare to believe this, thinking that my firm opinion was based on emotional considerations. But today, if anyone who doubted China four years ago were told that China would eventually collapse, they would certainly dismiss it as absurd. The majority of the American people deeply believe that after fighting under the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang, China has completed the great task of national salvation, China has become a stabilizing force in the Far East, and will eventually become an example for the entire Asia." When asked whether sympathy for China was due to the efforts of the Central Propaganda Department, Lattimore said, "Although this has played a minor role, the real reason is due to China's own achievements in resistance and reconstruction." Lattimore speaks Chinese and Mongolian fluently, but he is still modest and willing to spend several months practicing after arriving in Chongqing. (20th Dispatch)

Chongqing - According to reliable sources from Reuters, Chairman Chiang's private political advisor, Owen Lattimore, is expected to meet with Chiang Kai-shek this afternoon. Although Lattimore has lived in China for many years, this will be their first meeting. It is said that Lattimore plans to meet with other Chinese and American leaders after meeting with Chairman Chiang. (20th Reuters Dispatch)

### Soviet Foreign Vice Minister Declares Restoration of Diplomatic Relations with All Anti-Aggression Governments, Including Yugoslavia, Norway, Poland, Greece, Soviet-Czech Agreement Guarantees Mutual Aid Against Germany

Moscow, 20th (Reuters) - Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Deputy Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Lozovsky, stated last night that the Soviet Union, in the great war against Hitler, is prepared to restore diplomatic relations with all countries with which it had normal relations in the past. It has now resumed relations with the Czech government. The Soviet Union is willing to restore relations with all other governments that are currently resisting aggressor nations. He also stated that the Soviet people's resistance to aggression, the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet political and military agreement, and the United States' determination to aid Britain to the end have spread a tide of new hope throughout the occupied countries, and all doubts and pessimism have been eliminated.

Soviet Border, 19th (Havas) - It has been confirmed that the Soviet government intends to restore diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia, Norway, Poland, Greece, and other countries. The former Yugoslav ambassador to the Soviet Union, Gavrilovic, has returned to Moscow. Diplomatic representatives from other countries will also return to the Soviet Union to take up their posts.

### British Aircraft Bomb Enemy Convoy Off French Coast, Ten Ships Heavily Damaged or Lost, Dunkirk Shipyards Also Bombed, Cities of Aachen and Münster in Germany Completely Destroyed

London, 20th (Reuters) - An Air Ministry communiqué stated that British air forces attacked an enemy convoy off the French coast yesterday, inflicting heavy damage on enemy coastal vessels. Eight ships in the convoy, totaling approximately 48,000 tons, were heavily damaged or lost. Yesterday afternoon, another convoy of seven ships was attacked by British aircraft near the Isle of Wight. A 10,000-ton oil tanker was hit by several bombs, causing a large fire. Another ship of approximately 4,000 tons was also hit by four bombs and caught fire. All British aircraft returned safely. Last night, British aircraft continued to bomb western Germany, concentrating on the Hanover industrial area, causing a large fire that could be seen for miles. An enemy fighter took off and intercepted a British bomber, but was shot down. Two British bombers are missing.

London, 20th (Reuters) - An official British communiqué stated that on Saturday and Sunday afternoon, British heavy bombers, under the cover of fighter planes, bombed the Dunkirk shipyards. Four enemy fighters were shot down by British fighter planes. Three British bombers and two fighter planes are missing from these days.

Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - Yesterday, British aircraft attempted to bomb the French and Belgian straits, but were repelled by German aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. One British bomber and four fighter planes were shot down. There were no German losses. Off the coast of Holland, German naval guns repelled a British aircraft squadron and shot down two of them.

London, 20th (Reuters) - The British Air Ministry's intelligence office stated that at least one-third of the German cities of Aachen and Münster have been destroyed by British air forces. The number of casualties must be high, and the damage cannot be repaired for several months. Aachen was attacked on July 10, and many bombs were dropped. A total of 7,000 incendiary bombs fell on the city, and the damage to the city center was particularly severe. Subsequent reconnaissance confirmed the terrible extent of the damage. Münster, which the German broadcast referred to as an "unfortunate city," suffered the same fate. The city was attacked five times, and the entire city was destroyed. Industrial and residential areas were reduced to rubble. Two heavy bombs fell, one destroying an area of 7,000 square yards, and the other destroying an area of 6,000 square yards. Other areas were also severely damaged. Göring's statement that not a single bomb could fall on German territory has long been shattered. The British Prime Minister's statement that Britain would retaliate in kind, so that the Germans would also suffer the pain of war, is now being implemented.

Cairo, 20th (Reuters) - A Middle East communiqué stated that a British bomber squadron attacked an enemy cruiser and several destroyers in the port of Palermo on Thursday night. Bombs fell near the enemy ships, but the results are unknown. On Friday, British fighter planes engaged two enemy planes over Cyprus and shot down one of them.

### Thailand and Vietnam Establish Monetary Agreement, Thailand to Begin Occupying Ceded Territories Starting July 24

Saigon, 20th (Reuters) - Officials stated that the Thai and Vietnamese delegations attending the monetary conference have reached an agreement on financial matters. The exchange rate for currency in the territories ceded by Vietnam to Thailand under the treaty is also within this agreement. Both chief representatives stated that the discussions were conducted in a very friendly atmosphere, and both sides were very satisfied with the outcome of the discussions. Thailand will begin occupying the ceded territories on July 24, and will complete it by August 1. In the two major areas of the Lao province, Thailand has equal rights to all of Laos and most of the teak forests. The teak forests were developed under French patents, which expired in 1940 and were not renewed. The Thai side believes that the ceded territories are sparsely populated and can be developed. Thailand will pay Vietnam 6 million Thai baht over six years as compensation for taking over all Vietnamese government assets there. Thailand also recognizes the existing property rights of the people.

### Issue of Women and Children Leaving Djibouti Under Discussion Between Britain and France

Cairo, 20th (Reuters) - British authorities in Cairo have not yet received a reply regarding the request for women and children to leave Djibouti (capital of French Somaliland). Britain's only concern regarding the port is the use of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway, as using this route can avoid motor transport vehicles crossing the mountainous areas of British Somaliland to Abyssinia, and these transport vehicles can be used elsewhere. The Djibouti authorities are apparently following Vichy's instructions, still hoping that Abyssinia will be a war zone, even though 90% of the goods transported into Abyssinia via the Red Sea are for civilian needs.

Vichy, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - Well-informed sources state that Britain and France are exchanging views on the issue of the disposition of French women and children in French Somaliland. The talks were initiated by a neutral country.

### Bumper Harvest of Food Crops Expected in Various Parts of Free China, Civilian Life Will Be Slightly More Stable, Prices of Goods Expected to Fall

Chongqing - According to reliable sources in the interior, the food shortage in Free China has now passed. Although the harvest in each province may not be called a bumper harvest, it is believed that a 70% harvest can be guaranteed. There is only one month left until harvest, not only will the population of Free China have sufficient food next year, but there is also hope that rice prices will fall, making civilian life less difficult and slightly more stable. In the past two months, pork prices have fallen significantly. It is said that because food was scarce and expensive, farmers in the countryside felt that raising pigs was unprofitable, and they all sold them at low prices in the market. In the future, prices are likely to rise. At the same time, prices in Free China have gradually stabilized.

### Foreign Minister Guo Recognizes New Japanese Cabinet as a Semi-Military Organization Preparing to Seize Possible Interests from Britain and the United States, and Warns the United States Not to Appease Them Again

Chongqing, 20th, United Press - Chinese Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi warned last night that the composition of the Japanese cabinet is intended to obtain the last possible benefits from Britain and the United States before making a final blow towards its ultimate goals in the Far East. Foreign Minister Guo told a United Press reporter that he noticed that there were many figures from the Japanese Navy and Army in the Japanese cabinet. Chinese experts on Japanese affairs believe that the Third Konoe Cabinet is a temporary semi-military organization to fully prepare for Japan's planned military actions. Chinese experts believe that when Japan is fully prepared and ready to launch an attack, the cabinet will give way to a true military government led by the military. Foreign Minister Guo also said that the characteristic of the new Japanese cabinet is that it is essentially a military cabinet on the one hand, but on the other hand, it still appears as a civilian government led by Konoe, so it can obtain the last possible benefits from Britain and the United States through the traditional policy of advocating "strengthening the moderate elements in Japan." Foreign Minister Guo said that this policy is nothing more than appeasement. Foreign Minister Guo said, "The Japanese cabinet is especially useful when dealing with the United States, because there are many idealists in the United States." When Foreign Minister Guo discussed the United States still supplying Japan with oil and other goods, he said, "This matter is very similar to Britain's policy of appeasement towards Italy, because after the start of the European war, Britain allowed Italy to store oil and other important raw materials, hoping to prevent Italy from uniting with Germany. As a result, Britain helped Italy arm itself to fight against itself. I believe that the United States' policy will also have the same result."

Chongqing, 20th, Taiwan Business News - Those Chinese people who are familiar with Japanese affairs claim that although the new Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda has no reputation abroad, he belongs to the hard-line faction in the Navy. It is said that Toyoda served twice as a minor representative in the Japanese delegation to the London Naval Conference, but he opposed Japan's signing of the convention negotiated at the naval conference. Toyoda has always opposed Japan's agreement to the Washington and London Naval Treaties.

Central Daily News Discusses Japanese Military Trends

Chongqing, 20th, Reuters - According to well-informed sources here, since the reorganization of the Konoe Cabinet in Japan, there are three possible actions: (1) block Vladivostok and invade Siberia by land, (2) seize southern Vietnam and put renewed pressure on Thailand, (3) invade Yunnan Province to cut off the Burma Road. This morning, the Central Daily News published an article stating that Japan may attack north or south, and that the United States' position in the Pacific has been greatly enhanced due to recent international developments. There are now three possible routes that the United States may use to attack Japan, namely (1) the northern route via Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, (2) the central route via Hawaii, Wake Island, and Guam, (3) the southern route via Hawaii and Samoa. Japanese naval experts have always insisted that only the southern route is feasible, but the current situation is completely different. The close cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States has made the northern route also visible in practice. Moreover, because the United States is stepping up its defenses in the Pacific, the US Navy can not only ensure the safety of its ships along the central route but also effectively bomb the islands under Japanese rule. As for the United States' position along the southern route, it has been further strengthened due to the joint defense of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, India, and Australia. In other words, whether Japan advances south or attacks north, it has little hope of achieving its goals. In addition, the Japanese new cabinet's announcement of its determination to resolve the China Incident has aroused speculation as to whether Japan is on the eve of launching another large-scale offensive against China. People here believe that since Japan is currently withdrawing its troops from the Yangtze River Basin, it is unlikely to attack Chongqing to the west. It is said that if the Japanese army advances westward from Shanxi Province, crosses the Yellow River, and attacks Xi'an, although it will bring the Japanese army deep into northwestern China, even if this offensive is successful, it will not be able to force China to abandon its resistance in the near future. Therefore, some people believe that Japan may use Vietnam as a base to attack Yunnan Province to cut off the Burma Road, so as to prevent the continuous arrival of American supplies in Chongqing. However, since Japan occupied northern Vietnam, the Chinese Supreme Command has taken all necessary precautions, and a strong Chinese army has been gathered along the Vietnamese border to deal with possible invasions of Yunnan Province. Not only will the United States make various efforts to maintain the opening of the Burma Road so that it can rush aircraft to help China's resistance, but it is expected that Britain will also take similar actions, because Japan's invasion of Yunnan Province will threaten the safety of Burma, the rear gateway to Singapore.

Chongqing Believes Japanese Government is Completely Fascist

Chongqing, 19th, Havas - This morning, all newspapers commented on the new Japanese cabinet, with the Ta Kung Pao being the most insightful and agreed upon by all parties. The newspaper said that the new Japanese cabinet is completely a war-preparedness cabinet, with soldiers accounting for seven of the fourteen cabinet members and no political party figures. This shows the deepening of military fascism. Once the war participation system is prepared, the cabinet must be reorganized again. As for the trend of participating in the war, it should be north first and south second. Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should know that it is extremely stupid to wait for Japan to launch an attack before responding. It is extremely smart and sensitive to strike Japan first. If the United States continues to appease Japan by providing it with oil, steel, and other resources, then its crime of stupidity will reach the heavens. The newspaper also predicts that the new cabinet will not last more than two months.

Tokyo, 19th, Havas - Since the establishment of the new Japanese cabinet, political figures here have recently commented that the new Foreign Minister Teijiro Toyoda has no diplomatic experience and can only implement Konoe's policies. Therefore, Prime Minister Konoe will occupy an important position in the government's foreign policy. Although the outgoing Foreign Minister Matsuoka was the most powerful figure in supporting the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, Matsuoka's departure this time cannot be regarded as a loosening of Japan's relationship with the Axis powers. On the contrary, the Japanese government will repeatedly state that Japan's foreign policy will still center on the Tripartite Pact, and its obligations to the Axis powers will be explained in a moderate manner. According to Prime Minister Konoe's intention, when the Tripartite Pact was signed in September 1940, the Japanese Emperor issued an edict to the whole country, saying that the Tripartite Pact was an instrument to prevent the European war from spreading to the Far East. Based on this, the main direction of the new cabinet's foreign policy is to try its best to avoid a war between the United States and Japan. Even Prime Minister Konoe himself believes that the United States and Japan can at least temporarily maintain the status quo. If the situation can improve, further action should be taken. It is rumored that Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura attempted to establish a non-aggression treaty with the United States, which also originated from this. It is expected that Japan will not remain in a passive position. The important decision taken by the government at the Imperial Conference on July 2 was agreed upon in advance. It is difficult to announce the content of this decision at this time. However, the Japanese government has encountered an important problem, which is to prevent the conspiracy of "encircling Japan." The feeling of being surrounded by the Japanese Co-Prosperity Sphere is becoming increasingly obvious, and it will soon take all necessary measures to prepare for the worst. After Germany defeats the Soviet Union, the international situation will allow Japan to take action. According to the information received by the government, if the Soviet Union's resistance is defeated by Germany, the United States will no longer be able to pay attention to the port of Vladivostok. In addition, although the military occupies a majority in the new cabinet, extreme elements do not occupy key positions. Therefore, we should not overestimate the power of the military. Tojo is the most powerful figure in supporting Konoe's policies and still remains as Minister of the Army. Regardless of cabinet ministers Lieutenant General Yanagawa and Baron Hiranuma, both are conservative figures, while Minister of Health and Welfare Koizumi, who used to be a military medical officer, has no political color. There are also three people from the Navy in the cabinet: Admiral Oikawa as Minister of the Navy, Admiral Toyoda as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Vice Admiral Sakonji Seizo as Minister of Commerce and Industry. Foreign Minister Toyoda is very familiar with the diplomatic policies that the Japanese Navy and Army can implement.

Japanese Newspaper Believes There Will Be No Changes in the New Cabinet's Diplomacy

Tokyo, 20th, Haitong News - According to the Japanese newspapers' elaboration and Prime Minister Konoe's statement after the cabinet reshuffle, the new Japanese cabinet will proceed in accordance with its previous policies. What the new cabinet is concerned about is the construction of Greater Asia. Regarding whether Japan's foreign policy is still based on the Tripartite Pact, the new Foreign Minister Toyoda said, "Our basic policy will never change." Prime Minister Konoe has made it clear. The Japan-Japan News stated that the new Japanese cabinet will further strengthen the policy of the Tripartite Pact. The new Japanese government is determined to follow a firm policy to solve the important problems facing Japan. The Sino-Foreign Commercial News stated that half of the Japanese cabinet members are representatives of the Navy and Army, which shows that Japan is standing at the gate of war. The Hochi Shimbun also expressed the same opinion, hoping that the Soviet-German war can enable Japan to quickly resolve the Sino-Japanese Incident.

American Newspapers Comment on the Policies of the New Japanese Cabinet

Washington, 20th, Reuters - Observers here generally believe that Matsuoka's departure from the Japanese cabinet is the most important change in Tokyo. However, it is difficult for commentators to estimate the significance of the change of Japanese Foreign Minister because the successor is a person whose political views are not known. The Washington Post stated that Matsuoka's departure does not necessarily mean that Japan's relationship with the Axis powers will change rapidly. However, Matsuoka has made his country subject to the realization of policies that have proven to be contradictory and feels ashamed, so he resigned. It is expected that Japan will still sit on the fence until it sees that the benefits of its aggressive policies outweigh the harms. However, this waiting opportunity may not be very long, because Japan's only business today is to fight, and other considerations are not important. The New York Bulletin stated that it knows nothing about the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet except that Konoe obtained the consent of the Navy and Army to launch the cabinet reshuffle in order to remove Matsuoka. Matsuoka must have promised Hitler to attack Siberia. Hitler may not want Japan to attack the Soviet Union from both sides now, and Japanese army leaders may not be willing to fight the Soviet army in the Far East with their limited troops and resources. The only thing that can be believed is that Matsuoka has promised Hitler that Japan will cause great disturbance in the Pacific. Now that Japan is not prepared to do so and wants to withdraw its previous words, it can only remove Matsuoka from office. The new Japanese cabinet is not a peace cabinet. Its members are mostly naval and army personnel, which shows that it is determined to expand. However, its planned expansion cannot give Germany much comfort. It is a sign of Japan's southward advance that a naval officer is in charge of diplomacy, because the southward advance is where the Navy's ambition lies and is also the task of Konoe's new cabinet. However, the actions of the Japanese Navy do not completely follow Hitler's lead, but only engage in expansion when it is harmless. Now, no matter what actions Japan takes in Vietnam and Thailand to prepare for more intense actions against the United States in the future, Japan's foreign policy will temporarily remain uninteresting, just like its new foreign minister is uninteresting.

Britain Believes Japan Will Soon Attack Thailand and Vietnam

London, 19th - London and Washington are closely watching the development of the situation in Tokyo, because the measures of the new cabinet are enough to affect the situation in the Pacific. Observations here suggest that if there are no other major unexpected changes, Japan's invasion of Vietnam and Thailand is only a matter of time and will be seen in a few days. Although Germany is urging Japan to attack the Soviet Union from both sides, Japan seems determined to adopt an independent opportunistic policy. The benefits must be limited to Japan alone. Japan is in dire need of oil, rice, tin, and rubber. There are many of these materials in the South Pacific, but Siberia lacks them. Japan's war against China has become thorny, and it is unwilling to launch a large-scale war to avoid falling into an uncontrollable situation again. Japan has experience with the Soviet Union in the Changkufeng Incident. The Soviet Union's heroic resistance against the German blitzkrieg has also lasted for four weeks. Japan should also know that the danger of attacking Siberia is great. On the contrary, if Japan implements a southward advance without causing conflict with Britain and the United States, the resistance it encounters will be weak, and it may even encounter no resistance. Japan knows that Britain and the United States will oppose Japan's occupation of naval and air force bases in Thailand and Vietnam, which will endanger Singapore and affect the strategic situation in the South Seas. However, Japan also believes that Britain and the United States will not take positive measures against Japan merely for this reason. Japan expects that Britain and the United States may unite to implement economic measures to deal with Japan (this matter is said to be under discussion by British and American authorities), but Japan is clearly prepared to resist the joint economic measures of Britain and the United States. Japan recently deliberately spread the rumor of a Sino-British military alliance to test the reaction of Britain and the United States to Japan's occupation of Vietnam and Thailand. It is expected here that after Japan occupies Vietnam and Thailand, it will wait for an opportunity before implementing the second step of its plan. This matter will largely depend on the outcome of the German-Soviet war.

Dutch East Indies Pays Close Attention to the Reshuffle of the Japanese Cabinet

Batavia, 20th, United Press - Dutch people have not commented much on the reshuffle of the Japanese cabinet in the past two days. One of the leaders said that the reshuffle of the Japanese cabinet is to show that Japan's policy will become purely Japanese in nature, and this change may be even worse. The official also said that this change of the Japanese cabinet further shows that the Nazis have obviously lost power in Japan. However, in any case, we should strictly adhere to an independent policy. Even if the number of military personnel in the Japanese cabinet increases, we do not care. In general, it is recalled that the Netherlands recently refused Japan's request because it feared that exported goods would be transshipped to Germany. The meaning of the remarks of a Dutch official today must be to maintain the right to independent negotiations regardless of Japan's new policies, and not to be subjected to military pressure. Dutch people here also said that the words of British Far East Commander General Brooke-Popham, "We are already prepared," can represent the attitude of the Dutch East Indies.

Vichy, 20th, Haitong News - French Cabinet Associate and Foreign Minister Admiral Darlan met with Japanese Ambassador to France Kato after the cabinet meeting last night. According to official reports, Kato made a brief statement on the diplomatic policies of the new Japanese cabinet.

Vichy, 19th, Havas - Well-informed sources said that Darlan's meeting with Sato was of no great significance. Generally, Ambassador Sato informed Associate Darlan of the reshuffle of the Japanese cabinet. Since the new Japanese Foreign Minister, Admiral Toyoda, is a naval general, observers are paying close attention to the development of the situation in the Far East. Also, because Vietnam's status has not changed so far, and France still has extensive interests in Asia, people are paying more attention to this. However, observers believe that Japan's future actions will still focus on China.

Saigon, 20th, Reuters - It is learned that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux is scheduled to return to Hanoi from Saigon on Monday with all his entourage. It was previously rumored that Governor Decoux would stay in Saigon as usual to escape the summer heat until the end of August. Now there is a sudden rumor that he will return to Hanoi, which has attracted attention. It is not yet certain whether it is related to the rumored Japanese plan to go deep into southern Vietnam. It is estimated that Governor Decoux will meet with the Japanese delegation to the border survey committee, as the Japanese representatives will arrive in Haiphong today.

Saigon, 20th, Reuters - Officials explained the reason why Governor Decoux will suddenly return to Hanoi on Monday, saying that Governor Decoux has been away from Hanoi for a long time and has accumulated a lot of official duties, so he needs to go there to handle them. He should be able to return to Saigon in mid-August. Yesterday, two important officials came to Saigon to report everything to Governor Decoux.

### Vichy Held a Cabinet Meeting the Night Before to Discuss French-German Relations and the New Situation in the Far East

Vichy, 20th, United Press - The cabinet met with Chief Pétain for two hours yesterday, reviewing the general situation, especially regarding the relations between France and Germany and the tension in the Far East.

Vichy, 20th, United Press - A communiqué was issued after the cabinet meeting yesterday that Darlan may appoint another Foreign Minister. When Bouthillier was appointed as Minister of the Interior, Darlan began to delegate some of the positions he currently holds. Newspapers in Paris under German control remained silent on Bouthillier's appointment yesterday. The reason for this was not willing to be clarified. Although the official communiqué announced the appointment, no Paris newspaper published it.

Vichy, 20th, Haitong News - A communiqué issued after yesterday's cabinet meeting stated that as a result of the meeting, no proposal to reorganize the French cabinet was passed. The establishment of a committee for the return of French prisoners of war to the country was the most important of the proposals.

Vichy, 19th, Havas - The Council of State decided today to establish an office for the management of prisoners of war during the war to handle the affairs of releasing and returning prisoners of war to the country.

### Howarth Advocates Delaying Export Tax on the Philippines

United Press, Washington, 20th—Former Senator and drafter of the Philippine Independence Act, Howarth, yesterday urged the passage of a one-year suspension of the Philippine export tax to assist the Philippine economy and defend against aggression. Howarth's suggestion was written in an advertisement distributed by the Philippine Sugar Company. The advertisement stated that over two million people rely on the sugar industry for their livelihood, and they will be affected if the export tax is not suspended. Now there is a country contemplating invasion, and if we cause discord by failing to maintain food and other daily necessities, it would be giving the aggressor a special invitation.

### Even if the Far Eastern Situation is Extremely Serious, Shanghai's Status Will Not Change; Its International Character Must Exist; The Legal Rights and Interests of the Chinese People Should Be Respected and Protected.

Although the Japanese cabinet reshuffle appears more moderate on the surface, the fact that Konoe, who has a close relationship with the military, has succeeded as prime minister indicates that Japan will sooner or later take another military action, with a southward advance being particularly likely. Therefore, the Far Eastern situation has reached a new turning point. Shanghai's status, due to the outbreak of Pacific warfare after Japan's southward advance, is even more closely related to the millions of Chinese people in this city. The opinions expressed on this issue by a foreign commentator in this city are recorded below:

The Status Quo of Shanghai Must Be Maintained

Regardless of how rapidly the international situation changes, the status quo of Shanghai must always be maintained. Even if the conflict between the United States and Japan breaks out in full force, Shanghai's international character must be ensured. Before the war, some people advocated abolishing Shanghai's international character, but if anyone still sings this tune today, it is tantamount to falling into the trap of treacherous people, destroying Shanghai's legal status of the past century in one fell swoop. If there is no resolute determination to prevent such a latent possibility from occurring, the future holds endless hidden dangers. Especially when the overall situation tends to change, we must be careful to maintain Shanghai's traditional status quo.

The Interests of the Chinese People Should Be Respected

The so-called maintenance of Shanghai's international character, as far as the current situation is concerned, has the following implications: (1) The balance of power between the various countries in Shanghai must continue; (2) All countries must have equal opportunities for industrial and commercial development in Shanghai; (3) The rights enjoyed by the expatriates of all countries in Shanghai, even if the environment is not equal, must not be used as a basis for benefiting oneself at the expense of others; (4) The administrative power of the concessions should maintain its consistent independence, and all matters should be handled impartially without favoritism; (5) Make every effort to suppress terrorist cases of any background, so as not to create an excuse favorable to any party; (6) The legitimate interests of the Chinese people must be respected and protected as before the war. To summarize the above six points, Shanghai must do its best to remain neutral at present, and not allow the power of any country or any party to develop in a special and deformed manner.

Compromise and Appeasement Are Absolutely Not Advisable

The countries related to Shanghai themselves may lose their neutrality due to sudden changes in the situation and the sudden outbreak of war, but in their relations with Shanghai, they must continue their consistent policy of maintaining a balance of power, and must not willingly compromise and appease, so that other countries or forces may have a chance to take the lead. In other words, Shanghai's status quo should not change due to changes in the international situation, but should stand in a detached position and continue to develop and progress in a satisfactory manner. Otherwise, the situation in Shanghai will inevitably deteriorate day by day, to the point of being irreparable. The legitimate rights and status of both Chinese and Westerners will be wiped out.

The Positions of Britain and the United States Must Be Firm

In essence, the two sides of Shanghai's balance of power are Britain, the United States, and other countries that adopt the same position as Britain and the United States, and Japan and its affiliated forces, as well as its allies, Germany and Italy. The extent to which the current balance of power is maintained is well known, but the future balance of power depends on the attitude of Britain and the United States. In other words, if the balance of power in Shanghai is to be maintained, Britain and the United States must not take any appeasement or compromise measures in Shanghai due to changes in the international situation. Otherwise, appeasement will become submission, and compromise will become indulgence. Not only will their own rights and interests be completely eliminated, but the entire situation in Shanghai will be in dire straits and beyond salvation.

Citizens Must Be Vigilant and Aware

The vigilance and awareness of the citizens of Shanghai itself are also conducive to maintaining the situation in Shanghai. In other words, the citizens of Shanghai should be determined to suppress any events that may occur that are sufficient to change the situation in Shanghai, and should use strong public opinion to counter any special expansion of any force. The spiritual strength of the people cannot be destroyed by military intimidation and massacre. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety of Shanghai's future, on the one hand, Britain and the United States must take the initiative to eliminate the root of compromise and appeasement, and on the other hand, it must be promoted and supported by the spiritual power of the people.

### U.S. Red Cross Concerned About Refugees, Wheat Arrives in Shanghai Today, to Be Distributed in This City and Occupied Areas

According to reports from the local economic associations, the American Red Cross has been informed that there is an urgent need for medical supplies and relief wheat. In addition to rushing a shipment of medicines worth US$1 million, the Arleigh, weighing 6,751 tons, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, carrying 2 million pounds of crushed wheat and 50,000 pounds of milk powder, commissioned by the Red Cross. The ship came from Seattle on June 15th and could have arrived here on the 19th, but the voyage was delayed due to bad weather. Following this, the Capillo (weighing 3,127 tons), which was ordered from Seattle to carry 20,000 pounds of crushed wheat to Shanghai, is also expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th of this month. These relief supplies will be distributed separately in Shanghai and the occupied areas. It is also learned that since the departure of President Pierce with Mr. Sanders, the president of the association, the vacancy here will be temporarily filled by Mr. Garda. The new president, Mr. Anderson, will arrive in Shanghai by the end of next month to take office.

### Abundant Harvests in Thailand and Vietnam Reduce the Cost of Foreign Rice; Hong Kong Rice Awaits Opportunity to Restore Original Price

According to shipping industry sources, the Thai ship Sisinnon and the French ship Grand Datana entered the port yesterday, loading Siamese rice and Saigon rice respectively, totaling more than 80,000 bags, a quantity rarely seen recently. The city's rice reserves have increased further, already exceeding 1.2 million bags. It is heard that this year's output of foreign rice in Thailand and Vietnam is very abundant, and the market price has fallen. Rice importers find the cost favorable and have recently placed many new orders. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands more bags will arrive by the end of the month. The price of rice is bound to plummet. The Shanghai Municipal Council's price limit will also have to be restored to the original price of 310 yuan per picul.

Goods Arrive in Swarms, Market Prices Unstable

Since the authorities of the two concessions adopted both standard and expedient measures to actively stabilize the food supply for the people in this city, the various measures have shown effective results. Not only are the sources arriving in swarms, and the reserves have increased sharply, but large households hoarding goods have lost their grip. The prices of various types of rice present a fluctuating and unstable situation. Therefore, the hidden dangers in the food supply for the people of this city have been completely resolved. Rice speculators will inevitably suffer a serious blow. However, the two authorities are determined to adhere to their original intention and continue to adopt effective measures to stabilize the entire food supply, in order to reduce the burden on the common people by gradually lowering the price of rice and ensuring social security. A reporter from the Xin She News Agency learned from the Jianghai Customs yesterday that:

Rice Arrivals in Six Months

From June of this year, a total of 436,556 hectoliters of foreign rice were shipped to Shanghai from Myanmar, Annam, Thailand, etc., worth 4,271,150 gold units, equivalent to 11,562,003 yuan in national currency. Myanmar accounted for the most, with 242,374 hectoliters, worth 2,411,649 gold units. Second was Annam, with 177,703 hectoliters, worth 1,700,097 gold units. Third was Thailand, with 3,009 hectoliters, worth 50,099 gold units. As for the six months from January to June of this year, a total of 4,048,448 hectoliters of foreign rice were shipped to Shanghai from overseas, worth 30,843,540 gold units, equivalent to 83,493,463 yuan in national currency. In terms of the destination of rice this year, the reserves of various Chinese and foreign rice warehouses should be considerable. The daily rice needs of the four million Chinese and foreign residents, where is there a shortage?

### Greek King's Birthday Yesterday, Greek Community Celebrates Enthusiastically, Vows Loyalty to Support Revival

Yesterday was the 50th birthday of King George II of Greece. The Greek community in this city celebrated enthusiastically. The Greek Consulate General in Shanghai and other institutions flew flags and took a holiday. The entire Greek community in Shanghai pledged loyalty to the government of their motherland and continued to donate generously to meet the needs of the Greek Red Cross and other organizations.

### Overseas Chinese in the U.S. Jointly Subscribe to Half of the Yunnan-Burma Railway Bonds

In order to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway, the National Government, together with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications, issued US$10 million in Yunnan-Burma Railway Gold Public Bonds of the Republic of China in 1941, with a fixed interest rate of 5% per annum, with principal and interest paid once every six months. Only interest will be paid for the first three years, and principal will be repaid once from 1944, and will be paid off in 25 years, with the profits of the Yunnan-Burma Railway as the fund. According to a reporter from the Ping Ming News Agency's inquiry to the financial community, the Yunnan-Burma Railway Gold Public Bonds have been approved by the U.S. government for issuance in the U.S. The amount subscribed by overseas Chinese in the U.S. has exceeded US$5 million. However, these bonds are currently being printed and can be exchanged for bonds with the subscription form upon completion of printing. The interest will be calculated from July 1st.

### Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund, Social Support is Increasingly Strong; Mr. Huang Yuzhai Encourages Friends and Relatives to Donate, Enthusiastic Readers Express Touching Opinions

Yesterday was the ninth day of soliciting donations for the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund, which coincided with a Sunday, and a large amount of donations poured in, approaching 1,000 yuan, which is the highest record. If the readers can use this spirit of continuous efforts to promote any social undertaking, it can be guaranteed that it will be successful.

Yesterday's Donation Records

The largest donation yesterday was 500 yuan from Mr. Huang Yuzhai, 300 yuan from Lian Ji, 50 yuan from Mr. Li Renting, 40 yuan from Mr. Zhu Wenkui, 33 yuan and 5 jiao from Gu Qiying’s wife, Fang Xiude, Wang Wenjie, Zhang Yongling, Zhou Maojun, Dai Wenhai, Tu Qiwu, Lu Xiuyu, Fu Boliang, Yang Shunbao, and Zhu Youlong. 20 yuan from Mr. Wu Peicheng, 10 yuan from Mr. Huang Hui, 10 yuan from Yang Ruxiang for the wedding of Qian Xin Zhi, Wen Lang, and Qian Ting. 2 yuan from Mr. Zhang, and 1 yuan from Ms. Liu Jieding, and 1 yuan from Mr. Chen Bingnan. The total amount is 967 yuan and 5 jiao. The previous balance was 4,603 yuan, 6 jiao, and 2 fen, totaling 5,571 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen.

Appealing to Friends and Relatives to Save Money to Help Students

Mr. Huang Yuzhai, the owner of Huizhong Bank, who donated the most yesterday, wrote in a letter: "Yuzhai was born in a poor family and lost his schooling at a young age. I empathize with others and have many feelings. Although I have established several charity schools, I am still unable to make it widespread due to limited resources. I have always regretted this in private. Although I am now somewhat self-reliant, I feel uneducated and guilty as soon as I enter the world. Now that the national crisis is not over, there are tens of millions of young people who have lost their schooling, and there are many pillars of future society among them, just like Yuzhai, who are suffering from bad circumstances. Shen Bao is where I used to work, and we are closely related. Now I am launching the Reader Scholarship Fund to benefit poor students. I am very excited to hear about it. I should have taken the lead and run around to solicit donations, but I am still unable to travel because I am recovering from a serious illness. Therefore, I dare to use a corner of this newspaper to respectfully tell my friends and relatives on behalf of thousands of students, please donate as much as you can, so that you can accumulate small amounts to make a fortune, enrich the donation, and reduce the number of people who drop out of school. Yuzhai has both money and lacks strength, and although he has a lot of heart, he is mostly ashamed. Therefore, I saved 500 yuan in fees to do my part. It is really not enough to say that I am advocating, but among my new and old friends, there are many wealthy people. At this time of the hot summer, the amount consumed by mouth can be deducted and used as a donation, and the amount should also be considerable. Yuzhai is willing to lead the way and bow his head to thank the thousands of students who have dropped out of school."

An Ama Sells Newspapers, Her Ambition is Commendable

Liu Jieding, an ama who works as a maid in a Westerner's house on Xianhe Temple Road in Shanghai, donated the proceeds from selling old newspapers yesterday to help students, and said, "I did not study much when I was young, and I am very ashamed to be a nanny for Westerners' children. I am very supportive of the scholarship fund mentioned in the newspaper. I have two sons and two daughters who are studying in the free area of eastern Zhejiang, and they often receive assistance from others. I deeply feel that this work is urgent." Mr. Li Renting also wrote in a letter: "If we can provide more assistance to ambitious students outside the school circle, it will be more effective than those in school, because they have personally experienced difficult circumstances and their motivation to move forward is very strong."

Ms. Gu Qiying from Sa Po Sai Elementary School has already solicited donations for the scholarship fund for the third time yesterday, working hard for the disaster-stricken children. Her enthusiasm and perseverance are truly admirable. Her father, Mr. Gu Dadong, provided guidance from the side, which also contributed to the family education.

### Small Bugs Found in Tap Water

Many small bugs have been found in the tap water of the Public Concession. There are both brown and red ones. The residents are deeply concerned that this may be detrimental to hygiene, especially during the hot summer. The company also admitted that these kinds of bugs exist, but said that they are actively working to eliminate them, and firmly believe that these bugs will not have any impact on health.

### Commercial Press Reopens Today, Severance Pay Has Been Fully Paid, Great Eastern Labor Dispute Unresolved

The entire staff of the Commercial Press General Distribution Office on Henan Road, the Xiafei Road branch on Jing'an Temple Road, and the various printing plants, plate-making factories, warehouses, etc., totaling about 1,000 people, have been suspended from work for three months due to demands for better treatment. Subsequently, a contract was signed under the supervision of the authorities by both labor and management to comply. It is heard that about 500 people were laid off this time, and only 402 were retained. The severance pay paid by the museum was about 800,000 yuan. Now, the retained museum staff have completed the internal reorganization, and it has been decided that they will officially resume normal business starting today.

Great Eastern Labor Dispute

All the messengers of the Great Eastern Telegraph Company at 34 Edward Road launched a go-slow strike at noon the day before yesterday (Saturday) because they were dissatisfied with the company's refusal to issue a year-end bonus from London. However, yesterday was Sunday, and the company was closed as usual. The two sides did not negotiate, so the labor dispute is still deadlocked.

### To Go to Beidaihe for Summer Vacation, Approval Must Be Obtained in Tanggu

The U.S. Consulate General here recently received information from the U.S. Consulate General in Tianjin that travelers from Shanghai to Tanggu and Qinhuangdao can obtain permission to go to Beidaihe for summer vacation in those two places. Those who stay in Beidaihe for less than a month can be allowed to return to Shanghai with permission. If they plan to stay longer, they must obtain approval from the Tianjin authorities.

### Japanese Merchants Fined for Selling Pig Iron to Chinese, License Revoked

According to the Japanese-language "Continental New Daily," Nagashima Koyoriji, a 57-year-old Japanese man residing at 130 Peng Road in Hongkou, was recently found by the Economic Police of the Japanese Consulate General to have sold a large amount of pig iron to Chinese people. On the 14th of this month, he was punished by having his business license revoked. It is claimed that the Japanese man established an iron factory at 456 Kunming Road in Yangshupu in September 1938. Because he saw that trading with the Chinese side was more profitable, he continuously sold pig iron to Chinese merchants from March to June of this year, totaling more than 300 tons. He could earn a net profit of 600 yuan per ton more than trading with Japanese merchants.

### Most of the Real Estate Along the Bund is Being Prepared for Sale, Soaring Market Prices are the Main Reason for the Transactions, Not Related to the Future of the Far Eastern Situation

According to well-informed sources, as of yesterday, the sale of the Grosvenor House on the Bund has not yet been formally completed and should be completed within the next few days. According to real estate market news in this city, most of the land along the Bund is currently being negotiated for sale and is in the final stages. However, according to investigations, not all of the real estate being sold recently belongs to British property. There are also many American and Chinese properties. However, the owners are unwilling to disclose the news of the sale, so the outside world does not know the truth. Recently, the sale of the property at 160 Edward Road and the vacant lot next to the Zhang Garden swimming pool on Jing'an Temple Road, the transfer of the Cathay Mansion, and the negotiation of this Grosvenor House have caused various rumors, and it is suspected that the real estate being sold belongs to British and American people, which is not without speculation about the future of the Far Eastern situation. However, according to people in the market, the recent activity in real estate sales is purely due to the high profits.

### The Anti-Aggression War Has Entered a Bright Path, The Establishment of the British-Soviet Alliance Greatly Boosts Morale, The Defeat of the Axis Powers is Imminent, Commentary by the Russian Newspaper Zaitsev

A Russian-language newspaper in this city published an article yesterday, clearing up the international situation in recent weeks. The author, Zaitsev, is an expert in international affairs. The various issues mentioned are very concise. His feelings and perceptions reflect the Soviet Union's attitude towards the situation. Here is a translation of the original text:

The Time for Settlement with Germany Has Arrived

The major developments in the international situation in recent weeks are as follows: (1) Britain and the Soviet Union signed a military agreement, stipulating that neither party will separately make peace with Germany and will fight side by side until Nazism is annihilated. Therefore, the establishment of this treaty will inevitably boost the morale of the people suffering under Hitler's shackles. This is tantamount to showing them that the day for settlement with Hitler has arrived. (2) The brave Red Army has repeatedly dealt blows to the German army. The number of tanks, aircraft, and military supplies lost by the Germans is countless. The number of soldiers killed and wounded is also in the millions. Hitler will no longer be able to deceive himself with blitzkrieg tactics. The Red Army has succeeded in counterattacking in several places, and the German army is on the eve of collapse. Looking to the future, the butcher will shiver in the cold. The Soviet border will probably serve as the tomb of the Hitler Party.

Japan Seems Likely to Advance Southward in the Future

(3) Although Konoe's resignation and cabinet reshuffle have not announced Japan's future policy, judging from various signs, Japan seems to have the intention of advancing southward, eyeing opportunities and preying on the weak. Vietnam and Thailand have probably become its targets. (4) The United States occupies Iceland and builds naval and air bases. In the future, Hitler will only be able to sigh in vain when he wants to expand his power in the Atlantic Ocean. (5) The British occupation of Syria and the signing of a treaty with the Vichy government's official in Syria have made it impossible for the Axis powers to develop in the Near East in the near future.

The Chinese Army Will Launch a Counterattack Soon

(6) After China obtained a large number of aircraft from the United States, the strength of the Chinese Air Force has doubled. China will use the assistance of the new air force to launch a counterattack in the shortest possible time. (7) The United States is constantly encircling Japan in the South China Sea and is acting in concert with Britain, determined to protect the safety of the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, and the Philippines.

The Western Front is Favorable to Britain

(8) British aircraft repeatedly attacked Germany, causing great losses to the Ruhr area and western Germany. (9) The Atlantic war situation has become more favorable to the Allied forces. The British army's resistance is strong, and the German side will no longer be able to sink large numbers of British ships. (10) The production of aircraft, tanks, and weapons in the United States has increased sharply. Recently, the British army has been able to overwhelm the enemy with its superior air force on various fronts. (11) The resistance in the areas occupied by the German army is increasing day by day, and the anti-Soviet war is even more despised by the nations under its enslavement. To sum up, the whole world has awakened and is now carrying out the great cause of anti-fascist freedom and liberation. These conditions of struggle have made the situation of assisting the Allied countries increasingly bright. The Axis countries will have major political and military failures in the near future. We can wait and see.

### American Reporter Steel to Go to Moscow

Steel, the Chicago Daily News correspondent in the Far East, will travel to Moscow recently. Steel was previously a reporter for the New York Times in Beiping. During the Sino-Japanese War, he traveled to Java, Thailand, Burma, and India from time to time. He recently returned to Shanghai from a trip on the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is rumored that his vacancy will be filled by Stuart Emeny, who is currently en route to Shanghai. According to reports, Emeny is also a famous reporter. Several years before the European War, he served as the head of the Paris bureau of the New York World, and won the Pulitzer Prize. Later, he served as a reporter for the Chicago Daily News and witnessed the German invasion of Norway, and then dispatched sensational news dispatches from there and Finland. Later, he served as a political reporter for a radio station.

### Origin of Buddhism

The 19th session of the Rong Wu Sutra Study Society, Mr. Yang Zhongyi lectured on the origin of Buddhism. The founder of Buddhism, Shakyamuni, in Chinese means "Capable Benevolence," surnamed Gautama, named Siddhartha. His father was King Suddhodana, ruler of Kapilavastu, and his mother was Maya, daughter of the ruler of Koliya. He was born on the eighth day of the fourth month of the fifteenth year of King Ling of the Zhou dynasty, which is 58 BC in the Western calendar, under a Sala tree in Lumbini Garden, according to the Essentials of Eastern History and the Dictionary of Important Events. The Essentials of History states that his father died in the second year of King Jing, which is 543 BC, which is close to the legends of Ceylon and Tibet, and therefore credible. Some also say he was born in the fifth year of King Jing, or the 27th year of King Xiang. Xie Cheng's "Chronicles of the Later Han Dynasty," Wei Shou's "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism," and Fei Changfang's "Three Records of the Kaihuang Era" all state that he was born in the tenth year of King Zhuang, or the seventh year of Duke Zhuang of Lu, when a comet was seen in the Spring and Autumn Annals as an auspicious sign. During the Six Dynasties period, the legend of Lao Tzu transforming the barbarians became widespread, and they competed for precedence, pushing the date further and further back, leading to the reigns of King Huan and King Ping. In the second year of the Zhenguan era of the Tang dynasty, an edict ordered Fa Xianglin to further push the birth back to the reign of King Zhao of the Western Zhou, and there were even claims of birth during the reigns of King Wu Yi of the Shang dynasty and Jie of the Xia dynasty, with the birth year differing by as much as a thousand years, which is astonishing! See Yang Jianxing's "Examination of the Birth Year of Shakyamuni" for details.

Furthermore, the accounts of the introduction of Buddhism into China that can be verified are Yuan Hong's "Chronicles of the Later Han Dynasty" and Fan Ye's "Book of the Later Han Dynasty, Records of the Western Regions," which state: "It is said that Emperor Ming dreamed of a golden man and asked his ministers. Some said, 'In the West, there is a god named Buddha.' Thereupon, he sent envoys to India to inquire about the Buddhist doctrines, and subsequently obtained images in Chinese books. Prince Ying of Chu was the first to believe in his arts." Neither book provides a specific year, and the "Buddhist Ancestor's Comprehensive Record" of Zhi Pan of the Song dynasty sets it as the tenth year of Yongping. However, the "Comprehensive Record of Buddhist Ancestors Through the Ages" sets it seven years earlier, and the "Expanded Collection of Bright Expositions" says three years earlier. The envoys sent are listed in the "Collection of Records of the Three Pitakas," volume 42. The preface to the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters says it was Zhang Qian and twelve others, the "Three Records of Past Dynasties" says it was Qin Jing and fourteen others, and the "Comprehensive Record" says it was Cai Yin and eighteen others. The destination is said to be either India or Yuezhi, and what they brought back is said to be either Buddha images or Buddhist scriptures. Wang Yan's "Records of Hidden Omens" first stated that Kashyapa Matanga came east, and the "Biographies of Eminent Monks" added Dharmaraksha, making it two monks who arrived in Luoyang together. Wei Shou's "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" also states: "In the first year of the Yuanshou era of Emperor Ai, the king of Yuezhi sent Yicun to orally transmit the Sutra of the Buddha to Qin Jingxian." The "Records of the Western Regions" of the Wei Lue makes it Jing Lu. Zong Bing's "Discussion on Clarifying Buddhism" and the annotation in the "Literary Matters" chapter of the "New Account of Tales of the World" quoting Liu Xiang's "Biographies of Immortals" "Seventy-four people in the Buddhist scriptures" place it during the reign of Emperor Cheng. The "Book Evidence" chapter of the "Yan Family Instructions" states, "The praise saying 'Seventy-four people came from the Buddhist scriptures' was added by later generations and is not part of the original text." The "Treatise on Buddhism and Taoism" also states, "Zhang Qian was sent to Bactria and first heard of the teachings of the Buddha." It also says, "During the Yuanshou era of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty, a golden statue of the Xiongnu king was obtained, and incense was burned and worship was offered." Wang Jian's "Stories of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty" says the same. Zong Bing further states, "Dongfang Shuo spoke of cosmic kalpas, indicating he knew of Buddhism," placing it during the reign of Emperor Wu. However, Fan Ye's "Records of the Western Regions" comments, "Buddhism and Taoism are divinely transformed, originating in India, but neither the local records of the two Han dynasties mention them." Going further back, it is said that during the reign of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, foreign monks named Shilifang and others came to convert with Buddhist scriptures, as seen in the catalogs of scriptures by Shi Daoan and Zhu Shixing. Even earlier, during the Warring States period, in the seventh year of King Zhao of Yan, a Taoist named Shilu carried a staff and held a cake, able to produce a ten-story pagoda from his fingertip, as seen in Wang Jia's "Forgotten Records." Even earlier, during the Spring and Autumn period, the "Expanded Collection of Bright Expositions" quotes Liezi, "Confucius heard that there was an 'opposite' in the West?" However, Zong Bing's "Reply to He Chengtian's Letter" states, "Zhou and Confucius never spoke of the Buddha," and Mouzi's "Treatise on Resolving Doubts" states, "Yao, Shun, Zhou, and Confucius did not know of Buddhism." Why is this? The "Continuation of the Biographies of Eminent Monks" quotes the "Book of Zhou, Strange Records" mentioning "Su You, the Grand Historian of King Zhao, and Hu Duo, the Grand Historian of King Mu," placing it in the Western Zhou. The "Discussion on Clarifying Buddhism" states, "Boyi described going to the sea, to the country of India, Guo Pu annotated that this is where the Buddha arose, also like the Great Compassionate teachings of the Tathagata," indicating that during the era of the Great Yu, Buddhism already existed. According to calculations, this was more than 1,620 years before the birth of Shakyamuni.

### Comedian Lu Qiqi Attempts Suicide by Jumping from Building, Rescued and Slightly Injured, Caused by Nervous Breakdown from Quitting Opium

Lu Qiqi, a comedian from Suzhou, has long been addicted to opium, requiring a large monthly expenditure. Recently, due to the exorbitant price of opium and the decline in business, he found himself in dire straits. Recently, Lu's friends pooled a large sum of money and sent Lu to the Yongchuan Hospital on Route Macao Paulu in the French Concession to quit opium. He has been there for several days, and his progress has been good. However, yesterday morning around ten o'clock, Lu suddenly had a suicidal thought. Taking advantage of the nurses' inattention, he jumped from the window of his hospital room on the third floor. Fortunately, he was immediately discovered and rescued. He was only slightly injured and is currently still receiving treatment at the hospital. It is said that Lu's suicide was entirely caused by a nervous breakdown during the withdrawal period. It is said that abnormal behaviors caused by excessive nervous excitement are often heard during the withdrawal period, regardless of gender. In such cases, medical professionals must pay close attention.

### To the Interior via Guangzhouwan: Routes and Travel Expenses

— Shounan

Currently, there are only two relatively safe routes to the interior: one is via Guangzhouwan to Guangxi, and the other is via Rangoon and then the Burma Road to Yunnan. Traveling via Rangoon is more troublesome; not only does it take months to obtain a passport, but baggage checks there are also very strict. Therefore, traveling via Guangzhouwan is preferable.

Here is a report from several friends who have arrived in the interior. It details the travel expenses, routes, and schedules, and also clearly states the things to pay attention to along the way. The travel expenses are, of course, calculated using the most economical method. I think many readers want to go to the interior, so you can refer to this.

(1) Shanghai to Hong Kong: Taking a Taikoo or Jardine Matheson ship takes about three days and nights to reach Hong Kong. The cheapest ticket is 50 yuan in national currency, plus 10 yuan for tips (meals are provided on board). Upon arrival in Hong Kong, hand over your luggage to the China Travel Service (CTS) to be delivered to your hotel for 1.10 Hong Kong dollars per piece (this avoids inspection troubles). Assuming two pieces of luggage, and a five-day wait in Hong Kong for a ship, you can stay at the Datong Hotel (next to the Wing On Department Store on Des Voeux Road), with a minimum cost of 4 Hong Kong dollars per day for food and lodging.

(2) Hong Kong to Guangzhouwan: There is a Great Precious Stone ship plying this route. Hand over two pieces of luggage to CTS to be sent on board, costing 1.10 Hong Kong dollars per piece. Purchase a ship ticket from CTS, approximately 18 Hong Kong dollars—3rd class. It takes one day and night to reach the destination, with food and lodging provided on board.

(3) Guangzhouwan to Chikan: A car ride of about half an hour. It is necessary to hire a car together with several people, costing about 20 yuan in national currency per person including luggage (the following are all in national currency).

(4) Chikan to Yulin: A six-day journey by sedan chair, costing 250 yuan per person (one person per chair, luggage cannot be carried along, even small bags are not allowed by the porters). Luggage costs 0.80 yuan per catty, assuming 140 catties, the total is 112 yuan. Food and lodging for six days costs 60 yuan. The most important thing to note is that it is best to form a group, with the luggage chairs in front and the passenger chairs behind, so as to supervise them. It is also necessary to take turns paying attention at each lodging station, especially at the Shijiao lodging station, as the police force there is weaker and porters often steal luggage. The route is as follows: first day, Chikan to Zhuxi; second day, Zhuxi to Lianjiang; third day, Lianjiang to Shijiao; fourth day, Shijiao to Liangtian; fifth day, Liangtian to Luchuan; sixth day, Luchuan to Yulin.

(5) Yulin to Guixian: Hiring a car together with several people is the simplest and most cost-effective method, taking one day and costing about 80 yuan per person including luggage. If there is no car, you can take a three-wheeled pedicab, which takes two days and costs 30 yuan per vehicle. However, there are high slopes along the way, requiring you to get off and walk for one or two kilometers. Taking a sedan chair takes about three days and costs about 100 yuan.

(6) Guixian to Guiping: Take a small steamboat-towed barge, with a ticket price of 3.20 yuan plus 0.50 yuan for tips. At this time, you must have identification, otherwise purchasing tickets and inspections along the way will be troublesome, and there will be many obstacles.

(7) Guiping to Shilong: Take a small steamboat-towed barge, which takes two days to reach the destination, with a ticket price of 4.50 yuan plus 0.50 yuan for tips. The conditions on the boat are very poor. The West River is rapid and has many reefs. To avoid moving luggage, most people spend the night on the boat. There are no cabins on the barge. Food expenses from Guixian to Shilong are about 18 yuan.

(8) Shilong to Liuzhou: Take a bus from the Highway Bureau, with a ticket price of 20 yuan. However, passenger tickets are not easy to obtain and often require waiting for four or five days. Luggage under 20 kilograms is free of charge, and for each 10 kilograms exceeding this weight, the fee is 8 yuan. Assuming a five-day wait in Shilong for a bus, the cost of food and lodging is about 40 yuan.

(9) Liuzhou to Yishan: Take the Qian-Gui Railway, with a second-class ticket price of 6 yuan, which takes four hours. The cost of staying overnight in Yishan that day is about 6 yuan.

(10) Yishan to Guiyang: Take a highway bus for around 140 yuan, which takes three days to reach the destination. Luggage exceeding 20 kilograms requires a freight fee of about 40 yuan. If there is a freight truck available, it is cheaper. Food and lodging for three days costs 30 yuan.

(11) Guiyang to Kunming: Highway bus costs 127.50 yuan. The cost of exceeding the luggage allowance is about 60 yuan. However, the Highway Bureau's bus cannot transport luggage to Kunming at the same time, so it is best to find a ride on a truck. The journey takes three days. Those going to Chongqing can take a highway bus from Guiyang to Chongqing, which takes two and a half days, with a ticket price of 117.12 yuan.

Notes: (1) The entire journey takes at least 35 days and up to one and a half months. (2) Two pieces of luggage are the most convenient, weighing about 140 catties in total. (3) The total travel expenses are 1385.07 yuan in national currency, calculated using the most economical method. If you stay for an extra day along the way, it will cost an additional 10 yuan. Therefore, you need to bring 55 Hong Kong dollars and 1250 yuan in national currency for the entire journey. (4) Identification is needed for inspections along the way and must be issued by a bank. It is best to have proof from an agency in the interior, which is more convenient. (5) The currency commonly used in Guangxi is called Guizi, and one Guizi is equivalent to 0.50 yuan in legal currency. (6) It is best to travel with several people, not only for mutual care, but also because travel expenses can be shared, so one person should not start out rashly.

### Zhang Yuanji's Oil Painting Solo Exhibition Opens Today

The solo exhibition of oil paintings by the young painter Zhang Yuanji will open today (21st) at the Dasing Art Gallery. There are over 80 exhibits, all of which are oil paintings. The scenery of Guilin and Kunming is the most captivating. Mr. Zhang once painted a terraced field along the Southwest Highway, which shows the beautiful rivers and mountains of Free China. There are also individual works of human figures, still lifes, portraits, and compositions. The attached picture is one of Mr. Zhang's masterpieces, a large painting entitled "Exile," with somber colors, skillful brushstrokes, and excellent expressive power. Although the Dasing Art Gallery has continuous exhibitions, pure Western paintings are rare. This time, Mr. Zhang is holding a pure oil painting exhibition, which should attract Western art lovers.

### Executive Yuan Issues Measures for Child Care, Each County to Have at Least One Child Care Center

(Chongqing News) Children are the future masters of the country. The sound development of children's bodies and minds will ensure healthy citizens in the future. Since the war, due to the difficult living conditions of the people, parents' ability to raise their children has been affected, resulting in malnutrition and wandering children everywhere. There have also been cases of infanticide and selling children. Although the government has paid attention to promoting the establishment of child care centers and nurseries to provide some relief, it is not enough to solve this serious problem. The Executive Yuan has now distributed the "Measures to Solve the Problem of Child Care," as suggested by the actors graduating from the Mongolian Political Training Class, to the national health administration agencies for compliance. The measures are as follows:

(1) Each county should have at least one child care center, and more should be established in areas with larger populations. Their facilities should be well-equipped to ensure that children who have no parents or who have parents who are unable to raise them, or who are unable to take care of them in reality, can be fostered. (2) For families with more than three unmarried children and who are truly in financial difficulty, a certain amount of living allowance should be given for each additional child. (3) Primary and secondary schools and kindergartens should establish and enrich facilities related to the physical and mental well-being of students in accordance with a certain proportion, depending on the population and area of the locality. (4) Local health administrative agencies should send personnel to each family in their area in the near future to guide women on how to raise children, and to examine children's physical condition and indicate ways to correct their shortcomings.

Scholarship Lectures

### Research Methods in History (7)

— Xue Wujing

A. Thought: In Chinese history, the achievements of Chinese thought are expressed in three major currents. The first is the academic thought of the late Zhou period, an era of independence where politics and education were separate, and freedom of speech was extremely high. Many scholars, with compassionate hearts, spoke out to correct disorder and save the world. Although their ideas were diverse and their choices varied, they were like celestial horses soaring through the sky, unconstrained. Laozi and Zhuangzi emphasized naturalness and opposed ritualism. Confucius and Mencius valued benevolence, righteousness, and promoted ritual and music. Mozi advocated universal love and conformity. Han Fei promoted strict laws and severe punishments. Xu Xing advocated communal farming, Zou Yan discussed cosmology, and Gongsun Long explored the similarities and differences between "hard and white" and the "white horse is not a horse" argument. All of these had their own logic and reasons. No wonder people called this the Golden Age. The second current spans from the Han to the Song and Ming dynasties, a period of mixed Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist thought. After Buddhism was introduced to China, some people translated texts, while others traveled to India. Coupled with the people's aversion to chaos since the Northern and Southern Dynasties, various sects flourished. By the Song and Ming dynasties, the teachings of Zen Buddhism particularly suited the tastes of the literati. Neo-Confucian scholars were Confucian rather than Buddhist, rejecting Buddhism openly but embracing it secretly. We only need to look at the "Song Yuan Academic Cases" and "Ming Confucian Academic Cases," Zhou Dunyi's "Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate," the Cheng brothers' emphasis on reverence and the investigation of things, Zhang Zai's "Western Inscription" and "Correcting Ignorance," Zhu Xi's investigation of things to extend knowledge, Lu Xiangshan's emphasis on the unity of mind and principle, and Wang Yangming's unity of knowledge and action. This was a period of integration of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism. The third current extends from the late Ming dynasty to the Republic of China, a period of clashing Eastern and Western thoughts. Since the European Renaissance, there has been a shift from monarchical power to democracy, from spirituality to materialism, from superstition to science, from the individual to society, from heaven to earth, and from the future to the present. Consequently, thought has been liberated, and human rights have been greatly expanded. The influence of Europe and America has spread to China, shaking the social structure and fundamentally changing people's minds. However, they only recognize the material, not the spiritual; they only recognize rights, not justice; they only recognize evolution, not mutual aid; they only recognize war, not peace; they only recognize movement, not stillness. The East and West each have their own strengths and weaknesses. In the future, these two currents of thought will move from conflict to harmony, and a new era of civilization will surely emerge. These are all things that those who study history cannot ignore or neglect.

B. Economy: Since Marx's economic interpretation of history was published, humanity's eyes and ears have been refreshed. His main idea is that social change is history. In other words, looking at humanity horizontally yields society, and looking at it vertically yields history. The foundation of society is its economic structure, which he calls the material. The upper layer of society consists of law, politics, religion, ethics, philosophy, art, etc., which he calls ideological forms. When the foundation changes, the upper layer also changes accordingly. He overturned the previous historians' tendency to explain social change solely from the upper layer of society, neglecting the foundation. With this theory, history became a living and progressive discipline. Thus, the evolutionary view of history corrected the heroic view of history, the economic view of history corrected the political view of history, and the scientific view of history corrected the theological view of history, which determined the value of history in the realm of science. Based on this theory, when we observe the past history of our country, various ethnic wars in history are nothing more than attempts to seize natural resources to satisfy the desire for survival. For example, the disturbances of Huang Chao, the rebellions of Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng, and the uprisings of Hong Xiuquan and Yang Xiuqing all fall into this category. Guan Zhong said, "When the granaries are full, people will know etiquette." Mencius said, "Only those with constant property have constant minds." Confucius said, "Do not worry about scarcity, but worry about inequality." Furthermore, Sun Yat-sen's equal land ownership and regulation of capital are all aimed at solving economic problems. This is the fundamental concept of modern historical research.

### Improvement of China's Wartime Financial and Economic Policies (Continued)

— Xia Yande

Food Policy

In wartime economic policy, sufficient food and sufficient troops are equally important. The adequacy of food is indeed of great importance in supporting the war effort and stabilizing people's livelihoods. During the last European war, Britain and Germany fought each other. They paid attention to using submarine policies to blockade each other's food supply, cutting off the enemy's lifeline. Germany later failed because of the lack of food, which led to the disintegration of morale and the shaking of popular sentiment. In this second war between Britain and Germany, Germany's attack on Britain still focused on intercepting the transport of food and other materials at sea. After the outbreak of the war, the food problem in Europe became extremely serious. In addition to doing their best to maintain supplies, the belligerent countries have long implemented controls internally; such as Germany's rationing of food based on population, Britain's restrictions on consumption, and other countries have also adopted effective measures.

China's food supply can generally be self-sufficient in peacetime. In the three years after the war, the provinces had successive bumper harvests, and there was no food problem. The principle of free market trading was still maintained, and no strict controls were imposed. Although the government promulgated the "Wartime Food Management Regulations" in August of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), making preliminary controls, it did not have a significant effect. As a result, in the fourth year of the war, rice prices soared in various places, and all things became expensive, and the livelihoods of ordinary people were panicked, forming a serious social problem.

The reason for this soaring rice price is not due to the sudden increase in the issuance of legal tender, nor is it due to the lack of supply. According to the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute’s report: The production of rice last year was similar to that of the previous year. Although some provinces decreased slightly, some provinces increased, and the total number was not much different. Even if there is a slight shortage, the past stocks are sufficient to cope with the surplus. The recent rise in rice prices is not the result of natural shortages, but is caused by artificial inflation. A small number of dignitaries and wealthy businessmen hoard and hoard goods, and landlords and wealthy farmers wait for high prices to sell. The inventory cannot be turned into supply for a while, and middle- and upper-class families worry that the price of rice will continue to rise and the supply of rice will be insufficient, so they rush to buy and stockpile it. The market demand exceeds the consumption needs, and supply and demand go in opposite directions, and finally lead to today’s rice prices. peak. This kind of unreasonable surge is caused by manpower, and it should be suppressed by political power.

Over the past year, the government has repeatedly changed its food policy in view of this situation. In principle, it was decided to implement management to maintain food for the people and to replenish military rations. In the Executive Yuan, a National Food Administration was specially set up. It has now expanded its scope and changed to the Ministry of Food. Below it, the province has a Food Administration, and the county and city have a Food Management Committee, which is responsible for management at all levels. Hoarding and hoarding will be severely cracked down. If officials are found to be hoarding, they will be sentenced to death in order to achieve the effect of punishing one to warn a hundred. The price of food is determined by the price evaluation committee of each province. Imports of rice are encouraged, while exports are prohibited. Now that the field tax has been changed to the collection of real objects, it can also accumulate noodles and food to stabilize rice prices. In addition, grain coupons are issued to purchase food, and public sales are also being implemented in the initial stage. Some provinces have also implemented special measures: such as Hunan’s grain donation, Fujian’s public sale, Chongqing’s grain storage registration in Sichuan, and Jinhua’s rationing of food in Zhejiang.

Some government officials advocate that the government should not only manage food, but also further implement state-owned food, and that all food in the country, except for the part necessary for farmers, should be publicly bought and sold by the state. This proposal is naturally a thorough and revolutionary policy, which can immediately solve the problem of unequal distribution; however, the biggest abuse can easily reduce production. In the past, the Soviet Union suffered famine as a result, and tens of thousands of people starved to death. Therefore, I believe that we should still adopt a steady approach: on the one hand, encourage food production, on the other hand, prohibit food waste, and use parity purchase and sale or price limit to prevent food production from decreasing and obtain fair prices and reasonable distribution.

Land Policy

The declaration of the Financial Conference stated that food policy and land policy are the two major policies of the Principle of People's Livelihood and should be implemented at the same time. The current food policy is only a palliative measure, and the fundamental solution must be to implement the land policy. Seeing its intention, it is believed that food is only a product of land production, and leveling the prices of land production is only to reduce land income. If the land system is further reformed, the land itself has been fairly distributed, and this kind of income will have no way to generate it at all. Mr. Zhongshan advocated equal land rights to equalize the distribution of social wealth and eliminate unearned profits; its implementation methods can be divided into several points: (1) taxation according to price, (2) purchase according to price, (3) price increase for public ownership, (4) farmers have their land, and the last point is especially emphasized. Later, the land law formulated by the National Government has more detailed regulations on the implementation of various aspects. Now the authorities have stated that they want to promote the policy of equal land rights, but they have not put forward any new methods. It is probably prepared to implement it in accordance with the current guidelines of the Principle of People's Livelihood and the Land Law.

Some government officials said that equal land rights is the policy of state-owned land, and land should be gradually nationalized, and the state should become a major landlord; and advocated learning from the Soviet Union's example and achieving this goal in a revolutionary way. However, I don't think so. Mr. Zhongshan's policy does not want to nationalize the land. Except for the land that can be bought and publicly owned for public needs, most of it is still owned by the people. His method can be said to be a land-farmer-owned policy. Although public land ownership is the ultimate ideal, the current implementation only needs to popularize the land, that is, to implement the policy that farmers have their own land. Since the state does not want to be a major landlord, the method of uncompensated confiscation does not need to be adopted.

Recently, the Farmers Bank of China has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to set up a land finance department with a capital of 50 million yuan to provide long-term agricultural credit loans and is allowed to issue land bonds. It is known that the loans are divided into the following types: (1) Land purchase loan based on price, (2) Land micro-use loan, (3) Land improvement loan, (4) Land replanning loan, (5) Self-cultivation farmer assistance loan, (6) Land registration consolidation loan. Among them, items 4 and 6 help the government to consolidate land, items 1 and 2 help the government to purchase land, and items 5 and 3 help farmers to purchase and benefit from land use. The overall intention should be to use the issued land bonds to lend to poor farmers and tenants to purchase cultivated land from landlords in order to achieve the goal of farmers owning their own land. However, this work is very difficult and cannot be undertaken by the meager resources of the Farmers Bank alone. Moreover, if the landlords are unwilling to sell their land, how will the government deal with it? This is a major reform in internal affairs. In today's extremely serious foreign troubles, I am afraid it is not an appropriate time to implement it.

Conclusion

Looking at the resolutions of the Fifth National Congress of the Eighth Central Committee and the Three Financial Conferences: the fiscal policy is to balance national income and expenditure and equalize the burden of the people; the food policy is to suppress hoarding and speculation and maintain military rations and people's food; the land policy is to realize equal land rights and enable farmers to have their own land. Among them, the land policy only expresses a point of intention, the food policy is also mostly in principle, and several more concrete methods have been put forward for the fiscal policy. In addition to eliminating long-standing malpractices in a negative way, it also builds a sound financial system in a positive way; compared with the abolition of Likin and tariff autonomy set by the First Financial Conference, and the reform of land tax and the abolition of corvee set by the Second Financial Conference, the scope is wider and the significance is more significant. In particular, the equalization of the national burden is something we are happy to hear.

In the past, the wartime finances handled by the government have done a great job in raising war funds; the supply has been constant for several years and has not hindered the progress of the war. However, the war expenses are not very fair to bear, and this point has been frankly admitted by the highest military authorities. Although the government did not issue much additional currency in the first two years of the war, it did not come up with effective ways to absorb it into production and construction, which led to rising prices. Rising prices, on the one hand, increased the need and supply of currency, and on the other hand, enabled floating capital to have the opportunity to speculate and profit in the market. The higher the price, the more legal tender is issued, the thicker the speculative profit, and the price continues to rise as a result. Such repeated cycles make the rich become extremely rich, the poor become extremely poor, and the middle class also fall into poverty. Today, labor income is really too low; look at how many civil servants, intellectuals and civilians have made great contributions to the country during the war, but their lives are extremely difficult. On the other hand, property income is too high, and a small number of wealthy speculators have gained benefits that they never dreamed of in peacetime. Such a phenomenon cannot be seen in European and Western belligerent countries. For example, Germany immediately raised 40% of private capital when the war broke out, and the maximum operating profit could not exceed 5%, so there was no possibility of making huge profits at all. After the war, Britain also levied taxes on national foreign exchange holdings, and the wartime profit tax rate was raised to 100% at most. The government is now re-emphasizing the use of tax policies to raise war funds, and the above-mentioned phenomena must be corrected so that the war expenses are borne by those with greater ability.

Today, China is at a critical juncture. In addition to doing everything possible to save the country's survival, we must also consider the long-term plan for future construction. War can change a country's economy: it can lead the country to the road of capitalism, or it can gradually lead to the road of people's livelihood or socialism. Our current financial and economic policies must not only adapt to the huge needs of wartime, but also conform to the principles of national economy and social justice. The government should exercise its power to make the rich pay and maintain the necessary lives of the common people. In a long-term war, the nation and the people's livelihood must be considered together. The important measures of this conference are not much different from these principles. The actual effectiveness depends on how it is implemented in the future. Now the people should abide by the principle of "those who have money pay, and those who have strength contribute", and the officials must also adhere to the spirit of "civil officials do not want money, and military officials are not afraid of death", so that the future of the country will be promising.

### On National Defense and Agricultural-Industrial Construction

— Chen Hezhang

I. The Importance of National Defense Construction

Experience tells us that war is an indelible part of human nature. Looking at the wars recorded in history, there have been countless instances. Analyzing these wars, it can be said that war is an indispensable element for national survival. "The superior wins and the inferior is deceived; the strong eat the weak" is the principle of natural selection. The so-called "survival of the fittest" applies not only to the natural world but also to human society; it applies not only to individuals but also to nations. (Note 1) The superiority or inferiority of national competition depends entirely on the strength or weakness of national power. This national defense refers not only to the strength of military equipment but also to the power of thought, and especially to the great power of economics, in short, national defense economic power.

After the Northern Expedition, the Chinese Nationalist Party formulated the "Outline for Resistance and Reconstruction," among which the first economic outline stated: "Economic construction should be centered on military affairs, while also paying attention to improving people's lives." The phrase "centered on military affairs" essentially means "centered on national defense." The purpose of national defense economic construction is not merely to expand military equipment unilaterally. It should be known that the other wing of national defense is an economic power that cannot be ignored. There are many forms of warfare, and the most severe and vicious of these is economic warfare. (Note 2) In order to accomplish this mission of resistance and reconstruction, China has long decided to establish a self-sufficient and self-reliant national defense economy.

How is national defense economic power cultivated? Examining emerging countries, they all prioritize the cultivation of heavy industry and industries that meet industrial needs. From Peter the Great in Russia to the Five-Year Plans of the Soviet Union and the Four-Year Plan of Germany, all have focused on national defense considerations to cultivate national defense economic power. What about China? Heavy industry? Heavy agriculture? Or a balance of agriculture and industry? This is the theme that this article will discuss.

II. The Characteristics and Great Achievements of Agricultural-Industrial Construction

Whether China should be an agricultural country or an industrial country is a problem that must be solved in the process of resistance and reconstruction. Based on China's basic needs and the past experiences of other countries, most experts believe that national economic construction can only be promoted through industrialization. However, more than 75% of China's population is engaged in agriculture, agricultural income accounts for 80% of the national income, and agricultural exports account for about 70% of the total export value. The importance of agriculture in China's economy is evident. From this perspective, how can we abandon agriculture and replace it with industry? Therefore, what China needs is to use industry to promote agriculture, and to establish industry through agriculture, just like the United States and the Soviet Union, in the process of highly industrialized development, agricultural production is not neglected. In other words, China needs to "emphasize industry" without "abandoning agriculture"; but it does not advocate the equal development of industry and agriculture, but only strives for its balanced development. The so-called balanced development means that in the process of industrial development, attention is paid to the development and utilization of agricultural resources, and the goals of agricultural improvement and promotion still take into account how to promote industrial production. Generally speaking, it is agricultural industrialization. As for why China needs agricultural industrialization, the length of this article does not allow it. However, in general, agricultural industrialization, from the standpoint of the rural economy, is to develop various inherent handicrafts in rural areas, and to increase the income of agricultural management through the improvement of tools, technology, and organizational methods. Its production method may be the processing of self-produced raw materials, or the processing of purchased raw materials or semi-finished products. From the standpoint of the industrial economy, agricultural industrialization is also the only way for new-style industries to decentralize to agriculture, using industrial capital to shift to the surplus labor and low labor costs and raw materials in rural areas, in order to reduce production costs. (Note 3) Therefore, it can be said that China needs to attach equal importance to agriculture and industry.

In terms of enterprise, after China went to war, national defense economic construction was determined to focus on both agriculture and industry. Regarding this point, Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao clearly stated in his article "Economic Construction Policy": "Today, the purpose of my country's economic construction is two-fold: (1) to build for national defense; (2) to build for people's livelihood. Therefore, we plan to adhere to two major policies: one is to promote both industry and mining, and the other is to attach equal importance to agriculture and industry. Its specific goals can be listed in four aspects: (1) to establish a national defense basic industry, promote the development of mining, the supply of electricity, and lay the foundation for general industry; (2) to promote agricultural improvement and the use of scientific methods, in order to increase production and improve farmers' livelihoods; (3) to use domestic raw materials, improve industrial, agricultural, and mining production technology, in order to reduce costs, expand sales, and gradually achieve self-sufficiency in food, fuel, and other necessities; (4) to improve the organization of the rural economy and industrial and commercial groups, so that they can help each other and use them flexibly." From this passage, it is not difficult to see that China's national defense economic construction policy has indeed paid attention to all aspects of agriculture and industry. It should be noted here that the agriculture and industry referred to in this article are agriculture and industry in a broad sense. The former includes forestry, and the latter includes mining. From this, it can be inferred that China's national defense economic power actually includes agriculture, forestry, industry, and mining. Therefore, the cultivation of China's national defense economic power lies in rational construction of agriculture and industry based on actual needs. The so-called rationalization of construction refers to the balanced development of agriculture and industry, without overemphasizing either; all construction should meet the requirements of national defense, because construction without national defense is no different from no construction.

Since the war, four years have passed. If we review the agricultural-industrial construction, we are glad that we have been proceeding along a rationalized path, and its great achievements are indeed worth mentioning. The progress can be seen from what Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao said: "Before the war, my country had very few national defense heavy industries. Although the government tried its best to plan and prepare, most of them had not yet started production. Today, my country's national defense heavy industries, steel, machinery, electrical appliances, chemicals, and mining departments, both state-owned and private, are advancing simultaneously, and all have products. Although there is still a considerable distance from self-sufficiency; but it has built a broad foundation for national defense industrial self-reliance. Before the war, my country's rural areas were extremely dilapidated, especially in the southwestern and northwestern provinces. Today, in my southwestern and northwestern provinces, due to the financing of agricultural finance, the construction of farmland water conservancy, the promotion of agricultural cooperation, the improvement of agricultural technology, and the export of cash crops, there has indeed been great progress."

The purpose of agricultural industrialization is to promote the national people's self-sufficiency in food and clothing, and also to promote the large-scale export of agricultural products. China's food was originally self-sufficient. Since the war, there have been bumper harvests year after year, and there should be no difficulty in food supply and demand; however, due to traffic obstacles and inconvenient transportation, private hoarding has gradually increased, stimulating rising food prices, which is undeniable. The authorities are taking effective control measures in this regard, and this local phenomenon should not be difficult to solve. As for the matter of self-sufficiency in clothing, as far as the whole country is concerned, the supply of cotton clothing is no longer a problem. The national cotton production reached more than 12 million dans in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), and cotton used to be an import surplus, but in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), it had become an export surplus. Unfortunately, the expansion of the war zone has inevitably been greatly affected. Therefore, the government has increased the planting of high-quality cotton in Sichuan, Yunnan, and other provinces, and has also worked hard to transport the surplus cotton from western Hubei and Shaanxi to the southwest. As of the end of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), there were 12 textile factories relocated inland. According to reports, by the end of June this year (1941), the newly added factories and textile factories could reach 400, so they are sufficient to supply the needs of a large number of troops and the majority of the people in the rear. As for other agricultural products such as tung oil, tea, and hog bristles, under the government's unified sales and encouragement, the export volume is very considerable, and it has made a great contribution to increasing the source of foreign exchange.

As for the industry itself, the total amount of industrial investment in Free China has reached 150,000 million yuan, and the total output value of various factories in the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940) was 340,000 million yuan, which is a sharp increase of one and a half times compared with the 140,000 million yuan in the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939); and 11 centers of light and heavy industries have also been formed in the southwest and northwest. The total number of new-style factories has reached 1,400, and even gasoline and alcohol, which had almost no output before the war, can now produce 400,000 to 500,000 gallons per month. Such achievements, even if exhausted by ten thousand words, cannot express one ten-thousandth of them.

III. Prospects for Agricultural-Industrial Construction

In summary, the operation of new-style industries is growing, and the work of agricultural innovation has begun to dawn. This has indeed established a broad foundation for national defense construction. In the future, in order to take a step further and complete the great cause of national construction, we must strive for the balanced development of agriculture and industry, and more importantly, adopt a perfect economic system.

China's economic system will undoubtedly adopt an economic system centered on the Principle of People's Livelihood as the construction center. Regarding this point, Mr. Wei Tingsheng made a thorough explanation in his article "Ten Policies for Economic Construction in the Southwest," which is quoted as follows: "My country's economic construction should be based on the Principle of People's Livelihood and achieve the goal of people's enjoyment. The Principle of People's Livelihood combines the strengths of both capitalism and communism, so that the benefits of social production are enjoyed by all the people, and its business is not manipulated by special elements, and its benefits are not monopolized by the capitalist class. On the one hand, the state directly operates production enterprises in a commercial manner, and on the other hand, the state guides small-scale private enterprises, forming a link in social production, that is, on the one hand, developing state capital, and on the other hand, controlling private capital, striving for increased production in production, and striving for rational distribution in distribution. The socialization of distribution under the Principle of People's Livelihood is to solve the problems of production and distribution at the same time in a gradual manner." (Note 4) In fact, the Chinese government's economic construction plan is to follow Sun Yat-sen's legacy that heavy industry and national defense industry should be state-owned in principle, and light industry should be government-encouraged and privately-operated in principle. Please observe that domestic transportation has long been nationalized, and larger mining areas, especially mining areas for national defense industry and heavy industry, have also been designated as state-owned mining areas. As for private enterprises, the government authorities are also making every effort to promote them, in order to cooperate and advance together. For example, the government has formulated laws and measures for the encouragement of private enterprises and government-business cooperation. As for agriculture, the recent Third National Financial Conference resolved to implement food policies and land policies, with the aim of solving military rations and people's food, and equalizing land rights, in order to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood. From the above, it can be seen that the government authorities have adopted an economic system of the Principle of People's Livelihood and are moving towards the road of rationalization. Looking forward to the future, we feel infinite excitement and gratification!

However, the smooth completion of national defense agricultural-industrial construction still depends on our greatest efforts. As mentioned earlier, war is an indelible part of human nature. Therefore, only when the survival of the entire nation is secured by "national defense" can the individuals in the collective have "enjoyment." Therefore, in the construction of the country today, we have to put "national defense" first and "enjoyment" second.

### Sugar Cane and Cane Sugar (4)

— Gao Jiannong

Now, let's briefly describe the process of spreading this precious plant, sugarcane, to all parts of the world. By 1420 AD, Prince Henry, the famous Portuguese prince who encouraged the search for new sea routes, had already cultivated sugarcane in the newly discovered Canary Islands and Madeira Islands - all in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean off Africa. When Columbus made his second exploration of the New World in 1494 AD, he also spread sugarcane to Haiti in the West Indies; from there, it was first widely spread to Cuba, and then invaded Brazil in the early 16th century, entered Mexico around 1520, and then spread to various parts of the Americas. Especially Santo Domingo on the island of Haiti, sugarcane was introduced and soon by 1515, it was able to produce cane sugar in large quantities in an orderly manner. It has since maintained its top position, with the title of "Sugar Island": for example, in 1789, at the beginning of the French Revolution, it had 723 sugar factories with an annual sugar production of 100 million kilograms! However, two years later, it also experienced a violent revolution, and the entire island's sugar industry was completely destroyed, so it had to transfer its leading position to the neighboring island of Cuba. Now, Cuba produces 2.1 million tons of sugar annually. Although it ranks second to India in terms of quota, it can control the world's cane sugar market. In short, within less than 100 years after the introduction of sugarcane to the New World, the export of cane sugar has occupied the most important position in goods; and the quality is good, and the price is cheap, far better than the sugar made by Europeans; therefore, the sales are naturally increasingly broad, and like mercury spilling on the ground, it has penetrated into all areas of the world. As for the spread of sugarcane to Natal in South Africa and New South Wales in Australia, it was in 1852; and since the East Indian islands such as Java and Sumatra are only separated from India by a body of water, when was sugarcane introduced? We cannot answer this question, just as we cannot answer when Indians began to plant sugarcane. - In summary: After the discovery of the New World, how many precious and beneficial plants were given to the Old World; now we have the Old World's sugarcane - and of course coffee - as our "reciprocity," which is also considered to have fulfilled the human sentiment of "reciprocity."

### US Cotton Soars More Than Fifty Points

The New York cotton market is active and strong, due to mass purchases, Washington political news is favorable to bulls, raising cotton cloth price limits, and poor weather reports, the rise is quite strong, and the closing result is a sharp rise of 51 to 56 points compared to the previous day's price.

Also, from August 1 last year to July 18 this year, US cotton statistics are recorded on the left (500 pounds per bale)

The Bombay cotton market initially fell due to sales by European exporters, but rebounded due to short covering. The closing result was an increase of one and a half to four and three-quarters of a rupee compared to the previous day's price.

Also, the forecast price for the opening today is expected to be eight rupees higher.

### Gardenia Slightly Falls

Recently, no new shipments of small gardenia have arrived from the Jiangbang area. A small number of shipments have been handled in the frozen water area, and dozens of pieces have been shipped from Shantou, because the cost is more suitable, so the asking price has also loosened by 20 to 30 yuan, but the inventory is fundamentally weak, and the market is expected to stabilize.

### The Price of Beauty Cigarettes Also Rises

The buying price of cigarettes is still rising, because the factory's shipments are very scarce, and the recent customer sales have become more prosperous, and the big merchants are still holding on and refusing to sell, and the current stock of chips on the market feels scarce, resulting in the price rising sharply. Yesterday, the price of Great Britain brand was 1,667 yuan per box, Old Knife brand was 1,195 yuan, and Pin Hai brand was 1,175 yuan, all 50 yuan higher than before, Wu Hua brand was 795 yuan, and Little Fairy brand was 830 yuan, also slightly higher. The market sales price of Beauty brand of Hua Cheng Company rose, and the new price for 10-pack is 1,500 yuan, and the 50-pack canned is 1,700 yuan.

### The Actual Sales of White Lead Sheet Are Difficult to Expand, the Standard Price is Still Firm

The market condition of white lead sheet in this city has been difficult to see a boom since the relocation of the battery factory, and the acceptance of Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao gangs has also been closed. Although there are some buyers and sellers, the number is very small, resulting in a sluggish market and difficult actual sales. Currently, only printing factories, type rooms, and tea houses in this street are responding to the market, and there are not many transactions. However, the colleagues who hold the goods are quite firm in their thinking. The reason is that the supply of goods from overseas has long ceased, and the buying and selling in this port is only based on the old inventory. The inventory is getting thinner day by day, and people's hearts are rising. Therefore, the market price is high. Yesterday, such as No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4, because the elimination was very small, the standard was slightly lower, selling for 4,000 yuan per barrel. No. 8, No. 10, and No. 12 were very popular among printing factories, and the market was very high, selling for about 5,200 yuan.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### Save on Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Expenses to Support the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Movement!

— Bai Zheng

Living in this turbulent era, the cost of clothing, food, housing, and transportation accounts for a very important page in our economy. Even if prices soar, we cannot but live. In order to live, we have to be slaves to clothing, food, housing, and transportation. If we calculate the daily expenses of every middle-class family on the isolated island, it is really amazing; so that the parents are running around all day for this clothing, food, housing, and transportation, in order to seek a minimum standard of living. However, there are many wealthy classes on the isolated island, and the price increase of everything seems to have nothing to do with them. They still wear silk and satin, delicacies, new-style foreign houses, and modern cars. It is not surprising that they spend nearly 1,000 yuan a month on transportation alone, but on the poverty-stricken side, even a large cake cannot be solved, which is also common on the isolated island. It is the same person, one in heaven, one in hell, and there is a world of difference. Therefore, due to the large number of poor people, various charitable organizations have emerged, relying on the support of people from all walks of life, but these charitable organizations are mostly about material relief, and there are indeed many young people on the isolated island who are aspiring to study, but they have no material assistance, and are stunned by the schools that require money for everything; moreover, they are still afraid of their material food, and a wave of desire for knowledge hits their hearts, which seems to be more serious than material food. Even if they have the determination to seek knowledge, they have no monetary relief, which leads to dropping out of school, unemployment, and falling into ruin. However, people are sympathetic and will never turn a blind eye. Why not help them?

Young people are the lifeblood of the country and the masters of the future. I think every reader of this publication is already familiar with this. Why not give them a helping hand? It is easy to save some money in the daily expense items. Think about which of the four items of clothing, food, housing, and transportation cannot be saved a little? Even if it is only one or two points, for example, in the clothing item, if you want to cut cloth for one yuan a foot, you might as well cut about nine corners a foot. Although the price difference is one or two points, the difference in the quality of the cloth is not too big. It is the same to wear, and the money is saved. In the food item, if you want to buy small dishes for one yuan, you can save one corner of money and change to buying dishes for one yuan and nine corners. If you can save one corner a day, you can save one yuan in ten days. Moreover, eating one corner less of dishes will not cause any nutritional deficiencies. In the housing item, going to bed earlier every day can save some electricity costs, and you can save several yuan a month. On the one hand, you can develop a good habit of going to bed early and getting up early, which can promote physical health. In the transportation item, walking more and taking the bus less every day can save bus money. In short, saving one or two corners in daily expenses is really an effortless thing. However, the author is not promoting saving to the point where you don't even eat, but saving some unnecessary expenses within the possible range. On the one hand, you can develop thrifty habits, and on the other hand, you can cherish material resources; and what is even more commendable is to donate the money saved from clothing, food, housing, and transportation to hard-working young people and cultivate useful talents for the country! It is also to save some vitality for the nation; how great is this achievement! Therefore, please everyone promote saving daily expenses and respond to the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Movement! That is not only the good fortune of hard-working young people! It is the good fortune of society! It is also the good fortune of the country! It is even more the good fortune of the nation! May everyone work hard!

### Clothes Talk

— Li Yi

The British government Monopoly Bureau has long issued a monopoly license for using bamboo as a raw material for clothing. It is used for the same purpose as hemp and cotton. The manufacturing method is to first soak the bamboo in a chemical solution for several days until the fibers are completely separated, then take it out and dry it, and it can be woven into clothing. The cost is very low, and bamboo grows very densely in tropical regions, so there is no shortage of raw materials.

Mrs. De Ye, a female scientist in Massachusetts, USA, has invented a type of clothing paper, called Sona in English. It is said that this paper is smooth and soft, like soft leather, does not get wet in water, does not get hot in fire, can be washed, can be ironed, and can be dyed in various colors, which will not change for a long time. The characteristic of this paper is that it not only has the same function as cloth, but also can be used more flexibly than cloth.

A certain part of the Mediterranean Sea produces a type of shellfish, whose shell is about three inches wide and about seven inches long. Each shell contains a very delicate bunch of silk, mixed with other marine plants, and submerged in mud. After washing and combing, it is golden and brilliant in color, no different from real silk. The silk maker must have experience, and after weaving, it can be used to make silk scarves, ties, gloves, scarves, and the like.

Los Angeles in the United States is a district where actresses gather, and the styles of clothing compete for novelty and are endless. Famous actresses often go to Paris to purchase new clothes, but since the principle of electric wire photography has been used, the new styles are transmitted from Paris to Los Angeles through submarine telegraphy. The weaving machines are already prepared, and as soon as the styles arrive, they start weaving in the same way. After 24 hours, they can appear on the market. From then on, women do not have to travel far across the ocean! (Note: This was the situation before the war).

According to the research results of many scientists appointed by the University of Agricultural Science in the province of Los Angeles, the degree of protection of various fabrics on the skin is that animal fibers can absorb more sunlight than plant fibers. Wearing hemp fabrics in the summer, the skin will be burned and turn black after one and a half hours. Cotton fabrics require two hours, wool fabrics require seven hours, and silk fabrics require ten hours. According to this, the protection of silk fabrics on the skin is better than all other fabrics.

There is a lace tree in Central America. The inner layer of its bark is colorful and orderly, even if it is a delicate weaver, it is not possible. About 300 years ago, on the birthday of the Spanish king, his subjects living in Mexico presented a collar made of lace tree, which was all natural except for cutting and polishing.

### Madam Fish in Henan

— Wei Jingchun

Having read Mr. Chen Nianyun's article "Madam Fish" in a previous issue of this publication, its specialized leisure is indeed admirable, a delightful food tale. However, the location mentioned is erroneous, so I offer this supplementary account, not to find fault, but to correct it.

According to what I know, "Madam Fish," commonly known as "Gold and Silver Phoenix Fish," has long been famous in Bianliang. The name itself suggests that it is no ordinary dish, hence one of the most renowned local delicacies. Indeed, carp can be found everywhere, but none compare to the Yellow River carp of Kaifeng, which are remarkably large and incredibly delicious. The seasoning and cooking methods are as previously described, but after washing the fish, everything inside the belly must be removed. When frying in oil, the heat should be low. After boiling, the wine and vinegar should be added generously, which will further enhance the flavor. Eating it creates a feeling of wanting to continue indefinitely. Therefore, the people of Bianliang often use it to treat esteemed guests. If this dish is absent, it is considered disrespectful. As a result, restaurants all try to offer it as a rare item, and the price is particularly high. When I was working in that area in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), I once purchased a fish for three strings of 800 cash coins to cook and eat. I felt that its taste was distinctly different from ordinary carp, resembling the taste of snake, but even more delicious. As for the name "Madam Fish," it was actually invented by the wife of the former chairman of Henan Province, Liu Zhi. (According to Mr. Chen's article, it was Hunan, which is likely a mistake for Henan.) The Liu family had lived in Bian for many years, and Mr. Liu had great respect for his wife. One day, Mr. Liu hosted a banquet for guests at the provincial office, including Secretary-General Fang Qidao, Finance Director Qi Zhenru, Construction Director Zhang Ruoyu, and administrative supervisors from various districts, all gathered together in a cheerful atmosphere. However, although all kinds of delicacies were prepared for the feast, only this "Gold and Silver Phoenix Fish" was missing. Mrs. Liu immediately ordered the cook to purchase it at a high price and personally cooked it to serve the guests. As a result, the name "Madam Fish" spread far and wide.

### Today's Housing

Zhu Ying

War indeed inflicts cruel suffering on humanity, but this suffering can stimulate long-numbed nations and remind them of the value of their existence. From this value, they learn to create civilization, where the glory of Caesar-style martial prowess is not a necessary form of happiness. The people of Shanghai, who were once fortunate, actually gained life experience for a time as the entire city became a war zone, a fiery hell. The sound of cannons roared, planes battled in the sky, and various colored meteors streaked across the night sky, which should have been enough to awaken them. However, there were still those who enjoyed the spectacle, widening their interested eyes to see where the fires were starting and where the buildings were collapsing, feeling both fear and pleasure!

Unfortunately, our troops fought hard for three months and then left, causing those who rejoiced in others' misfortunes to initially feel sadness, followed by terror, then confusion, and finally, feigning ignorance, they returned to "business as usual." On one hand, they indulge in pleasure as much as possible, and on the other hand, they speculate as much as possible! They have forgotten yesterday's bayonets, and they drink beer to celebrate the arrival of good fortune tomorrow. Mobile funds are piled up in the hands of speculators, and they will never automatically flow inland again! Because they are full of food and thinking about action, the practice of "hoarding and speculating" has affected every aspect of life: food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Which one has not increased in price? And which one is not competing with time, proportionally increasing in a straight line upwards? Rice and coal are soaring in price, transportation fares are repeatedly increasing, and cotton and woolen goods have increased by another 100%. No wonder the housing problem is becoming increasingly turbulent today.

Originally, after the war, the population decreased, and many houses were sealed off by the streets. As the occupied areas expanded, more and more people came here for refuge, creating a feeling that there were fewer houses than people. Those who came to seek refuge were mostly wealthy or moderately wealthy from various places, so it was not surprising that they were willing to pay high prices to purchase real estate. Judging from the situation of bank real estate mortgages for building houses and renting them out, which has not declined since 1939, it can be confirmed without a doubt. On the other hand, those who control real estate, jealous of the lucrative business of food, clothing, and transportation, also want to take the opportunity to squeeze profits, so they first increase rents for poor tenants, then issue eviction orders. Now, a new organization has emerged—a group responsible for evicting tenants! Because the administrative authorities turn a blind eye, they indirectly fuel the flames of the evil-doers' instigation, so that an old three-story building requires a monthly rent of more than one hundred yuan, and a key money of eight thousand five hundred; an office, only a little more than one square zhang in size, with a telephone, is said to require six or seven thousand yuan in key money, heavens! Who is really doing this? Who is really doing this!

My friend Mr. Huo Xueming, who teaches at Mingde Girls' High School, has been looking for a small house recently, but has had no success after several days of searching. Even if he wants to ask for advice, no one can give him any help. Therefore, I have a strange idea: Shanghai has many large mansions, and their young masters and misses, often for safety reasons, do not go to school, but hire tutors, and their houses are both empty and large. If Mr. Huo could be invited to live in their homes and pay rent as usual, and he could teach for two or three hours a day, wouldn't it be easier to make progress with such close instruction? Moreover, his wife, Ms. Zhao, is at the forefront of new literature, and has a foundation in English and mathematics! This proposal is certainly one-sided and ridiculous, but there may be opponents who fit this condition. If agreeable, please contact Mingde Girls' High School. However, this fact can reflect the current situation in Shanghai, which really does not allow a poet to have a foothold! Instead, red-bearded and green-eyed heroes have become the main characters of this era, performing scenes of self-proclaimed clever clowns!

However, the real feeling of life's suffering has a great price. Although we say that we are enduring the pain suffered for justice in this great era?

### A Week's Worth of Everyday Menu

— Hua Ying

Potatoes, commonly known as foreign yams, are also a good source of vitamins. Of course, they are indispensable in Western cuisine, where they often appear in three or four out of five or six dishes. Now, potatoes have also become quite expensive, so Western restaurants are saving where they can and not using them as liberally as before. In home cooking, potatoes are always used to accompany curry chicken, but recently, my family has been using them to make large meat patties. Because pork prices have soared, one yuan's worth of meat is not enough to make many meat patties. Peel and mash the potatoes, mix them with ground pork, and you can save half the pork. Make them into meat patties, and braise them together with a base of green vegetables, and the flavor is not bad. Besides this, you can also use them to make vegetarian meat patties. Just chop dried bean curd, shiitake mushrooms, etc. into small pieces, mix them with mashed potatoes, make them into patties, and braise them. The old ladies who eat vegetarian food will definitely welcome them.

Spring and Autumn

Just a Few Words

### How to Apply for Jiaotong University?

— Han

Just a modest attempt to show the way, nothing like a brick to knock on the door.

After the war, primary and secondary schools in Shanghai sprang up like mushrooms after rain, but universities and specialized schools mostly closed their doors, planning mergers or temporary suspensions. The surviving ones are mostly focused on arts and commerce, with very few in science and engineering. Jiaotong University, long regarded as the highest institution of learning in the Southeast and possessing a long history, will undoubtedly be the most ideal school in the minds of thousands of middle school graduates who aspire to study science and engineering. On the eve of the entrance examination, I, as an alumnus, would like to offer a word to the thousands of candidates. I will mainly discuss the nature of the test questions for each subject.

Classical and Profound Chinese

In the past, Chinese essay questions were mostly based on the Four Books and Five Classics. The meaning of the questions was profound, and those who did not read the classics would often be unable to understand the meaning of the questions and could not start writing. In recent years, there has been much criticism from various parties, so this antiquarian examiner has had to adapt to the situation. In addition to the original question, another question that is more modern and easier to understand has been added. Applicants can choose one of the two. However, you must understand that this does not mean that the examiner's literary style has changed. Candidates, if you are not preachers or lecturers, you must follow the wind.

English Emphasizing Structure

English also focuses on essay writing. There are several points to note. Simple words are better than cold words, and short sentences are better than long sentences. If you insert a passage that you think is good, but it destroys the grammar within the sentence, it is better to maintain the structure of the entire text. As for rhetorical devices, not much attention is paid to them. In middle school, you may have read the works of Shakespeare and Milton, but do not think that adding a few sentences to your essay will increase its merits when taking the entrance examination.

Physics: Sound, Light, Mechanics, and Electricity

In middle schools, both teachers and students tend to value mechanics and electricity while downplaying acoustics and optics. In practical applications and for the sake of allocating energy, we may have to make some distinctions, but from the perspective of coping with exams, this concept, especially in recent years, is unacceptable. In recent years, the number of physics exam questions has decreased compared to before the war, but ask yourself, which year does not include acoustics and optics? However, if candidates can read a common middle school chemistry book, such as the textbooks written by Blank and Conner or Smith, they can cope fairly well.

Mathematics Especially Emphasized

The mathematics subject includes algebra and analysis, mainly based on the Fan's version, but now it needs to be supplemented by Hall and Knight's Algebra to have more assurance. Analysis currently only tests plane geometry, removing solid geometry. Among them, the two sections on tangents and conic sections are the most important. For textbooks, you can choose to read either Liu Nai's or Smith and Gale's books. Others, such as Windsor's or Granville's analysis, are abbreviated and not detailed, which is still not enough to take the Jiaotong University entrance exam. There are fewer trigonometry questions. As for other subjects such as history, geography, and civics, there are no special features, so I will skip them.

This year, the departments of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and civil engineering each recruit forty people. There are usually slightly fewer applicants for civil engineering, so the chances of admission seem to be higher. After all, civil engineering is offered by more than just Jiaotong University. Those who are interested in this field can develop in many directions and do not have to be confined to one place.

Before this article ends, I must add one more sentence. You should strive for an average score in each subject, and you must not have a particularly poor score in one subject. Otherwise, if one subject is below twenty points, all your efforts will be in vain. There is no fixed standard for admission. The overall average of each subject is the criterion for selection, but it is also a fact that physics, chemistry, and mathematics are given slightly more weight. Therefore, candidates should not feel discouraged if they feel that they have performed poorly in the first day's exam and give up on the subsequent subjects. As long as you remain calm and give it your all, you will have a good chance of success.

### Autumn Sea Hall

11. Midnight Song

She asked so carefully, just short of asking Mei Bao to bring out her family's petty cash book for her to see.

"Fields...?" Mei Bao also never expected that she would relentlessly inquire about their roots, but of course, she couldn't reveal everything to her. "There are probably only about ten mu or so, and as for business matters, you see, my father never leaves the village, so what kind of business can he do? I remember when we first came here, there was some cash hidden in our boxes, but now it's almost all gone. As for our relatives, we have fewer than anyone else. Apart from my uncle in Li Village, I have never seen another one..."

"Then what about your maternal grandmother? Your maternal uncles?" The Meng family's daughter-in-law couldn't wait to interrupt and ask.

"There aren't any. Mom died very early... very early!" Having said this so often in recent years, if she suddenly changed it, the Meng family's daughter-in-law would probably be the first to feel surprised.

The listener frowned sympathetically.

"In that case, your family's situation is really quite difficult. Sister, I'm not saying this to upset you," saying this, she pulled the bamboo chair she was sitting on closer to Mei Bao, her face revealing an extremely secretive expression, as if the words she was about to say were related to the lives of everyone in the village. "Since your father doesn't have any money, why did you still go to school?" To be frank, in the mind of a rural woman like her, going to school is simply playing around. "For example, if you helped with some needlework at home, you could earn a few pennies. And..."

Before she could finish her words, Mei Bao shook her head.

"How much money can you earn that way? Good sister-in-law, you have to know that you can earn money by going to school as well. For example, you can become a teacher in the primary school here... "(163)

### These Years

— Xia Zi

Few cargo ships arrive. By the Huangpu River, only a group of naked children can be seen defecating, swimming, and bathing.

At the So-and-So Coal Company, coal dust is piled high in the square, above the bamboo fence, where grass has even grown. But the retail department has a porcelain sign that reads: "Retail Coal Balls, Limited to Two Jiao Per Person."

In the candy section of the movie theater, the boy in uniform stretches his head out at the entrance, waiting anxiously. In the foreign company, the ice cream delivery truck, the previous truck delivered two hundred dozen ice creams, all sold out during one break.

### Random Thoughts

— Wu Ziqing

Being beaten by the door man for going to the theater is "luck."

Being whipped for buying cheap rice is "poverty."

Parents being given the cold shoulder by their children is "fortune."

### Division of Labor and Cooperation in the Family

— Lu He

These past few days, the old maid has returned to her hometown for personal matters. Although my mother has repeatedly gone to the employment agency to hire one, she has never been satisfied with any of them. The reason is that during this rice planting season, most of the maids have to return to their hometowns to farm, and housewives are generally unwilling to easily dismiss the better workers. Therefore, most of those who are still lingering in the matchmaking shop are newcomers who are not used to working.

But the most important problem in life—food—cannot be skipped for a single meal, and the clothes that have turned oily black cannot be delayed any longer. Under such difficult circumstances, we specially held a tea party and elected my eldest brother as chairman. The result of the discussion was ten articles:

1. All attendees are members of the executive committee and have the obligation to supervise and encourage each other.

2. Assign the two sisters-in-law to be responsible for washing and cooking.

3. Stipulate that I and my fourth brother are jointly responsible for sweeping and cleaning.

4. My third brother is solely responsible for purchasing sundries and running errands.

5. As for the remaining five, seven, eight, nine, and three brothers, they will all be raised by the sixth brother and please mother.

6. When necessary, or if a person is unable to perform their duties, the other members of the committee may assist them. However, they must not use this as an excuse to shirk responsibility or engage in fraudulent activities such as laziness. Otherwise, once discovered, in addition to being fined a breakfast, they must also be fined one day's pocket money, which will be used as a reward for diligent workers.

7. Those with excellent performance will be awarded bonuses or prizes by the chairman to encourage them.

8. These rules have been approved by all the committee members, so once work is assigned, no objections may be raised. However, if necessary, they may be handled in accordance with Article 7.

9. These rules are subject to revision at any time and will take effect from the date of publication.

Truly, since the implementation of the family division of labor and cooperation, vivid and lively good phenomena have appeared everywhere. Even those who were unwilling to work in the past have cheered up and worked diligently, without relying on others. In this way, "not only can we develop the habit of self-reliance, but also save dozens of yuan a month in expenses. Thirdly, we can be particularly assured about the hygiene of our meals. Moreover, it is more clean and interesting than when we had a maid. I think that in these days of expensive rice and wages, this method can be adopted by general families.
