### U.S. Economic Blockade Policy Against Japan: Determined Not to Abandon Until Objectives Are Met; The U.S. Seeks No Peace; Democratic Fronts Mutually Trust Each Other; Wang Shijie Discusses U.S.-Japan Talks in America

Chongqing - Minister Wang Shijie of the Central Propaganda Department gave a speech at a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists on the afternoon of the 24th. The main points are as follows. Regarding the U.S.-Japan talks in the United States, Minister Wang first stated that the government of our country is continuously receiving reports. It can be said to you that the opinions of the ABCD countries are completely consistent, and there is full mutual trust between them. There is much speculation about the matters proposed by Japan to the United States. I am unable to elaborate on this at this time. However, one point is very clear: the Japanese have no real intention of abandoning any violence. They merely want to rely on a combined diplomatic and military offensive to get anti-aggression countries to relax their economic blockade. This attempt can be seen from the three principles announced by Tojo. The Japanese absolutely do not understand the psychology of the United States and other anti-aggression countries. The United States has no intention of seeking peace with Japan. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Australia have also guaranteed to the United States that if a conflict occurs between the United States and Japan, they are prepared to jointly fight against Japan. As for the U.S. economic blockade against Japan, it is a policy that the U.S. government and public have decided after a very long period of consideration. President Roosevelt had already hinted at it in his "quarantine speech" in Chicago four years ago. Later, Mr. Stimson made a more earnest proposal in a letter to the New York Times. Since this policy did not arise rashly, the U.S. government and public will certainly not abandon it before the objective of this policy is achieved. The remarks of U.S. Senator Campbell and other powerful congressional leaders can also serve as proof of the firmness of U.S. intentions. They all commented that if Japan wants to make peace with the United States, it must first withdraw from China. Senator Campbell even said that Japan must compensate China for its losses. This can be seen as another manifestation of the American sense of justice. Regarding the conflict on the Thai-Vietnamese border, there is little doubt that Japan is the mastermind behind it. It is generally believed that Vietnamese planes would not automatically invade the Thai border. But no matter what the background and motives of the Thai-Vietnamese conflict are, it is now very clear that Thailand's preparations to resist the Japanese army and our will to defend the Yunnan border are equally firm. However, we must pay attention to the fact that the Japanese army's various actions in expanding airfields in northern Vietnam are still proceeding fiercely. The true intention of the Japanese army seems to still be coveting our western border defense. Finally, regarding the situation of the National Political Council meeting, Minister Wang said that in the past week, the general assembly of the Political Council and the review meetings of various groups have been held continuously. Government ministers and chiefs have been subjected to various inquiries regarding the administrative situation in the past few months. The new food policy was particularly noticed by the councilors. The councilors initially had no objection in principle to the actual levy of field tax and the purchase of food, but they made many comments on the procedures implemented in various provinces. The food administration authorities are also happy to hear the details of these comments. Regarding the defense of the Yunnan-Burma Road, the councilors also expressed great concern and raised many inquiries. When answering these inquiries, the chairman of the government stated that the government has taken various measures for the defense of the road, and the results of our consultations with relevant countries are also good. Carefully examining the spirit manifested in this and previous sessions of the Political Council, I feel that the councilors can discuss various issues with an extremely calm attitude, without being hypocritical or perfunctory. This kind of spirit would not be ashamed to be placed in other advanced democratic countries. Therefore, our confidence in the future of China's democratic governance is also increasing day by day.

### National Political Council Holds Seventh General Assembly Yesterday, Passing Over Twenty Proposals; Continued to Hold Group Review Meetings This Morning

Chongqing - The National Political Council continued to hold group review meetings on the morning of the 24th to review proposals. All the proposals submitted by the councilors, the proposals submitted by the government for discussion, and the government reports have been reviewed. The seventh general assembly was held at 3:00 PM. The presidium members Zhang Boling, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Junmai, Wu Yifang, and 152 councilors including Lu Zongqi attended. Secretary-General Wang Shijie, Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin, and more than forty ministers and chiefs of various ministries, including Ju Zheng, Zhou Zhongyue, Guo Taiqi, Weng Wenhao, Xu Kan, Xu Shiying, and Jiang Tingfu, were present. Chairman Zhang Boling presided over the meeting. After the meeting began, the discussion of proposals began. A total of more than twenty proposals were passed, as well as the review and opinions of the government's foreign affairs, internal affairs, social, Mongolian-Tibetan, relief, and health departments. There were a large number of listeners and guests in the audience. Before 3:00 PM, the seats were already overcrowded. Those who arrived later had almost no seats to occupy. The atmosphere at the meeting was tense. This shows the government's and society's concern for the Political Council.

Also, Counselor Li Peiyan arrived on the 24th. As of the 24th, a total of 187 councilors had registered. The resolutions of the various cases are excerpted as follows: The proposal by Counselor Zhang Zhijiang and others requesting the government to actively promote national physical education, enhance the strength of resistance and construction, and establish the foundation of the nation for all ages was resolved to be sent to the government for adoption and implementation. The proposal by Counselor Mo Dehui and others to suggest changing the National Xikang Technical College into the National Xikang Agricultural and Industrial College was resolved to be sent to the government for prompt consideration and handling. The proposal by Counselor Ma Zongrong and others to prevent the occurrence of a "student shortage" in teacher education at all levels to benefit resistance and construction was resolved to be passed and sent to the government for earnest implementation. The proposal by Counselor Liu Hengjing and others requesting the government to increase the salaries of teachers was resolved to be amended and passed, and sent to the government with the request that the education budget for the next year should be increased as soon as possible, and the salaries of teachers and staff should be given preferential treatment to save the education crisis. It is also requested that the government issue a notice to local governments to implement the state's emphasis on education, and that local education funds, whether at the provincial or county level, should be given equal attention and efforts should be made to raise more funds.

The proposal by Counselor Ma Zongrong and others requesting the central government to earnestly increase national education funds to facilitate universal education was resolved to be amended and passed. It was found that the implementation of national education was a proposal submitted by the government for discussion, and the previous general assembly of this council expressed its approval. However, since its implementation, it has not been implemented according to plan, which is a pity. The government should be requested to earnestly implement it and increase funding to demonstrate credibility. The proposal by Counselor Ding Jishi and others requesting the government to allocate funds to build more civilian evacuation housing, repair suburban roads, and construct a bridge on the two rivers to facilitate transportation and evacuation was resolved to be sent to the government for adoption, planning, and implementation.

### Frequent Japanese Military Movements in Vietnam, Possible Invasion of Thailand; Japan Building New Airfields in Vietnam, Possibility of Attacking Yunnan Still Exists

Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman stated this afternoon in response to a reporter's question that the Japanese troops across the border in Vietnam are currently moving south quite frequently. This situation leads people to believe that Japan may invade Thailand. However, the possibility of the Japanese army attacking Yunnan still exists, because through the highways and railways across the border in Vietnam, the Japanese army's mobilization and transfer can be carried out quickly. Moreover, the Japanese air force base in Tonkin (northern Vietnam) is better equipped, larger, and more numerous than those in southern Vietnam. (24th Reuters dispatch)

Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission announced today that the Japanese army is building new airfields in northern Vietnam, expanding existing airfields, and increasing the equipment at various airfields in Vietnam. Most of the Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam have been transferred to the south, but this cannot be interpreted as Japan abandoning its plan to attack the Yunnan-Burma Road. With modern transportation, Japan can quickly transfer its troops back to northern Vietnam. (24th United Press dispatch)

Chongqing - Reliable sources here announced today that the Japanese army recently installed anti-aircraft guns around important cities and military airfields in Vietnam, preparing for any foreign air raids on Vietnam.

### Japan Holds Prefectural Governor Conference Yesterday; Tojo Delivers Speech Saying Japan is at a Crossroads of Life and Death

Reuters, Tokyo, 24th - Sixty Japanese prefectural governors held a temporary one-day meeting here today. Prime Minister Tojo, Minister of Finance Kaya, and other government leaders are expected to attend and deliver speeches. It has been announced that the prefectural governor conference aims to "continue to strengthen the national mobilization mechanism" and to ask the prefectural governors to "devote their efforts to cooperate in implementing the government's policy on the China incident." Subsequently, the Foreign Minister will report to the prefectural governors on the international situation, with special mention of the U.S.-Japan talks.

Reuters, Tokyo, 24th - Prime Minister Tojo addressed the Prefectural Governor Conference today, saying that the Japanese Empire is now at a crossroads of rise and fall.

He is deeply convinced that with a united and unified nation behind it, the government will be able to overcome all difficulties.

### After U.S. Military Decides to Withdraw, Prices in Tianjin Soar; Hoarders Still Refuse to Sell, Civilians Will Have Difficulty Surviving This Winter

Tianjin - Since the announcement of the withdrawal of the U.S. Marines, the prices of daily necessities here have soared. Flour is 28 Federal Reserve dollars per bag (about 60 National currency dollars), and hoarders still refuse to sell, so people expect that ordinary civilians will have difficulty surviving this winter. The British Municipal Council is currently trying to suppress the price of coal within the concession and has set retail prices, but many coal shops are moving their stocks outside the concession, where the price is about five times higher than in the British Concession, and buyers are still rushing to buy. However, the Kai Ping Coal Mine Company still maintains reasonable prices, supplying those with purchase tickets on schedule without interruption, so those with tickets do not have to worry about a shortage of coal this winter. Gasoline costs as much as 78 Federal Reserve dollars on the black market for every 5-gallon can, causing cars to gradually disappear. Initially, public buses and truck owners mixed kerosene into gasoline to save costs, but two weeks ago, kerosene, which could be bought at a normal price, has also soared, with prices approaching those of gasoline. Now, bicycles are the only way to transport goods, but Hercules bicycles have now risen from around 150 Federal Reserve dollars to 500 dollars. The price of rice has risen by about 50 Federal Reserve dollars per bag in the past two days, and like other daily necessities, prices are still expected to continue to rise. After receiving notices from the government, some British and American expatriates have already withdrawn, while others are preparing to withdraw, but housing still cannot be rented directly from the owners. The prices demanded for furniture by residents who plan to move elsewhere are almost unbearable. (24th Reuters dispatch)

### Post Office Suspends Mail to France

Chongqing - The post office recently issued a notice stating that postal relations with the occupied and free zones of France and its colonies, as well as various foreign countries (excluding Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway), have been severed, so no more mail or packages can be forwarded through the free zone.

### Kurusu Cables Tokyo, Reporting on the Talks; Pacific Nations Continue to Prepare Strong Economic Sanctions Against Japan

United Press, Washington, 24th - Although officials and government personnel have not confirmed any progress in the U.S.-Japan talks, some diplomats believe there are signs of smooth progress. The reasons for optimism are based on the following developments: After a meeting with Secretary of State Hull on the evening of the 22nd, Saburo Kurusu and Kichisaburo Nomura held a lengthy meeting with officials from the U.S. Embassy and subsequently sent an extremely long coded telegram to Tokyo. It is said that the telegram may have included new requests from Hull, but this has not been confirmed. Japanese newspapers have stopped their anti-American criticism. Yesterday, Tokyo newspapers predicted that "a new and hopeful development could restore trade between the United States and Japan." It is believed that Japan is concerned about the serious warning from the United States, Britain, China, and the Netherlands that they have jointly prepared to resist Japanese aggression. At the five-nation diplomatic representatives' meeting held on the 22nd, all diplomatic representatives unanimously agreed that the United States would be the leader in the Far East. The holding of this meeting is interpreted by all parties as a warning to Japan, as all countries are determined to maintain their interests in East Asia and that unless Japan makes more concessions, all relevant countries will continue to impose strong economic sanctions against Japan.

Reuters, Tokyo, 24th - Well-informed sources here claim that it would take a "miracle" for the U.S.-Japan talks to come to a satisfactory conclusion. This morning, many morning newspapers prominently reported on Hull's discussions with the diplomatic representatives of China, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies in Washington. Many observers here believe that the Washington talks must contain possibilities that the Japanese here cannot perceive. However, others say that this is impossible, as the Washington talks are merely restating old matters.

United Press, Tokyo, 24th - Tokyo newspapers today condemned the U.S., Britain, China, Australia, and Dutch East Indies representatives' meeting in Washington. The Dumin Yushinbun said that the United States and other countries hostile to Japan must accept Prime Minister Konoe's principles for peace in the Pacific, as this is the only way to maintain peace in the Pacific. It also said that this kind of threatening method "is no longer effective." The Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun's headline referred to the meeting as "The United States Convenes Countries Hostile to Japan to Strengthen the Base for Resisting Japan." The Asahi Shimbun interpreted the Washington meeting as part of a U.S. plan to report on the progress of the U.S.-Japan talks and to plan countermeasures to resist Japan. It also said, "This indicates that the United States is still insincere towards Japan, and Japan cannot remain indifferent to this." However, the newspaper still prominently published Hull's informal meeting with Nomura and Kurusu under a large headline, saying, "The United States and Japan are making sincere efforts to maintain peace in the Pacific."

### Germany Gathers Vast Military Force, Fiercely Assaulting Moscow on Multiple Routes; Red Army's Seventeen Divisions Strive to Defend the Capital, Nazi Offensive Hindered, Advance Slowed

TASS Central Front, 24th – The Pravda special correspondent reports that in the Moscow battle of the past twenty-four hours, the enemy's achievements were greater than the previous day, the situation more severe. Large German tank units have pressed towards Klin. The Moscow Defense Divisions fought most heroically, not allowing the enemy to advance a single step. However, in some areas (especially the Volokolamsk Highway), the enemy has made progress, seizing several villages. Currently, the enemy is attempting to capture Moscow with forty divisions, while the Soviet forces defending the capital consist of only seventeen divisions.

TASS Central Front, 24th – The Pravda special correspondent reports that our army continues to fight stubbornly with the enemy, retreating to new defense lines in some areas. The Germans have advanced slightly in the areas of Volokolamsk, Mozhaisk, and southeast of Tula. In the northern area, German forces have reached the city of Klin, pressing along the Volokolamsk Avenue. Fierce battles are underway at points V and S in the southern area. The fighting ceased at night, with some areas continuing to engage in intense combat. There have been no changes in the areas of Naro-Fominsk and Maloyaroslavets. The enemy is massing large tank units in some areas to attempt to break through our defense lines using numerical superiority. However, the resistance of our troops and civilians is extremely outstanding. Comparing the enemy's offensive on the Western Front in early November with that of October, we can point out that the German advance has slowed by three or four times. The enemy's method of encirclement with large armies has also failed.

TASS Central Front, 24th – Fighting continues day and night in the Volokolamsk area. The enemy attempts to seize the highway leading to Moscow, but after bloody battles, the enemy has been forced to retreat three kilometers. Soviet armored vehicle units fought extremely bravely, directly attacking enemy concentrations, firing two hundred and twenty shells, annihilating two battalions of enemy infantry and many tanks.

Southern Front Red Army Wins Victory, Crushing Three German Divisions

TASS, Moscow, 24th – The Soviet Information Bureau declares that the Red Army has achieved a complete victory after launching a counter-offensive west of Rostov on the Southern Front. In the three days from November 20th to 23rd, the Red Army crushed the German 19th Mountain Infantry Corps, the SS "Wiking" Division, and the 6th Tank Division. Our army also captured 111 artillery pieces, 55 tanks, 83 machine guns, and 365 trucks. The enemy left behind as many as 7,000 corpses. During the same period, we destroyed 46 German aircraft. At the end of the 23rd, the Red Army was still pursuing enemy troops closely, advancing up to 60 kilometers.

TASS Southern Front, 24th – Intense battles are currently unfolding along a lengthy 100-kilometer front on the Southern Front. Our army has switched to the offensive. The Red Army is currently engaged in fierce battles for several important high grounds. All Red Army units are making very successful progress, having captured point T and driven enemy troops out of several other key points. German attempts to counter-attack have failed. The fighting in town V is the most intense, changing hands several times. It has now been recaptured by our army. Under our army's strong offensive, the enemy is unable to withstand and is retreating westward. The enemy has suffered heavy losses. On the 20th alone, the enemy lost 3,000 men, 460 trucks, and 37 artillery pieces. The Red Army of Laputin has advanced 35 kilometers.

TASS Southern Front, 24th – The Pravda special correspondent reports that fierce fighting continued in area O in the Kursk sector on the 21st and 22nd. On the 20th and 21st, our army annihilated three enemy battalions in this area. The German side advanced slightly with large tank units, but paid a heavy price. The Bakhovsky cavalry, under the cover of artillery, retook several villages, annihilating a thousand enemy soldiers. In the Don River area, our army forced the enemy to retreat. The enemy has now switched to the defensive.

Haitong News Agency, 24th, Führer's Headquarters – The German High Command announced this afternoon that German forces on the Central Front of the Eastern Front continue to make progress. After fierce fighting, the town of Solnechnogorsk, 50 kilometers northwest of Moscow, has been occupied by German forces. German aircraft also bombed railway lines in the Moscow area, with considerable success. Soviet forces on the Leningrad front attempted to break through but failed. German artillery continues to bombard military targets in the city of Leningrad, causing heavy damage to the enemy.

Rostov Street Battles, Soviet Victory on the Northern Front

Reuters, London, 24th – Soviet sources have just admitted for the first time that the Soviet defense line in the city of Rostov-on-Don has been breached, resulting in street battles. However, on the Northern Front, Soviet forces have driven German forces out of the city of Malaya Vishera (40 miles northeast of Novgorod) on the Leningrad-Moscow railway. The Germans suffered over a thousand casualties in this city and are currently retreating. As for the German breakthrough into Rostov, it was achieved only after incurring great costs. The German High Command's recent communiqué described it as a "new victory" without elaborating. The new German offensive in the Donets Basin is now meeting fierce resistance from the newly formed Soviet forces under General Timoshenko. The German side has not issued any news about the fighting in this area. However, Soviet sources report that Soviet forces are currently containing the German offensive, and in several locations have driven back the German forces. The new offensive launched towards Moscow is being led by tanks. Mention of Klin in the battle reports indicates that German pressure north of Moscow has forced Soviet forces in this area to retreat. Intense German attacks in the areas of Kalinin, Volokolamsk, and Mozhaisk are also forcing the Soviet forces to retreat slightly. However, the rate of advance of the German forces in this new offensive is far lower than in the previous large-scale offensive. Soviet forces in the Tula, Maloyaroslavets, and Roslavl areas on the Moscow front seem to be holding their positions. Soviet forces in the Leningrad area crossed the frozen Neva River and advanced, but German sources report that these attacks have been repelled. Moscow announced last night that Soviet forces in Karelia had won a victory. It is claimed that German and Finnish forces who invaded the Soviet left flank in the Kostamuksha and Ukhta areas were driven back to their original positions after four days of fierce fighting. Soviet forces in Crimea, at the southern end of the front, are also repelling German forces. Berlin says that Soviet forces are currently counter-attacking in the Sevastopol area of the peninsula. Recent Soviet communiqués announced that there was fighting along the entire front yesterday, and that the fighting was particularly fierce in the Klin, Volokolamsk, Tula, and Rostov areas. Ten German aircraft were destroyed on the 22nd, and four Soviet aircraft were lost. Soviet ships sank three enemy transport ships in the Eastern Barents Sea.

TASS, Moscow, 24th – The Red Star correspondent reports that the Red Army on the Northern Front continues to make progress at all points. The Red Army of Klikov, after retaking Maliye Vishery, continued to advance and has reached the outskirts of another city. The infantry of Gusav also recaptured several key points on the 22nd. The fighting in the Tikhvin area is the most intense. Although the enemy is resisting stubbornly, our army continues to occupy many key points.

### Soviet Spokesman Says War Enters Sustained Phase; Soviet Forces Forced to Retreat in Many Areas, Important Frontlines Still Resist Bravely

Reuters, Kuibyshev, 24th – Soviet spokesman Lozovsky recently summarized the results of the first few months of the Soviet-German war, saying that Hitler still has some reserve troops, but they will soon be exhausted, because the Red Army does not intend to give the German forces a moment's rest during the entire winter campaign. The German side holds the foolish idea that they can consolidate the front line in winter and wait for the arrival of spring and summer, but I can guarantee that the German forces will definitely not be able to hold securely on the Eastern Front throughout the winter and move out large armies to attack Britain. Hitler's blitzkrieg plan has failed. Hitler's hope of uniting the world against the Soviet Union has been shattered. The situation has now completely changed. Hitler's hope of annihilating the Soviet army has not been realized, because it cannot be done. Hitler thought that the Soviet Union would feel its strength exhausted after losing several industrial centers, but he does not know that Soviet factories have been evacuated to places far from where German aircraft can fly, and are now working non-stop. Therefore, all of Hitler's estimates are invalid. The war is now gradually entering a sustained phase. The resources of the Soviet Union and its allied countries are inexhaustible. This is the reason why Germany and Italy's sixth month of operations against the Soviet Union, although claiming success, has yielded results that are contrary to their wishes. Asked about the British army's advance in Libya, he said that any blow to the German forces on any front is beneficial to both Britain and the Soviet Union. However, the impact of the British army's advance in Libya on the Eastern Front is difficult to estimate, because the extent of the fighting there is not yet known, and the number of German and Italian troops currently fighting in North Africa is also very important.

Reuters, Moscow, 24th – The German High Command seems to have made a final, desperate effort before the onset of severe winter to achieve its objectives. Fierce battles are taking place along the entire 2,000-mile-long Soviet border front. Soviet sources admit that Soviet forces in many areas have retreated into pre-arranged positions, but on all important frontlines, Soviet forces are holding their positions despite extremely fierce attacks. Yesterday, German tanks in the Tula area, assisted by mechanized units, repeatedly attacked Soviet defense lines. The left flank was engaged in fierce fighting all day. According to the Soviet official news agency, German forces attacked some locations five or six times. Their bombers bombed fiercely, attempting to clear the way for German forces on the ground. A team of German tanks once broke through the Soviet front line, but has been stopped on the outskirts of Tula and is being gradually destroyed by Soviet tanks and artillery. German advances in other locations have failed to advance north or east due to the resistance of Soviet infantry, closely assisted by tanks and artillery. The German army has suffered heavy casualties and is currently rushing to transfer reserve troops to replenish its ranks. In the Volokolamsk area, 70 miles northwest of Moscow, fierce battles continued throughout Saturday and Sunday. German forces are currently advancing along the Volokolamsk Highway, but are being hampered by Soviet counter-attacks and are not making progress.

Reuters, London, 24th – U.S. Lend-Lease Administrator to Britain, Harriman, broadcast here last night, guaranteeing that the United States will supply Britain with all its supplies and trusting that the Soviet Union will fight to the end, saying in brief: Americans are very grateful that Britain can make such good use of the supplies provided by the United States. When the United States was proceeding slowly, the British were quite patient, although they asked why the United States had labor unrest, why production was delayed, and when it would start to participate in the war, they were able to understand, because they had not forgotten the period they had experienced themselves. It is not easy for peace-loving democratic countries to immediately enter

war.

Americans have always believed that our ocean is the Maginot Line, which can keep us out of the wars of the old world, but the loss of American ships sailing to Britain in the Atlantic War caused us to first start maritime patrols, and then dispatch naval escorts. The current shooting actions of the U.S. Navy are still keeping the United States out of the war, but in the past few months, the term "out of the war" has had a new meaning. We truly know that we cannot enjoy peace until Hitlerism is destroyed. Since the restrictive clauses of the Neutrality Act were repealed last week, American ships can now sail into the ports of belligerent countries. The construction program for American warships and merchant ships is proceeding faster than planned. The United States is determined to see Britain obtain the supplies promised by the United States. American tanks and airplanes have already been shipped to the Middle East and are now carrying British soldiers to fight in the Libyan desert. I have spoken with British soldiers driving American airplanes, and they have great faith in the United States. The entire American people are now spiritually with the British army on the desert battlefield. We hope and pray that American-made airplanes and tanks can be effective and play a part in this critical battle. At the same time, American equipment is also being transported to another front, namely the Soviet Union. I recently traveled to Moscow with British Lord Beaverbrook on behalf of the President of the United States. I fully agree with Lord Beaverbrook's feelings about this trip, and believe that the Soviet Union will

continue to struggle.

The American people are certainly unwilling to have communism in their country. Many people did not initially understand the important meaning of the Soviet resistance, but as a result of our trip to the Soviet Union and the rapid action of Britain, the obstacles to our full support for the Soviet Union have been eliminated. Most Americans now know that helping the Soviet Union resist Germany does not harm our attitude toward communism. I recently heard a few things that can prove the complete inaccuracy of the pessimistic predictions about the Soviet resistance made by some people. Two American aviation officers spent two months in the Soviet Union, assisting in the coordination of American airplanes and training Soviet pilots. They recently told me that Soviet pilots can fly American airplanes, and that the training period is short and the number of accidents is small, even more so than American trainees. The skills and hard work of Soviet mechanics can also be a model for Britain and the United States. They work outdoors for fourteen hours a day from morning to night, and never stop even when encountering wind or rain. Therefore, American Air Force instructors who initially went to the Soviet Union with doubts now, because of daily contact, conclude that the Soviet people will definitely be able to make good use of the advantageous equipment that the United States can supply. The American mission to the Soviet Union took time out during a short trip to the Soviet Union to inspect many factories, and saw that the equipment in the factories was the most

advanced machinery

from Britain and the United States, and the managers were all personnel who had studied British and American working methods. The work and organization were both good, and the airplanes made in the Soviet Union were indeed good combat equipment. The workers were willing to work unpaid on holidays to help increase production. Stalin, who commands the Soviet armies in all areas, is extremely intelligent, capable, and decisive. In summary, we saw the determination to fight and the belief in ultimate victory everywhere in the Soviet Union. Now Britain is also providing the Soviet Union with supplies, and President Roosevelt is as determined as British Prime Minister Churchill. He also hates Hitler and the destructive forces he has unleashed on the world. The Roosevelt-Churchill meeting has produced eight principles. The expectations of Britain and the United States for the future and their desire to work side by side to achieve common goals are self-evident, but to eliminate suspicion forever, we must understand each other and not lack patience and sacrifice. Today, war is the test before us. The American people now understand this meaning even more. The so-called policy of isolation has now become a thing of the past.

### British Submarine in Mediterranean Heavily Damages Italian Convoy

Reuters, London, 24th – The British Army has launched a desert offensive and is continuing to advance westward. At the same time, British submarines and airplanes in the Mediterranean are once again inflicting a major blow on Mussolini's fleet, which has been significantly reduced in strength. According to a Navy Department communiqué, submarines of the British fleet in the Mediterranean attacked an enemy convoy and three enemy escorting cruisers and destroyers on the night of the 21st. Among them, one cruiser and one destroyer were hit by torpedoes and may have sunk. In addition, two enemy supply ships were also hit by torpedoes. Another enemy cruiser was hit and damaged by a torpedo dropped by a British plane. One enemy merchant ship of the "Huxing" type may also have been hit, and several other enemy ships were hit by bombs. British planes also came to help in the battle, launching a major attack. At that time, there were only two enemy cruisers left, and there was oil slick on the surrounding sea surface.

### Leader of U.S. Military Mission Returns to Chongqing; Met with British Generals in Singapore; Terpguh Cooper Says Will Not Close Burma Road

Reuters, Singapore, 24th – Major General Magruder, the leader of the U.S. Military Mission to China, departed today for Chongqing after a brief stopover here. He met with British military leaders here.

Reuters, Wellington, 24th – New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, in a speech at a public banquet honoring Terpguh Cooper this afternoon, said that we do not want to fight in the Pacific, but want to live in peace with all countries. We sincerely hope that peace in the Pacific will be maintained, but one thing can be determined, that is, no matter what, we will not sacrifice any nation or country or the principles of war, because New Zealand firmly believes that it is better to die a glorious death than to live a shameful life. Terpguh Cooper also said that what he had seen and heard in New Zealand was enough to make him realize that the people here had participated in the war 100%. He hoped that the British-owned countries in the Pacific would have a major performance in the coming storms.

Reuters, Wellington, 24th – British Cabinet Far East Representative Terpguh Cooper said here yesterday in response to questions that there was no sign that the Burma Road would be closed again and that war materials would not be transported into China.

Reuters, Melbourne, 24th – British Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, General Blamey, will depart for the Middle East after attending the War Cabinet meeting to be held in Canberra next Wednesday.

According to Wartime Mobilization of Resources in Thailand

United Press, Los Angeles, 24th – The National Broadcasting Company here received a telegram from Sydney without funds, broadcasting that Thailand has fully mobilized all resources in accordance with wartime conditions.

United Press, Bangkok, 24th – The Thai Propaganda Department considers the intrusion of French and Japanese aircraft into its airspace to be unimportant. The department stated that one Japanese aircraft that was reported to have flown over the Thai border may have been a passenger plane, and that the French aircraft were only photographing for the border demarcation committee. The Propaganda Department also considered the number of Japanese troops in Vietnam to be insufficient for military consideration, saying that this was permitted by the Franco-Japanese joint defense agreement. At the same time, Thai newspapers stated that the government is currently considering mobilizing the entire country on a wartime basis.

Editorial

### Gaining Mutual Trust From Self-Confidence

Today, everyone admits that China has attained the most advantageous position; it could be said it is a superior atmosphere never experienced since the four-year-plus arduous fight. Diplomatically speaking, all democratic nations maintain clear and decisive propositions regarding the Far Eastern situation. The American guarantee to aid China is even more sworn and unquestionable. The increasingly strong ABCD front fully reflects the inevitable fate of the invaders collapsing. Compared to the period when the Yunnan-Burma Road was sealed last summer, such a diplomatic situation cannot truly be measured in terms of gains and losses. As for the military, after the Japanese army launched two general offensives in northern Hunan and northern Henan in the early autumn of this year, and were fiercely resisted by the Chinese army resulting in major victories, the Japanese army's intention to resolve the China incident by force has clearly wavered completely. The recent reports that the Japanese army was gathering in Vietnam with the intention of invading Kunming has also gradually subsided as large numbers of Chinese troops have steadily arrived on the Yunnan border. As for China's entire army, the new army has already grown up. Regarding the replenishment of soldiers, the equipment of weapons, and the bombers shipped from the United States, these are all obvious facts that need not be concealed. These are all sufficient to cope with any new offensive at any time, and in the near future, the general counter-offensive to finally end the Sino-Japanese war can be launched. Speaking of politics, China has recognized since the hard fought battles that politics should be given as much weight as military affairs. The continuous construction in the rear area, and the gradual strengthening of administrative institutions are all in the eyes of the world. The National Political Consultative Council recently held in the capital city, especially, was able to lay bare their hearts, express their opinions, and abandon past prejudices and misunderstandings to jointly plan sincere unity to lay the foundation for the great cause of resisting aggression and building the country. The enthusiastic situation of this session is also unprecedented.

Therefore, in terms of diplomacy, military affairs, and politics, China has indeed achieved the most advantageous position under the umbrella of an optimistic atmosphere. However, when we look back at China's arduous struggles over the past four years and study the outstanding environment that it has been able to achieve today, we must give credit to the "self-confidence" of the entire Chinese nation. Since the incident, China has recognized that only fighting to the end can guarantee survival, and only fighting to the end can plan for the permanent freedom of the entire nation. Therefore, under any difficult circumstances, it has held the will to never compromise and never yield, upholding strong convictions, advancing bravely and directly, advancing without retreating, winning without losing. Today's achievements rely purely on this kind of strength of "self-confidence." As an ancient saying goes, "Having it in oneself is called faith." China's "self-confidence" comes from this kind of spiritual training.

Because of self-confidence, it is even more expanded to gain international mutual trust. At present, the countries on the anti-aggression front unanimously recognize that China is fighting for world justice and sacrificing for the civilization of all mankind. China has already accomplished the task of charging into battle on the Pacific anti-aggression front. Therefore, all countries unanimously trust China, give it sympathy, and give it assistance. As British Prime Minister Churchill said: "Under the guidance of the great Asian hero Generalissimo Chiang, the Chinese people have fought single-handedly for five long years without the slightest slackening. How can we see their amazing defense of national territory, freedom, and independence without being moved?" These words are a sincere and enthusiastic expression of trust in China.

As for the "non-recognition doctrine" that the United States has revealed since September 18th and its firm position in safeguarding the Nine-Power Treaty, it has been sufficient for China to know what to trust. Although there were occasional incidents where the United States had to show a slight appeasement toward Japan due to the constraints of isolationists or because its preparations were not yet fully sufficient, the firm and unwavering policy of the United States after the start of U.S.-Japan talks has caused the world's past suspicions about appeasement to be swept away, with no room for further accusations. The five-power conference of China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia, held in Washington the day before yesterday, unanimously agreed to fully support the position of the United States, and issued a stern warning to Japan, declaring the common viewpoint of the anti-aggression front. U.S. Secretary of State Hull has agreed to notify all relevant countries of the developments in the U.S.-Japan talks at any time. From this meeting, we can see that the attitudes of the five powers are very sincere and frank, and the degree of mutual trust is also at its peak.

In short, China gains mutual trust from self-confidence. The democratic nations are also combined through mutual trust, forming a strong and unbreakable power. At present, there is only the effort of division of labor and cooperation, with no psychological morbidity. It is already a matter of time to jointly shatter the aggressor's dreams, and there is absolutely no doubt about it.

### Problems with Reconstruction Planning

Today, if we were to test public opinion and ask what the central ideology of the nation is, we can confidently assert that the majority of answers, whether openly expressed as slogans or tacitly acknowledged, would belong to the national policy of resistance and reconstruction. This is the nation's determination, and it is the key to survival and continuity. Therefore, those responsible for the national policy of resistance and reconstruction should be humble and open-minded, gathering ideas widely to complete the grand plan of resistance and reconstruction. The people should spare no sacrifice, contributing everything they have to support the implementation of this fixed national policy. In other words, today's national policy of resistance and reconstruction must be regarded as the crystallized product of the entire nation, and the leaders should direct the entire nation to take responsibility, cooperate, and work together to achieve the genuine completion of resistance and reconstruction.

The first step is to seek final victory. Now, the arrival of victory is not far off, as we all generally agree. What we want to discuss now is the issue of reconstruction after the victory, which is the second step. This step is more complex in nature and has a more serious impact. If we have the former victory but lack the latter's support, it will inevitably become a case of "falling short of success after piling up nine loads of earth towards building a mountain." The failure of the Allied powers to achieve political and economic reconstruction after their military victory in World War I led to the outbreak of World War II. This is a profound lesson worthy of vigilance. President Roosevelt has repeatedly assured the world that he will realize a plan for equal material enjoyment for all humanity, and we firmly believe that he will fulfill this promise. Our country's economy is fragile, so we should not expect too much, but we should do our best to implement a national construction plan that provides at least the minimum requirements for our people.

The scope of national construction is very broad. Now, let's briefly outline the main points of economic construction, with the sole principle being that postwar construction should be more advanced and more concrete than prewar construction. The so-called "concrete" and "advanced" mean that construction must be based on plans and implemented step by step, not just superficially embellished with proposals or empty talk on paper. Moreover, the efficiency of construction must be improved as much as possible. What used to be accomplished with the effort of ten people and ten yuan should now be accomplished with the effort of five people and five yuan, and the completion time must also be greatly shortened, ultimately aiming to save manpower, financial resources, and time to achieve the highest production efficiency.

In the past, when we talked about construction plans, we often thought that completing a certain number of miles of railways or highways within a three- or five-year period was enough to fulfill our mission. However, according to the essence of modern planned economy, the mission of planning is certainly not limited to this. The purpose of building roads is never for the sake of building roads alone, but to achieve the expected results after the construction is completed. The so-called expected results are not empty theories that benefit people's lives, but concrete results must be presented, and the results presented must be judged based on the amount of the cost. Finally, no matter how economical the cost is, it is necessary to examine whether the construction has other impacts. This was the embryo of the reconstruction policy after the Russian Revolution, and it was also the case with the model of planned economy in Germany after World War I.

Regarding the backwardness of the Russian Empire before the 1917 revolution, Stalin severely criticized it, saying, "The history of ancient Russia only shows backwardness and submission to other countries. Military, business, culture, agriculture, and politics were all backward..." When Lenin established the Soviet Union, he strongly advocated: "We must re-balance the construction of agriculture and industry, but to achieve this goal, we must first find the basis of strength. What is the basis of industry and agriculture? Nothing but railways and river and sea transportation." The past economy of the Soviet Union and the current situation of our country have many similarities, and after the implementation of the first five-year plan, the various backwardnesses pointed out by Stalin were swept away. All the tools of civilization that advanced countries had were available in the Soviet Union. Now, as the second five-year plan is about to be completed, it has been engulfed in the vortex of war, and its substantial strength can be imagined. This is all due to the effectiveness of its plan implementation.

Our country's reconstruction urgently needs to be realized step by step, and our country has all three major conditions of favorable climate, geographical advantages, and popular support, which is even better than European and American countries. We sincerely hope that the authorities will quickly establish a plan and implement it step by step to complete the grand plan of national construction.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in the Western Desert; German and Italian Forces Cut into Four Segments; New Zealand Troops Occupy Gambut; Besieged German and Italian Forces Being Annihilated

Reuters, London, 24th—According to a recent Middle East communiqué, after occupying the Azizi and Capuzzo forts, New Zealand troops advanced along the highway between Treves and Capuzzo and have now occupied Gambut, an important enemy supply center between Tobruk and Bardia. The main tank battles between British and Axis armored forces are now taking place in the El Gazala area, with extremely fierce fighting. British troops attacking from Tobruk are consolidating the positions they have captured. Among the captured enemy supplies are several heavy artillery pieces. It is reported that British troops have now captured 15,000 enemy soldiers and estimate that the enemy has lost 600 tanks, accounting for half of all they possessed when the battle began. It is widely believed that the German army has recalled some air force from the eastern front, and on the ground, the German army is reportedly rushing new equipment, especially focusing on flat-trajectory guns, machine guns, and bullets. Currently, the British army has cut the German and Italian forces into four segments, among which those trapped without water in the Sollum and Halfaya Pass are in the most critical situation. According to reports from London, the first phase of the Libyan campaign has passed, with the British army fully benefiting. The second phase involves annihilating the dispersed and besieged enemy forces, and is proceeding smoothly.

Reuters, London, 24th—New Zealand troops in North Africa set out from Capuzzo fort and occupied Bardia without a fight. Now, the Axis forces between Tobruk, Gobi, and the Egyptian border have been severely attacked by the British army and divided into four or more groups. One of these groups has been cut off from its base between Sollum and Halfaya. According to responsible sources, this group of enemy troops can only escape by breaking through or defeating the British army. Another group of enemy troops seems to be isolated in the Gambut area, and another group of enemy troops trapped near Gobi has also had its rear route cut off. The group of enemy troops besieged in the Sollum area is mostly Italian and is roughly equivalent to an infantry division, with some tanks and mechanized units attached.

British Forces Control the Air and Continuously Bomb Transportation Lines

Reuters, Cairo, 24th—Officials announced that the British Air Force, on Saturday and Sunday, made low-altitude attacks on enemy tanks, armored vehicles, and motor vehicles on the road between Adam and Akroma, destroying over a hundred enemy trucks and many gasoline trucks. The road was blocked by the wreckage of trucks. On the road between Bas and Derna, enemy trucks and transport vehicles were also attacked, causing significant damage. British bombers attacked road traffic and enemy transport vehicles in the Derna and Gazala areas. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground in Gambut. Two German aircraft were shot down in air combat, and several others were damaged. When British aircraft attacked Agosti, one enemy naval vessel was damaged and patrol boats in the port were also strafed. A total of thirteen British aircraft did not return from the sorties.

Reuters, Cairo, 24th—The tank battle southeast of Tobruk has now entered its fifth day and is still underway, with the advantage going to the British armored units, and the control of air dominance firmly in the hands of the British Air Force. According to battle reports received in Cairo, the majority of the two armored divisions under General Rommel are apparently trying to break through the gap between Tobruk and El Gazala and rush westward. There are two routes for their breakthrough, but they are difficult to traverse due to weather conditions. On Saturday and Sunday, there was continuous heavy rain along the coast, but the British army was not hindered by the rain. The general situation after five days of battle is not very clear due to the lack of detailed reports. Recent battle reports state, "Enemy troops have been discovered in a certain area, and our troops are currently engaged in battle, and do not have time for detailed reports." Intense fighting is currently taking place in an important area southeast of Tobruk, where the advancing British troops are attempting to establish contact with the Tobruk garrison. Rommel's plan is clearly not to prevent the British forces from joining forces or to break through and retreat. However, it is not yet possible to determine Rommel's strategy, nor is it easy to ascertain the strength of the enemy forces encountered by the British army or how many tanks the Axis powers still have. It is now reported that an Italian armored division, which suffered heavy losses when the British army crossed the border, has become active again. The British army is maneuvering in the desert, imitating the enemy's usual tactic of flanking the enemy, and has occupied many Axis strongholds.

New Zealand Troops Advance Rapidly, Striking the Germans with Lightning Speed

According to a Reuters correspondent accompanying the troops, examining the route taken by the New Zealand troops on a map reveals that this was a lightning strike. They moved rapidly north from Omarsi to Alaziqi, then abruptly turned east, and with unexpected action, seized the Capuzzo fort behind the lines. Then, they doubled back and arrived at the current front line south of Bardia. With the enemy troops temporarily withdrawing from Bardia, Rommel was undoubtedly bewildered by the unpredictability of the British army's actions. Rommel's troops are now divided into five groups, but some of them still have some combat effectiveness. At the same time, Indian troops are also adopting similar tactics, advancing rapidly from south to north along the border line of the Wehrmacht troops. Rommel's decision to withdraw from Bardia is surprising. A reporter who stayed in Bardia for several days a year ago after the British army captured it still feels that its fortifications are thorough and extensive. In addition to the outer line of forts, there are deep gorges as obstacles. The Italian army had dug large air-raid shelters here to store ammunition. Bardia has a good small port, and Rommel could have made Bardia a second Tobruk, but one thing made it difficult, namely that Germany did not have dominance over the Mediterranean and could not provide support, unlike Britain, which could continuously supply the Tobruk garrison. The news of the German army's withdrawal from Bardia is proof of the great achievements of the British Navy in the current battle situation.

Reuters, London, 24th—A Reuters military commentator says that there seem to be various reasons to believe that the main force of the German army's armored vehicles in North Africa has fallen into encirclement east of Tobruk. The British army's offensive caught the enemy by surprise, and the German army certainly did not expect the British army to launch such a large-scale offensive, otherwise they would have escaped the British army's encirclement. It is surprising that the British forces, in addition to aiding the Soviet Union and strengthening the Far East defenses, and maintaining the strength of the domestic front, can launch such a large-scale and fierce offensive in North Africa. British tanks and armored vehicles in North Africa can not only lay a siege line around hundreds of square miles of land, but also have the strength to repel enemy attempts to break through on a large scale. German tanks have repeatedly attacked this siege line, but have been repelled, suffering increasing damage, and their hope of breaking through and escaping is becoming increasingly weak and may not last long, and the time for its resolution must not be far off.

### US Army Second Battalion Scheduled to Depart for the Philippines Tomorrow; Delayed by One Day Due to Painting Cabin; First Battalion to Leave Shanghai at the End of the Month

Will be Accompanied to the Dock by a Band for a Farewell Ceremony

The US President Lines' President Madison arrived in port on Friday (21st) afternoon at around 3:00 PM and berthed at pontoons 14 and 15. After unloading incoming cargo, it will not load export cargo, but will exclusively load the base of the 4th Marine Regiment, and has been busy loading for days. Because the Second Battalion of the 4th Marine Regiment is taking the ship to the Philippines, the ship will repaint the cabins. Originally scheduled to depart today, the departure was changed to tomorrow because the painting will only be completed today. Another US mail ship, the President Harrison, is expected to arrive in Shanghai around Thursday this week. At that time, the First Battalion will withdraw on the ship. The US troops stationed in Tianjin will come directly from Tianjin to leave China by transport ship.

Farewell Broadcast

When the second batch of Marines leaves Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek will give an interesting broadcast that will be broadcast to major cities and towns in the United States. This interesting broadcast will be a farewell gift for the US Marines stationed in China for 14 years, adding a lot of color. At the same time, it is also an unprecedented event in the Chinese radio broadcasting industry. This matter is currently being planned by Major Hamilton, an officer of the Public Relations Office of the 4th Regiment, and McKay of Citibank. At that time, Colonel Howard, Commander of the US 4th Marine Regiment, and Rear Admiral Grasford, Commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, will give speeches. Radio reporters will carry microphones and accompany the battalion from Jing'an Temple Road through Nanjing Road to the Bund, reporting on the farewell scene along the way, and may at any time ask officials and soldiers to make brief remarks to the people of the East and West continents.

Band Farewell

The 2nd Battalion of the US 4th Marine Regiment, commanded by Colonel Collis, is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the morning of the 26th. At that time, there may be no grand review. The US Navy band will accompany the Marines, marching along Jing'an Temple Road and Nanjing Road to the Customs Wharf, and then take a ferry to board the Madison. The First Battalion is scheduled to withdraw from Shanghai on the 30th. Its route is the same as that of the Second Battalion. The band of the Chinese Orphanage will go to say goodbye. The US has scheduled a farewell on that day. The final farewell ceremony will be held at the Customs Wharf from 10:10 AM to 10:15 AM. According to history, the US 4th Marine Regiment has been in China for 14 years. It first came to China on February 24, 1927, on the US ship "Grasshopper." During their time in China, they made their best efforts to protect the lives and property of the people in the International Settlement. Colonel Howard and Major Hamilton visited Colonel Fabre and Colonel Smith of the French Concession and Public Concession Police Departments yesterday morning to say goodbye. At noon, Colonel Howard and his subordinates attended a farewell banquet held by Lieutenant Colonel Mann, commander of the Merchant Corps, at the Merchant Corps Club.

USS Wake Returns to Shanghai

The US gunboat USS Wake, which routinely sailed up the Yangtze River to Wuhu, returned to Shanghai on the 23rd, causing speculation that the Yangtze River Patrol of the US Asiatic Fleet would also withdraw from the Central China region. A US Navy official denied last night that the USS Wake's arrival in Shanghai was related to the possible withdrawal of US Asiatic Fleet warships. It is said that it is common for US warships to return after sailing up the Yangtze River. As for whether the personnel of the US Navy purchasing office in Shanghai will withdraw with the two President liners, it is not yet certain, but it is only confirmed that the purchasing office has prepared to withdraw all personnel.

US and British Communities Host Farewell Receptions

There are three more receptions this week hosted by British and American communities to say farewell to Colonel Howard, commander of the US 4th Marine Regiment, and other US military officers. From 6:00 to 7:00 PM last night, members of the American Club hosted a banquet for Colonel Howard and others. From 7:00 to 8:00 PM, the American Club was opened for US soldiers to say goodbye to friends. The American Community Federation is scheduled to host a banquet for Colonel Howard and his aides today and will present souvenirs on behalf of the British community. The St. George's Society of this city is scheduled to hold a reception on Wednesday to say farewell to Colonel Howard and others.

Farewell Service Filled the Room

The night before, when the 4th Marine Regiment held its last service at the Grand Theatre, the audience was extremely crowded. In his final speech, Pastor Trabue especially mentioned the religious and cultural life of the 4th Marine Regiment in Shanghai over the past 14 years.

British Community Withdrawal Advanced

The British community in this city will also withdraw. The British Consulate originally designated the first batch to leave Shanghai on the Taikoo Company's Anhui, which was to arrive in Shanghai next week. Yesterday, the British Consulate notified that the departure would be advanced and changed to the Jardine Matheson & Co.'s Mingsheng, which would sail south from Shanghai this week. The company received the notice and ordered the ship to stop loading passengers and cargo and exclusively use it for the withdrawal of overseas Chinese.

### Ningshao Company Suddenly Implements Layoffs, Employees Panicked; Only Verbal Announcement Beforehand; Salary Payments Stopped Mid-Month

The Ningshao Shipping Company has a long history and originally had three Jianghai ships. One ship sailed the Yangtze River, one ship sailed the Shanghai-Ningbo route, and one seagoing ship sailed the Shanghai-Fujian route. The seagoing ship sank off the coast of Fuzhou in the early winter of 1932 after hitting a reef. Later, there were only two ships left. Business was very prosperous. After the August 13th Incident, one Yangtze River ship sailed to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River near Yichang and berthed, and one ship changed its flag and sailed in eastern Zhejiang. The ship was suddenly detained in eastern Zhejiang last autumn and has not been released. Business has been suspended since then. The company's manager, Mr. Zhu, is still in Zhejiang. The city's company affairs were handled by another appointed agent. At the end of last month, a verbal announcement of layoffs was suddenly made. At that time, the employees did not have written notice and did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, salary payments, which were usually made on the 15th of the month, were stopped on the 15th of this month. The employees were panicked. The original salary could not maintain their livelihoods under the current market conditions. Once the salary is stopped, they will be in danger of starving. The employees convened a meeting the day before yesterday, demanding that the company authorities continue to maintain their livelihoods and requesting the payment of this month's salary. For a week now, the company has ignored the demand. It is now reported that employees will make further demands.

### Negotiations Approaching to Purchase All Stacked Rice; Second Batch of Stacked Rice to Be Sold Soon

The Shanghai Rice Merchants Association has now decided to start registering the second batch of rice merchants to sell the stacked foreign rice from tomorrow (Wednesday). All rice merchants registered after the 17th of this month must re-register from this day, but must fill in the following items in detail: 1.

Purchasing Stacked Rice

In order to thoroughly suppress rice prices and strictly crack down on the evil practices of manipulation, monopoly, and hoarding, the authorities of the two concessions are preparing to purchase all of the foreign rice stacked in the rice industry, with a price of 148.95 yuan per bag. The Bean and Grain Association convened all colleagues to solicit opinions. After repeated negotiations, it is said that clues have gradually been obtained. Yesterday, the Bean and Grain Association sent another letter to the authorities of the two concessions to continue negotiations on matters such as the purchase price of the stacked foreign rice.

### Sino-American Daily Sends Consolation Money to Soviet Union; Delivered to Soviet Representative Last Night

The Sino-American Daily of this port believes that the Soviet Red Army is resisting the German invasion on the Western Front with great determination. Its heroic and arduous struggle and its spirit of fighting for democracy are no different from the Chinese struggle. Therefore, it initiated a fundraising campaign for "Consolation Christmas Gift Money for the Soviet Union" of 10,000 yuan to give to Soviet soldiers. However, due to the time limit, it has not been able to collect 10,000 yuan. The newspaper specially obtained the consent of the readers to first allocate 10,000 yuan from the conscience donation and hand it over to the Soviet Union. Last night, the newspaper authorities specially invited Soviet representatives and representatives of various Allied countries in this port to hand over the consolation money. The Soviet representatives who attended were Zhai Viroff Logoff and Shulan Weiqi, etc. The Allied representatives who attended included representatives from Britain, the Netherlands, Norway, Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Free France. Alexander, director of the information office of the British Embassy, and others, totaling 15 people. First, the authorities of the Sino-American Daily presented the consolation money and made a speech. Then, Zhai Viroff, chairman of the Soviet Consolation Red Army Committee, accepted the money. The meeting lasted three hours and ended with the guests and hosts laughing and wishing the Allied powers final victory.

### Crossing the Road, Wait for the Lights

In view of the large and crowded population within the French Concession, and the frequent occurrence of traffic accidents on the roads, endangering the lives of residents, the French Concession has ordered the police to correct vehicle traffic at any time, and from yesterday onwards, pedestrians on major roads such as the French Bund are not allowed to cross the road at will, and should move forward according to the green light of the traffic command. Otherwise, a fine will be imposed. Therefore, yesterday, the pedestrians on each road, because they did not know the new traffic regulations in advance, a large number of them were arrested by the stationed police and fined two yuan at the police station.

### National Rice Implements Control, Prices Already Internally Set, Roughly 150 Yuan per Shi

Recently, some rice merchants have been arbitrarily raising the price of national rice because the price of national rice is not restricted, and are unwilling to sell No. 1 Saigon rice at 130 yuan. Therefore, there is a situation where Saigon rice is mixed with Songjiang rice and sold at a high price. In order to stabilize rice prices and prevent such actions by unscrupulous merchants, the authorities of the two concessions have prepared to implement control over national rice. However, in view of the fact that national rice is indeed superior to foreign rice, it is proposed to set the price of national rice at 150 yuan per shi (80 kilograms). This matter has been largely decided.

### Announcement of Price Limits on Second Batch of Goods; Police Supervision to be Enforced; Many Daily Necessities for Chinese Residents Not Included, Citizens Hope for Swift Formulation and Publication

Since the two concession authorities implemented price controls, they announced the first batch of retail price limits on the 18th of this month, covering 339 types of daily necessities, groceries, and medicines. On the 22nd, they announced the second batch of retail price limits, totaling 283 types, which came into effect yesterday. The police have been dispatching officers to supervise and inspect. However, businesses are still engaging in price gouging on items without price limits. Therefore, various parties hope that the authorities can quickly expand the scope of control, and that the Public Concession authority can adopt the same decisive measures as the French Concession authority. It is even more desirable to quickly set price limits on daily necessities for Chinese residents, which would greatly benefit all citizens. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency noted that the price-limited items announced by the authorities did not have Chinese translations. Yesterday, they specifically investigated various businesses at their addresses. The following is a record of the initial findings:

### Death of Wu Cuilun, Principal of Chengzhong Primary and Secondary School; Devoted Nearly Forty Years to Education

Mr. Wu Cuilun, the principal of the private Chengzhong Primary and Secondary School, served in the educational circles of Jiangsu and Shanghai for nearly forty years. He also served as the principal of Chengzhong School in this city for more than ten years. He always treated people with loyalty, forgiveness, diligence, and sincerity, which enabled him to win the respect and admiration of people from all walks of life, as well as colleagues and students. During the Songhu Incident, the Chengzhong School was located in Hongkou. The school buildings, properties, and accumulated savings over the years were almost completely destroyed. With empty hands and painstaking effort, he could not bear to see the achievements of the predecessors destroyed in one fell swoop. He ran around to raise funds and spared no effort. As a result, Chengzhong School was able to rebuild its school at the Tongyi Building on Beijing Road and resume its activities. After the school site was finalized, he procured all the necessary books, instruments, and teaching supplies in the absence of any other method. On Monday mornings, he would always gather the students and earnestly advise them to study diligently, cultivate morality, respect reality, and know shame. When it came to matters of great principle, he vigorously advocated integrity and did not hesitate to repeatedly admonish them. Therefore, in the refugee donations, winter clothing donations, and spring conscription relief donations of the past sessions, teachers and students were all generous in their contributions. In the past four years, the number has reached 7,000 gold pieces, and the "conscience contributions" of nearby residents were particularly enthusiastic. He was physically weak, but he still diligently worked for the public interest. As a result, his vitality was depleted day by day, and the disease was lurking without his knowledge. On the evening of the 11th of this month, he suddenly suffered from a high fever on his way home from school. After diagnosis by a Western doctor, it was determined to be typhus. Despite all efforts to treat him, it was to no avail. He passed away at 5:00 p.m. on the 22nd. The coffin will be closed at the Central Funeral Home on Mabai Road at 2:00 p.m. on the 25th. Relatives, friends, students, and others who heard the sad news all expressed their deep condolences, saying that he had devoted his life to education and died of overwork.

### Cai Huiquan Performs in Hong Kong

Cai Defeats Hong Kong Player Harryman; However, Suffers Defeat

Hong Kong, 23rd telegram. This afternoon, a tennis performance match was held here to raise funds for the United China Relief Association of the United States. Cai Huiquan, a Chinese player in the Davis Cup, and Harryman, a 25-year-old famous tennis player from California, both participated in the performance and competed with Hong Kong's top players. More than 2,000 spectators bought honorary tickets of 25 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan. Cai Huiquan defeated Hong Kong's singles player with a score of 1-6, 6-2, and 7-5. The enthusiastic atmosphere at the venue was unprecedented in Hong Kong. However, Harryman lost to Tao Guanqiu, who has been famous in Shanghai and Hong Kong for many years (Editor's note: possibly Tao Maonv), with a score of only 1-6 and 3-6. It is obvious that Mr. Harryman felt extremely tired after the sea voyage and was unable to fight. Cai and Harryman, together with the Lun brothers in doubles, each won one game. Due to insufficient light, the match could not be completed. They will perform again next Saturday and Sunday. Then, Cai and Harryman plan to visit Malaya.

### Hygiene for Couples in Early Winter

There are so many couples in the world who fall into a tragic realm because they do not know hygiene! It is a fact that a strong and energetic husband is often in the active position in sexual life. Although a wife hopes that her husband will be with her at all times, she does not always like that. However, when she is at the high tide of passion, she also hopes that her husband has a strong physique so that they can spend their happy life in the harmony of love. This is also the Creator's reward for the improvement of men's health. If a man loses his health due to promiscuity and indulgence, he should be fully responsible for it. Promiscuity and indulgence, as well as self-induced nocturnal emission, are most likely to deplete the reproductive gland fluid. The reproductive gland fluid is the source of our life. Therefore, men who are exhausted of essence are mostly suffering from neurasthenia, underdevelopment, premature ejaculation, impotence, premature aging, brain weakness, kidney deficiency, and other symptoms. At the same time, due to physical weakness and strong desire, in this long winter night, it is most likely to cause impulse and stir up his wife's enthusiasm, but it often appears like a flash in the pan and cannot satisfy her. How can this not arouse the wife's hatred? From hatred to the breakdown of feelings, there are many family tragedies such as elopement, divorce, and sad suicide!

If you do not conserve your essence in winter, you will definitely suffer from plagues in spring. This is common sense that every man should know. The early winter weather is "Little Spring", when chrysanthemums are in full bloom and crabs are plump. It is indeed a good time to enjoy life, but it must not be abused. Unless both husband and wife are full of enthusiasm and have the need to relieve their nerves, they should also go to bed early. It is okay to cultivate health after the event, but if it damages health, it is definitely not appropriate. In case there are already the above-mentioned symptoms due to early romance, it is necessary to seek thorough treatment as soon as possible. According to the world's famous doctors and my experience, the most effective treatment is to take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone". This agent is made by scientifically replicating the endocrine essence of reproductive glands extracted from strong animals such as apes, gorillas, and sea dogs, so the effective ingredients are completely preserved. Therefore, the quality of this agent is valuable, and the efficacy is reliable and rapid, which is unmatched by any similar preparation. After taking it, it can produce essence and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation in one day and night. It is especially valuable to take it continuously, which will further promote development and nourish the nerves, and it is necessary to cure all symptoms in a short period of time. Taking it for a winter can increase body weight and improve health day by day. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission should also take the world-famous "Hymitol Spermatorrhea Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage, which will definitely achieve faster results!

The patient Mr. Shen Jiqing, a native of Hang County, works in a certain bank. Because of early marriage and overindulgence, he suffered from nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation, and often suffered from forgetfulness and insomnia, which led to emotional discord between husband and wife, and it was difficult to be competent in his career! He came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment last month. After learning about his actual condition, I ordered him to purchase two dozen "Reproductive Hormones" for men and five boxes of "Hymitol Spermatorrhea Tablets" from the Yong'an Company's Western Medicine Department for him to take together, and applied electrotherapy injection and other methods. After a month and a half, all diseases were suddenly cured, and he was full of energy. Not only has the efficiency of work increased, but the love between husband and wife is even better than when they were newly married!

### The Influence of Breast Atrophy and Methods of Remedy

— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine

In today's era of progress and the omnipotence of science, not only the defects that people in the past thought were hopeless and regretted for life—freckles, flat noses, hanging eyes, missing teeth, etc.—can be transformed into normal shapes with sophisticated equipment and skilled surgery. Even a pair of breasts, which have always been ignored and are even more important than freckles, flat noses, hanging eyes, and missing teeth for women, now have a special agent that can make them stand tall. Because freckles, flat noses, and hanging eyes are indeed ugly on the outside, but they have little to do with health, while a woman's breasts, if they are atrophied, then the most noble and lovely curve of women cannot be formed. At the same time, it is even more important to health. Because the breasts of the sister-in-law can be high and tall, it all depends on the lively and healthy function of the ovaries. If the ovarian function is destroyed by menstrual diseases, leucorrhea, malnutrition, multiple births and weakness, etc., then the breasts will not have good development. Even those who already have good development will gradually atrophy, even flattening like a man. It is not necessary for such women to think of standing out in the social circle. In ordinary families, to be honest: (1) It is inevitable that they will be disgusted by their husbands, leading to the misfortune of prostitution and taking concubines. (2) It is difficult to have children, and it is even more difficult to have descendants! (3) Health and beauty are lost, with many diseases and pains. (4) Because there are no children, even if there are millions of properties, they can only be handed over to others. All of the above are facts that are commonly seen and heard by ordinary people, not the author's false words.

As for the remedy that the author said, women only need to have strong confidence, go to the pharmacy and point to purchase female "Reproductive Hormone", and take three tablets three times a day. After about four weeks, the appetite will inevitably increase, the spirit will be refreshed, and the muscles will gradually become plump. Continue to take it for four or five weeks, the mind will be clear, the blood will be strong, and the breasts will naturally gradually rise. At this time, the effect is already extremely obvious, but this agent is mild in nature and has no side effects, so it should be continued to be taken to ensure a rosy complexion, smooth muscles, and lasting youth.

### The Pathology and Treatment of Seminal Emission

— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases

From childhood to adulthood, reproductive function gradually matures, which is an inspiration for the future and happiness of young people! If you do not know how to cherish yourself, or are confused by curiosity and the temptation of a bad environment, commit self-abuse and homosexual love, or marry early and indulge in sex, destroying the sexual nerves, and after the sperm gate is loosened, seminal emission will inevitably erupt. Therefore, most of those who suffer from seminal emission must have neurasthenia. In this early winter, the weather is not cold, but they already have cold hands and feet and are mentally lethargic. If seminal emission is not treated for a long time, the sperm gate will become looser and looser, and the number of emissions will gradually increase. Many young people suffer from terrible spermatorrhea due to the failure to treat mild nocturnal emission. Seminal fluid is the source of our human life. If such a continuous and large amount of loss occurs, it will inevitably lead to the depletion of sperm and blood, and all diseases will be born. Then, symptoms such as weak brain, poor memory, dizziness, disordered dreams, insomnia, sore waist and back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, and underdevelopment are endless. Most of these young people are sallow-faced and thin, or externally strong but internally weak, and their energy is exhausted. If they are students in school, their academic performance will inevitably fall behind. Those who are engaged in work in the industrial and commercial circles will feel that it is difficult to be competent! At the same time, because of their unattractive appearance, they are often abandoned by the opposite sex and fall into the tragic situation of lovelorn. Even the married life after marriage is difficult to be harmonious, and various tragedies are constantly staged in the family! Or they may age prematurely and die young!

The tragedy after seminal emission is well known. Therefore, early treatment is the best strategy. The method of treatment is only to quickly take "Hymitol Spermatorrhea Tablets," the holy medicine for treating seminal emission, to consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves. It can achieve the special effects of sleeping and stopping seminal emission on the same night. If there are already the above-mentioned symptoms due to seminal emission and indulgence, you should also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" of strong animals to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continuous use will further promote development and adjust the metabolic function, and it will be possible to cure all symptoms in a short period of time. Taking it for a winter can increase body weight and prolong life. Patients can also come to this clinic to apply electrotherapy injections and other methods to guarantee a cure.

### The Price of Gold Plunges Like a Broken Bamboo; Further Advances to the 15,000 Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the cash black market started with a slight increase and then turned into an unprecedented decline. After reaching the 16,000 mark, it rebounded and then broke through to around the 15,000 yuan mark. People's confidence turned from firm to weary, due to rumors of a Far East peace agreement in an American telegram. Therefore, although Chenji Gold Store purchased a total of 850 taels throughout the day, the Exchange Store purchased 710 taels, the Securities House purchased 550 taels, Gonghe purchased 340 taels, and Yongcheng purchased 210 taels, sometimes He (Hong Kong gang) sold 830 taels, Yifeng and Mingfeng (Tianjin gang) sold around 400 taels, Xiangxingyong (Chaozhou gang) sold several hundred taels, Tianyuan sold 470 taels, Xiangyuyong purchased and then resold 270 taels, and Tongkangyong sold 260 taels. The market price rose from the opening price of 16,650 yuan in the morning and then plunged to a low price of 14,350 yuan in an instant. In the afternoon, the price was around 15,000 yuan, and the final price was 850 yuan lower. The price of gold ornaments rose to 1,680 yuan and then fell to a low price of 1,500 yuan, and the final price was 80 yuan lower. The black market price of silver bullion was 18 yuan.

Has Been Falling for Four Consecutive Days

The market opened at 9:00 a.m. at 9 points per tael, and the price was pushed up due to Chenji and Gonghe's strong demand, reaching 16,650 yuan, and then there were transactions. Xianghe, Meifeng, Mingfeng, Hengji, Dingsheng, Tianyuan, Decheng, and Xiangxingyong rushed to sell, and the price fell by 850 yuan in a moment, falling back to 15,800 yuan. Gonghe, Chenji, Shunyuan Exchange Merchants absorbed, and the market rose to 16,250 yuan. After 9:30, the decline intensified. Shihe, Xiangxingyong, Mingfeng, Yifeng, Hecheng, and Defu poured out, plummeting 1,900 yuan, breaking through the 16,000 and 5,000 yuan marks, and falling back to a low price of 14,350 yuan. Tianyuan and Zhongxing Exchange Merchants increased by 550 yuan, reaching 14,900 yuan. Shihe and Xianghe sold and retreated to 14,450 yuan. The market closed at 14,500 yuan. In the afternoon, the buyers pushed up the price, and the price soared. The market opened 800 yuan higher in the afternoon, at 15,300 yuan. Hengji, Tianyuan, Shihe, and Hesheng saw the high price and sold, causing the market to fall back to 14,650 yuan. Exchange Merchants, Securities House, Shunyuan, and Xiangxingyong came to absorb, and Gonghe continued to increase, soaring 80 yuan, to 15,450 yuan. Xianghe, Tianyuan, Xiangxingyong, and De sold out, and the price plummeted to 14,600 yuan, and was finally pushed up again. The market closed at 4:00 p.m. at 14,950 yuan, which was 850 yuan lower than the closing price last Saturday. It has been falling for four consecutive days, with a total drop of 4,580 yuan. There was a high and low of 1,300 yuan on that day. The price of cash gold coins sold by Jinmen City was 15,200 yuan, with a reduction of 1,000 yuan.

Gold Ornaments: 1,530 Yuan

The exchange price of gold ornaments per tael was initially raised by Datongxing and Xintongxing by 70 yuan in the morning, to 1,680 yuan. Then, it was lowered four times by 180 yuan, to 1,500 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 1,550 yuan, and the final price was 1,512 yuan (a reduction of 150 yuan), 80 yuan lower. The price of silver bullion was listed at 24 yuan without change, and the black market price was 18 yuan, slightly rising by 2 yuan.

### Black Market Exchange Rates: The Difference Between Buying and Selling is Huge; Foreign Currencies Are Becoming Increasingly Lower

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: the central and HSBC listed prices did not fluctuate. After Huashang Bank restored legitimate commercial purchases and sales of foreign exchange at HSBC and other small counters, the number of applications for conversion was scarce. Export merchants have also transferred and sold their export drafts to Huahang. Due to the lack of a decision on the new negotiations between the United States and Japan, it is still difficult to produce a formal market price for the English-American exchange black market. The demand for imports is low, and they are unwilling to drag in at high prices. At the same time, only a small amount of bullish positions are left for Chinese speculators, and they are unwilling to sell cheaply. Therefore, the difference between the supply and demand prices was huge on that day, and it was difficult to reach a deal. The market price was approximately 2.25 for English exchange and 3.375 for US dollars, the same as the price last Saturday.

Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: the prices of English and American gold pounds fell by 30 yuan along with the cash price. The price of English gold notes fell by 5 yuan. The price of US gold notes once fell to 28.5 yuan in the morning, and the final price was 29.1 yuan, which was still 9 cents lower than last week. The trend of Hong Kong notes was very soft, and the market price continued to decline. The prices of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes were both trending lower. The former fell to 2.95 yuan, and the latter fell to 3 yuan.

### Wild Plunge in Gold Prices, Sharp Drop in Yarn Prices: Shuang Ma Factory's Lowest Price at 2480 Yuan

The yarn market initially rose but then weakened, with a renewed trend of price declines. This was due to the wild plunge in gold prices, coupled with the lingering atmosphere of peace talks between the US and Japan, which caused unease and excessive panic. Speculators seized the opportunity to aggressively short sell, leading to market sluggishness. However, major players continued to struggle on the long side, and although raw materials also declined, they remained difficult to approach due to factory costs. The highest price for 20-count Shuang Ma yarn was 2725 yuan, and the lowest was 2480 yuan, a difference of 245 yuan. The afternoon opening saw further decline to 2480 yuan, but some profitable short positions were covered, pushing the price back up to 2545 yuan, then dipping again to 2500 yuan. However, the yarn and cloth situation in the exchange remained stable, with the closing price for Shuang Ma at 2512 yuan, and 2515 yuan off the exchange.

The morning opening for Shuang Ma saw reports of no progress in US-Japan negotiations, bolstering sentiment. The initial price opened high at 2630 yuan, rising directly to 2725 yuan, then slightly lower to 2655 yuan. However, the exchange's yarn and cloth opening in the second session showed consistent upward momentum, boosting sentiment and pushing prices up again to 2725 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 10:30 am, news of a sudden plunge in gold prices spread, causing panic and widespread selling, pushing prices down to 2480 yuan. The closing price recovered slightly to 2512 yuan. It is reported that the total volume of transactions in half a day was 2850 bales.

The Jin Shuang Ma futures market saw a sharp decline after a firm rise, with the overall trend remaining sluggish. The morning opening was initially strong, with stable US cotton prices leading the gold market upward. Factory orders followed suit with rapid gains, reaching above 2700 yuan. Sentiment in the yarn futures market became active, with aggressive buying from the long side, initially showing a promising trend. December opened at 2610 yuan, up 40 yuan; January opened at 2700 yuan, up 70 yuan; and February was even stronger, rising by 80 yuan to open at 2760 yuan. The initial session showed extremely strong momentum. However, by the second session, the widespread rumors of peace talks between the US and Japan caused the gold market and factory orders to experience a sharp decline. For a time, sentiment in the yarn market was uneasy, leading to widespread panic and heavy selling, especially from gold and securities firms. The market price was unstable and declined rapidly, with the near-term contract falling to 2430 yuan, the January contract to 2540 yuan, and the February contract to 2560 yuan. The speed of the decline was entirely due to market sentiment. The afternoon close saw a slight recovery of around 100 yuan. The afternoon market stabilized, with limited fluctuations. Major players remained cautious, and retail investors were less active. Contract prices for each month gradually rebounded slightly, but due to caution on both sides, trading was thin. As a result, the December contract closed at 2500 yuan, down 70 yuan; the January contract closed at 2560 yuan, also down 70 yuan; and the February contract closed at 2605 yuan, down 75 yuan. A summary is listed below:

### The Situation Creates a Bond Market

The over-the-counter bond market saw a shift from volatility to firmness yesterday, with Class C bonds briefly breaking 70 yuan, but soon falling back below that level. Sentiment was indeed strong, but the overall environment remained uncertain. The US-Japan talks continued to cause confusion and uncertainty. The goals of the talks were far apart. The bond market was suffering from the dilemma of uncertainty. As a result, trading volume decreased significantly yesterday. In the morning, Jiu Feng, Run De, and Tong Kang's buying was not strong, while Le Mao and Zhong Fu sold more. Yi Chang also had some selling. Small trades were done at 69.65 yuan, but retail buying was more active, with the afternoon close still above 70 yuan. In the afternoon, sentiment was stronger, with Xie Xing, Yuan Tong, Yi Shun Tai, and others buying, with the high price reaching 70.08 yuan. Le Mao and Zhong Fu continued to sell, and Hong Da also had some offers. The closing market was relatively stable. As a result, prices increased by one to five cents, except for Class E, which decreased slightly by two cents. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.2 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

In stock trading, 50 shares of the Star Perfume Factory were traded at 160 yuan per share.

Furthermore, the over-the-counter market outside the Public Association was particularly bleak. Opening prices were stable, but then softened. The afternoon was even quieter, with little movement in various stocks.

### Rice Arrives Frequently

Domi rice selling price slightly lower

The Public Works Bureau's foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Ming Sheng wheel arrived at the port last Saturday (the 22nd) in the evening, carrying 15,300 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the Roosevelt wharf for unloading. Taikoo Company's Po Yang wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 23rd), carrying 20,400 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. The two wheels together carried a total of 35,700 bags of foreign rice, all of which were small-grained rice from the Public Works Bureau. It is reported that the English S.S. Nord, managed by the Jardine Matheson Foreign Department, will sail directly to Rangoon today to transport rice to Shanghai. (Grandfather)

There are still no transactions of foreign rice. The source of domestic rice is gradually arriving in small batches, and the demand from shops and consumers is gradually becoming active. However, the intention of the vendors to sell is still weak due to the flat price of foreign rice. Yesterday, 170-180 bags of both northern and southern japonica rice were offered, with only the northern new japonica rice slightly tighter. Kunyou new japonica rice ranged from 182 yuan to 184 yuan, special japonica rice with bags was 198 yuan, Qingjiao special thin rice was 185 yuan, and the general market price was 182-183 yuan.

### Same Type of Vermicelli, Still Sold at Two Prices

Yesterday, the East Bund goods of foreign vermicelli continued to be popular, with the opening price of the Golden Dragon brand immediately rising by one yuan to 49 yuan. Then, with continued purchases by foreign merchants and other active retail investors, the market immediately rose to 50 yuan. West Bund Golden Dragon also showed slight activity due to inquiries from the neighborhood, but the selling price differed by 10 yuan, initially opening at 38-39 yuan to 40 yuan. However, as the market price rose, some major players sought to sell, and the northern merchants also stopped buying due to the high price, in order to suppress the price and handle it later. The market quickly turned downward, and West Bund prices fell back slightly to 37-38 yuan. Not only was it difficult for East Bund prices to continue opening at 50 yuan, but even 47-48 yuan lacked agreement. The market for live customers was slightly firmer, with Fuxin small packages ranging from 55.6 yuan to 56 yuan. Wheat was suppressed by vermicelli and rice, with Japanese factory prices having been reduced by 3-4 yuan to 72 yuan.

Ineffective Push for Coarse Grains

The market situation for coarse grains and oil cakes yesterday morning initially saw owners reconsidering their positions due to reports that the US-Japan talks had not yielded results, and new buyers also claimed to be strong. Therefore, the price of cooking oil suddenly rose by 5-10 yuan, soybeans rose by half a yuan, and corn rose by 3-5 yuan. Subsequently, due to the decline in gold prices and rumors of profit-taking, prices trended lower. As a result, there were few buyers for cooking oil, soybeans returned to flat, and corn fell by 2-3 yuan. Red sorghum and bean cakes also fell slightly. The total sales included 40 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 30 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 20 barrels of Jiangbei raw oil, 300 dan of Dayou refined oil, 200 dan of rapeseed oil, 100 dan each of Dachangxin and Taishan factory rapeseed oil, 120 barrels of Rihua factory rapeseed oil, 430 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, 100+ bags of Jiaozhou soybeans, 20 bags of Pudong Doudou, 2 carts of Mingguang red sorghum, 1000+ bags of spot corn, 300+ tons of corn futures, and 1000 pieces of Shenji bean cake.

### Sugar Also Falls With Gold and Yarn, Large Batch of Dutch Sugar Reported to Arrive

Yesterday's sugar market was affected by reports of closer US-Japan negotiations, causing market sentiment to fluctuate. Cash and cotton yarn both experienced wild plunges, and the sugar market was no exception, also trending downward. For example, the spot price of 24th grade coarse white sugar for this month opened at 243.5 yuan in the morning, gradually decreasing to 230-220 yuan, and 218-213 yuan in the afternoon. The price for October was 243-225 yuan in the morning, then 216 yuan in the afternoon. The price for September was 240-220 yuan in the morning, then 209 yuan in the afternoon. Futures opened at 249-238 yuan in the morning for the end of this month, then rose to 249 yuan, and fell back to 238 yuan. Off-exchange transactions even occurred at 219 yuan. The afternoon price was 210-212 yuan, 207 yuan, and 207.5 yuan, down 25.5 yuan from Saturday. The opening price for February 10th was 248 yuan, 237 yuan, up to 248 yuan, falling back to 237 yuan, 228 yuan in the morning, and 222-219.5 yuan, up to 223 yuan, 219 yuan in the afternoon, with the close still at 219 yuan. Hong Kong coarse sugar opened at 210-200 yuan, 195 yuan in the morning, and 190 yuan in the afternoon. Dutch red sugar opened at 195 yuan, down to 182 yuan in the morning, and 173-177 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 12 yuan. Tai B was 222-216 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 9 yuan. HX was 212-205 yuan, down 15 yuan from Friday. H red sugar was 210 yuan, down 3 yuan. The total transaction volume was over 18,000 bags of futures and over 9,000 bags of spot goods.

More sugar has arrived at the port. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng wheel arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd, carrying 500 bags of sugar from Hong Kong. Taikoo Company's Poyang wheel arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd, also carrying 500 bags of sugar from Hong Kong. The two wheels together carried 1,000 bags of sugar. It is reported that a large batch of Dutch sugar is being transported by a Java Company postal ship and is expected to arrive in the coming days.

### Sharp Fall After Cotton Cloth Rises

Yesterday's factory cloth market initially rose in the morning, but then plunged due to sluggish spot sales, a sharp fall in cash, weak sentiment, and heavy selling pressure. Butterfly brand coarse cloth opened at 99 yuan in the morning, closed at 95 yuan in the afternoon, and fluctuated between 94-95 yuan in the afternoon, down 3 yuan from last weekend. Other grades of coarse and fine cloth also fell by 1-3 yuan, and hand-dyed cloth fell by 3-5 yuan. Factory prices remained unchanged. Over 200 pieces were traded in the local market.

East cloth first rose and then fell. The closing price of the exchange's colored ball futures cloth was slightly higher, with the December contract at 88.49 yuan, down 2.51 yuan. The leading fine cloth factory orders in the spot market showed strong upward momentum in the morning, rising to 100 yuan at one point. Unexpectedly, the sharp fall in yarn prices caused sentiment to weaken, and prices decreased step by step, closing at 94 yuan in the afternoon. Later, it rebounded to 95.5 yuan, and then fell back to 94.5 yuan at the close, down 1.5 yuan from last week. The highest price for Sijunzi serge rose to 3.6 yuan, and the lowest fell to 3.35 yuan. The evening close rebounded to 3.425 yuan, down 0.04 yuan, while the supply remained tight.

### Six Exiled Monarchs in Britain

— Li Jun

The recent arrival of King George of Greece in Britain makes it seem that Britain is indeed a haven for monarchs from various countries. Today, there are more monarchs in Britain than at any other time, except for major ceremonies such as the coronation of the British monarch. Four kings: King George of Greece, King Haakon of Norway, King Peter of Yugoslavia, King Zog of Albania, and two queens: Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Charlotte of Luxembourg, have successively sought refuge from Nazi aggression in the relatively safe front line of Britain or the quiet British countryside. If the British army had not won the battle in Africa, the six monarchs might have increased to seven, and King Selassie of Abyssinia would still reside in Bath's villa, unable to return to his palace in Addis Ababa.

According to royal representatives, several exiled monarchs are gradually becoming more common in their thinking and actions. They are still leaders of their respective governments, and their orders are still obeyed by people all over the world. However, due to environmental necessities, they have gradually abolished the pomp and circumstance of the court and are living a completely civilian life. For example, King Haakon of Norway, who can be said to have been a passionate lover of drama in his own country, has found a pleasant and peaceful ideal refuge from the theaters of London after being chased by German planes throughout Norway. His figure is also often seen in London's first-class glamorous hotels.

Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands lives in the British countryside and often takes advantage of her spare time to develop her speaking talent - as the world knows - broadcasting overseas. Before the war, when she spoke to the nation on the radio, she had already felt a special talent for this work. In London, she continues her intense work, just like in the capital city of The Hague.

Young King Peter of Yugoslavia will move to Clare College, Cambridge University, to live his life as a university student, just as George VI did when he was studying at the school.

King George of Greece had been to London twice before his exile, so he is more accustomed to London life. He has expressed his sincere love for British society. In peacetime, he was a regular tennis partner with British businessmen in the Balkans. He is still the active leader of the Greek government in London.

Just like most untitled British people, several rulers wish to visit and comfort their children who are residing safely across the Atlantic. Queen Charlotte recently went to Canada to see her six children - two sons and four daughters. Crown Princess Juliana of the Netherlands and her children are also in North America.

It is worth noting that after the end of the war, the Netherlands has practiced democracy for more than three hundred years, and its traditional unity has restricted the royal family to a very small scope.

In short, there is no doubt that after they return to their countries in the future, they will implement new democratic undertakings with the valuable lessons they have learned now.

### "Hooligan"

— Meng Liu

The "elder" in the school calls Hai Xin a "hooligan", and I don't know why. It is said that Hai Xin doesn't comb his hair much, which offends the "elder", and he is therefore called a "hooligan". Whether this is the case, I am still a little doubtful; but in any case, he is called a "hooligan". In the eyes of the "elder", he may really be a "hooligan".

Hai Xin indeed does not comb his hair much, but he washes his hair often, and his hair is often kept fairly clean. Although his hair hangs over his forehead, and although his hair has never been nourished by hairspray or anything like that, what does that have to do with "hooligan"? And what is the legitimate reason to call him a "hooligan"?

I thought Hai Xin would protest this insulting name to some extent, at least a protest, ... but no, I never saw or heard it.

Hai Xin, I think he is too tolerant of insults! ... But he is a very thoughtful young man. Usually, he thinks and thinks alone. He seems very calm, but calm is his appearance, his center is still very enthusiastic.

"People call you 'hooligan', what do you think?" I couldn't help but ask him this abrupt question.

"Don't you understand?" He smiled at me slightly: "People call me 'hooligan', I don't become a 'hooligan' because of that, I am always me! If my personality, or even my whole self, is completely manipulated in the hands of others, completely out of the mouths of others, then why should I be me? If having me is harmful or even absolutely detrimental to the public, then I would be sensible enough to leave the position I occupy without the need for insults."

"Obedience is limited? Of course, I shouldn't take the path of 'hooligan' just because the word 'hooligan' comes from the mouth of the 'elder'. As for protesting, what's the point of doing that! You must know that although the word 'hooligan' is added to my title, it does not have any effect on me: it's just a trivial matter, why make a fuss! - Big problems are waiting in front of us, where do we get the time to waste on this kind of trivial matter?

"Big problems, and big problems that need to be solved as soon as possible, are waiting in front of us, so we must meet them. This requires great perseverance and strong patience to resist violence from all sides, overcome many obstacles, and endure all kinds of hardships.

The big problem concerns everything for all our national people. Many, many healthy children of the Chinese nation, use their own flesh and blood to meet them. - Yes, use their blood and flesh to meet them! ...

"Then what does the title of 'hooligan' have to do with me? Can't stand it? ... "

Hai Xin was still smiling slightly, his hair hanging over his forehead, ...

Nature

### Animals Are Not Long-Lived

— Lao Shen

In the minds of human beings, many animals are imagined to have a very long lifespan. In our country, there are still people using the unbearably vulgar names of "turtle age" and "crane year."

Since the advancement of science, the secrets of nature have gradually been discovered, and so all previous speculations cannot stand. For example, elephants have tall, clumsy, solid, and firm bodies, which can indeed be said to be a sign of longevity. In the past, it was thought that their lifespan was at least over one hundred years, but now it has been found that the average lifespan is only 40-50 years, and the highest record is only 78 years. This is in terms of elephants raised by humans. It is estimated that the lifespan of wild elephants is even less than this (almost all animals are like this.)

Turtles are more bulky and solid than elephants, and they live longer. Most of them are still able to "walk as usual, without any signs of old age" on their fiftieth and sixtieth birthdays. As for the oldest record, it has not been determined, but it will definitely not be as high as the general legend.

The true lifespan of other long-lived animals is far below past estimates. Here are a few examples at random (the old estimates are in parentheses): Eagle, 7-10 years (160); Vulture, 15-20 years (118); Golden Eagle, 18-20 years (100); Swan, 15 years (100); Goose, 16-20 years (200); Parrot, 17 years (200); Fish, 10-40 years (200).

Based on these numbers, the US Department of the Interior's Animal Management Office recently officially announced that, apart from turtles, humans can be said to be the longest-lived animals. So from now on, we can feel satisfied and no longer idly envy those ignorant animals, because even if you can live longer, but without the meaning of survival, as long as as a turtle, I'm afraid it won't be very fun.

Invention

### Traveling Paint Bucket

— Yong Yun

It is really troublesome for a painter to carry a brush and a paint bucket to paint the walls. First, he has to bend down from time to time to take paint from the bucket, and second, the paint often drips on the floor. So an American painter invented a traveling paint bucket, which is carried on the shoulder like a knapsack used in the army. There is a piston on the brush handle to control the outflow of paint. The paint is stored in the paint bucket, which can flow through the skin tube and directly reach the paint brush.

### Autumn Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Fourteen. Beating the Hero's Life

Autumn Begonia drank the soup in his bowl and nodded slightly to her.

"Then take a day off, don't go tonight!" Mei Bao said, choking.

"It doesn't matter," Autumn Begonia said to his daughter, almost always using this catchphrase. "Today that martial arts head..." Saying this, he knew he had made a mistake, and couldn't correct it in time. "... that person in charge has promised me to sing only one show, and I can come back before ten o'clock."

Fortunately, Mei Bao had never formally entered the theater and did not understand these names, so she did not hear the loopholes in his words.

"Can't you just not go?"

"It doesn't matter, singing one show can still cope with it." He said, coughing constantly: "Fortunately, I can rest tomorrow."

According to his own thoughts, as long as he didn't join the last scene of "Digging the Tiger Boat," it wouldn't be a problem; so not only did he repeatedly tell Mei Bao that it didn't matter, but even in his own heart, he thought it didn't matter.

Who knew that it would actually matter later!

As soon as the big fight started, their eight martial arts performers had to flip out of the stage door as usual. Now, although those colleagues no longer gnaw at him, some of the necessary explanations cannot be reduced for his sake; everyone went out, still doing big and small flips, really performing a big set ahead and behind.

### Origin of International Chess

— Wei Han

Ancient chess originated in the East, and because the records in various books are inconsistent, King Solomon of Judah, King Sakra of Persia, Greek philosopher Aristotle, Queen Semiramis of Assyria, and Han Xin of our country have all been considered inventors. It was originally popular in Babylon, Greece, China, Rome, Egypt, Arabia, Judea, Wales, Persia, Ireland, and India. In the eleventh century, it was reformed into today's international chess, and in the fifteenth century, it became popular throughout Europe.

In recent hundreds of years, the world's most famous international chess masters - in the eighteenth century, there were Frenchmen Medra and de la Bourdonnais, Germans Koewitz, Laasa, British Jewish expatriates Leventhal, Steinitz, Zaggado, Holwaytz, American Murphy, and Hungarian Kintsback. In the nineteenth century, there were Germans Taylor, Lasker, Linkai, Bertlyben, Austrians Michael and Weiss, Messner, Englishmen Sulard and Evans, and Russians Janovsky. In the twentieth century, there were Spaniard Capablanca and Russian Alekhine.

The earliest published chess books - one written by the Spaniard Luis Be Taissa Veira in 1561, and one compiled by the Frenchman Philidor in 1726, are extremely valuable.

The earliest established chess clubs - the London Union Society Chess Club and the Scottish Northern Chess Club, both in England.

The first chess competition - held in London in 1857, with players from all over Europe participating.

(Editor's Note) Mr. Xue Weihan and Mr. Tu Jingming created Chinese-style international chess. The chess pieces (Emperor, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Soldier, Fortress) are carved in an iconic form and have Chinese annotations. The chessboard is painted with black and white squares, and the style is novel and beautiful. A playbook is also attached to facilitate beginners. To meet the requirements of enthusiasts, it has been decided to launch it on the first day of next month, sold by Xifeng Society. We specially introduce it here.

### Famous Amateur Actor Hu Qishan

— Shi Ming

Mr. Hu Qishan, also known as the Master of Baishu Plum Blossom Hall, is a senior member of the Shanghai amateur opera circle. He specializes in the Tan school and is proficient in more than 30 operas. He has mastered the skills of singing and pronunciation. The master is proficient in Chinese studies, and any lines in the old dramas that are contrary to reason, once modified by him, are not only excellent in meaning but also in words, which is most admired by his peers. He once advocated that the reform of national drama should start with modifying the lines. It is a true insight that differs from the norm. It is said that he is currently sorting out various old drama scripts. If he is generous enough to publish them to the world in the future, then the future of national drama will undoubtedly be given a special brilliance. The left picture is a recent photo of the master as Tian Dan in the Golden Stage play. His eyes and appearance are excellent (Note that he is already in his fifties, but he looks like he is in his thirties, which can be said to be a skill in health preservation.)

### Me and "The Biography of Yang E"

— Liu Qiong

I remember that when Mr. Ruhui was preparing to write the script for "The Biography of Yang E" for "Xin Yi", he planned for me to play the role of Guo Sanguan, but when he decided on the actors before the rehearsal, I asked to change to play Emperor Yongli. But in the formal rehearsal, I didn't play any role, and instead took on the role of director, which was something I never dreamed of. The reason why I took on the role of director in this play was because Mr. Wu Yonggang went to Hong Kong, Mr. Li Pingqian was rushing to film, Mr. Fei Mu was preparing for filming work for "Minhua", plus Mr. Ruhui's encouragement, I reluctantly agreed, the so-called "no great general in Shu", I actually became a pioneer.

In these short two weeks, the entire four-act play of "The Biography of Yang E" was actually rehearsed. If the performance this time is good, it is entirely due to the script, the excellent acting skills of the actors, the rich experience, and the joint efforts of all the staff. I have too little experience and training as a director. I am bold, rash, and maybe even damage the actors and the entire play. I would like to apologize here to the playwright and all the actors and staff, and wait for strict criticism and guidance with the utmost sincerity!

### Random Notes from the Pear Garden

— Fen Yu

The rising opera stars Huang Jin Xin Jiao Xi Xiaobo and Hou Yulan started receiving guests yesterday, scheduled to perform on the 28th. Xi's opening plays are "The Lost Street Pavilion," "The Empty Fort Strategy," and "The Execution of Ma Su," while Hou will perform "Yu Tang Chun." Xi Xiaobo and his wife visited Mei Lanfang's wife at Rue Massenet the night before last.

Wang Quankui, a well-known painted-face actor from the Grand Theater, was introduced by Chen Liantao the other day and accepted Ai Yu as his apprentice at a certain Cai She restaurant. Jiang Miaoxiang officiated the incense offering, and the ceremony was quite grand.

The Fu Lian Cheng Peking Opera School in Beiping is looking for a stage director in Shanghai. Ye Shengzhang has already asked friends to help find one.

Wenwu Laosheng (civil and military old male role) Chen Xiaomu will marry Kun Dan (female role) Wang Renqiu after his contract with the Grand Theater expires next April.

Bai Jialin, Zhao Manyun, Li Duokui and others, the early performers of the New Stage, arrived safely in Beiping at 7 p.m. on the 17th. Li Duokui was humiliated by the police on the road because of his arrogant attitude.

### Blooms in a Bloody Rain

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter XIX: Twilight - The Tartar Cavalry Filled the City with Dust

His heart was ablaze, wishing he could rush to Beijing in one breath, to rescue his beloved concubine Chen Yuanyuan from the tiger's den and reunite with the undamaged beauty. Therefore, he willingly accepted Dorgon's order. Who knew that Dorgon's plan was just to use Wu Sangui's army as the vanguard for his own forces, winning without effort and reaching the Ming capital early, or eliminating Wu Sangui's forces if defeated, either way it was acceptable. He deeply resented Sangui's fame for being handsome, and after entering the pass, he only wanted to use him. Wu Sangui led his troops, closely following the rebel bandits. Having been severely defeated in this battle, the rebels' morale was shaken, and they lacked the courage to counterattack. Li Muchen then sent his subordinates Wang Zeya and Zhang Ruoqi to Wu Sangui's army to negotiate peace. Sangui angrily scolded them, saying, "The rebel Li Chuang stole my beloved concubine and killed my late emperor. If I don't avenge this, what kind of man am I! Now he wants to come and ask me for peace? How could I easily agree? Unless he returns Yuanyuan to me unharmed, there's nothing else to talk about." He drove away the envoys and pressed on even more urgently. At this time, Li Zicheng's subordinates still had an elite battalion at the rear, holding the Ao River and cutting off the bridge to block the advance. Wu Sangui ordered Ma Bao's army to construct a pontoon bridge from the front and force a crossing, while secretly sending Bai Xianzhong's army to steal across the Ao River at a shallow spot at midnight, attacking the front of the rebels. Ma Bao and Zhang Cangqiu, Chen Fei, and others advanced by the river, but the rebel generals Li Yan and Yu Huoxing defended to the death, relentlessly firing strong bows and crossbows. Many Ming soldiers were shot and fell into the water, unable to cross the river. They were locked in a stalemate for a day. At midnight, Zhang Cangqiu knew that Bai Xianzhong's army was secretly crossing at another location. If they succeeded, it wouldn't be difficult for his own front to fly across as well. Therefore, he and Chen Fei and other generals led a thousand infantry soldiers, hiding on the riverbank and waiting. (127)
