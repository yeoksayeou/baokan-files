### Churchill Delivers Speech in Washington, D.C., Elucidating the War Situation in Various Theatres, Acknowledging the Difficulties in Fighting in Two Areas, Preparing for Large-Scale Offensives in the Following Year

Washington, 26th, Havas - British Prime Minister Churchill addressed a joint session of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives this afternoon, strongly asserting that after Britain and the United States mobilize their resources, democratic countries will definitely be able to launch large-scale offensives in 1943. His speech stated, in brief, that Britain and the United States have made significant progress in converting their national industries into war industries. All the manpower and material resources of the English-speaking world must be used for the war. If we can do so, then we hope that by the end of 1942, we will have enough power to deliver a fatal blow to the Axis powers and can launch large-scale offensives in 1943. Speaking of the Far East situation, if our people still want to ask why we do not transport aircraft and various armaments to Malaya and the Dutch East Indies for reinforcements, then I can only tell you about the victories achieved by General Auchinleck, commander of our Middle East forces, in Libya, North Africa. If we were to disperse our weapons in both Libya and Malaya, the result would be that we would feel the scarcity of weapons in both theaters. If the United States has encountered some disadvantages in the Pacific, it is solely because the United States is aiding us in defending Britain and launching offensives in Libya, and because the United States is participating in the Atlantic war. This is because everything depends on the Atlantic war.

Washington, 26th, Havas - Since arriving here three days ago, British Prime Minister Churchill has held several important meetings with President Roosevelt. He also attended a joint session of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives at 6:30 PM today, delivering a historically significant speech. The galleries were packed at the time, and the envoys of various friendly nations, especially those of Latin American countries, also came to listen. Prime Minister Churchill said, "I am deeply honored to receive such a warm welcome from the members of the Senate and House of Representatives. I wish to extend my greetings to the American people on behalf of the British people. I have always been a strong advocate of the principle of 'government of the people, by the people, for the people.' The rulers of Britain and the United States are, in effect, 'public servants of the people.' I have come to America to meet with President Roosevelt and military leaders to discuss the continuation of the war. Both Houses of Parliament in Britain will definitely fully approve. I have seen everywhere in Washington filled with courageous spirit, and the American people's belief in ultimate victory can be clearly demonstrated here. I have never underestimated the strength of the Axis powers, but the British and American nations possess vast resources, and once they are developed, they will definitely succeed. Assuming that Germany had invaded Britain earlier, in June 1940, and Japan had also invaded the United States at that time, the disasters and sufferings that Britain and the United States would have suffered would have been unimaginable. At this point, the situation has completely changed. American industry is now fully engaged in war production, and its production volume will definitely be greater than what the dictatorial countries have estimated or anticipated. It is expected that by the end of 1942, Britain and the United States will be in a much better position than today, and by 1943, we will be able to launch large-scale offensives. Speaking of the Soviet troops and people, they have dealt a severe blow to the German army. At present, our Middle East forces are also strong. Heavy troops have been stationed from the Iranian capital of Tehran to the Libyan port of Benghazi in North Africa, and from the Syrian port of Aleppo to the upper reaches of the Nile in Egypt. We launched offensives in Libya after months of preparation. The war of the last six weeks has been a tough one for the enemy. We are fighting the enemy on equal footing, and this is the first time. In short, the objectives of the Allies in Libya will soon be fully achieved. Speaking of the Pacific War, many problems have arisen because we were unprepared. History will prove that the choices we have made are the correct path. At this point, we are fighting shoulder to shoulder and will make all our manpower and material resources a single unit. We will soon see the light again. In the future, we will definitely be able to unite and fight with powerful enemies to defend the freedom of mankind. This is the second time we have encountered the scourge of war. If we had taken joint measures after the end of the last war, there would not have been a new war. We must understand that this kind of disaster will not be repeated in the future. If a war breaks out in the Old World, the New World will inevitably be affected. This has become an irrefutable argument. For this reason, we must organize a kind of agency that can prevent disasters before they happen. In other words, we must be able to control the fire before it spreads to the whole world. Whether my hope can be realized depends on whether the people of Britain and the United States can work together in the future for the safety and happiness of themselves and everyone and move toward the path of justice and peace."

### The U.S. Maintains Its Previous Stance on French-Owned Islands; Hull Contacts Relevant Countries to Find Ways to Make the Free French Withdraw

Vichy, 26th, Havas - The Information Bureau recently announced that after Rear Admiral Muselier, formerly under the command of the dismissed General de Gaulle, recently led warships to forcibly occupy the French-owned islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon in southwestern Newfoundland, the U.S. government publicly and firmly expressed its dissatisfaction. Officials here were deeply gratified upon learning of this, and said that the actions of the dismissed Rear Admiral Muselier were not notified to the U.S. government in advance, and were in opposition to U.S. sentiment, which is now clear. It is now clear that this reckless act by the Free French faction is in complete conflict with the assurances repeatedly made by the Washington authorities to the French government. The most recent assurance, which is still fresh in our memory, has reiterated its commitment to maintaining the status quo of the French territories in the Western Hemisphere. The U.S. government also stated that any attempt to change the status quo of these territories would be difficult to tolerate. At this point, although this assurance has been violated, the French government, in view of the U.S. government's immediate reiteration of its position immediately after the incident, thereby proving that the Free French faction's actions were not agreed to by Britain and the U.S., still expressed its gratitude, and therefore hoped that the French territories could quickly return to their state before December 24, 1941. Washington, 27th, Havas - After Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King arrived here yesterday afternoon, he met with Secretary of State Hull for 45 minutes. It is generally believed that the two must have talked about the Free French faction's occupation of the two small islands of Saint Pierre. Afterwards, Secretary of State Hull accompanied Prime Minister Mackenzie King to the White House to pay a visit to President Roosevelt. Mackenzie declined to make a statement to the press, and Hull only said that his talks with Mackenzie were limited to issues related to the U.S. and Canada.

Washington, 27th, Havas - According to a recent broadcast from the U.S. radio station, regarding the Free French faction's occupation of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Secretary of State Hull has already begun to contact relevant countries, so that Britain, the U.S., France, and the Canadian Federation can jointly find ways to make the Free French faction withdraw from the two islands.

The Governor of Saint Pierre Island Arrested

Stockholm, Capital of Sweden, 27th, Haitong News Agency - Since the Free French troops occupied the French-owned Saint Pierre and Miquelon islands near Newfoundland, the Governor of Saint Pierre Island, de Bournat, has been arrested by the Free French troops and is currently being held on the flagship of Rear Admiral Muselier of the Free French Navy, which is docked on the island.

### Establishment of the Price Management Sub-Division, Preliminary Planning for Food Allocation, Difficulties in Providing Supplies, and Potential Suspension of Relief Efforts by Charitable Organizations Due to Fundraising Challenges

The Price Management Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council established a sub-division yesterday on the fifth floor of the Asiatic Petroleum Company Building at No. 1, The Bund, to expedite price management. The Shanghai Municipal Council is currently working on its food distribution plan in various aspects, but there are no new developments at present. The authorities continue to allocate rice flour to rice shops and bakeries. The previously unsealed stockpiled grain is sufficient to meet current needs. However, due to a shortage of both funds and rice for relief efforts, some charitable organizations are reportedly considering suspending their operations.

Preliminary Work

Since its establishment, the sub-division will follow the instructions of the general association regarding subsequent matters. Currently, there are plans to initiate a household survey, with 1,000 middle school students being mobilized to assist in the work, aiming to achieve significant results. Citizens are required to accurately fill out the survey forms when approached by the survey personnel. Any instances of false reporting or fabrication will be subject to refusal of supplies as a form of punishment, ensuring the possibility of implementing a ration-based system for distributing food and goods when necessary.

Rice Merchants' Request

Yesterday, the rice merchants' association dispatched committee member Qu Zhenhua to continue negotiations with the members of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Management Committee. Qu suggested concrete measures for rice shops to sell stockpiled foreign rice in the future. He proposed that all applications from rice shops to sell foreign rice should be carefully reviewed. Once the review is completed, they should be allowed to pay and obtain permits for delivery. However, all procedures should be meticulous and swift, otherwise, delays may disrupt the distribution of foreign rice by the rice shops. At the same time, the quantity of foreign rice allowed for sale by rice shops should be moderately increased to meet retail demand. The members of the Rice Management Committee considered Qu's suggestions to be factual and are reportedly implementing them step by step. However, rice shops must adhere to the regulations set by the committee when selling foreign rice.

Rice Supply Tomorrow According to the Datong News Agency, the Japanese authorities have permitted the unsealing of the rice stockpiles at the Bank of China warehouse on Suzhou Road and the Longmao warehouse on Chengdu Road. Originally scheduled for today, the release of rice has been postponed to tomorrow due to Sunday. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office has designated these two warehouses for supplying rice to meet the needs of various rice shops. The total quantity is estimated to be over 7,000 bags, which should be distributed in approximately three days.

Piling Up of Deaths from Freezing

Starting the night before, wind and rain lashed through the night, and yesterday it continued. The weather was extremely cold, and the number of bodies found frozen on the streets suddenly increased. The Pushan Cemetery and the Tongren Fuyuantang in the two concessions were busy all day with vehicles transporting corpses. The winter has just begun, and it is extremely worrying that the impoverished will suffer from hunger and cold, and have difficulty surviving this harsh winter. According to Pushan Cemetery, yesterday they collected and buried a total of 35 adult corpses in the morning and 42 in the afternoon. In the afternoon, they collected and buried 95 children's corpses, totaling 162, setting a new record since the beginning of winter.

Suspension of Charitable Organizations

According to the Datong News Agency's inquiries with the Federation of Charitable Organizations, the association has cancelled its plan to establish a second porridge distribution center in the western district of the French Concession due to difficulties in providing supplies. The first porridge distribution center on Gansu Road has also been closed. This center served 3,000 refugees every morning, who are now suffering from hunger. The association's annual winter relief efforts, including clothing distribution, rice distribution, shelters, and assistance to the hidden poor for returning home, have been suspended this year due to the difficult times and the difficulty in raising funds. However, the 5,000 refugees currently housed in the Ciyuan Shelter will still be maintained to the best of its ability, and will not be dismissed.

### Expansion of Jewish Registration

According to yesterday's news, Jewish people holding passports from unrecognized countries such as Poland, Latvia, Estonia, and Iraq can apply for registration at the Jewish Community Council on Laodou Road. It is said that Jewish people holding passports from unrecognized countries often cannot obtain the various conveniences of citizens of other countries. To facilitate them, the Jewish Community Council will issue registration certificates, which are said to be as valid as nationality certificates. Those who go to the council to register and obtain certificates must attach a passport photo.

### Registration of Bicycle Businesses

All bicycle factories and companies or individuals renting bicycles located in the Public Concession should register the number of their facilities and rental bicycles with the License Issuing Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Taxation Department before January 8th of next year.

### Shanghai Merchants Highly Concerned About Future Measures for Hong Kong Materials

The Hong Kong Dollar Issue is the Most Important, Hope the Remaining Rice and Grain will Still be Transported to Shanghai

Yesterday, Chinese and foreign business people in Shanghai were discussing Hong Kong affairs and eagerly awaiting the Japanese side's decision on various important economic and financial issues in Hong Kong, as these issues also affect Shanghai's commerce.

Future of the Hong Kong Dollar

Although business circles are making urgent inquiries, there is no reliable news regarding the Japanese attitude towards Hong Kong's commerce. The most important issue for Hong Kong in the future is the Hong Kong dollar. Business people in the city hope that the Japanese will allow the Hong Kong dollar to continue circulating. The financial influence of the Hong Kong dollar extends far beyond the borders of Hong Kong, and the fate of the Hong Kong dollar will have repercussions for the occupied areas of China. Less than half of the total amount of Hong Kong dollars circulates in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong dollar plays an important role in the currency of Guangdong Province, especially in Guangzhou. The Hong Kong dollar circulates in Guangzhou in parallel with the legal currency and Japanese military scrip. Many money shops in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces use the Hong Kong dollar as cash reserves. The assets of Shanghai people in Hong Kong, calculated in Hong Kong dollars, are substantial, and overseas Chinese capital is also heavily invested in Hong Kong dollars. British banks in the Far East have a very close relationship with the circulation and assets of the Hong Kong dollar.

Remaining Rice and Grain

The next issue is the large amount of materials in Hong Kong, including a large amount of rice and grain, estimated to be sufficient for Hong Kong's needs for six months. Part of it has been designated for supply to the Shanghai Municipal Council and is being shipped to Shanghai in batches. What Shanghai business circles are inquiring about is whether these relief supplies will be entirely reserved for Hong Kong, or whether some of them will be shipped to Japan, and whether Shanghai will still have the opportunity to obtain some rice and grain from Hong Kong. The next issue is the issue of many British merchant houses registered in Hong Kong, in which these merchant houses have invested heavily, and a significant portion of their commercial transactions are concluded in Hong Kong.

### Rumor that Public Buses Have Obtained Gasoline, but There is No Definite News About Future Operating Hours

An official of the Public Bus Company of the Public Concession recently stated that tomorrow (the 28th), the company's vehicles will still operate from 7:30 am to 6:30 pm, and perhaps the same on Monday of next week, but it is not certain. The extension of public bus operating hours is not due to the holiday, but because the previous three-shift system has proven to be insufficient. Regarding the rumor that the Public Bus Company has changed its three-shift system because it has newly obtained gasoline from Pudong, the official did not confirm it. However, well-informed sources believe that this rumor is true. Public Bus Company personnel also stated that the current full-day operation cannot be considered permanent, and there may be changes on Monday of next week. At the same time, there are no changes to the operation of the tramcars in the Public Concession. For the time being, the tramcars operate daily from morning to night, without interruption. In the French Concession, Route 22 buses depart from the factory in the early morning and stop operating at 9:00 pm. The operating hours of the trams in the French Concession are the same as those of the buses.

### Japanese Merchants Plan to Lease French Ships to Specialize in Loading Coal

Since the 8th of this month, shipping routes between Shanghai and foreign countries, except for Japan, have been cut off for three weeks. Yesterday, it was heard that Tongyi Shipping Company will soon have the Tongli vessel sailing to Haiphong and Saigon. Inquiries were made to the shipping industry, and it was said that the company originally planned to lease the French vessel S.S. (G.G.A. Varenne) which arrived in Shanghai on the 12th of this month, rename it Tongli, and undertake passengers and cargo back to Saigon, also stopping at Haiphong. As a result, due to the extremely small number of passengers and cargo, it is feared that it will not be possible to implement it. It is also learned that a certain Japanese merchant now intends to lease the vessel to operate between Shanghai and Qingdao, specializing in the transportation of coal. The foreign firm acting as the agent of the vessel has telegraphed its Saigon head office yesterday to inquire whether it can be leased. After the Saigon reply, it can be decided whether to return to Saigon or lease it to the Japanese merchant to operate between Shanghai and Qingdao.

### Bank Depositors Withdraw Less Money

According to banking circles yesterday, most of the recent demands for cash have been satisfied, and the accounts of many depositors have been emptied. This can be seen from the fact that fewer depositors went to the banks yesterday morning to continue withdrawing and depositing money. Banks no longer have depositors waiting in line to withdraw money. It is expected that the Japanese supervisors of British, American, and Dutch banks will make a decision on the matter of paying salaries through withdrawals next week. The committee formed by British, American, and Dutch banks two weeks ago to consider transfer and clearing matters and to consult with the Japanese side has nothing important to report. However, Citibank will handle the transfer of all salaries. Chase Bank is still in the preliminary stages of negotiating the issue of paying salaries through withdrawals, and it is doubtful whether the application for withdrawal to pay salaries will be approved.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Schedules Collection of Property Tax

The Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to start collecting the spring property tax for Western-style houses from January 1st of next year. The Shanghai Municipal Council will not send personnel to collect the tax. Residents should pay the tax to the Taxation Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council after receiving the tax payment notice. Furthermore, the tax collectors sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council will carry identification documents and attach their photos for identification. Taxpayers must pay attention when paying the tax. At the same time, the land tax for the first half of next year will also be collected and paid to the Taxation Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

### There are Currently Forty Volunteer Workers

It has been learned that there are currently about forty volunteer workers in the Shanghai Municipal Council, including more than ten foreigners, who are undertaking important tasks such as registration and do not accept any remuneration. For example, Java Company has handed over all of its staff to the Shanghai Municipal Council for work. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Control Office, which was previously located in the Shanghai Municipal Council building, moved into the sixth floor of the Asiatic Petroleum Company Building on the Outer Bund yesterday morning to work. The Shanghai Municipal Council continues to distribute food to the people, distributing rice and flour to retail stores and bakeries. The warehouses unsealed by the Japanese contain a sufficient amount of rice flour to meet the needs of the people.

### Coal Merchants Should Report Coal Sales Situation for this Year as Scheduled

The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that the Shanghai Coal Industry Association has been requested by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession Public Works Bureau's Coal Control Committee to report the detailed coal sales situation for this year. All coal merchants, whether they are members of the association or not, can obtain forms from the Shanghai Coal Industry Association at No. 405 Tianjin Road for filling out. After filling out the forms, they should be submitted to the association for review as soon as possible, no later than January 3rd. After this date, those who have not filled out the forms accurately will not be allowed to issue coal transportation permits.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Senior Staff's Monthly Salary Payments in Cash Will Be Reduced

Will Save Two Million Yuan in Cash Annually The Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Office announced that from January of next year, the monthly salary payments in cash for senior staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council will be drastically reduced. The senior staff will be divided into four categories:

Unmarried staff, married male staff, married male staff (with one child), married male staff (with two or more children). A minimum monthly compensation amount will be determined for each category. Monthly salary payments in cash less than this minimum amount will not be reduced. The minimum compensation amounts for permanent staff that will not be reduced are as follows: Unmarried staff: 1,500 yuan per month. Married male staff: 2,500 yuan per month. Married male staff with one child: 3,000 yuan per month. Married male staff with two or more children: 3,500 yuan per month. All compensation exceeding the above minimum amounts will be reduced separately according to the category in which the staff is placed.

For example, the monthly salary payment in cash for an unmarried section chief will be reduced by about 66%. A married male staff with two children whose monthly salary is 4,000 yuan will only be reduced by 4%. The above figures include the basic monthly salary and various temporary cost-of-living allowances. This plan was conceived by several senior staff members and has been approved. After implementation, the Shanghai Municipal Council will save about one million yuan in cash annually.

### Public Utility Companies Allowed to Pay Checks in Cash

To maintain the good service efficiency of various public utility companies, the Shanghai Municipal Council has approved that all bank checks signed for the services of these companies can be paid in cash by the banks. The so-called public utility companies include: (1) Shanghai Telephone Company, (2) Shanghai Power Company, (3) Shanghai Waterworks Company, (4) Shanghai Gas Company.

### Explosion in Iron Factory Shed, Eight Workers Injured

At 3:18 pm yesterday, while workers at the Maoxing Iron Factory at No. 111 Laobesheng Road in western Shanghai were working, an explosion suddenly occurred in the shed. With a loud bang, several workers nearby were injured. After the factory urgently reported to the police, the eight injured workers were taken to the hospital for treatment.

### Continuous Cold Rain, Initial Snowfall in Shanghai

For several days, the weather in Shanghai was warm as spring. However, from the day before yesterday afternoon, there was continuous cold rain, and the northerly wind howled at night, and the weather changed drastically. At 3:25 pm yesterday afternoon, snowflakes suddenly mixed in with the cold rain, and then large snowflakes danced in the sky, stopping only in the evening. This was the first snowfall in Shanghai since the beginning of winter. It is expected that the weather will become more severe today and tomorrow, and the weather may also clear up.

### Record of Robberies

At 12:00 noon yesterday, six robbers broke into No. 93, Lane 810, East-West Huade Road, four of whom were carrying guns. They robbed clothes and ornaments estimated to be worth 6,370 yuan.

Yesterday afternoon, five robbers came to No. 56, Lane 41, Kade Road, two of whom were holding pistols, and prohibited any outcry, and searched and looted at will, but the exact amount is unknown.

At about 9:00 pm the night before, a man was passing by the southern end of the Old Garbage Bridge when he was suddenly robbed of an overcoat worth more than 300 yuan by robbers ambushing there.

Yesterday afternoon, a woman was shopping at Shao Wansheng Southern Goods Store on Nanjing Road and came out with a handbag and a package, and was about to hire a rickshaw to leave when someone suddenly snatched the package from her behind. It is said that there were more than 30 yuan in cash in the handbag.

### Letter

To the Editor, According to a statement from the manager of the Pingan Changji Inn, Mr. Lai Suo, regarding the news item "Tang Zequan Recalls the Fire on Zhu Bao San Road" published in the Shen Bao on the 25th, the statements made therein do not conform to the facts. Upon investigation, our inn was a victim of the fire caused by the accumulation of fuel by the Jintai Paper Store next door. Our inn's buildings and all its property and decorations were completely destroyed by the fire, resulting in losses of hundreds of thousands of yuan, while the insurance was only 50,000 yuan, which is well known to all. When the fire first broke out, our inn immediately opened its iron doors, and firemen repeatedly came to our inn to borrow the telephone, entering and exiting from time to time, which is a verifiable fact. At the same time, the workers Han Jixiang, Yan Liangzuo, etc., dragged the water hose to the roof and carried out irrigation and rescue. This fire was extremely fierce, and although the fire brigade used all its water hoses and made every effort to surround and irrigate the fire, it could not be extinguished immediately. It can be generally known that it was not something that our inn could prevent. According to Tang, the inn was equipped with a water hose, and although it was fitted with a hose, it was never used. When asked, the tea servant replied, "The boss said that it would cost 50 taels of silver to use it." It was also said that the fire spread and the passengers repeatedly begged to open the door, but were not allowed. When the fire spread to the third floor, the inn suddenly turned off all the lights, etc. Please note that in the face of an imminent disaster, how could one consider a mere 50 taels of silver? It is extremely foolish for people to reach this point. Moreover, the shareholders and family members of our inn mostly lived inside, and they all escaped with the crowd wearing only single clothes. Who is not flesh and blood? How could we not open the iron doors and watch them being imprisoned? Judging from reason and logic, it is even more imaginable. It has been mentioned above that our inn opened the iron doors immediately upon hearing the alarm, and the firemen repeatedly came to borrow the telephone. The facts are obvious and cannot be fabricated. As for the statement that when the fire spread to the third floor, the lights went out immediately, it is clear that the lights went out automatically when the fire burned the wires. As for the passengers gathering at the entrance to inquire about the news, hindering the work of the firefighters, at the same time, the police prevented petty theft and advised the passengers not to go out casually. This is purely a matter within the scope of the authorities' administration and has nothing to do with our inn. It is inevitable that Tang and others suffered the disaster and felt resentment in their hearts, but they cannot fabricate facts to confuse the public. Moreover, at our inn's request, the local associations came forward to provide relief to the affected passengers and send them back to their hometowns, reaching 500 or 600 people. It cannot be said that we turned a blind eye to this. Now, for fear that the rumors are untrue, I implore you to send a letter to clarify, which would be greatly appreciated. Yours sincerely, Mr. Shen Bao, Lawyer Xi Shichang, December 27, 30th year.

Lost Bankbook To the Editor, Yesterday afternoon at approximately 2:00 pm, I found a bankbook with the surname Hu on the inside near the one dollar and eight jiao ticket window at the Majestic Theatre. I immediately gave it to the ticket seller at this window, and I hope that the loser will retrieve it from the theatre. I would especially appreciate it if you could publish this in one corner of your paper, so that the loser can claim it, Thank you Mr. Editor of the Shen Bao. Zhang Zhongding, December 26th.

### Business News Difficult to Eat, More Difficult to Buy Rice, Buying Rice Requires Skill

Foreign rice transactions have disappeared again. However, it is said that there are two batches of rice on the way to Nanshi and West Shanghai. If Nanshi and West Shanghai can continue to have a public sale, it will not only be a benefit to the citizens of that area, but also indirectly benefit the citizens in the concession area. However, the application for public sale, the picking up of goods, the payment of fees, and the door sales should also be improved. Otherwise, it will be sold for three days and sold for seven days, sold in the east and stopped in the west, making it impossible to figure out. Buying a "sheng" of rice a day in Shanghai, not only the so-called "small people", but now all are "three sheng small people", and they must get up before dawn, and they don't know where to buy rice today, and buying rice must have a kind of skill, that is: strong legs, able to run and stand; able to endure hunger, can be hungry from dawn to past noon; ears must be long, so that they can find out where there is rice to buy; able to withstand the front squeeze and the back squeeze, head and neck stretched forward, waist and back bent backward, legs bouncing upwards, turning the whole body into a three-part wave; front hug back, back hug front, hug as tightly as possible, regardless of filth, regardless of men and women, as long as they prevent latecomers from inserting forcefully, but still have to beware of heavy side attacks from the strong and domineering; able to withstand a punch in the head, a jab in the middle, but also to prevent a leg being sent to you conveniently, you want to fill three inches of intestines, not only three parts of the song, but also taste three records of the head; seeing the chalk number written on the sleeve, finally there is a glimmer of hope to buy rice, but there are many pranks, chalk is deliberately written on the chest above the chest, if the rice has been sold out, the iron door is closed, still the number is in vain, you want to be insulted for this three sheng of rice, or starve; the most distressed is children, want to eat, think of a full followed adults to buy rice, squeezed in the people industry, up like Mount Tai pressing on the top, the bottom two feet floating, front and rear splints up, no matter how you cry and call, who will pay attention to you, this is really called the world is as difficult to eat, the suffering eaten for selling rice, a word is difficult to say, but hope that there is a day to restore free trade, if it is to be controlled, it must improve the distribution method, yesterday rain and snow, eagerly, standing in the rain and snow, waiting for rice, still undiminished,

National rice came to the head was blocked by wind and rain, the number of shoulder vendors was small, and only thirty were reported to the market, so the market was originally soft, and then it rebounded, with late rice from about 220 yuan to 223.5 yuan, early rice was 223.4 yuan, and Kunshan glutinous rice was scarce and there was no market. The number of transactions was still nearly 100 bags.

### Western League Basketball Morning Friends Defeated Storm Yesterday

Finally, Chen You Pufu Kang scored on a foul by Fan Xirong, resulting in a score of 31 to 30. Chen You defeated Storm by one point.

### High Prices for Corn Oil and Soybeans

Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains market all saw increases. This was mainly because price controls on cooking oil were relaxed, causing sellers to be eager and prices to rise by over ten yuan. Soybeans, which were scarce and sold briskly, also rose by five or six yuan. Northern-transported corn was not quiet, leaping up three or four yuan. Across the entire market, the Great China Factory sold 200 loads of clear oil, priced at 242 to 245 yuan. Rapeseed oil sold 500 loads at 260 to 267 yuan. Tianjin's Xin Quan Yuan sold 300 packages at 100 yuan, and over 200 packages of green beans at 92 yuan. Bengbu soybeans by the truckload were priced at 95 yuan, and Jiangbei soybeans by the truckload at 94 yuan. Thirty-eight packages of Dutch white corn were priced at 49 yuan, and 100 packages of new corn from the Western District were priced at 47.5 to 48 yuan at the Western Warehouse. Corn at the Pudong Warehouse was priced at 45 to 47.5 yuan. The British-Chinese Company had over 200 tons of spot goods, priced at 78 to 80 yuan.

### Cash Soars, Foreign Currencies Also Become Stable

Cash prices surged in the black market, gradually rising after rumors subsided. Buyers emerged, raising optimism everywhere. In the morning, the initial asking price was 10,000 yuan per bar (ten taels). Certain cash shops quoted 10,200 yuan, sold to securities firms, gold shops, and banks, causing prices to continue climbing. Transactions were made at a peak of 10,850 yuan. When two silver shops began selling, prices began to decline, eventually reaching 10,400 yuan by 11:15 AM. However, cash shops and certain banks soon resumed buying, ultimately pushing prices up to 10,800 yuan. This was 800 yuan higher than the previous day, with a price difference of 650 yuan. Over 300 taels were traded. Silver shops raised the price of gold ornaments by 50 yuan per tael, listing it at 1,150 yuan (with a 200 yuan deduction for purchases). Pattern silver was listed at 16 yuan, with a black market price of slightly under 10 yuan.

The discount rate for remittances and drafts remained stable at five yuan per thousand, unchanged. The interbank lending rate of the Bankers Association remained at six percent, also stable.

The foreign currency market has stabilized. US dollar drafts went from 16 yuan to 16.3 yuan. Hong Kong drafts were bought at 3 yuan and sold at 3.3 yuan. Military currency was at 3.78 yuan.

### Remittance Clearing Notice

Due to the joint meeting of banking and financial industries deciding to abolish remittance accounts, and the Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry having transferred all remittance deposits from various banks to the clearing account on the 12th of this month, all banks in the city yesterday notified current account customers to settle any remaining remittance balances immediately or transfer them to the clearing account.

### Panic Over Public Bonds Gradually Subsides

Off-exchange trading of public bonds continued, with increased trading volume. Most transactions were still mutual settlement of purchases and sales, but there were also a few speculative buyers. With speculative funds returning to 11,000 yuan, public bond prices also stabilized slightly, less panicked than before. Class A bonds were initially traded at 58.5 yuan, with a volume of 70,000 to 80,000, later trading at 58.875 yuan, but a few transactions also occurred at 59 yuan. Class C bonds were initially traded at 55.75 yuan, then at 55 yuan. Class E bonds traded at 54.25 to 54.375 yuan. There were no transactions in Class B or D bonds, and the market opening remains unscheduled.

### Black Market for Foreign Shares Even Weaker

In the black market for foreign shares at the Public Chamber of Commerce, Wheelock Marden remained at 60 yuan, while other shares were even weaker. Ewo Cotton Mills fell to 22 to 23 yuan, and Shanghai Land Investment fell to 20 yuan. Langers was also around 20 yuan, and Shanghai Dockyards was at 16 to 17 yuan. No other news was heard.

### Eastern Cloth Market Boils Over

The top-tier mills' orders rose by 10 yuan per bolt. Yesterday, the cloth market continued to rise due to easing credit. Although transactions in the local coarse cloth were not high, spot goods were still scarce. Sixteen-pound Flower Butterfly cloth opened at 99 yuan. Due to a surge in Guan Yin table cloth prices, bids reached 100 yuan but no transactions occurred. The top-tier fine cloth mill orders in the Eastern Cloth Market opened at 71 yuan and gradually rose, closing at 81 yuan, a significant increase of 10 yuan per bolt. Demand for spot goods from top-tier mills weakened, closing at 79 yuan. Other mid- and low-grade fine cloths, purchased by the Northern and local merchants in volumes exceeding 300 packages, also rose by around 10 yuan per bolt. Flying Fish, Colored Ball, and Yang He were all trading at 75 yuan, Trumpet Five Blessings at 73 yuan, and Jumping Child at 68 yuan. The price of Calling Gentleman Drill quickly rebounded, opening at 2.55 yuan and closing at 2.8 yuan, remaining extremely tight.

### Yarn Follows Eastern Cloth Market, Rises Another 160 Yuan

The spot yarn market continues to advance, with strong momentum and a large number of attendees. This is due to good prices for Japanese cloth, boosting confidence and causing prices to rise another 160 yuan. In reality, the previous price drop was too severe, leading to a sharp rebound. Twenty-count Double Horse mill orders opened at 1,715 yuan and gradually rose to 1,850 yuan due to strong buying interest, with robust transaction volume of about 200 to 300 packages. Twenty-count Heavenly Maiden mill orders were priced at 1,830 yuan, while spot Heavenly Maiden was at 2,300 yuan. Twenty-count Moon Lute yarn was priced at 2,030 yuan, Twenty-count Immortal Peach yarn was priced at 2,250 yuan, and Twenty-count Blue Phoenix yarn was priced at 2,270 yuan. Forty-two-count Blue Phoenix thread was priced at 3,700 to 3,750 yuan. Twenty-count Double Globe mill orders were priced at 1,720 yuan.

The Gold Double Horse forward yarn market, after discussions among brokers, is expected to settle prices accordingly. One proposal is to use the closing prices of the 6th as the basis for settlement, but whether this will be implemented remains to be seen.

### Cigarettes Remain Firm, Candles Gradually Gain Traction

Cigarette prices remain firm, as there is still no confirmation of factory deliveries, and sealed goods have not been released. This has led to a greater shortage of spot goods in the market. Further rumors of increased taxes have made sellers even more reluctant to sell at lower prices, causing prices to continue to rise. British Speer is priced at 3,830 yuan, Old Knife brand at 3,650 yuan, Little Fairy brand at 2,820 yuan, Pin Hai Speer at 3,080 yuan, and Five Flowers brand at 2,730 yuan.

Match sales are slightly active, and the market is trending slightly tighter. Phoenix brand is priced at 1,440 yuan and Rose brand at 1,450 yuan. Soap sales are stable, and prices remain firm. White Xiang Mao soap is trading at 65 yuan, and Yellow Xiang Mao soap at 51 yuan. Fewer candles are being sold from bulk storage, while low-price buying is increasing, causing prices to shift from weak to firm. Sailing Ship brand is priced at 47 yuan per box.

### Longkou Vermicelli Continues to Decline Slightly by Ten Yuan

Due to competitive selling of line vermicelli, the previous market fell by thirty or forty yuan. Yesterday's market saw further declines. Longkou vermicelli was at 290 yuan, down another ten yuan. Qingdao vermicelli was at 260 yuan.

### Fragrant Sunflower Seeds Continue to Loosen

Fragrant sunflower seeds were actively traded at over 200 yuan during the tight supply period. However, since the start of the Pacific War, prices have gradually weakened. Recently, they have been even more sluggish. Yesterday's market saw higher prices at 150 yuan, and slightly lower ones at 140 yuan.

### A Heavy Snowfall Foretells a Bountiful Year

‚Äî Liao Ran

The chilling wind and rain of the other night scattered the remaining warmth. The ease of winter behaving like spring was short-lived. This morning's gloomy weather made people even more unsettled. Around noon, sleet was followed by a flurry of snow. This kind of cold and trembling season makes one realize it's finally winter.

One must prepare a gaunt frame to contend with the cold. Shelley said, "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" So the course of wind and snow is inevitable. "A heavy snowfall foretells a bountiful year." The ancients surely do not deceive us. If people are overly fond of warmth and think it is good fortune, they will soon suffer a terrible epidemic. Isn't the flu very prevalent recently?

In such a year, I think the rich also feel a bit of a chill. Heating stoves can make a room feel like spring, but coal reserves require some planning. Strolling along paths or admiring the snow in the park (and soon the plum blossoms), one will ultimately be touched by the threads of rain and blades of wind. Cars cannot start fires, and horse carriages will feel forlorn. Indulging in such refined pleasures inevitably leads to staggering.

However, I think some are ultimately blessed. If lovers have even more elegance during the wind and snow, even walking, with light and warm grey-backed fur coats and smart linings, they can find good seats in nearby "rows," and never mind "Can you drink a cup?" Raw fish and warm pots are doing well, and the Du rice coming from the suburbs is faint and reminiscent.

Those who have no feeling for "cold" and "heat" are these people. In any case, the commoners feel the solemn atmosphere of the universe for them.

A small example: Many, many ignorant people are still crying and shouting in long, winding rice-buying queues in the wind and snow. Even if there were no whips cracking around them, I think they would not be able to stand such weather. As for the small alleys and lanes that sweep across the country, it seems even less worth mentioning.

But they have to live.

### After the Cars Stopped, a Major Record of a Certain Mansion

Preparing to store the chartered car in the garage, the Chevrolet, a hero with no place to use its skills, had to be shelved and placed in the warehouse, costing 96 yuan per month in storage fees.

The chauffeur was still employed as usual, but was reassigned as the manager of the "Baby" car.

To facilitate the master's listening to storytelling, the mistress's playing mahjong, the young master's going to the ballroom, and the young mistress's going to the theater, two new-style chartered cars were purchased from the √ó√ó car dealership at a cost of 6,000 yuan in national currency per car.

Two young and strong coachmen who ran like the wind were hired at a monthly salary of 80 yuan each, with excellent food and lodging. (Huanjun)

### The Plea of the Third Type of Person

‚Äî Wu Wei

The Municipal Council recently issued a proclamation: advising landlords, in the current emergency period, to treat tenants who are experiencing economic hardship and cannot afford the burden of rent as reasonably as possible when collecting rent. To the extent possible, landlords should agree to extend the payment period for tenants or temporarily reduce the rent value; and must not force tenants to move or increase rent. At a time when the cost of living is unusually high and everyone is breathless, the millions of citizens of Shanghai are truly grateful for the fair and appropriate handling of the livelihoods of the common people by the authorities of the two concessions.

From any point of view, landlords who own rental property are in a better position than tenants: in other words, as long as landlords can sincerely understand the tenants, the tenants will never deliberately make things difficult for the landlords or cause trouble. The wise "Big Landlords" probably see this very clearly.

Here, we can no longer mention the "Second Landlords." Speaking of the Second Landlords, all those who are Third Tenants are disgusted by their snobbish arrogance. They oppress the Third Tenants in every way possible, except for a few who are more sensible. Using their "Landlord" title, they interfere with tap water, electricity, and even drying clothes and washing vegetables. As for raising rents and profiting from them, that is the specialty of some Second Landlords.

In fact, thinking back, they are just tenants, that is, tenants who should be considered by the Big Landlords. They should not be high-handed to the Third Tenants. They should set an example and understand the Third Tenants, and they should understand them as much as possible, just like the Municipal Council's proclamation. We do not want the Second Landlords to turn around and give the Third Tenants a "no understanding" or "no way to understand" after receiving the Big Landlords' understanding.

We support the Municipal Council's wise measures to provide reasonable protection for tenants. We believe that the landlords will be able to accept the authorities' advice and treat the tenants with the utmost sincerity. Finally, we cannot but appeal for the Third Tenants, hoping! Even to monitor - the Second Landlords should not continue their consistent style on us, the third type of person, while gaining the understanding of the landlords.

### 15. Daddy, Let's Go Busking!

How could a drunk person not be happy to cause trouble? He immediately jumped over like a mad tiger, aiming at Qiu Haitang, attacking with his right hand and right leg simultaneously. If Qiu Haitang hadn't dodged quickly, he would have been hit.

"Sir, don't use your hands, let's talk it over." Although the man surnamed Han was grabbed by the chest by the little fat man, he didn't struggle. He smiled apologetically and said awkwardly, "There is something to talk about, there is something to talk about!" Mei Bao was so frightened that she didn't care about her life, quickly let go of her father, and stepped forward to wrestle with the drunk Little Li. Qiu Haitang, of course, couldn't stand it even more, so he tried his best to break free from the arms of the Han family girl, rushed up, and struggled to hold Little Li's shoulder and pull him away. His intention was to separate Little Li and Mei Bao, but he used too much force. Little Li was drunk and had lost his balance, so how could he withstand the pull, and immediately fell face up to the sky.

"Okay, you guys are hitting him, saying you're not hitting people?" The little fat man shouted loudly, while slapping the man surnamed Han.

Qiu Haitang saw that he had caused trouble, so he also darkened his face and said angrily:

"Aren't you hitting people too?"

When the little fat man wanted to hit a second time, the man surnamed Han was prepared and quickly blocked it with one hand, so the actions of both sides gradually entered the stage of serious fighting.

Little Li also got up from the ground, and of course he would not spare anyone this time, and quickly fought with the Qiu Haitang father and daughter. The Han family girl held two huqins in her hands, standing at the door, not knowing what to do.

Fortunately, the waiters outside had heard the sound, and three or four people rushed in together and tried to persuade them to stop.

"No way! They dare to hit people when they come out to do business, they must go to the union!" The little fat man stood at the door, and said fiercely. At the same time, Little Li threw the bowls and dishes on the table. (291)

### Carriage Company

‚Äî Xin

Reading the advertisement for a certain dance hall seeking horse-drawn carriages in the newspaper, we can imagine that due to the ban on private cars, Shanghai needs horse-drawn carriages again at this time.

When we were young, we went to Shanghai with our family. At that time, there were more horse-drawn carriages than cars. On the road, there was the sound of hooves everywhere. The whip-wielding driver drove the horse to pull the carriage forward. At this time, horse-drawn carriages can be regarded as the main means of transportation in Shanghai.

Then, the number of cars gradually increased from a few to more than 10,000, which made horse-drawn carriages be eliminated. Nowadays, it is rare to see horse-drawn carriages on the streets of Shanghai, as if they have become antiques.

At first, although the number of horse-drawn carriages decreased quickly, we could still see a few, especially noticeable was that when people had funerals, there were always a few, or even dozens of horse-drawn carriages in the funeral procession. But in recent years, horse-drawn carriages in funeral processions have been replaced by cars, and since then, horse-drawn carriages can be regarded as extinct, and even the few carriage companies have closed their doors. Now, there is no carriage company on every street.

Some people in Shanghai are good at speculation. It is said that someone knows that after the cars are extinct, the carriage business will definitely be booming, so they want to raise funds to open a huge carriage company. However, after estimation, the problem has arisen. A horse must cost more than a thousand yuan now, and even if you have money, you can't buy it. There are not many horses left in Shanghai. In addition, most of the vehicles have been dismantled, and this group of coachmen is not easy to recruit.

### Price Increase

‚Äî February

Buyer: "The flannel shirt I bought last night was only 18 yuan, why does it cost 21 yuan to buy it today?"

Clerk: "The weather was warmer yesterday, but it's cold today, and more people are buying flannel shirts, so there's no reason not to increase the price!"

### Statistics of Amusement Parks

‚Äî Yitong

Ballrooms and Cinemas are the Most Numerous

Qingchang Small Theaters are the Fewest

According to the latest survey of entertainment venues in this city, ballrooms and cinemas are both at thirty-eight, accounting for the most, while Qingchang has only "Times" with two, and small theaters also have only "Xiao Guanghan" with two, accounting for the least. Other such as Yue opera theaters and storytelling theaters are both at fifteen, Beijing opera theaters and amusement parks are both at five, drama theaters and Shen opera theaters are both at four. In addition, there are two low-level song and dance halls. As for billiards rooms, bowling alleys (including Jai Alai courts), and dog racing tracks, etc., they are not included in the statistics because they are involved in gambling.

### The Origin of Tanhuang

‚Äî Zefu

The origin of Tanhuang is said to be in the heyday of the Qing Dynasty, when Kunqu opera was very popular. At that time, when the emperor passed away, the opera houses all stopped performing. In order to maintain their livelihoods, the performers changed Kunqu opera to Tanhuang, using only stringed instruments and no drums, so it is called Huang. However, according to the research of Mr. Li Jiarui, a modern person, this statement seems to be true and false. It is true that Tanhuang was adapted from Kunqu opera, because Kunqu opera was the only drama in China before the rise of Peking opera, but its lyrics were elegant and not easily understood by the public, so the performers changed it to vulgar vernacular for easy performance. This tune originated around the Qianlong period, because there was already this kind of Tanhuang tune in the song "Sang Nong Xian Rui" for Qianlong's birthday. The earliest Tanhuang script we see today, "Dream of the Red Chamber" Tanhuang, also claims in the preface that because the "Dream of the Red Chamber" legend cannot be popularized, it follows the old tunes, mixes in colloquial language, and makes adaptations. As for the location where Tanhuang originated, the earliest was in Suzhou, and then it spread to various places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, so today those who talk about Tanhuang can be divided into Su Tan, Shen Qu (Ben Tan), Hang Tan, Yong Tan, etc. Although their singing methods are different, their origin is actually the same.

### Lafei Theater to Perform Plays in the New Year

‚Äî Jin Gu

The play list has been decided - a three-month trial will be conducted first

After "Shang Zhi" and Shangju disbanded, Yan Jun, Xu Li, and others have entered the film industry. The rest are unable to find other jobs for the time being. Therefore, several people discussed with the front desk of Lafei Theater to perform several plays on a split-bill system starting on New Year's Day. Although Lafei is far away, they only perform daytime performances, and they still have their audience, and the front desk is empty. After several private discussions, it was decided to temporarily take three months as a period to see how the situation is and then make a decision. The first play has been decided to be "Joy Comes to the Door", a timely comedy directed by Hong Mo, starring Han Fei, Xiaofeng, Zhong Ma, Dai Yun, Zhou Qi, etc.; the one-act play "Virgin Heart" is also added in front. The plays to be performed later include "The Kissing Game", "New China Dreams", "Imperial Toufeng", "Xi Shi", etc.; and "Home", which was the most popular show at Lafei in the past, is also in the planned program, in response to the requests of past audiences who were unable to get seats.

### Blood-Rain Qiong Pa

‚Äî Gu Mingdao

Chapter Twenty: Welcoming the Wax Candles on the Battlefield

After the two were seated, the various officers and generals stepped forward one by one to offer their congratulations. After Ma Bao and Bai Xianzong paid their respects, Zhang Cangqiu, Chen Fei, Xu Jing, and Liu Yinying were introduced. According to military protocol, the four of them were all junior officers; they could not casually appear before Wu Sangui without his permission. Today, firstly, because Ma and Bai had recommended them, secondly, because Wu Sangui remembered their great contributions on the battlefield, and thirdly, because Wu Sangui was in a joyous mood, he granted them permission. The four stepped forward to pay their respects. Liu Yinying stared intently at Chen Yuanyuan, nodding secretly. Zhang Cangqiu and the others were also amazed by Yuanyuan's beauty and elegant demeanor. Unfortunately, they could not stay long, and after a moment, they excused themselves and left the tent. That day, Wu Sangui ordered a grand banquet for the entire army, celebrating the return of his beloved concubine with a day of rejoicing. At this time, his principal wife, Madam Zhang, and his other concubines were all in Shanhaiguan and had not accompanied the army. His father was already dead, and there was no one to advise him. After Zhang Cangqiu and the other three withdrew, they gathered together to discuss. Zhang Cangqiu stroked his curly beard and said to the other three, "Have you seen how beautiful Chen Yuanyuan is? I, Lao Zhang, have never seen such beauty since I was born. No wonder General Wu is so infatuated with her. Liu, my worthy brother, you are a handsome man. What do you think of such a beauty?" After speaking, he laughed heartily. Liu Yinying nodded and said, "Yuanyuan truly deserves the name of the number one beauty in Jiangnan. There is an ancient poem, 'A smile that turns back the head, a hundred charms are born, all the beauties in the six palaces lose their color,' which can be used to describe Yuanyuan. Beautiful as she is, it is a pity she married General Wu. It is a waste of a pearl in the dark." Xu Jing clapped his hands and said, "What Liu, my worthy brother, said is exactly what I think. General Wu does not prioritize national affairs. How can he be called a hero? In the past, Hongfu eloped with Li Jing, and Zhuo Wenjun devoted herself to Sima Xiangru; only then did they not disgrace themselves. Now that Yuanyuan is serving the wrong person, I feel sorry for her." Chen Fei said, "General Wu is returning to Beijing this time with the goal of regaining Yuanyuan. Now that he has gotten the pearl back, he must be satisfied. I think he should now focus on planning a grand strategy for the Ming Dynasty." (251) The full text of the novel "Blood-Rain Qiong Pa" is scheduled to be completed and published on New Year's Eve. Please pay attention, readers.
