### Advance Guard of British Forces Attacking Syria   Only Fifteen Miles from Damascus   Navy Lands on the Coast of Lebanon   Mechanized Divisions Attack Aleppo

Cairo   Military sources here announced last night that the vanguard of the British forces is now fifteen miles from Damascus. A communique stated that British forces have broken through to Sannamain, thirty miles from Damascus. It was also announced that the coastal highway in Syria, which had been damaged, has now been repaired and the Allied advance is proceeding. News from Ankara states that a division of mechanized British troops moving from Iraq towards Syria will soon reach Aleppo. It is expected that after reaching Aleppo, this division will quickly turn south to join up with the Allied forces entering Syria from Palestine. Officials here announced last night that British aircraft patrolling the skies over British ships off the Syrian coast shot down five enemy planes. A British Air Force communique also announced that enemy planes attempted to attack a British motorized transport convoy in the Sannamain area, but were pursued by British fighter planes.

Ankara   According to sources here, Allied forces departing from Iraq have advanced to the important location of Kamishli, where the Turkish and Iraqi railways cross into Syria. Well-informed sources believe the Allied forces' offensive from Iraq is extremely important and believe that once Aleppo is reached and the troops turn south, the last symbol of resistance can be expected to be eliminated. Turkey seems very satisfied with the speed of the Allied forces' advance. (Reuters, 11th)

Syrian Front   Australian troops advanced yesterday from their newly occupied base of Tyre towards Beirut, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with French forces. British warships also bombarded French forces pushed into a corner by the landing Allied forces. French mortar fire was extremely intense for a time, but the Australian troops advancing from the south have made contact with the Australian troops landing from the sea. The British attack began at 5:30 AM on Monday, when British artillery began attacking the French lines. At 8:30 AM, the Australian troops began their advance, and fighting continued constantly, with increasingly heavy covering fire from the sea, land, and air. The coastal road from Naqoura to Tyre was cleared late the previous night, allowing the advance to continue north. Although the hand-to-hand combat was very fierce, Australian casualties were light. (United Press, 11th, with the troops)

Cairo   It has been confirmed here that the British Navy has landed north of Tyre near the Litani River. This may be intended to prevent the French from bombing the coastal highway and bridges. (United Press, 11th)

Vichy   French officials admitted last night that British and "Free French" forces, despite strong French resistance, have advanced to within eighteen miles of Damascus. It was also stated that the British Navy, under the cover of fierce artillery fire, finally managed to land a small contingent of troops on the Lebanese coast. However, the French counterattacked the landing British forces, who are now being wiped out. Officials also stated that French planes and submarines attacked British ships, damaging two British destroyers. On the same day, four British aircraft were shot down in retaliatory attacks. French High Commissioner in Syria, Dentz, telegraphed Vichy last night that the British offensive deep into Syria has been contained and that the fighting yesterday was in the same positions as on Monday. (United Press, 11th)

Beirut Suffers Another Air Raid   French Air Force Arrives in Syria

Beirut   Officials announced that a French air force unit, originally stationed in North Africa, has flown to Syria after a difficult flight to reinforce the resistance in Syria. Also, on Sunday of last week, Beirut was bombed by British planes, killing ten civilians and injuring forty, mostly from shrapnel from anti-aircraft shells. However, a train outside the city was hit, killing twelve. A reporter who inspected the city of Sidon, twelve kilometers south, could hear the constant booming of artillery fire from the south. Wounded soldiers are being transported to Sidon and Beirut in an endless stream, indicating the intensity of the fighting at the front. It is reported that British forces have suffered heavy casualties along the coast, where the French have stationed their main forces in the mountains along that route. Among the British losses were ten men who were sent to sabotage transportation but were captured by French forces after getting lost near Tyre. (United Press, 11th)

Germany Elaborates on Morality and Law, Expresses Sympathy for France

Berlin   Regarding the British invasion of Syria, a semi-official German source has issued a statement expressing complete agreement with the French viewpoint. When a reporter asked the Foreign Ministry spokesman whether Germany would provide military assistance to France, the spokesman replied that France is willing to defend Syria with its own strength, and that Germany has already enabled France to do so. (Havas, 10th)

Berlin   The German Foreign Ministry stated yesterday afternoon that Germany opposes the British invasion of Syria and expresses sympathy for France. Germany believes that the Syrian issue is a matter of political morality and international law. A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated regarding the discussions between Germany and France that he was unaware of any details, or whether they concerned the political aspects of Syria. The British invasion of Syria lacks any moral or legal basis and is incomprehensible to outsiders. Britain, known for upholding the League of Nations, is now recklessly violating its resolutions and disregarding France's mandate over Syria, which is truly astonishing. Although Germany is a defeated nation, it still allows France the opportunity to protect its colonies under the terms of the armistice. The Axis powers believe that even defeated nations have the right to retain their colonies, and therefore Britain's moral and political justifications for invading Syria are nothing more than sophistry. Britain's military actions are a criminal act. The British claim that German troops have entered Syria and are using it as a base is utter nonsense. (Haitong, 11th)

### Haifa Harbor   First Air Raid   Major Oil Depot Hit

Berlin   German bombers bombed port facilities and fuel depots in Haifa last night. This was the first time German aircraft have bombed Palestine, beginning the strike against the British Mediterranean Fleet's gasoline supply. A major oil depot was hit and port facilities were destroyed. (Haitong, 11th)

London   News received today indicates that enemy aircraft bombed Haifa last night for a long period of time. Only minor damage was done to civilian property, and there were no serious losses. The number of dead and injured was also small. One enemy plane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and several others were damaged. (Reuters, 11th)

### U.S. Air Force General   Flies from Chongqing to Hong Kong

Chongqing   U.S. Air Force General Clagett, who has been inspecting air force facilities in mainland China for several weeks, completed his mission yesterday and flew to Hong Kong from here by plane. (Haitong News Agency, 11th)

### Singapore Prepares for War

Tokyo   According to Japanese travelers returning home on the Hakone Maru, Singapore is currently actively preparing for war, with trenches being dug and barbed wire being installed everywhere. Large numbers of Australian troops are landing at night and are actively training, with constant reinforcements arriving. Large numbers of aircraft have also been transported there. (Havas, 10th)

Editorial

### The Lesson of the Syrian Incident

On the morning of June 8th, Allied forces, including mechanized British troops, Free French forces, Australian troops, and Indian troops, under the cover of the British Navy and Air Force, advanced on the two states of Syria and Lebanon in three routes. Two routes attacked Damascus, the largest city in Syria, from the interior, and one route advanced along the coast to capture Beirut, the capital. Judging from the fighting of the past three days, the Allied offensive has been quite successful. The garrison troops have resisted, but not very intensely. According to the latest news, the Allied forces are reported to have approached the two cities of Damascus and Beirut, and it is rumored that another route of British troops is departing from Iraq and advancing rapidly along the Euphrates River towards the northern city of Aleppo. Judging by the situation, unless German and Italian reinforcements immediately rush to assist in the battle, the Syrian war may soon come to an end in a way that is favorable to Britain. If Hitler's failure to seize the opportunity in last month's Iraqi incident was his first mistake since launching his spring offensive this year, then the premature end to the Syrian war will be his second setback in his eastward policy.

As for Vichy, this is the initial reaction to the Petain government's acceptance of "Franco-German cooperation" and the implementation of a policy of compromise with the aggressor, and it is also the natural result of Darlan and his ilk's unwavering anti-British stance. According to news reports in recent days, although Vichy officials have expressed extreme resentment towards the British invasion, they seem to know in their hearts that this is "their own fault," and that this is the inevitable self-defense measure taken by the British side after allowing German planes to land in Syria. Therefore, even if they are silent, they are not taking any active measures. In recent days, it has been widely rumored that Weygand has refused to fight for Syria, which shows that internal opinions are very divided. If Darlan's speech in Paris on May 31st is taken as the basis for Vichy's policy, then it seems to be very aggressive, with the air of not hesitating to fight Britain. However, discerning people have long seen that this kind of scolding tone, in addition to fully exposing his personal jealousy of Britain, may not dare to take any action in reality at all. Because defeated France is already finding it difficult to maintain the status quo, let alone fight again? Moreover, those who are truly anti-British are ultimately limited to Darlan and his group of subordinates. Who dares to guarantee that the army, navy, and the general public are willing to blindly follow, and who dares to guarantee that the officials and people in overseas colonies will all agree? Because of this, although the Syrian war has already broken out, Vichy's note sent to London via Spain does not seem to have declared the existence of "hostile actions." At the same time, Ambassador to the United States Henry-Haye's remarks still express "hope that this war will only be a local incident." Darlan himself gave a radio speech yesterday, which was unexpectedly contrary to the attitude he had in his Paris speech, and his wording was very moderate. What is especially strange is that he did not mention the Syrian issue at all. His assistant, Mesny, in a statement issued in Paris a day earlier, only said: "France does not intend to automatically expand the Syrian war, but will only resist where it is attacked, in accordance with the guidelines set by Petain." From this, it can be seen that the Vichy government, which has destroyed its own wall, seems to have felt that it is in a dilemma and regrets its mistake.

Since the Syrian incident was caused by a single mistake on the part of the Vichy authorities, the Petain government should of course reflect on itself the most. It must be known that the revival of France, in any case, must still be based on the victory of the democratic countries. Darlan and his ilk may have been dazzled by Hitler's smooth sailing in the Balkans, and hastily believed that the Axis victory was in sight and that Britain was on the verge of collapse. As a result, they blindly attached themselves to the Nazis and wanted to obtain their own survival from the ruins of their old allies' defeat. As a result, not only did they lose many rights and interests, but they also completely destroyed the world's sympathy for Petain's hard work since last June. Grasping at quick success and instant benefit, what they gained was the opposite of what they wanted. Moreover, the future of the aggression front is so bleak. The Vichy authorities could have insisted on the armistice agreement and stayed out of the matter altogether. Even if they temporarily suffered some material hardship, they should not have sought temporary safety at the expense of destroying their own position. They had already made a big mistake in the Vietnam issue in the past, and now they have made a mistake in the Syrian issue. If they continue to do the same in the future, not to mention that the French mainland will become a vassal of Germany and become isolated from the world, even her so-called colonial empire may sooner or later embark on the tragic path of disintegration. This is not difficult to predict.

Moreover, from the perspective of Britain and the United States, the Syrian incident also presents a major lesson, which is that if the Syrian situation can be stabilized in a short period of time, it will fully prove the necessity of taking the initiative. Because the result of taking the initiative in combat can save a lot of time and waste of strength. If they always adopt a passive strategy of "blocking the water with earth" and allow the aggression front to run rampant, not only will the territory be vast and the troops scarce, making it impossible to defend against everything, but also, under the cover of the other side's blitzkrieg tactics, the fact is that an hour's delay can easily lose a base that could have been used for one's own purposes. If it is said that they are limited by their strength and cannot take the initiative everywhere in reality, then we cannot help but blame the United States for not being able to provide massive assistance in terms of aircraft and war equipment, whether "renting" or "lending," even though the Lend-Lease Act has been passed and implemented for several months. Are the setbacks of the democratic countries in the past and the lessons of the Near East not enough to awaken the United States?

### Counteroffensive on Guangzhou About to Begin

Hong Kong   One day at dawn, Major General Li Xuyun, director of the Political Training Department of the 7th War Zone in Shaoguan, summoned more than 20 reporters representing various newspapers and news associations to his office. According to Li's announcement, the long-rumored large-scale counteroffensive on Guangzhou will begin soon. The military authorities in Guangdong Province can be said to be sparing no effort in driving out the Japanese troops. The people of Guangzhou are even more excited after hearing another announcement. The person reporting this news was General Yu Hanmou, commander of the Guangdong War Zone. In an impassioned speech, Yu said that the goal of the Chinese army in Guangdong Province is to recover Guangzhou. He also said that the 30 million people of the province should turn their sights on the same goal. Although there is no timetable for sending large units of the Chinese army south of Shaoguan to counterattack Guangzhou, it is generally believed that "this matter will be realized soon." Although this matter was announced some time ago, no action has been seen to this day. The headquarters of the Japanese army in Guangzhou is rushing to prepare for the Chinese army's attack. It has urgently transferred some elite troops from Vietnam and Hainan Island to defend Guangzhou. It has also dispatched a full division of the Konoe Division to the city of Guangzhou. Subsequently, it has received reinforcements of 30 fighter planes and countless bombers. Finally, the Japanese army in the Guangzhou area has increased to four divisions, with more than 80,000 officers and soldiers. They waited and waited, but General Yu Hanmou never launched the attack. So the Japanese army could not wait any longer and launched a preemptive attack, occupying Huizhou and Boza. The Japanese army's occupation of the above two cities was only to destroy and seize the export goods piled up there. Most of the goods seized and destroyed by the Japanese army were tung oil, tea, and bristles. According to the trade agreement, these goods were intended to be transported to the United States and the Soviet Union. After seizing all these goods, the Japanese army withdrew from the cities.

### British Prime Minister's Report to the House of Commons on the War Situation: The Next Six Months Remain a Dangerous Period; Loss of Crete Deemed Not Crucial to the Overall Situation

London – Yesterday, the British House of Commons reconvened after the Whitsun recess to debate Britain's solo resistance against Germany and Italy, as well as how to deal with Vichy's conspiracies. Prime Minister Churchill, in closing the debate, declared that if Britain did not find itself in a worse situation in the next six months than it is today, then a glorious chapter would have already been written in British history. The House of Commons did not vote after the Prime Minister's speech and immediately adjourned. In his speech, the Prime Minister addressed the criticisms from members of the House and newspapers, stating that the manner in which this debate unfolded gave the impression of jeopardizing the government's safety, which should be a serious consideration in the national interest. Various news reports spoke of public unease and demanded detailed explanations. However, it would be wrong for the House to demand detailed explanations regarding this dangerous and widespread war, as such explanations would inevitably provide materials to the enemy. Autocratic governments are rarely subjected to the pressure of explaining their setbacks. I am different; I am merely a servant of the Crown and Parliament, and must obey the House. However, the nation has entrusted me with a significant responsibility, and I do not want its servant to be in a position detrimental to the enemy. We do not expect Hitler to appear before Parliament to explain the tragic loss of the battleship "Bismarck," nor do we hear Mussolini detailing the successive losses of his African colonies and the capture of 200,000 soldiers. If I were required to provide detailed reports on the war's progress during public debates, I believe it would be inappropriate. I have devoted my efforts to serving the country and have always been willing to inform Parliament of the war's progress in as much detail as possible. However, it is best to allow me, on behalf of the government, to choose the timing for reporting on the war situation. (Applause)

Reasons for the Failure of the Crete Campaign

There is another reason why I am reluctant to discuss the Battle of Crete: it is merely one scene in the very important and complex Middle Eastern war currently underway, and can only be regarded as a single branch or leaf. To debate only one part is insufficient to grasp the whole picture, and may even lead to misunderstandings. The battles in various parts of the Middle East are interrelated, and until we have fully understood all the gains and losses and their effects, the issue of manpower and material distribution must be studied as a whole, and should not be debated piecemeal. Milner asked why, after the British forces had occupied Crete for more than six months, they did not build more airfields and fortify them. He also said that if the German forces had occupied the island, they would have actively fortified it long ago. We must understand that if we did not have high- and low-altitude anti-aircraft guns and aircraft to defend the airfields, building many airfields on Crete would have been a universally acknowledged mistake, as it would only facilitate the landing of enemy forces brought in by air. To answer the question of why there were not more gun emplacements at the two major airfields on Crete, we must consider whether we had sufficient artillery for this purpose. The Battle of the Atlantic was underway, and many cannons intended for use on Crete had to be mounted on merchant ships to repel enemy aircraft attacks. At the same time, our domestic airfields, factories, and port cities could not, because of the Middle Eastern war, reduce the protection of their artillery when air raids were frequent. Furthermore, the materials we transported to the Middle East had to take the route around the Cape of Good Hope, which took a considerable amount of time. To support the Mediterranean war, we had already taken great risks, and we could not risk further endangering domestic security by focusing solely on strengthening the defenses of the Crete airfields without considering the overall picture. However, since the Greek government requested British forces to enter Crete, we did make efforts to defend Suda Bay, as it was an important naval base, and to develop the nearby airfield, moving various artillery positions that could be spared from other key points in the Mediterranean to this location. However, there are many islands and strategic points within the country, and if we were to fortify each one to make it safe, our strength would be dispersed, and nowhere would be truly safe. Therefore, if the House can reflect on this, it will realize that our military strength has been appropriately allocated. Facts and figures cannot be made public, so it is impossible for the House or the newspapers to make a proper judgment on this matter.

Air Superiority as a Decisive Factor

However, if anyone believes that we currently have many anti-aircraft guns and aircraft lying idle, they must be incredibly foolish. As far as anti-aircraft guns are concerned, although production has increased, every one that exists is already being used where it is needed, and those that will be produced in the future are in high demand from all sides. In March 1937, I told the House that the Germans had 1,500 mobile anti-aircraft guns, not including all their fixed anti-aircraft guns. Since then, the Germans must have rapidly increased their production and obtained more anti-aircraft guns than they needed from the countries they conquered. Our position is not the same. What Belisha has said compels me to speak. Belisha, as Secretary of State for War, was also responsible for production and supply, but during his tenure, the state of the army was truly lamentable. There was a lack of all possible supplies, especially new weapons such as anti-aircraft guns and tank guns, all of which are essential equipment for modern warfare. Today, Belisha is criticizing us for being foolish and unable to understand this. (As the Prime Minister said this, Belisha rose and interjected, saying that the British army lost its best equipment in Belgium, and that before the war, he tried to create a continental army, but Parliament and the people opposed it.) I am not discussing the equipment of the British army that went to France, but the general equipment of our army at the beginning of the war was indeed simple and insufficient. I am not shifting all the blame to Belisha, but Belisha should not speak with such harsh criticism, as it is more harmful than helpful. According to information I have received from various countries, this kind of speech has caused unease. Another question is why we do not have a stronger and larger air force in the Middle East. All I can say here is that the Battle of Britain in September and October of last year was a victory for our fighter planes. Since then, we have been continuously transporting aircraft to the Middle East along various routes and using various methods. This year, our air power has been strengthened, and we have not been hindered by a shortage of aircraft. As with anti-aircraft guns, our problem is transporting aircraft to the Eastern theater. Everyone can see how convenient it is for the German air force to move from one side of Europe to the other. They can travel along a permanent line of airfields, and where they land and refuel, there are permanent airfields with excellent facilities. Without this, the air fleet would be useless. Therefore, what the Germans can accomplish in days, we must spend weeks to accomplish. This is why German aircraft were able to quickly complete their round-trip movements from east to west when deciding to attack our country. We have been working to create the largest possible air force in the Middle East and will continue to do our best in the future. This is not about the aircraft themselves, but purely about transportation. This so-called transportation does not refer to shipping tonnage, but to the time required for transportation under the current war situation. As for how our Middle Eastern air force is allocated, this is purely the responsibility of the British Commander-in-Chief in the Middle East, but the government bears full responsibility for what he does.

Close Liaison Between Navy, Army, and Air Force

Cooperation between the Navy, Army, and Air Force has reached its peak. The Air Force Commander is stationed in Cairo, in the same office as the Commander-in-Chief. The Naval Commander is often at sea and sometimes must be stationed in Alexandria, but there is very close contact between them. It is simply nonsense to say that every problem is studied by one commander without consulting the other two. (Someone in the hall asked, "Who makes the final decision?") This is not a question of final decision-making power. As far as I know, there has never been a disagreement. The Army is clearly the main factor in the war. The Navy maintains sea power, and the Air Force assists the Army and Navy in all their work. But if a disagreement arises, it can be resolved in London within a few hours. Although the government bears full responsibility for all actions, the commanders must make decisions themselves. Besides Greece, we need aircraft in Iraq, Palestine, and Syria, as well as in the soon-to-end battles in Abyssinia. The situation in the Western Desert also needs to be considered. First, we must know the overall strength of our forces and the situation in each of the above areas, and then we can make a reasonable judgment on the allocation of our air force and the lack of sufficient air force on Crete. It is useless to make a judgment without knowing all the information, and this information cannot be made public. In March, when we decided to assist Greece in accordance with treaty obligations, this naturally exposed us to (1) attacks in the Western Desert and (2) the risk of being defeated in Greece by a numerically superior enemy if the Greeks could not fulfill their responsibilities or if the Greek army could not divide its forces to hold strategic locations. If the Greek army could not hold out, Crete would likely be the second target to be attacked. The enemy eventually used its superior air force in the area to prevent our air force from using Greek airfields and quickly used its superior anti-aircraft artillery to take over these airfields. Given the situation at the time, the enemy had a superior air force at its disposal, and its attack on Crete would certainly come from the sky. Thus, the question arose as to whether we should defend the island or abandon it without a fight. Those responsible for deciding to defend the island were all aware that our air force was limited by circumstances and could only provide very weak support to the garrison on the island and the navy outside the island. Weighing the lesser of two evils, should we abandon each key point if we could not get the necessary air support?

Firm Resistance as a Principle

Some say that if we cannot be sure of defending a place, we should not defend it. But how can we be sure how a battle will develop before it begins? If we adopt the principle of not defending what we cannot be sure of defending, will the enemy not win countless victories without having to fight? Where will we fight the enemy? What will happen if we allow the enemy to advance deeply without making them pay a heavy price? If we had not gone to Greece and tried to defend Crete, where would the German army be now? If we had abandoned this important island without a fight, would Germany not already be the master of Syria and Iraq and preparing to invade Persia? Germany has won many victories in this war and has easily crushed several major powers. The decision to defend the island was not only a matter of fighting even knowing the disadvantages, to gain time, but also a principle of firm resistance. This is what you should consider, and do not rush to adopt the idea of only defending a position after being sure of victory. The absurdity of this doctrine has been proven throughout military history. Looking at military history, it can be seen that those who have fought bravely even when outnumbered and in unfavorable circumstances are the key to ultimate victory.

Government Decision to Defend Crete

When we decided to fight for Crete, we knew that air support would be minimal. This was evident to everyone after comparing the distance between our airfields in Egypt and the enemy's airfields in Greece to Crete. I take full responsibility for this decision, but the Chief of Staff, the Defense Committee, and General Wavell not only agreed that Crete should be defended but also believed that we had a good chance of winning the battle even without air support. We all knew that the enemy's airborne attack would be massive. According to reconnaissance by British aircraft in the skies over Greek airfields, the enemy had amassed hundreds of aircraft, ready to pay any price to take Crete. And the enemy's power, once concentrated to take a point, always succeeds. It is inappropriate for some officers to broadcast war reports every week, as these officers are unaware of the decisions of the Chief of Staff or the Defense Committee, and neither the head of government nor the Chief of Staff have been able to review the content of each weekly broadcast in advance. Therefore, I believe this matter must be reconsidered. Now I will analyze the Battle of Crete. We originally hoped that 25,000 to 30,000 elite soldiers, supported by artillery and a small number of tanks, and with the help of the Greek army, would be able to destroy the enemy's paratroopers and glider landings and prevent them from using airfields and ports. The army's responsibility was to destroy the airborne enemy attack, and the navy's responsibility was to destroy the seaborne enemy attack. But time was limited. The navy, guarding the sea north of the island without sufficient air defense, would inevitably suffer heavy losses. The extent of the losses has already been announced. To what extent the navy could suffer losses was acceptable, but beyond this, the fleet guarding the sea north of the island would have to withdraw. If, before the navy's guard time or losses had reached the limit, the army had greatly blunted the enemy's airborne attack, the enemy would have to start all over again, reorganize, and, in terms of scale and casualties, it would take at least a long delay before it could make a comeback. This was the basis for our decision to defend the island. If we had abandoned the island without firing a shot, critics would have condemned it as cowardly evasion, which would have jeopardized the key to the eastern Mediterranean and endangered our traffic to Malta and our ability to block enemy traffic to Libya. This is true, as Crete is a very important point in our defense circle.

Pointless to Add Blame

The government is responsible to Parliament, selects the best generals, shows them the broad objectives of the war, gives them appropriate advice, asks them necessary questions, provides them with the greatest possible manpower and material resources, and gives them honest support when they are still entrusting them with success or failure. In the last war, there were many major battles, sometimes losing 40,000 to 50,000 people in a day's battle, up to 76,000 people, and sometimes making big mistakes. It is rare for the House not to become a source of criticizing the government. But when making major plans, we in the House must form a final opinion. Failure is painful, and explaining failure is more painful, because it has already failed, and it is pointless to explain it, and some people do not want to hear about failure, even if the explanation is reasonable. The only answer to failure is victory. If a wartime government gives the impression that it cannot ultimately win, who can bear to listen to its explanation? If the House is sure that it can get another government that can do a better job, then this government should step down. But if the government is not on a solid foundation and cannot act like a giant ship braving the wind and waves, then it will never wage war. There must be a strong united representation in the wartime government for the government to give the necessary support to the soldiers on the front lines during difficult and disappointing times. If the government has to look back to see if someone is planning to assassinate it, how can it focus its eyes on the enemy? When the House asks me to speak, there is another thing that makes me feel difficult, that is, should I arouse optimism about the outcome of a certain war, or should I prepare the people for real disappointment? From a purely British standpoint, there is no doubt that we should adopt the second path, which I have always followed, and the British are a nation that is willing to hear about adversity and know how to prepare for it. But from another standpoint, any pessimistic remarks made by the House could discourage our friends, spread panic everywhere, change the direction of neutral parties, and be used as propaganda by the enemy. At this time of fierce battle and crisis, if we make remarks that do not help with valuable criticism but can be seen by the world as a sign that the British are in a scattered and worse situation, then it will be very harmful.

Nazi Propaganda Not Worth Refuting

Australian and New Zealand soldiers are in the midst of the Middle Eastern war, which is one thing I regret. The Germans are making great propaganda about this, pointing to the British using the blood of others to fight and joking that Britain will fight until there is not a single Australian and New Zealander left. Fortunately, Australian Prime Minister Menzies spoke on Sunday and strongly condemned this propaganda. In fact, in the 1941 battles of the Western Desert, Greece, and Crete, the number of British troops was equal to the number of Australian and New Zealand troops, and the losses were heavier on the British side than on the dominion side when compared to the number of troops fighting. The number of troops on Crete was equal to each other, and the British losses were still greater. These figures include deaths, injuries, and disappearances, and Indian troops are not included. To refute German propaganda, I have instructed the Secretary of State for War to announce the numbers of troops at any time within the scope that does not hinder military intelligence. The British Marines who landed on Crete to carry out the rearguard work suffered the greatest losses, with 1,400 killed, wounded, and captured out of 2,000 who landed. More than 500 people were lost in the naval battle, and 1,300 people were lost on the warship "Hotspur." The British lost 95,000 people in the war at home and abroad, of which at least 85,000 came from the mother country. I now represent the mother country and the dominions to condemn German lies. Some ask, now that the Battle of Crete has begun, why not continue to defend the island? Now that 17,000 troops can be safely transported back to Egypt, why not send another 17,000 troops to carry out the battle on the island? We must know that since we have proven that we cannot destroy the enemy's airborne troops when the naval forces can still prevent the enemy's seaborne troops from landing, we know that Crete has been lost and we must rescue the army as much as possible. When the enemy controls the sky, it is amazing that 17,000 British troops were able to board ships and leave. We should not regret the Battle of Crete, because the battle was extremely fierce, and the German army, which has swept across Europe, has never encountered such a strong enemy. We lost 15,000 people killed, wounded, missing, and captured, and the Greeks and Cretans who fought with us are not included.

Germans Pay a Heavy Price

As for the German losses, according to our careful and accurate investigation, 5,000 German soldiers drowned at sea, and at least 12,000 were killed or wounded on the island. In addition, the Germans lost 180 fighter planes and bombers and 250 transport planes. This kind of figure is very important in the dogfight between the two sides. Some ask, are there any lessons learned from Crete that will affect the defense of the British Isles? The officers who participated in the fierce battle on Crete are now arriving here one after another. The Middle East Staff has made a detailed record, which will be handed over to the domestic staff for their research and forwarded to Sir Brooke, who commands millions of armed men in the British Isles, for his reference. When we compare what has happened on Crete with what will happen in the British Isles, there are two things in our minds: one is that the British Isles can rely on air power, and its strength is stronger than it was last autumn. It can help land defense and enable the navy to exert its power, unlike the obstruction it suffered around Crete. One is that the effort required for Germany to attack the British Isles from the sky will be more than double that applied to Crete, or it may not be within Germany's power. But we must do our best to cope with large-scale attacks from the sky and the sea, regardless of losses. We cannot be deceived by the above two views and think that we are safe. The attack of paratroopers and glider soldiers can be compared to incendiary bombs. If they are not quickly extinguished one by one, they will spread and become a disaster. We are now making various improvements in airfield defense and troop mobility. In short, we are not slackening our efforts or losing time. When I said in the House earlier that the paratroopers who landed on Crete were wearing New Zealand uniforms, it was what the Commander-in-Chief of the Central Army in the Middle East told me. Now I know that this statement is not accurate. According to the Commander-in-Chief, after the landing of paratroopers, they drove out some wounded New Zealand soldiers who could walk in a certain place, walking in front and on the left and right, causing those who saw them from a distance to have misunderstandings, and there was a rumor that the paratroopers were wearing New Zealand military uniforms. It is not wrong to use paratroopers wearing special uniforms of their own country during the war, but this kind of war will inevitably become more and more fierce, because it sneaks into the rear of the army and the civilians are immediately affected. The Prime Minister replied to the question of who decided to withdraw the air force from the Crete airfield, saying that this was decided by the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force in the Middle East on the recommendation of General Freyberg, the commander of the Allied Forces on Crete, and with the concurrence of the local fleet air force commander. The number of planes was very small, and if they were not withdrawn in time, they would all be destroyed by enemy bombing at the airfield and would not be able to help the progress of the battle at all.

Preemptive Strike in Syria

The Prime Minister then spoke about the war in Syria, saying that we have no territorial ambitions in Syria and other parts of French territory. We do not seek to acquire colonies or any kind of self-interest in this war. Our French friends should not be deceived by the words of Germany and the Vichy government, which are roaring like beasts. In fact, we will do everything we can to restore France's freedom, independence, and rights. I once wrote to General de Gaulle, the leader of Free France, stating that we will do everything we can to restore France's freedom and rights, but the French are responsible for helping to restore France's greatness. General de Gaulle is far more enthusiastic about defending French interests than the Vichy regime, and the Vichy regime's policy is completely subservient to its old enemy Germany. This has become clear and there is no doubt about it. Germany's infiltration into Syria and its conspiracy in Iraq pose a major threat to the entire eastern wing of our defense of the Nile Valley and the Suez Canal. No one needs to be a wise man to understand this. Our only choice in this regard is to encourage Free France to try to resist the invasion, or to prepare a large army, as we have done, at a greater risk of delay. We must choose one of the two. It is necessary to invade Syria with a large army and first declare the restoration of Iraq's position. We have been deliberating for some time, and our relationship with Vichy and the possibility of a complete break with the Vichy government have clearly raised the military and strategic significance of this movement to a very high point. The poison spread by Germany is spreading throughout the country, and the rebellion in Iraq may break out before the layout is completed. This enables us to take the necessary plans to curb its harm. But we are now engaged in this difficult battle, and Germany's reaction is still vague, so we cannot be happy in advance or prepare to sing triumphantly.

Those critics do not take into account the overall situation of our military strength, do not even consider time and distance, and do not consult the map a little, and clamorously advocate that we should launch an attack here now or launch an attack there now. This kind of statement is easy to make, but if the House can refrain from taking this hasty and frivolous opinion, it will be most sufficient to protect its own dignity and authority. Some say that we should not adopt a strategy of waiting for the enemy to attack and then fighting back. We must restore the initiative and import the German sense of competition and strategy into all battles. I agree with this statement more than anyone else, but it is easy to talk about it, and it is difficult to do it. Especially because the enemy has an overwhelming advantage in military strength and occupies many strategic advantages. For this reason, I never encourage the hope of a quick victory. However, if we take the other extreme and underestimate the remarkable achievements of our country and its armed forces, it is also a mistake. There are many things that we may have to be grateful for. One is that the enemy's air attack on the island has not been successful. We have consolidated our glorious position through this attack.

No Decrease in Ammunition Production

It is rumored that the production capacity of our factories is now surprisingly low. This is not true. The speed of production may not be as fast as we would like. If anyone can contribute to accelerating the method, then that person will make a great contribution to the country. But this is not just a question of sternly ordering and demanding. To make all the factories operate properly, it is not only this that can be effective. However, to say that the quantity of production is now surprisingly low is contrary to the truth. For example, the average monthly output of artillery and tanks in the first quarter of this year has been 50% higher than in the same period last year. The output in May of this year has reached the highest level ever, more than double the monthly output in the last quarter of last year. We have not been defeated by air attacks. The output of our factories has not been reduced due to the disturbances caused by air attacks and has been gradually increasing at a very high rate.

Amazing Results of Attacking Enemy Ships

The great battle of the Atlantic is now also well maintained. Hitler mentioned in January that his efforts to attack us at sea would reach their peak in May. The scale of the attack we will suffer is so great that it is beyond all imagination, and rumors abound that the Germans will attack us with hundreds of submarines and countless aircraft. This kind of rumor spread all over the world, creating a very alarming impression, which is very unfavorable to us. March and April have passed, and we are now in mid-June. Except for the serious losses suffered in the Mediterranean war, our losses in May were the lowest in a long time. We have spared no effort in transporting goods and protecting ships. This kind of effort has not failed. It is far easier to sink ships than to build them or make them pass safely through the ocean. We have recently followed the Germans and taken stronger measures to sink enemy ships. In May, we sank, detained, or scuttled no less than 257,000 tons of enemy ships, and the target given to us by the enemy may not be even one-tenth of what we gave to the enemy. This achievement can't be said not to be a very amazing fact. Enemy ships sneak across the sea under the protection of their aerial umbrellas, sailing from one port to another, and making short voyages from one port to another, while no less than 2,000 of our ships sail on the world's routes every day, or no less than 40 ships sail in dangerous areas. However, the losses we inflicted on enemy ships in May were nearly three-quarters of what the enemy inflicted on us that month. This is very relevant to maritime aggression, because the destruction of enemy tonnage is now proceeding at a very fast and very satisfactory rate. (Reuter's telegram on the 11th)

Preparation for the Imperial Conference to be Convened

London - Today Prime Minister Churchill announced the importance of convening an Imperial Conference and inviting the prime ministers of various self-governing dominions to meet in London, and said that he would warmly welcome the convening of this conference.

### As Soon as Peace is Restored in the Far East, Britain is Ready to Negotiate with China; Undersecretary Butler's Reply in the House of Commons; Standing on the Same Front as the United States to Abandon Privileges

London - Britain stands on the same front as the recent declaration by US Secretary of State Hull favoring the abandonment of extraterritorial rights in China. Today, in the House of Commons, when Undersecretary Butler was asked if Britain would support the same policy, Butler replied that Britain's policy remains as stated by the Prime Minister last July: as soon as peace is restored in the Far East, the British government will be prepared to negotiate with China to abolish extraterritorial rights, recover concessions, and amend treaties based on reciprocity and equality.

### Democracy and the Axis Cannot Coexist; Speech by the US Secretary of War

West Point, New York - Secretary of War Stimson declared to the graduating class of 1941 at West Point Military Academy last night that democratic systems and Axis systems cannot coexist in the world, and that there is no room for compromise between the two. He also stated that the Axis system runs counter to the entire history of human evolution, and therefore cannot exist permanently and will inevitably fail completely. He also warned the military academy graduates not to underestimate the crisis facing the United States, a crisis coming from well-trained troops under insane guidance. (Associated Press, 11th)

### Thailand Seeks to Improve Relations with the United States; Dispatch of Army Attaché Attracts Attention of American Political Circles

Washington - The news of the upcoming arrival of Thai Lieutenant Colonel Khun Yana (transliteration) has attracted the attention of political circles here, which believe this is sufficient to indicate the Thai government's willingness to change its recent cold attitude toward the United States. Thailand's coldness toward the United States due to its cooperation with Japan is unprecedented in a century. Officials declined to comment on the situation, but the government seems to be waiting for definite proof that Thailand is distancing itself from Japan before discussing constructive steps. The Thai Embassy stated that Lieutenant Colonel Khun Yana is expected to arrive here in July and will serve as the Army Attaché, the first time Thailand has dispatched such an official. The embassy also pointed out that Thailand's dispatch to the United States is because the United States already established an Army Attaché in Thailand months ago. The embassy also stated that its diplomats have been trying to dispel misunderstandings between the United States and Thailand in recent months, and that this is a diplomatic effort in which Lieutenant Colonel Khun Yana will be of little help. It also stated that if Japan cannot supply Thailand's needs, Thailand will be forced to rely on the United States, and Thai-US diplomatic relations will inevitably improve. (Associated Press, 11th)

### Johnson to Take Holiday Trip; To Take Up New Post in Australia in August

Washington - Former US Minister to China, now Minister to Australia, Johnson, will depart with his family tomorrow for a holiday trip to the Midwest and will go to Australia in August. This Central News Agency reporter visited him today, and he said that China, the United States, and Australia must and will cooperate more closely to occupy a major position in the South Pacific in the future. Johnson expressed great satisfaction with his new position, as Australia is located in the Far East, and he can be closer to China. Since returning to Washington last week, he has been busy submitting detailed reports, which he considers important, to Hull. He further stated that no matter where he goes, he will continue to care about China and firmly believes that China will emerge victorious from its current national crisis. (10th)

### United States Shipped Large Quantities of Raw Materials to China and Britain

Washington - It is now announced that raw materials worth 180 million pounds are being shipped by the United States to China and Britain under the Lend-Lease Act. According to defense officials, the total amount of US aid to Britain is currently about ten times that of last year. The number of aircraft shipped in the first five months of this year has increased twelvefold compared to the same period last year. The supply of ammunition has increased ninetyfold in the first four months of this year compared to the same period last year. (Reuters, 11th)

### Japanese Military and Political Leaders Hold Important Meeting; Discussing Final Attitude Towards the Dutch East Indies; Decided to Recall Entire Delegation

Tokyo - Government leaders and representatives from the High Command of National Defense met this afternoon to discuss the final attitude Japan should take regarding the deadlock in economic negotiations with the Dutch East Indies. It is difficult to know at this time what decision the government will make. According to various sources, the government will instruct Yoshizawa, the chief representative to the Dutch East Indies, and the entire Japanese delegation to withdraw from the Dutch East Indies. For the time being, no further action will be decided, so that the Dutch East Indies can reconsider its decision. The government representatives attending the meeting included Prime Minister Konoe, Interior Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Matsuoka, Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Oikawa, Cabinet Secretary General Tomita, and the heads of the Army and Navy Affairs Bureaus. Representing the High Command were Chief of the Army General Staff Sugiyama and Chief of the Navy General Staff Nagano. (Associated Press, 11th)

Tokyo - After a four-hour meeting today, the government has decided to withdraw from the economic negotiations in Batavia and will instruct Yoshizawa, the chief Japanese negotiator. The nature of the instructions will be announced later. Regarding this matter, it is understood that steps to be taken after the withdrawal from the negotiations have also been discussed from various aspects. The government had held repeated meetings during the week after receiving the Dutch East Indies' reply to Japan's final economic terms before reaching this decision. The government said that the Dutch East Indies' reply was unacceptable. (Associated Press, 11th)

Batavia - According to sources here, Yoshizawa, the leader of the Japanese trade delegation, and the Japanese Consul, met with Van Mook, the leader of the Dutch delegation, and his secretary Horst Leyton yesterday evening. It is said that the Japanese representatives requested clarification on certain clauses in the Dutch East Indies government's response to the Japanese proposals. (Reuters, 11th)

Tokyo - Today's newspapers continue to publish articles criticizing the Dutch East Indies. All major newspapers said that since the Dutch East Indies authorities are very dissatisfied with the response made to Japan's suggestions, it is meaningless for Yoshizawa, the Japanese chief representative, to remain in Batavia. The Kokumin Shimbun said that now, both the government and the public advocate taking practical and effective plans to deal with the situation caused by the Dutch East Indies authorities' insincere response. The Asahi Shimbun said that merely continuing technical negotiations with the Dutch East Indies authorities cannot resolve the difficulties, as the success of the negotiations depends on the assistance of Britain and the United States. It also said that Japan does not want to tacitly approve the stubborn attitude of the Dutch East Indies and change its plan to build a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun analyzed the plans Japan will take to deal with the situation and said that after receiving the Dutch East Indies authorities' rude reply, the Japanese government is now calmly and carefully discussing a firm policy to deal with the situation that will arise after the Japanese delegation withdraws from Batavia. It said that merely withdrawing the delegation without attaching concrete steps to deal with the new situation would be futile. (Reuters, 11th)

Tokyo - This morning's Japanese newspaper reported that yesterday's cabinet meeting decided to recall special envoy Yoshizawa Kenkichi. When Yoshizawa departs, he will point out to the Dutch East Indies authorities how serious the situation is. All opinions expressed by Japanese officials and private individuals believe that Japan needs to sever trade negotiations with the Dutch East Indies and take strong measures. (Haitong News Agency, 11th)

Berlin - Authoritative German sources said that Germans have recognized Japan's interests in the Dutch East Indies, and that negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies are in a critical state. (Associated Press, 11th)

### Canada, Under Pressure, Actually Ships Wheat to Japan

Ottawa - Conservative Party leader Manson declared in the House of Commons yesterday that Canada, under pressure from the Japanese government, has allowed Canadian wheat to be shipped to Japan. However, the Minister of Commerce declared that there have been no shipments since February. Mr. Panellay announced that three non-Canadian stores had handled the shipment of wheat to Japan. He predicted that this wheat supply to the Axis would occur. Minister of Commerce MacKinnon admitted that the Canadian Wheat Corporation of Vancouver had shipped wheat to Japan, but he said that the North American Company had reported to him that the last shipment of wheat to the East was in February, and since then, the companies have refused to ship wheat produced in North America or Canada to Japan.

### North American Aircraft Factory Strike Actually Ended; Half of Workers Resumed Work Yesterday; Aluminum Plant Strike Also Resolved

Los Angeles - The strike at the North American Aviation factory actually ended yesterday afternoon. The workers demanded that the entire army withdraw from the factory, resume work as usual, that there be no discrimination against individuals, and that they be allowed to retain union activities and negotiate the originally proposed wage increase demands. According to previous reports, Colonel Blancheau, who commands the army, said that 4,875 of the 7,000 workers had resumed work and were in good spirits, and that the record of producing ten planes a day would soon be achieved. It is reported that half of the workers resumed work today. The strike at the American Aluminum plant in Cleveland has been declared resolved by the National Defense Mediation Board in Washington. The agreement is still pending union approval. The conditions are a general wage increase for all employees. At the same time, the government should prohibit strikes in various national defense industries. The question of whether workers in this industry should continue to have the right to strike has been put to a vote by the Gallup Poll agency. The results of the response showed that 75 percent of the respondents supported the government's prohibition of strikes, and 20 percent opposed this approach. (Reuters, 11th)

Inglewood, California - Less than two days after the US Army took over the North American Aviation factory here, the strike, which affected the production of British and American aircraft worth $191,000,000, ended last night. The army inspected the workers in the factory. Of the usual 3,800 night shift workers, 3,304 resumed work last night. The workers had voted before resuming work, stating that if the army withdrew and the factory did not discriminate against strikers, they would resume work. After this decision, members of the United Automobile Workers, affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, left the meeting and entered the factory. After the workers entered the factory, the army stated that it had not reached any agreement with the strikers to continue negotiations. Colonel Blancheau, who manages the factory, asked the striking workers to issue a special communiqué, saying that it was heard that your call to return to work at this factory was due to our promise of certain conditions, including the withdrawal of the army and the adjustment of wage amounts, etc., but we have not made such promises. The workers' resumption of work is entirely voluntary. All we have promised is to give workers fair treatment and protection. The strikers declared before resuming work that wage negotiations will continue, and any adjustments will be retroactive to May 1. (Associated Press, 11th)

Washington - Undersecretary of War Patterson said that he severely condemned the obvious incitement of the Communist Party in the Inglewood strike at North American Aviation at the seat of the House Army Committee yesterday. He said that if Communist Party members have been proven guilty of inciting strikes, they should be severely punished, as we do not tolerate any action by the Communist Party that hinders our national defense program. He also said that the labor unrest was resolved, and the workers have resumed work, and the Army authorities will withdraw from this factory. According to reliable sources, the government has decided to watch labor leaders for actions that hinder national defense production. (Associated Press, 11th)

San Diego - Federal mediator Malcolm announced last night that the machinists of the American Federation of Labor have agreed to sign a contract with Consolidated Aircraft Corporation. This contract will be submitted to union members for approval on Thursday. This agreement was reached when the union voted to strike, thereby preventing a possible strike. The Consolidated factory is currently manufacturing four-engine heavy bombers for Britain and the United States. (Associated Press, 11th)

New York - The production of Allison aircraft engines in May broke all previous records. According to unofficial estimates, the three major factories produced about 3,500 engines this month. When Europe broke out in September 1939, the monthly production was only two to three hundred units. The army has now accepted a new engine weighing 103 pounds, the reduction in weight can increase the aircraft's weapon load, firepower, speed, and climbing ability. Aircraft equipped with this new engine can carry 1,500 pounds of weapons without reducing their speed. (Associated Press, 11th)

### French Associate Darlan's Broadcast Speech; Hopes to Achieve Honorable Peace; No Mention of Syrian Incident

Vichy - Associate Darlan of the Cabinet delivered a nationwide broadcast speech at 9 o'clock tonight. (Omitted above) The current government's policies have three goals: first, to improve the people's lives; second, to make the greatest efforts possible as a defeated country to prepare for a peace treaty; and third, to rebuild France's future position in the new Europe. The armistice signed last year is not a peace treaty, and the victorious country can unilaterally declare it invalid at any time. If France does not faithfully fulfill it, giving the victorious country an excuse to declare it invalid, it would be tantamount to the suicide of the French Empire. However, if we follow the armistice conditions without thinking of changing some clauses, it would be equivalent to prolonging your great suffering. Since our country has concluded an armistice with Germany, if we want to amend it, we must negotiate with Germany. Therefore, Marshal Pétain ordered me to be responsible for the negotiations. All the results of the negotiations have been reported to the Marshal for approval at any time. Germany is a victorious country, so why did it gladly accept the negotiations? The main reason is that Germany intends to rebuild the European order and knows that this cannot be achieved without the assistance of various European countries, so it restrains itself and strives to enable our country to improve its position as a defeated country. In a word, Germany wants to be sure that the French people no longer harbor a permanent hostility towards it. Consider, if Germany believed that releasing our prisoners would increase the strength of its enemies, would it generously do so to cause itself trouble? Also, if Germany believed that France was still its enemy, would it release our farmers? In short, Germany is currently fighting with third countries, and the responsibility of our government is to take this opportunity to create a favorable atmosphere so that we can establish an honorable peace with Germany in the future. Otherwise, I am afraid that France will suffer a tragic peace. All of this is not conjecture, but based on facts. As for rebuilding France's position in the new Europe, it must wait until the Franco-German peace treaty is concluded. If France loses several provinces of its mainland or important overseas colonies to participate in a broken new Europe, it would not be an honorable peace. In other words, if France cannot obtain its due position in Europe by virtue of its inherent culture, the new Europe will be difficult to sustain. (Havas, 11th)

### "Robin Moor" Assembled and Waiting for Orders; Sank in American Waters; US Officials Say They Do Not Know Why It Was Sunk; Eleven Rescued Crew Members Have Arrived in Brazil

Washington - The US Maritime Commission announced yesterday that 35 passengers on the sunken US freighter "Robin Moor" are still missing. The Maritime Commission said that it had confirmed the news from the "Robin Moor" shipowner that eleven passengers had been rescued in Brazil. It also said that the captain of the Brazilian ship "Vassouro Liao" had informed the "Robin Moor" owner that the American ship was torpedoed on May 21, 950 miles northeast of Cape St. Roque, Brazil. The "Vassouro Liao" rescued ten crew members and one passenger. These rescued crew members landed in Pernambuco yesterday. There is still no news of the remaining 35 passengers. A spokesman for the "Robin Moor" said that the "Robin Moor" could not be mistaken for a ship of a belligerent country. Both sides of the ship were painted with huge American flags, and the American flag was constantly illuminated by a huge searchlight. He also said that the ship was absolutely law-abiding and did not carry any contraband. White House Secretary O'Leary said that it is believed that the ship sank in American waters in this Atlantic Ocean, but it is not known why the ship was sunk. We are trying to determine this. The ship's location seems very easy to know, as it is in the American waters of the Atlantic Ocean. US Ambassador to Brazil Caffery reported to the State Department from Rio de Janeiro that some people said that the "Robin Moor" was torpedoed halfway between Brazil and West Africa. The Navy Department had previously announced that someone had told the department that a German submarine had torpedoed the ship. (Associated Press, 11th) Pernambuco, Brazil - The Brazilian ship "Vassouro Liao," which rescued some of the crew members of the American ship "Robin Moor," which was torpedoed in Brazilian waters on May 21, sent a radio message yesterday saying that the ship would arrive here at 11 p.m. today. William, the American Vice-Consul in Rio de Janeiro, will take the opportunity to arrive here to assist the American Consul in taking care of the victims. (Associated Press, 11th)

Recife, Brazil - It is now believed here that the rescued personnel of the American ship Robin Moor, which was torpedoed in Brazilian waters on May 21, were obviously under orders from the American government not to make any statements until they arrived in Rio de Janeiro. It has not been clarified whether the American message sent to the eleven rescued personnel on the Brazilian ship "Vassouro Liao" has been received. It is believed that these people are obviously under orders from the American government to remain silent. Other Brazilian ships near the Vassouro Liao" also found three or four lifeboats at sea, but were unable to find any other lifeboats. (Associated Press, 11th)

### Diplomatic Envoys of Various Countries in Paris Move to Vichy

Paris - Diplomatic delegations from 36 countries and their families, totaling 2,000 people, are now withdrawing from Paris and moving to Vichy. This is at the request of Germany, because the French government is now located in Vichy, not in Paris, so diplomats from various countries should be stationed in Vichy. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)

Paris - After the diplomatic envoys of various countries withdrew from Paris, the consuls of various countries here unanimously elected Hungarian Consul Bender as the chief consul of the consular corps to contact the German authorities on matters related to the consulates of various countries. (Havas, 10th)

### Soviet Navy Conducts Tactical Exercises

Moscow - Initiated by the personnel of the Soviet Navy destroyer "Gordi," a maritime technology competition was held. The personnel of the ship suggested convening a meeting to discuss maritime technology, exchange naval warfare knowledge, and improve methods and weapons of maritime warfare. This suggestion has been warmly received by the various fleets of the Soviet Red Navy and unanimously participated. Currently, the Soviet Pacific, Black Sea, Danube River, and Heilongjiang fleets are fiercely competing in order to acquire modern new maritime warfare technology. Also, the chairman of the Soviet National Defense Aviation and Chemical Association will convene a national conference on July 15 to discuss emergency tasks and review the association's regulations.

### Mussolini Claims: Not Afraid of US Entry into War; If Germany and Italy Suffer New Attacks, Japan Will Not Ignore It

Rome. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech at the Fascist Trade Union Conference yesterday, lasting for an hour, in which he addressed the military and political situation.

Territorial Division of Greece

Regarding the division of the Balkans, Mussolini stated that Bulgaria would obtain Macedonia and the western part of Thrace, Albania would obtain Kosovo and Chameria, Montenegro would declare independence, and the people in Yugoslavia bordering Italy would be exchanged. Greece would be incorporated into Italian territory.

Strengthened Cooperation Among the Three Allied Nations

Regarding diplomatic and political events, Mussolini stated that the cooperation among the signatories of the Tripartite Pact, especially between Germany and Italy, had been effective. "I can solemnly inform you that our joint operations and common progress will surely achieve a common victory. The friendship between our armies will further develop into friendship between our peoples. The German leader recently acknowledged in his speech the blood and flesh sacrifices made by Italy for the Axis movement. Therefore, rumors of friction and the irrational fallacies of British Prime Minister Churchill have now been refuted without being attacked. The joint actions of the two peoples will continue unabated after the victory. Japan's attitude is also fully in line with the outline of the Tripartite Pact, as can be seen from the talks given by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in Rome and recently in Tokyo. The loyalty of the Japanese people will not ignore an American attack on the Axis powers. Japan should know that its fate is also in danger. Although our country is far from Japan, our relationship with Japan is increasingly 'sincere.' The Japanese military delegation is currently in Italy for inspection and will surely recognize the sincerity of Fascist Italy's sympathy for Japan."

Spain's Policy: Let It Decide

In addition, our country maintains the most friendly relations with Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and other signatories of the Tripartite Pact. Regarding countries that have not yet been involved in the war, Spain must be mentioned. Spain will not give up the opportunity to redress past injustices. Our country has not pressured it to make any decisions. This matter must be decided by its responsible authorities themselves. We believe that Spain will be able to clearly distinguish between friends and enemies. Spain's destiny is now in the hands of the Falange Party and cannot cooperate with plutocratic politics or Jewish organizations, as they support the Red elements in an attempt to obstruct General Franco from realizing his national movement.

Seeking Understanding with Turkey

Regarding Turkey, that country has now rejected Britain's warnings. President İsmet has recognized the fact that any country that trusts Britain will ultimately encounter tragedy. I would like to take this opportunity to solemnly inform the President of Turkey that Italy is willing to adopt a policy of understanding towards Turkey and continue to maintain the cooperative relationship that began in 1928. Spain and Turkey are now both standing aside.

American Aid to Britain Is Too Late

But one country in the Americas will now be drawn into the war. It should be known that some actions by the United States will not cause much difficulty. Even a formal declaration of war will not change the current war situation. Even if the United States expands its scope of intervention, it is now too late. How can it affect the war situation? American intervention cannot give Britain victory but can only prolong the war. It cannot limit the scope of the war but will expand it to other oceans. The result will be that the United States will form a totalitarian regime, to a greater extent than the advanced countries of Fascism and National Socialism. (Haitong Telegram, 11th)

Heavy Casualties in the Greek Campaign

The Prime Minister also stated that in the Italian-Greek war, 13,501 Italian soldiers were killed, including 1,518 Blackshirts, and 38,768 were wounded, including 3,212 Blackshirts. (United Press Telegram, 11th)

### Increase in Fares for Public Vehicles: Municipal Council Still Studying

Failed to pass at yesterday's meeting. No decision made on salary increases for staff.

It was widely rumored that the Municipal Council would pass the proposed increase in fares for public vehicles within the Public Concession and the salary increases for the Council's staff at its regular meeting yesterday afternoon. This claim has proven to be inaccurate, as according to a Council spokesperson, neither of these matters was passed at yesterday's meeting and is still under study. The proposal to increase fares for public vehicles, namely buses and trams, was put forward by the Public Utilities Committee at its meeting on Monday. The fare increase is approximately 50%. The reason given by the bus company and tram company for the increase is the sharp rise in the price of goods, which necessitates an increase in revenue.

Public Eager to Reduce Burden

After the British-owned China General Omnibus Company proposed to increase passenger fares, the company submitted the drafted fare table for each route stop to the Municipal Council's Public Utilities Committee for review. However, as this matter concerns public transportation, residents from all walks of life have unanimously and firmly expressed their opposition and appealed to the authorities to handle it carefully and appropriately in order to reduce the public burden. Therefore, it is currently difficult to implement. The general public also hopes that the company will not simply address the symptoms but will start by rectifying its operations to increase the company's revenue.

### Shanghai Factory Registration: Chamber of Commerce Certification

Factories Not Registered Will Not Be Eligible for National Goods Certification

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's office in Hong Kong received a notice from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that the current Factory Registration Rules have been amended and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and record. It was also announced by the Ministry on March 25 for implementation. According to Article 2 of the amended rules, factories should fill out a registration form and submit it to the Ministry for registration. However, due to the special circumstances in Shanghai, the registration forms filled out by the factories should be sent to the Chamber of Commerce for verification to ensure accuracy and that there is no misuse before being submitted to the Ministry for review to ensure carefulness. The key points of the amended Factory Registration Rules are as follows: Article 1: All factories within the Republic of China, except for military ones, that meet one of the following conditions shall apply for registration in accordance with these rules: (1) Paid-up capital of more than 10,000 yuan; (2) Employing more than 30 workers on a regular basis; (3) Using mechanical power to manufacture products. Article 2: When a factory is established, the factory owner or manager should fill out a registration form within one month after the start of operations and submit it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for registration. The same applies when establishing a branch factory. Article 3: Any business engaged in manufacturing that has the characteristics of a factory, regardless of whether it uses the name of a factory, shall still be registered as a factory in addition to registering in accordance with other laws and regulations. Article 10: Factories that have not been approved for registration shall not be eligible for government interest guarantees, subsidies, loans, national goods certification, and other awards and assistance. Note: The stamp duty stipulated in these rules should be two national currency yuan according to the Provisional Measures for the Collection of Stamp Duty during the Extraordinary Period.

### Although Rice Prices Are Gradually Being Suppressed, Labor Unrest Has Not Yet Been Contained

If Public Utility Workers' Demands Can Be Discussed in Good Faith, the Issues Can Be Resolved

Since the Municipal Council released harbor rice, labor unrest in various industries had been gradually subsiding. However, various unresolved labor disputes have been delayed, and labor disputes have arisen again in various public utility institutions, which is quite surprising.

Waterworks

More than a hundred workers at the Yangshupu Waterworks requested a rice subsidy at the beginning of last month. A foreman tried to stop them, which led to a conflict. As a result, the foreman was injured. The company agreed to change the monthly subsidy of 45 yuan to five dou of Municipal Council harbor rice. Afterwards, the company ordered the workers to compensate the foreman for medical expenses, but the workers refused. The company then fired three workers, and the workers went on strike on the first of this month.

Successive Strikes

More than a hundred workers repairing water pipes on Jiangxi Road (who belong to the same department as the Yangshupu workers) went on strike, because the company canceled the daily rice subsidy of 25 cents, which was given when rice prices were high. At the same time, three employees, Bai Zhao and Chen, were fired, which aroused labor's disagreement. They also went on strike starting from the 4th. Currently, the total number of striking workers in the two strikes is about 200. The repair work on large and small water pipes on the roads is partially paralyzed. Only the workers hired by the Xinzha Road Company are still working as usual.

Demands Made

It is found that the above-mentioned workers are all temporary hires, and their wages are calculated based on the number of days worked. Their income is relatively low. After the outbreak of this labor unrest, labor presented six demands on the 7th of the same month: (1) Requesting an increase in the allowance of one yuan per worker; (2) Wages to be paid for Sundays and holidays; (3) Requesting the company to hire 30 long-term workers (10 each for Yangshupu Company, Jiangxi Road Company, and Xinzha Road Company), one foreman, and temporary workers to be assigned work by the foreman; (4) Wages to be paid during the strike period; (5) One month's vacation per year; (6) Requesting reinstatement of the six fired workers. The company has not yet responded to the demands. Regarding the rice subsidy issue, it is willing to reduce it by five cents per day per person and pay two cents. However, labor has abandoned the rice subsidy issue and made other demands. Currently, the two sides are still at odds. Starting yesterday, some warehouse staff on Jiangxi Road also did not go to the company to work. The situation is quite stiff.

No Worries About Water Supply

Yesterday, the company indicated that regardless of the labor unrest situation, the supply of tap water to the city would not be affected in any way. According to labor, although rice prices have been stopped from rising due to the Municipal Council's purchase of harbor rice for supply, other prices are still high. Taking tap water as an example, prices have only increased and have not been reduced. The company should not ignore the actual difficulties in the workers' lives.

Telephone Company

Hundreds of workers at the Metropole Road Telephone Company, affected by high rice prices and living costs, jointly submitted 11 conditions to the company the day before yesterday, including (1) Reinstating the dismissed employees; (2) Requesting a general wage increase (A) 50% increase for those earning less than 50 yuan; (B) 30% increase for those earning less than 100 yuan; C) 20% increase for those earning more than 100 yuan; (3) Rice subsidy calculated at one regulation per person (converted at the market price on the 25th of each month); (4) Workers on sick leave with a doctor's certificate to be paid wages as usual; (5) Workers working during holidays to be paid double wages; (6) All employees to be insured for life insurance at the company's expense; (7) Employees injured or disabled or killed on duty to be provided with long-term job security and compensation or medicine supply by the company; (8) Outdoor workers to be issued raincoats and long galoshes; (9) The company shall not dismiss employees without reason; (10) Electrical company workers to be treated the same as telephone company workers; (11) A deadline for a satisfactory response this morning.

Gas Company

A labor unrest once occurred last year at the main plant of the Chaqiao Road Gas Company and the new plant in Yangshupu. Now, because the company has reduced salaries, the workers at the two plants are extremely uneasy after hearing the news. In addition to petitioning the Municipal Council and relevant parties for assistance, all workers held discussions yesterday afternoon to discuss how to respond.

Moller Shipyard

Workers in all departments of the British-owned Moller Shipyard in Gaomiao, Pudong, went on strike on the 7th of this month. Labor-management negotiations have yielded no results for days. It is found that the factory was founded by Moller. Before the Sino-Japanese Incident, there were only a dozen or so small tugboats and barges (commonly known as "tang zi boats") transporting goods for customers. A shipyard was set up near Dinghai Bridge in Pudong, specializing in repairing the company's small boats with only dozens of workers and no dock. After the incident, the company actively added boats, sailing to various ports, and business developed rapidly, showing a trend of rapid growth. Now the number of large and small boats has increased to more than 70. Therefore, a larger shipyard was built east of Qingning Temple in Gaomiao, named Moller Shipyard, with about 600 workers in various departments, plus contractors for cold work, totaling more than 1,000 workers.

Cause of the Strike

At the end of last month, Shen Akang, a carpenter in the factory, fell to his death from a high place while working. The foreman, seeing Shen's tragic death, asked the factory for generous compensation the next day, but received no response after three days. The workers in the department started a slowdown on the 3rd of this month to prompt the company to realize the situation. That afternoon, other workers went to work as usual. Also, because of rumors of someone collecting workers, the workers ran around telling each other, and all avoided. Later, because it turned out to be a misunderstanding, they still gradually entered the factory, but the time was over, and they were suddenly rejected by the Indian police, which aroused the workers' anger, unanimously sympathizing with and helping the workers in the carpentry department, and went on strike together starting from the 7th.

Conditions Requested

The workers elected 22 representatives and put forward eight conditions, and one additional note, namely (1) If a worker dies on duty, two years' salary must be given, paid in one lump sum, and workers injured on duty must be given full daily wages; (2) The factory must be equipped with doctors and all medicines for emergencies and first aid; (3) Please have the factory acknowledge the workers' representatives to negotiate all matters; (4) Workers working on Sundays must be given double wages, and those resting must be given rice subsidies and allowances; (5) The factory shall not dismiss workers without reason; (6) Allowances must be increased by 40%; (7) The factory should prepare a savings fund in accordance with labor regulations, and year-end bonuses should be given according to the writing room; (8) Night work must be the same as daytime earnings, and wages must be paid on a fixed date every month; (Note) Wages and allowances must be paid during the slowdown period. It is heard that as a result of the negotiations, the factory must dismiss five workers' representatives, which labor absolutely denies, resulting in no results.

Commercial Press Labor Unrest

Since the labor at the Commercial Press jointly formed a temporary joint committee of colleagues a hundred days ago and submitted six specific conditions to the company, the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council again summoned labor representatives for talks at 10 am yesterday. The preliminary conditions have been transferred to the company. I have just received a cable from Wang Yunwu from Hong Kong, answering each point raised.

The Hong Kong Side's Attitude

Only agreeing to increase the so-called "non-renewal preferential treatment bonus" by one month, that is, those who have not yet made up for seven months of discounted salary will be made up for seven months. The representatives felt that the difference was still too great and it was difficult to agree. They also asked for a detailed analysis and response to the six conditions raised, and it was best to still hope to have a direct face-to-face meeting with the company. At 4 pm, the representatives visited the Industrial Section again, and Gu Bingyuan received them, saying that the general opinions requested in the morning had been forwarded to the company. According to the company, the general manager Lai San has clearly stated that, except for the item on dismissal, which can increase the preferential treatment bonus by one month, the other five items are absolutely rejected. Labor felt that the company's so-called seven months of preferential treatment bonus does not even include rice subsidies, and small salaries amount to only about 350 or 60 yuan. How can they survive? It is difficult to accept, and they quickly left, scheduled to make a decision again at 10 am tomorrow.

### Japanese Military Police Arrest Chinese in French Concession: Six Men and Three Women

The English-language "Great China Evening Post" reported that Japanese military police, together with police officers from the French Concession, went to No. 176 Minthiniyin Road this morning (11th) to arrest six Chinese men and three women. They were taken away in trucks. The reason is unknown. When the truck passed Weermeng Road, one of the six men, a tailor, jumped out of the truck and escaped. The Japanese military police escorting the truck immediately fired a shot, which missed. By the time the truck stopped and the car was chased, the tailor had disappeared. According to news from the Shewen News Agency, a man in the truck suddenly jumped out of the car while the car was moving slower, trying to escape. A Japanese military police officer in the car got out of the car to chase him and fired two shots. As a result, the fleeing man was still captured. It is heard that the reason for the arrest of these people is related to the assassination of a Japanese military police officer in Nanshi.

### Dr. Weidan, Medical Doctor, Residing in Cathay Hotel: New Method of Treatment Is Increasingly Remarkable

Dr. Weidan's divine skill, called "Touching the Nasal Membrane," cures difficult and complicated diseases every day. Chinese seeking medical treatment throng the roads outside the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, which shows the success of his skill.

Those suffering from asthma, after being treated by Dr. Weidan, begin to rejuvenate. Some have suffered from this terrible disease for many years. After several treatments by Dr. Weidan, their illness disappears as if lost, and all marvel at its magic.

Dr. Weidan once said to someone, "My skill is not just to temporarily stop asthma, but actually has the potential to eradicate the root cause. Most patients have no recurrence after being cured."

I have studied this disease for 15 years. Based on these many years of experience, I deeply know that after the nerve endings of the nasal mucosa are touched by my skill, all the corresponding nerves that cause asthma are stimulated by me to restore their normal state, and the disease of asthma is also cured.

"To this day, I dare to say that among 100 asthma patients seeking medical treatment, 80 will be completely cured or greatly relieved of their symptoms. As for recurring coughs and chronic bronchitis, treating them with my skill can be effective and improve the patient's health." There are also many people whose divine-related diseases have been cured by Dr. Weidan's divine healing. One patient had been unconscious for four years, and half of the right side of his body, one hand and one foot, could not move and felt tremors, and it was difficult to speak. When the patient first sought medical treatment, he needed the support of his family. After six treatments by Dr. Weidan, he could already move on his own and the tremors had been greatly reduced. Dr. Weidan said that in a few months he would be like a normal person. There was also a patient suffering from stomach pain. Because the stomach pain was too severe, he strictly restricted his diet. After the first treatment, his illness disappeared as if lost, and after a while, he was completely cured.

Dr. Weidan's treatment of nervous system diseases is also extremely rapid. The recent treatment of two epilepsy patients is particularly remarkable. Everyone knows the tragic state of this disease. Whether the patient is a child or a young person who looks healthy, they suddenly lose consciousness, fall to the ground, and tremble all over. It was previously thought to be an incurable disease, but now it can be treated with the skill of "Touching the Nasal Membrane." Dr. Weidan had cured more than 30 cases of this disease in Vietnam.

The new skill of "Touching the Nasal Membrane" also has a significant effect on the slow development of children's physical and mental development. Lazy children are actually sick children and should not be scolded indiscriminately, but should be treated as soon as possible so that their intelligence and courage can be developed.

Dr. Weidan does not need the help of medicine to diagnose and treat various diseases, only using a small metal rod to touch the nerve points of the nasal mucus membrane. The magic of his skill is even more amazing, but it is largely the same as the ancient Chinese method of acupuncture. The difference is that our method uses gold needles to pierce various parts of the whole body, while Dr. Weidan only touches the nasal membrane.

In fact, the principles of these two methods are the same. They both recognize that our health depends on the normal function of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system. Whether it is the ancient Chinese method or Dr. Weidan's new method, they all stimulate and excite the starting point of the nerves to achieve the effect of treating diseases.

It is deeply believed that future medicine will rely more on this skill, because it can directly reach the cause of various diseases.

Dr. Weidan is determined to promote his divine skill around the world and has traveled to South America, Madagascar,

Vietnam and other places, diagnosing and treating various diseases, with remarkable effects. Now, passing by Shanghai, he originally planned to stay for a short time, but because of the large number of patients seeking medical treatment, he could not refuse and tentatively plans to stay in Shanghai for several months. Those suffering from the above-mentioned diseases and wanting to open their meridians can go to Room 707 of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund from 10 am to 12 noon and 5 pm to 6 pm (except Saturday afternoons and Sundays), and there are Chinese doctors to assist, and patients can consult them on everything. Please do not hesitate and miss the opportunity.

### English Financial and Commercial Newspaper Reports: China's Progress Is Astonishing

The People Unanimously Support the Government's National Policy; Rapid Progress in Reconstruction in Resistance

According to the English "Financial and Commercial Daily" published yesterday, every week there are several new developments in western China. The news about small-scale factories or cooperative enterprises does not seem very important, but the collective strength of these enterprises is very noteworthy. The Japanese often say that General Chiang Kai-shek's army has lost its ability to resist, but the Chinese do not believe such rumors. Even if what the Japanese say is assumed to be true, the strength of the Chinese rear is being restored and will soon be quite impressive.

Overseas Compatriots Are Enthusiastically Contributing Funds

Currently, major cities in Free China are promoting savings campaigns. Although individual donations are limited, the total amount obtained by each group often reaches millions of yuan. This alone is enough to illustrate the willingness of the Chinese people to not stop resisting aggression. Moreover, people from all over China are enthusiastically donating funds, fearing to be left behind. Taking Guangxi Province as an example, the amount of public bonds actually sold in April reached more than 15 million yuan. Overseas Chinese magnates such as Hu Wenhu and Chen Jiageng are also sparing no effort to promote the sale of patriotic bonds. According to an estimate from Hong Kong by the newspaper's Hong Kong correspondent, the amount of patriotic donations made by overseas Chinese to their motherland in 1940 totaled more than 70 million yuan.

Large Amounts of Floating Capital in Shanghai Are Being Developed in the Interior

As is generally known, the amount of floating capital currently in Shanghai is about 250 million yuan. The Chongqing government certainly hopes that a portion of this floating capital can be invested in the interior. According to official and private sources, in the past few months, a lot of money has been remitted from Shanghai to Free China to be used for investment in the interior. Many of the well-to-do merchants in Shanghai are from Zhejiang Province. They are very supportive of the plan advocated by their leader, Chu Aping.

Chu Aping Plans to Create Transportation Business

It is heard that Chu's plan is to invest 200 million yuan in Free China. Chu recently traveled to various places in the southwest and northwest and had several meetings with the Chongqing authorities and General Chiang Kai-shek. It is said that his plan includes trade and transportation projects, as well as several small-scale industries, all based on private capital. It is understood that in the first four months of this year, the amount of floating capital remitted from Hong Kong to Free China totaled 150 million yuan. During the same period, the amount of floating capital remitted from Shanghai to Free China totaled 500 million yuan.

Various New Factories Have Been Established One After Another

Currently, the new industries run by the Free China government include cotton yarn factories and match factories. The cotton yarn factory has a capital of 300,000 yuan and will be opened this month. All necessary machines have been purchased. The match factories have a capital of 1 million yuan and produce 80 million boxes of matches per year. There will be 30,000 workers in the factories. The Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Agriculture established a factory at the beginning of this month to manufacture soybean powder. The local industrial cooperative will cooperate with this factory and is expected to produce 700 dan of fertilizer per month. The fertilizer will be manufactured using animal bones.

Tea and Tung Oil for Soviet Military Equipment

It is generally expected that the Chongqing government will soon establish a Ministry of Trade to specialize in China's export trade. At the same time, the Fuxing and Fuhua Trading Companies have merged to centralize the export trade of Free China under one organization. The chairman of the new company after the merger is Kong Xiangxi, and the vice chairman is Chen Guangfu. After the Soviet Union and Japan concluded the so-called "Neutrality Pact," negotiations on the old agreement on barter trade between the Soviet Union and China have also begun. It is generally expected that these negotiations will be successful in the next few days. Under the new agreement, Chinese tea and tung oil will be exchanged for Soviet raw materials, including large quantities of aviation gasoline.

### Chongqing-Hong Kong-Rangoon Planes: Revised Flight Schedule

The China National Aviation Corporation has revised its schedule for flights between Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Rangoon. Subsequently, there will be three flights per week between Hong Kong and Chongqing, flying from Chongqing to Hong Kong on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and from Hong Kong to Chongqing on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. There will be one flight per week between Chongqing and Rangoon, flying from Chongqing to Ledo on Saturdays and Sundays, and then flying to Rangoon the next day. On Mondays, it will return from Rangoon to Chongqing via Ledo. After the revision of this flight schedule, the airmail time between Shanghai, Chongqing, Kunming, and Rangoon will also change accordingly. However, the airmail sent from Shanghai to various places in the southwest must depend on the dispatch time of the Shanghai Post Office, which will be transported by ship to Hong Kong to connect with China National Aviation Corporation's flights. Also, airmail sent to Rangoon, Malaya, the South Seas, Australia, and Sydney, if transported via China National Aviation Corporation's airmail flights from Chongqing to Rangoon, will be very fast. Since British Overseas Airways Corporation has now changed its departure point to Singapore, and the ships are transported later, according to news from the post office, if transported jointly by China National Aviation Corporation and British Overseas Airways Corporation, in addition to paying international airmail fees, China National Aviation Corporation's airmail fee will be only 25 cents per five grams. It only takes seven days to send from Shanghai to Rangoon.

### Yesterday Morning Seven Japanese Men Suddenly Went to the First Special Court

They Were Stopped by the Merchant Corps Before Reaching the Courtroom, and Later Japanese Police Arrived to Persuade Them to Leave

Yesterday (the 11th) at about 9 a.m., seven Japanese men suddenly went to the First Special Court on North Zhejiang Road, intending to enter the courtroom, but were stopped, causing the atmosphere to become tense. Later, Japanese police from the Public Concession investigated and dispersed them, and the situation calmed down. The seven Japanese men were all dressed in plain clothes and arrived in two cars (license plate numbers not disclosed) at the entrance of the First Special Court at 9:45 a.m. They were first stopped by the gatekeeper because private cars were not allowed to enter the courtyard. The Japanese men then got out of the cars and walked into the courtyard, without incident. However, when they reached the courtroom, they were stopped by members of the International Merchant Corps stationed there, and a dispute arose. Shortly after, several Japanese police officers arrived and persuaded the Japanese men to leave the courtyard.

### American President Lines Rushing to Build Three Giant Ships

To Arrive in the Far East on Schedule Within This Year, to Make Up for the Shortage of Four Requisitioned Ships

According to information obtained by American President Lines from the American and German Company, to maintain navigation of the ships of the American President Lines operating on the America-Asia-Europe routes, which are being requisitioned by the U.S. Maritime Commission, the sister ships President Burke and two other ships are being completed ahead of schedule, so that the schedules can be maintained and navigation is not interrupted.

Three New Ships Completed Ahead of Schedule

It is reported that the three President liners that the company is completing ahead of schedule are part of this year's planned program. The ones that have already been completed and have sailed to the Far East include the President Jackson, President Monroe, President Hayes, and President Garfield. The ones that will be completed ahead of schedule include the President Adams, President Polk, and President Van Buren. These ships will arrive in various parts of the Far East on schedule. The new President Jackson is another of the above six ships and is the first ship completed by the company to replace the old President Jackson.

Equipped with Novel Features, Sailing to Shanghai on Schedule

The President Adams, President Burke, and President Van Buren each have a deadweight of 16,900 tons and a net weight of 5,400 tons, and are equipped with 60,000 cubic feet of electric refrigerators. The interior design is exceptionally novel, and the fuel engines have great power, each engine having 850 horsepower. The sleeping quarters are equipped with private toilets and bathrooms, which are improvements over the original mail ships, surpassing the comfort of ships like the Tatsuta Maru and Hikawa Maru. The sailing speed allows for a circumnavigation of the world in 84 days, shortening the old ship's voyage by 14 days. However, future voyages will avoid the Mediterranean and will instead go around South Africa, via the Cape of Good Hope, back to the United States, following the established schedule.

### Japanese Trade with China Declining in Dumping Power

In the first year after the war, Japan's trade with China saw a massive influx of Japanese goods through Shanghai and Tianjin, which were then dumped into the occupied areas. At the same time, China's resources, such as cotton, hemp, and ores, were forcibly acquired from the occupied areas, and the shipping industry along the Chinese coast and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was monopolized. However, since this year, Japan's war expenditures have been too great, resulting in a sharp reduction in the production of Japanese goods and a sharp decline in Japanese exports to China. Furthermore, due to the successful adjustment of Sino-American trade, Japan's trade with China has gradually declined. Imports have fallen from first place to second, and exports have fallen from second to fourth place. Although efforts have been made to salvage this trade, they have ultimately failed.

### French Ambassador Cosme Calls on Subordinates

Inquires About Shanghai's Situation in Detail, Will Stay Here for Several Days

French Ambassador to China Cosme, after arriving in Shanghai by plane the afternoon before yesterday, summoned the French Consul General in Shanghai Magelri, the Commissioner of the French Police Bureau Lieutenant Colonel Furbot, the Commander of the French Forces in China Colonel Ysault, the Justice of the French Court in China Sidetga, and Major Kaufman, and inquired in detail about the recent situation in Shanghai. Starting yesterday, Ambassador Cosme went to the French Consulate at 1 Gongguan Road in the French Concession to work. After staying in Shanghai for a few days, he will go elsewhere. As for the previous order from the French government to replace the Ambassador, it is rumored that it has been cancelled. The original appointee, Mr. Robien, is 53 years old and served as the Director of the American Bureau of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1933. From 1933 to 1934, he served as the Head of the Personnel Department of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in 1940 he served as the Ambassador to Argentina. Mr. Robien is known as an expert on the United States, but he is not as familiar with the situation in China as Mr. Cosme.

### Equipment of Children's Hospital Also Being Moved

Currently There Are Forty Sick Children

The Shanghai Children's Hospital at 51 Molier Road in the French Concession, which is run by a certain Chinese gentleman and was opened after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, benefiting Chinese children. The afternoon before yesterday, some people suddenly went to the hospital and began to take away beds and desks. As of yesterday, they were still busy moving medical equipment and supplies, loading them into vehicles and driving away. It is reported that there are currently forty sick children in the hospital. The hospital building was previously owned by Song Ziwen. The person in charge of the removal said that they have the right to take over the hospital's assets.

Shanghai Hospitals Gradually Returning to Normal

The equipment that the Shanghai Hospital at 172 Qiqi Road borrowed from the International Red Cross was seized at the end of last week. The situation in the hospital at that time was inevitably chaotic. Fortunately, various parties provided assistance and donated beds and other items, and it gradually returned to normal. The American director of the hospital, Ms. Haige, said that the work in the hospital is expected to return to normal in a few days.

### Individual Parcels to North China Not Subject to Special Restrictions

The Shanghai Office of the Directorate General of Posts has ordered that commodity parcels sent to various parts of North China should be submitted with a permit at the time of posting before they can be accepted. As for genuine individual parcels, it is not necessary to submit a permit, but the sender should bear the responsibility. If commodity parcels are mixed with individual parcels for posting, once discovered, the post office will not be responsible for any punishment.

### Chen Yifei Confesses to Extortion and Fraud Without Denying

Xu Linshan, the manager of Rongyang Sock Factory at 81 Binlang Road, lives at 1033 Binlang Road. On the 5th, 30th of last month and the 4th of this month, he received two threatening letters delivered by bandits, demanding that Xu pay 40,000 yuan in national currency, otherwise his life would be in danger. However, when the three letters were delivered, Xu happened to be away from Shanghai, so no action was taken. Recently, when Xu came to Shanghai, he discovered the letters, but since the agreed time had passed, he did not make contact. Recently, Xu suddenly received a phone call from the bandits, instructing Xu to send the money to the intersection of Baker Road and North Henan Road between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on the 10th, with the person holding a pack of Old Knife brand cigarettes as a sign. Xu reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, and detectives Yu Changyuan, Bu Zongting, Zhao Yongji, Bai Wenqi, and others disguised themselves and waited. As a result, they arrested a Ningbo man, Chen Jifei (29 years old), and brought him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Jiang Baolian, requested permission for a postponement, as it was still necessary to investigate the accomplices. Chen Jifei was questioned and confessed to writing the threatening letters and defrauding the plaintiff of money without denying it. After Zhong Qingshi verified the confession, he ordered him to be detained pending a further hearing.

### Lin Daohua and Lin Daoxin Detained for Embezzling Clock Materials

Yi Xin Clock Material Store at 7, Lane 10, Shanxi Road, was established by Ningbo native Lin Daoxue and jointly run by his brothers Lin Daohua and Lin Daoxin. Lin Daoxue left without saying goodbye on the 15th of last month and his whereabouts are unknown. The store was then temporarily managed by his wife, Ms. Chen. However, the day before yesterday, when she went out on business and returned to the store, all the business assets, worth more than 10,000 yuan, had disappeared. She reported it to the Central Police Station. After investigation by detective Peng Bingsheng and detective Wang Qi, it was determined that it must have been done by He Daohua and Daoxin. Lin Daohua, Daoxin, and shop assistant Lin Zhicai were arrested at 77 An Shen Li, Kang Ti Road. They confessed that all the items were hidden in room 135 of the Lakeside Building on North Suzhou Road, and they were also recovered. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. The police station lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested a postponement, and Judge Feng ordered them to be detained pending a further hearing.

### Deadline for Loan Applications for Unemployed Employees of Two Railways

More Than 4,000 People Applied

The Shanghai-East China and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Workers' Union previously requested the authorities to allocate funds for relief because the employees of the two railways who were dismissed have been unemployed and are experiencing difficult living conditions. Approval was granted to allocate 50,000 yuan, which was distributed by the workers' union. The union originally set a deadline of one month, but because employees from remote areas had difficulty traveling to the union to apply, the deadline was extended by one day to allow more people to apply for loans. As of the day before yesterday (the 10th), the deadline has passed. The number of people who applied for loans totaled more than 4,100.

### Guoyi Pingmin Hospital in Urgent Need of Funds for Summer

Guoyi Pingmin Hospital at 88 Robert Road in Shanghai has been operating for more than a year since it opened in July of last year. It has 200 to 300 outpatients and more than 100 inpatients every day, and the beds are always full. As summer approaches, the number of patients is even greater. At this time, when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, and Chinese medicine is extremely expensive, the cost of medicine, food, and rice for each inpatient is estimated to be 2.56 yuan per day. According to statistics, the monthly expenses are at least 8,000 yuan, which rely on enthusiastic donations from all sectors of society and major philanthropists for maintenance. Now that the hot summer is approaching, the number of patients is increasing and the expenses are huge, and we feel deeply exhausted. We hope that all sectors of society, all industries, and all major philanthropists will have compassion for the suffering of the poor and sick, generously donate funds, and provide continuous assistance for the long-term survival of the hospital. This is truly immeasurable merit. The hospital's office and donation collection point are located in the Renji Shantang on Yunnan Road.

### Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Broadcasts to Raise Funds

Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at 95 Yuqiaqing Road has been operating for 23 years. Every summer, it specializes in treating epidemic diseases and providing free medical treatment and medicine to the poor. Recently, due to the crowded population in the concessions, the summer has already arrived. This year, the weather is abnormal and the epidemic is bound to be rampant, and the number of people seeking treatment will inevitably increase. Last year, the number of people treated reached 104,000, so the original site is insufficient. Now, a three-story ward has been newly built to expand the capacity. Moreover, due to the soaring prices of medicines, the expenses are huge. Mr. Huang Jinrong, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Wu Limen, and others, prominent figures in Shanghai, in view of this, have launched an invitation to famous opera singers and performers to perform special Peking opera programs at the Guohua Radio Station (frequency 1200) (phone 982309823) from 2:00 p.m. on June 16th and 17th (Monday and Tuesday) to raise funds from all sectors of society. All famous Shanghai artists will participate, and the programs will be extremely exciting. We deeply hope that all sectors will enthusiastically request songs and generously donate to help the vulnerable and relieve poverty, which is truly the highest merit.

### No Reduction in the Weight of Hong Kong Rice, Tribute Rice to Arrive Next Week

According to news from the Police Department of the Public Concession, the Public Works Department issued a notice yesterday stating, "For the matter of a notice, it is hereby announced that the net weight of each picul of the Public Works Department's foreign rice is 160 catties, excluding the sack. Rice merchants must not reduce any quantity as commission or for other purposes. Furthermore, the price of the Public Works Department's foreign rice is 110 yuan in national currency per picul of 160 catties net weight, and this prescribed limit must not be exceeded. Let it be known to all, and obey. This special notice is hereby issued."

Continuing to Order Hong Kong Rice: This reporter learned from relevant parties that the total amount of foreign rice transported to Shanghai by the Public Works Department, in addition to the 165,000 bags already delivered in the first phase, is increased by another 80,000 bags ordered from the Hong Kong government to meet demand, as local grain stores have placed many orders and rice dealers have requested further allocation. It is reported that it has been loaded onto ships of the Jardine Matheson and Taikoo shipping companies in batches and will arrive in Shanghai around the 15th of this month.

Group Orders: Since the authorities announced the method for group rice purchases last week, many groups have filled out applications, requesting to place orders. This reporter learned from the Likki Bank yesterday that the Yangshupu Shanghai Electric Power Company has obtained approval from the authorities to purchase 1,100 bags of foreign rice from the Public Works Department at the Wufu Rice Store on Robert Road, with the price remaining at 110 yuan per picul.

A reporter from the Pingming News Agency learned from reliable sources yesterday that the Public Works Department, in order to further lower rice prices and thoroughly relieve the people's food problems, will handle other foreign rice in addition to Xiaojiao rice, which will also be sold at low prices, so that rice prices in this city cannot rise again.

### The Ultimate Principle of All Religions Is "Middle Way"

At the 17th lecture of the Rongwu Scripture Study Society, Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke on "The Middle Way Is the Ultimate Principle of All Religions," saying: The Book of Documents has fifty-five chapters. My predecessor, Wen Jinggong, said, "In a word, it can be summed up as the Middle Way." Since Heaven bestowed the expression of the Middle Way upon the people, the people received the Middle Way of Heaven and Earth to be born. Duke Kang of Liu believed it was "fate," and Cheng Bozi believed it was "the nature of Heaven's mandate." Heaven mandates and people receive, only this one Middle Way exists. Outside of this Middle Way, there is no Heaven's mandate or human nature. Zisi said, "The great root of the world," Cheng said, "The correct path of the world," Zhu Xi said, "Reach the extreme of the Middle Way and Heaven and Earth will be in their positions," meaning that the Middle Way is how humans establish their beginning and end, their ultimate point, and participate with Heaven and Earth. Therefore, it is the ultimate principle of all religions. Let us try to illustrate it.

Confucianism: The meaning of the Middle Way does not go beyond two paths: not leaning to one side, standing without being near the four sides, the nature of one's constitution, being in the Middle Way. Without excess or deficiency, acting without being ahead or behind, the correctness of reason, the Middle Way of affairs. To speak of the body of the Middle Way, there is nothing more refined than the Doctrine of the Mean, and nothing more complete than the Commentary on the Book of Changes. The Image Commentary says "Correct and Middle," Lianxi's Supreme Polarity Diagram and Zhengmeng both speak of "Middle Correctness," the Appended Commentary says "Stand in the Middle Way," the Doctrine of the Mean says "Middle Way without leaning," which is what the Cheng brothers mean by "not leaning." Again, acting in the Middle Way, the Benefit Hexagram and Mencius both speak of "Middle Way conduct." "Establishing one's position in the Middle Way," the Doctrine of the Mean says "Achieve harmony through the Middle Way, Heaven and Earth will be in their positions," Shao Yong's Observation of Things says "The origin of Heaven and Earth begins in the Middle Way," "All methods of the heart arise from the Middle Way." Shun "Uses the Middle Way for the people," Zhong Hui "Establishes the Middle Way for the people," Xun Shuang "The sage establishes the Middle Way of Heaven and Earth and creates rites," which is what the Great Plan says "Establish and use the Grand Ultimate," Kong Shu's commentary says "The great self establishes its Middle Way." Therefore, the Analects narrates Yao's abdication to Shun, Shun ordered Wan, and all the sages transmitted the methods of the heart, saying "Sincerely hold to the Middle Way," Mencius says "Tang held to the Middle Way," and criticized "Zi Ge held to the Middle Way without power," not knowing that sincerely holding to the Middle Way requires adapting to the situation at all times. Otherwise, one will inevitably be rigid and inflexible. Therefore, "The Middle Way of the Superior Person" is "The Superior Person and the Middle Way in Time," which is why Confucius is "the Most Sage."

Taoism: The Book of Changes's Weft, Qian Jian says "The beginning of the West is all governed by the Center," Xunzi's Outline says "To be near the four sides, there is nothing like the Center," Han Fei's Power of Authority says "Affairs are in the four directions, but the key is in the Center," Huainanzi's Original Tao says "Grasping the handle of the Tao, establish it in the Center," which is what Zhuangzi means by "Stand in the Center," and Laozi means by "It is better to guard the Center." Mingdao says "Good and evil are in the body, excess and deficiency are called evil, take the good in the middle of the excess and deficiency." Stopping the Meng gains qi, leading to the good in the Middle Way." Zhen Xishan says "Measure with the principles of what should be, and actions will be appropriate, and there will not be a single matter that is not in the Middle Way." In short, "Just right."

Buddhism: Nagarjuna created the Treatise on the Middle Way, breaking emptiness and breaking falsehood, and also breaking the view of clinging to the Middle Way, taking non-attainment as Prajna, the most thorough is Prajna. Chapter on the Four Noble Truths "Phenomena arising from conditions, are also empty, also false, also the Middle Way." Tiantai School "Views two thousand phenomena, each of which is independent," "There is no exchange of emptiness and falsehood." This "Independent Middle Way," also speaks of "Middle Way against bias," "Exhaustive Middle Way," the Three Treatises' Profound Meaning "Neither existence nor non-existence, therefore speak of the existence of existence and non-existence" the "Forming the False Middle Way," Separate Teaching "Waits for the condition of ignorance to give rise to false phenomena," "Returning to Suchness is emptiness." Perfect Teaching "Originally possesses Suchness's harmonious falsehood purity, the mutual blending of all phenomena without difference harmonious emptiness purity." Nature School "Views the eight negations of all phenomena," Appearance School "Views the existence of biased attachment, and the non-emptiness of reliant perfection as the Middle View." Vasubandhu created the Treatise on Distinguishing the Middle and Extremes to explain Maitreya's Ode to the Treatise on Distinguishing the Middle and Extremes, the Essentials of Consciousness state "Middle Way School," Appearance School "The Middle Way teaches that things exist but are not non-existent," the Flower Garland School takes the Dharma Realm as the Middle Way, and the Lotus School takes reality as the Middle Way. The Four Teachings' Ceremony "Uses the Middle Way view to break a fraction of ignorance, revealing a fraction of the Three Virtues." Beginning and End Essential Principles "The Middle Truth governs all phenomena," Zhi Guan Fu Xing "One color" incense is the unconditioned Middle Way, which is the Dharma Realm, which is the Zhi Guan." Possesses emptiness, falsehood, and talks about the Middle Truth, both negation and illumination, departing from the borders of existence and non-existence, all phenomena are perfect without excess, is the Middle Way's First Meaning View.

Christianity: The Old Testament Psalms 119 repeatedly "hates the false path," in contrast to Jesus's saying "True Path." Proverbs chapter 4 ends "Look straight ahead, look straight ahead, make your path smooth, make your way steady, do not turn to the left or right," secretly conforming to the principle of "Middle Straightness" and "Middle Correctness" in the Book of Changes. The Book of Ecclesiastes's first two verses "Life is nothing but emptiness and烦恼," "The wise and the foolish all return to one death," chapter three "Birth and death, sorrow and joy, success and destruction, each has its appointed time," chapter seven, verse 16, warns against excessive righteousness, the whole chapter resembles the sayings of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. The New Testament Timothy, "The only mediator," Hebrews "The one who pleases the Lord," outside of the doctrine of the Trinity "God knows in the Middle Way," Paul's Letter to the Romans chapter 12 verse 3 "According to the Middle Way," this one sentence is shared by the world's ten great religions.

Islam: The Meaning of the Five Pillars of the Book of Rites, the nature of the heart "The virtue of three parts, must be appropriate in the middle, if there is a bias, its path will be lost. The five pillars are to save its bias and return to the middle." Correct changes "It must be that the qi is well-obtained, and each uses its middle correctness. If the nourishment is lost, then the middle turns into reliance, and the correct turns into bias. Once the five natures change, the private desires will be born, and all evils will follow. All of this is due to the loss of nourishment of the qi, and each turns against its middle." The five pillars are the method of nourishing the qi, and fixing the five natures in the most middle." That is, the meaning of the Quran's "Supreme Way is the Middle Way." The Five Limitations quote "The scripture says, when your people worship, they must guard their middle." That is the principle of Laozi's "Guarding the Middle," the Original Teaching of Heavenly Square Ceremony "The Way of the Sage, connects to the Infinite. The teaching of the Perfect Man, is correct, great, and supremely middle." This is what the Prophet Muhammad said "I transform people with the Middle Way." This "Middle Way" is the ultimate principle of all religions.

### Grain Market Trends: Rice Market Weakens

Imported rice prices fell yesterday as supply continued to arrive in abundance. Recent arrivals totaled no less than 70,000 to 80,000 bags, with more shipments still on the way. Cheap Saigon rice could be sold publicly again, and low production costs and continuous new deals added to the pressure. As a result, market sentiment immediately turned negative. In the morning, merchants from inland China and Shantou bought 4,000 to 5,000 bags of broken and small-grain rice, but the Ningbo merchants had not yet shipped their orders. Sales within the city were also slow, and many retailers took the opportunity to sell at high prices. Consequently, imported rice prices immediately began to decline. Only broken rice saw some actual sales and remained stable. However, with aggressive sales by foreign merchants, prices eventually dropped by one to two yuan. Saigon No. 1 fell from 119 yuan to 118 yuan, while lower-quality goods were only selling for 117 yuan or 116.5 yuan. No. 2 dropped from 113.5 yuan to 112 yuan. Siam No. 1 was at 115 yuan, high-quality No. 2 was at 111 yuan or 110 yuan, and lower-quality No. 2 was at 108 yuan. Small-grain rice from the Pudong warehouse initially sold for 114.5 yuan, but later only fetched 113.5 yuan. Rice from the Western warehouse dropped from 113.5 yuan to 111.5 yuan. Fire-grain rice was at 115 yuan, Qiaofo rice was at 117.3 yuan, and Tokyo top-grade broken rice was at 105-106 yuan, while ordinary broken rice was at 91-90 yuan, a drop of more than two yuan. Only Min Dang rice remained popular due to its appeal in rural areas, and the limited supply kept prices firm. Special-grade rice continued to open at 122-123 yuan, high-quality rice at 120 yuan, and lower-quality rice at 118 yuan. In the afternoon, new deals for imported rice further weakened the market. Saigon No. 1 spot prices were quoted as low as 116 yuan. New deals included 3,000 tons of small-grain rice for June from firms such as Dafu and Xinchangsheng, priced at 135 yuan. Some said the actual transaction was for 2,500 tons at only 134.5 yuan. There was a return shipment of 1,000 tons of Siam No. 1 at 130 yuan, reportedly a price inquiry by telegram. Spot resales on the market by firms like Yanghua totaled over 700 tons: Saigon No. 1 at 139 yuan, small-grain rice at 138 yuan, broken rice at 109 yuan, 107-108 yuan, and lower-quality broken rice at 105 yuan. In the afternoon, market sentiment was weak, and resale prices were quoted one to two yuan lower, but there were few buyers.

The sale of thick and thin japonica rice from mainland China seemed to be coming to an end, with both arrivals and sales slow. Only a few scattered transactions occurred across the city, and the market was uneventful. Special-grade early and late rice from southern ports continued to open at 136-137 yuan, ordinary rice at 134-135 yuan, and lower-quality rice at 132-130 yuan. Wuxi overnight japonica rice was at 121-122 yuan.

The glutinous rice market remained sparse, with only small demand from food vendors and pastry shops, which was also slightly weaker. As a result, the market was stable yesterday, with no significant changes. Special-grade Hong Kong round-grain rice remained at 116-117 yuan, while high-quality round-grain rice ranged from 115 yuan to 113 yuan. Lower-quality Guannuo green glutinous rice was at 102-103 yuan, and high-quality white glutinous rice was at 105-106 yuan. Mainland glutinous rice also saw little change, remaining at 121-122 yuan.

### Flour Market: A Surge Followed by Stability

Imported flour prices softened again, with weaker demand. The rice market decline also dampened sentiment, and various off-brand flours flooded the market, causing prices to suffer. Golden Dragon flour initially opened at 29 yuan, and Pudong warehouse flour at 28.6 yuan, but the market later only saw 28.4 yuan. However, Australian flour remained stable due to limited inventory and arrivals. Flower, Bird, Clock Tower, and Bank warehouse flour still fetched 30.04-30.05 yuan. Red Sun flour was newly opened at 100 bags, priced at only 29.7 yuan. It was rumored that this flour was water-damaged, hence the low price, which indirectly pulled down other brands. Today, 600 bags of flour were shipped to Xiamen on the Taikoo Hanyang ship.

Wheat trading remained quiet. Arrivals of old wheat have been scarce for a long time and are no longer in demand. It was rumored that 300 bags of new wheat from nearby Kunshan and Taicang had arrived, but no samples were seen on the market. It was said that the goods were being negotiated with Japanese factories at a price of 38 yuan, but this could not be confirmed. According to industry insiders, the current production cost of new wheat is around 36 yuan, and adding various fees and transportation makes it unprofitable. Moreover, transportation permits have not yet been issued, so its official market entry is still pending.

### Financial Markets: Stable Foreign Exchange, Reduced Trading

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC post stable rates across all currencies. However, small banks lengthened the import USD rate by 0.0625 to 5.375 yuan. The unofficial GBP/USD rate was quite stable, and trading volume was significantly reduced. Chinese speculators were less active, as the Bank of Japan (Mitsui) tightened supply, causing July USD at 5.40625 yuan to briefly become difficult to sell, but forward settlements remained at 5.375 yuan. GBP at 3 shillings 3.125 pence remained unchanged from the previous day's closing price. There was no market in the afternoon due to it being Wednesday.

By noon, the closing price for both spot and July-term GBP was 3 shillings 3.125 pence, and USD was 5.375 yuan, the same as the previous day's closing price.

### Swap Approaching: Gold Market Fluctuates

Yesterday's gold market saw narrow fluctuations in the unofficial price, with prices hovering around 6,470 yuan. Midway, the HSBC small banks lengthened the USD rate, and a certain Japanese bank tightened its supply of USD at 5.40625 yuan. Exchange houses stopped buying and competed to sell, causing the price to drop from 6,477 yuan to 6,453 yuan. It was soon absorbed and pulled up by securities firms, eventually only falling by a small two yuan. After closing, it rose back to 6,476 yuan, a rise of two yuan. The total trading volume for half a day was nearly 10,000 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon due to it being Wednesday. The spot price saw a slight rise.

Futures See No Significant Rise or Fall

The opening price this morning for each bar (10 taels) at 9:15 a.m. was 6,465 yuan, 9 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. Dafeng and retail investors bought in at the low price, pushing it back up to 6,477 yuan. Soon after, exchange houses Shun Yuan and Decheng sold, Yida competed to sell, and hearing that the central gold price had tightened slightly, Dafeng also began to sell again, followed by retail investors, causing the price to gradually fall by 24 yuan. At around 10 a.m., it fell to 6,453 yuan. Chengji Gold Shop bought in, and Yida, Chida, and Xinfengyong absorbed the supply, so the price gradually stabilized around 6,465 yuan. The noon closing price rose to 6,472 yuan, 2 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. Based on the settlement price of June USD at 5.375 yuan, it was 6,479 yuan, only 7 yuan lower. After closing, Yuxing and Yongli bought 600-700 taels, pushing the price up to 6,476 yuan. There was a range of 24 yuan in the first half of the day. There was no market in the afternoon.

### Bank Drafts: Premium Unchanged

Yesterday's bank draft discount rate was still one yuan per ten yuan paid by those swapping for cash, the same as the previous day. The interest rate for interbank lending posted by the Money Trade Association remained at three cents in both the morning and afternoon markets, unchanged.

Hong Kong bills were in balance between supply and demand, and the price remained stable. Japanese gold bills trended slightly firmer, rising to 1.925 yuan in the evening market. Korean bills trended stable, and the price remained unchanged at 1.63 yuan in the evening market.

### Securities: Government Bonds Surge Again

The unofficial government bond market turned positive again yesterday. After a brief correction, prices fell by about one yuan, but that has passed. Yesterday, interbank lending was only at three cents, and the money supply was extremely loose. The bank draft premium disappeared and even saw a discount, a strong indication of abundant liquidity. Therefore, the financial community was quite active, and sentiment has shifted upward. The increase in short positions on the trading floor and the stability of long positions suggest a positive outlook. Yesterday morning, Hongda continued to buy, Xie Kang and Qian Yi switched from short to long positions, and Zhongyi also bought. Lianyi and Yitai sold. Xinhua sold Class C and B bonds and bought Class E bonds. The noon closing price improved by three to four jiao. In the afternoon, a certain bank bought a large amount of Class A bonds, brokered by Yitai, Xieda, and Jiufeng. Lianyi switched to buying. Huachang, Xinchang, Hengfu, and Runde all bought. Although Yitai supplied Class C bonds, and Tongkang sold a small amount, and Fuhe, Lianhe, and Runli cut their long positions, Class C bonds still broke through the nine-yuan mark. Class A bonds, which had been inactive for a long time, were now attracting attention, surging by over one yuan. Class B bonds also broke out by one yuan, and Class D bonds also reached seven yuan, showing a very good trend with the possibility of further gains. The market eventually rebounded by four jiao to 1.5 yuan, with a total trading volume of 3.2 to 3.3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.

Stock Trading: Four Clear Transactions. 30 shares of bank stocks were traded at a price of 57 yuan.

The stock market was exceptionally firm and active, with good sentiment. The prices of various stocks continued to rise. International stocks reached a high of 25.25 yuan, Wheelock Marden was at 98 yuan, Xiangtai Timber was at 50 yuan, Steel was at 30 yuan, and Ken Zhi was at 24.75 yuan. Rubber stocks also showed improvement, and prices were generally firm.

London, 10th (Tuesday) telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained stagnant. Only bank stocks saw minor fluctuations. Mercantile Bank shares rose by 2 shillings 6 pence to £8 17s 6d. HSBC London-registered shares rose by half a pound to £75.5. Hong Kong-registered shares fell by one pound to £78, with transactions but no market. There were no other changes.

### Yarn and Cotton: Double Horse Shipments Continue Uninterrupted; Futures and Spot Prices Slowly Rise

The yarn market continued to rise after a period of consolidation, and the bullish sentiment intensified slightly. This was due to the uninterrupted shipments of Double Horse yarn overseas, which gradually tightened the supply. As a result, although short sellers exerted pressure, they were aware of the unfavorable environment and made some covering purchases. At the same time, Hong Kong merchants bought 1,100 bales of various yarns, of which Double Horse accounted for 600 bales. Given this situation, the market's foundation should be solid. However, most small companies had a large number of short positions. If they were to actually cover their positions, the market price could potentially reach 1,500 yuan. The current situation is still one of consolidation. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,457 yuan, and the low price was 1,438 yuan. The afternoon market was more tense than the morning, as large buyers entered the market. The initial price was 1,461 yuan, which rose directly to 1,468 yuan. Those who profited in the middle sold, pulling the price back to 1,457 yuan. The final price was 1,461-1,462 yuan. Today, 270 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

The morning opening of Double Horse was promising, but buyers on the trading floor still feigned ignorance. The opening price was 1,445 yuan. With more sellers than buyers at this price, it soon fell to 1,438 yuan. Then, news that margin gold was firm and that Guangdong merchants had a strong appetite for Double Horse boosted the market back to 1,446-1,447 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 12 o'clock, the market suddenly tightened, rising to 1,457 yuan at the closing. It was found that the total transaction volume for half a day was 8,100 bales, with Hong Kong merchants buying 1,100 bales and local merchants buying 7,000 bales.

The price of standard futures yarn for the Golden Double Horse brand slowly rose. This was because good spot sales stimulated buying activity and boosted the market. The July contract rose by 13 yuan, and the August contract rose by 12 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was approximately 5,000 bales. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left.

Morning Market   Afternoon Market

July     Open  1389  1397

Close  1387.5    1397

Daily High    1407    Low 1382

August   Open  1395  1408

Close  1398  1405.5

Daily High    1408  Low 1390

### US and Indian Cotton Prices Rise Frequently; Cotton Market Remains Firm

The spot cotton situation remains firm as usual. With margin gold and yarn markets repeatedly rising, and the good news of rising prices for U.S. and Indian cotton frequently coming, the morale is especially high. At the same time, demand from all sides is also improving, so recent transactions have been more active. Yesterday, a total of 741 pieces and 180 bales were traded, with prices rising by one to two yuan.

Also, foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai were very good. Due to repeated increases in US and Indian cotton prices, and the yarn market situation being good, buying intentions were fervent. Foreign merchants and yarn factories have been constantly replenishing their Brazilian cotton. Yesterday, the lowest selling price of Brazilian cotton exceeded 420 yuan.

The New York cotton market was lively and firm due to an unfavorable weather report for the long positions, and good cotton fabric trade conditions. Yesterday's closing prices rose again by 13-14 points.

The Indian cotton market first fell due to speculators selling and long positions being closed, but subsequently rebounded due to short covering. As a result, the closing prices, except for White Roth for July-August, fell by 2.5 rupees, all other varieties rose by about 3-4 rupees.

The forecast for today's opening market is to see a 1.5 rupee increase.

### Sugar Market: Few Transactions in Imported Sugar

Yesterday the sugar market trend was flat with few transactions. The association's trading prices were: spot 24 Crude, 本棧 (this warehouse) January 22nd arrival at 87.5 yuan; 外棧 (other warehouse) April arrival at 89 yuan, May arrival at 91 yuan to 90.5 yuan, 89.5 yuan. Jardine Matheson's Snow White B mark (西棧) west warehouse, January arrived at old price 108 yuan, DY mark east warehouse at 95 yuan, Dutch 赤讨价 (red negotiating price) 70 yuan, with no one inquiring. The rest had no market.

### Piece Goods: Narrow Outlet for Cotton Cloth, Unable to Rise

Yesterday's factory cloth market was firm with very minimal fluctuations. The factory side gradually tightened due to the rising of raw yarn, and the outlet for cotton cloth was too narrow, most dye factories were closed, the promotion of existing cloth was difficult, and囤戶 (hoarders) had enough, so the cloth market presented a staggered situation. 白货 (white goods) Yihe and other factories' coarse cloth continued to rise by 1.5 jiao to 5 jiao, and the rise and fall of fine cloth, twill, and bleached cloth were only around 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. This market still needs the seasonal fine yarn goods, khaki, rubberized cloth, and poplin, and around 200+ pieces were achieved. Guangdong, Hong Kong and Nanyang merchants handled 400+ pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, twill colored cloth, and bleached cloth. Today, 460 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Dongbu: Actual sales remain stagnant and immobile. It is unable to rise. Fine cloth is considered acceptable. The single bill closing price of the leading factory 本棧 (this warehouse) was 44.75 yuan, a rise of 5 fen compared to that. Lower tier brands continued to soften by 1-2 jiao. Fine twill has been lifted by 2.5 jiao because this market is slightly in need of it. The 四君子哔叽 (Four Gentlemen Serge) single bills 本棧 (this warehouse) do not have many chips, and they still sell for 1.4475 yuan.

### Vienna Has Vanishing Signs

Vienna绒 (Vienna velvet), in the past, occupied an important position in the呢绒 (wool) market. The colors ranged from black grey, medium grey, white grey, pure white and beige. The body of the velvet ranged from 混天 (mixed sky), 土大 (earth big) and 三天 (three days). 三天 (three days) was thicker. Both the Chinese and western clothes markets were flourishing and selling it well. The selling price was more noble than 法兰绒 (flannel). Since the previous few years, sales have been gradually declining because they were running out of delivery and sales prices soared. The buyers' demands continued to be sparse, so few people of the same trade sell it. There are even occasional inquiries asking to buy it, so each firm claims that they are out of stock. Now the Vienna绒 (Vienna velvet) can be described as quiet on delivery and sales. It is in a cut off, vanishing state on the market. As for the selling price, it can be calculated with 法兰绒 (flannel). Each single width of fabric of 20 yuan per code must be gu (sell). 8+ yuan must be sold per individual piece.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Futures Cake Sellers Are Powerful

Yesterday's bean cake market showed interesting nuances. The physical sales of physical cake were dragged into by the inland帮 (gang), so it rose slightly. Since the futures cake sellers were powerful, the overall picture was still tired, and the declining trend was difficult to fix. The remote date cake for June's next trade (June 栈单 (warehouse bill)) has fallen nearly close to the 19 yuan range. Though now, many people believe that breaking the 19 yuan range is a good opportunity to go long, so the future potential can have 1,000 types of changes. There were 7-8,000 physical cake sales in total. The price for计发字饼 (Jifa Character Cake) (March's bill) was 16.5 yuan, and the price for 肥市饼 (Feishi Cake) was 17.3 yuan to 17.1 yuan. The price for 甡记饼 (Shengji Cake) was 17.6 and 17.8 yuan. More than 30,000 futures cake sales were achieved. The price for 甡记饼 (Shengji Cake), June's 上栈单 (upper warehouse bill) trade in June was 18.7 yuan to 18.8 yuan, and it then again fell to 18.35 yuan. The closing price for June's 上栈单 (upper warehouse bill) trade in June was 19.45 yuan to 19.15 yuan. Today, 530 bags of bean and 750 bags of peanut were transported to Amoy (Xiamen). Also, 900 bags of sesame and 300 bags of beans were transported to Hong Kong.

### Silk and Tea: May New York Raw Silk Statistics

In May, the import of New York raw silk totaled 23,408擔 (dan), an increase of 401擔 (dan) from the previous month and an increase of 2,844擔 (dan) from the same month last year. Sales were 22,440擔 (dan), a decrease of 1,098擔 (dan) from the previous month and an increase of 2,443擔 (dan) from the same month last year. The inventory was 50,341擔 (dan), an increase of 968擔 (dan) from the previous month and an increase of 7,056擔 (dan) from the same month last year. From the above three figures, it can be seen that imports have increased but sales have not increased. Inventories have become abundant again, so the recent rise in silk prices has no basis. However, the tense situation in the Pacific is the main reason for the rise in silk market prices. Therefore, it can be predicted that overseas silk prices will shift with the increasing tension in the Pacific situation.

According to the May New York raw silk imports, Japanese silk was 19,690擔 (dan), Guangdong silk was 110擔 (dan), and Shanghai silk was 3,608擔 (dan). The inventory of Japanese silk was 42,646擔 (dan), European silk was 94擔 (dan), Guangdong silk was 1,498擔 (dan), and Shanghai silk was 6,103擔 (dan). The sales of Japanese silk were 1,847擔 (dan), European silk was 89擔 (dan), Guangdong silk was 612擔 (dan), and Shanghai silk was 3,261擔 (dan).

### Coal: Increase the Idea Yuan

The mature coal market had once fallen back a month ago, but recently, with coal briquette factories raising prices, it also had a rapid rise, and the market heard of it. The inter-trade dismantling price of coal lump has risen from 430 yuan per ton to 450 yuan. If adding the "increase the idea yuan" market, it also requires separately adding labor for delivery. So, the prices of the shop were also elevated, and retail per dan (traditional unit of weight) was 4 yuan.

### Cotton (4)

— Gao Jianong

There is conclusive evidence that ancient Egyptians not only knew cotton, but also cultivated it. Regarding whether the cloth they used was made of hemp or cotton, European scholars once had a fierce debate: It seems that the meeting of this cloth character can fundamentally include the above two types. Taking the true relics as evidence, archaeologists have found cotton seeds in the cliff tombs of ancient Egyptians. The burial cloth wrapped in mummies has also been found to contain cotton components. To investigate the traces of cotton from the text, the oldest record is Esther (Livre d’Esther) in the old canon, written in the fifth century BC. This describes the luxury and grandeur of the Persian King Assuerus's display in the royal garden – that is, Xerxes, who failed to attack Greece in 480 AD. The original text says: “In the third year of his reign,… he also held a grand banquet for the large and small people of Susa city (Susa) for seven days: In the royal garden, “white cotton” and red-purple curtains were suspended on silver rings or marble corridor [ ] with white and red linen strips." At the same time, snippets about cotton can also be found in the writings of Herodotus (484 to 425 BC), the father of European history. In 79 AD, Pliny the Elder, a great Roman scientist who died from forcedly watching the great view of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, also had a description of cotton in his naturalist.

### Foreign Countries Also Have Bedbugs

— Wu Dai

In the past three years, what Shanghai residents have felt most acutely is the exploitation by landlords of two- and three-room houses and the manipulation of the market by rice and coal merchants. Regarding rice, the concession authorities have at least made some effort, and although it is not enough, it can be said that they have achieved considerable results. However, there has been no special action taken regarding coal and rent.

Even as Britain faces national difficulties, there are unscrupulous elements among London landlords and egg merchants who are taking advantage of the situation. This shows that "foreign countries also have bedbugs."

However, they have considerable ways of dealing with these "bedbugs." Initially, the Minister of Health, Mr. Brown, requested local authorities to protect tenants by law and impose appropriate penalties on landlords who raise rents and exploit tenants. As a result, several landladies have already been fined by the court. One landlady was sued by a soldier's wife for raising the weekly rent from less than four pounds to eight pounds. Another apartment landlord was fined for raising the weekly rent from less than four pounds to twenty-eight pounds. Currently, in Britain, courts can impose fines of up to four hundred pounds on those who raise rents for refugee tenants.

To prevent unreasonable exploitation by landlords, the concession authorities may consider adopting similar measures.

### Secrets in the Desert

— Xia Niao

If your impression of the desert is just a barren expanse of yellow sand, sparsely inhabited by nomadic peoples living a primitive and barbaric life with their camels, then you are making a huge mistake. In fact, the desert has excellent organization and laws that govern unchanging customs. These laws fully express their great spirit of mutual assistance. However, only the natives of the desert know these things in detail, and because of language barriers, they rarely tell foreigners about them.

In the boundless Persian or Arabian deserts, the natives always gather in groups of ten or dozens, carrying a large herd of camels, traveling between various regions and tribes, selling their goods, and herding their livestock. During the journey, the camel, which is regarded as the "ship of the desert," does not occupy the primary position; the most important is the person, that is, the leader of each camel team, whom the natives call "Sheik or Chalwadar." When the camel team starts moving, he is the sole ruler and leader of the entire team. Everyone must obey his orders, and everything must be managed by him. This does not mean that he is a despotic tyrant or that he is rich and powerful, but because he has special skills and experience in the desert.

The leader of a camel team fully understands the nature of the desert. He knows all the water meadows and tribes within hundreds of miles. He can use his vision, smell, and hearing to determine directions in the seemingly uniform sand dunes. He can accurately determine the position of another camel team and determine what happened here not long ago from subtle changes in the color of the sand. Therefore, the leader of a camel team can truly be called a "desert expert" and a "new ruler of the desert." In the ocean of the desert, he feels safer than we do living within four walls. A newcomer will undoubtedly find his animal-like abilities magical.

A camel team without a leader is like a ship without a rudder or compass. It cannot proceed in the desert; otherwise, the danger is great because the desert only shows an endless expanse of sand, without any markers that can be used as a target for the road. If you do not have the ability to determine the direction, getting lost is unavoidable. However, if a leader is leading, then you can be bold and rest assured. Sometimes, if you get lost, he can also look at the surface of the desert soil and find the path like we turn over a map. However, the real danger is not getting lost. The most dangerous and terrifying thing is the quicksand. In many parts of the desert, the sand and mud are very loose and cannot bear even a little weight. However, the surface of these areas is no different from ordinary sand. When people and camels mistakenly enter the area, they sink deeply into the sand without a trace, just like falling into water. If you fall into the water, you can use lifebuoys and other methods to rescue yourself, but there is no way to deal with falling into quicksand. An experienced leader can identify the dangerous area ahead from a distance. Then, he will order the camel team to change direction and avoid this terrible quicksand.

In addition, the dangers in the desert include poisonous snake bites, bandit robbery, and lack of water. However, under the leadership of a good captain, water is not easily lacking, because he can smell it. When the drinking water carried by the camel team is about to run out, he climbs down from the camel hump, stands quietly on the sand for a few minutes, then turns his face to all sides to explore, deeply inhaling, and finally he shouts: "Northwest!" Then the entire camel team begins to move in the direction he specifies, and in a quarter of an hour or half an hour, or even several hours, it can always reach a place where springs are gurgling.

These magical abilities of the camel team leader seem to be only willing to be taught to apprentices and descendants. When an outsider asks about his method of identifying quicksand and water sources, he will playfully answer: "It's very simple! Anyone can do it."

In the desert, water and slender palm trees are the most sacred and inviolable. Everyone can fight fiercely with each other, tear a person apart with the most brutal means, plunder women and steal sheep, but palm trees and springs must be cherished and protected. If the people of a tribe destroy a water source, the people of the entire desert will rise up to oppose and attack this tribe that has committed a heinous crime until they move to another place.

In addition to water, food is also very important in the desert. Camel teams are mutually concerned about the food of each team. When camping in the evening, the light bread is prepared, and the captain always picks out a few pieces of fresh bread, wraps them in a wet cloth, and buries them deep in the sand; then he makes a mark on the ground with a small piece of wood. This bread is placed specifically to prevent other camel teams from lacking food. It can last a long time without spoiling under the sand, which is truly the savior of the desert. When a camel team is making progress in the desert, it can always encounter signs of hiding food. Sometimes the leader will dig them out and replace them with a few pieces of fresh bread. The news between the team leaders is transmitted by this bread. They engrave a specific symbol on the bread to report and convey various things, which can be said to be the strangest newspaper in the world.

In short, there is an excellent organization in the desert, and everyone can express a great spirit of mutual help, unlike a group of rice weevils and profiteers here, who only care about personal interests and forget the food needed by the public.

— Qin Shouou

(9) A Peculiar Peasant

The first thing he did was to send away the servant who had come with him from Beijing, giving him a hundred yuan for travel expenses, as well as a letter of introduction. "You should still return to Beijing and use this letter to find Li Yufang, the owner of Li, who probably won't treat you badly..."

After Old You left, he himself took off his gown and followed his cousin and others to work in the fields.

By the third spring, he readily settled the vendetta against that living Zhang Lai Li Chou; he knew that only by trying his best to reduce the field, while desperately working, could he make others no longer think that he was a wealthy landlord, and at the same time, he could keep the six thousand yuan in savings to cultivate his beloved daughter well.

He had such a plan, and Old Master Wu was completely sympathetic, but his cousin and the milkmaid's husband, Wang Si, both felt a little uneasy. Originally, human nature is cheap, and there is no problem with working hard and eating frugally all the time. As long as they are slightly more comfortable, they will inevitably complain if they are asked to suffer again.

Meibao was indeed a child with extraordinary talent. When she was able to eat and dress herself, she refused to sleep with the milkmaid anymore. Every night, like a little cat, she would lie behind the begonias, making a lovely, slight snoring sound. From the second year onwards, Qiu Haitang had removed the gauze from her face because she often had to work in the fields, revealing two wide scars. The skin on both sides lifted up, the color was red with purple, and purple with red. Every child who saw it would cover their face, afraid to look at him; but Meibao acted as if she hadn't seen it, often throwing herself into his arms, putting her apple-like little face against her grandfather's cheek, and holding his neck tightly for a long time without letting go.

Because she no longer needed the milkmaid to take care of her, Old Master Wu ordered the milkmaid to do some heavier work at home or in the fields. At first, she was still very willing because of Qiu Haitang's kindness to her, and Meibao was still very close to her, so they managed to get through two years peacefully. (130)

### Gas Protection Preparations

— Ke Zhong

This is a sentinel from the Central Army Cleaning Team in full protective gear, you can say he is making a fuss, or you can say he is preventing trouble before it happens.

In this European War, although both Britain and Germany have not yet used poisonous gas, they are both preparing to deal with the other side's use of poisonous gas. Not only soldiers, but also civilians have gas masks.

The most interesting thing about this sentry in the picture is not his steel helmet, nor his gas mask, nor his gas suit, but a piece of paper on his bayonet. This piece of paper is made through chemical procedures, and it will change color when there is poisonous gas in the air, so that the sentry knows that the other side has released poisonous gas.

### Review of the Current Situation of Shanghai Storytelling (Part 1)

— Di

In the past two years, the storytelling scene in Shanghai had a flourishing new atmosphere, but by last year, this new atmosphere slowly withered and declined, and recently it has become lively and prosperous again. According to the author's investigation, there are currently more than a dozen storytelling venues. The more notable ones are selected below, with detailed lineups:

Dongfang Storytelling Venue currently only has daytime performances (starting at 1:30 PM), with a total of five sessions: Han Shiliang's "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants," Zhong Ziliang's "The Legend of Yue Fei," Zhou Yuquan's "Yu Qingting," Chen Xuefang and Wei Hanyang's "Pearl Tower," and He Sheng's "Painted Gold Phoenix."

### Director of the "Ancient Temple Dream" Dance Drama Speaks

— Bai Ding

Recently, a reporter learned about the upcoming performance of the dance drama "Ancient Temple Dream" and immediately went to meet the composer and conductor, A.F. Sharomov, to gain some insight into the theories behind the drama.

A.F. Sharomov is a Russian, a renowned "China expert" musician, intimately familiar with our country's Peking Opera. From his silver hair and lively blue eyes, one can understand the depth of his experience.

After introductions and Mr. Jiang Chunfang's Russian translation, our conversation began.

For the sake of brevity, I will omit the reporter's own questions. His answers can be unified into the main concepts of the entire article:

The "dance drama" "Ancient Temple Dream" aims to establish a truly beautiful and good "Chinese dance drama" based on Chinese dance postures and Chinese music. Its task is not only to revive ancient Chinese music and old dances, but also to further develop Chinese music and Chinese dance. This so-called development is not about creating a completely new kind of music and dance, but about establishing modern Chinese national music and dance while not abandoning Chinese national characteristics.

"In order to establish a modern "Chinese dance drama" with national characteristics, modern Western orchestral instruments are used to play Chinese musical melodies and harmonies.

'Chinese Peking Opera is classical and conservative. Mei Lanfang once prepared to make reforms in both music and dance, but was stopped due to opposition from the conservative factions surrounding him. This time, the performers of "Ancient Temple Dream" are Peking Opera practitioners. They can accept the baptism of new art and completely overcome traditional habits. Therefore, the artistic mission that Peking Opera has difficulty undertaking, dance drama can help develop.'

Finally, he said very sincerely:

" 'Ancient Temple Dream' is still full of classical colors in form, but the symbolic meaning is very strong. In the future, I plan to go deep into the mainland to investigate the customs and people of various parts of China, so that the "Chinese dance drama" can be more modern and more folk-based.

At the same time, I hope that Chinese youth will not be too Westernized in their musical direction. Everyone should value our own country's music. Chinese music has extremely high value in the world."

### Night Light Troupe's Premiere of "Shanghai Nights"

— Wan Qian

This year, drama seems to be doing quite well in Shanghai. Last Sunday, the Night Light Troupe—an amateur troupe organized by people in the education sector—performed "Shanghai Nights" at the Lafayette Theater. There were over a thousand audience members, many young men and women, resembling a variety show held in a church hall.

The play "Shanghai Nights" is also one of Yu Ling's famous works, with little room for criticism. It satirizes the dark side of the Isolated Island period quite effectively. It is said that the director invited several established drama and film practitioners to help, and spent more than two months rehearsing, so the performance was generally very good.

My cousin Qin Wenqian, who has always been a very quiet person, actually stepped onto the stage this time. Although she didn't play a "minor character" type of role, it was still a miracle to me. In terms of the actors, in my personal opinion, Ke Xi's Zhou Yungu was the most successful. Her Mandarin was also better than anyone else's, but she was a little stage-shy in the first few minutes of her appearance. The most lively expression should be attributed to He Ji's Wu Ji. Every move was so natural, very much like a "veteran."

Little sister Xiao Qin, because she is a little sister, was of course particularly popular with the audience, but her performance was really good too. In addition, Qian Kaizhi played by Tang Qiao, Li Ma played by Li Ma, Mei E'hui played by Ling Zhi, and Mei's mother played by Ren Zhen, although they were all on stage for the first time and showed some "awkwardness," I admire the saying "watching others carry burdens is easy," so I must say it was already very commendable.

This Sunday, they plan to perform again at the same venue. I think the results will be even better, right?

### Artistic Highlights

— Wen

Following "Heartbroken Flower," Wang Yin will not only perform in "Dragon Struggle Tiger Fight" with Liu Huantai, but will also direct a film for Guolian. It is said that the script has been named "Loose Woman," and the entire play narrates the various abnormal dynamics of urban women, so the film is purely a social satire.

Following "Beauty Trap," the Hong Kong Nanyang Company has also shipped the horror film "Mystery Man in the Secret Room" to Shanghai. It is said that the film stars Tan Yulan, one of the four beauties of Hong Kong Island, and it is also said that the film will be screened at the Shanghai Guang Cinema in early next month.

The entire cast of the costume drama "Dragon Pool Tiger's Den" produced by the United States Company has been decided. They include Wang Xichun, Huang He, Tu Guangqi, and the famous actor Li Changshan. It is also said that Huang Naishuang will also make a cameo appearance as the Empress Dowager in the film.

Chapter 10: Gongsun's Sword Energy, Part 1

After the banquet, Wang Yongtai accompanied the man to the residence of General Zhou Yuji to pay a visit. Zhou Yuji had already heard Wang Yongtai praise Liu Yinying's handsome appearance and ability, so he was very polite when he received him, and invited him to sit and talk in the inner study. He saw that Liu Yinying's appearance was handsome, and he was indeed a young hero, and immediately wanted to grant him the position of Yunqi Lieutenant, wanting him to serve under his command along with Xu Jing. However, Liu Yinying declined, saying: "I am naturally lazy and have no desire for fame. Please forgive me for not being able to serve under your command for the time being. If there is a need, I will come to listen to your dispatch. I hope the general will forgive my disobedience." Zhou Yuji said: "Since Mr. Liu does not want to seek fame, I cannot force you. But I heard that Li Zicheng and other bandits have wild ambitions, and their momentum is very strong. After breaking Tongguan and occupying Xi'an, they called themselves King Chuang and their ambitions are not small. Recently, they led their people into Shanxi and have approached Taiyuan. If Taiyuan falls into the hands of the bandits, we here will hardly be able to keep a clean land. This general has the responsibility to defend the territory and has rectified the three armies, vowing to defend it to the death. Last night, we captured an assassin. After interrogating him, we learned that the bandit chief is very wary of me commanding the troops here, so they have learned the details and used the strategy of their military advisor Niu Jinxing, secretly dispatching three warriors to Daizhou to assassinate me and the old hero Wang. They thought that after the two of us were assassinated, they could divide their troops to peek, and drive straight down to Daizhou and Ningwu. Since the bandit chief is paying special attention to this general and others, they will definitely invade sooner or later, and there will inevitably be a bloody battle. The old hero Wang is my right-hand man, and Mr. Xu has just come to me, enough to be the basis for this general's reliance. But now there is an urgent need for talent, the more the better, so if Mr. Liu can help, this would be the general's great hope." Liu Yinying said: "I have no talent or ability, but I am very grateful for the general's attention. If the bandits come to invade, I will naturally do my best to serve the general and repay his kindness." Zhou Yuji nodded and smiled slightly. " 'Gaining a hundred pounds of gold is not as good as gaining Ji Bu's promise.' Since Mr. Liu said so, I am comforted. If we can defeat the bandits, it will be the good fortune of the people of Daizhou, and also the blessing of the imperial court. Today we have the rare opportunity to meet, let's have a small gathering in the yamen with wine and talk about our innermost feelings." (87)
