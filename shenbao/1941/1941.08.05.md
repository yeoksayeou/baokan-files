### Australian Naval Minister Hughes Announces: British Fleet Will Increase Defense of the Far East to Effectively Defend in Case of Emergency – Direct Warning to Japan Against Further Southern Advance

Reuters, Sydney, 4th – Australian Naval Minister Hughes stated yesterday that the aid provided by the United States to Britain would allow Britain to send its fleet to the Pacific when needed. Minister of Land Forces, Spender, stated that Australians must prepare for imminent danger and that Australia must reach its maximum military strength as soon as possible. The increase in Australia's military efficiency over the past three to four months is a clear demonstration of Australia's intent. Troops are now ready all day and can all depart at any time. Australia has adopted important plans to deal with serious situations. However, there is still a lot of frivolity throughout Australia. When the dark clouds gradually gather, we should stop entertaining ourselves. Foreign Minister Stewart also spoke to correct the impression in some quarters that Australia was not as actively involved in economic restrictions against Japan as other self-governing dominions, stating that since 1936, there had been no commercial treaty between Australia and Japan, only trade arrangements, so there was no need for formal communication.

Reuters, Singapore, 4th – Australian Naval Minister Hughes' declaration that Britain could dispatch a fleet to the Pacific if necessary has caused great excitement here. All parties expect the effectiveness of Britain in dealing with Japanese aggression, which has been greatly diminished due to the lack of a strong British fleet in the Pacific. Although it is generally believed that the United States will send its fleet to join any conflict in the Pacific in the event of a confrontation with Japan, the news that the British fleet can also participate will undoubtedly have a more reassuring effect. Anyone knows that it will take some time for Britain to send a fleet to the Far East, but all believe that the strong British military power now in the Far East can provide effective defense in any emergency, pending the arrival of the fleet. It is expected that after the British fleet arrives, Britain's attitude in this part of the world will quickly change from defensive to offensive. Chinese sources here frankly admit to being deeply impressed by this firm expression from Britain. According to a prominent Chinese person speaking to a Reuters reporter, Britain has unhesitatingly imposed sanctions on Japan due to the Vietnam issue. Now that Japan has begun to threaten Thailand, Britain has made the above declaration, which can be regarded as a direct threat to Japan against further advances.

Reuters, Rangoon, 4th – A team of elite soldiers selected from British and Australian troops stationed in Malaya arrived in Rangoon yesterday for forest warfare training. This team will train in Burma with newly organized independent units, enabling them to conduct lightning strikes in enemy territory. The war in Abyssinia has provided a precedent for the successful operation of such independent units. Burma has various terrains suitable for forest warfare training. The arrival of the Malayan elite and the establishment of special training demonstrate the close cooperation of the Eastern Command in defense. When the first batch of Australian soldiers arrived here from Malaya, Lieutenant General Macleod personally boarded the ship to welcome them.

United Press, Tokyo, 4th – Although tensions between the United States and Japan have increased over the past week due to mutual economic retaliation, there are continuous rumors in Tokyo today that the United States and Japan may be engaged in negotiations to establish a compromise in the Far East. It is said that Japan hopes the United States will recognize Japan's position as a leader in the East, and Japan is willing to adopt a more moderate policy towards democratic countries and is willing to cease further aggression. As of now, efforts to establish a compromise between the United States and Japan are only in the exploratory stage. However, what is noteworthy is that Japan does not take the opportunity of the United States freezing Japanese assets to worsen relations between the two countries, but rather adopts a more moderate policy. This can be seen in the essay written by Finance Minister Ogura, stating that Japan is willing to relax the freeze, provided that the United States is willing to act in the same way. It is generally believed here that relations between the United States and Japan have now reached the worst stage in history. However, it is solemnly pointed out that Japan is now at a crossroads and must make a decisive decision, either choosing a final policy that reverses its previous actions, or resolutely joining the Axis powers. It is also pointed out that the current government of Japan is actually composed of retired naval leaders, who have significant business interests and advocate friendship with countries that can trade with Japan, rather than just countries that have political relations with Japan, because Japan cannot obtain any assistance from the latter in times of crisis. Although there have been many hostile reactions here to the United States freezing Japanese assets, the reaction of some people is actually more moderate. Even the reactions that exist are only for domestic interests. If the current reactions are analyzed, it indicates that Japanese public opinion in general is moderate and friendly. One side suggests mutually easing the freeze, while the other side assures the Japanese people that the government is prepared to deal with the consequences of the severance of trade with the United States. The "Hochi Shimbun" wrote in its commentary today, "We have already decided to develop our power peacefully in the south to resist the encirclement of Britain and the United States and to cope with any threats of alliance."

### The US and Japan are Still Bargaining

The sudden return of Mr. Nomura's advisor from Washington to Japan is generally believed here to be related to Nomura's mediation plan. Authoritative sources point out that if the United States and Japan can carefully explore the possibility of mutual rapprochement, the situation will be very delicate, because both countries are willing to obtain the most favorable position for bargaining. Therefore, it is believed that the United States and Japan will publicize extensively, each claiming that its policies have not changed. In this regard, the general public can divide the policy and diplomacy. The so-called policy in Japan's mind is to establish peace and cooperation in East Asia to avoid the spread of the European war to East Asia. This matter has no fundamental relationship with the Tripartite Pact, but is only an expedient diplomatic measure. A reporter from the "Asahi Shimbun" interviewed Mr. Sumida, the chief military representative sent by Japan to Vietnam. Sumida said that Japan's "East Asia New Order" proposal has been "completed" by concluding a joint defense agreement with Vietnam. This coincides with what some Japanese newspapers have said, that the Vietnam move is to "ensure the safety of Japan's back door," and that Japan will not make further southward aggression. At the same time, the "Kokumin Shimbun" optimistically predicted that Japan has a very good possibility of establishing a new agreement with the Dutch East Indies, at which time Japan can obtain Dutch East Indies oil peacefully. Therefore, the British and American diplomatic circles are extremely concerned about an early rapprochement with Japan. They point out that the consistent tactic of the Axis powers is to announce that they will no longer exert further pressure after each major action. We have good reason to believe that the current economic pressure Japan is suffering should be weighed on its government leaders. From this perspective,

### Japan's Finance Minister Wishes to Negotiate with the US

As Ogura recently announced in the "Nichinichi Shimbun" to Washington, if the United States can recognize the human and financial resources Japan has spent on establishing the "East Asia New Order," Japan is willing to discuss with the United States. However, he also pointed out that Japan must be compensated for this loss. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Germany's influence in Japan has weakened, because Japan has obviously gradually acted on its own and pursued an independent policy. This is also considered extremely certain by German Ambassador Wirth. Related to this is Germany's sudden "recognition" of the "Nanjing regime," which is quite noteworthy. We can guess that its intention is to appease the Japanese, because the Japanese have always hoped that the Germans would attack Britain, not the Soviet Union. This incident has now forced Japan to stop its economic negotiations with the Dutch East Indies, creating the recent economic pressure of the joint British and American sanctions against Japan. Hochi Shimbun reporter Muto said that General Nomura intended to improve US-Japan relations, but the result was the opposite. The Americans have reached a conclusion that Japan cannot oppose the United States no matter what. He also said that as the US blockade against Japan becomes increasingly severe, this policy, if continued, could even create a misunderstanding, "believing that we are currying favor." He said, "This is not the success of Nomura's diplomacy. The real reason why the United States does not dare to challenge Japan with force is the lack of preparedness of the US Navy." The "Yomiuri Shimbun" repeatedly focuses on the US-Soviet relations in the Far East, believing that once the US and Soviet Union approach each other and establish a military agreement in the Far East, they will tighten the blockade of Japan. The United States' supply of oil to the Soviet Union is enough to show that Washington has decided to take the Pacific route and no longer cares about Japan's relationship with the Tripartite Pact. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also said that the compensation obtained by the United States for assisting the Soviet Union is to find a base in Kamchatka and take possession of the Aleutian Islands to transport troops to Alaska.

International News Service, Washington, 4th – Washington officials stated that if Japan does not see Germany gain a decisive advantage in the Soviet war by mid-May, it will re-establish friendly relations with the United States. There are two reasons for this view: (1) Japan does not intend to seize oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies at the risk of going to war with democratic countries; (2) The US embargo on gasoline and oil can fatally strike Japan's combat power. For this reason, Japan will soon realize that when the German-Soviet conflict becomes a war of attrition, it will suggest to the United States to ease the oil embargo policy.

### Japanese Newspapers Report That China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are Taking Measures to Defend Against Japan, Building Large Airfields in China and the Three Countries Supplying Aircraft and Pilots

Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 4th – The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun carried a report from its Hanoi correspondent stating that Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China are jointly resisting Japan, and the main measures are as follows: (1) Building an American airfield in southwestern China at a cost of US$40 million; (2) Sending 600 British and American aircraft to serve in southwestern China; (3) Dispatching 200 British and American pilots and 100 Soviet pilots to serve in southwestern China; (4) Expediting the construction of the railway connecting Siberia and Lanzhou to see its early completion.

### Thailand and Vietnam to Conduct Border Demarcation in Early September

Reuters, Tokyo, 4th – The Japanese news agency Domei reported from Saigon that Vietnam and Thailand, in accordance with the recently concluded Franco-Thai armistice, will begin border demarcation work in early September. The Japanese representative of the Franco-Thai Boundary Commission is currently staying at a hotel and is discussing everything with the French Commission. The Thai representative of the Boundary Commission is scheduled to arrive in Saigon on August 6, so a plenary meeting is expected to be held around August 10. The Commission will discuss and decide on the specific procedures for border demarcation in August.

### Long Yun Meets with Reporters to Discuss Japan's Recent Movements, Stating that the Recent Occupation of Saigon is in Preparation for its Southern Advance, and it Dares Not Advance North Before the German-Soviet War Reaches a Decisive Stage. If It Invades China, It Will Either Take Kunming Directly or Cut Off the Yunnan-Burma Transportation Route.

Kunming, July 29 (Airmail) – Recently, the international situation has undergone rapid changes due to the German-Soviet war, and Japan's recent movements have attracted more attention. Long Yun, Director of the Kunming Provisional Headquarters, met with reporters and made a statement, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Japan's recent occupation of Saigon is only in preparation for its southward advance, and it will definitely take action soon. In terms of northward advancement, it will definitely not dare to act rashly before the German-Soviet war reaches a decisive stage. It is hoped that the two major democratic countries of Britain and the United States can take advantage of this opportunity to use the combined strength of their navies to give a fatal blow to the ringleader of Far East aggression, so that not only can the interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East be ensured, but the peace and order of the Pacific can also rely on this to be stabilized. (2) The Franco-Japanese Vietnam Joint Defense Agreement poses a great threat to us and to Britain and the United States. If the enemy wants to take this opportunity to invade us, regardless of its own strength, and open up a new battlefield in our southwest, its route will undoubtedly be: a) Take Kunming directly; b) Invade Burma from Thailand, and cut off the Yunnan-Burma transportation route in the vicinity of Mandalay. As for the general view that the enemy may directly take XX and other places, (taking action within the western Yunnan border) is an uninformed discussion of geography and terrain, and inevitably involves mobilizing troops and planning afar. If the enemy advances from that road, either invading from Simao to the Lancang River, or circumventing from Jinghong in Thailand, its journey is twice as far as from Hanoi to Kunming. Finally, when reporters inquired about the defense measures against Japanese actions in the Yunnan border recently, Long smiled and said, "Hua Fang had already arranged this matter according to the original plan, but it is related to military affairs, so please forgive me for not answering."

### Sichuan Silk to Be Improved

Chongqing – A Chinese observer suggested today that Sichuan Province is the easiest to develop and make it another source of silk for the United States, to replace Japan. Sichuan is the third largest silk-producing region in China. The reason why it has not been able to achieve an important position in exports in the past is because the quality of Sichuan silk has not reached the standard and American machinery has not been used. Chinese sources say that experts want to improve the silkworm breeds here, which is very easy, and better machines should be used so that the products can meet the needs of the United States.

### US Assistant Secretary of State to Come to the Far East for Investigation, Main Destination Being the Philippines, and Will Also Go to China, the Dutch East Indies, etc.

United Press, Washington, 4th – Reliable sources announced today that Assistant Secretary of State Grady will soon be ordered to go to the Far East to study and adjust the pressure exerted by the democratic countries on the Axis powers in the Far East. Grady's mission will focus on the Philippines. Grady will examine the economic situation of the Philippines to determine (1) its possible response when war occurs in the Pacific, (2) its needs in the current situation of ship shortages and reduced export markets, (3) the possibility of saving its economy with agricultural loans and other assistance. Reliable sources know that when Grady inspects the Philippines, he will be assisted by Hayesdegar, the economic advisor to the US High Commissioner in the Philippines, Sayre. The various situations Grady examines will be kept strictly confidential. It is understood that Grady will take a clipper from San Francisco to Manila on August 12, stay there for two weeks, and then go to the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, Burma, and possibly Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Chongqing. Sources familiar with the situation are extremely cautious about this part of Grady's mission, but said that Grady will definitely discuss with economic experts from various countries, and then compile a list of economic assets and local institutions, as well as prepare to be used when taking specific actions, such as oil embargoes, financial cooperation, or controlled shipping. The same sources announced that the Ministry of Finance has also dispatched banking experts to implement the freeze order and supervise the transactions of Japanese banks in the territory. They will not take action automatically, but, like Grady, will provide factual basis for the United States to take further action when diplomatic policy requires it.

Editorial

### People in Shanghai Should Cultivate Composure

In the past ten days, the hearts of the people in Shanghai have been restless again, living in fear as if they could not live through the day. After studying the reasons for this, half of it is due to changes in the situation, and half is due to human causes. The sudden and drastic changes in the situation, such as the Japanese army's occupation of Vietnam and the freezing of Sino-Japanese funds by the United States and Britain, are all sufficient to trigger a major war in the South Pacific. A single hair can move the whole body, and may affect Shanghai's status, personal safety, and immediate interests. It is inevitable to have doubts and fears, which may still be understandable. However, if it is the shock caused by human beings, it is purely due to speculators stirring up trouble and creating rumors. The strangeness and bizarre nature of the news is something that is impossible in terms of reason, but it is also spread around and broadcast in the city. Often, relying only on private speculation, they rush to speak, and in no time, it becomes a "definite" piece of news. Listeners dare not reject its absurdity, and the speakers themselves also believe that there is a reason for it. So they question each other and then elaborate on it, the more they seek confirmation, the more distorted it becomes. The hearts of the people in society are agitated by it, unable to restrain their emotions, and increase their fears. This kind of man-made shock has a great impact and is extremely harmful. It is certainly pitiful to talk about it, but it is also unforgivable.

I have always had a feeling that the real factor in the restlessness of the people in Shanghai is the lack of composure. Composure means that the heart is focused on one state, immovable, unshakable, able to eliminate chaotic thoughts, and able to overcome difficulties. In short, it means that in any environment, with this composure, one has a consistent thought, a strong will, and is not changed by external things at all. Nowadays, it seems that people in Shanghai cannot easily obtain this kind of composure, and their nerves are abnormally sensitive. Every time a storm comes, not only is there no way to respond, but they also stir up trouble themselves. They often cause some disasters due to unnecessary panic and suspicion. Taking prices as an example, prices were not high at first, but because of worries that there might be a sharp rise one day, they prepared for a month, and now they are accumulating a year's worth of needs. All food, fuel, and daily necessities are rushed to hoard, as a way to solve all problems once and for all. They do not know that with this restless mentality, they are enough to stimulate the rise in prices. Demand loses its balance, and prices soar. And the speculators who hoard goods then add fuel to the fire, so life becomes more expensive day by day, which cannot be stopped, and the common people suffer. All of this is due to the restlessness of the people and the lack of composure.

As for Shanghai's current position, Shanghai's future is indeed worrying, but there are also things that are not worrying. Shanghai is a city with internationality, and its commercial interests are shared by all countries. Not only should the Chinese cherish it, but also the British, Americans, and people from other countries should care about it. Should Shanghai be destroyed one day, it would be an unfortunate event for the Chinese, but would it be a blessing for the British, Americans, and other countries? We infer that Shanghai's status should not be limited to Shanghai itself, but should be viewed from a broader and larger perspective. The greatest desire of those who are generally recognized as plotting against Shanghai lies outside Shanghai. If their plans fail, Shanghai will not be harmed. If their plans succeed, how can Shanghai be spared? Nowadays, the division between the democratic front and the aggressor countries is clear. From the perspective of the democratic countries, what we hope for is the final victory of the democratic front, without having to focus on temporary gains and losses, and temporary peace. Only those who have composure can have this expectation, and can only obtain this final light.

There are also some subtle events that are caused by worry and fear. For example, a certain action may not have had this intention at the beginning, but people speculate wildly, thinking that it will happen one day, and those who like to make a big deal out of things will make various preparations, citing legal principles and criticizing it severely, as if the matter is about to happen imminently. Let us think about it, in this situation, those who have intentions, even if they do not want to take action, it is almost impossible. Thus, rumors that have no basis in fact become reality. "There is nothing wrong in the world, but fools trouble themselves," all due to the restlessness of the people.

We live on an isolated island, living in peace and happiness. Once we think of our compatriots who are displaced and wandering, and we reflect on ourselves in the middle of the night, we feel ashamed and intertwined. If we do not strive to rise up, but worry about our own gains and losses, what is this? Today, there is almost no peaceful land in the world. Seeking absolute safety cannot be achieved by luck, nor can it be achieved by one person or a few people, nor can it be sought by those who are nervous and worried all day long. We must rely on ourselves, rely on our own country, and seek long-term peace and stability, not temporary peace.

Here, I should tell the people of Shanghai that we should engage in cultivating composure and eliminating the mentality of restlessness. The cultivation of composure must start with strengthening our beliefs, because without beliefs, composure cannot be born. If we have strong beliefs, we can set a correct and bright goal, pray for it, and do our best to achieve it. Any difficulties and hardships can be dealt with calmly, and any worries and anxieties can be strongly restrained. Why disturb each other for nothing?

### Foreign Minister Guo's Report on the Recent International Situation at the Central Memorial Week: England and the United States Consistently Strengthen the Anti-Aggression Front, Democratic Countries Thoroughly Economically Block Japan, Which Will Inevitably Collapse

Chongqing - The Central Joint Memorial Week was held on the morning of the 4th. President Chiang presided over the ceremony. After the ritual, Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi reported in detail on the diplomatic and international situation in the month since taking office. The main points of Minister Guo's report are recorded as follows: "The second major event since I took office was the severance of diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy, which made the positions of the two democratic and axis camps even clearer: one of aggression and one of anti-aggression. Following this, England and the Soviet Union established a military mutual assistance agreement. Although the Anglo-Soviet agreement is limited to Europe, the British Prime Minister declared in the House of Commons that England and the Soviet Union are in an alliance. The United States also officially announced its active assistance to the Soviet Union and sent a special envoy, Hopkins, to Moscow for consultations. Thus, the Soviet Union, which has been helping our country resist aggression, officially joined the anti-aggression front. The joint front of China, the United States, England, and the Soviet Union can be considered fully established and can work together to strive for victory. In these world changes, Japan has been truly fickle. Its attitude towards England, the United States, and the Soviet Union has changed several times and is self-contradictory. The recent second collapse of the Konoe cabinet showed their embarrassing state of indecision. Since the July 7th Incident, the Japanese people have changed six cabinets, while our country has always been under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, implementing its consistent policy with unwavering determination. Now, it is gaining more support, while the Japanese are increasingly isolated and in a difficult situation. The trend of their advantages and disadvantages, success and failure, is now becoming increasingly clear. However, we must pay attention to the fact that the Japanese still want to rely on the Axis powers to realize their ambition of dominating East Asia and carving up the Pacific. After Germany and Italy recognized Nanjing, the President judged that Japan would definitely take a new adventurous move. Sure enough, the Japanese pressured the Vichy government and advanced into Vietnam. Their purpose, in addition to currying favor with Germany and Italy, is to expand the aggression against Vietnam, make the entire territory of Vietnam a Japanese military occupation area, and spy on Thailand, Burma, and our Yunnan. Thirdly, it is to prepare a starting point for threatening Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines in the future. They were confident that bullying the defeated France would not provoke action from England and the United States. Unexpectedly, this speculative move triggered extremely serious repercussions from England and the United States. England and the United States unanimously gave them the most severe economic sanctions. Now, the United States' attitude towards Japan is completely the same as its attitude towards England's enemies, Germany and Italy. The British Empire has also taken parallel steps with the United States towards Japan, further cooperating in the Pacific and strengthening the anti-aggression front. This point is worthy of our attention and gratification. England, the United States, and the Netherlands have already officially announced the deposit of Japanese funds. England and the United States have also, at our country's request, frozen our country's funds in England and the United States to prevent the Japanese from seizing foreign exchange. Recently, the United States announced an embargo on oil to Japan, and the United Kingdom announced the abolition of commercial treaties between various parts of the British Empire and Japan. From now on, Japan will not be able to access these vast markets in India, Australia, New Zealand, overseas colonies, Canada, and South Africa. If China, the United States, England, and the Soviet Union can make the economic blockade of Japan airtight, Japan will inevitably collapse economically. I have been in Europe for nine years and have personally witnessed the detailed process of the changing European situation. I feel that Japan is the main culprit in this worldwide catastrophe. After the previous Great War, countries around the world originally wanted to establish a permanent peaceful order based on the League of Nations. Japan was elected as one of the four permanent members of the council. Unexpectedly, it disregarded the importance of the trust, broke its promises, and took risks. In 1931, it launched an aggression against the three northeastern provinces of our country, first destroying the League of Nations, destroying the League of Nations, the non-war pact, and all international treaties, which led to this world war. From this, it can be proved that Japan is a country without credibility and absolutely cannot bear the responsibility of a first-class country in terms of political morality. In the future, in building a new world order, we must never trust such a country. It has completely lost the qualification to participate in the construction of a new world. At the same time, we see the evolution of the world situation in recent months, and we also deeply feel that Japan is the weakest link in the chain of the aggression group. As long as the democratic countries persist in and strengthen the economic blockade against it, it will soon move towards the path of collapse. The collapse of the Axis front will definitely first manifest in Japan, and the victory of the democratic group will definitely start in the Far East, without a doubt." (4th dispatch)

### Japanese Residents in Hong Kong to Withdraw Completely

Hong Kong - The Japanese Consul in Hong Kong, Yano, told reporters today that since the Hong Kong authorities issued the order to freeze funds, Japanese merchants here have been greatly affected. Although the Japanese government has not ordered the withdrawal of Japanese residents, the Japanese residents will eventually leave completely because of the great impact. However, this matter will be decided by the Japanese residents themselves. There are currently 500 Japanese residents in Hong Kong. The Japanese side has now asked the Hong Kong authorities to explain their attitude towards Japanese ships traveling to and from Hong Kong. (4th dispatch)

### England and the Soviet Union to Conduct Large-Scale Joint Operations in the Far North, Large British Naval Contingent Arrives in the Arctic Ocean, Germany Also Prepares for Third Blitzkrieg

Reuters, London, 4th - Finnish newspapers recently reported that England and the Soviet Union may conduct large-scale joint operations in the Arctic Ocean. Responsible parties in London believe that the German High Command is currently preparing for a third decisive blitzkrieg in an attempt to break through the Soviet army's resolute resistance. This is why the Eastern European front has become more stable in the past week. Many believe that the Nazi's third offensive may be a turning point in the war. The current situation is favorable to the Soviet Union, as the Soviet army's lines of communication are now properly maintained, unlike the German army's. The Soviet army only needs to keep its lines of communication intact to be in an advantageous position when the third test comes. As far as the German army is concerned, the deeper it goes into the Soviet Union, the greater its difficulties will be. One thing that can be predicted now is that if the German army's currently planned third blitzkrieg fails, it will be very unsuccessful. When winter comes, it will be inconvenient for the German army to operate, and it will be easily attacked by the Soviet army, which is accustomed to the harsh winter climate of the Soviet Union. At the same time, Finnish newspapers reported that a large British naval contingent has arrived in the Arctic Ocean, and a large Soviet army is also concentrating in the north. This shows that the British air raid on Petsamo was not an accidental attack, but part of a large-scale joint operation plan between England and the Soviet Union in the Nordic regions. According to Finnish news, the activity of the Soviet army on the entire Finnish front is increasing, especially north of Lake Ladoga, where the Soviet army has repeatedly attacked. The Finnish side admits that although Sortavala is under Finnish artillery fire on nearby small islands, it is still in the hands of the Soviet army. The Finnish side believes that the reason why the Soviet army is determined to defend Sortavala is to protect the necessary retreat route through the territory, as transportation on Lake Ladoga is quite dangerous.

Red Army Gains Combat Experience, Resistance Grows Stronger

News from Hanko reports little other news except that fresh Soviet troops have arrived one after another. However, the Swiss capital believes that the Soviet army in Estonia is under heavy pressure and is currently retreating to 결戈. Other fronts seem to have few changes, only German sources report that the war is now taking place further east. A Soviet official reviewed the Eastern Front situation in a news report, stating that the struggle of the 　Fascist army has now entered a new stage of fierce battles to determine the battle situation, but it has already shown that Hitler's all-out, one-shot blitzkrieg has been defeated. However, we do not mean that the German Fascist army has been defeated, because the enemy army is still stubborn, and although its manpower and equipment have suffered heavy losses, it is still trying to invade new territories. Our army is calmly responding to the battle, allowing the Fascist tank corps to advance, then cutting off its connection with the infantry, and then thoroughly annihilating the enemy infantry. At the same time, we are using the air force to bomb its 조크 vehicle corps and destroy the enemy paratroopers who have landed. The enemy army has repeatedly used old tricks, attempting to encircle the Red Army units, but the Red Army bravely breaks through the encirclement and uses clever tactics to encircle and annihilate the enemy army instead. The Red Army has learned how to defeat the enemy army, and the strength of our army's resistance is growing stronger day by day, and fresh troops are constantly arriving at the front line, with unusual courage. The news report concluded by saying that the Soviet Union has gained practical combat experience in the forty days of war, and its superior qualities have been further enriched.

German Major Offensive from Arctic Ocean to Black Sea Has Halted

Reuters, London, 4th - A Reuters military commentator said that the Germans themselves have now admitted that the German major offensive against the Soviet Union on the entire front line from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea has now halted. It is now impossible to regroup and attack again in a decisive and large-scale manner. German military spokesmen and newspapers have said that the enemy army is not only numerous but also well-equipped, and the news obtained by London from various forces also confirms that the Soviet army is indeed powerful. The German side has now stated the facts. If the military situation is like this, the German army's strategic position in the Soviet Union is very precarious. Hard fighting, long journeys, and various supplies are in short supply, and the treatment of the wounded and dead is also delayed. All of these have a great impact on the German army's combat effectiveness. The German soldiers' escape and surrender to the Soviet side is now common, but in addition to this adversity, there is one thing that is most likely to shake morale, which is the realization of failure. When the army is advancing victoriously and the enemy is crumbling, it can bravely support itself despite all kinds of hardships and losses, because the 滕 army rarely cares about its wounds. But if it fails and the army is hindered, and failure is feared and victory is hopeless, then the fighting spirit will quickly disappear. Therefore, an offensive war that is confident of achieving a great victory, if it ends in failure and suffers many losses, is more likely to shake the support of the army than a defensive war that fails. This fact was seen in Germany's failure twenty-three years ago and will now be discovered again. Soon we will ask, "Can the German army hold out for another month or until winter?" In my opinion, it is almost impossible.

England Prepares to Strike Germany, Land and Air Forces to Launch Expedition in the Spring

The German army has been blocked on all fronts for half a month, and in this half month, fierce battles of a consuming nature have continued. The Soviet army in the far north has indeed driven back its enemy, and the British air raid on Petsamo and Kenks in northern Norway last Friday is indeed meaningful. This is a sign of Britain's close support for the Soviet army in the far north, so there may be developments in the far north in the future. The sea power of the Baltic Sea is still in the hands of the Soviet Union, which often destroys Nazi ships and still guards Hanko, and northern Estonia is still in Soviet hands. The Soviet army is currently engaging in a counterattack in the Smolensk region, but this is only a corner nature. A large-scale general counterattack has not yet been carried out. It will be weeks before a big one can be launched. Its direction is certainly unpredictable, but if a counterattack is launched in the Minsk area, it could achieve extremely decisive results. Judging from the information I have obtained, the Soviet Union still has a large number of well-equipped reserve forces, and the land and air forces stationed in Siberia to defend against Japan have not been calculated in. What will be the future of the Soviet front? It is certainly not possible to say at this time, but before October, it would not be surprising if the German army withdrew from all or part of the front line. Germany can only defend what it can defend in winter, while the Soviet Union will reorganize its large army in winter and prepare for an offensive in the spring. Britain will also prepare to strike Germany in several places on the European continent, and at that time, superior air and land forces will be ready to implement the expedition plan. There has been no act of war against Japan yet, but England and the United States have clearly understood that Japan's strength is far less than that of Germany, and its position is as dangerous as that of Germany. US Vice President Wallace recently said, "Whether there is a chance for peace with Japan now depends only on whether we express it with all kinds of actions and attitudes that we are completely willing to fight." This statement should be our policy towards Japan.

### British Submarine Fires Torpedoes, Bombards Italian Cruiser, One Ship Hit, Whether Sunk or Not Is Uncertain, German Airport on Crete Bombed

Reuters, London, 叫日 - Last night, the Central Navy Public Report stated that yesterday, an Italian cruiser equipped with six-inch guns was torpedoed twice by a British submarine in the Mediterranean. It immediately released smoke to protect itself. Several destroyers were then seen circling the place where the cruiser was hit. As for whether the cruiser sank or not, it could not be confirmed because it was covered by smoke. British submarines in the Mediterranean also torpedoed and sank two supply ships of 6,000 tons and 1,600 tons, less than a mile off the Italian coast, protected by Italian destroyers, and a floating dock towed by two tugboats and two torpedo boats were also attacked by the English submarine. The floating dock was hit by at least one torpedo.

Reuters, Cairo, 4th - The British Air Force in the Middle East announced today that on Saturday, a large number of German dive bombers, guarded by fighter planes, attacked British ships off the coast of North Africa. British fighter planes took off to intercept them, shooting down 叫架 enemy bombers and one fighter plane, and severely damaging several enemy planes. Three British fighter planes are missing. On Friday night, British bombers initially bombed enemy-occupied airfields on Crete. After Candia was attacked, there was a violent explosion, followed by a fire, indicating that the gasoline pile had been hit. After Maleimi was attacked, the bombs seemed to have hit an ammunition depot, causing explosions and fires, and thick smoke covered the sky. Also, on Friday morning, British bombers attacked enemy ships off the coast of Lampedusa Island. Two enemy merchant ships, each with a load of 300 tons, were hit by several bombs, and the enemy machine gun positions were also severely attacked. One Italian plane was destroyed and several were severely damaged at the Polizzo airfield in Sicily. Only one British plane that went out to fight did not return.

Reuters, London, 4th - According to information from the British Ministry of Aviation, on Saturday, a team of British four-engine and two-engine bombers attacked the center of Berlin and dropped a large number of bombs. The British fleet arrived outside Berlin at 1:30 am and began bombing at 1:94 am. When the British planes circled over Berlin, there were also some German bombers in the sky, so the land defenses could not focus on shooting at the British planes. After the bombs fell, there were three large explosions, and the fire rose like a volcanic eruption. The red light illuminated the sky, and it could still be seen 80 miles away. Hamburg and Kiel in Germany were also heavily attacked, no less than Berlin. Therefore, the battle on Saturday night caused heavy damage to the three major cities of Germany. This is the second time Berlin has been attacked since the British Air Force's summer offensive began.

Reuters, London, 叫日 - An Aviation Ministry bulletin stated that yesterday, the British Air Force dispatched to the Strait and the skies of northern France for offensive flights and attacked many enemy targets. Sea patrol boats, land planes, troops, artillery positions, and airfields were all subjected to low-flying strafing and bombing by British planes. Four enemy fighters were shot down, and one British plane did not return.

Reuters, London, 叫日 - An Aviation Ministry bulletin stated that yesterday afternoon, a German plane sneaked to a certain place on the southeast coast and dropped bombs, causing slight damage to the area. A British fighter plane shot down an enemy bomber in the skies over the Strait架.

### US Senator George Believes Japan Will Not Attack the Philippines, Japan Plans to Occupy Thailand and Vietnam to Attack British Territories, America Still Hopes to Avoid a Pacific War

United Press International, 4th - Washington - Retired Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator George, told a United Press reporter yesterday that if Japan takes any action in 赤南 in the future, it will definitely include attacking the滇缅 Highway. Senator George does not believe that Japan will attack the Philippines in the near future. He said, "I have never thought that Japan will attack the Philippines. Their course of action is very clear. They want to occupy Vietnam and Thailand, and then use these sections as bases to attack China or other British territories from the 滇缅 Highway." Joe also said that Japan's determination to occupy Vietnam and its recent decisions all show that it was deeply aware in advance that the United States would take economic retaliation. When Japan made these decisions, it obviously knew what kind of economic pressure the United States would take on Japan. He continued that the United States' policy will continue to be based on the hope of avoiding a Pacific war. He urged everyone to pay attention to the fact that the United States' order to restrict oil exports is not an absolute embargo on Japan, and predicted that after the adjustment of US-Japan relations, if Japan does not make any further aggression, the trade between the two countries will still be based on the pre-war situation, with a small amount of exchanges continuing.

### Japanese Deputy Envoy to the United States Returns Home to Report

Reuters, Washington, 4th - According to sources at the Japanese Embassy, the Japanese Deputy Envoy here, Wakasugi, has been ordered by the Japanese Ambassador Nomura to depart for Tokyo today to report on matters here to the Japanese government in person.

### Ukraine War in Progress: Soviet Forces Launch Fierce Counteroffensive; German Forces Divide to Probe Odessa

Reuters, London, 4th: The focus of the six-week-old Soviet-German war has suddenly shifted to the southern sector, where a new major battle is underway in Ukraine. The fate of Kyiv and Odessa hinges on the outcome of this campaign. Recent German reports acknowledge that Soviet forces have launched a fierce counteroffensive, and state that powerful German air forces have joined the battle. According to Berlin reports received by Su Lieke,

German Forces Halted

before Kyiv are now attempting to divide their forces to probe the Black Sea port of Odessa. The German high command's attention is now focused on the southern front. According to a Berlin dispatch from the Basler Nachrichten, German military sources claim that the German-Romanian allied forces in the extreme south have been ordered to advance on Odessa, having forcibly crossed the Dniester River at several points near its estuary. Further north, German and Romanian troops who have crossed the river opposite Kishinev are advancing in a southeasterly direction to join forces. Neither of these accounts has been confirmed by Moscow. Recent German reports of an "annihilation battle" taking place 150 miles south of Kyiv are likely related to the assault on Odessa. The claim of new battles south of Kyiv indicates that the German direct southwest assault on Kyiv failed, and they are now applying new pressure on Kyiv from the south in an attempt to resolve the battle for Kyiv. A Berlin dispatch from the Basler Nachrichten, criticizing the intensity of the fighting, states that news of the Soviet counteroffensive and holding actions indicates that the Soviet forces' fighting capacity or

Will to Resist

has not diminished. The dispatch also states that the German official announcement placing East Galicia under German civil administration as part of the Polish German government has dashed the hopes of Ukrainian nationalists that this area would become part of an independent Ukraine. General Buteni, commander of the Soviet forces in the southern sector, stated yesterday that German forces have formed a broad arc-shaped line west and south of Kyiv, extending from Korosten in the far north, south to Zhytomyr, where fierce fighting has taken place for days, and then southeast to Bila Tserkva (45 miles southwest of Kyiv). It is rumored that the German forces are launching a pincer movement in Ukraine aimed at cutting off the vital railway lines connecting central Russia with the Ukrainian mining region and Odessa. Ukraine has now become the main front, and news of continued fighting on the far northern front has arrived today. Finnish sources acknowledge that Soviet forces in that area are

Repeatedly Counterattacking

and there is also fighting on the Estonian and Baltic fronts. The situation in the central sector around Smolensk remains largely unchanged, and Smolensk itself remains in Soviet hands. The battle record of the Soviet 99th Division, which has been fighting continuously since the German invasion, has only now been revealed. The division has been repeatedly surrounded, but has always fought its way out, moving hundreds of miles eastward, and launching fierce counterattacks whenever the opportunity arises. In the first four weeks of the fighting, the division annihilated six German regiments. German propaganda now insists that Soviet guerrillas behind German lines must be eliminated before a major victory can be achieved. However, a Reuters dispatch from Moscow states that this is to

Prepare the Germans

for a longer war than they had anticipated. The activity of Soviet guerrillas has undermined German confidence and greatly frustrated German troops accustomed to following plans. According to a Soviet naval announcement, Soviet forces have sunk at least eleven enemy submarines, nine destroyers, twelve transport ships, three oil tankers, and one munitions ship in the Baltic and Black Seas.

### Soviet Mechanized Troops Fight Valiantly to Defend Kyiv, Containing Large-Scale Attacks from Two Directions; Heavy Losses for Elite German Units

International News Agency, Moscow, 4th: It was announced here today that Soviet tank columns, infantry, and cavalry are fighting valiantly to defend Kyiv, preventing it from being encircled by German forces. Yesterday, they successfully repelled large-scale attacks from two directions against Kyiv. Elite German units suffered heavy losses in the face of fierce Soviet counterattacks, and many retreated. Large numbers of Soviet tanks and two regiments of mechanized Soviet infantry flanked and annihilated two German regiments in the Zhytomyr area. The battle lasted six hours, with over 1,500 German soldiers killed. The remaining 340 officers and soldiers surrendered to the Soviet side. The commander of the Southern Front is reportedly deploying infantry, cavalry, tanks, and mechanized forces to strengthen Kyiv's defenses. Residents of Kyiv can hear the sound of artillery fire 40 miles to the south.

TASS, Moscow, 4th: The Soviet Information Bureau issued a battle report for the night of the 3rd, stating that during the day, fighting continued in the Smolensk, Korosten, and Bila Tserkva areas, as well as on the Estonian front. There were no changes in our troop positions in other sectors. Our air force and army jointly struck enemy motorized columns, mechanized columns, infantry units, and cavalry units. On the 2nd, our air force destroyed thirteen enemy aircraft, while we lost nineteen. Two hundred German aircraft raided Moscow at night, and two were shot down. We suffered no losses. A German submarine was sunk in the Baltic Sea. According to confirmed reports, our aircraft attacked the port of Constanta on the night of the 1st, hitting an enemy destroyer and other ships.

United Press, Moscow, 4th: Soviet authorities state that the powerful German forces attempting to seize Kyiv have made some progress, but their losses since the 4th have been alarming. The areas where German forces are attacking most fiercely are reportedly the Smolensk, Korosten, and Bila Tserkva areas, followed by the Tallinn area. Korosten is 90 miles northwest of Kyiv, while Bila Tserkva is 50 miles southwest of Kyiv.

TASS, Moscow, 4th: German motorized units crossed the N River using pontoon bridges and attacked our units in the D area, but were fiercely repelled. Our troops took a defensive position, forcing the enemy to retreat to the riverbank. At the same time, soldiers of the Red Army under Adjutant Snilorev operated behind enemy lines, blowing up the pontoon bridges and cutting off the enemy's retreat. Our defending troops fired directly at the enemy with machine guns, resulting in a complete rout. Over 4,000 German soldiers were killed or drowned, 40 military vehicles were destroyed, and 120 men were captured.

### Italian Expeditionary Force Joins the Attack on the Soviet Union

Reuters, Berlin, 4th: The German official news agency reports that the Italian Expeditionary Force, which has now arrived on the southern front, will join the battlefield within days to attack Soviet forces. Elite Italian troops from northern Italy have arrived directly at the front line by train, fully equipped.

Reuters, Rome, 4th: A Romanian General Staff communiqué states that the rear of a large Soviet force fighting between the Dniester and Bug Rivers is now threatened. German and Romanian forces continue to advance between these two rivers. Motorized units there have penetrated deep into the Soviet lines, threatening a large enemy force from the rear. Efforts to encircle the enemy are currently underway.

### Only a Few German Aircraft Invade Soviet Capital

United Press, Moscow, 4th: German aircraft raided Moscow again on the night of the 2nd and morning of the 3rd. The alert was lifted after three hours. Officials stated that only a few bombers penetrated the city, with the rest being repelled by anti-aircraft fire and night fighters on the outskirts of Moscow. German aircraft dropped several incendiary bombs from high altitude, causing several fires, but they were quickly extinguished. It was discovered that although Moscow was bombed by German aircraft, the damage was minimal.

### Hopkins Returns to England from the Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 4th: U.S. President's Special Envoy Hopkins has returned here last night after visiting the Soviet Union and meeting with Stalin and Soviet government and General Staff personnel.

TASS, Moscow, 4th: Hopkins has left Moscow. Molotov, Director of the Drafting Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and Evstigneev, Director of the Foreign Relations Department of the People's Defense Committee, escorted him to the border.

### Japanese Fleet Commander Arrives in Saigon

Reuters, Tokyo, 4th: According to a Japanese newspaper report, Vice Admiral Kinoshita, commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in Vietnamese waters, arrived in Saigon yesterday from Cam Ranh Bay. In a reception for journalists, he stated that the Japanese military's entry into Vietnam is now almost complete. With the conclusion of the Japan-France joint defense agreement for Vietnam, Japan is dispatching troops to Vietnam in accordance with the agreement without delay. This is truly something to celebrate for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. He will abide by the spirit of joint defense, and he is deeply gratified that the Vietnamese government and people are sincerely cooperating with the Japanese military to facilitate their entry into Vietnam.

### Japanese Navy to Establish Defenses at Cam Ranh Bay

United Press, Tokyo, 4th: A Saigon-based correspondent for the Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported today that the Japanese Navy will establish defenses at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam as a base of operations to counter the encirclement by China, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. Japanese newspapers continue to pay close attention to rumors that China, Britain, and the United States are attempting to bring the Soviet Union into the encirclement.

Random Thoughts on the European War (7) (2)

### The Bookkeeper of the Democratic Front

The functions of the Ministry of Finance are generally unfamiliar to most people. Besides collecting customs duties and national revenue, issuing and redeeming government bonds, they also include the mint and banknote printing plant, as well as the Narcotics Suppression Bureau, which undertakes special operations, and peacetime coastal defense forces. In recent years, the powers of the Ministry of Finance have greatly expanded. It must manage the equalization fund relating to various countries, negotiate with Britain on the purchase of arms in the United States in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act, and manage frozen foreign assets. The total amount of these assets, as of the end of June this year, is over $14 billion. The recently frozen Japanese assets and the assets that China has voluntarily requested to be frozen are substantial and have not yet been included in this calculation.

Guiding such large-scale undertakings is truly a monumental task. Therefore, personnel at the Ministry of Finance have no other option but to immerse themselves in their work and adapt to changing circumstances. From the outside, the cold, marble-covered corridors of the Ministry of Finance building and the old-fashioned gilded pilasters hardly suggest the intensity of the work going on inside. But behind the row of doors with white-paneled windows lining the corridor, financial experts are racking their brains day and night, drafting tax laws, promoting national defense savings, planning new bonds, and monitoring the development of the financial market and the inflow and outflow of funds. With substantial expenditures on national defense, aid to Britain, and aid to China, the funds raised must exceed the original amount in order to cope with any contingency.

Morgenthau is accustomed to waking up early. He gets up at 6:30 every morning and spends from 7:30 reading newspapers from New York and Washington and speaking by phone with one or two staff members. One of his favorite employees walks two miles from his home to the office every morning. By 8:45 every morning, Morgenthau is already at his desk, ready to handle the day's work. At 9:30 every morning, the Ministry of Finance holds a staff meeting, attended by the Undersecretary and various Directors, from ten to twelve people.

The meeting takes place in the Secretary's office in the southwest corner of the second floor. The room is filled with an air of elegance, serenity, and solemnity, more like a private library than an office. The other rooms in this century-old building are similar.

The staff members attending the meeting sit around the Secretary, who begins by reporting some important information that everyone should know. Then, he asks each person sitting around the circle to express their opinions. The meeting is of a discussion nature, sometimes very lively, but never contentious. This is the principle prescribed by the Secretary.

As for Morgenthau himself, he frankly admits that finance is his life's work. He does not allow other things to distract his interest. In addition to working during the day, he often brings a stack of newspapers home to read after dinner.

Except for one day a week when he has lunch with the President at the White House, he usually has lunch in a small room under his office, accessible by a private elevator. In this room is an oval table where the ill-fated debt agreements were discussed and signed after the last European war. (End)

### French Tram Workers Strike Again Yesterday; All Tramcars Halted; Dispute Arises from Unequal Treatment; Authorities Exert Efforts to Mediate for Early Resumption of Work

Workers of the French Water and Electricity Company demanded an increase in allowances, and through their representatives negotiated with the political department of the French police. The company manager agreed to consider the request and respond before the 10th. Tram and other workers believed that the company was not sincere in accepting their demands, and at 3:30 p.m. yesterday, they spontaneously went on strike. All tramcars and buses were completely halted, some abandoned by the roadside. The company then managed to drive them into the Lokawei factory. Details are as follows:

Disparities in Treatment Between Chinese and Foreign Employees

Since August 1st, when the French Water and Electricity Company uniformly increased the prices of electricity, water, trams, and buses, they also accepted the employees' request to generally increase allowances, announcing a 15% increase in employee allowances. However, Chinese employees were dissatisfied because Western employees in the company received a 50% salary increase across the board, treating them differently. They firmly demanded equal treatment, but the company has not given a satisfactory response, leading to a tendency for labor to strike again. Yesterday afternoon, the political department of the French police, together with worker representatives, negotiated with the company manager. The company agreed to consider the workers' demands and respond before August 10th. However, tram and other workers were dissatisfied and announced a strike at 3:30 p.m.

Workers Strike, All Vehicles Halt

After the workers spontaneously went on strike, all trams, trolleybuses, and buses operating within the French Concession stopped or were driven into the Lokawei factory, or abandoned by the roadside. Upon learning of the workers' strike, the company immediately requested the French police to send Chinese and Western detectives to guard the Lokawei factory and the company's gate. Western employees then managed to tow the vehicles to the factory. As a result, tram routes 1, 2, 5, 7, and 10, trolleybus routes 17, 18, and 24, and bus routes 21 and 22 were completely halted after 4:00 p.m. yesterday.

Persuasion from All Sides for Immediate Resolution

A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from related parties yesterday that the political department of the French police and others have instructed worker representatives to persuade the workers to resume work as soon as possible to maintain traffic, and to wait for the company's response before August 10th. They also took responsibility for mediating the situation, as the company did not firmly reject the workers' request to increase allowances by the same 51% as foreign employees, and had agreed to consider and respond. As of last night, the workers had not yet agreed to resume work first, but it is anticipated that this strike will not escalate, and a solution may be hoped for in the short term, as the point of contention is not very serious.

English Trams Stop at the French Concession Border

The English Shanghai Tramway Company's tram route 5 and trolleybus routes 17, 18, and 24 have a mutual route plan between the International Settlement and the French Concession. Since the French Water and Electricity Company workers' strike, the above routes have stopped operating in the French Concession. Tram route 5 stops at Dongxinqiao, trolleybus routes 17 and 18 turn around at the Great World, and trolleybus route 24 stops at the intersection of Seymour Road and Avenue Foch. Since the tram and bus service in the French Concession was suspended, rickshaw drivers were making three times their usual business. Citizens felt greatly inconvenienced.

### Japanese Troops Search Nanshi, Confiscate Arms

The situation in Nanshi, which has been blockaded by iron gates, has eased slightly as of yesterday. The Japanese have opened a small path in the barbed wire next to the Xin Kai He Fire Brigade, allowing women and children to leave, but strictly prohibiting passage on Min Guo Road. It is stipulated that those wishing to go to the concessions must detour from Guanyinge Street opposite the Xin Kai He Water Works, diagonally crossing Min Guo Road, and exit through the gap in the barbed wire. However, young adults cannot leave without special certification from the Japanese. As for the Japanese troops conducting strict searches in the refugee area of Nanshi for several days, a large number of people have been arrested as suspects. It is rumored that a machine gun was seized from a house near the City God Temple the day before yesterday, along with many hand grenades and firearms. Telephones installed in residents' homes have all been disconnected since yesterday. According to other news, the search is expected to be completed tomorrow, and the iron gates may be opened, but this cannot be confirmed. Furthermore, according to someone who came out of Nanshi yesterday, after four days of blockade, food is in short supply. Rice has risen to three yuan per liter, and there is nowhere to buy it. Each pancake costs four corners. Vegetables cannot be purchased due to the disruption of supplies. Pork is still available, but it costs six yuan per catty, causing residents of Nanshi to cry out in distress.

### Proper Merchants Apply for Foreign Exchange, Procedure Extremely Strict; Must Be Creditworthy and Detail Purpose; Foreign Exchange Checks Only Paid After Review; British Government Authorizes HSBC and Three Other Banks to Handle Applications

Since the United States announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds on the 25th of last month, the US Treasury Department has issued two types of notes: one authorizing Hawaii and the Philippines to maintain normal trade relations with China and Japan, and one authorizing fourteen foreign banks in Shanghai to provide foreign exchange to maintain normal trade between China and the United States, South America, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies. The procedures stipulated in General Notes 58 and 59 could be followed. Britain, on the other hand, simply ordered all branches in China or outside China to seal all pound sterling deposits, bonds, and cash, regardless of nationality, to prevent them from being transferred. Although it was stated that import and export trade between China and the sterling bloc would still be maintained, no detailed procedures were specified. British banks then sent telegrams to London for instructions. According to reports from the Great China News Agency, the response has arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The British government has authorized HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, three British banks, to handle applications and provide foreign exchange. The following are the details of the information obtained yesterday:

Application Regulations Very Thorough

Regarding the procedures for applying for foreign exchange, the main points of the US regulations are: (1) must be bona fide import and export trade; (2) the applicant must be a Chinese or foreign person engaged in import and export trade in China before March 14th of this year; (3) the foreign exchange applied for should be equal to the value of the import and export trade. Currently, all foreign banks are handling applications for US dollars in accordance with the above principles. As for the procedures for applying for pounds sterling, the response arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The text of the telegram has not been made public. According to sources from senior HSBC bank officials, the British government has authorized HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, three British banks, to provide foreign exchange to merchants who have accounts with the above three banks and whose creditworthiness has been deemed reliable by the managers of the three banks. The application must specify in detail to which place and bank the funds are to be paid, what goods are to be purchased, and the amount required, and be submitted to the three banks for review. The foreign exchange check is then paid after approval by the managers of the three banks, allowing them to use the funds. The procedure is very careful and strict.

British Nationals Allowed to Withdraw Living Expenses

In addition, the British government's announced freeze order, ordering all branches in China or outside China to seal all pound sterling deposits, bonds, and cash, regardless of nationality, has resulted in British nationals' funds being frozen as well, making it impossible for them to withdraw funds for even the most basic living expenses and other legitimate uses. At the request of British nationals, the banks have also telegraphed London for instructions on how to improve the situation. In yesterday's response, the British government has reportedly provided instructions on how to improve the situation. The reporter has not yet been able to confirm this, but it is known that HSBC, in view of the plight of those who rely on deposits for their livelihood, has made changes to the policy of not allowing any withdrawals after careful consideration. It has allowed British depositors to withdraw small amounts of three or five pounds for temporary living expenses. It is difficult to approve amounts exceeding these.

Exports from Shanghai Inevitably Reduced

Since the implementation of the freeze order, British and American banks have been unable to freely provide foreign exchange, which has inevitably had a significant impact on Shanghai's foreign trade. A senior official of a British bank told the reporter about a noticeable natural phenomenon, believing that Britain and the United States will inevitably reduce exports to Shanghai. It is said that at present, all foreign banks in Shanghai have refused to undertake exchange pledges. For example, if a merchant intends to export goods worth 10,000 yuan to a foreign country, in the past, they only needed to pay the bank one-third of the value of the goods in foreign exchange to be able to load the goods onto the ship for export. Later, the exchange pledge increased to one-half, but now it has increased to one hundred percent, that is, for goods worth 10,000 yuan, they must first pay 10,000 yuan in foreign exchange. The purpose of this move is clearly to prevent the goods from being interrupted en route, on the way, or other impacts due to changes in the situation.

### Smallpox Discovered in Japanese-Administered Hongkou

Since the beginning of summer in Shanghai, the weather has been abnormal. Although the recent heatwave has returned to normal, the late July rains were continuous and cool, resembling autumn. Because the climate has been suddenly cold and hot, and suddenly sunny and rainy, epidemics are rampant. It is reported that smallpox was discovered in Yangshupu the day before yesterday. The patient, Kim Jeong-gil, a 30-year-old Korean, lived at 226 MacTaggart Road, Yuanfang Road, Yangshupu. After diagnosis by a doctor, it was determined that he had smallpox, and he was sent to the Tungren Society Baziqiao Hospital for treatment. The Japanese military then sealed off the surrounding area, cut off traffic, carried out large-scale disinfection, and temporarily vaccinated approximately 200 Chinese and Japanese residents in the area for prevention.

### Overseas British Nationals in China Raise Funds to Purchase Aircraft

British nationals in China recently raised a large sum of money and presented it to the government to purchase a squadron of aircraft to be incorporated into the British Air Force, named the "China British Squadron". The British nationals have set a goal to raise £200,000 sterling by August 15th to continue purchasing a second "China British Squadron" to strengthen the British Air Force's power.

### French Concession Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee Meets to Review Rice Market; Resolves to Maintain Original Prices of Foreign Rice

The French Concession Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee is deeply concerned about the overall food situation in Shanghai. In view of the current rise in rice prices, which is purely due to malicious rumors and manipulation by speculative rice merchants, the Committee could not bear to stand idly by. On the 28th of last month, it invited responsible representatives from the rice, coal, beef and mutton, Chinese and foreign groceries, soy sauce, and fresh meat industries to discuss stabilizing the food supply and suppressing the prices of various goods. After discussion, the Committee determined the standard sales prices of four types of foreign rice on the spot and ordered all rice shops in the city to comply. In order to review whether the rice prices that have been evaluated are suitable for the standard, the Committee convened responsible representatives from the above industries again at 3:30 p.m. yesterday to discuss continuing to suppress rice prices. More than ten representatives from the rice, coal, and Chinese and foreign groceries industries attended. Zhu Yigui, Chinese Secretary of the French Municipal Council, also attended. The meeting was still chaired by Vina. As a result of the discussion, the evaluated four types of foreign rice will remain at the original prices, namely: (1) No. 1 Saigon (160 city catties per stone) 116 yuan, (2) No. 2 Saigon 119 yuan, (3) Fair Price Small Broken Rice 116 yuan, (4) No. 1 and 2 Saigon Mixed Broken Rice 89 yuan.

### England and America Should Adopt Stern Measures to Keep Thailand Neutral and Provide Protection and Economic Assistance to Save Thailand; the Opportunity is Fleeting

An editorial by Mr. Woodhead was published in the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" yesterday, extensively discussing the threat to Thailand from Japan. It stated that to save Thailand from suffering the same fate as French Indochina, all democratic nations must immediately take stern measures that are coordinated with each other to be effective. It is rumored that Japan is currently making excessive demands on Thailand, effectively monopolizing its trade and paving the way for using Thai territory as a military base for land and air forces.

Emergency Control of Huge Loans

It is reported that Japan's first action in this direction was to obtain a line of credit from a Thai banking group for 10 million Thai baht, equivalent to 16 million Japanese yen. For a small country to lend such a large amount to another country is remarkable. If democratic nations implement the recently announced economic retaliation to the greatest extent possible, the lending country risks economic ruin. Japan's move must be seen as the first step in economically and politically controlling Thailand.

Continuing Land Cessions to Thailand

According to recent telegrams, Japan's subsequent actions will involve ceding Vietnamese territory to Thailand, including the famous Angkor temple site, to induce the Thai government to sign an agreement allowing Japan to establish land and air bases in Thailand. This obviously contradicts the guarantees made by the Japanese government when signing the Thai-Vietnamese border agreement and the promises made to Vichy (and the British ambassador) last week. Japan guaranteed on March 11, when the Thai-Vietnamese border agreement was signed, that the terms of the agreement were "inviolable" and assured Vichy that Japan would strictly fulfill its obligation to respect Vietnam's territorial and sovereign integrity. However, Angkor was not part of the territory ceded during the negotiations in March.

Must Give the Dutch East Indies Real Guarantees

There are several ways that democratic nations can prevent Japan from invading Thailand. First, they must increase direct pressure on Japan, declaring that unless Japan abandons any intention of political or economic aggression against Thailand, economic retaliation will be inflexible. In this regard, to facilitate sincere cooperation from the Dutch East Indies, Britain and America must give the Dutch East Indies a real guarantee that they will not doubt that if Japan threatens or even attacks the Dutch East Indies due to a complete embargo against Japan or Japanese-controlled areas, Britain and America will take countermeasures. Britain and America should not make the Dutch East Indies the vanguard of retaliation against Japan without guaranteeing their protection.

Britain and America Have Always Been Very Friendly to Thailand

Furthermore, Britain and America must formulate a clear policy towards Thailand itself. The British government's relationship with Thailand has always been quite friendly, based on mutual trust. No well-informed Thai person suspects that Britain and America harbor any aggressive intentions towards Thailand. The British military preparations near the Thai border were notified to the Thai government with explanations. A Thai military delegation from Bangkok was recently welcomed by the British and visited defense areas. Newspapers in Bangkok recently compared the measures taken by the British in Malaya and Burma with the actions of the Japanese in Vietnam, praising the British.

Britain Permits Oil Exports to Thailand

Two months ago, Britain permitted the import of petroleum products from British territories to Thailand on a pro-rata basis. This demonstrates Britain's concern for Thailand's welfare. Thailand cannot obtain oil supplies without British-Dutch cooperation. Britain and America should immediately declare that if the Thai government makes concessions that harm British and American interests, no oil will be available. Japan is in no position to supply oil to Thailand. In fact, a British-American-Dutch oil embargo, if truly effective, would require the Japanese land, sea, and air forces in Vietnam to transport gasoline and petroleum products from Japan, depleting Japan's reserves.

Hoping for Strict Neutrality

It must also be clarified that if Thailand becomes a base for further Japanese aggression, the freeze on Japanese funds imposed by Britain, America, and the Netherlands will be applied to Thailand with the same severity. However, the actions of Britain and America should not rely solely on threats. They should also guarantee that if Thailand adheres to a strict policy of neutrality, it will receive economic and financial assistance and protection. Britain and America do not want Thailand to have disputes with Japan; what they hope for from Thailand is neutrality, not active cooperation. If Thailand refuses to make concessions to avoid being used to attack British, Dutch, or American territories in the Far East, Britain and America should guarantee its territorial integrity and economic autonomy without hesitation. The opportunity to save Thailand from becoming a victim of the so-called "Greater East Asia New Order" must not be lost.

### Staff of Southern Goods Store Attempts to Harm Mother-in-Law but Fails; Encounters a Female Server, Marries Last Autumn and Cohabitates; the Woman's Mother Repeatedly Makes Demands, Leading to Enmity

Wang Linbao, from Ningbo, is 19 years old. He lost his parents at a young age and recently worked as a clerk at the Sanyang Southern Goods Store at 630 Nanjing Road. Last November, he went to the rooftop garden of Wing On Company, where he met Wu Ailian (also known as A Yuan), a 17-year-old female server in the cinema department from Nanjing. He fell in love at first sight. Learning that she was unmarried, Wang went to her home at 19 Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession to court her. They fell in love, and he discussed marriage with her mother, Wu Qiang.

Talking About the Bride Price

of 3,600 yuan, as she had no son, it was as good as recruiting Wang as a son-in-law. Wang Linbao's parents were deceased, but he had an aunt, Ms. Song, who lived on North Shansi Road and owned the Dafeng Southern Goods Store, possessing considerable wealth. Wang told her about his intention to marry A Yuan and sought her support. However, Aunt Song had arranged a marriage for him with a woman from their hometown, but Wang had divorced her because he found her unsophisticated. Therefore, she ignored his request. Wang Linbao, infatuated with A Yuan, made vows of eternal love with her.

Engaged to Be Lifelong Partners

He gradually handed over the bride price of 3,600 yuan to her mother, Wu Zhang, who accepted it. In March of this year, he and the woman inspected a house at 185 Mike Tor Road and moved from the French Concession to live there as husband and wife. They planned to get married before the Mid-Autumn Festival. However, Wu Zhang demanded an additional 1,100 yuan for the wedding ceremony, which Wang Linbao refused, leading to a dispute. Wang suddenly had a malicious thought to kill her. He recently purchased

Poisonous Mercury

in a package from the Zhu Bonian Medicinal Materials Store on Fujian Road and hid it inside a cardboard box of Rendan pills, waiting for an opportunity to act. On the morning of the 3rd of this month, at 8:30 AM, Wang bought a large bowl of oily tofu vermicelli from a street vendor and brought it back. He divided it into three glasses and secretly added the mercury to one of them, giving it to A Yuan to feed to her mother, Wu Zhang, to harm her life. She felt severe abdominal pain after drinking it and hired a vehicle to Renji Hospital for treatment. She learned that the oily tofu vermicelli contained poison, which Wang Linbao had added due to past grudges. Fortunately, the toxicity was mild. After some time, the pain subsided, and she returned home clear-headed. She reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station, which sent detective Chen Boqin to the Sanyang Southern Goods Store

to Arrest Wang

He was taken to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution for attempted murder, requesting an investigation. Wu Zhang testified about the incident, and detective Chen presented the Rendan box, glass, and the remaining poisonous mercury. Questioned, the defendant confessed that he had put mercury in two glasses, one for Wu Zhang and one for himself, intending to commit suicide together. The rest of his confession was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzhi ordered him to be detained and rescheduled the hearing.

### Former Chinese General Manager of Swire, Yang Meinan, Passes Away

Mr. Yang Meinan, former Chinese General Manager of the British Swire Shipping Company, passed away at his Shanghai residence at 7:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 3rd). The funeral is scheduled for 10:00 AM today at the International Funeral Parlor. Mr. Yang was a native of Zhongshan, Guangdong, and was 71 years old. He worked for Swire for more than 40 years and retired last June, just one year and two months ago. Yang was kind and amiable, and all his colleagues, both Chinese and foreign, respected him. He had three sons, all of whom work in well-known commercial institutions. He recently suffered from stomach illness and passed away the day before yesterday. The company flew its flag at half-mast yesterday in mourning for Mr. Yang.

### Approaching the Fourth Anniversary of the Shanghai War; All Sectors Prepare for Commemoration; Step up Donation Drives for Disaster Relief; Concessions Decide to Implement Joint Alert

The fourth anniversary of the Shanghai War is approaching. Given the special environment of Shanghai, people from all walks of life in the city have decided not to hold extravagant commemorative ceremonies for this great and sacred anniversary. However, to express their firm belief in resistance and to mourn the martyrs and compatriots who died in the war, various groups have jointly decided to suspend all entertainment activities and observe a vegetarian diet for one day. At noon on that day, everyone will stand up in their respective places and silently mourn. At the same time, they will step up the donation drive for disaster relief, using resolute action as a solemn commemoration.

Joint Alert by Concession Authorities

In view of the approaching anniversary of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council have decided to implement a joint alert to maintain security within the concessions and prevent any disturbances. The various measures and methods have been jointly agreed upon by the two authorities. In addition to deploying the defense forces and merchant corps to assist in the alert, they have also decided that from the 9th onwards, no organization within the concessions may hold meetings, form associations, march, or demonstrate. Police officers will be stationed in all public places to closely monitor and strictly enforce curfew laws. Traffic on roads, lanes, and bridges will be subject to security measures as needed.

### Photography Industry Employees Suddenly Go on Strike Yesterday; Workers Try to Persuade Others to Join, Leading to Conflicts; One Employee Injured; One Person Arrested

There are a total of 150 to 160 photography studios of various sizes and artistic levels in Shanghai, employing more than 1,200 workers. Wages range from 30 to 50 yuan to over 200 yuan per month, also varying widely. Recently, all employees organized a trade union and

Made Demands

to the studios, requesting a wage increase of 20% to 90%, a monthly rice subsidy of three dou per person, 20% of the annual profit as a bonus, and the implementation of an eight-hour workday, among 15 other conditions. The photography studios had previously had no contact with each other. Therefore, all the studio owners organized the Shanghai Photographic Trade Association. After its establishment, they elected representatives to negotiate with the labor representatives. The two sides met twice, and the results were satisfactory. They scheduled

Another Discussion

for the 7th. However, the employees believed that the employers lacked sincerity and suddenly went on strike yesterday morning. Some employees had not yet joined the union. Striking workers went to persuade them to stop working and join the strike. When the striking workers went to the Baille Photography Studio at 614 Avenue Joffre, the employees of the studio did not understand their intentions and refused to stop working, leading to a conflict. As a result, some of the studio's equipment was slightly damaged, and one employee was injured in the head. The incident was reported to the French Concession Police, who dispatched a large number of detectives

to Suppress the Scene

One hat-wearing worker was arrested on the spot. At the same time, the Guangyi Photography Studio at 538 Jing'an Temple Road was also vandalized by striking workers, who destroyed camera boxes and other equipment, causing significant losses. The political departments of the International Settlement and the French Concession have sent personnel to investigate separately to convene both parties for mediation.

### Finance; Importers Settle US Dollar Advances

In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed rates for various currencies did not change. The black market rate for British currency was slightly soft. Gold prices returned to level after being soft. After the morning opening, British and American commercial banks were willing to supply. French-owned Banque de l'Indochine also released some funds. However, importers only managed to settle half of their 50,000-yuan demand at a rate of 5.25 yuan per US dollar. Due to continued difficulties in securing Russian currency, the market tended to level off. However, the rate for British gold hardened to 31/25, at which it could be settled. In the afternoon, speculators engaged in new transactions for the September term. British and American commercial banks supplied, and the market saw little change. The closing prices were higher than the previous Saturday for British currency and level for US dollars. Trading activity was not brisk.

British and French Commercial Banks Provided Supply

Since morning, the London and New York metal markets showed no activity, and the price of Indian silver remained unchanged. International exchange rates saw British currency against Shanghai rise by 0.03125, while other rates remained level. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. At the opening of the domestic market, banks offered spot British currency at 31/32.09375, Indian currency rose by 0.015625, and US dollars remained level at 5.2875 yuan. Upon hearing this, British and French commercial banks supplied, and the market immediately hardened. HSBC's listed rates remained level. The silver equalization tax remained slightly at 24.25%. At HSBC's small counter, the US dollar rate remained at 5.1875 yuan. Later, importers came to secure US dollars for the August term at 5.25 yuan. Benefiting and some American banks supplied 25,000 yuan, which Banque de l'Indochine sold at the same price. Since foreign banks absorbed the supply, it softened again and became difficult to settle. However, after Chinese banks conducted mutual transactions for August British gold at 21/25, it stabilized. The afternoon closing prices were 31/32.125 for British currency and 5.12875 yuan for US dollars.

New Prices for September British Gold Also Appear

The market was extremely level in the afternoon. Chinese speculators opened new transactions for the September term, securing it at 5.25 yuan, supplied by foreign commercial banks. The amount was not large. At 3:30 PM, the closing prices for spot and August term were both 31/32.109375 for British currency and 5.12875 yuan for US dollars, 0.01565 higher for British currency and level for US dollars compared to the noon closing on the previous Saturday. New prices for the September term were also released (according to Reuters), with British gold at 31/32.109375 and US dollars at 5.2875 yuan, the same as the spot price.

Quiet Trading in Tianjin-Shanghai Exchange

The Hong Kong exchange market was closed yesterday, and no telegrams were received. The Tianjin exchange market has also been inactive for several days. It was heard yesterday that exchanging 100 yuan of 法幣in Shanghai to Tianjin could fetch 50 yuan of "聯鈔," but this was only on the black market. Since trading was very quiet, some have stopped these transactions.

### Gold and Silver Spot Prices Reach Unprecedented Highs

Yesterday's gold prices on the black market continued to decline, with prices falling below the 6,700-yuan mark. Everyone was exhausted and speculated that US-Japanese relations were about to break down. The US dollar was at 5.25 yuan, and British and American commercial banks were willing to sell. HSBC and securities firms rushed to sell, and the price fell from an opening of 6,705 yuan to a low of 6,670 yuan. Unexpectedly, purchases by importers to settle 50,000 US dollars brought the price back to around 6,690 yuan. In the afternoon, the fluctuations were even narrower, only 9 yuan high or low. The final result was a small 16-yuan gain. After the market closed, there were rumors of a US-Japanese compromise, and the price immediately rose to 6,704 yuan. Total trading volume exceeded 20,000 taels. Cash prices rose again and reached unprecedented highs. In the morning, Yida and Wanfeng each acquired 10 taels of 懂記金, priced at 8,250 yuan. Xianghe first acquired 80 taels of 恒記金, Minghua 50 taels, and Russian currency reappeared in the form of 50 taels of Chengji gold, all priced at 8,260 yuan. Xianghe then sold 80 taels of 德孚金for 8,280 yuan. Chengji sold 60 taels of 德成金for 8,250 yuan. Shunyuan sold 20 taels of 恒記金for 8,290 yuan. In the afternoon, Minghua sold 40 taels and Hesheng sold 10 taels, all purchased by 德孚 for 8,300 yuan. Later, demand exceeded supply, pushing the price to an unprecedented high of 8,360 yuan, and there were few sellers. The price rose by 100 yuan. Jewelry gold also rose by 10 yuan, reaching 855 yuan.

Futures Prices Fall Below 7,000 Yuan

The opening price for each tael (10 taels) was 6,705 yuan at 9:15 AM, 2 yuan lower than the noon closing price on the previous Saturday. It was rumored that foreign exchange rates were softening, and US dollars could be settled at 5.25 yuan. Xinfengyong, Dingsheng, Yida, and Xinyuan rushed to sell, and retail investors also sold. The market price fell, dropping below 6,700 yuan. The decline accelerated, dropping by 35 yuan. At 9:45 AM, it fell to 6,670 yuan, which was aggressively bought by 天元 and 熾大, who covered their short positions and raised the price to around 6,680 yuan. Xinfengyong came back to buy, pushing the price up to 6,692 yuan. The market was flat at noon, with little fluctuation, and had fallen to a low of 6,685 yuan. The noon closing price was 6,688 yuan. The market opened 5 yuan lower at 2:00 PM, at 6,683 yuan. Wanfeng, Yida, etc., came to buy, gradually raising the price to 6,692 yuan. 德成 sold, causing a slight pullback to 6,688 yuan. 義元 bought, and the 3:30 PM closing price was 6,691 yuan, 16 yuan lower than the noon closing price on the previous Saturday.

The selling price of gold from 金號's own brands was 8,400 yuan, and the buying price was 8,200 yuan. The spot premium had no price and no market.

Jewelry Gold and Refined Silver Both Rise

The selling price of jewelry and ornaments余 per tael was initially quoted at 845 yuan, rising 5 yuan at noon and rising another 5 yuan at 3:30 PM, reaching 855 yuan (buying price reduced by 40 yuan), a total increase of 10 yuan.

### Grain: Java Rice Arrives Again, Rice Prices Drop Further

Another shipment of Java foreign rice has arrived. The Zhibaide postal ship of Java Company arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 2nd) at noon, carrying about 11,000 bags, totaling 1,100 tons, of foreign rice loaded from Java, as well as over 500 bags of corn. It docked at the Puxi Lanyancong Wharf for unloading. (Zu)

Yesterday, the arrival of foreign rice led to sluggish sales and a weak market sentiment. This was because inventories were steadily increasing, the source of supply was continuous, transshipment had no outlet, the local market had a supply of affordable Hong Kong rice, and exchange rate contraction further dampened market confidence. In the late trading session, both current and forward rice prices declined across the board. Despite it being a week when local merchants usually replenish their stocks, purchases remained sluggish. Consequently, opening prices already showed a downward trend. The Yinghua Company saw no improvement, with Xiaojiao Road goods at only 148.2 yuan, and second-grade Siamese rice at only 144 yuan. Broken rice was at 104.5 yuan, all down by two or three yuan from the previous Saturday. There were also no large-scale transactions. The total market paper showed over 500 tons, and current rice prices were dragged down by one or two yuan. Transactions amounted to over 10,000 bags. At closing, first-grade Qu Gong rose from 133.5 yuan to 133 yuan, and then fell to 128 yuan; second-grade was at 122.5 yuan, then 123 yuan; first-grade Siamese rice was at 127 yuan, and second-grade at 120.5 yuan, then falling to 118 yuan; Min Dang rose from 131 yuan and fell to 125 yuan; Jia Fo rice was at 128.5 yuan, then 128 yuan; Xiaojiao Bank Warehouse was from 122.5 yuan to 121 yuan; outside warehouses were from 121 yuan to 120 yuan, then falling to 119 yuan; Tokyo Superior Special was at 117.5 yuan, then 116 yuan; rice tea was at 11 yuan, and broken special rice was from 95.5 yuan, falling to 89 yuan.

Yesterday, thick and thin japonica rice rebounded with increased arrivals, leading to a return to weak market sentiment. This was because it was during the summer season, making goods susceptible to spoilage and unable to withstand prolonged storage, which loosened the sellers' intentions. Nowadays, general merchants are also wary of overstocking for the same reason, and sales are sluggish. As a result, in a market with more outgoing than incoming goods, thick and thin japonica rice traders found it difficult to maintain prices. Due to the soft texture and increased supply of early and late rice from Nangang, prices were lowered by more than two yuan, opening at 153 yuan to 151 yuan. Wuxi original packaged white japonica rice only dropped by one yuan, opening at 146 yuan to 142 yuan.

Glutinous rice, with its seasonal decline, had a continuously weakening outlet. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened high at 125.5 yuan, then fell to 122 yuan; glutinous mung beans were at 115 yuan to 112.5 yuan; and Guo Yuan was at 127 yuan, showing a softening of nearly one yuan.

### Flour Rebounds

Flour prices tended to soften because customer demand was not strong. Yesterday, there were more transactions of the Jinlong flour, initially opening at 32.15 yuan, then falling to 32.05 yuan, and further to 31.95 yuan, 31.85 yuan, 31.75 yuan, and 31.65 yuan. Paotai flour was at 33.05 yuan. Lianlou and Huawu flour, such as those stored in bank warehouses, were priced around 34.23 yuan, while Taigu and Roosevelt warehouse goods were below 34 yuan. None of these transactions were completed, indicating a possible continuation of market softening.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Red Beans Reach Peak – Breakthrough at 90 Yuan –

The arrival of yellow beans has been scarce recently, and the declared reserves have gradually decreased. Coupled with the repeated surge in oil prices, market sentiment is unanimously optimistic. Yesterday, Shantou and Xiamen traders, as well as local stockpilers, purchased 600 bags of Tianjin Jin Yuan, nearly 1,000 bags of Guide yellow beans, 500 bags of Qingkou yellow beans, and 300 bags of Jiaozhou yellow beans. Prices uniformly rose by two yuan. (See the market price section for detailed market conditions.)

Red bean arrivals were scarce and inventories were depleted, coinciding with the peak sales season. Consequently, market prices steadily increased. Yesterday, Guangdong traders purchased 50 bags of Tianjin red beans at a record high of 90 yuan, a significant jump of ten yuan compared to the previous level.

On the 5th, 495 bags of beans were exported to Hong Kong, and 2,240 bean cakes were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Northern and Southern Goods: Orchid Bamboo Branches Hold Firm

Two batches of new orchid bamboo branch goods arrived, totaling dozens of boxes. Due to the limited overall quantity, the market held steady, maintaining the original price of 340 yuan. Sixty or so boxes of old goods arrived, and the traders offered 30-40 yuan more. They have already telegraphed the owners to inquire, but no agreement has been reached yet.

### Yarn and Cotton: Shenxin Factory Issues Price List, Double Horse Attempts to Advance but is Thwarted, Futures Yarn Sees Stronger Gains in Distant Months

The yarn market is still in a state of fluctuation, but market sentiment varies. Many believe that the goods purchased by Hong Kong traders have already been shipped out without issues. On the one hand, Hong Kong traders continue to actively trade in current yarn. It is reported that 2,600 bales of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today. In addition, American cotton rebounded after a fall, leading to optimistic market sentiment. On the other hand, although sellers are trading in current yarn, the inland transportation lines are extremely difficult, which is predicted to prevent large-scale transactions from developing. Furthermore, factories show interest in selling, thus leaning towards selling off rather than continuous shortages, demonstrating the fierce contention between bulls and bears. In this regard, a tug-of-war between 550 yuan and 600 yuan is possible. The high price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,577 yuan, and the low price was 1,554 yuan. In the early afternoon, it started at 1,560 yuan, then rose to 1,569 yuan, with the final price at 1,566-67 yuan. Shenxin Factory issued a factory price list for 20-count Double Horse at a current advance price of 1,540 yuan, totaling 1,500 bales.

Double Horse opened in the morning with good sentiment due to the surge in American cotton. The initial tight price was 1,570 yuan, and it soon rose to 1,576 yuan. Subsequently, reports indicated that transactions with Guangdong traders were not very robust. At the same time, the Shenxin factory announced a large-scale offering, causing market sentiment to soften and short sellers to become active, pushing prices down to 1,554 yuan. However, the exchange market remained firm, and some traders returned to buy in several bales, causing the market to rebound to 1,563 yuan at closing. The statistical volume of transactions for the afternoon was 7,365 bales. The amounts purchased by various trading groups are listed as follows: Fellow Traders 7,000, Hong Kong 365, Total 7,365.

The Jin Xie Ma futures yarn market situation: The initial opening in the morning saw heightened volatility due to American cotton fluctuations. Gold firms and securities firms bought in near-term positions, with August rising by 5 yuan and September rising by 1 yuan. October, however, saw a sudden drop of 5 yuan as bulls were still emerging. Subsequently, due to the lack of any specific changes in foreign exchange and gold prices, and a lack of development in Hong Kong sales, many near-term bulls concluded their positions, with some shifting to distant positions. Market prices were soft in the near term but rebounded in the distant term. The afternoon closing saw August rise by 1 yuan, September rise by 1.5 yuan, and October rise by 0.5 yuan, with a total of 5,350 bales traded. The initial market opening indicated weakness in the near term but strength in the distant term. Later, due to rumors of a certain party taking over the court, new buyers and short covering drove prices up, with August reaching a high of 1,455 yuan, September reaching 1,530 yuan, and October reaching 1,519 yuan, before slightly retreating. The evening closing results showed August up by 8 yuan compared to last Saturday, September up by 19 yuan, and October up by 23 yuan. A total of 12,130 bales were traded today, an increase of 7,580 bales compared to the previous day. The full-day opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded as follows (these are net closing prices):

Market Announcement: Market conditions have gradually stabilized in recent days. The special security deposit of 50 yuan per bale for new buying and selling transactions, which was separately levied from July 31st, has been cancelled from the 4th of this month.

### Cotton Prices Led by American Cotton

The current cotton situation has turned upward due to the unabated rise in American cotton prices, which has led to a firm market sentiment. However, demand from current cotton manufacturers has not shown significant development. Nevertheless, sentiment among recyclers has turned firm again. Rangoon Cotton 272 bales, Sulun 22 bales were sent to factories, and also 268 bales from No. 101 were delivered to the warehouse, and also High Grade 267 No. 5 and also 200 bales, and also 278 and also 100 bales, and also Brazilian Cotton 49 and also 129 bales, and also High Grade 505 and also 116 bales, and also Subgrade 490 and also 30 bales, and also Pengjiapo 381.5 and also 100 bales, and also Huishideng 381.5 and also 100 bales, and also Xingheng Cotton 280 and also 100 bales, and also.

### Oil and Wax: 800 Tons of Foreign Wax Arrive

Foreign wax, i.e., kerosene, has been in short supply for a long time, leading to a firm market rebound. Yesterday, 800 tons arrived from Java, which is expected to alleviate the tension temporarily.

### Securities: Public Bonds Rebound – Xiangtai Lumber Stock Soars –

The over-the-counter market for public bonds continued to rise yesterday, even more sharply than before. Roughly one or two firms covered their short positions, while two or three others saw an opportunity and bought in, pushing up market prices. Class C bonds were surprisingly bid up to seven yuan, due to short covering. There was no substantial reason for the continued rise, and the hidden uncertainties still remain. Yesterday morning, Shengda Public, Chengdechang bought in, while Jiufeng, Runde, Lianhe, and Lianyi sold off. The afternoon closing price improved by four to five jiao. In the afternoon, Xiexing and Yuantong bought in, while Hongda and Yichang took the opportunity to absorb them. Lianyi covered its positions, while Jiufeng, Runde, and Lianhe continued to cut losses. Shengda resold, and Yitai took the opportunity to dispose of its holdings. Class C bonds were bid up to seven yuan, with demand exceeding supply. As a result, prices uniformly continued to rise by five jiao to as much as nine and a half jiao. The transaction volume was around 2.5 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

In stock trading, 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 14 yuan.

The public stock market opened modestly, and prices remained stable throughout the day. Xiangtai Lumber stock experienced another surge, soaring from 83.5 yuan to close at 91.5 yuan. The transaction volume was substantial. Gangye shares also rose from 32 yuan to 34.5 yuan. Rubber shares were quiet but also showed an upward trend.

### Sugar Market: Java Sugar Arrives

The sugar market saw a downward trend yesterday because the source of supply can be continuously loaded. 1,500 tons of Java sugar arrived yesterday, which caused a weak market sentiment and a relatively sharp decline in prices. In company futures trading, the initial price for August 10th was 103.2 jiao, which later fell to 100.75 jiao, a decrease of 2.5 jiao. The August 20th price was 103 yuan, 2.5 jiao, a decrease of 2.2 jiao. The association's planned spot price for 24 coarse white sugar arriving in July was 103.2 jiao to 101 yuan, a decrease of 2.7 jiao; for June, it was 102.3 jiao to 101 yuan, a decrease of 2.5 jiao; for May, it was 102 yuan to 100.5 jiao, a decrease of 2 jiao; for April, it was 101.5 yuan to 100 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Sales of Hong Kong Cloth Flourish, Market Sentiment is Enthusiastic, Eastern Cloth also Rises Sharply

Factory cloth: Yesterday's market trend was firm, and market sentiment was enthusiastic. This was because demand from Guangdong was increasing, and local merchants' interest in trading was also strong. Cloth prices rose across the board. White cotton cloth and twill rose by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan per piece, coarse cloth rose by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 1 yuan. Over 600 pieces of various cloths were traded in the lumber district. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders purchased over 400 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, twill, and coarse cloth. Tianjin traders from the north purchased over 100 pieces of flannel, coarse cloth, and broadcloth. Overseas Nanyang traders purchased 5-6,000 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth. On the 3rd, 910 pieces of piece goods were exported to Hong Kong, and on the 5th, another 1,950 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 685 pieces were shipped to Calcutta.

Eastern cloth: Yesterday, due to active spot sales, market prices continued to rise. Futures for various months of fine cloth on the exchange rose sharply, by 1.1 to 1.44 yuan per piece. The closing price for spot Lung Tou fine cloth was 52.6 yuan, up 0.8 yuan. Colored cloth "Four Gentlemen" serge, new batch with new taxes, was scarce, with the closing selling price opening at 1.725 yuan, a sharp increase of about 0.05 yuan per yard. New batch with old taxes was at 1.7015 yuan, and old batch with old taxes was at 1.665 yuan, also up about 0.03 yuan per yard.

### Linings and Interlinings Rise Steadily

Items such as linings and interlinings, like mercerized feather yarn, horsehair sleeve linings, printed foreign cloth, French interlining, black and gray interlining, and soft interlining, have recently risen again. This is due to the scarcity and high cost of raw materials, high factory overheads, increased costs, and fewer weavers than before. Buyers are eagerly inquiring about them. Yesterday, Datong wax thread mercerized feather yarn was wholesaled at 2.8 yuan per yard, Chen Heqing wax yarn was at 2.23 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were priced at one yuan. Ordinary silk-woven horsehair sleeve linings were sold at 3.8-3.9 yuan, and yarn-woven ones were at 3.25 yuan.

### Coal: Tongdeli Coal is Being Hoarded – Market Conditions are Chaotic –

The market conditions for Tongdeli white coal have been extremely chaotic recently. This is entirely due to traders hoarding their supplies, leading to a shortage of spot goods and creating a red-hot situation. Although Bingxing is still quoting the old price of 438 yuan, it is a market with prices but no goods, making it futile. A certain company opened at 455 yuan, plus 17 yuan for old orders. Therefore, prices in local shops also vary greatly. Screened lumps delivered to customers require 472 yuan per ton.

### Medicinal Materials: Honeysuckle Sells Rapidly

Honeysuckle has been scarce recently, with depleted inventories. The cost of bringing goods here is very high, leading to a sudden tightening of the market. Yesterday, dozens of packages opened at 580 yuan for high-quality goods, with slightly lower prices for lesser quality, a significant increase of about 100 yuan compared to before.

### The Value of Life

— Xiao Yun

Because literary and artistic works, dramas, and movies can be divided into morbid and healthy, anesthetizing and sobering, poisonous and non-toxic, we should, in the future, evaluate literary and artistic works, dramas, or movies, not only by their artistic value but also by their life value. No, we should, under the principle of not neglecting artistic value, place life value above artistic value. We put life value first because we have life before we have art.

In this way, we have a standard to follow for the selection of reading materials.

Reading materials that immerse young people in a dreamy, nihilistic, idealistic, or passive state are undoubtedly poisonous. What they instill in young people is a kind of escapist, degenerate, status quo-maintaining, distorted, and low-taste thinking, causing them to lose the courage to live and dare not face reality.

Beneficial progressive reading materials, although not all about praising the bright side, also include a lot of descriptions and exposures of ugliness, but in the words, beyond the words, an intense hatred is expressed imperceptibly, so that the requesters can understand its intention, and their minds suddenly open up. In the real world, they can fight more actively and follow the right path according to the hints in the book.

Of course, this kind of spiritual poison or tonic can only be distinguished and chosen by the method of experience. It is not right to put the responsibility of distinguishing toxic or hygienic reading materials on young people. This responsibility should be shouldered by literary writers and book critics to make double efforts.

Invention

### Substitutes in the Voice of National Defense

— Xin Liang

In order to enable the national defense industry to obtain sufficient materials, the United States is now also working hard to conserve various metals, rubber, silk, cork, and certain types of wood. However, general consumers do not need to panic, because the government and private institutions are simultaneously doing their best to invent substitutes.

A so-called "plastics" industry has now developed almost very successfully. Metal parts that used to have to be made entirely or partially of lead, magnesium, tin, chromium, and zinc have now been almost completely replaced by this "clay." Whether it is fan blades, cameras, powder boxes, or aircraft parts, they can all be made of "clay." According to the statements of various factories that manufacture refrigerators and automobiles, "clay" is also surprisingly useful to them. Researchers at Ford Motor Company are still making greater efforts, hoping that "clay" can make more contributions to national defense. Many people believe that in the near future, aircraft wings can also be made of "clay" to save a large amount of aluminum and stainless steel for use in other needed areas.

Artificial resin enamel has been widely used as the main raw material for manufacturing tin cans. According to estimates by the American Institute of Sciences, at least 12,000 tons of new tin can be extracted from old tin cans every year. Therefore, all homemakers are now being told to avoid discarding old cans as much as possible.

There is a Production Management Bureau organized by metallurgical experts in Washington, D.C., whose greatest purpose is to study how to manufacture substitutes for various metals needed for national defense. They focus on the saving of aluminum and magnesium; others include tin, tungsten, and lead sheets.

Artificial rubber and copper have also attracted a lot of attention. The production of rubber in the United States was originally very small, but the need was particularly high. According to the results of on-site testing, artificial rubber is no worse than natural products. Now the biggest problem is that it cannot be produced in large quantities.

"Nylon," this long-familiar artificial silk, is an excellent substitute for real silk. Currently, many people are working hard to study how to use it to manufacture parachutes.

Recently, Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the United States has also claimed that they have discovered a new so-called "magnetic steel," which can be used to replace the need for steel and copper. Steel and copper were originally raw materials for manufacturing bullets, so this is like making a very big contribution to national defense.

During the last European war, we obtained many substitutes; then in this great war, undoubtedly, we will also see a large number of novel things. Readers just wait and see, my words are definitely not nonsense.

Under the threat of the ever-increasing cost of living, I was finally forced to sell my own blood, and I am even a professional blood transfuser! After a year of blood transfusions, although I was able to fill my stomach, when I looked in the mirror, ah! I really couldn't help but scream in horror. The strong physique, full face, and bright eyes of the past, now the shadow shown in the mirror, are completely different people before and after. The strong has become weak, the full has become thin, and what about the usually bright eyes? At the same time, it is covered with a layer of gray and withered color, which is almost a living corpse. But, in order to live, I still have to struggle with a little remaining breath, take on the responsibility of my position, and save the general sick family who are more anemic and more dangerous than me, until I have transfused the last drop of blood from my own body.

However, my blood transfusion is different from others, that is, I don't have to go through the procedure of a doctor checking the blood type in advance, I only need to sell the blood I usually draw to general doctors for them to inject into patients at any time.

My blood is blue ink, and the fountain pen is of course equivalent to the envelope for drawing blood. When I put a sharp pen tip into the blue ink bottle, it is just like a needle piercing into a blood vessel. Although I temporarily feel a burst of heartache, when I think that my blood can save an anemic compatriot, my heart finally calms down.

However, the reward for blood transfusion is quite low, but it will often be devastated by general snobbish doctors - editors of publications and newspapers. Under their rash abandonment, one, two, ... all made unnecessary sacrifices. But I am only a small blood transfuser after all, what can I do about this kind of means? In addition to secretly regretting my ruined blood, I still have to put on a bitter smile in front of people, express false ease, and cover up the inner pain!

Sometimes after a long period of blood extraction, I feel even more wilted and unable to pile up for this already weak body, and I often fall on the bed, just like I have fainted, but I will not sleep so peacefully, but the rooster crows become my hypnotic clock, only the moment of dawn is the precious time for me to recover from fatigue.

I live every day in this extremely contradictory situation of "wanting to cry and forcing a smile." However, if you investigate carefully in this city, there must be many colleagues like me who are also living a painful life under the snobbish doctor's methods! (Transfer fee to help scholarship)

### Temperature-Adjusting Mattress

— Zeng Xiu

According to news from New's Scientific Pictorial magazine, inventors have recently created a mattress equipped with temperature-adjusting equipment. This news is really good news for those who like to sleep soundly. Inside that mattress, there is a novel device that can maintain a constant temperature, so it is warm in winter and cool in summer, making people who sleep on the bed feel comfortable all over. The body of the sleeping person is half-wrapped by that mattress, up to the waist, and there is no risk of overheating or overcooling, whether in winter or summer. Inside the mechanism that controls the plague degree regulator, there is a kind of electrical component, whose function is similar to the same kind of component in electric clocks, radios, toasters and electric stove pans.

Eleven Midnight Song

"Dad! Dad! I don't dare anymore! Please forgive me this time!" Thanks to Mei Bao rushing in front of him, he immediately knelt on the ground, hugged his two legs that had not yet recovered their original shape after the illness, and pleaded while crying with tears in his eyes. "Good Dad! I really didn't expect to make you so angry. Your illness hasn't fully recovered yet, please don't be too serious with me! If I go to study opera tomorrow, you can beat me to death and I won't complain..."

Mei Bao's burst of crying and shouting gradually awakened Qiu Haitang's reason.

"Dad, good Dad, sit down and rest for a while! From today on, I will never go to the Meng family again!" Mei Bao knelt on the ground and continued to sob.

Although reason has gradually recovered, the anger that has burned all over the body is not easy to suppress for a while; Qiu Haitang lowered his head, widened his eyes, looked at Mei Bao's face with tears and snot, and did not say a word for a long time.

"Dad, are you still unwilling to forgive me? My original intention was to learn opera so that we can live a more comfortable life in the future. Since Dad doesn't want me to study, isn't that easy? As long as I don't go! Fortunately, the teacher wants me to write a note..."

"Write a note?" Qiu Haitang's eyes widened even more, and a kind of panic and fear was fully revealed.

"No, Dad, I didn't write it!" Mei Bao wiped the tears from his face with his sleeves, and replied without time to spare. "Uncle Shang's uncle originally said that this piece of paper must be written by you in person, so it has been delayed until now." (176)

### Song Ya Hani Returns to the Screen After Marriage

— Zhi Yu

"Skating Queen" Song Ya Hani has been on the silver screen since "Phoenix Dance on Silver Ice". Because her skating skills are exquisite and beautiful, she has become popular in the film city, and her silver screen career has been smooth sailing. In 1938, she was ranked third among the "Top Ten Box Office Stars", second only to Shirley Temple and Clark Gable. In her first three works, "Phoenix Dance on Silver Ice", "Silver Dance Queen", and "Ice and Snow Jinghong", the main focus was on magnificent and great skating scenes, while the plot and structure were relatively important, so in terms of the audience, it is inevitable to feel the need to change the taste. Song Ya Hani herself and the company authorities were aware of this, so her fourth work, "Night Blooming Flower", is different from her previous works. In other words, "Night Blooming Flower" has surpassed any previous film in terms of the compactness of the plot and the sophistication of the structure in the performance form. However, the box office has not improved, and at the same time, Song Ya Hani has been widely reported to have married Tan Tuoping, a young rich man in New York.

Now there is news that Song Ya Hani has decided to continue acting after marriage, but she said that if her future is not smooth, then she will decide to leave the limelight. Now her new work has begun shooting, named "Sun Valley". 20th Century Fox spent 50,000 US dollars to build a skating rink for this film for her to practice. Her skating costume has become a costume similar to a bathrobe. Song Ya Hani said: "I found that this kind of tight-fitting clothes makes me skate more comfortably and can increase my speed by one time." In this film, in addition to contributing skating skills, Song Ya Hani will also sing a song, and the skating floor has also been changed from a silver-white color to a novel and unique black floor. This film is Song Ya Hani's work after marriage to change the style, let's wait and see!

Daqian Society

### Mei School Tsing Yi Gathering and Unaccompanied Singing

— Ruoqi

Wu Dou, Li Jiashan, and Li Shishan brothers play amateur opera and are all skilled in Tsing Yi. They love to play the strings. On their bath days, they invited more than ten famous Mei School amateurs and erhu masters in Shanghai to the Daqian Society for a banquet and a grand unaccompanied singing performance. Many talented people gathered in one room, talking to each other. As the strings moved, the high singing reached the clouds. In this isolated island life, which is boring and monotonous, this gathering is an extraordinary event. The author has been playing the qin for fifteen years, and although his skills still need to be improved, he did not expect to be invited because of the resonance of the ying wu. At two o'clock, I took the qin to go. The host, the Li brothers, were already there. After a while, Zhu Qinghui from Changsha, Zhu Qinggong, as well as Wen Keli, Li Baosun, Bao Youdie, Li Shiwen, Zhou Dongshan, Wang Rulin, and Lu Jusheng arrived one after another, and then the unaccompanied singing began.

First, Mr. Bao Youdie sang the Allegro and Inverted Allegro Slow Allegro of Princess Tie Jing. I and Shi Shan played the society. Youdie's voice was as clear as before, and it had a cracked tone, which was extraordinary. Shi Shan's erhu was also closely connected. Then Zhou Dongshan sang the Spring and Autumn Allegro. The qin player was Wang Rulin, an erhu amateur from Nanjing. Youdie harmonized with the erhu, which was stable and pleasing. Then Lu Jusheng sang the first part of the Tale of Genji, and Wen Keli and Zhu Qinggong cooperated to play the qin. Zhu's erhu had a particularly loud tone and no anger at all. Mr. Wen's huqin was also tightly wrapped, which was very enjoyable to listen to. Again, Li Baosun sang Life and Death Hate, and his old partners, the Zhu brothers, played for him. The two of them started and stopped their bows together, strictly like Wang Xu, which was not easy. Shi Sun's skills have been improving rapidly recently, and his good looks and suitable figure are unanimously recognized by the ticket industry. The only regret is that his singing style is deeply influenced by Xun and cannot be purely based on the Mei method. This meeting started at half past two and ended at half past seven. In such hot summer, the gentlemen sang and pulled, and no one said a word of "heat," which shows that their elegance is not shallow. On this day, the unaccompanied singing was all Tsing Yi, and there were very few old students. There was a joker in the seat who said that it was Yin Sheng Yang decline, and he could not stop smiling when he heard it. There is one more thing that I regret very much, that is, Yang Wanong, the leading Mei School amateur, is far away in the accompanying capital and cannot participate, and Ni Qiuping, the famous huqin master who is close at hand, and Shen Bainian, who was personally taught by Mei, did not come, which is a fly in the ointment.

Chapter 13 Refusing to Bow Down in the Grassroots

After a while, the wine and food were set up. When it was time to eat, Xu Jing was hungry and did not be polite, and sat down with Liu Yinying to eat and drink together. Zhang Cangqiu also asked about Li Xin's news. Xu Jing had not yet known about Li Xin's fall from the car, and said that there was no news, and he did not know whether he was dead or alive. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei could not help but sigh. They thought that Li Xin must have met with misfortune, but who knew that Li Xin was on Qingxi Mountain, newly married with Hong Niangzi, and dominating the green forest? Xu Jing's father asked the two about their recent situation. Zhang Cangqiu replied: "After we rushed to this place, we met my friend Chai Ying. He is working as a guerrilla here. Seeing that we came when we were called, he was very happy, so he led us to see General Wu. That General Wu is indeed romantic and suave, not a clumsy person. He is stationed here and can still live in peace with Manchuria. Manchuria also does not dare to start a war rashly because they have heard of General Wu's fame. His subordinates have more than 10,000 people, who can fight when advancing and defend when retreating, and can still be called a strong army. We two have been entrusted by General Wu with the position of general. Although we have been able to live here, we hate that there is no opportunity to try our copper tendons and iron ribs. If the Tartars come to invade sooner or later, I will definitely kill him happily." Xu Jing heard this, and toasted Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei each a cup with Liu Yinying. He also said to Zhang Cangqiu: "Brother Liu and I came here, but we just wanted to do something for the country and make a career for ourselves. Since General Wu is a contemporary hero and worthy of relying on, we can also settle down here and are willing to follow the two brothers and jointly hold the weapons. But I don't know where General Wu has gone at the moment, when will he return? Is there anything important?" Zhang Cangqiu said: "This time General Wu was summoned to Beijing. Yesterday, there was news that the emperor had sealed General Wu as the Earl of Pingxi, and entrusted him with great importance. General Wu is grateful for the kindness of knowing and meeting him, and he will definitely be able to spare no effort to repay the master." Chen Fei said: "We and others have heard that the power of the bandits in the customs has become a prairie fire, and we often want General Wu to ask the court to send troops to suppress the bandits and eliminate the hidden dangers. It is a pity that General Wu has not been able to promote the realization of this proposal." Xu Jing sighed: "Internal troubles are indeed worrying, but external troubles cannot be ignored. Manchuria is on the rise, Feng Zhi Chang Snake, recommending food to the upper country, ambitious and ready to move, I am afraid that General Wu will not be easily moved either." Liu Yinying also nodded in agreement. Alas! The four heroes were worried about the affairs of the country and were discussing the situation outside the customs, and they had great hope for Wu Sangui. How did they know that in this time of four suburbs and many fortresses, and the state of the earth, the romantic and elegant General Wu was in Beijing, lamenting silk and hao bamboo, selecting dance and recruiting songs, and obsessed with a peerless beauty?

### On the Past and Present of Women's Yue Opera (Part 2)

— Jintao

In addition to the advantages, I think there are also several weaknesses. ——At least it is not perfect——I am from Shaoxing, I love Shaoxing, and I want to help the Yue Opera circle even more, so I write it down, hoping that everyone in the front and back stages will pay attention to improvement.

(1) Tune

The tunes sung are too simple, lacking in change. After two or three short sentences, a long sentence follows. The end of the long sentence is always an "A" sound. Listening to this is like listening to a proclamation. It is easy to understand, but listening for a long time will feel boring and tired.——The tune is not as varied as Shenqu——My opinion is that it needs to be increased, changed, turned, and changed to make it lively and vivid. The words and tone may retain the local accent, and the tunes can be copied as much as possible, just like the inclusion of bangzi and Kunqiang in Pihuang... It is a good thing, not a bad thing, to bring everyone together in one furnace.

(2) Interlude

In some places, there are too many duets and dialogues, which are tiring for the singers and disappointing for the listeners. The play "Pan Fu" is an example. Two or three people sing for more than an hour, which is really too dull. In this kind of place, the screenwriter should use his intelligence to intersperse some relaxed actions to grab the audience's attention and interest.

(3) Other

Since Mei Lanfang of the Peking Opera circle prepared the stage curtain himself, the general famous actors have followed suit. This is not too critical. However, the flower pattern should not be too vulgar, like a wedding hall. The same embroidery and the same money. It is better to ask a beauty guard to design and draw a pattern. The color should not be too much, and the pattern should be simple and generous. How beautiful it is to hang it up!——Table skirts and chair covers need to be improved. As for "the affairs of men and women", do not perform them in a way that is close to pornography. There are ways to avoid direct performances in these places. Speaking of the front stage, although it is not a fundamental problem of Yue Opera, it is also very related. The "singing" of women's Yue Opera is not high. If the viewers cannot be quiet, it will affect the drama. Therefore, it is best for children to buy tickets, and even if they are holding babies, they must also pay full tickets, so that servants without knowledge will bring less; there will be no crying children; the whole audience is quiet, and the lyrics are sent to people's eardrums, which easily makes people feel good and can absorb a lot of Zhou Lang. There are also stage lights, which can imitate the success of the spoken drama stage. When the play starts, all the lights in the front stage, except for the ones outside the Taiping Gate and the toilet, are turned off. In this way, the audience's eyesight is not damaged, and it can also help the implementation of "silence."

(Editor's note) Mr. Jintao's opinions on the current situation and improvement of Yue Opera are practical and thorough, and are really rare concrete methods. For the sake of protecting the future of Yue Opera, we hope that Yue Opera practitioners and screenwriters and directors will pay close attention to it.
