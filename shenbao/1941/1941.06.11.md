(Reuters, 10th)

Vichy: News Received Here Last Night Stated That British Imperial Forces and the "Free French Forces" Advanced Yesterday in a Sweeping Posture.

From the Trablus Mountains to the Foothills of Mount Hermon, the British Advanced with Powerful Armored Units. Our Rearguard, with the Aid of Artillery and Air Power, Fiercely Resisted Every Inch of Ground. In the Area South of Lebanon's Coast, British Cavalry and Armored Units Were Repelled South of the Litani River. From the Litani River to Iklil El-Mish, and the Quneitra Area, Fierce Battles are Still Ongoing on the Front Line. (United Press, 10th)

London: Allied Forces in Syria are Continuing to Advance Towards Damascus and Beirut. According to a Statement Released by British Headquarters in Cairo, the Military Operations are Progressing Satisfactorily. The General Impression is That the Arab People are Responding Favorably to the Arrival of the Allied Forces.

### Weak French Resistance; Many Defect to Free French Forces

London: According to Information Received Here, Mechanized British, Free French, Australian, and Indian Forces Have Marched North into Syria and are Continuing to Advance. A Military Spokesperson in Cairo Revealed That Since Sunday Afternoon, Allied Forces Have Advanced an Average of 35 to 40 Miles, Encountering Only Scattered Resistance from the French. British Casualties are Insignificant. It is Reported That a Large Number of French Officers and Soldiers Have Defected to the Advancing Free French and British Imperial Forces. Some French Troops Have Also Ceased Fighting. It is Generally Believed That the Litani River is a Major Obstacle. The Allied Forces Have Now Crossed This River, Which is Very Satisfying. Regarding the Political Aspect of the French Reaction, There is Little Detailed Information Here. However, Based on the Current Situation, French Resistance Appears to Be Very Weak. Allied Forces Departing from Deraa and Passing Through the Djebel Druze Region are Also Progressing Satisfactorily. The Djebel Druze Region is Rocky and Rugged. Transport Vehicles Must Travel Along Highways. However, Those in the Region Who Have Been Heavily Bound are Believed to Lean Towards the British. The Highways Passing Through Deraa and Quneitra Converge 40 to 45 Miles Outside Damascus (Syria's Most Important Center). Sheikh Miskin is Between These Two Locations. Tyre is 30 to 35 Miles from Beirut. The Litani River is 10 Miles to the North. There is No Sign of Any German Action in Syria. (Reuters, 10th)

### Germany Prepares for Swift Action to Forestall Syrian War

Sweden: A Dispatch from the "Democracy Newspaper" in Berlin States That the Berlin Government Has Not Yet Issued Any Opinion on the Syrian Matter. However, Political and Foreign Circles are Extremely Concerned About This Matter. The Authorities Stated That Dealing with Rebellion and the Enemy is France's Own Affair. However, General Dentz May Seek Help from Germany. The Government Still Denies the Presence of German Troops in Syria. Those in Political Circles Say That Vichy Implies That Germany Must Act Swiftly. The Dispatch Also States That Berlin Cannot Stop the Rumors Spreading Abroad That Germans Are Entering Syria. However, Germany Has Apparently Made Some Preparations. German Officials Say That Germany is Currently Waiting for the Situation in Syria to Develop. However, According to German Military Practice, They Will Take Steps to Assist General Dentz in Resisting the British Vehicles Entering Syria. The Germans Believe That the British Military Strength Can Easily Defeat the French Army in Syria. However, If German Forces Intervene Swiftly, The British Will Have Less Chance of Victory. Another Newspaper's Dispatch from Berlin States That if France Has Decided That it is Not Strong Enough to Resist the British and Free French Forces Alone, Then Germany Will First Use Air Force to Intervene in the Syrian War. It is Worth Noting That the Germans Have Apparently Left Sicily and Established Bases in Greece and Dodecanese Islands, Which are More Suitable for Attacking the Eastern Mediterranean. The Germans Believe That the Battle of Crete Has Proven That They Can Transport Troops and Medium-Sized Weapons by Air. Also, a Military Correspondent for a Certain Newspaper States That the British Entry into Syria is Not Surprising Because the British Army Can Be Protected by British Aircraft Taking Off from Good Bases Such as Haifa, and the British Fleet Controlling the Sea Can Restrain Part of the Syrian Garrison, Preventing Them from Leaving the Coastal Areas. In the Coming Days, We Can See That the British are Still Hesitating Too Long, Which Leads to Failure. (Reuters, 10th)

Berlin: Well-Informed Nazi Sources Announced Today That Germany Wants to Adopt a Strict and Reserved Attitude Towards the Attack on Syria. They Also Said That This Attitude May Change, But It Depends on the Development of the Situation. The Authorities Here Still Say, "Dealing with the Attack on Syria is Currently Vichy's Problem, But We Admit That We are Closely Monitoring Britain's Recent Aggressive Actions." (Central News Agency, 10th)

### Turkey Deeply Concerned About the Development of the Syrian Situation

Turkey: The British Navy is Closely Watching to Ensure That the Germans Cannot Use Small Boats to Sail from the Dodecanese Islands to Syria. Germans Here Expect the British Navy to Land Troops on the Syrian Coast. But as Far as is Known, the British Navy's Activities Are Still Limited to Patrols. The Development of Syria Has Caused Significant Concern in Turkey, Causing the Afternoon Newspapers to Sell Out Quickly as the Public Scrambled to Buy Them. All Parties Welcome the Allied Actions and Hope That This Matter Can Be Resolved Quickly. The General Public Believes That the Allied Forces Will Do Their Best to Avoid Bloodshed. Well-Informed Sources Believe That the Resistance the British Army Will Encounter Will Be Minimal Because the French Army in Syria is Divided and Morale is Low. (Reuters, 10th)

London: According to News from Turkey, British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen Had a Long Talk at the Turkish Foreign Ministry Yesterday. (Reuters, 10th) Ankara: Turkish Newspapers' Comments on the Allied Entry into Syria are Quite Favorable, Considering it Timely and Inevitable. (Reuters, 10th)

Mr. Mei Said, "I Asked Them if They Only Wanted to Go Because They Wanted Adventure. Almost All of Them Replied That They Wanted to Go Because They Felt That China is Fighting for Democratic Nations." Consul General Mei Said That He Had Not Yet Received Instructions on How to Handle These Volunteers, but He Had Asked the Chinese Military Attaché in Washington for Instructions.

Editorial

### Analysis of the Syrian Conflict

The Allied Forces' invasion of Syria is not only a great misfortune for France from the perspective of the traditional relationship between Britain and France, but also a heartbreaking matter for Britain. However, from the overall international situation, Britain's preemptive action has shattered the conspiracy of Germany and Italy and eliminated a serious crisis for them.

Britain and France have had a long history of cooperation. During this European war, they were allies. Now, they have become enemies facing each other in battle. This will undoubtedly affect the morale and public sentiment on both sides and provide the common enemies, Germany and Italy, with materials for instigation. We only need to read the statements from the British and French sides in the last two days, the announcements from leaders of the Free French movement such as de Gaulle, and the statements from Germany and Italy to understand. When France collapsed last year, the most striking phenomenon was the widespread spread of defeatism, which was then filled with anti-British rhetoric. Germany and Italy took advantage of the opportunity to spread rumors that Britain was completely selfish, sacrificing France to preserve its own strength, and was ready to compromise with Germany and Italy at any time. Churchill and others tried to reverse the decline at that time and gave France the guarantee that the destinies of Britain and France were completely merged. However, under the circumstances that France was unilaterally attacked by German troops and attacked by Italian troops, it finally gave up resistance. On the road to humiliation, it was filled with resentment towards Britain. Therefore, Laval, Pétain, Darlan, and others, who were known for their anti-British inclinations, seized the opportunity to rise. They embraced the illusion that by taking the anti-British path, embarking on a pro-German and Italian road, and relying on overseas colonies and the remaining fleet, they could best join the German and Italian group; and at a minimum, they attempted to join a "new order" and obtain the same status as Spain and other countries, in order to achieve the so-called goal of maintaining the integrity of the French Empire. However, the Free French movement – the de Gaulle faction – which opposed them, called on all French overseas territories to unite thoroughly, cooperate with Britain, and fight to the end, seeking self-salvation for the French nation from the final victory. Comparing the two factions, the right and wrong are clear. The real reason why the Free French movement has not obtained the support of most of the country and why Britain has always been cautious and has not used military action to help them establish a base in French territory may be the obstruction of this anti-British sentiment in France. As for Laval and others, because of their concerns about the United States and their own notorious reputations, they have not been able to make France and Britain confront each other head-on. Under such circumstances, Britain would never use force against French territory unless it was absolutely necessary. The evolution of the situation is different from the past. Britain can only further emphasize its determination to thoroughly defeat Germany and Italy, so that the French people fully understand that Britain's victory is France's victory.

If we expand the perspective from Britain and France to the entire international community, then this Syrian event is only an inevitable consequence, and the combined efforts of Germany and Italy to move eastward are the fundamental cause. The surrender of the French Vichy authorities to Germany and Italy, using Syria as a springboard for Germany and Italy to extend into the Middle East, is the main factor that prompted its sudden outbreak. If Britain really had the so-called ambition to seize territory in Syria, as the Vichy government stated the day before yesterday, then Britain could have taken advantage of the Balkan War in the past and the tense situation in the Near East to suddenly occupy Syria from Palestine and other places without waiting for the fall of Crete and the extremely critical situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East today. If Britain occupied Syria before the situation in the Balkans changed, the French Syrian authorities would probably only have had the option of accepting cooperation with Britain at that time, and it might have affected Turkey's attitude towards the entire Balkan War. To further explore, if Britain does not take action now, then, once the forces of Germany and Italy slowly infiltrate Syria and reach a considerable number, another blitzkrieg may break out in this area, launching a large-scale attack on all of Britain's forces in the Middle East, Africa, and the Red Sea. Therefore, the public opinion in the British and American sides in the last two days has generally agreed with and praised Britain's resolute action this time. Reuters' London dispatch said that if there is any criticism of this action, then the only criticism is that it appeared too late.

Of course, how the Syrian event ends will have an extraordinarily significant impact on the evolution of the entire international situation in the future. From this perspective, its possible progress seems to be no more than three types: First, the Free French Army commanded by de Gaulle, Catroux, and others obtained the cooperation of most of the French army in Syria, all concentrated under the banner of the Free Movement, first ending the war between Britain and the Free French; the Syrian war that followed was only unfolded between Britain and France and Germany and Italy. Second, the British army quickly defeated the French army, and when the German and Italian armies rushed into Syria, a major war broke out between Britain and Germany and Italy. Third, assuming that the Vichy government therefore clashed head-on with Britain and fought alongside Germany and Italy, then not only would the war in Syria be prolonged because of this, but Britain would also add a new enemy, and the existence and free future of France itself would inevitably suffer more setbacks, which is undoubtedly true.

### Public Outrage After Handling of Chongqing Tunnel Tragedy; Newspapers Call for People to Be Paramount; Should Not Tolerate These Few Responsible Individuals

Chongqing: The newspapers and citizens of Chongqing today continued to express outrage over the fact that the officials responsible for the air-raid shelter tragedy last week, in which 461 civilians died, were only dismissed but still retained their positions. The Catholic newspaper "Yishi Bao" declared, "The government should conduct a strict self-examination and punish those who should be sentenced to death. The government should not allow a few hopeless officials to remain in office and allow tragedies to happen to civilians again." The newspaper said that the committee investigating the tragedy should put the people first and not consider personal friendships with those who should be held accountable. It also said, "Chairman Chiang should not tolerate these few responsible individuals. The responsibility for this tragedy is too great." The Communist organ "Xinhua Daily" said that Chairman Chiang only nominally dismissed those responsible, which was not commensurate with their crimes. Since the tragedy occurred last Thursday, Chairman Chiang again appointed two committees today to improve the management and technical aspects of air-raid shelters. The committee appointed to improve management includes Minister of Social Affairs Gu Zhenggang, Commander of the Gendarmerie He Guoguang, Police Chief Tang Yi (transliteration), and Secretary-General of the Chinese Red Cross Feng Jingzhou (transliteration).

### U.S. Striking Aircraft Factory Formally Taken Over by the Army; Workers' Picketing Line Dispersed with Tear Gas; Those Willing to Return to Work Will Be Protected by the Government

Los Angeles. The Army has taken over and is operating the local plant of North American Aviation because the strikers have decided not to comply with the order to return to work and have refused the union leaders' advice to allow everyone to enter the factory. Some disturbances occurred when the striking pickets prevented those willing to return to work from entering the factory, but the troops arrived and used tear gas to disperse the pickets. Only one person resisted and was injured by a bayonet, sending him to the hospital. President Roosevelt issued an order to the Army stating that he would return the factory when it could reliably be operated by private individuals in a manner required for national defense. Secretary of War Stimson has been ordered to hire workers and handle the issue of compensating the company's losses. After hearing the news of the troops entering the factory, Fretag, the leader of the strikers, telephoned President's Secretary O'Leary saying, "Armed troops cannot break our spirit. Bombers cannot be made with bayonets. We demand higher wages, but not as a slogan." Three thousand soldiers, traveling in fifty trucks, arrived and the disturbances at the factory ceased. As the soldiers passed, those waiting to return to work cheered. The soldiers occupied the entire factory in a relaxed manner, as if it were a regular exercise. Colonel Kershaw, the commander, immediately declared that the factory was reopening under government control, that anyone willing to return to work would receive the necessary protection, and that the use of troops was necessary because the situation had gone beyond the control of the local police. After receiving the President's order, the Under Secretary of the Army telephoned Colonel Kershaw, ordering him to lead troops into the factory and provide protection for workers entering the factory to return to work and for workers leaving the factory to return home after work. The President issued a statement explaining the reasons for this action, saying that the agreement established by the workers' representatives to produce and mediate had been broken, preventing mediation from proceeding, halting production, and creating a situation that hinders national defense. "As President and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, in light of this situation, I have decided to reopen the factory and ensure that work resumes immediately. Therefore, I order the Army to take over until normal operations are restored. Our country is currently in danger. Men and women who manufacture aircraft perform extremely important work in national defense. I hope the workers will return to work quickly, and their basic rights as free citizens should be protected. Negotiations will continue to establish a fair resolution." (10th Reuters dispatch)

Inglewood. Since the Army Department, following the President's orders, took over North American Aviation, 1,000 workers have returned to the factory. Although the factory is still surrounded by picketing strikers, under police protection and after the firing of tear gas, the returning workers were able to enter the factory to work. However, a spokesperson for the factory stated that work has returned to normal, but the number of workers is too small and that several workers were beaten when passing through the blockade. Roosevelt's decisive action was taken after receiving a phone call from the Los Angeles Police Department, which stated that it could no longer control the situation at the factory. The White House announced that 1,000 workers wanted to return to work but were being blocked outside the blockade line. White House Secretary Early also said that President Roosevelt's handling of the strike had been unanimously approved at the last cabinet meeting. (10th United Press dispatch)

Today, the world is divided into two major camps of democratic and totalitarian nations, and they cannot coexist peacefully.

America cannot survive in a world ruled by the views and habits of the Axis powers." (10th Haitong dispatch)

Tokyo. The Hochi Shimbun published an article stating that it is rumored that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will visit Japan this summer. Although this news has not been confirmed by Soviet officials, it may become a reality. This trip could greatly eliminate long-standing unresolved issues between Japan and the Soviet Union and consolidate the permanent friendship between the two countries. The newspaper quoted the proverb "Actions speak louder than words," saying that during his visit to the Soviet Union, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka achieved in the final ten minutes of friendly talks what had been sought but not achieved for the past ten years. Molotov went to Germany and returned successfully, so if he visits Japan this time, he will surely have the same success. If the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact has laid the foundation for friendly relations between the two countries, then the conclusion of a trade agreement, the resolution of fishing issues, and the resolution of border disputes all require attention. The resolution of various issues between Japan and the Soviet Union is not only beneficial to Japan but is also urgently needed from the Soviet Union's perspective. The tide of the German-Italian New Order is now rapidly passing through the Balkans, especially as Hitler's Near East policy seeks to seize both Iran and Afghanistan in one fell swoop.

### Commander of the British Far East Fleet Delivers Radio Address, Praising the Importance of Singapore as a Stabilizing Factor in the South Pacific

Singapore. Vice Admiral Layton, Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet, recently stated that the naval base in Singapore has become the most stable factor in the Pacific region. Layton declared, "If war spreads to the Far East, you will see the British naval flag once again covering the seas." Layton's words, which were broadcast, have the effect of preparing for any aggression. Without this naval base, the South Pacific would be at the mercy of any aggressor. Layton also said that this naval base is prepared to accommodate a large fleet and can be used by Allied fleets, providing any fleet with the necessary supplies and assistance. Layton also greatly praised the United States for providing Singapore with major military supplies. The Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet, in praising the British Dominions, Allied navies, naval volunteers, and merchant fleets, said, "When I say the British navy, I include the navies of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, India, Malaya, and Hong Kong. Recently, you have not been able to give sufficient importance to the navy in Singapore. Before the war, most of the Far East Fleet was stationed elsewhere for other needs, because it was more beneficial to serve there. But we should not consider this fact as a lack of attention to the Far East. If war spreads to the Far East, you will see the British naval flag once again covering the seas here. In recent months, you have seen the army and air force gradually arriving here, and military equipment is also flowing in. These reinforcements come from the United Kingdom, Australia, and India, and there is also equipment from the aforementioned places and the United States. Without this influx of equipment, it would be of no use. You only recognize the great material assistance of the United States by looking at the sky and seeing fighter jets, medium and heavy bombers. You must know that in addition to these obvious things, there is also a large amount of aid flowing in under the Lend-Lease Act." Layton further pointed out that the naval base in Singapore is prepared to fully play its role in accommodating a fleet that comes and goes at sea, saying, "In our minds, we have always thought of making Singapore a base capable of accommodating an Allied fleet and our own fleet. This plan is ready, and even tomorrow, we can provide any fleet with the necessary supplies and assistance." He also said that the strength of the British navy in the Pacific has clearly made Singapore the greatest stabilizing factor in the Pacific. This base, together with Hong Kong and Darwin, has a great effect in preventing any aggression. "The importance of Singapore has therefore increased in relation to the bases of our friendly countries in this region. It is no exaggeration to say that without Singapore, the South Pacific would be at the mercy of the aggressors." Layton also said that troops and guns have arrived here from the Allied countries, but these troops and equipment are still part of an activity that has been going on for months. Layton further pointed out that the fleet's aircraft play the most important role in defending Malaya. Layton revealed that preparations for the fleet's aircraft to arrive here have long been planned, and said, "I dare to tell you that these important naval aircraft can even take off from Singapore tomorrow to fight." Regarding the situation of naval activities, Layton said that in addition to the navy engaged in escorting and protecting the Pacific and Indian Oceans, there are also a large number of fleets operating very close to the coast of Malaya. "Many mines have been laid in all strategic areas along the coast of Malaya. In the past three months, we have also added many mines in case of emergency. Our navy continues to clear enemy mines in the straits near Singapore and patrols from time to time. As for the requisitioned ships, they are now used by naval volunteers, the Royal Navy, and the Malayan Navy." (10th United Press dispatch)

### Germany and Italy Search for Ships of All Sizes, Preparing for a Joint Sea and Air General Offensive; Nazis Relive the Old Dream of Kaiser Wilhelm, Attempting to Extend Their Reach to the Near East and Seize Oil Fields

Istanbul. Germany and Italy are currently searching every nook and cranny along the entire coast, from Constanta (Romania) to Genoa (Italy), at a frenzied pace, with no omissions, in preparation for an unprecedented, massive joint sea and air general offensive. Judging from the distribution of personnel, ships, and aircraft, observers believe that this general offensive will proceed on two fronts: one southward from Libya to capture Egypt, and the other into Syria to seize the Near East oil fields. According to German engineers and oil specialists who have passed through this city, the Nazi Party has clearly relived Kaiser Wilhelm's old dream of political control and railways directly from Berlin to Baghdad (the Three B's Railway). The preparations for the German expeditionary force in Greece are extremely secretive. Only German and Italian personnel and ships are allowed to enter and exit. Private traffic remains prohibited. Nationals of neutral countries such as Turkey and the United States are still not allowed to leave the country, and even American diplomatic couriers are unable to deliver their letters. It is believed that traffic in Greece will not be opened until after the general offensive begins. The lifeline of the Axis offensive is oil, so all oil tankers, large and small, in Italy have been thoroughly searched and are sailing to the Black Sea to transport oil. However, most of the Greek oil tankers have been transported away by the British, so the Axis powers are desperately searching for all available ships, even using barges on the Danube River. A batch of these ships has already passed through this city, carrying oil to Rhodes Island. Other ships are constantly loading day and night in Constanta. (10th United Press dispatch)

### German Troops Move North in the Balkans, Forcing the Soviet Union to Allow Passage

Ankara. Well-informed diplomatic circles stated yesterday that the German high command has begun a large-scale troop movement, shifting from its current positions in the southern Balkans northwards, apparently in an attempt to exert pressure on the Soviet Union, forcing it to allow German troops to pass through to Iran. These sources stated that the German high command is concentrating a large army in Moldova, purely to pressure the Soviet Union to allow German troops to proceed by sea and land from Constanta to Baku. From Baku, German troops would be able to enter Iran by train and truck. At that time, Nazi troops could seize British oil supplies, invade Iraq, and encircle Syria. Diplomatic circles also believe that German troops will once again exert pressure on Turkey, at a minimum forcing it to allow military supplies to enter Syria. However, they do not believe that Germany will make excessive demands that would lead to a conflict between the two countries. It is reported that British reconnaissance aircraft have confirmed that German troops have gathered hundreds of aircraft on Rhodes Island, and a large German army has also been concentrated there, waiting to board aircraft to enter Syria.

### Hull Meets with French Ambassador, Clarifies U.S. Position, Remains Seriously Concerned About French-German Cooperation, Deplorable to Fight with Former Allies

Washington. U.S. Secretary of State Hull told the French Ambassador, Henri Haye, during their meeting yesterday that he was dismayed that France had failed to prevent the German invasion of Syria and had instead immediately attacked British and Free French forces. It is reported that Hull also told the French Ambassador that it was deplorable if France were to fight with its former allies. Hull also told the French Ambassador that German troops appeared to have entered Syria, adding that German troops seemed to need Syria for large-scale military operations. The French Ambassador also expressed to Hull the anger of the French people at the British-French conflict in Syria. He also said that he hoped the war would only be a local incident, but declared, "Once fire is opened, accidents may happen." The French Ambassador also reiterated that there were no Axis troops in Syria. (10th United Press dispatch)

Washington. The French Ambassador to the United States, Henri Haye, visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday for an hour and expressed the French people's anger at the sudden attack on Syria. Afterwards, according to the State Department, the U.S. government saw no reason to change its serious concerns about French-German cooperation. According to well-informed sources, the Germans are using Syria to conduct aerial warfare against British forces in Iraq. France failed to defend Syria to prevent the Germans from using it, so British forces took action to enter Syria. The question now is what attitude will the French adopt. (10th Reuters dispatch)

### Anniversary of Italy's Entry into the War; Mussolini's Speech

Rome. Mussolini delivered a speech in Rome today, stating that all of Greece, including Athens, would be occupied by Italy. Greece has re-entered Italy's sphere of influence in the Mediterranean. Mussolini also solemnly declared, "I will return to Abyssinia. All the dead will be avenged. Japan cannot ignore the aggressive threats of the United States. Spain must not abandon its only opportunity to connect with the Axis powers. The intervention of the United States in the war will not trouble us. True suitability for war is no different from the current state of unsuitability for war." (10th Reuters dispatch)

Rome. The Italian Parliament will convene a special meeting at 10:00 this morning to review the achievements of the first year of the war. (10th Haitong dispatch)

Rome. On the anniversary of Italy's entry into the war, the military here reviewed the war situation, saying that the Axis control of the air over the Adriatic and Aegean Seas was the biggest achievement of the year. The gains and losses of land are not enough to determine victory or defeat. Today, the position of British forces in the Mediterranean is in extreme danger. Although Italian East Africa and North Africa have suffered setbacks, the impact is minimal. During the year, 17,622 Italian army soldiers were killed, 45,779 were wounded, and 132,523 were missing. 1,075 Navy personnel were killed, 1,301 were wounded, and 6,146 were missing. 514 Air Force personnel were killed, 825 were wounded, and 1,613 were missing. 14,390 enemy aircraft were shot down. 2,212 Italian aircraft were lost.

### British Parliament Reconvenes; Prime Minister Reports on the War Situation; Expresses Determination to Defend the Middle East; Refuses to Comment on the Hess Affair

London. Prime Minister Churchill's response today, starting at 2:46 p.m., was moderate in tone but extremely firm, stating that Britain is continuing to transport military equipment to the Middle East through various small routes and methods. "We are currently doing our best to build the strongest possible air force in the Middle East." The Prime Minister also warned the entire House that a complete explanation would inevitably leak valuable information to the enemy. The Prime Minister continued, "National production has not been disrupted, but air raids have indeed increased. The average monthly output of artillery and tanks in the first three months of 1941 increased by 50 percent compared to the last three months of 1940. We are currently maintaining the Battle of the Atlantic well. May was actually one of the best months in the Atlantic." (10th Reuters dispatch)

London. Prime Minister Churchill, when answering questions in the House of Commons today, still refused to comment on the issue of Hitler's representative Hess, who parachuted into Scotland a month ago. When a member asked whether Hess came with any proposals, the Prime Minister replied that he had nothing to say about this person at present, but the British government had informed the United States of Hess's flight to Britain.

The only thing that can be said is that Vichy's ambassador to Madrid, Pietri, had formally notified the Spanish government of my travel schedule. (10th Reuters dispatch)

### The Ying-Tu Plan Alleviates the Tense Relations Between Britain and Japan; Grew's Letter to Two Christians Acknowledges That the Time Is Not Yet Ripe for the U.S. to Convene a Peace Conference

Tokyo—According to current reports, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie's meeting with Yōsuke Matsuoka last week was primarily to explore the Japanese Foreign Minister's views on adjusting relations between the two countries. The Japanese side pointed out that British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden's meeting with Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu last Thursday was also a similar attempt. The British side sincerely hopes to use the opportunity of Shigemitsu's return to his country next month to ease the tension between Britain and Japan. Moreover, after Germany's great victory in the eastern Mediterranean, there is a growing rift between Britain and France. Therefore, Japan is in a position to demand favorable terms from Britain. However, Japanese nationalists oppose any reconciliation between Britain and Japan or the U.S. due to British aid to China and economic resistance against Japan. Meanwhile, Japanese moderates hope to avoid signing a non-aggression pact, and this matter is currently being considered in Tokyo and Washington. Diplomatic circles believe that the Axis powers are seeking to draw Japan closer to Germany and Italy to confront the democracies, which is why Axis envoys met with Matsuoka several times last week. (United Press report, 10th)

Washington—The Navy Department received a report that the American ship Robin Moor was sunk in the South Atlantic by a German submarine torpedo. This news is still awaiting confirmation, so the Navy Department has not released the original telegram received by commercial traffic circles. According to investigations, this news was initially sent by the Brazilian merchant ship Vasso Lirio via wireless telegraph and subsequently relayed by the ships Velox and Dilwroth. It is reported that Vasso Lirio discovered a lifeboat carrying many survivors. The State Department and Maritime Commission both stated that they had not received any information. According to the Maritime Commission, the Robin Moor belonged to the Seas Shipping Company of New York and carried goods such as automobiles and steel, but no munitions. (Reuters report, 10th)

Tokyo—It was learned today that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Joseph Grew's recent reply to a petition from Tokyo Christian workers was not authorized by Washington. These workers had previously urged local American residents to support the "Keep America Out of War" movement. Grew's reply stated that he deeply sympathized with the hope of keeping America out of the war, but "I believe that circumstances are about to compel us to fight for our own interests, not only for the future security of our country and the preservation of the American way of life, but also to ensure that the world enjoys a just peace and order." It is widely believed that Grew's letter was of his own accord or was issued in response to the appeal from Christian workers published in the "Japan Times and Advertiser" on June 1st. Grew's letter, dated June 3rd, was sent by the embassy for distribution. The last paragraph of the letter stated, "You are welcome to share this letter with any friends." In his letter, Grew cited a recent Gallup poll, saying that 60 percent of American families with young people of military age believe that they should enter the war if there is no other way to defeat Germany, and 85 percent of Americans believe that the United States will participate in the war before it ends. Grew continued, "You must also admit that these figures are more than sufficient to represent public opinion." He also addressed their suggestion that the U.S. launch a conference to establish a just peace order, saying, "I largely agree, but you did not specify when to take this action. In other words, I believe that you would not want the United States to convene this conference before the time is right." Grew said that based on various facts, convening such a conference at this time would inevitably fail. The Ambassador pointed out that Germany has been preparing for war for the past 75 years and has launched five wars. He concluded that Germany's current empire would not be satisfied with a just peace and order, and that one of their basic life philosophies is warfare. "I am not referring specifically to the means advocated by the Treaty of Versailles or by short-sighted European politicians in general after the last European war, but I am actually judging based on past history that Germany has never expressed satisfaction with any peace, whether the peace itself is beneficial or detrimental to them." Grew also said that the Nazis have repeatedly made promises but have never kept them, and Führer Hitler has repeatedly threatened the Western Hemisphere and the United States, so a just peace is currently impossible. He also said, "I believe that this is our war, and I share the sentiments of 79 percent of my countrymen who believe that we are already at war, even though we have not engaged in a real war. We should not be complacent in a mirage of current happiness and sit idly by as this pain expands, nor should we be short-sighted and claim that we can avoid danger. We should take decisive action once and for all to save the world's political situation." (United Press report, 10th)

### British Warships Sunk in the Battle of Crete; Britain Admits to Losing Twelve Vessels

London—Yesterday, the Admiralty stated that the anti-aircraft cruiser HMS Calcutta and two other destroyers were sunk during the evacuation of British forces from Crete. Therefore, the total losses in the Battle of Crete were four cruisers, six destroyers, and two battleships.

### Japanese National Arrested in the U.S. for Espionage

Los Angeles—Federal authorities yesterday arrested two Japanese nationals and one American national on charges of "collecting national defense information for the benefit of a foreign country." The two Japanese nationals arrested were Kazuo Kawano, 55 years old, residing in Hollywood, and Itaru Shigyō (transliteration), 39 years old. The American national was named Blake. Kawano claimed to have been the chauffeur for Hollywood star Charlie Chaplin. Shigyō had registered with the State Department two years ago as a public official of the Japanese government. He is said to be a student at the University of Southern California. (United Press report, 10th)

The Parliament decided to form a fifteen-member committee to be responsible for studying the treaty and then reporting its findings to the assembly. (Haitong report, 10th)

### Random Thoughts on the European War (63): The Seriousness of the Atlantic War

But the most important difference between now and then lies in the strength of the German Air Force. After Germany occupied bases in northern Norway and southern France, it was like adding wings to a tiger. The Germans initially used aircraft only for reconnaissance and to spread magnetic mines, and then created long-range fighters, the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor and the Junkers Ju 290, which could cross half of the Atlantic Ocean in one round trip. As a result, they used aircraft to carry out sabotage work as well. Even if Britain had the excellent base of Ireland, it would be useless without long-range fighters.

The fall of France also had a major impact. After Germany seized a portion of the French warships, it discovered that they were equipped with secret weapons to attack submarines, such as submarine detectors. After studying them, the Germans used new tactics to deal with them.

During the last European War, Britain was able to freely use the Mediterranean Sea as a supply route. This time, since Italy joined the war, Britain has not been able to take the shortcut. Since June of last year, Britain has only once assembled a large convoy to pass through the Mediterranean Sea, and as a result, it was heavily attacked by German and Italian dive bombers. The light cruiser HMS Southampton was sunk, and the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious was severely damaged. As a result of this threat, British merchant ships not only had to detour around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, but also had to dispatch a large number of warships to the Mediterranean Sea, which weakened the defensive strength of the Atlantic Ocean. Germany seized this opportunity to dispatch raiding ships to disrupt British merchant ships by stealth.

Also, during the last European War, the threat of submarines was the only terrifying thing. Now, there are endless things to fear. According to Britain's recent announcement, the causes of shipwrecks are as follows: those sunk by submarines accounted for 39 percent, those sunk by aircraft accounted for 23 percent, those sunk by mines accounted for 22 percent, and those sunk by warships and for unknown reasons each accounted for 8 percent. Moreover, since Germany began using long-range aircraft for bombing, the number of merchant ships lost to aerial bombs has become even more considerable.

Britain's current convoy plan is drawn up daily by the Admiralty. In the map room of the gray old Admiralty building near Trafalgar Square in London, a group of officers and staff surround a huge map table every morning, inserting colored pins into the map. Each pin represents a ship, and its color identifies whether it is a convoy ship or an independent ship, and whether it is on its way out or on its way back.

After the map room staff mark the exact location of each ship at sea with pins, they hand the map over to another room for convoy experts to carefully study. Based on information about the locations of German submarines, raiding ships, and aircraft activity, they determine the safest route. In the afternoon, this map and the planned route are sent to the Naval Staff for review and approval. Finally, it is transmitted by wireless telegraph to the headquarters of Admiral Sir Max Horton, Commander-in-Chief, Western Approaches, in a port in western Britain.

Admiral Horton and his subordinates then issue orders by wireless telegraph to each ship at sea. If it is a convoy, the escort ships, usually two destroyers, are notified, and a medium-sized cruiser is inserted to protect 20 to 60 merchant ships.

The serious situation of British merchant ship losses is a source of anxiety for everyone from Prime Minister Churchill to ordinary citizens. How Britain can obtain 3 to 4 million tons of merchant ships this year to make up for the current rate of loss in order to sustain itself until next year is a difficult problem. Relying solely on Britain's own shipbuilding rate is absolutely impossible. Britain's shipbuilding performance this year will be at most one million tons, and after the bombing of various shipyards, it may be reduced to around 750,000 tons.

Meat is Britain's main import (Note 4). Since the start of the war, due to disrupted supply routes, the weekly purchase limit for beef, lamb, and pork has been gradually reduced from two shillings and two pence to one shilling, which can buy one pound. The shortage of alloy metals should not be underestimated either. The assembly of army tanks can no longer use alloy steel and must use more brittle steel instead.

The general public in British society hopes that the United States will come to their aid. The British delegation in Washington hopes that the United States will help with 500 to 600 tons of merchant ships. Prime Minister Churchill also said that Britain's future prospects depend on the United States building ships on a large scale, as it did in 1918. However, increasing the shipbuilding rate cannot be done in a short period of time. The highest shipbuilding rate in the United States this year will be at most 1.1 million tons (Note 5).

Of course, the United States has other ways to help Britain, and President Roosevelt has already prepared some of them or has already implemented them. The 290,000 tons of German, Italian, and Danish merchant ships that the President has detained (which is equivalent to three weeks of losses for British ships) may be transferred to Britain. As for the U.S. ships sailing to the Red Sea, the hundreds of new ships built under the Lend-Lease Act with $500 million, and the convenience of allowing British merchant ships to be repaired in U.S. ports, although they are good measures, they all take time and cannot take effect immediately. The only effective action that the United States can truly take this year is to implement ship escort or send naval aircraft to assist the convoys in reconnaissance work.

(Note 1) The tonnage of merchant ships owned by various countries at the outbreak of this European War was as follows: Britain 21,215,261 tons, the United States 14,612,991 tons, Japan 5,629,845 tons, Norway 4,834,902 tons, Germany 4,492,708 tons, the United States 3,448,453 tons, the Netherlands 2,972,871 tons, France 2,952,975 tons, Greece 1,780,666 tons, Sweden 1,581,919 tons, the Soviet Union 1,315,766 tons, and Denmark 1,176,173 tons.

(Note 2) From June to November 1940, British merchant ship losses were the heaviest, averaging 63,000 tons per week. The week of September 14 to 20 was the highest, reaching 200,5781 tons.

(Note 3) The naval tonnage of various countries at the outbreak of this European War was as follows: Britain 1,161,000 tons, the United States 1,072,000 tons, Japan 841,000 tons, France 501,000 tons, Italy 417,000 tons, the Soviet Union 240,000 tons, Germany 178,000 tons, Spain 133,000 tons, Argentina 101,000 tons, Sweden 85,000 tons, Chile 70,000 tons, the Netherlands 60,000 tons, and Brazil 54,000 tons.

(Note 4) Britain normally imports 50 million tons of goods each year, which are transported by 9,000 merchant ships and 159,000 sailors. The quantities of main imported items are as follows: 5 million tons of wheat, 470,000 tons of butter, 145,000 tons of cheese, 660,000 tons of beef, 360,000 tons of mutton, 375,000 tons of pork, 520,000 tons of bananas, 345,000 tons of apples, and 21 million bunches of bananas.

(Note 5) The U.S. government and businesses currently have 1,233 seagoing vessels, totaling 7,279,196 tons, with 450 more under construction. The U.S. shipbuilding rate was highest in 1920, with nearly 3 million tons built throughout the year.

Correction: In the article "The Seriousness of the Atlantic War" published in this column on the 9th of this month, the eleventh line of the second paragraph should read "not more than 13 million tons" instead of "not more than 1.3 million tons." We hereby correct this error.

### Food: Imported Rice Prices Constantly Rising; Over 67,000 Bags of Saigon Rice Continue to Arrive

The imported rice market, which had once weakened in the previous period, was reactivated yesterday by domestic merchants and rural customers taking advantage of lower prices. The early opening saw tight conditions, followed by speculators and new major hoarding households joining in the fray, causing a stir in the market. Prices rose repeatedly amid support, with rumors spreading of an American ship being lost en route (which was actually unrelated to the rice market). This, coupled with the stimulus of the previous day's small shipments being blocked, caused both spot and futures rice prices to rise by two to three yuan. No. 1 Saigon rice reached 120 yuan, high-quality Min rice reached 122 yuan, Shanghai Pudong small shipments reached 115.5 yuan, No. 2 Siam rice reached 112 yuan, Huowen rice reached 118 yuan, and Sui Jian rice reached 93 yuan. At this point, the buying momentum weakened, and speculators who had profited began to sell at high prices, causing the upward trend to subside. Da Fu foreign firm then offered 2,000 tons of small shipments at 136.5 yuan, as well as No. 1 Siam rice at 131.5 yuan and No. 2 at 127 yuan. Customers from inland Ningbo and other areas, whose previous orders had not yet been cleared, returned to the market to sell, and those who had profited also took the opportunity to sell at high prices, causing the market to turn downward. Except for broken rice, which still had some demand, other prices dropped by two to three yuan. As a result, broken rice saw a relatively large increase of nearly one yuan. The spot price for No. 1 rice from Yinghua Company opened at 136.5 yuan, small Huowen rice at 137-138 yuan, and broken rice at 108.5-108 yuan. The total transaction volume for Yinghua Company was 700-800 tons, and the spot rice volume was 12,000-13,000 bags.

The sales of thick and thin Japonica rice in the local market were still sluggish. Fortunately, the supply was also scarce, so the market remained flat. The price of early and late rice from Nan Gang was still 126-127 yuan for fresh specialty grade, 134-135 yuan for ordinary grade, and 130 yuan for second grade. Unopened original bags of thin Japonica rice from Wuxi were 121-122 yuan.

The Hong Kong Yuan price of glutinous rice continued to rise amid reports of scarce goods, and market sentiment was unusually firm. Selling prices continued to rise, with special grade round grain from Hong Kong opening at 117-118 yuan, long grain rising from 115-116 yuan to 113 yuan. Only second-grade glutinous green beans were offered yesterday at 102-103 yuan. Domestic glutinous rice was expensive and of poor quality, and sales were flat, making it difficult to compete with the Hong Kong Yuan price. It could only maintain its position without any significant gains or losses.

Jin Diya of the French company continued to ship tribute rice, which arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 9th). 14,500 bags of foreign rice were shipped from Saigon, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the company's D'Artagnan postal ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying a large amount of foreign rice weighing 6,680 tons, totaling over 67,000 bags, which docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong to unload.

### Current Price of Vermicelli Follows High Rice Prices

Spot vermicelli trading has gradually become more active, due to the increasing transshipment volume by merchants from northern China. The opening prices were 28.8 yuan for Golden Dragon vermicelli, 28.9 yuan for God of Wealth vermicelli, 30.015 yuan for Battery vermicelli, and 30.02 yuan for Flower Bird vermicelli, all rising steadily. In the afternoon, the market improved further. Golden Dragon vermicelli was favored by hoarding households and jumped over the 29 yuan mark to 29.3 yuan, a gain of 0.7 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was approximately 20,000 bags, and the market began to show signs of expansion.

Yesterday, wheat trading remained quiet. Although new wheat has entered the market, production is not high, and shipments to Shanghai are still complicated. In addition, the supply of old wheat in the city has dried up, and factories have no appetite to purchase. Therefore, the market remains stagnant.

### Oil Cakes: Soybean Cake Bears Dominate

The market conditions for miscellaneous grains yesterday were mostly small-scale. Soybean cakes continued to be strong, but prices fluctuated up and down. As a result, the bears dominated, and the market fell by another one to two jiao compared to the previous day. The transaction volume for all cakes was 33,000-34,000 pieces. Yellow soybeans remained weak, and although sales to local oil extraction factories continued, the volume was not large. Therefore, the supply was plentiful but sales were slow, and the market was often in a state of prolonged weakness. At the time of rushing to purchase new broad beans, the price once tightened and rose, but recently, due to high prices and poor quality, customer sales have been disconnected. Local sales on the street are still feeling excessive, resulting in lower prices. Yesterday, 300 bags of new white broad beans from Jiading were traded at a price of 39.5 yuan per original plate. The market for corn was still acceptable, but due to high inventories, it was difficult to cause a special surge. The fleeting boom that occurred previously has reversed, and prices have fallen again by one to two yuan. The total transaction volume for new and old yellow and white corn was approximately 2,000 bags.

### Dried Fruits: High Production Price of Xiamen Tangerine Cakes

Due to the high production price of Xiamen tangerine cakes, there have been no recent arrivals. According to a letter from the production area, the price that can be agreed upon for shipment to Shanghai has exceeded the previous market price by more than double. Therefore, we have not dared to try for the time being. It is necessary to wait until the selling price is close to the price that customers can accept before there can be continued arrivals.

### Finance: Speculators Madly Infill Foreign Exchange at Noon, Exceeding the Volume Traded in the Morning

The foreign exchange market conditions yesterday saw no change in the HSBC-posted rates for various currencies. However, the black market for British and U.S. exchange suddenly turned soft. In the morning opening, Chinese speculators were the first to cover their positions, infilling more than 100,000 U.S. dollars. Hong Kong telegrams also came to cover their positions. At that time, Japanese Mitsui & Co. and foreign banks were providing supply, and the volume was relatively abundant. The prices at this time were relatively flat, and at noon foreign telegrams reported news of an American merchant ship being sunk again by Germany in the South Atlantic. Speculators turned to madly infill, exceeding the volume covered since the morning opening. The next-month price of U.S. dollars, 5.40625 yuan, was once difficult to sell. The price of British gold also hardened to 3 shillings and 3.125 pence. In the afternoon, speculative selling intentions decreased slightly, and Chinese banks absorbed less, so the trend stabilized. The closing price for British long was 0.015625, and the closing price for U.S. long was 0.03125. The overall trading volume for the day was quite active.

Hong Kong Parties Infills at Morning Market

Since the morning foreign telegrams showed that the silver market in England, America, and India had not changed, the exchange rate for U.S. dollars against Shanghai alone was slightly lower, with the rest unchanged. The Central Bank's posted rates for various currencies did not change. The bank selling prices in the domestic market opened flat in the morning. The spot price for British exchange was 3 shillings and 296875 pence, and the spot price for U.S. dollars was 5.34375 yuan. Chinese speculators, following the trend of infilling the previous day, covered their positions for the June U.S. exchange price of 5.34375 yuan, totaling tens of thousands of yuan. At that time, foreign banks' willingness to supply was still strong, and the HSBC-posted rates for various currencies were flat. After the silver balance tax was still levied at 2.375 percent, Japanese banks Mitsui & Co. sold out the July price of 5.375 yuan. Foreign firms were short on supply, and Chinese merchants and Hong Kong telegrams again came to cover their July price of 5.379 yuan. At noon, negative news arrived, and speculators turned to madly infill the July price of 5.40625 yuan, which once hardened to the point where it was difficult to sell, but it soon recovered slightly. The noon closing price for British exchange was 3 shillings and 3.125 pence, and the noon closing price for U.S. dollars was 5.375 yuan.

Both British and U.S. Exchange Sees "Long" Prices

The afternoon market was sluggish and trading was scarce. A Chinese bank intended to infuse speculator's July U.S. Dollar contract for 5.390625 Yuan, but did not open. The 3:30 PM closing price, both spot and for the July contract, saw British exchange at 3 shillings and 3.25 pence, and U.S. Dollars at 5.375 yuan, compared to the previous day's closing price, with the spot price for both British and U.S. exchange seeing a "long" price of 0.015625 and 0.03125, respectively.

### Hong Kong Telegrams Sell Off, Pressing Down Gold Prices; But Settlement Is Based on the U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate, Only Doing the 5 Yuan Trend

Yesterday, the heated black market for gold saw slight changes, initially rising slightly, then suddenly falling sharply, and then returning to a plateau. After breaking through the 6,500 yuan mark, it immediately fell back in. This was because foreign exchange brokers were the first to sell off at high prices. Heng Ji Silver Company also sold off 3,000-4,000 taels on behalf of Hong Kong telegrams, suppressing the rising trend. As a result, foreign exchange began to soften, and prices became unsustainable, leading to a rebound and decline. Near noon, news of an American merchant ship being sunk by a German submarine spread, and sellers became even more enthusiastic. Under the condition of prices being easy to suppress and difficult to raise, the price retreated from 6,506 yuan to 6,450 yuan. At noon, floating shorts covered their positions, slightly raising the price. In the afternoon, foreign exchange stabilized, and the price fluctuated only by 15 yuan, around 6,470 yuan. The final decline was small, at 22 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was over 30,000 taels. The closing price was 6,472-3 yuan. Spot gold saw even less improvement. Cheng Ji sold 100 taels in the morning, and Xiang Xing Yong sold 20 taels, both of which were purchased by Shi He at a price 250 yuan higher than the futures price. In the afternoon, De Fu sold 100 taels to Xiang He, and entered and exited Shi He at 40 taels, all at a price 255 yuan higher. Shi He also entered 90 taels from Cheng Ji at a price 252 yuan higher, resulting in a small decline of 30 yuan. The price of jewelry gold also fell by 5 yuan, totaling 690 yuan.

Futures Only Fall by 22 Yuan

The opening price for each bar (10 taels) in the morning at 9:15 was 6,505 yuan, 9 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day. It then saw 6,506 yuan. Xin Feng Yong, Da Feng, De Da, and Ren Cheng Yong came to sell, and the price immediately retreated to 6,485 yuan, due to floating longs entering the market. The Gold Trade Association helped push the price up to 6,494 yuan. The Securities Association sold off, and the price plateaued at around 6,485 yuan for a long time. Near noon, negative rumors suddenly arose, and He Sheng, Sui Fu, Heng Ji, De Da, Yu Qing Yong, and retail investors sold aggressively. The price plunged by more than 30 yuan to 6,450 yuan. Xiang Yu Yong and Jin Yuan entered aggressively, raising the price to 6,465 yuan, and then it fell again. The noon closing price was 6,459 yuan. The market opened 6 yuan higher at 2:00 pm, reaching 6,465 yuan. He Sheng and Ren Cheng Yong sold off a small amount to 6,460 yuan. Chi Da, Xin Feng Yong, and De Fu came to buy in. The market trend was extremely stable, and the price rose to 6,475 yuan. The closing price at 3:30 was 6,474 yuan, a decline of 22 yuan. The settlement price based on the June U.S. dollar rate of 5.375 yuan was 6,479 yuan, a drop of 5 yuan. The fluctuations for the whole day were 56 yuan. The selling price of the current gold of Yu Hao was 270 yuan higher than the heated futures price, and the purchase price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the current margin.

### Remittance Water Rises, Once Exceeding 10 Yuan; Then Gradually Declines

Yesterday, the discount rate for remittance drafts fluctuated greatly, once reaching over 10 yuan for those selling cash, and then gradually declining to 1 yuan. The other side leveled off, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry association's overnight interest rate suddenly fell by 4 points, with both morning and afternoon markets posting 3 points.

### No Significant Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the spot price of silver fall, both spot and forward. British and American gold pounds each fell by one yuan.

Singapore notes had a slight increase in supply, and the market price was slightly weak. Japanese gold notes rebounded after falling, remaining at 1.92 yuan in the evening session. Korean notes showed a slight upward trend, rising to 1.63 yuan in the evening session.

### Securities: Public Bonds Gradually Weakening

The public bond grey market continued its downward trend yesterday. After satisfying many parties, there has been covert selling. Yesterday morning, De Fu Hong bought more, and Lianhe Yu, Da Yi, and Tai also had demand. Initially, Xie sold out a lot, and Lianyi also released bonds. Near the close, Yi sold out a large amount, further driving down the market. The noon close was slightly down by 4 or 5 jiao. However, there were very few Ding-type transactions, so they slightly increased by 3 jiao. In the afternoon, Hong Da and Lian He continued to buy, Runde bought Type B bonds, and Da De bought Type A bonds. The opening market was slightly higher, but Ding Kang sold a lot, Xie Kang and Lian Yi continued to sell, and Tong Kang exchanged Type E for Type C. The market price continued to weaken. As a result, except for Type D, which did not open in the afternoon and rose by 3 jiao, the rest consistently decreased by 3 to 5.5 jiao. The total turnover was approximately 2.2 million to 2.3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.

In stock trading, 1,000 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of 7.95 yuan.

Furthermore, the stock market of the Public Industry Association was relatively active, with several stocks experiencing significant price increases. Xiangtai Timber surged the fastest, reaching a high price of 48.5 yuan. Jardine Matheson also rose to 96 yuan. Reclamation shares were at 24.25 yuan. Sentiment towards industrial shares generally improved, while rubber shares remained sluggish.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Sales Not Weak; Shuangma Initially Rose but Ultimately Fell

The yarn market initially rose and then softened, but actual transactions continued uninterrupted. Twenty-count Shuangma yarn was reportedly being shipped overseas, leading some to expect prices to rise. However, gold and securities traders mostly used the margin as a guide, fluctuating quickly, making it difficult to predict. As a result, changes were rapid. It was found that Hong Kong traders bought a huge 2,690 bales of various yarns. Based on this, the market should have been optimistic. However, some speculators believed that the Pacific issue had not yet been resolved, and since the high point could not break through 460 yuan, selling intentions were strong. As rumors spread, prices declined again. The high price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,458 yuan, and the low price was 1,434 yuan. The afternoon momentum was not as lively as the previous day, but the market was soft yet firm. The initial price was 1,441 yuan, rose to 1,446 yuan, fell back to 1,439 yuan, and the final price was 1,441.2 yuan. This morning, 2,000 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.

Shuangma opened this morning, continuing the enthusiasm of the previous day, with the opening price at 1,458 yuan. Many profitable traders sold at this price, leading to a tight situation. Shortly after, it fell slightly to 1,449 yuan. There was a struggle in this 50-yuan range. Then, news came that the margin had eased, and rumors spread again, saying that an American merchant ship had been attacked, causing panic. It fell immediately to 1,436 yuan. However, the sales of spot yarn were not weak, and many people bought at the low price, pushing it back up to 1,442 yuan. The closing price was 1,439 yuan. It was found that the total turnover for half a day was 9,790 bales. The amount bought by each trading group is listed as follows: Hong Kong 2,690, Domestic 7,100, Total 9,790.

Due to the strong upward trend of the previous day, the futures market for Jin Shuangma label yarn experienced a slight reversal. At the same time, profitable traders sold off, and the market loosened. It was found that the July contract fell by 7 yuan compared to the previous day, and the August contract fell by 16.5 yuan. The total turnover for the front and back sessions was approximately 5,000 bales. The high, low, and closing prices are listed below.

### Cotton Market Prospering: Brazilian Cotton Mills Have Fixed Prices

The spot cotton situation is very profitable because American cotton is rising daily, and sentiment is firm. Therefore, fine cotton is only rising and not falling. However, coarse cotton is far less strong than fine cotton. Although the opening trading volume for factory brands Liangcheng Fang is not as high as in the previous days, it can be said to be quite busy. Overall, the scene is promising. Yesterday, a total of 740 pieces and 1,500 bales were traded, with prices falling by 1-2 yuan.

Brazilian Cotton 418 Anda Factory 100 pieces factory

Indian NT 400 Shenxin Factory 200 pieces plus

Changyinsha 250 plus 960 bales plus

Midlin 428 Haojia 100 pieces stack

Plus 431 Plus 140 pieces plus

Plus 426 Plus 100 pieces plus

Sudan Cotton 514 Plus 100 pieces plus

Huocaobao 188.5 Plus 540 bales plus

In addition, according to Shanghai's foreign cotton trade by foreign firms, the yarn market is gradually rising, and the international situation is developing favorably, which has boosted confidence and led to enthusiastic buying. Factories such as Shenxin and Yong'an, and traders such as Dachang and Shunda, have all traded large quantities of Brazilian cotton. As American and Indian cotton continue to rise, everyone expects prices to rise, so the future of the cotton market is expected to be prosperous.

The New York cotton market initially rose sharply due to foreign merchants buying, but then fell slightly due to some profit-taking. As a result, closing prices were 9 to 16 points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market also rose due to cotton merchants constantly replenishing Amra, with closing prices rising by 2 to 7 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market will rise by 1.5 rupees due to the strong rise in American cotton.

### Piece Goods: Ewo Coarse Cloth Exceptionally Strong

Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday, and the quoted prices of various cloths changed very little. However, due to the varying amount of actual sales, some prices fluctuated slightly. As a result, Ewo coarse cloth rose by 2.5 jiao due to the factory's firm stance and continued purchases by Nanyang traders. Coarse twill fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao due to the gradually increasing inventory. Some of Ewo Lun Chang's bleached and dyed cloths rose by 5 jiao. Approximately 300 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders bought over 200 pieces of colored cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and twill. Nanyang traders bought over 300 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. Today, 1,230 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: The morning market fell with the yarn. The afternoon market saw the Longtou fine cloth stack fall to 44.5 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge to 1.4445 yuan. The market stabilized in the afternoon as Shuangma rebounded. Longtou fine cloth rose back to 44.7 yuan, and Serge closed at 1.444875 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Forward Sugar Settling; Spot Prices Fall Again

Yesterday, the June 10th forward sugar expired. It was heard that some people in the vegetable industry had completed delivery according to the Public Concession rules, but others were still in a stalemate. It was found that the sharp drop in prices this time was due to market forces, not due to short sellers driving down the price. It is clear from the recent spot market trading that the bullish side did not make high claims against the Public Concession. The Public Concession's trading for May arrival of spot goods 24 coarse white foreign stack initially fell by 5 jiao to 93 yuan, and then fell by 9 jiao to 92.1 yuan, a total decrease of 1.4 yuan. There was a lack of follow-up market, indicating that supply exceeded demand and it would not be easy to raise prices for a while.

### Coal: Coal Balls Gradually Stabilizing - 10 Yuan Cheaper on the Grey Market

The price of coal balls has been gradually falling and stabilizing recently since the factory price was increased by 20 yuan at the beginning of the month, which caused much resentment from all sectors. Although the list price of each factory is still 316 yuan, the grey market price is 10 yuan cheaper, with a line price of 306 yuan. Delivery adds additional transportation costs. The street storefronts are also very chaotic, with a maximum of 16.6 yuan per load, which is cheaper than the fixed price.

### Cotton (3)

- Gao Jiannong

Initially, there were no machines for treading or bow spinning. Instead, the cotton was separated by hand, and the line strings and bamboo arcs were placed on the table and shaken into a paste, which was a very difficult task. In the early years of the dynasty, an old woman named Huang Daopo came from Yazhou and taught people how to make machines for carding, spinning, and weaving, as well as methods for mixing yarn colors, assembling threads, and padding flowers. As a result, the woven quilts, belts, and handkerchiefs had patterns of branches, phoenixes, chessboards, and characters, which were as clear as if they had been painted! People were taught and competed to make them, and then traded them to other counties. Families became prosperous. Not long after the old woman died, people were grateful and cried over wine, and they jointly offered sacrifices to her and built a shrine for her, which they enjoyed every year. Therefore, the Yuan Dynasty specially established the "Kapok Lifting Department" in the southern provinces of China to manage tax collection. When the Ming Taizu first established the country, he also ordered: "Civilians with 5 to 10 mu of land should plant half a mu each of soft mulberry and 'kapok'." This shows the country's emphasis on kapok, and it also shows that kapok has since spread to all parts of China, and it is no longer exclusively patented by the South, as Xie Fangde sang: "Good trees are planted with kapok, Heaven is so kind to Fujian."

### The Result of Japan's Invasion of China: Financial Situation Extremely Dire; Domestic Recession Prevents Absorption of Public Debt; Only Option is to Seek Help from Overseas Chinese

Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, it has been nearly four years. It has consumed huge financial, material, and human resources, not only without any gains, but also with no way to quickly end the war. As a result, it is difficult to sustain it for long, and financial difficulties are the most serious problem. Therefore, most of Japan's military spending in China has had to rely on the issuance of public debt.

Severe Budget Deficit This Year

Due to a severe budget deficit this year, it is planned to issue a huge 1.5 billion yuan in public debt to make up for it. However, because the domestic people are affected by the recession, their ability to absorb public debt is weak. As a result, the results of the 22nd savings bond and the 8th patriotic bond sold by the Japan Hypothec Bank were very poor. The Japanese Ministry of Finance then decided to find ways to solicit money from Japanese people living overseas.

Dispatching Personnel to Shanghai to Vigorously Promote Sales

Therefore, the bank was entrusted by the National Savings Promotion Bureau of the Ministry of Finance and sent two of its employees, Kiyohiko Ozaki and Makoto Tanabu, to Shanghai. They, together with the Central China Finance Office of the Ministry of Finance and the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, tried to persuade Japanese expatriates and Japanese merchants living in Shanghai and other parts of Central China to purchase the two bonds. The total amount issued this time was 100 million yuan, and it was stipulated that Japanese expatriates in Central China must subscribe to 1 million yuan. The bonds were issued in various Japanese commercial banks from June 14 to July 10.

### Shanghai Postal Rights: Further Encroached; Airmail Transfers from Occupied Areas Handled by Japanese Aircraft

According to a notice from the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, airmail money orders from various bureaus in the occupied areas of Central and South China should be resumed from today. The verification of these money orders should be handed over to aircraft operating on various air routes run by the so-called China Aviation Co., Ltd. If these verification documents cannot be transported by air for the entire journey, they should be handed over to aircraft as much as possible in the middle to speed up the process. In addition to the normal money order fee and water replenishment fee, a national currency fee of 2.5 jiao will be charged for each airmail money order, regardless of the amount of the remittance. Other procedures will be handled in accordance with the airmail money order regulations, Director Zha Peilin.

Very High Remittance Fees: According to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, the designated locations for airmail money orders between Shanghai and Central and South China are Anqing, Hangzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Nanjing, and five other locations. The remittance fees are very high. For example, for airmail money orders from Shanghai to Hankou, in addition to the normal money order fee of 1 fen per yuan, an additional water replenishment fee of 5 fen is added. The remittance fee to Hangzhou is the same. For Anqing, in addition to the normal money order fee of 1 fen per yuan, an additional water replenishment fee of 2 fen is added. For Guangzhou, in addition to the normal money order fee of 1 fen per yuan, an additional water replenishment fee of 1 fen is added. For Nanjing, in addition to the normal money order fee of half a fen, an additional water replenishment fee of half a fen is added.

Infringement of Postal Rights: It was found that the airmail money order fee for remittances between Shanghai and various free areas in China, such as Chongqing and Kunming, is only 1 li (i.e., 1/1000) per yuan. The airmail postage fee is only 1.5 jiao per piece (2.5 jiao for Central and South China). This is due to the increase in airmail postage fees by Japanese operators. Moreover, the establishment of airmail money orders in the occupied areas is still an innovation after the Shanghai war. Therefore, those who care about Shanghai's postal affairs are worried about the increasing encroachment on postal rights.

### Japanese Open Fire on Shotguns for No Reason, Injuring Four Female Workers

The French national anthem was played loudly, and the soldiers raised their guns to salute. After a while, Gossmart left in the original car. It was heard that Gossmart would only stay in Shanghai for a few days before leaving for somewhere else, but where he was going has not been announced. Recently, there has been talk of replacing the French Ambassador to China, but according to reliable sources, the French government has already abandoned this idea. Since Gossmart has been in office, his communication between the two countries has been smooth, and the French government is willing to retain Gossmart so that he can continue to be familiar with the job. Gossmart is nearly 50 years old. When he arrived in Shanghai yesterday, his entourage was very simple. He wore a gray felt hat and a gray suit. Although he had traveled a long distance, he was in good spirits. As for the rumors that Gossmart arrived in Shanghai on the French Shipping Company's Dada Nan yesterday, it is completely untrue.

It is said that the rice has been approved by the authorities of the French Concession and ordered by the Rice Import Committee, and will be sold in the city at the lowest price.

Calm People, No Price Increase

Yesterday in the rice market, after news spread that a certain ship carrying 1,000 tons of small-pattern rice by Dadou Foreign Company had been detained in Yangon, some rice weevils thought that they could take this opportunity to raise prices. Therefore, immediately after the market opened, they shouted high prices. Since the people were calm and no one was interested, all the rice weevils were disappointed and had to lower prices to release them. Therefore, yesterday's market price was still the same as the previous day, with no significant decline.

Yongchang Rice Store Resumes Sales

Yongchang Rice Store at 278 Datong Road was found to have mixed rice and its right to sell cheap rice was revoked after the Public Works Department and Qianxiangmao Foreign Company sent personnel to investigate and confirm. The rice store repeatedly requested but was not allowed. In addition, residents throughout the city are currently buying cheap small rice, so various types of rice are neglected. The owner of the store, Zhao Junsun, found it difficult to maintain business and personally went to the Cheap Rice Handling Agency to appeal and applied to the Public Works Department. The Bureau, in order to take into account the business operations, agreed to the request to observe the results.

### The Public Works Department Will Discuss Increasing Staff Salaries Today; Detailed Content Not Available Yesterday; It Is Said that the Total Salary Will Be Increased by 14%

The Public Works Department will hold a regular meeting today (10th) and will make a decision on a further salary increase for all employees of the Bureau.

Considering a Salary Increase for Several Weeks

The Bureau has been considering a salary increase for all employees for several weeks.

Currently, the total cost-of-living allowance received by Public Works Department employees is 1.5 times the base salary. It is said that the Bureau has been considering gradually increasing this allowance to two times.

Or It Will Be Divided into Several Levels

Some people believe that the Bureau may decide today to only increase the allowance by about 12%. If the current situation does not improve, it will continue to increase by 12% to 13% later. Moreover, the Bureau's decision to increase salaries today will be divided into several levels, so that employees who are more affected by the high cost of living will receive more allowances. At the same time, reliable sources recently claimed that employees of the French Concession Bureau may receive a uniform salary increase starting next month. However, the French Bureau refused to disclose any information on this.

All Parties Pay Attention to the Increased Amount

According to the Zilin News, the proposal to increase the cost-of-living allowance for the Bureau's employees submitted by the Public Works Department's Personnel Committee is expected to be discussed at the Board of Directors meeting of the Public Works Department tomorrow (11th). It was found that the current cost-of-living allowance received by Public Works Department employees is 150% of the base salary. It is said that the increased amount recommended by the Personnel Committee after detailed research on the living conditions of Chinese and Western employees is less than 180%. All parties are paying close attention to this proposal, because the remuneration of employees in other industries in the city is now mostly determined by the income of Public Works Department employees. Some people are skeptical about the increase in salaries or allowances for Public Works Department employees.

It Will Inevitably Affect the General Price of Goods

According to well-informed sources, after the Public Works Department announces a salary increase for employees, the prices of food and necessities in the city will inevitably rise accordingly, and the amount by which food and other prices rise will always exceed the amount by which Public Works Department employees' salaries or allowances increase. The first to suffer from the high cost of living will be the junior employees of many businesses, because the proportion of their increased income is not as much as that of Public Works Department employees.

### Shanghai Hospital Equipment Borrowed and Applied; No One Went to Remove It Yesterday; The French Police Have Sent Personnel to Check

After the medical equipment of Shanghai Hospital at 172 Qiqi Road in the French Concession was moved out, a doctor from the hospital said yesterday that after Director Hai Jingge appealed to all parties for the borrowing of all necessary equipment, it has been roughly prepared, so the treatment work in the hospital can proceed as usual. No one went to remove it yesterday, but the French police still sent two Vietnamese police officers to guard the hospital yesterday.

### Zhejiang Province Highway Passenger Tickets Increased

According to information from the transportation industry, Zhejiang Province Highway Transportation Company has been increasing the prices of oil and various materials in recent years, and various costs have increased accordingly. In order to maintain transportation and inject funds, the company has appropriately increased passenger ticket prices for each road section, calculated at 2 jiao of national currency per kilometer. For example, from Jinhua to Lishui, the entire journey is 119 kilometers, so the fare is 23.8 yuan, to Longquan 27.4 yuan, and to Songyang 13.4 yuan. It is said that it has been reported for record and will be implemented on the 16th of this month.

### Four President Ships Requisitioned; Only a Transfer in Nature; If Service Is Discontinued, Prepared to Dispatch Ships to Replace the Route; Far East Cargo Company Decided to Maintain

The American Shipping Commission has requisitioned four ships of the American President Lines, including the Coolidge, Cleveland, Taft, and Pierce. The company has now confirmed this, but because the company has other ships that have not been requisitioned to join and supplement them, shipping has not been affected in the slightest. However, it may no longer carry passengers in the future and only transport cargo. However, this measure is only a possibility and there is no definite news yet.

Old Ships to Replace Requisitioned Four Ships

According to ship company sources, there is no confirmed news on when the Coolidge and other four ships will be requisitioned as auxiliary ships by the Department of the Army. However, the requisition of the four ships will not affect the voyages between the Pacific and the Far East, as the company's old Jackson and Mette President ships (transliterated) can be redeployed.

Requisitioned in Name Only, Still Sailing to the Far East

As for the Coolidge, Taft, Pierce, and Cleveland, although they have been requisitioned in name, they will still sail to the Far East in the future, or even come to Shanghai. The only change after being requisitioned is that their actions will no longer belong to the company but will be dispatched by the U.S. Department of the Army. According to company sources, the company has three other President ships that sail to the Atlantic Ocean and have long been allocated to the U.S. Department of the Army. Two of them, including the former Shanghai evacuation ship Montcalm and others.

Cleveland to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow

The Cleveland President is one of the ships that has been requisitioned. The ship is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Manila, Hong Kong at 7 a.m. tomorrow and dock at buoys 12 and 13. In addition to a large number of mails, it also carries a large amount of cargo. It will be berthed in Shanghai for 16 hours and will set sail from Kobe, Honolulu, and San Francisco for the United States at 11 a.m. on the 13th. The last small passenger ship to pick up passengers will depart from the Xin Guan Pier at 9:30 a.m. on the 13th. The company has not confirmed whether the ship will be requisitioned on this trip. The Coolidge President is the company's largest mail ship, with a deadweight of over 22,000 tons. It is currently stranded in Manila and will return to Shanghai on the 18th of this month, stay overnight, and then return to the United States. In addition, the Adam President will join the world route and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on its maiden voyage on July 24.

### Another Labor-Management Conflict at the Mifeng Factory; Workers Injured

The labor unrest at the Mifeng (Bee Trademark) Woolen Mill at 400 Poyang Road, which began last month, has continued to a stalemate to this day, nearing a month. Both labor and management have maintained a strong stance. Unfortunate incidents have continued to occur during the strike period. On the morning of the 4th of this month, the labor side once again negotiated with the management, but unfortunately, there was a wide divergence of opinions, and a conflict broke out between the two sides. As a result, several workers were beaten and injured. Subsequently, personnel from the Political Department of the Municipal Council were dispatched to mediate, and both sides showed mutual concessions. Currently, the labor side has sent six representatives to negotiate with the management within days to jointly find a solution.

### Premium Disappears, Instead of a Discount; Remittance System Succeeds; Many Legal Tender Depositors Apply for Remittance Transfers; Collateral is Reliable, Circulation Amount Increases

Since the Shanghai Bankers Association implemented the new remittance system, various banks and firms have provided collateral to the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks to obtain new remittances. The total amount of new remittances is stipulated to be 50 million National Currency. The Foreign Banks Association of Shanghai, as well as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank, have jointly formed a Remittance Preparation Inspection Committee to conduct monthly public inspections to ensure credibility. This new remittance fund with reliable collateral is gladly accepted by Chinese and foreign pawnbrokers and merchants, and has now been widely circulated in the Shanghai market.

Strictly Prohibit Remittance Discounts

Remittance instruments are not allowed to be cashed or used to purchase foreign exchange, and are only allowed to be transferred between firms in Shanghai. Consequently, speculative money exchange shops exploited the fact that remittances could not be cashed to create a new practice of remittance discounts. Although the Ministry of Finance ordered a ban, it was ultimately due to Shanghai's unique background that the serious problem attracted public attention. It was also believed that in order to prevent capital flight, it was necessary to ban remittance discounts. For example, in July of the 28th year (1939), the highest discount was 280 yuan per thousand yuan. On May 2, of the 29th year, the discount was 220 yuan. The Joint Reserve Committee of Banks, entrusted by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Third Bank, attempted to stabilize remittance discounts, but due to various reasons, stopped the effort from July 1, of the 28th year.

New System Effective, Premium Eliminated

Since the new remittance system has been improved, with reliable collateral for remittance funds widely circulating in the Shanghai market, both Chinese and foreign holders of the bills have gradually gained considerable understanding of this new system. Remittance instruments are gradually being used in the same way as cash transfers, and remittance discounts have gradually decreased, disappearing without a trace and reaching par, a world apart from the previous need for a discount of 180 yuan per thousand yuan. Those who previously purchased and stored foreign exchange and foreign currency are now selling them and converting them into legal tender. At the same time, the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks has reduced interest rates and set limits for transfer account holders. However, the higher the amount of remittance circulation.

Collateral is Reliable, and Instead of a Discount, a Premium is Obtained

The new remittance has reliable collateral. According to the inspection report of the Remittance Preparation Inspection Committee, as of the end of April this year, the approved remittance amount for firms was 169,971,600 National Currency, and the total value of collateral deposited by various firms for interbank remittances was 46,777,893 National Currency, including 151,200 yuan in goods, 6,981,180 yuan in securities, and 39,545,513 yuan in real estate. The 23rd inspection is scheduled to be held on June 20. The credibility of remittance instruments is becoming increasingly strong, and a new phenomenon of remittance premiums has now emerged.

### Watchman's Gun Robbed

A watchman (number 142) at 1243 Lane, Gordon Road, was on duty at the lane entrance at 9:40 last night when suddenly five thugs rushed to the watchman, threatened him with guns, and dragged him into the lane. They robbed him of his service pistol (gun number 221) and six bullets. The bandits fled in different directions without a trace.

### Abnormal Weather, Disease Epidemic, Plum Season Approaching

Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been hot, with prolonged sunshine and no rain. The climate is arid and dry, which not only affects agricultural production but also harms the health of residents. Recently, infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, measles, and tuberculosis have been extremely rampant. Smallpox and scarlet fever have also been detected. Fortunately, there are no cholera cases. In total, 1,059 Chinese and 16 foreigners died in the Public Concession last week, and 275 Chinese and 3 foreigners died in the French Concession, totaling 1,334 Chinese and 19 foreigners, for a total of 1,353 deaths. From yesterday evening, drizzle has been falling and the wind is strong. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, yesterday's showers were a signal of the start of the plum season. The weather in the Yangtze River basin is turning overcast, and as far as the North China Plain and Tianjin, the sky is also hazy.

### Stolen Funds from Post Office Robbery Not Yet Returned to Post Office; Six Suspects from Savings and Remittance Bureau Interrogated; Family Visits Rejected by Japanese

After the Shanghai Postal Administration robbery was solved, the Japanese side has not yet returned the recovered stolen funds to the Post Office for inventory. What is the intention? This has gradually caused anxiety. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the situation below:

Funds Not Returned

According to reliable sources at the Shanghai Postal Administration, although the major robbery of the bureau was quickly solved through the cooperation of the police and the Japanese military police, and the original stolen 2 million yuan (not 2.5 million) was recovered in full, the funds had not been returned to the post office for inventory as of last night.

Six People Not Released

However, the Japanese side has guaranteed that the funds are safe and it is believed that they can be returned by the Japanese side soon. Currently, Okada, the Chief Inspector of the Post Office, is handling the above-mentioned handover, not Kinji Kinichiro, as Kinji Kinichiro is on sick leave. As for the six Savings and Remittance Bureau employees, including Wang Xuchu, who were escorted with the funds, they have not been released.

Visits Refused

According to Datong News Agency, the six people are being held at the old site of the Wing On Silver Company in Hongkou. Family members have asked the bureau to send clothes to the individuals several times, but have been refused by the Japanese side, who have also stated that they will be released soon. However, they are actually still being interrogated. Therefore, it is speculated at the Post Office that the failure to return the stolen funds is related to the interrogation of the six individuals.

### Coal Briquettes Unpopular, Market Price Plunges

After the market price of coal briquettes was illegally raised by various mechanized coal briquette factories, there was a public outcry. There was much external criticism, and there was a unified call for regulation. The authorities of the two concessions also sent personnel to various mechanized coal briquette factories to investigate the cost of manufacturing coal briquettes. According to news from various coal industry associations yesterday, coal briquettes are becoming increasingly difficult to sell, the market is flooded with inventory, and no one is asking about them. Coal merchants are unable to continue to operate actively, and the market is sluggish. Although the factory price is still maintained at 316 yuan per ton, the "black market" price has fallen sharply, from 316 yuan to 290 yuan per ton, and holders of the goods are still planning to lower prices to sell. Although warehouse receipts are still somewhat in demand, there is obviously no one asking about spot goods. 10,000 tons of coal fines are currently being transported to Shanghai and are expected to arrive around the 15th of this month. Most of the 10,000 tons of coal fines are coal dust, so the cost of manufacturing coal briquettes in the future will not only be free from a shortage of raw materials, but the cost will also be significantly reduced.

### Special Tax Decided, Entertainment Venues Raise Prices

The Shanghai Municipal Council, due to a shortage of administrative funds, issued notices to entertainment venues such as theaters and cinemas in late last month, stipulating that a special entertainment tax of 10% would be added from June. At that time, theaters and cinemas, due to rising prices, had huge expenses and it was difficult to maintain operations. If it were implemented, the theaters themselves would only increase ticket prices in order to maintain capital, which would indirectly increase the burden on the audience. Therefore, they jointly petitioned to maintain the status quo, but the result was still not approved by the authorities. In addition, the lower-level staff of the theaters have recently requested an increase in rice subsidies, resulting in an increase in the burden on the theaters themselves. As a last resort, the theaters have jointly raised prices starting today. Yesterday, the Xin Chan, Geng Xin, Da Wu Tai, and Gong Wu Tai jointly announced that, due to the Municipal Council's order to collect a 10% entertainment tax, and because of the high cost of goods and the sharp increase in wages, it is difficult to maintain operations at the original ticket prices. The theaters have decided to revise ticket prices uniformly starting June 11, in order to slightly increase revenue. The matter is unavoidable, and we hope for the understanding of all sectors. (It is understood that the price increase is about 20% on average.)

Cinemas Will Raise Prices in Stages

As for the cinemas, they have also received the same order from the authorities, and their request to maintain the status quo has not been successful. Seeing, in order to maintain their own interests, they have also decided to hold a meeting within days to discuss ways to increase ticket prices. However, the price difference between the first-run and third- and fourth-run cinemas is huge, so it is decided to raise prices in stages at that time. The business of entertainment venues after the price increase will inevitably be somewhat affected.

### The Immortal Painter Ma Mengrong

The Da Xin Art Gallery is exhibiting Yongjia Ma's calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy for five days, starting today. The main works are the posthumous works of Mr. Mengrong. Mengrong and Gongyu were considered to be like the Ji brothers in Yongjia, and were renowned in the art world for their calligraphy, painting, epigraphy, poetry, and prose. Mengrong unfortunately passed away early, and I lost a good friend. Now, ten years have passed in a flash. The grief in the yellow spring, how can it be stopped? However, Mengrong's spirit lives on between heaven and earth, and his name will become more famous over time, which can be attested to. Mengrong has long been proficient in calligraphy, painting, poetry, and prose. He has a particular talent for painting, and he has a deep family background and rich collections. He also has to visit gardens, travel through mountains and rivers, and observe the true phenomena of the universe every day. Whenever he sees strange birds and exotic flowers, he will immediately imitate them with his eyes and fingers, lean on his brush and meditate, and when he is satisfied, he will be overjoyed. Occasionally, he would encounter vendors hawking their goods on the roadside, and he would carefully observe all kinds of scales, vegetables, and so on, seeking the truth of their postures, drawing them in his diary, and then leave. His love for painting is like his life, and his skills are unique, not just relying on talent to browse through drawing manuals. Therefore, his paintings have integrated all the painting methods of ancient and modern times, and he can open up his own path. He is clear about the principles of the law, and his brush transcends the traces of phenomena. He is proficient in all styles, and his flowers, birds, insects, fish, and crabs are especially magical and unique. Works such as "Strange Fish Picture," "Strange Flower Picture," "Strange Bird Picture," and "Crab Not as Good as One Crab" have long been praised by people. Mengrong is not only good at painting, but also good at teaching, and has been a professor of Chinese painting in various universities for many years. Students who have been instructed by him feel that they have gained wonderful insights. Many of his students are famous artists. After Mengrong's death, President Cai Yuanpei sighed and said, "The loss of a great national painter is a small loss, but the loss of a great national painting educator is a great loss." This is indeed true. Now, the Da Xin Art Gallery is holding an exhibition of his posthumous works in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the death of this great artist, accompanied by recent works by Gongyu, Bihuang, Shiqian, and Jingjuan, with profound intentions. The art of China values being able to follow the ancient, and also values being able to create. However, this is not easy to talk about. Those who are not deeply immersed in the ancient, even if they want to create, cannot. Otherwise, it is just a wild fox zen. Mengrong has a very deep foundation in the ancient, and he can also innovate and create his own realm, not having the same face as others. How can he achieve this without the combination of heaven and man? There is no doubt that he is immortal. Generally speaking, people tend to be greedy for ease and fear difficulty, and imitate others for convenience. Therefore, when Deng Shiru came out, everyone in the world was Deng. When He Zizhen came out, no one was not He. There are many who copy others now, but if you want to be immortal, you must have your own creation. (Lang Jingshan)

### How to Study English (II)

— Ye Jingfeng

However, to sum it up, regardless of the goal, near or far, big or small, whether studying at school or self-studying, to study English to a level where it can be applied, one must have a method. Brute force will not achieve the desired purpose, and one will only suffer losses. Carelessness may lead to discouragement or even failure.

What are the ways to study English? There are many. Like the saying in the martial arts world, "Everyone knows the trick, but each has their own unique skill." Those who have achieved some success each have their own insights and methods. I have wandered around and taken many detours on this path of study. Now, I would like to humbly share some of my small experiences in reading and teaching in this corner of the publication, as a gesture of offering a brick to attract jade.

This article intends to examine the three conditions for studying English and some small paths in reading, writing, speaking, and translating.

Three Conditions

First, I believe that studying English should start with setting a goal. With a goal, one can aim directly at it and move forward bravely. In this way, one can avoid detours. In other words, one can identify a straight path without branches and move straight ahead. A straight path can also be said to be a "shortcut." For example, some people only want to be able to cope with English in the future, some use it as a bridge to explore science, some prepare to embark on a literary path, some want to apply it to their profession, and some only regard it as a kind of academic cultivation. All of these are different goals, so it seems that one should take different paths in studying. Those who want to use it as a bridge to science do not need to pursue Shakespeare.

Second, after setting a goal and identifying a straight path, we need to measure this path and divide it into several sections. The first section is of course for basic English training. I believe that being able to complete Reading Book Three and Elementary English Composition, or textbooks of equal level, can be considered the end of basic training. Then, depending on our goal, we need to determine the path and set several more sections, completing them one by one. This does not conflict with our schoolwork and provides great assistance. Why divide it into sections? This is a scientific method. On the one hand, it can boost morale, and on the other hand, it can avoid the drawbacks of being greedy or intermittent. Each section has a corresponding time limit. Imagine how gratified we would be if we reached the specified section within the specified time limit. As for setting goals, it depends on the chosen profession. The issue of dividing the path into sections should be discussed with teachers or experienced individuals. The length of the time limit should preferably be somewhat flexible.

Third, English training methods can be roughly divided into two types. The one that is more commonly used in our country can be called the indirect method, which is the "textbook guidance" method. The other is the direct method, which also has textbooks, but the main focus is on live material training. These two methods each have their own advantages, but I personally believe that the direct method is lively and interesting, and highly efficient, because students are already experimenting and applying what they learn.

### The "Illnesses" of Women

— Qishui

The magnificent seven-story building houses the clinic of a German-trained medical doctor on the third floor, room number three. The registration fee is ten dollars.

The clinic is quite exquisite, with four "suffering" ladies sitting inside.

Mrs. Hua is a famous socialite. She stood up immediately, and after a few words, she knew everyone: one was the concubine of the Jin mansion, the one sitting nicely was the second wife of the Qian comprador, and the plump one was the beloved mistress of Manager Zhang.

Bi: Mrs. Hua, being a socialite, spoke first:

"Mrs. Jin, what 'illness' are you suffering from?"

"Me?" Mrs. Yu sighed: "Alas... I often have 'stomach pain'."

"Oh, when did it start?" Mrs. Jin shook her head: "For many years... The master always wants me to accompany guests, eating and eating, always filling my stomach... Now I sometimes can't swallow even a grain of rice." Then she sighed again.

Mrs. Hua sighed: "Strange illness... Hmm, what's bothering the comprador's wife?" Mrs. Qian touched her arms;

"It's so annoying, my arms are so sore, it hurts when I move."

"Then, how did it come about?" Mrs. Jin quickly asked.

"Well, probably from catching a cold: we play dozens of rounds of cards every night, often until dawn. There are always many partners, including several 'gentlemen', compradors, managers, chiefs, bank directors..."

At this moment, Manager Zhang's wife stamped her high heels:

"Damn it, my 'illness' is the worst... A debt-collecting illness, I've lost a lot of money, and there's no 'income' either..."

The three ladies couldn't help but lean closer.

"You don't know! My Mr. Zhang always gives me three to four thousand dollars a month, specifically for buying face powder. Of course, other things don't count... Naturally, I don't need to buy so much face powder, but it's too wasteful to leave it idle, so I have to 'make use of it'..."

Hearing Mrs. Zhang's reasonable explanation, the three nodded:

"Yes, yes." Manager Zhang's wife was very enthusiastic:

"So I thought: I'll hoard some goods, like daily necessities; and run some 'tables'; ha, I'm not bragging, I've been gambling big or small for years... Also, the Jai Alai field, the dog racing field... Can't forget those either... Alas, like this, you think, isn't it 'worrying', 'using your brain'?..."

The three ladies said in unison: "Worrying, worrying..."

Mrs. Zhang suddenly slapped the sofa armrest with her hand: "The problem came, and afterwards I always felt dizzy and lightheaded..."

"Then, eat more tonics..."

Mrs. Zhang frowned: "Oh, talking about tonics, don't even mention it, white fungus, ginseng, bird's nest, deer antler... Western things: vitamins, cod liver oil, preparations, enzymes, what haven't I eaten..."

"Mrs. Hua, what about you?" Unfortunately,

She ran into Hua, the socialite, who also sighed: "Alas, the ladies are all 'lucky', how can I compare to my 'miserable life'..."

The three ladies were surprised: "Mrs. Hua, what do you mean?"

Mrs. Hua sighed repeatedly: "Every night, I don't know how many 'parties' I have to 'dance' at, some nights I have the energy to stay up all night... You little know that if I'm not 'popular', every night is like 'glutinous rice balls', if I'm 'popular', great, the 'problem' comes, now my legs are always sore, but every night I have to 'buck up', dance, dance..."

The three ladies suddenly fell silent. Suddenly, Mrs. Jin squeaked: "Mrs. Hua, how did you become 'popular'?"

The socialite pouted, turned her head, and stomped hard on the sofa: "Go ask your 'gentlemen'!"

The door opened.

The nurse poked her head in like a rat: "Doctor X is here."

### Short Seven

— Wang Pei

If you love life, you should cherish time, because time is the element that creates life.

Don't think you have a genius for intelligence. An intelligent person who is arrogant and considers themselves above all others is not as useful as a foolish person who pays attention to everything.

Anger has reasons, but none can have sufficient reason.

(9) A Strange Farmer

Moreover, several of them were notorious rogues in the village. Once they borrowed money, they wanted a second time, and after the second time, they wanted a third time. They simply would not stop until the person who lent them the money begged for mercy. Old Man Wu was anxious, and he repeatedly advised Qiu Haitang several times. But in less than half a year, more than five hundred dollars had gone down the drain.

"As long as you don't lend them money in the future, what are five or six hundred dollars?" After listening to his uncle's advice, he initially didn't mind at all, and instead smiled faintly.

But after a year, he couldn't help but start to worry.

First, the facts proved to him that the sentence "as long as you don't lend them money in the future" was absolutely impossible, at least for those few rogues. Once they almost fought with him at the village entrance. Second, he saw Mei Bao growing up day by day, with such a beautiful face and such intelligence. Even if she changed into the clothes of a village child, she still had a very noticeable difference compared to her brother's children. Qiu Haitang deeply felt that Mei should have her own future; in such a remote and poor place, her life would definitely be buried. For the sake of his daughter's happiness, he decided to find a suitable opportunity to move elsewhere and cultivate her well. In this way, he gradually felt that his savings were not enough.

In addition to the two fixed deposit books - six thousand yuan - that Yu Kun and Zhao Si brought back from Beijing, there was originally more than two thousand yuan in cash; but for moving, for buying things, for making friends with relatives, for repeatedly supplementing the household expenses in the past year or so due to insufficient expenses, for... the cash hidden in the bottom of the box was almost less than a thousand.

So he began to worry:

"Old man, you are also very bored here. Besides, I am already completely useless, and you will definitely not have a good life following me." (129)

### "Matchmaker" "Deceive" "Unlucky"

— Gu Ying

It seems I heard people say that being a "matchmaker" is a "good deal"; when people live together in harmony for a hundred years, adding children and grandchildren, they take the matchmaker's money and eat the matchmaker's wine. This is a really convenient way to be a matchmaker.

Because of this, Old Lady Qian also became a matchmaker with great style.

However, there is a "trick" to being a matchmaker, and that is the word "deceive". Of course, Old Lady Qian is an "experienced" person, and she cannot escape this. She understands "nine out of ten matchmakers deceive", so she actually deceived the man's family and deceived the woman's family, accomplishing Old Lady Qian's match.

Old Lady Qian was full of joy and had nowhere to vent it, so she told everyone she met, boasting about her "skill as a matchmaker", but in fact, she was mostly happy to eat the matchmaker's wine and take the matchmaker's money.

She always believed that marriage based on parents' orders and matchmakers' words was the "right way", and she always looked down on other ways, no matter how they were described.

However, just a few weeks before the wedding, Old Lady Qian's "unluckiness" came.

The daughter of the woman's family was an only child, naturally the "apple of her eye". Originally, they were preparing to recruit a satisfactory son-in-law, but Old Lady Qian made a few turns and dispelled the idea of a golden turtle, but the "conditions" were also harsh. They wanted this and wanted that, and the gold and silver items they took over were either disliked for being too light or the style was too old; as for the banknotes, they wanted so much and so much, which made Old Lady Qian frown.

The groom of the man's family was her own nephew, so naturally she was familiar with everything in his family. Coincidentally, his mother was also a stubborn person, and she jumped up and said no, saying that raising a son was not afraid of not having a wife, and she was not looking for treasure! Ha, Old Lady Qian was stunned when she heard this! Haha, with such a conflict between the two families, she was afraid that she would not be able to "deceive" them. But Old Lady Qian couldn't let go of this "face", and the matchmaker had to eat eighteen meals", which meant running to the man's family and running to the woman's family, and it was not easy to count the ten or eight times of wasting time and causing trouble.

However, afterwards, Old Lady Qian became so "busy" that she began to complain, complaining that being a matchmaker was like "having bad luck".

It turned out that the young "couple" asked Old Lady Qian to introduce them to each other, to meet, to watch a movie, to walk in the park. Oh, Old Lady Qian thought this was extremely absurd. She remembered that when she left her "boudoir", she didn't dare to mention half a word about the road. So, based on this, she gave them a serious lesson, but unexpectedly, she, she actually raised a "protest", saying that she was over the "legal age" and could "independently" marry. This made Old Lady Qian feel confused. She guessed that the past and the present were just like this... Then, Old Lady Qian understood even less. He, she dared to directly cancel the marriage, thinking that without her consent, everything was invalid... Otherwise, she would not hesitate to hire a lawyer and publish it in the newspaper... How could Old Lady Qian not be annoyed? She never thought that the younger generation would also disobey her matchmaker, and even say that they would resolve it with the law, which was really "rebellious".

At the same time, the woman's family "inquired" that the groom was doing a "hopeless" job, earning less than ten "hands" a month... How could that be! It would be best for her daughter to marry someone with "style", who would ride in a car, live in a foreign house, and have a crowd of maids and elder sisters, so that she would not be wronged. Therefore, her daughter in her twenties was still not married, and that was for this point. It was okay to delay her daughter's youth, but if she "couldn't marry a good man in her whole life", wouldn't that "be a loss instead"!

So the woman's parents dragged Old Lady Qian and said, how could you deceive when you are a matchmaker! Old Lady Qian thought to herself that it was not good. She had just been displeased and was about to "break the engagement", what kind of dignity was that?

But Old Lady Qian still wanted to deceive them. She thought she would go to the man's family to take a walk, so to speak, to pull out the seedlings, but unexpectedly, the man's first sentence was also to break the engagement. It turned out that they had also inquired that the lady had been to the "mainland" and had extensive social contacts outside, and they didn't know how many boyfriends she had, so this marriage was by no means worthy, and they hurriedly asked Old Lady Qian to return the tea gift and betrothal money. Old Lady Qian thought that this statement was indeed quite reasonable, that the bride had originally "eloped" once and was often not at home, so it was better to deceive them with this match...

Alas, Old Lady Qian was "busy" for more than half a year, lying and deceiving for the sake of the match... but only got "unlucky".

### Is Dad Stingy?

— Xinghua

My sister said: Dad is really stingy.

Because, she wanted Dad to buy hair oil. Dad said: Now everything is expensive, rice costs hundreds of dollars a stone! There's no extra money to buy hair oil, just use water to moisten your hair!

My brother also said: Dad is really stingy.

Because, he wanted Dad to buy a suit. Dad also said: Now prices are rising, rice costs hundreds of dollars a stone! There's no extra money to make a suit. Just wear a long gown!

×××

The doctor said to my sister: "Your body is very weak, it's best to take more tonics, especially cod liver oil."

Dad went to the pharmacy and bought a gallon. He said, "This oil costs ten dollars a pound! For your health, I am willing to buy it. Eat as much as you like, and I will buy more when you finish it."

The school organized a winter clothing donation, and Dad was asked to donate money. Dad immediately pledged a donation. He said, "We should love everyone. Those who have strength should contribute their strength, and those who have money should contribute their money!"

Is Dad stingy? I asked.

The Arts

### Notes After Watching New Domestic Films

— Sudi

Here, I would like to sincerely and frankly introduce to the readers of the arts community the four new films I have recently seen, namely: Huguang's "The Beauty Trap", Xinguang's "Broken Heart Flower", Jincheng's "Red Tears in Iron Windows", and Guolian's "Jiangnan Little Swordsman".

Anyone who has read "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" will probably remember the story of Liu Bei's marriage proposal, which turned out to be true. "The Beauty Trap" is based on this story. Wang Cilong directed and Wang Yuanlong starred. The two Wangs came together, and since they are brothers, this film can be called a "brotherly work". Regarding the allocation of actors, Wang Yuanlong played Zhao Yun, Lu Ming played Princess Shangxiang, Wang Naidong played Liu Bei, and Li Jingbo played Sun Quan. Except for replacing Hu Die with Lu Ming, this lineup is almost the original cast of "Peacock Flies Southeast". Wang Yuanlong's acting skills can be described as "handsome with surplus, but lacking expression". Every move seems "forced" and not "natural". Wang Naidong put on ancient costumes, with a strange head and strange face, and his appearance was ugly, and he still couldn't get rid of the style of modern clothes. Li Jingbo played well, and since he is a drama actor, his stage experience is naturally quite rich. Lu Ming's acting skills have made amazing progress, but unfortunately there are too few scenes, so it is not easy to please the audience.

"Broken Heart Flower" is a tragedy. According to the director Wang Yin, it is his most proud masterpiece of the year. The plot is very bitter and can indeed earn people's tears. [Name] is a "typical little girl" who shares the same fame as Zhou Xuan in the film industry. It is of course most appropriate for her to play a little maid in this play. Since "Xi Shi", this star has been separated from the audience for quite a long time. Her performance in this film reveals true emotions everywhere, which is really commendable. This should be due to "Wang Yin's good guidance". Liu Qiong plays a passionate young man who is full of courage. His acting skills seem to have improved a lot compared to before. Others such as Wang Xianzai, Han Langen, and Yin Xiucen are also competent.

"Red Tears in Iron Windows" is also a tragedy. Because there are many flashbacks in the script, there are many obstacles in the performance. Chen Yanyan plays Xiao Feng, and the role matches her, but unfortunately, she did not perform the sadness enough to be "touching". Mei Xi's expression has new progress. As for the section of Hong Jingling and Zhang Zhizhi's play, Wu Yonggang inserted realistic themes and handled them with a lively technique, writing about two hooligans who linger on the "dream of gold" when they are dying, scolding the current era, and even better, scolding the current parasites.

"Jiangnan Little Swordsman" is a martial arts film. There are not a few magical scenes in it, such as the Five Elements Divine Sword, riding the clouds and driving the fog, and flying sand and rocks. The story is about the battle between the Kunlun School and the Kongtong School, which is completely meaningless. Chen Juanjuan's sword dance performance is still worth watching. Juanjuan is quite capable of acting, but letting her play the "little swordsman" and play that kind of "boring" story is neither suitable for her personality nor can it develop her talent. This point is worthy of attention from those of us who are enthusiastic about promoting domestic films.

### The Silver Flower Record

— Wen

The Shanghai Chinese and Western Cinema Association was formally announced on the 6th of this month, and eight committee members were elected on the spot. The Chinese committee members are Shi Tingpan of Huguang, Xia Lianliang of Xinguang, and Liu Zhonghao of Jincheng. The Western committee members are Bertolan of Asian Film Company, Sha'er of Guanglu, etc.

After "Silent Night", Hanhai, a newcomer from Guohua, will star in "Blood and Tears of Mandarin Ducks". It is also heard that the female lead of the film will still be the golden-voiced Zhou Xuan.

Chen Yunshang's mother suddenly took a turn for the worse, and yesterday she was transferred to Hongqiao Sanatorium for treatment. Chen's new film "Wild Rose" is eagerly awaiting its premiere at Huguang, so yesterday it continued filming. After "Ill-fated Flower", Guanghua Company's new work, "Mandarin Ducks of the Same Fate", shot its maiden shot yesterday, with the female lead still being Gu Lanjun. After Yu Ling's "Flowers Splashed with Tears", the new script has been named "Fallen Flowers", and once it is completed in Hong Kong, it will be sent to Shanghai and still filmed by Jin Xing. It is heard that the whole play still takes the life of a dancer as its theme.

Fang Peilin's new work after "Silver Spear Bandit" has been named "White Orchid". The female lead has been decided as Gu Lanjun, and the male lead will still be Zhang Huichong, but it has not yet been decided.

Yesterday, Jin Xinmin, the manager of Minhua Company, hosted a banquet at the Jingu Hotel to thank the staff of "Children of the World" and invited reporters and all the staff and actors.

### Gu Lanjun's New Work After Childbirth

— Baiding

Since Gu Lanjun starred in "Diao Chan" and established her foundation in the silver screen, her position has not wavered in the three years since then. This, of course, can be attributed to the conclusion in "The times create heroes." She is a brave, bold, and persevering new woman, and this can be fully confirmed from her life process of combining with Li Ying resolutely. After she combined with Li Yang, she gave birth to a child on the twelfth of last month, and now it has been exactly one month.

In the past month, she has been restoring her pre-natal healthy physique, so she is preparing to restart the work of this film. In addition to her and Li Ying's self-funded production of "Mandarin Ducks of the Same Fate", she will also star in Yue Feng's new work "Beauty Island" for Guolian.

"Beauty Island" is full of the tropical style of the South Pacific Islands, which is in line with her personality, and the male lead has also been internally decided to be Liu Qiong.

Brief News (1) Today (11th), Qin Ticket Jin Shaogang married Miss Jun at Lake Society, and there was also a hall meeting drama, and all the actors were famous tickets from the sea. The dramas were mostly Tan Pai's famous dramas. The groom personally played the piano, which was also interesting. (2) The sixth grand summer performance of the Green Field Theater Troupe is "Soul Returns to Hate Heaven", written and directed by Ge Ge. The location is planned to be at the Lyceum Theater.

### Sketches of Opera Figures

(12) Jiang Miaoxiang

Among the current male opera performers, besides those who have passed away, Cheng Jixian is the most prominent still active. However, Cheng Jixian rarely appears on stage due to his age and retirement. After Cheng, Jiang Miaoxiang is considered the most senior and respected. Jiang originally studied Qingyi (female roles), but switched to Xiaosheng (young male roles) after his voice changed. He is skilled in various roles such as Pheasant-Feathered General, Fan-Bearing Scholar, and Poor Scholar. Mei Lanfang values his talent and always includes Miaoxiang in his troupes. In historical dramas like "Dream of the Red Chamber," Miaoxiang always plays the role of Baoyu. He excels in plays such as "Gathering Heroes," where he plays Zhou Yu, "Thirteen Sisters," where he plays An Ji, "Flying Tiger Mountain," where he plays Li Cunxiao, and "Yue Family Village," where he plays Yue Yun. His reading of the indictment in "The Trial of Yutangchun" is particularly praised. Most modern performers tend to omit the "reading of the indictment." In recent years, due to his advanced age, his appearance is no longer as refined and elegant as it once was, and his gestures are not as graceful and romantic. He is also skilled in painting, with his peony paintings being the best. He often signs his paintings with "Hui Bo," which is Miaoxiang's courtesy name. He has a daughter who married Tan Fuying. The year before last, he married Feng Jinfu, the daughter of Feng Huilin, as his second wife. Huilin was Jiang's mentor, and Jinfu was a top student at the Beiping Opera School. Their marriage as mentor and student was a celebrated event. He possesses a scholarly air and resembles a Confucian scholar rather than an opera performer. (Next Saturday: Zhang Junqiu)

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter Ten: Gongsun Sword Qi Begins (Part One)

The two walked and talked, descending Weifeng Mountain and arriving at the city gate. Soldiers were checking those entering the city at the gate. One of the soldiers recognized Xu Jing and immediately allowed him to enter. The two hurried to Wang Yongtai's house, where Wang Yongtai was already waiting. After greeting each other, they went to the study to sit down. Wang Yongtai then told them that He Ji's lewdness and immorality were unforgivable, and he had forced her to commit suicide by hanging. He also had Sang Yiqing buried alive in the backyard by his servants, ending this sinful relationship. He said, "This is their own doing, and you cannot blame me for being cruel. I cannot forgive them because of my Buddhist beliefs. Moreover, there will inevitably be a fierce battle here sooner or later, and I cannot avoid breaking my vows." After speaking, he sighed deeply. Xu Jing then asked if General Zhou was well last night. Wang Yongtai said, "Last night, I received a report from my family that the yamen had captured two assassins, one of whom died on the spot due to serious injuries. This morning, I escorted the assassin to the yamen to comfort General Zhou and briefly reported the matter of capturing the assassin at my house last night. General Zhou was very surprised and eager to meet Mr. Liu, instructing me to bring him to meet him when he entered the city. Therefore, I invite you two to have lunch at my house, and then I will lead Mr. Liu and my worthy nephew to pay respects to General Zhou." Liu Yinying said, "I am a rustic person living in the mountains and have not had the opportunity to meet high officials. Therefore, I dare not visit General Zhou. Please, old hero, make excuses for me." Wang Yongtai said, "Mr. Liu, please do not be so polite. With your outstanding appearance, graceful manners, and elegant conversation, you are truly a contemporary talent, no less than my worthy nephew Xu. General Zhou repeatedly instructed me to introduce you to him. No matter what, I cannot allow you to leave. General Zhou would laugh at my incompetence for not being able to keep even one person. Moreover, General Zhou is eager for talented individuals and treats people with respect. He will surely be pleased to meet you. If you refuse to go, you will truly be disrespecting me." Xu Jing also persuaded him. Liu Yinying reluctantly agreed to a meeting. Thus, Wang Yongtai prepared a feast for the two, with many delicacies. Xu Jing was very happy and toasted Wang Yongtai several times. Liu Yinying only drank half a cup, taking only a small sip, and refused to drink more.

Quick Sketches of Movie Stars

### (2) Greta Garbo

This immortal and mysterious lady is now changing her past style. When she was fifteen, she worked in an apartment. Then her father died suddenly and she became a model in a hat store to earn a living. One day, a progressive Swedish director discovered her, gave her a supporting role, and told her to change her cumbersome name. Her first starring film was The Atonement of Gösta Berling, which won the Nobel Prize. At the age of sixteen, she left her hometown of Sweden for the United States to make films for MGM. She is five feet six inches tall with golden hair and sapphire-like eyes.
