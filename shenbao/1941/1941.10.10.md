### Celebrating National Day with Glorious War Achievements: Hubei-Henan Chinese Forces Launch Major Counteroffensive; Battle Line Extends 200 Miles from Yichang to Xinyang; Chinese Air Force Flies to Henan Frontline to Assist in Battle, Achieves Great Results

Chongqing, Intense battles are raging in the Yichang area. Chinese forces have retaken all strongholds surrounding Yichang, stormed the city multiple times, and engaged in fierce street fighting with Japanese troops. They are continuing to search for the enemy. Japanese military transportation on the Jingyi Avenue and the Hanyi Road has been cut off. Forces in Shashi also briefly entered the city. A general offensive is now underway by Chinese forces in western Hubei. (Ninth Telegram)

Chongqing, The war in central Henan is unfolding fiercely. Chinese forces are counterattacking Zhengzhou from all directions, completing the encirclement of the city area and controlling all areas surrounding Zhengzhou. Japanese forces are being forced to adopt a defensive posture and are on the verge of collapse. The situation in Zhongmu and Rongze remains unchanged. It is reported that the Chinese Air Force flew to the front yesterday to assist in the battle, achieving significant results. There was artillery fire on both banks of the Yellow River yesterday. Chinese artillery units between Luoyang and Tongguan inflicted heavy damage on Japanese forces moving on the north bank. (Ninth Telegram)

Chongqing, The National Government issued a public statement at midnight, announcing that Chinese forces had captured five key strongholds outside Yichang. Other important strongholds are also surrounded by Chinese forces. One of the five captured points, Dongshan Zui (transliteration), is less than one-third of a mile from Yichang. The statement also mentioned that recent actions by Chinese forces in northern Hubei and southern Henan have cut off Japanese transportation lines on the Pinghan Railway and the Hanyi-Xiangyang Highway in several places. The statement did not mention Chinese forces entering Yichang, but it is widely believed that they have, presumably because Dongshan Zui can remotely control Yichang city and the airport in the middle. The statement also did not mention Mo Ji Shan (transliteration), a strategically important mountain across the river from Yichang, the possession of which is decisive for controlling the Yichang area. The statement was carefully worded and did not use the term "counteroffensive," but still stated that the original purpose of the Yichang and other area campaigns was to reduce Japanese pressure on northern Hunan. Although the authorities refused to reveal how the Yichang battle would likely develop, the public here is very excited and hopes to recover the westernmost point occupied by Japanese forces in the Yangtze River area within days. The editorial of the Shishi Xinbao (Times News) was titled "Good News on the Eve of National Day," stating that the Yichang battle is very meaningful because it is a counteroffensive by Chinese forces in one area. The Chinese forces initially adopted a strategy of trading space for time in the first phase of the war. They are no longer doing so and are determined to defend their existing territory at all costs, while also striving to recover key strongholds in preparation for a general counteroffensive when the time is right. There has been no change in the battle situation on the Zhengzhou front. Japanese forces claim that they are consolidating their recently acquired territory. According to news from Changsha, most of the Japanese forces in northern Hunan have retreated north across the Xinqiang River, and Chinese forces are in hot pursuit. (Ninth Reuters Telegram)

Laohekou, The Sino-Japanese War has lasted for more than four years. Chinese troops are advancing on both the north and south banks of the Yangtze River in central China on the eve of launching another major offensive. By the time this telegram is published, it is feared that the 200-mile front line will be in contact with Japanese forces. This front line stretches from Yichang to Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway. According to what the reporter has learned, there are two motivations for the Chinese forces' offensive. First, to repel the Japanese offensive in Henan, as the Japanese forces advancing west from Zhengzhou on the south bank of the Yellow River are threatening important areas of free China. Second, to provide assistance to the Soviet Union. Chinese military circles believe that the Soviet Union will be attacked by Japanese forces. If the offensive is successful, Chinese forces hope to recover Yichang, Shashi, and even Hankou. However, the possibility of recovering Wuhan is currently not considered great. Due to military secrets, the reporter cannot report on China's exact plans. However, based on the reporter's observations of the Sino-Japanese War for more than four years, this Chinese military plan is the largest in scale. Chinese forces, under the command of Generals Chen Cheng and Li Zongren, are launching a concentrated offensive from dozens of different directions against the weakened Japanese forces in the Hubei-Henan-Anhui-Jiangxi region. Other senior Chongqing officials are arriving here with battle plans. Mechanized units that China has never used before, as well as small but powerful Chinese artillery units, will be concentrated at several points, rather than dispersed everywhere, so that they can inflict absolute damage on the weakest Japanese forces. The Chinese forces currently undertaking the offensive are specially selected troops who have been well-trained and are experienced. They were hidden behind less capable troops, preparing to wait for an opportunity to counterattack. Now the counteroffensive is about to begin. Famous field commanders who achieved great victories in the Battle of Taierzhuang, such as Generals Tang Enbo and Sun Lianzhong, will actively command on the vast front. In this area, there are 150,000 guerrillas, who are now being utilized as much as possible. They have 100,000 guns, some of which they brought themselves, and some of which were brought by defecting soldiers. Chinese forces are now planning to contact a large number of defecting soldiers and use them as internal support. These defecting soldiers have secretly informed the Chinese military headquarters that they will take advantage of the opportunity to defect when this decisive offensive develops to a considerable extent. On the eve of this great battle, the Chinese military headquarters feels deeply excited and full of hope. The cheerful mood of the officers is unprecedented. They all gladly believe that the time has come to launch the counterattack that the military has been waiting for for so long. A senior military officer told the reporter, "Please go to the front line and witness the victory." The reporter is accepting this invitation and will rush to the front line immediately. (Ninth International News Agency Telegram)

Luoyang, Japanese forces invading Zhengzhou, Zhongmu, Rongze, and other places have been fiercely resisted by Chinese forces, and the Japanese advance has been thwarted. Many Japanese supplies and ammunition have been burned. Japanese forces who had infiltrated Zhengzhou have been attacked by Chinese forces from three sides for several days, resulting in many casualties. Currently, the Japanese are trapped in the city and are actively building fortifications. Japanese forces who detoured to Fuxi Village northwest of Guangwu on the morning of the 6th were defeated by Chinese forces and fled north to Zhanggou. They were surrounded and annihilated by Chinese forces from all sides. The Japanese forces who infiltrated the Da Yuan Village area of Rongze County have been besieged by Chinese forces for several days, resulting in many casualties. Chinese forces are currently besieging them separately. (Eighth Telegram)

Reasons for Japanese Failure in Invading Changsha

Changsha, The Japanese suffered another defeat in their invasion of Changsha. They not only falsely claimed that they were voluntarily retreating but also fabricated rumors to slander General Xue Yue of the Chinese army, seeking to vent their anger. The Central News Agency reporter maintained close contact with General Xue from the beginning to the end of this decisive battle and learned that the Chinese army had maintained a superior position throughout the battle. The Japanese were expected to repeat history. However, the reasons for their fatal defeat are as follows: (1) On September 25, Yang Hancheng's troops captured a Japanese carrier pigeon on the Miluo River, carrying a desperate plea from the Chief of Staff of the Japanese 2nd Division to Lieutenant General Liu of the Japanese 11th Army, revealing the Japanese army's plight of running out of ammunition and supplies. (2) The battle map of the Japanese Kitano Division Commander was seized near his body, after he was killed at Li Bridge, allowing the Chinese army to learn his battle plan. (3) The Chinese Air Force bombed and destroyed a large amount of Japanese military supplies and reinforcements in Jinjing, Huanghuashi, Fulimpuxian City, and other places, causing the Japanese to lose hope of resupply and their soldiers to lose their fighting spirit. (4) The strong Chinese corps relentlessly pursued the retreating Japanese forces. The Chinese army also adhered to its predetermined plan to firmly defend Changsha, causing the Japanese to be attacked from both front and rear, suffering heavy casualties. These four reasons led to the Japanese army's predicament, forcing them to retreat. Claiming that they were voluntarily withdrawing is simply self-deception. General Xue Yue remained optimistic throughout the battle. Amidst the flurry of military orders, he maintained a composed demeanor. He also planned to personally meet with foreign journalists from the United States and the Soviet Union on the front line in the near future to refute Japanese rumors with his own testimony.

Reporter Inspects War Achievements in Changsha

Changsha, After the fighting in the northeastern suburbs of Changsha subsided, the reporter crossed the river to inspect the office in the former eastern suburbs. It was the residence of incumbent legislator Ling Zhang. A few tiles on the roof were damaged, but the exterior was intact. The neighboring Jimin Hospital was occupied by Japanese forces who had infiltrated the eastern suburbs. Based on the traces, it seemed to be a large contingent. All the equipment inside the hospital was destroyed. Many Japanese soldiers even trespassed into the reporter's house. Unfortunately, the reporter had already vacated the house, leaving the Japanese greatly disappointed. The residence of the postmaster, according to Jimin Hospital's Japanese Anchuanda Tianer Shaozuo, were captured by Chinese forces. The reporter then went to inspect Xiangya Road and Beida Road in the northern suburbs. All the places occupied by the Japanese forces were damaged. The Xiangya Catholic Church and Desheng Hospital, which were established by foreigners in Changsha, sheltered many patients and refugees, and were searched by the Japanese more than three times. In the urban area, some Japanese plainclothes teams infiltrated. If the military destroyed the long windows of the business county office, which had already been closed. During the tense battle in Changsha, those in the northeastern suburbs who did not have time to escape were searched by the Japanese soldiers, and many have not yet returned. In this battle, the Chinese army fought bloody battles with the Japanese forces in the northeastern suburbs, and the people provided a lot of assistance. For example, they personally delivered food to the troops, and the boatmen in the river competed to serve as helmsmen, advancing one after another, and finally succeeded in crossing the river. These heroic deeds are particularly touching. With the Japanese troops cleared from the suburbs, the citizens saw the light of day again and were overjoyed. (Eighth Telegram)

Changsha, In this Battle of Changsha, the brave Chinese Air Force dispatched frequently, assisting the army and achieving remarkable achievements. The reporter recently inspected the war zone outside Changsha, 40 li east of Changsha in Huanghuashi, and discovered many traces of mass cremations of Japanese soldiers killed by Chinese aircraft. More than 5,000 Japanese soldiers and horses gathered in the rice fields in Ma Qian and Gelimpu, 100 li north of Changsha, were bombed by Chinese aircraft on the 3rd, and according to the bloodstains in the fields, at least half were killed or injured. At the same time, Chinese aircraft dropped bombs on Japanese boats gathered in the river in the Guiyi area of the New Market, and the hit rate was also very surprising. There are still many damaged hulls and debris clogging the river, hindering the flow of water. (Eighth Telegram)

Editorial

### Commemorating the 30th Anniversary of National Day

Today is the Double Tenth Festival, commemorating the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. The ancients said that thirty years is a generation, and Confucius said, "At thirty, I stood firm." By this standard, the Republic of China, which has been painstakingly created, has now gone through the process of infancy and childhood and entered the vigorous stage of adulthood.

Thirty years is a long time, and the past thirty years have been eventful. Many events that broke historical records have occurred during this period. In China, it was a time of transformation from the old to the new. During this period, autocratic emperors and feudal regimes were overthrown, long-standing customs, cultures, and thoughts were reformed, and unprecedented political unification was achieved. Most importantly, an unprecedented all-out war was launched, and the entire nation struggled for independence and freedom with the power. During this period, many major changes came one after another. The suffering of the country and the people was countless. On the other hand, it was precisely because of these migrations and trials that the light of new life was bred on the ruins of thousands of years of corruption, which coincided with the ancient saying that "misfortune makes a nation prosper."

Although the Xinhai Revolution established a democratic system, it only transferred power from the Manchu Qing royal family to the feudal warlords. As far as the task of the revolution is concerned, it was no different from dying halfway and failing to complete its work. Therefore, it was followed by the Second Revolution of 1913, the Northern Expedition and Unification from 1926 to 1928, and this all-out war. Although their forms were different, their meanings were consistent, in order to complete the independence, freedom, and equality of the Chinese nation. This war is the final key to the survival of China. Whether the achievements of the Chinese people's struggle and efforts over the past 20 years and the great achievements of the revolutionary movement can continue to be maintained and carried forward depends entirely on the outcome of this war. Over the past four years, it has experienced countless dangers and difficulties. Relying on the full development of the national spirit and the unanimous obedience of the military and civilians, it has overcome the most dangerous difficulties. Especially in the past year, most of the objective developments have been in line with the wishes of the world: The international anti-aggression front is strengthening and expanding, and the democratic countries' support for China is also rapidly and actively underway. In recent days, good news has been frequently reported from northern Hunan and western Hubei, embellishing this National Day, heralding the victory and light for the struggle to build the country. This is what all righteous people in the world feel happy and fortunate about.

However, the great cause of nation-building is complex and multifaceted. In the past, China was limited by special domestic and foreign circumstances, resulting in backwardness in all aspects, which was insufficient to compete with the world's great powers. Therefore, in the four years of war, it had to exchange heavy sacrifices for the expected victory. At present, the military situation is already under control, and military equipment is being supplied from the United States under the Lend-Lease Act. However, at a time when aggression is rampant and the scourge of war is spreading, the issue of national defense is the top priority when it comes to nation-building. In recent years, the Nazi aggression has been invincible, but only this attack on the Soviet Union has been repeatedly resisted. Even if it exerted all its strength, it was unable to achieve its desires. This cannot but be attributed to the great achievements of the Soviet Union's five-year plan in intensifying construction and enriching national defense. Modern national defense is mainly composed of two major factors: science and economics, and economic development is proportional to scientific achievements. China has endless manpower and abundant resources, but everything is so stagnant. In the final analysis, the lack of scientific development is the main reason. During the four years of war, both military and economic aspects have made great progress, but scientific research related to national defense still lacks in achievement and is not enough to meet actual needs. There are many reasons for this, but this shortcoming must be quickly remedied.

With the evolution of the international situation, China has increasingly increased its weight in the global situation. The war that China is engaged in, in addition to the safety and well-being of the nation itself, bears the heavy responsibility of defending justice and curbing violence for the whole world. Therefore, it is even more necessary to be strong and vigorous and to strengthen its strength so that its internal strength can match its historical age of being strong and adult. For itself and for the world, this is precisely the urgent task that must be devoted to at this moment.

Chongqing, In an essay published by Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi on the eve of National Day, he said that freedom is still the power that gives life, and China has seen the dawn of new life. China is strengthened by the assistance of various democratic countries, but on the other hand, the democratic countries are also strengthened by China's heroic struggle.

### US Announces Large-Scale Aircraft Assistance to China by Autumn of Next Year; Chinese Officials Express Warm Welcome; Hope US Will Deliver and Apply Them as Soon as Possible

United Press, Washington, 8th - Senior officials, while justifying subsidies for the Lend-Lease Act in the House Appropriations Subcommittee today, stated that China can obtain fighter aircraft worth US$133 million under the Lend-Lease Act by the autumn of 1942. The Philippines currently has the highest priority in obtaining war equipment "because of the unstable situation in the Pacific." General Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, stated that when discussing the current US arms production to aid Britain, the Philippine army could obtain the highest priority for war materials. Colonel Mayer of the Department of the Army told the subcommittee that it was recommended to allocate US$133 million worth of aircraft to China under the Lend-Lease Act, which could be shipped to China in the late autumn of 1942. Currently, the Lend-Lease aid being shipped to China, the Dutch East Indies, and Britain has exceeded US$700 million. Director Patterson of the Department of the Army told the subcommittee that the Department of the Army planned to allocate US$4 million to purchase machinery and equipment for transportation to China, "so that small arms factories could be established in the interior of China. This measure would allow the Chinese government to produce some arms in China and be maintained by the equipment supplied by the United States for its mechanization." He said that two-thirds of this fund would be used for machinery for arms factories, and the remaining one-third could be used for motorcycle supply stations. General Land, Chairman of the Shipping Commission, reported that the cost of transporting Lend-Lease goods to China for the period ending May 31, 1942, would be US$24 million. He said that the committee was currently trying to find ships to travel between Yangon and New Delhi to transport these materials. He said that it was believed that there would be 80 voyages by May 31, 1942, each costing US$300,000. In addition, Democratic Congressman Famouth of Bin Province, while debating in the House of Representatives, stated that he hoped that a considerable portion of the new funds would be given to China, "they are fighting for the war for democracy with other armies in the world," and he praised Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's leadership in China's heroic struggle.

United Press, Chongqing, 9th - Chinese officials welcomed Washington's announcement today that it would supply China with aircraft worth US$132 million in the autumn of 1942 and pointed out that this was another favorable development in the definite trend of closer cooperation between China and the United States. Chinese officials also pointed out that a large number of aircraft were urgently needed here for the general counteroffensive and therefore should be delivered as soon as possible. The official Central Daily News published the statement of the new Lend-Lease budget bill in large headlines, with the headline "The United States Decides to Expand Aid to China, Supplying Us with a Large Number of Aircraft and Machines."

### New Funding for Lend-Lease Act May Pass House Today

United Press International, Washington, 9th—A $5,985,000,000 appropriation for the Lend-Lease Act, with the strong support of the executive branch and the approval of the House Appropriations Committee, was submitted to the House for a vote yesterday. House leaders stated that the bill is expected to pass no later than this Friday.

Reuters, Washington, 9th—During the House Appropriations Committee's review of the $5,985,000,000 Lend-Lease Act funding, officials testified, citing evidence that the United States believes the Far East situation still poses a threat. The committee subsequently passed the funding with a statement saying that US munitions production has not yet reached the point where it can guarantee the defeat of the Axis powers. The fact that the United States has sold military supplies worth $500 million to the Dutch East Indies and that the War Department has prioritized the US military stationed in the Philippines in its supply priorities shows that the United States still considers the Far East situation pressing. The committee reported to the House that all new major funding could be fully allocated by March 1, 1942, and that the delivery of various goods could be completed by the end of June 1943. The Lend-Lease program began last spring with $700 million in funding. Initial production was inevitably slow, but there was no misuse of funds, and the new funding was essential. The United States must achieve an advantage in munitions to ensure the defeat of the Axis and to arm the countries resisting the Axis. Production has not yet reached this point, so war production must be accelerated until the country's military supplies flow out like a tide. The United States' first line of defense is the use of the Lend-Lease Act. The Lend-Lease funding is divided into ten categories according to the President's recommendations, the largest of which is agricultural and industrial products, totaling $1,875,000,000. Next is ordnance and reserves, totaling $2,190,000,000. Aircraft needs account for $685,000,000. The report revealed the following points: (1) Agriculture Secretary Wickard plans to use $1,000,000,000 over the next six months to provide for a quarter of the British people's needs; (2) Officials handling the Lend-Lease Act are not satisfied with the relatively small amount of supplies being provided to countries resisting the Axis and hope that the export of supplies will increase significantly during the initial preparatory period; (3) For every dollar of defense goods exported, another seventy cents' worth of other goods are attached; (4) War Secretary Stimson believes that the world crisis has not diminished in the slightest and is even more acute than before; (5) Army Chief of Staff General Marshall believes that the Lend-Lease program should not be hindered or delayed in any way, because previous delays by Britain have led to its current predicament and endangered its national survival; (6) The US Army has no plans for reductions; (7) Officials have repeatedly stated that it would be extremely dangerous not to extend the benefits of the Lend-Lease program to the Soviet Union.

### US Manufacturing of War Materiel Shows Great Progress in Six Months

The report also stated that US factory capacity currently used for the manufacture of war materiel accounts for 20 percent, and it is expected that this will reach 50 percent by June 1943. Overall, great progress has been made in six months since the use of $7,000,000,000 in funding. The production of these goods is certainly not something that can be achieved overnight. Since the outbreak of the war, exports to the British Empire and Egypt have totaled over $4,500,000,000. This is for goods purchased and paid for by Britain. As for aid to the Soviet Union, if the President believes there is a need to allocate Lend-Lease funding to aid the Soviet Union but does not have the power to do so, nothing would be more disheartening to the Soviet people as they resist the Axis invasion. This funding bill contains a new clause allowing those who have difficulty paying cash to make payments in installments rather than paying in advance, as is currently the case with the Dutch East Indies. However, the balance must be paid when the loan is settled. Chairman Land of the Maritime Commission told the committee that it is estimated that more than 320 freighters will be needed to transport Lend-Lease goods to British Red Sea ports, China, and ports in the Near East. Although a quarter of the world's ships have been lost, the United States will be able to build 12 to 14 million tons of new ships in 1942-43. He estimated that the Red Sea and Near East routes would require 135 freighters and the Atlantic 185 freighters, and that maintaining shipping to the Red Sea and Near East from the beginning of November 1941 to the end of May 1942 would cost $64 million. As for China, it is estimated that from now until the end of next May, there will be 80 voyages, costing $24 million, on the route from New York to Rangoon.

United Press International, Washington, 9th—Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark announced yesterday that the US Navy Department has not used naval aircraft to aid Britain under the Lend-Lease Act, but stated that a large number of naval aircraft will be provided to Britain from January 1st. After that, aid to Britain in the form of aircraft "will be rapid." He made this statement in a closed-door report to the House Appropriations Committee, testifying in favor of the $5,985,000,000 supplementary Lend-Lease bill. Later, this statement was released. Treasury Department Director Mack testified in court that of the $562,070,000 supplemental Defense Aid Act administered by the Treasury Department, $512,070,000 was for aid to Britain and $50,000,000 was for aid to China. He stated, "This amount was determined after several consultations with representatives of the Chinese and British governments." Mack stated that the main purchases are industrial raw materials. So far, items purchased outside the United States include a small amount of lead from Burma for aid to China, as well as a small amount of high-grade aviation gasoline from the Far East for aid to China. When asked about raw silk imports, he stated that the United States currently has no imports of Japanese silk. Admiral Stark's testimony followed announcements by several senior officials that China will receive military aircraft worth $133,000,000 in the fall of 1942 under the Lend-Lease Act. Stark estimates that 75 percent of the military supplies currently being manufactured by the United States for Britain could be allocated to the US armed forces if necessary. He said that some munitions, such as torpedoes, cannot be used by the United States, but 3-inch and 5-inch cannons can be used by the US Navy. Republican Representative Case of South Dakota said, "Congress has repeatedly decided to prevent the use of large sums of $2 million or $3 million for improvements to Guam and the Philippines, but this $40,000,000 blank check may be used for purposes that exceed the strengthening of the defenses of Guam and the Philippines." General Moller replied that the United States is giving close consideration to these issues.

### Ambassador Gu's Speech in England Thanks Allied Nations for Assistance

Reuters, London, 9th—Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Dr. Gu Weijun delivered a speech in London yesterday, expressing his gratitude to Britain and the United States for their assistance in China's four years of war against Japan. The Ambassador cited the United States' provision of assistance to China under the Lend-Lease Act, the dispatch of a US military mission, the dispatch of economic experts from Britain and the United States to China, the dispatch of economic missions from Australia and Canada to Chongqing, New Zealand's significant sympathy for China, and the special convenience provided by India and Burma for China's transportation, to demonstrate the spirit of assistance and cooperation shown by democratic countries in their relations with China. The Ambassador mentioned the fact that China and the Soviet Union are fighting aggression in similar circumstances, stating that it is important to note that China and the Soviet Union are motivated by the same ideal, as both countries are fighting for "the freedom and justice of the world." Asian aggressors have not only disturbed China for four years, but have also occupied Vietnam and are now reaching out to other countries in the Far East. The defending forces of China and the Soviet Union are currently simultaneously resisting the two most powerful war machines in the world, which are intent on conquest and control of other countries. The struggles of the two countries may seem unrelated on the surface, but in reality, they are invisibly linked. China and the Soviet Union will be regarded as two true bulwarks resisting on land, just as Britain, the United States, and the defenders of the seven seas are in the common struggle against aggression. China and the Soviet Union not only enjoy the sympathy and goodwill of the vast majority of the world's people, but have also benefited from the active assistance of the two Anglo-Saxon democratic nations. There is no doubt that the common goal of freedom sought by the freedom-loving Britain, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union will achieve final victory. I am speaking here in Britain, the bastion of modern democracy, and witnessing the ever-increasing war efforts of people of all levels here. The Ambassador also praised the vigorous ability of British Prime Minister Churchill, saying that the Prime Minister not only symbolizes the will to victory, but also inspires the public to intensify their efforts.

United Press International, New York, 9th—Lewis B. Schwellenbach, chairman of the United China Relief Committee, announced yesterday that the amount raised in New York in the current aid to China movement has exceeded US$600,000.

### US, British, and Dutch Agreement to Stop Oil Exports to Japan

Reuters, Washington, 9th—According to responsible sources, the US, British, and Dutch governments have all agreed to completely stop supplying oil to Japan. Since July 26th, the only oil shipped from the United States to Japan was $25,000 worth of oil carried by the Japanese ship Tatsuta Maru to provide fuel for the ship. Trade between the US and Japan has been technically possible since July 26th, but officials here say that trade has virtually stopped entirely, as the entry and exit of Japanese goods or funds is not permitted without special permission from the US Treasury Department. Officials also say that any oil that Japan may be able to find will come from areas outside the jurisdiction of the US, British, and Dutch governments. The US, British, and Dutch governments formed an agreement to stop oil exports to Japan after freezing Japanese assets within their borders on July 26th.

### Duff Cooper Flies to Simla

Reuters, Calcutta, 9th—British Minister of Information Duff Cooper, the British War Cabinet's representative to the Far East, arrived here from Rangoon yesterday and flew to Simla today to meet Indian Viceroy Lord Linlithgow. Cooper told Reuters reporters that in the current situation, it would be unwise to comment on the situation in the Far East. His mission is not related to India. His decision to come to India was to pay his respects to the Viceroy. His mission is related to the Far East, including Australia, New Zealand, and Burma. His stay in India will be quite short, and he regrets that he was unable to gain a concrete idea of India's great efforts in the war. However, he was deeply impressed by the Indian army, as he had seen the Indian army working very well in Malaya. After meeting with the Viceroy, Cooper will meet with the Governor of Bengal.

### US-Japan Exploratory Talks to Continue

Both Sides Unwilling to Create New Crisis; Germany May Join War on Axis Side Soon

United Press International, Washington, 9th—Well-informed sources expect that US-Japan diplomatic negotiations will have new developments after Nomura's arrival in Washington. The reason for the suspension of US-Japan negotiations is the United States' insistence on restoring China to its status in 1937. The attitudes of the US and Japan are both very clear, so Nomura's arrival here may not bring about obvious changes in the situation. However, the new report that Nomura brings from Japan will allow Japanese Ambassador Nomura to further study how to approach this issue with a new plan. Well-informed sources believe that Japan will not take a tough new step unless radical factions rise. Negotiations will continue on an exploratory basis. The general opinion of non-diplomatic but reliable government officials seems to be a minimum expectation, that is, that Japan's actions will not occur recently. The main reason is that the military and diplomatic situations in other regions of the world have not yet been decided. The most well-informed sources believe that Japan will not take action while the Battle of Moscow has not been decided and the Soviet Union is still showing strong resistance. The current temporary state of peace may continue, because neither the Japanese government nor the United States wants to be involved in the war, or at least does not want to worsen the current relationship. Both countries apparently recognize that any further action will result in a new crisis and create a serious situation for both countries. Japan currently seems busy dealing with China and is struggling to consider international developments and will wait for the outcome of the situation before engaging in new adventures. The United States is also watching Europe, but any action by Japan will quickly create a new situation in the Pacific, which neither country wants.

United Press International, New York, 9th—The New York Min Sheng Jiang Jie Bao recently reported that the US and Japan are engaging in negotiations to reach a limited agreement to ease current US-Japan relations, allowing the United States to focus on the Atlantic and allowing Japan to alleviate the pressure caused by trade restrictions and asset freezes.

Reuters, Washington, 9th—It is rumored here that Germany is still pressing Tokyo to join the war on the Axis side. News received here from Europe clearly indicates that Berlin is certain that Japan will declare war on the US within sixty days, and Germany is making every effort to instigate this move, because once a US-Japan war breaks out, the US army and navy will not allow US supplies to be transported across the Atlantic to Britain. People here feel that Japan is currently in a difficult position financially, economically, and militarily, and may not be willing to be a cat's paw for Germany. However, German-Japanese relations remain close, which seems to be proven by reliable reports that German and Japanese secret agents within the United States have established full cooperation. As for the talks between the US and Japan, there has obviously been no progress.

United Press International, Washington, 9th—Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that he had not heard of rumors that Taylor and the Pope had discussed peace between China and Japan. The US's position on US-Japan negotiations remains unchanged. He refused to comment on the possibility of new developments with Nomura's return to Washington from Tokyo. He had not heard of any new developments regarding the possibility of resuming US-Japan navigation.

### Representatives of Free Nations Should Hold Meeting Soon to Discuss Post-War World Trade Issues; British Ambassador to US Delivers Speech

Reuters, New York, 9th—British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax stated while speaking at a conference of the National Foreign Trade Council that the issue of building world trade must be started now and carried out by Britain and the United States together with various free nations. Representatives of all these countries should hold a meeting as soon as possible. The British Ambassador also stated that three documents of historical importance have been published in the short period of six months: first, the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration, now known as the Atlantic Charter; second, the central government's declaration on goods under the Lend-Lease Act; and third, the resolution passed by the British government and its autonomous governments, as well as the leaders of European countries currently in London and the Soviet Union. US Under Secretary of State Welles spoke next, stating that the post-war era will be as dangerous as the present. If the United States does not prepare in advance and adopts a wait-and-see policy until peace comes, it will lead to disaster. The greatest goal of the American people at present is the final and complete defeat of Hitlerism. Welles then read a letter from President Wilson, which stated that one of the eternal responsibilities is to strive to place international trade on the basis of fair transactions, equal treatment, and mutual benefits. British Prime Minister Churchill also sent a telegram to the meeting, saying that he was very sorry that the British side was unable to actively participate in the discussions of the conference as desired due to matters in other areas.

### Germany and Turkey Sign Economic Agreement

Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 9th—German-Turkish economic negotiations, which have been going on for several weeks, were completed last night. The purpose was to conclude a new barter agreement and a method for clearing goods. The new agreement will be signed at noon today. The German side is Ambassador Papen and Dr. Klodius, the leader of the German economic delegation. The Turkish side is the chief representative Menemencioglu.

### Germany and Bulgaria Hold Economic Agreement

Haitong News Agency, Sofia, 9th—Economic negotiations between Germany and Bulgaria on barter are proceeding very smoothly. The effective period of the agreement is from October 1 of this year to April 1 of next year. Various issues such as the export of Bulgarian agricultural products to Germany and the export of German goods to Bulgaria have been resolved. What is currently being discussed is the determination of the price of Bulgarian tobacco and alcohol to be paid. The agreement can be negotiated by the end of this week.

### US House of Representatives Approves Proposal to Allow Armed Merchant Ships

Reuters, Washington, 9th—The House of Representatives will submit a proposal today to allow the arming of American merchant ships. Congressional leaders stated yesterday after reopening a meeting with the President at the White House that they agreed to submit the merchant ship arming bill after the President sent a message to Congress advocating amending the Neutrality Act. According to those who participated in the White House meeting, this bill could be passed by the House of Representatives before the end of next week. However, well-informed sources said that President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Lend-Lease Program Coordinator Hopkins all hope that Congress will eventually amend current laws to allow American ships to sail to ports in belligerent countries or war zones. It is said that Hopkins, who is the most vocal advocate for arming merchant ships and free sailing, expressed disappointment with the decision of yesterday's meeting. One meeting attendee told reporters that if the arming of merchant ships is passed by a majority in the House of Representatives, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee may consider a far-reaching plan to lift restrictions on merchant ship operations. President Roosevelt is scheduled to send a message to Congress today requesting that the Neutrality Act be amended. Senate Majority Leader Barkley told reporters that he could not predict the content of this message. The President has already expressed his desire to arm merchant ships and allow merchant ships to sail to ports in belligerent countries, but he cannot comment on it.

### Talks on the European War (85): The Soviet Rear and Front Lines

Mr. and Mrs. Erskine Caldwell, the famous American writers, visited Chongqing this spring and then went to the Soviet Union for inspection. This article is Caldwell's report four weeks after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. It was originally published in the American "Life" pictorial weekly. The translation is as follows:

The signing of the Allied Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom on July 12 gave people a sincere feeling for the first time, which is to say: the Soviet Union, which has always pursued a go-it-alone policy, is now inextricably linked with a large part of the outside world. Now, Moscow has sincerely accepted the British Empire as its ally, both in terms of combat strategy and practical action. This cannot but be said to be a profound key to the international situation.

In the first four weeks of the German-Soviet war, not a single bomb fell on Moscow. A calm atmosphere still permeated the city. Every house and every building were meticulously organized to cope with the sudden appearance of the German army. Even a single person, if he or she was in a hurry or had suspicious features, would be intercepted on the way. Moscow residents have almost become part of the defense force, not much different from the Red Army. If German paratroopers landed in Moscow, they would have only a slim chance of survival.

The entire people hold a belief that victory is certain. Among the people I spoke with, there were no defeatists. They all have an undeniable belief in the final victory.

At noon on June 22, I was somewhere on the Black Sea coast when I heard Molotov announce the war against Germany on the radio. I saw crowds of listeners silently staring at the loudspeakers in the streets, gazing at the loudspeakers with a look of disbelief. No one threw their hats in the air that day. No one wanted to fight.

Three days later, the whole country was fully prepared for war. Men left to join the army or receive training, and women immediately came out to take over the work of these men. They took on transportation on the streets, engaged in harvesting on farms, managed machinery in factories, and even had to lay rails in transportation. In short, they took over everything that men did.

In the first week after the outbreak of the war, I took a train for a 1,500-mile journey, passing through Ukraine to the industrial area of the Don River basin, and north to central Soviet Union. Although military transportation on every railway line was extremely crowded, ordinary passenger and freight trains were still able to run according to wartime schedules. I did not see a blocked railway trunk line throughout the journey.

The Soviet Union's development of charcoal-powered cars, transport vehicles, and tractors is extremely advanced, which may become a factor determining the final outcome of the war. I visited a tractor factory and witnessed a steady stream of tractors coming off the production line.

The Soviet Union does not seem to be lacking in gasoline. The main purpose of limiting consumption is only to prevent waste in preparation for emergencies. In recent weeks, I have traveled by car on the roads from Moscow to the outside world many times. The traffic has been much faster than before the war.

The authorities ordered all residents of Moscow to hand in their household radios during the war. Although a few people expressed dissatisfaction, most people obeyed the order without complaint. Many apartments and residences originally had shortwave radios that could receive foreign broadcasts, but now they have been converted to longwave radios to receive broadcasts from the national radio station only. After this method was implemented, the national broadcasting programs were unified, that is, there was only one official program. Almost every square, park, and open space has loudspeakers broadcasting important news and reports.

The people's respect and belief in the Red Army is like worshipping heroes. Red Army officers and soldiers who have made meritorious service in battle are often called "Heroes of the Soviet Union" and awarded the "Order of Lenin" or the "Order of the Red Banner." These medals are made of red enamel, the large ones are two inches wide and three inches long, and are hung on the lapel. The number of supporters of these Soviet heroes can be compared to Hollywood stars in the United States. Some are even called "double heroes of the Soviet Union."

Wartime Moscow newspapers are filled with reports of guerrilla warfare behind the German lines. Novel guerrilla tactics have now become the subject of street talk in Moscow.

The most exciting sight in Moscow at this time is those "people's soldiers." The history of the people's army began in the era of the Napoleonic Wars in 1812. They are organized from able-bodied men between the ages of eighteen and fifty who have not been drafted into the army or have not yet been mobilized to join the Red Army. Their task is to assist the Red Army, defend the rear of major cities, and, if necessary, also go to the front line to fight. These plainclothes soldiers pass through the streets in teams, day and night, often singing loudly as they go.

The curfew is from midnight to four o'clock in the morning. During this time, the whole city is like a vast desert. There is no light anywhere, only the faint light leaking from the headlights of cars and a traffic signal held by a militiaman. During the curfew, night watchmen sit on the steps in front of their doors or in chairs. Two to five night watchmen can be found guarding the door of every house in the city. They often walk to the sidewalk to check the passers-by's passes. One night, I walked past eight residential areas and was questioned as many as twelve times.

Moscow's nightlife has almost become a thing of the past. Famous hotels such as the Moscow Hotel, the Metropol Hotel, and the National Hotel continue to provide dancing music, but with the exception of a few young people, the general public is becoming increasingly disgusted with it.

### German Troops Drive in a Wedge-Shaped Incursion to Encroach on Moscow; Soviets Admit Orel Has Fallen; Timoshenko's Troops Fiercely Resist German Army

Reuter, London, 9th - German troops launched a fierce attack yesterday in an attempt to encircle the Soviet army led by General Timoshenko, who is defending Moscow. London sources said that the scope of the German offensive was extremely large. Responsible sources claimed that German troops had driven in a wedge-shaped incursion on both sides of Timoshenko's Soviet army in an attempt to encircle it. Therefore, it seemed that the Soviet army on that route had retreated quite far from Smolensk. If it has not retreated yet, it will be necessary to retreat in order to save the Soviet army around Smolensk. The German side has announced that it has occupied Mariupol and Berdiansk. London has not yet confirmed this. If it is true, and if the German army can maintain its front line from Zaporozhye to Mariupol, then the Soviet army, which has recently launched a counter-offensive from the northeast towards the Perekop Isthmus, will have to break into Crimea in order to escape encirclement. Recent reports indicate that Zaporozhye is still in the hands of the Soviet army, and there is no reliable evidence that the German army has reached the city. However, the German army may have cut off the Soviet army's rear lines of communication in Crimea.

Reuter, London, 9th - The Soviet army led by General Timoshenko is currently resisting the fierce offensive of the German army in Vyazma (140 miles west of Moscow) and Bryansk (230 miles southwest of Moscow) for a week. The fierce battles in these two places are still ongoing. The Soviet side has admitted that Orel, an important railway junction southeast of Bryansk, has fallen after fierce fighting. According to the latest news, the German side is now fighting desperately with a large amount of manpower and material resources in an attempt to break through the Soviet army's front line and reach Moscow, and its losses have been very heavy. The German military command announced that "several Soviet armies have been encircled in the Vyazma area and are being annihilated." Undoubtedly, the war situation is quite serious at present, but Timoshenko's troops may have prepared a counter-offensive. Regarding the situation on the southern front, the German side announced that its mechanized units have attacked south from Dnepropetrovsk and joined forces with the German army advancing along the coast of the Sea of Azov. A Berlin spokesman said that the German front line is now only 120 miles from Moscow, and the Nazi vanguard is even closer to the city. Continuous encirclement battles are currently being conducted in the Vyazma area, with the intention of encircling and annihilating the last Soviet army that still has sufficient combat strength. The Soviet communique stated that the Soviet air force continued to achieve victories, shooting down six German aircraft around Moscow yesterday. Soviet bombers have also contributed to curbing the German advance on Moscow. Thirty German aircraft were destroyed around Smolensk, and several enemy transport convoys and ground aircraft were heavily damaged by bombing. Regarding the situation in Ukraine, the German side announced last night that it had made successful attacks, occupied the famous city of Zaporozhye, and advanced south to the coast of the Sea of Azov. However, this statement has not been confirmed. Moreover, the German army's offensive against Crimea, Odessa, and Leningrad has not only been blocked, but has also been met with a fierce Soviet counter-offensive.

Associated Press, Berlin, 9th - The German High Command issued a special communique from the Fuhrer's headquarters yesterday, declaring that the German army's attack along the coast of the Sea of Azov, between Melitopol and Mariupol, has cut off six to seven Soviet divisions, which will soon be annihilated. Reuter, London, 9th - According to the latest news, the German war machine is currently driving a large number of troops forward slowly in a large-scale offensive towards Moscow. At present, there is no sign of a halt or slackening in this offensive. The German side is currently adding several fresh divisions to the battle to attack the Soviet Union's strongly defended positions. As a result of the German offensive in Vyazma and Orel, the Soviet side admitted the loss last night, and it seems that a large number of Soviet troops may be encircled in the central sector. According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the German offensive in the Vyazma area has not been curbed. The German advance is due to the use of a large number of troops, tanks, and aircraft in small areas on the front line. In the three-day battle near Vyazma, the German army has lost 200 tanks, 500 armored vehicles, and many aircraft. However, the Germans have now gathered many air fleets to assist in the battle. At the same time, Hitler's troops are trying to capture Orel at the greatest speed. The great battle is now continuing. The troops of General Yeremenko's Soviet army have moved from Orel to new positions in good order. A large number of residents have also withdrawn with them. All industrial property of value has been destroyed by the Soviet army before it withdrew from the front. The German encirclement movement in the central sector seems to be larger than previously reported. Moscow briefings said that the battles in Vyazma and Bryansk are fierce, indicating that the German army's initial offensive was focused on the right side of the direct route from Smolensk to Moscow. It is expected that the German army will continue to launch large-scale advances towards Kaluga and Duga, which are the same distance from Moscow as Vyazma, both between 100 and 150 miles, and are connected by good roads and railways. On the southern front, the German side claims to have made surprising progress in Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, but this statement has not yet been confirmed. Mariupol is only 100 miles from Rostov, which is considered more valuable than Moscow, not only as a junction of railways, but also as the end point of the Baku oil pipeline. The German offensive from Poltava towards Kharkov is currently encountering particularly strong resistance. According to the latest news, the troops of General Budyonny are still carrying out effective activities in the southern area. Today's Moscow communique stated that the battles in the Vyazma and Bryansk areas in the central sector and in Mariupol are fierce. News from other Soviet fronts stated that the German offensive around Leningrad and Odessa has not only been curbed, but the Soviet army is constantly counter-attacking. The Soviet naval mouthpiece, Red Fleet News, emphasized that the German forces in the western sector are becoming increasingly weak, and the time when the United Kingdom will have sufficient tanks to completely destroy the German base in the western sector and make the naval situation more favorable to the Allied countries is not far away.

In the Vyazma area, two German battalions were completely wiped out

International News Agency, Moscow, 9th - The Soviet High Command announced that two German battalions, which recently joined the battle in the Vyazma area on the central front, have now been completely wiped out by the Soviet army. It is said that these troops joined the battle on Tuesday evening after the German army advanced about 70 miles towards Vyazma. The High Command also stated that the two Romanian divisions were defeated by the Soviet army in the recent battle of Odessa. The Soviet Supreme State Defense Committee issued a special notice to the Red Army amid the German advance along the road to Moscow, admitting that the war situation is very serious and urging the Soviet army to hold its positions and not to retreat in panic.

Germany claims to be only 200 kilometers from Moscow

Romanian army suffers another disastrous defeat near the Odessa area

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 9th - According to German military sources, after the defeat of the Soviet army in Ukraine, they have now fled to the north of the Sea of Azov. The German army has occupied hundreds of kilometers of land and has now fled to the north of the Sea of Azov. In the central sector, the German army has now reached the city of Gezma, 150 kilometers east of Smolensk. Several Soviet armies have been encircled and are about to be annihilated. It is said that the German army is now only 200 kilometers from Moscow.

TASS, Moscow, 9th - News from the war report on the recent situation in Odessa stated that the 13th and 15th Romanian divisions recently attempted to move again after reorganization and replenishment, with the aim of occupying the outskirts of Odessa. The Red Army preemptively launched an attack from two directions with infantry and marines. The Red Army infantry launched a surprise attack under the cover of heavy artillery and aircraft. The enemy army could not withstand the attack and immediately retreated. By the evening, our army had completely occupied all the key points. The entire 18th Regiment of the 13th Enemy Division was annihilated. At the same time, the Soviet marines attacked the enemy's right flank from Oyumbov. The battle was fierce. The enemy attempted to counter-attack unsuccessfully and abandoned their positions and retreated. As a result of this battle, the 13th and 15th Romanian divisions, which had been replenished, were defeated again. According to Romanian prisoners, many Romanian generals have been executed by military tribunals for this defeat.

The Soviet Union is preparing to move its capital to Stalingrad

Associated Press, London, 9th - Authoritative British sources recently admitted that the situation on the central front in the Soviet Union is extremely serious. It was also heard from Oslo Radio that the Soviet Union, facing the danger of Moscow, has decided to declare Stalingrad as the temporary capital, and the procedures have been prepared. The news of the German invasion of the heart of the Soviet Union and threatening the Red Army has made people here somewhat puzzled. Since the beginning of the first German invasion, British people have believed that the Soviet army might be able to stage a Marne battle story again in the current war. But in fact, Britain has not been able to stage a second Tannenberg, and a second Marne has not been created as a result. Britain apparently did not dare to take risks from the beginning of the German-Soviet war, such as provoking the 22nd German Division in France. The British Air Force has also not attacked for the past seven consecutive nights, probably due to bad weather. The Daily Chronicle, referring to the Red Army's call, said, "This is a call at the most difficult time for our Allied countries and cannot be ignored." But Britain does not have enough supplies to start a real offensive. In other words, the situation in the Soviet Union depends entirely on the Soviet Union. As for what kind of military equipment or assistance for military purposes can be obtained from the United Kingdom and the United States in the next six months, disregarding all the items that the United Kingdom and the United States have promised to give to the Soviet Union, it will not affect the current urgent problem, that is, how to rescue a large number of Red Army troops besieged by Germany, even at the expense of Moscow if necessary, and how to fully delay the German advance so that no more large-scale battles can be determined before winter, and how to preserve its own important fuel supply. British authoritative sources, commenting on the German side's current tactics, said that if the Germans can annihilate the besieged Soviet army, they will definitely reach Moscow. It was also said that the German advanced troops themselves may be besieged, but the attacker has more opportunities to encircle the enemy than the defender. The German offensive has directly threatened one or two routes to the Caucasian oil fields. Orel spans three main railways, especially the Kharkov-Moscow line. If this railway is cut off, the Soviet army's transportation will almost entirely rely on barges across the Caspian Sea to a certain place on the Volga River, and then it will be able to obtain railway transportation again.

The Red Army of Leningrad Recovered an Important Stronghold

Associated Press, Moscow, 9th - According to war reports obtained here yesterday, the German High Command drove armored vehicles into the Soviet army's front line protecting Moscow in the western sector, and attacked on the flanks to protect its main army. However, the Soviet artillery, infantry, and air force resisted with all their might to stop the German offensive towards Moscow. Red Star News said that in order to make up for its heavy losses, the German army has withdrawn mechanized reserve troops from the occupied area to the front line, but the Red Army has sufficient weapons to fight them. Red Star News revealed that the battles in the Vyazma and Bryansk areas have continued to be fierce in recent days. Red Star News published news from the southern front, saying that the German army has reinforced the "P" point with a large number of mechanized units, but the people have assisted the Red Army in building anti-tank defenses. The Soviet tank force launched a counter-attack at the same time to stop the enemy's advance. The enemy's attempt to attack on the flanks failed. The newspaper also said that the Soviet army achieved a victory near Leningrad, as the Red Army recovered an important "E" stronghold and opened a road to advance from there.

### Roosevelt's Statement Intends to Aid the Soviet Union - A Letter to Stalin

Reuter, Washington, 9th - The US General Representative to the Moscow Three-Power Conference, Harriman, recently delivered a letter from President Roosevelt to Stalin.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 9th - A semi-official German news agency published last night President Roosevelt's letter to Soviet leader Stalin. The content is as follows: "My dear friend Stalin, this letter will be presented by my friend Harriman, who is our chief representative to the Moscow Conference. Mr. Harriman is very clear about your issues, and I believe he is willing to do his best to make this conference a success. Mr. Hopkins has submitted to me a detailed report on his visit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating the success and satisfaction of this trip. We express our infinite admiration for the heroic deeds of the Soviet army. I will do my best to contribute appropriate material and military equipment to the soldiers fighting on the front lines against Hitler, including the Soviet front. I sincerely pray and believe that as a result of this war, the Soviet army will defeat Hitler and triumph. I guarantee to prepare for you all kinds of war equipment and materials necessary for the soldiers on the front lines, faithfully and forever. Your friend Roosevelt, respectfully."

### Shanghai Celebrates the Double Ten Festival with Enthusiasm, Recalling Historical Revolutionary Events and Deepening Resolve, Promoting the Four Major Movements with Profound Significance, and Sending a Joint Telegram to Chairman Chiang for Respect

Today is the Double Ten Festival, the 30th National Day Anniversary of the Republic of China. All sectors of Shanghai, in addition to hanging flags to celebrate, all agencies, groups, schools, etc. are taking a holiday as usual. At the same time, the consulates of various countries in Shanghai and the agencies in the two concessions are also hanging flags and taking holidays to extend their congratulations. The entire population of the city, recalling the history of the Wuchang Uprising of the revolutionary heroes thirty years ago to overthrow the imperial system, will strengthen their belief in supporting national policies, work hard to move forward, complete the task of national rejuvenation, and promote the cause left by the martyrs. At the same time, they will continue to promote the four major movements of thrift and savings, cold clothing, disaster relief, and donations, and take positive action to make a positive commemoration. All public groups also sent telegrams to the supreme leader and the soldiers at the front to express their respect. The authorities of the two concessions are sparing no effort to maintain security within the boundaries and will implement strict precautions throughout the day today to prevent unscrupulous elements from plotting wrongdoing.

Telegram to Chairman Chiang to Express Respect

Yesterday, all sectors of the people of this city jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang to the leadership of the masses and the planning of all-roundness. All the soldiers and men were bravely using their lives, and victory was in sight. On the occasion of the National Day of the 30th year of the Republic of China, good news was frequently reported from all fronts, the belief of the people was strengthened, and the world admired it. All the people were cheering. The entire population of the city was enthusiastically responding, and they offered their sincerity and wished the soldiers at the front a victory. They hoped to continue their efforts and complete the great cause of resistance and construction.

Concession Precautions are Extremely Strict

The police authorities of the two concessions, in order to ensure public safety and prevent unfortunate events from occurring, have strengthened their precautions. In addition to increasing the number of detectives and patrols on the busy roads in the past two days, they will also dispatch the Wanguo Volunteer Corps and the American McLean Team and the Italian troops stationed in Shanghai today to conduct strict precautions in their respective defense zones. Wire mesh was set up on the bridges and passages in the border areas of the public concession. The French concession's small teams and armored vehicles were dispatched day and night.

Commemorative Stamps Issued Today

The Shanghai Postal Administration, upon the order of the Kunming General Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in order to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, has ordered the postal administrations in various places to sell commemorative stamps with the words "30th Anniversary of the Founding of the Republic of China and October 10th, 30th Year" added from today.

### Gauze Exports Have Been Prohibited by Customs, and Shipments to Free Zone Ports Have Been Banned. Chinese and Foreign Merchants Are Closely Watching its Development, but Japanese Merchants Can Obtain "Special Approval Rights"

The Jianghai Customs was forced to announce on the 25th of last month that it would prohibit the export of goods from Shanghai to any port or city in the non-occupied areas, but it did not restrict shipments to overseas ports. Unexpectedly, the other day, it issued an announcement in the name of Oyama, a Japanese tax officer, prohibiting the export of cotton yarn and cotton textiles from Shanghai to any port. The trade of third countries with China has once again suffered a severe blow. According to Dazhong News Agency reporters, the Japanese trade control measures are not limited to this. The new regulations on trade control in the occupied areas promulgated by the Japanese Army and Navy authorities on the 27th of last month have been decided to be implemented from today, which is tantamount to placing the trade of third countries with China in a desperate situation, causing the lives of the people in Shanghai and the occupied areas to be more painful. The details are recorded below:

Japanese Tax Officer's Announcement Content

Yesterday, the announcement of Oyama, the Japanese tax officer of the Jianghai Customs, stated that "from" October 8, 1941, the export of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, piece goods, and other cotton products (tariff numbers 192, -197, -201, 206-208, 210-213) (including re-export and transit) is prohibited without special permission. Also, from the same day, even if the customs procedures for the above-mentioned goods have been completed, they shall not be loaded on board without approval. Regarding the latter, when applying for shipment, the above-mentioned goods must be inspected for the export form issued by the Customs Superintendent, otherwise approval will not be granted. Also, even if the loading customs form is stamped by the customs, the above-mentioned goods shall not be loaded or unloaded unless the above-mentioned procedures have been completed."

Prohibited Items

The prohibited cotton goods for export are only generally stipulated in the announcement. The list of various goods is now recorded as follows, totaling 19 cotton thread socks, 193 cotton thread for sewing on spools (no more than 50 yards long), 194 cotton thread not listed, 195 cotton yarn, 196 drawnwork, embroidered work (made of silk and other materials), 197 lace ornaments, 201 cotton cloth, 206 Meters are listed as piece goods, other textiles, 207 cotton blankets and thread blankets, 208 wool blankets, cotton blankets, 20 towels, 211 wool carpets (including wool cotton carpets and rugs), 212 clothing and clothing parts, A. Made of pure silk, B. Made of mixed silk, C. Made of cotton, D. Other 213 Textiles not listed, totaling 14 tariff numbers.

Scope of Prohibition

The place of prohibition for export is not mentioned in the announcement, but its scope is obviously wider than the previous prohibition for export. The previous prohibition was limited to the ports in the free zone, and Hong Kong was not included. Today, the prohibition of cotton goods includes not only the ports in the mountainous areas, but also Hong Kong, Burma, Nanyang, etc. Ports in the occupied areas are also included in the prohibition. Although the announcement points out that those who have obtained special approval are excluded, a Western customs official said that "it is feared that any merchant will have difficulty obtaining a special permit." Therefore, in fact, from yesterday, all cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and cotton textiles were prohibited from export. The afternoon before, the export was approved as usual because the formal announcement had not yet been issued.

Special Approval Rights

According to unconfirmed news, the prohibition of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, etc. for export was initially launched by the Japanese after the British and American freeze on Japanese funds. At that time, there were as many as 15 types of prohibited items, and cotton yarn was one of them. Later, because this move harmed the interests of Japanese merchants, it was immediately lifted. This decision by the customs to stop the import of cotton yarn, etc., and the method of special permits it has set, is feared that only Japanese merchants can enjoy this special approval right. Therefore, the legitimate rights and interests of merchants of other countries will be deprived, and the entire trade of Shanghai will suffer adverse effects due to the various harsh conditions. At this moment, Chinese and Western merchants are paying close attention to the future development.

### The Purpose of This Move: Two Reasons

The excuse for the Japanese tax officer of the customs to implement this move is that the stock of cotton is decreasing day by day. If the export is not prohibited, the yarn factories will be in danger of shutting down. It is said that "only in this way can the Shanghai yarn industry be preserved, the livelihoods of the workers can be maintained, and if foreign cotton can be imported in a steady stream in the future, then the yarn factories will have sufficient raw materials and can be lifted at any time." However, according to widespread rumors from foreigners, the purpose of taking this measure is for two reasons: one is that the Japanese side has authorized strict management measures against the Stabilization Fund as retaliation, and the other is that a certain gang of merchants has failed in speculative speculation, so they have instigated the Japanese side to coerce the customs to take this measure in order to save themselves. Although it is nominally to preserve the yarn industry, it is actually tantamount to placing the yarn industry and the transportation industry in a desperate situation.

There is Still a Lot of Cotton

It is said that there are 56 textile factories in this city, producing about 2,000 pieces of cotton yarn per day, half of which are owned by Chinese and foreign merchants and rely on foreign sales. If this prohibition is in effect for a long time, more than 50 factories will be shut down, which may cause hundreds of thousands of workers to lose their jobs. According to a yarn and cloth merchant, the production of various textile factories this month has been greatly reduced compared to last month due to the lack of raw materials. Therefore, the current stock of cotton yarn in this city has been reduced to 245,000 pieces. In the past, the actual sales were more than 1,000 pieces per day. Judging from the production situation of each factory, it is enough to meet the needs. However, the fact that the yarn price has created an unprecedented high price is undoubtedly caused by speculators. Now that the export route has been cut off, the final result will inevitably be difficult to maintain continued production.

Impact of Transportation

It is also learned that the prosperity of the transportation industry in this city is mostly due to the smooth export of yarn and cloth. Most of the foreign merchant ships sailing to Hong Kong and the Nanyang Islands are loaded with cotton yarn. Although the export tonnage is not huge, the transportation industry in this city will be affected if the ban is implemented. After learning that the customs had prohibited the export of yarn and cloth, the Yihua Company's Guisheng ship immediately unloaded all the yarn and cloth loaded on the ship to Hong Kong and only loaded other goods. It sailed to Hong Kong at 3:00 pm yesterday. Also, the Taikoo Company's Suzhou ship also planned to load cloth and transport it to Tianjin yesterday, but it was also unable to do so.

### The American Aid to China Association Donated 500,000 Yuan, and Dr. Henry Returned to Shanghai to Handle Loan Disbursements

According to Continental News, it was learned yesterday (8th) that the US government has allowed the Church Committee of the American Aid to China Association to remit a huge amount of donations to the Shanghai American Relief Advisory Committee to engage in relief work. According to a telegram from New York, the Church Committee recently decided at a meeting to allocate funds to Shanghai, totaling 506,770 yuan in Chinese currency. At the same time, Dr. Henry, formerly affiliated with the Suzhou Methodist Church, the newly appointed loan disbursement supervisor of the US Advisory Committee, will return to Shanghai. It is expected that the progress of the committee's work will be greatly benefited due to Henry's return.

### Shanghai Suburbs to Build a "Beggar City" with Municipal Agencies to Cooperate and Beggar Shelters to be Discontinued

A reporter learned yesterday that the municipal agencies, the Salvation Army, and the Rotary Club had sent representatives to hold a meeting last week to discuss the plan to establish a beggar district in the Yijiao of Shanghai. According to the plan, a "Beggar City" will be built to give beggars the opportunity to learn skills and teach them the benefits of cleanliness and hygiene, so that they can live a new life. At the same time, schools will be established to accommodate the countless beggar children on the streets, so that they can receive basic education, enjoy the same educational opportunities as ordinary children in the city, and have a day to jump out of the beggar shelters. It is not known who will fund the construction of this beggar city, but according to reliable sources, the municipal agencies of this city will come out to cooperate to promote the success of this plan. According to well-informed sources, after the establishment of the Beggar City, the beggar shelters in this city will be closed. It is also said that in view of the imminent arrival of the cold winter, this plan is being promoted as soon as possible in order to see its success as soon as possible, so that countless beggars can be spared the danger of freezing and starvation.

### An Old Friend Acts as a Parental Figure: Sixty-Eight Year Old Celebrates Marriage with Humorous Anecdotes

— Uncle Gong

The father-in-law is one year older than the groom; the officiant is seven years younger than the groom.

On October 7th, the sixty-eight-year-old Mr. Leng Chan held a wedding ceremony at the Pudong Building to remarry. I was fortunate to be able to attend and observe, thanks to Mr. Mu Shi's suggestion. The details have already been published in this newspaper. Now, I will record some interesting anecdotes from that day as a supplement.

Guests from Afar Gather in the Hall

It is said that Leng Chan's decision to remarry was kept extremely secret, and no relatives or friends were informed. However, many guests attended the ceremony that day, some even from faraway places. Unless these guests all have the abilities of "Sharp Ears" and "Thousand-Mile Eyes," how could so many distinguished guests have arrived?

The Elderly Groom's Embarrassing Demeanor

Leng Chan usually speaks with a pipe in his mouth, stroking his beard, and his attitude is quite indifferent. On this day, his hands hung down, looking extremely embarrassed. He dared not smoke, dared not raise his hands, as if meeting important guests or participating in a grand sacrifice. He seemed truly apprehensive and respectful. The strict authority of Madam Feng made Leng Chan so restrained.

An Old Friend Takes Charge, Empathizing Like a Father

It is said that Leng Chan's remarriage ceremony was entirely prepared by Mr. Jin Ju Lao alone. The depth of this friendship and the concern shown are probably not even surpassed by Mr. Ju Lao's care for his own children. Leng Chan merely bowed and enjoyed the privileges of the groom. I often see advertisements seeking adoptive parents in the newspaper. If they were truly found, I imagine it would be just like this. Leng Chan unexpectedly obtained this without even seeking it himself.

Old Man Wei Is Deaf, Old Man Xin Has a Limp

The two witnesses, Mr. Tang Wei is blind and Mr. Shen Xin has difficulty with his right foot. The blind and the lame, supporting each other onto the stage, was quite amusing. It was perhaps a bit much to ask two elderly men of seventy-eight years to read the marriage certificate word for word without missing a single one. Fortunately, both elders were in high spirits and even made amusing and humorous speeches, causing the audience to burst into laughter, which was truly rare!

Marriage Status is Paramount

Leng Chan and Chen Tao Lao were old friends. Leng Chan is seven years older than Tao Lao. However, on this day, Tao Lao surprisingly stood in the position of officiant at the wedding. Truly, "When the baby in the cradle calls the old woman 'Grandma,' there is nothing anyone can do about it!"

Total Age: Seven Hundred and Seventy

The ages of the figures in this wedding scene are also worth examining. The groom, Leng Chan, is sixty-eight years old. The bride, Feng Kejing, is forty-one years old. The male officiant, Chen Tao Lao, is sixty-one years old. The female officiant, Feng Zi Lao, is sixty years old (only one year older than the groom). The witness, Shen Xin Lao, is seventy-eight years old. Tang Wei Lao is seventy-six years old. The candle holder, Dai Bo Lao, is sixty-nine years old. Gao Chui Lao is sixty-three years old. The introducer, Jin Ju Lao, is sixty-two years old, and Shi Wencai is forty-five years old. The male best man, Hu Cui Lao, is sixty-five years old, and the female best man is forty-one years old. The master of ceremonies is Zhou Shunxuan, forty years old. The total age of all the figures in this wedding scene is seven hundred and seventy-seven years. This kind of wedding ceremony can truly be called a new record in modern marriage history.

### Five Silver Firms Bankrupt Amidst Cotton Yarn Frenzy

Due to the violent surge and fall in cotton yarn prices over the past two days, speculators in this city have suffered losses of several million dollars. According to reliable sources, a certain large silver firm backed by the Hong Kong financial world lost three million dollars in one day. Among the five silver firms that declared bankruptcy today, one is the Dayu Silver Firm on Jiangxi Road, which has published a notice stating that it has declared bankruptcy due to the huge losses caused by the fluctuations in yarn prices.

### Famous News Broadcaster Alcott Broadcasts in San Francisco, Recognizes Shanghai as the Richest International City, Current Prosperity Has Not Yet Reached its Peak

According to the Continental Daily, Alcott, a famous news broadcaster from Shanghai, recently returned to the United States and has arrived in San Francisco. The Baodao Radio Station (call sign KGEI) in that city invited Alcott to broadcast to China during its guest broadcasting program at 9:45 PM Shanghai time last night (4:45 AM Pacific Coast time), lasting approximately ten minutes.

Broadcast Waves Not Very Clear

The broadcast was relayed by the Democratic and Great Beauty Radio Stations in this city. However, due to weather conditions, the sound waves were not very clear. Alcott first said that during his voyage to San Francisco aboard the President Harrison, he encountered repeated storms. Among the passengers was a British naval admiral supervising the construction of the Singapore base.

Singapore Defense Not Afraid of Invasion

He assured him that the defense of Singapore was as solid as a rock. There were also twenty Chinese students on board going to the United States for further studies. At this point, the reporter from Baodao Radio Station asked Alcott to state his opinion on the situation in Shanghai. Alcott then said,

Many Churches and Many Nightclubs

In his opinion, Shanghai has many churches, as well as many nightclubs and gambling dens. Shanghai is one of the most prosperous manufacturing and trade centers in the Far East. American commerce occupies an important part. Shanghai is also one of the most international cities in the world. For this reason, he believes that although there is war everywhere, Shanghai is instead thriving and will soon enjoy an unprecedented prosperity in its history. Alcott concluded by saying that he hoped to return to China after his trip to the United States ended.

### Insurance Broker Scares and Blackmails Neighbor; Detective Waits and Arrests Him

Weng Yaohua, a Chaozhou native residing at 902 Lane 6, Peng Road, is an insurance broker at Sincere and Wing On, known for his upright conduct and trusted by both companies. However, recently, due to financial difficulties, he borrowed 700 yuan from an Indian and could not repay it. He then had a fanciful idea: seeing reports of threatening letters

extorting large sums of money, he also followed in their footsteps, hoping to get lucky. Knowing that his neighbor at No. 5, an elderly Anhui woman named Deng, had a wealthy family, he went to a seal-carving shop on Zhejiang Road, falsely using a name to carve two seals. He wrote a letter and sent it to Deng, extorting 15,000 yuan in legal tender. Between the 4th and 7th of this month, he wrote three letters, asking her to put the money wrapped in newspaper under a utility pole at No. 4 around 8 PM on the 8th, and someone would come to pick it up, otherwise, a bomb would be used

to kill her and she should not regret it. Deng was shocked and reported the matter to the Huisi Police Station. Detective Chief Feng Baishun, Detective Huang Fusen, Detectives Liu Zhaonian, Feng Qi, Yang Yunfeng, etc., disguised themselves as merchants and used newspaper to wrap something that looked like 15,000, on top of which were a few real five-yuan banknotes from the Central Bank. They rushed to the agreed location. Detective Feng put the package next to the utility pole and walked away. The other detectives, including Detective Chief Feng, lay in ambush in all directions, observing the situation. After a while, they saw Weng Yaohua come out of his house and go to

look under the utility pole. Initially, because it had not been placed yet, he went back inside. This happened twice. The third time, he saw the object and went forward to take it, happily entering the stove room of his house. The detectives rushed in and saw him just opening the newspaper. They arrested him and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special Court Police Station. Lawyer Jiang Baolian detailed the case, presenting the three threatening letters and requesting a postponement. Later, Deng's daughter, Baoxian, said that her mother was old and sick and could not come to court to testify, so she would represent her. She questioned the defendant, who confessed that he was confused and resorted to this tactic, begging for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation at a later date.

### Blackmailing Yifeng Rice Store, Gangsters Fighting Among Themselves; Three Criminals Arrested, Old Steward Released

Yifeng Rice Store at 111 Laoxunfu Road in the French Concession suddenly received three threatening letters at the end of last month (September), extorting 40,000 yuan in legal tender. At that time, the boss of the store ignored them after reading them and did not report them to the police station. Unexpectedly, on the 1st of this month, a man in a suit went to the store and asked the staff whether the letter sent the other day had been received. The staff immediately replied that it had been torn up long ago. The man immediately became stern and threatening, using threatening language. Later, the store owner negotiated with him to appease him, and he gave him 1,000 yuan in legal tender. Only then did the man calm down, take the money, and leave. Afterwards, the man's accomplices had a disagreement over the distribution of the money, and one of the accomplices reported it to the French Police Station. At about 5 PM the day before yesterday, three people were arrested in the concession. Their names were Wu Zhiliang, 40 years old, a local, residing at 356 Malang Road; Gu Shukang, 31 years old, from Chongming, residing at 68 Wufengli, Laoxunfu Road; and Ji Xiaojiang, 30 years old, from Chongming, residing at 21 Xichengli, Ximen Road. According to the arrested accomplice, it was the old steward of the store, Yang Chang, who initiated the idea, but when the police station went to arrest him, Yang had already heard the news and fled without a trace.

### French Concession Authorities Refuse Entry to Aigao; Order Issued to Prohibit Aigao Before Landing

According to the Zilin News, after Mr. Aigao, General Tagore's representative in the Japanese-occupied areas of China, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on Tuesday, he was warmly welcomed by various Allied groups in this city. Yesterday, the Free French News Agency issued the following message: Aigao was arrested by a team of Vichy

sailors

on April 5 this year and taken to Saigon, where he was imprisoned for five months. He was released after the intervention of his British and Free French friends. He arrived in Shanghai from Singapore on Tuesday. The Vichy authorities said that Aigao's French citizenship had been stripped. Before Aigao landed in Shanghai, the Vichy Consul General here had ordered Aigao to be banned from entering the French Concession. This move, whether from a moral or spiritual point of view, is almost

beyond comment.

It is still remembered that from the beginning of the European War to the collapse of France, the French Concession authorities did not take steps to expel Germans from the concession or ban their business. At that time, it was said that the legal status of Shanghai made it impossible to adopt this attitude.

### Delong Tobacco Company to Open

Major tobacco merchants in this city have pooled tens of thousands of dollars to set up Delong Tobacco Company at 44 Guangdong Road. The decoration has been completed and the opening is imminent. The company specializes in famous brands of cigarettes, Luzon cigars, Lanzhou water tobacco, various matches, soaps, foreign candles, and other goods. The prices are low. It is said that the official opening will be soon.

### Selling Horse Racing Tickets, Confiscated

The issuance of lottery tickets must be approved by the government. This is clearly stipulated by law. Otherwise, they will be subject to legal sanctions. The Shanghai Racecourse holds two major horse races every year, in spring and autumn. At the same time, a kind of champagne ticket is issued. However, according to the rules of the racecourse, only members are allowed to buy these horse racing tickets. Outsiders are not allowed to openly sell them. However, various lottery shops in Shanghai, because of their high profits, did not hesitate to violate laws and regulations, openly selling them. Although the police station has repeatedly sued the Special Court No. 1 for violations, it has ultimately failed to completely ban sales. Gu Tou Xu Shunqing, Huatan, Yang Guanying, and Tan Sun Dafa from the Laozha Police Station recently discovered that Changxin Ticket Shop at 619 Nanjing Road, Fulai Ticket Shop at 622, and Lao Huiliyuan Ticket Shop at 636 were selling horse racing tickets. The lottery tickets were confiscated, totaling 193 for Fulai, 11 for Lao Huiliyuan, and 159 for Changxin. A subpoena was issued to the owners of the three ticket shops, Hu Qing, Zhang Zi, and Zhang Xilin, to the Special Court No. 1. Yesterday morning, they were summoned to the Criminal Court No. 5 of the Special Court No. 1. Two of them failed to appear, and only Hu appeared. The police station lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted him according to Article 269, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. After questioning by Judge Dai, Hu was fined 150 yuan and the lottery tickets were confiscated. The remaining two were rescheduled for further questioning.

### Assassinating Gambling Den Owner, Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

Zhang Kangmei and Wang Shouzhang, two shareholders of the Yongyuan gambling den at 121 Lane 1912, Jing'an Temple Road, became enemies due to disputes over power in the partnership. On July 28, 1939, Wang organized a gang to assassinate Zhang at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Difeng Road, killing him. Afterwards, the police station arrested Wang and his accomplice, Mao Xiangyun, and sent them to the Special Court No. 1, where Wang was sentenced to life imprisonment and Mao was sentenced to ten years in prison. Now, Li Yinmin and Chen Jinsheng, Huatan of the Xinzha Police Station, arrested Liu Jincheng and Zhou Tiebao, the actual perpetrators, in Room 311 of the New World Hotel and sent them to the Special Court No. 1. The trial has concluded, and Judge Shi announced the verdict yesterday morning: Liu was sentenced to life imprisonment and Zhou was sentenced to eight years in prison as a warning.

### Removing Reflective Lights from Cars

Recently, the number of cars equipped with reflective lights (Spotlights) has been gradually increasing. However, these lights have always been prohibited, so the police stations of the two concessions have notified car owners who have installed these lights to quickly remove them to comply with the regulations. According to the police stations, these lights can be rotated up and down, forward and backward, so their use greatly hinders the safety of oncoming cars and pedestrians.

### Rickshaw Fares Increased by 20%, Mutual Aid Association Board Member Selection

The rickshaw companies in this city plan to raise rental prices. After an on-site investigation by the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, the half-mile rate will be changed from 17 cents to 20 cents, and the hourly rate will be changed from one yuan to one yuan and twenty cents, an increase of two-tenths compared to before, starting on July 15. According to a notice from the Engineering Bureau, Wang Zhiren, Pastor Si Maoer, and Mr. Hanson have accepted the invitation of the Bureau and agreed to represent the Bureau as directors of the Public Rickshaw Driver Mutual Aid Association Board of Directors this year.

### Taiwan Disaster Relief Ended

Together with the 60,000 yuan previously remitted to Taiwan, the total has reached 100,500 yuan. Because the relief work is mostly completed, the Association has decided to end its operations. A record of donations will be printed to ensure transparency.

### Gun Case in Nanshi, Japanese Soldier Shot and Wounded, One Bullet in Chest and One in Foot, Serious Injuries, Iron Gates to Concession Completely Closed

At 4:15 PM yesterday, Sergeant Nishideji (20 years old), an engineer from the Japanese Army's Guochuan unit, led three Japanese soldiers to set up barbed wire near Wangjia Alley on Limalu Road in Nanshi. Suddenly, a young man rushed out from the roadside, drew a pistol, and fired more than ten shots at Nishideji. Nishideji was caught off guard and was shot twice, once in the foot and once in the chest. He immediately bled profusely and collapsed to the ground, barely breathing. The shooter, seeing that his goal had been achieved, took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The Japanese garrison in Nanshi received the news and immediately dispatched a large number of armed military police to the scene, cut off traffic, and searched every household in the surrounding area. At the same time, the iron gates leading to the concession were closed at about 4:30 PM, completely cutting off traffic between Nanshi and the concession. Until 12 PM last night, the search was still ongoing. At that time, citizens entering and leaving the iron gates were blocked inside and outside the gates, about a thousand people, all sighing at the gate. It is said that the telephone trunk lines on the Nanshi side were also cut off at the same time. Also, when the shooting occurred, a passerby was injured by a stray bullet. Later, the Japanese sent him to the Academy for treatment, and the Japanese soldier was sent to the Military Academy for treatment.

### Pork Prices Soar

Due to the shortage of fresh pork in this city, only about 200 pigs are slaughtered daily. Therefore, all fresh meat shops cannot obtain pigs and have no goods to sell, causing prices to skyrocket. Prices vary from store to store. Leg meat is priced from 4.40 yuan to over 5 yuan per jin, and ribs are priced from over 4 yuan to 4.80 yuan, which is extremely chaotic. Most of this pork is refrigerated pork and white-haired pork (i.e., local pork, commonly known as dry-foot pork). Slaughterhouses in Hongkou have already stopped slaughtering since yesterday. If no pigs arrive today, the shortage will be even greater.

### Russian Woman Commits Suicide in Cathay Hotel

A Russian woman named Robert, 27 years old, rented Room 627 of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, at about 3 PM this afternoon, she suddenly committed suicide by swallowing poison in the room. Afterwards, a waiter at the hotel discovered this and reported it to Hongen College on Daxilu Road for treatment.

Commemoration

### Sincere Celebration

— Jing Zhi

The streets are crowded with people, "Sold Out" signs hang at the entrances of movie theaters, the business in pubs and restaurants is ten times more prosperous than usual, and dance halls prominently display signs saying "All Night Tonight"... and floating above all this noisy, bustling scene is a fat, drunken red face, two squinting eyes full of red veins, a cloyingly sweet smile, an oily mouth, and a hoarse, half-drunken voice:

"Today is National Day, hmm, National Day. Once a year, rare, rare, everyone should have a good time, have a good time! Aiya, aiya, let's have another drink..."

Celebrating by having a good time, indeed a profound meaning. The amber-colored wine can symbolize the bright red blood shed by the martyrs; bursts of laughter can be compared to the shouts of charging soldiers; the crackling applause and guessing games can also be regarded as the explosions of guns and bombs. But unfortunately, the woman serving the wine beside him and the rows of delicacies in front of him, such things would never be found on the battlefield, but now the celebrants of the "Prosperous Age" absolutely cannot lack such things.

The reason why National Day is worth celebrating is that its meaning lies in commemorating the new creation and the demise of the old. Here, we should commemorate the martyrs who made such achievements. Here, we should also reflect on ourselves, whether we have fulfilled our due responsibilities.

We should be optimistic, we should be happy, we should raise the celebratory wine glasses high. But this joy should encourage us forward, and the celebratory wine should only be a stimulant and not an anesthetic, because we cannot sink, we must inherit the legacy of the martyrs.

Using celebration to indulge personal licentious desires; using celebration as a supplement to wine; smearing the glorious Double Tenth with oily and lewd smiles, this is not right! It not only desecrates the country but also loses one's own personality.

In the sound of autumn rain, autumn wind, and yellow leaves falling, the Double Tenth Festival is approaching us again. Theaters have scheduled especially exciting programs, and restaurants have prepared their best dishes. Many people are preparing to have a day of revelry.

But, you who are clever and promising, what are you planning to do?

Announcement of Essay Contest Results

### I Learned a Lesson

— Le Yunzhan

It was five years ago. I and my friend Mr. Chen lived together in a pavilion, because we got along well and were both unemployed at the time. In the same plight and environment, the two of us lived almost as if we were dependent on each other. At that time, prices were not as high as they are now, but three copper coins could only buy a big pancake, and we had to find a way to get the money to fill our stomachs.

Fortunately, Chen was also very optimistic. When our pockets were empty and it was time to eat -

"What to do?"

"What to do?"

We would smile at each other, albeit reluctantly, but there was not a trace of worry on our faces. He often looked up at the sky outside the window, and I naturally knew that he was not appreciating the white clouds in the sky; just like me, he often liked to lie on the bed, holding the back of his neck with both hands, racking his brains to search for a way to solve the problem of the day or the meal.

In this situation, we never blamed each other. In fact, for example:

"Does the cigarette addiction kill you?" Then he would pass over a whole pack or a few scattered cigarettes.

When I thought of a solution, I would not forget to buy him some wine and snacks to go with it.

After three cups, he couldn't help but start singing; as for me, with a cigarette in hand, I was also very relaxed and content. And the slower and harder it was to find a solution that day, the more flavorful the cigarettes and wine and the whiter the rice seemed to be. And because of the emotional harmony in our situation, the joy of each other's spirits was even more evident.

We lived like this for almost three or four months. My family managed to send me a sum of money, and through a friend's introduction, I got a job. The daily living problems of the two of us were solved from then on.

So I left early and returned late every day. As for him, he no longer had to worry about his stomach, and naturally, I didn't forget to leave him some money to buy wine to get drunk.

Tens of days passed like this, and I was confident that there were no grudges between us. It was just that when we met, because there was no longer the tense atmosphere of being hungry, we gradually felt that we had lost the joy of being drunk and full.

Unexpectedly, two days after I received my second month's salary, he left quietly. He left me a short letter, which read:

"××!

Goodbye, are you surprised? I know deeply: if I waited until you were not surprised to leave, it would be too late. Since you got a job, I have been living off you. But do you know? An invisible wall has separated us. At the same time, your deep friendship has caused me even more unease. I have experienced that when life reaches a fork in the road, no matter how deep the friendship, the loser should have a way to deal with himself.

I secretly took half of your salary this time, and you certainly won't think I'm greedy. As for our unfinished friendship, let's leave it to a future meeting!..." After reading his letter, my heart felt like it had been cut with a deep gash, and from this gash, I realized that material satisfaction and enjoyment can sometimes obscure true feelings and true fun. But I seemed to understand the meaning between people a little better.

### Welcoming National Day

— Lin Chang

Facts show us that the light is about to come: although we often feel suffocated here and now, it is only a short time. The victory that is currently being transmitted to us from the front is certainly an inevitable result. As the National Day of the Republic of China in the 30th year approaches, as citizens, we must not only conduct a self-examination but also welcome our symbol of light with joy and tension.

The lessons that history has given us are indeed great. We must remember and reminisce, and be more vigilant and strive. The great National Day was won by the great heads and bloody battles of thousands of martyrs; the current liberation adds unparalleled brilliance to this festival.

Thirty years ago, the Qing government, which was established in opposition to the public's objective demands, also wanted to establish national industries hastily, but due to economic foundations and various conditions, it was difficult to maintain them in the end; on the one hand, it did not reform the feudal political institutions, causing the people to suffer multiple pains. Revolutionary leader Mr. Sun Yat-sen, after all, armed the people with foresight, not afraid of sacrifice, and launched the Xinhai Revolution, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, and built the new Republic of China.

The new China experienced several hardships, and finally, after the Northern Expedition, the Great Revolution laid the foundation for national unification; later, the National Renaissance Festival also became a valuable commemoration in history. The Chinese nation wants to create a new page in history and move towards the road of liberation; it also affects the world, serving as the vanguard against aggression, and will never be discouraged halfway, no matter how difficult the situation is. This is something to be proud of. On this festival, we must also examine ourselves: as citizens, have we forgotten our own position? Are we selfish, hindering the future of the entire country for the sake of small interests? At this time and place, have we made any effort to engage in relief for refugees, compatriots, and disaster-stricken children, and to make contributions? The light is about to come, but when we welcome it, we must also straighten ourselves up.

### Jianggan

— Leiting

The afterglow of the setting sun is shining on the old man's white hair, he silently watches the De standing in front of him, his face is sad and heroic. The chimes of the customs are not clear, the approaching passenger ferry is also blurred, the old man has fallen into a strange emotion, this emotion only I can understand, because I was standing very close to him at the time, and only my heart has been more in tune with him over the years.

The old man once revealed to me his inner pride after drinking that he had three tall and strong sons, and it can be said that his life was spent running around to cultivate his three sons, and he never felt tired. When the greatest day in the history of the motherland came, he unreservedly put his eldest son Yong into the arms of the motherland; two years passed, the military uniform was just sent, and the family letter arrived again. Yong said that because of his strong physique and sharp eyes, his superiors gave him more opportunities to serve the country, ordering him to abandon the mechanic and serve as a machine gunner. Before deciding, please ask his loving father. I remember that the reply was in the old man's vigorous handwriting: "The life of a young man belongs to the motherland, and the father must not tell you not to be a machine gunner." In the week after that, Ying left a letter and left: "The motherland is beckoning to me, Dad, your son will fight side by side with his eldest brother in the air." The old man did not shed tears because of this, but Jianggan added a lot of heavy wandering.

Now it's the third son's turn, eighteen-year-old De resolutely wants to catch up with his eldest brother and second brother, he said that he is not weaker than them at all. In the sound of the whistle, when his hands are tightly clenched, the old man sheds tears sadly, I forgive him, he only has three sons after all! When the silhouette of the wheel disappeared into the twilight, the old man monologued: "My tears are because there is no fourth son to send him to the motherland's expedition!" I am ashamed, my forgiveness for him is obviously incomprehensible. Looking at his solemn expression, like a giant standing on Jianggan, I really don't believe that there will be such a great father in the world!

### Machine Gun Highway

— Ke Zhong

The American automobile industry is extremely developed. Even ordinary working-class families often use cars instead of walking. Because there are so many vehicles, accidents often occur. To prevent accidents, the road administration authorities have specified various driving rules and painted a white line in the middle of the road to prevent vehicles from crossing this line. However, because there are fewer pedestrians on the highway and there are no police officers to supervise at all times, it is not uncommon for people to cross the line. In view of this, the road administration authorities of Kansas, USA, have built a "machine gun highway," which is paved with cement strips in the middle of the road, each strip one foot apart, and painted black to attract the attention of drivers. If anyone crosses this "machine gun line," their wheels will be severely shaken, as a kind of warning.

### Youth Activities in the United States

— Ge Liang

In the United States, more than 30,000 young people are doing scientific and mechanical research after school. They are trying to solve all the problems that are considered difficult—even some problems that adults don't think of, and they have achieved results.

Not long ago, a seventeen-year-old boy from California invented a radio, the size of a palm, which can not only receive telegrams but also send telegrams. The American Inventors Registry sent many experts to investigate and discuss, and the results showed that it could be used to transmit messages in the army. Another child discovered the most accurate method to measure the acidity or alkalinity of substances. A child from Boston created a darkroom—a portable glass box with an opening for two hands to reach into it. The four sides of the box are equipped with red gelatin. When developing negatives, the photographer can clearly see the movements of his hands, and the light cannot damage the negatives, so negatives can also be developed in a bright room. Recently, a high school student, after working in a power plant during the summer, invented a new type of switch for fluorescent lamps, which has made the position of fluorescent lamps in industry more solid.

Who said that young people or teenagers cannot become inventors? Marconi was only twenty-one years old when he invented the radio, and Pan Jin was only eighteen years old when he invented the coloring essence dye for home industry. Furthermore, isn't Edison an even better example?

Most of the children are doing research work in schools. Two large companies in New York have specially set up a laboratory, which is provided free of charge to those young people for research, but they must be recommended by the student's principal or parents.

There, a fifteen-year-old child is focusing on conducting experiments to make light transmit sound, a fourteen-year-old child has discovered how to convert kitchen waste into fertilizers, carbon, and tar substances, and three older young people are busy testing a new method of controlling aircraft with radio.

In the specially designated animal kingdom, a child is trying to predict the gender of mice, and another is studying the evolution and heredity of fruit flies.

Those young people almost all belong to the more than 790 youth societies, which are directly under the American Institute of Research. The institute was founded 113 years ago to promote people with inventive talents. Those young people only need to pay a fee of one dime per year to compete for many scholarships in the society, and at the annual meeting of the society, based on each person's records over the past year, they can have the hope of winning a scholarship of 3,000 yuan.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Thirteen wandering to Shanghai

"A few years ago, when I was still at my mother's house, once the red-bearded leader outside the pass, what's-his-name Zhang Zuolin, fought with our Wu Peifu here, and so many cannons were fired, weren't they? Is it as loud as the sky and earth shaking? It seems that our China is about to..."

Meibao and Begonia were both standing outside the Meng family's shop, looking very uneasy at the many refugees who had fled from the Renqiu area who had been constantly walking on the street since last night. No one bothered to pay attention to what Mrs. Meng was saying.

At about six or seven o'clock, six or seven hundred soldiers surged like a tide on the road. Although they had just been transferred from the front line, they were very energetic and disciplined. After entering the village, an officer first went to the Li village chief's house to find him. The rest of the people and baggage rested outside the village, and no one dared to move a step.

"This must be the Twenty-Ninth Army," Meibao whispered to her father.

"How do you know that?" The one who asked the question was Little Gouzi.

"I heard it from the teacher at school a long time ago."

Little Gouzi and Begonia were not very convinced at first. Later, after the officer and Li village chief discussed the arrangements for borrowing accommodation, seven soldiers moved into their house. Begonia greeted them, and they were indeed subordinates of the ××th Division of the Twenty-Ninth Army. (233)

Spring and Autumn

### Thirtieth Double Tenth Festival Address

— Wei San

Amidst the great victory in Xiangbei, the whole country is inspired and joyful. Following this, the good news of the Chinese army's recapture of Yichang was announced. Facts show us that this is the prelude to the final victory. Compatriots suffocated on the isolated island have been enduring mental pain for four years, and now they have finally taken a breath. These days, everyone's hearts are blossoming, and they are excited and happy. Look, aren't the people walking on the road all energetic? On this day when victory is frequently reported, the autumn is high and the sky is clear, and the national flag of Blue Sky, White Sun, and Crimson Ground hangs all over the streets. We are celebrating the Double Tenth Festival of the 30th year of the Republic of China again, and we feel especially cordial and enthusiastic.

"Be not arrogant in victory, nor discouraged in defeat." Aren't these two sentences often in our minds? When Guangzhou fell and Wuhan was lost, everyone was not discouraged. On the contrary, they strengthened their belief that we would have this day—the final victory. At present, the process period from this day is already countable, and the good news from the front line strengthens the guarantee of the final victory. At this critical moment, everyone should be more calm and work harder.

When US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill met at sea, in addition to planning military affairs, they also formulated a great plan to rebuild a world after the war. I think we should also take advantage of this auspicious National Day to formulate a plan to be a new person after victory, so that we can be worthy of the country, worthy of ourselves, and not waste today's precious Double Tenth Festival.

The Double Tenth Festival in the 30th year of the Republic of China has a total of five crosses, which is an auspicious symbol. From the perspective of the entire nation, it represents the five major ethnic groups of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan, who are united in the spirit of sacrifice and struggle, and jointly obtain the arrival of light. On this day next year, everyone's enthusiasm for congratulating the National Day will be hundreds of times greater than this year. This bright belief must be shared by all of us.

### Returning Science with Science

— Jiang Cun

The saying "Science is omnipotent" cannot be said to be an exaggeration today, but can be said to be truly true. Although there are still some secrets in the universe that science has not yet broken, from the perspective of science, this is not "unable" but only "unknown." Once known, it will definitely be able to break it. Today, science still has "unknown," but it absolutely does not have "impossible."

Since science has developed to the point it is today, whether you believe in the omnipotence of science or not, science has made it impossible for your life to get rid of the power of science. Science has seized the power of life and death of mankind! The material civilization produced by science, such as transportation, medicine, and even clothing, food, housing, etc., you cannot refuse, cannot do without, and cannot but rely on. In the past, there were no electric poles or wooden trains in Shanghai, but they came uninvited. After they came, because of superstition in feng shui and disbelief in science, they were all demolished, but what is the result today? Aren't electric poles standing tall in Shanghai, and the Chinese free zone is rushing to build railways and it seems too late!

Japan is using the two major products of science, armaments and machines, to fight with China, to cooperate with China economically, forcibly creating a co-prosperity sphere, and forcibly creating a new order, causing the people to suffer, and it has not ended yet. Fortunately, on the one hand, because China has a large land area and abundant resources, unlimited manpower, and strong will, and on the other hand, because Japan's scientific power is not enough to conquer China in one breath, it has finally forced Japan's mechanized troops to fall into the quagmire and have no way to use their skills. But it is absolutely impossible to disbelieve in science just because we see that Japan cannot conquer China. The bombing of Chinese cities and the oppression of the people are ultimately due to the great loss of lagging behind in science. Therefore, to revive China and to make China never again suffer oppression and be gloriously free and independent in the world, everyone must unite and catch up in the direction of science! All undertakings must be managed with scientific methods!

The state is supreme and the nation comes first, which everyone should recognize, but "science is omnipotent" must also be recognized at the same time. Otherwise, once the scientific power of ambitious countries is sufficient to swallow China, it will swallow it! An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, war for war, science for science, this is China's only way out.

### Preparing for a Comprehensive Celebration

— Ye Jingfeng

The National Day commemoration, which was scheduled for a comprehensive victory since the war began, has been expected for four years until this year, but it has never been realized. However, based on the results of observations from various aspects, it is expected that the comprehensive celebration that we are expecting—a National Day commemoration and grand celebration with great pleasure and enthusiasm—will probably be held in the next session.

What this article discusses is not the form, program, etc. of the celebration, but rather to ask whether we citizens have made complete preparations when the day of this grand celebration arrives!

What kind of preparation? Or what kind of preparation?

First, of course, is to prepare a devout belief, simply a religious belief, believing that the Republic of China is sure to have such a grand National Day commemoration of a comprehensive victory coming in the next session. Namely, in the next session!

The second thing that needs to be prepared is a clean body and mind. In other words, when the day of the grand National Day celebration arrives, everyone is enthusiastically participating in the grand event of celebration, but we are privately not so happy to the end, perhaps because we feel that there is something wrong with our hearts, because we are not so completely clean.

If you have ever done something that is slightly unclean or sorry to others, you should take advantage of this year's Double Tenth commemoration and make a vow to quickly wash yourself clean, repent, and move towards the bright road. Confucius said, "If you have made a mistake, do not be afraid to correct it"; you must never be confused to the end!

Another preparation is to actually do a few things to promote the holding of a National Day commemoration of a comprehensive victory in the next session. Since we are a member of the nation, the affairs of the country cannot only be held with a mindset of "not seeking merit but seeking no fault." Faults should not be had, and merits must be done at least a little. Like this huge number of a nation, for the affairs of the country, as long as every citizen acts with conscience, and everyone shares the responsibility, everyone believes that there is nothing that cannot be done.

We are sure to prepare for a comprehensive and glorious National Day commemoration in the next session!

### Light is in Sight

### National Crisis and National Day

— Jin Zhongliang

Celebrating the National Day of a sovereign country with complete territory, which is a free and equal country in the international community, is the real National Day. At this time and place, to achieve this goal, we must unite sincerely and vow to go together, which is the broad road to the destination!

### Celebrating National Day with Endeavor

— Pingye

Ten years of sorrow, four years of hardship, what have we contributed to the masses in this great era, and what have we encouraged ourselves to do? Now, as the Republic of China is established and reaches the age of thirty, with brightness in sight, we joyfully celebrate National Day, expressing our feelings to remind ourselves.

We are still in the midst of arduous struggle, but only through struggle can we survive, and only through struggle can we have joy. Unceasing struggle ensures the eternal life of the nation. Let us consider what kind of people are growing up in today's era, and what kind of people are becoming the dregs of the era. With brightness in sight, we hope that in the course of nation-building, we will all embrace the determination to endure hardship and labor, possess uprightness that allows us to face heaven and earth without shame, remember the hardships of the martyrs' struggle, and be even more mindful of our unfulfilled responsibilities as those who come after. Let us not betray our original intentions or slacken our long-cherished aspirations. This is the first thing that citizens of this era should recognize.

The nation's gates face wind and rain, and the Central Plains are in turmoil. All the hardships we have endured in the past and present are valuable lessons for the emerging nation of tomorrow. Saving the nation through science should be the priority, and economic construction should strengthen the foundation of the nation. From now on, we must exhaust the collective wisdom to unleash the power of the masses, establish self-defense science, and consolidate economic fortresses. Saving the nation through science and enriching the people through economy will be the two cornerstones of the new China of tomorrow. This is the second thing that citizens of this era should recognize.

On the National Day of the 30th year of the Republic of China, we respectfully encourage the people of the nation with the spirit of struggle and urge them to promote scientific construction and economic development. We eagerly await this day next year to celebrate the rebirth of our land and rivers, solidify the foundation of our nation on bedrock, and jointly celebrate a joyous festival that will forever be the light of our nation.

### Reflections on the Double Tenth Festival

— Wan Xinqi

According to some ethnologists, Chinese people are among the races with the strongest memories in the world, and I believe this. However, I always feel that Chinese people are sometimes extraordinarily forgetful. For example, there are quite a few commemorative festivals in China, and if we trace their origins, they are all extraordinary and can give us vivid historical lessons. However, whenever a festival arrives, everyone just feels the need to decorate a bit, offer some well wishes, respond to the scene, and join in the fun, as if the ancients left behind such a festival just for the sake of making people happy for a day. How many people truly glean historical insights from commemoration and take their lives seriously! In fact, we not only fail to shift customs because of festivals, but we are often shifted by customs, resulting in a traditional atmosphere of celebrating for the sake of celebrating. The Dragon Boat Festival is said to commemorate the day when the great poet Qu Yuan drowned himself, but in reality, every year on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, everyone only knows to eat zongzi, hang calamus and moxa, respect ancestors, and worship heaven and earth, while the commemorated Qu Yuan is left behind. This is still understandable: Qu Yuan is ultimately too far removed from our lives, and remembering or forgetting him will not have any impact on history. But if someone uses the traditional temperament of the Dragon Boat Festival to deal with commemorative days closely connected to our lives, it would be utterly muddled. Unfortunately, our old temper is not easily changed; the birth date of the Republic of China—the Double Tenth Festival—has almost been spent in perfunctory celebration ceremonies every year. Every year on this day, the government and the public are busy hanging flags and decorations, and holding meetings as usual. These are naturally indispensable. But some people seem to celebrate the Double Tenth Festival only for these ceremonies, which is not much different from their celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival or worshiping the Mid-Autumn Festival. As for why and for what purpose we commemorate the Double Tenth Festival, how to learn the lessons of the Xinhai Revolution, how to examine past work achievements, and how to develop future revolutionary undertakings, these topics have no place in the minds of most people. If you bother certain pleasure-seekers and ceremony-first individuals with these questions, they will give you a contemptuous smile, indicating that you don't understand the ways of the world and are a killjoy.

Thirty years ago, when the revolutionary martyrs fought the Manchu rulers with blood, they did not think of arranging a festival for us; they only wanted to wholeheartedly destroy the autocratic ideology of a foreign race and fight for the freedom of the Chinese people. On the eve of the Xinhai Revolution, the Founding Father clearly declared in the Tongmenghui declaration: "Past revolutions only aimed at restoration and did not transfer anything else. We today are different from the past. In addition to expelling the Manchus and restoring China, the national system and the people's livelihood should also be reformed with the people. Although there are ten thousand strands, their consistent spirit is freedom, equality, and universal love." It was for the transformation of the "national system and the people's livelihood," for "freedom, equality, and universal love," that the revolutionary martyrs fought tirelessly with the heroic spirit of advancing wave upon wave. On October 10, 1911, the sound of gunfire at Chu Wangtai signaled the collapse of the Manchu Dynasty, which had ruled China for more than 260 years, like an iceberg. After that came the Republic of China.

The reason why October 10 is worth commemorating is not only because it gave us the title of "master of the Republic," but mainly because from that day on, "freedom, equality, and universal love" have officially served as the guiding principles for the progress of the Chinese nation. Unfortunately, in the past thirty years, we have not fulfilled the great expectations of the Founding Father in the era of the Xinhai Revolution. Although the Qing Empire has been replaced with the label of the Republic of China, the nation still suffers from the abuse of others and is still struggling for survival. Civil rights have been frustrated, and people's livelihoods have not yet improved. Although we cannot conclude from this that China has not made progress in the past thirty years—the facts indicate that today is much more advanced than thirty years ago—we are still very far from the nation-building goals envisioned by the Founding Father, which is undoubtedly a very shameful thing.

Now, the Double Tenth Festival of the 30th year of the Republic of China has arrived again. I hope that everyone will first not forget the national crisis in the national celebration, second, not forget to examine themselves when celebrating the festival, and most importantly, remember the Founding Father's nation-building teachings, not forget the hardship of the martyrs' pioneering efforts, and strive for freedom, equality, and universal love.

We need a good memory to remember the origin and meaning of the Double Tenth Festival!

### Thoughts on the Double Tenth and Beyond

— Yu Xinen

The significance of the Double Tenth Festival is significant and well-known. Coincidentally, it also has such memorable numbers—double tens—making it a day that people easily remember. Therefore, its significance will often be deeply embedded in people's hearts.

The cross is a good symbol. In Christianity, it represents sacrifice, service, and hardship. Because Jesus sacrificed himself for all and died on the cross, this selfless and fearless spirit has been promoted and praised even today, nearly two thousand years later. Such a sacrifice is too great.

In the academic world, the cross represents rescue, health, and service. The creation of great achievements is not accidental; it often requires a series of setbacks and polishing. Its success depends on whether one can endure hardship, be patient, and persevere. Among many conditions, a healthy spirit and body occupy an important position. Mencius said it well: "Therefore, when Heaven is about to entrust a great task to someone, it must first inflict suffering on their mind, toil on their sinews, starve their body, and empty their being..." These words have been around for more than two thousand years and are still as true as ever. But seeing that many promising talents in our country are healthy, but many are also weak and sickly, and seeing that people in European and American countries, many of whom are over sixty or seventy years old, can still work hard and achieve great things, and some even hold the fate of a country, what kind of healthy body will it take to be competent?

In addition to its own significance, the Double Tenth Festival bears at least two major missions, and they go hand in hand. The merit of great sacrifice is eternally immortal; although the journey in the world is not long, it has completed its merit. This requires a kind of魄力 (courage). Others still need people to continue to work hard and struggle. If the body is not sound and the physical strength is not up to the task, and the years of serving are greatly shortened, such early and unnecessary sacrifices, unrecorded deeds, are indeed a great loss in the course of creating great careers today!

### My Love for "Spring and Autumn"

— Zhao Jingshen

I have no research on the historical materials of the founding of the country. The editor of this journal asked me to write a commemorative text for the Double Tenth Festival. Being poor in words, I couldn't write a single word. If the editor looked for Zhang Yuying, the editor of "Bibliography of the Xinhai Revolution" (Xuelin, Issue 6), it would be convenient for both of us.

But because I can't hand in a blank paper, I want to briefly talk about my views on "Spring and Autumn." I think "Spring and Autumn" is very well edited, especially the self-statements describing the suffering of various social classes, which are most touching and can arouse my resonance. Also, those cartoons, in just a minute or less, can provide a warning revelation.

However, my interest is in the study of Chinese popular literature. Although it is a specialty, it is a specialty that studies novels and dramas that are prevalent in various social classes. Therefore, in the past, I loved the "Spring and Autumn" even more, especially the "Anecdotes of Shanghai" by Hangxie Zhaizhu, which was serialized in "Female Ballad Singing" for six days and "Storytelling Magazines" for only one day, "Twentieth Century Grand Stage" (Actor Magazine), etc. Also, Shen You's "Female Ballad Singing," which was published for thirteen days, was also loved by me.

Recently, I have also loved reading Mr. Liutang's "Anecdotes." The Ullambana Festival and the Biography of Characters in the Cat Case are interesting topics. Regarding the former, I wrote an article on "The Evolution of the Mulian Story" in this month's special issue of Novel Monthly; regarding the latter, I wrote an article on "The Legend of Bao Gong" in "Idle Talks about Novels" (Beixin Edition). Recently, after reading the Biography of Characters in the Cat Case, perhaps soon I will write a short article in Yikan of the Yu Zhou Feng to introduce this interesting textual research in more detail. Liutang is actually Feng Liutang. His "God of Wealth" and "Clock" (mentioning the surprise and admiration for clocks and watches often found in the Dream of the Red Chamber) published in the Economic News are also loved by me.

As a reader, I take advantage of the Double Tenth Festival to express my love for "Spring and Autumn," which can barely be regarded as a commemorative text.

### Welcoming the 30th National Day

— Xu Daming

Thirty years is not a short time. Even looking at a person, from birth to thirty years old, it should at least be a promising period of youth and strength. And a young man should be in the years of daring to speak, daring to do, and daring to take responsibility.

However, today's China is not as healthy as the ideal young man. Not only is it cut to pieces, but it even suffers from "rheumatism," sometimes making it unable to move. Therefore, this handsome young man has lost his health and has been confined to the circle of illness all year round!

However, we are not pessimistic. On the contrary, precisely because of his loss of health, we must work extra hard to fulfill the responsibilities that doctors should fulfill, so that this young man who has just turned thirty can recover.

Here, we are fortunate that this young man still has a healthy skeleton. Although his body is covered with sores and inhabited by many bacteria, the skeleton is still so healthy and so strong.

At the same time, he not only has a good skeleton, but also many good doctors who can cure diseases, countless assistants, and enough "natural capital" to restore his health.

Especially, what we are happy about is that although 良學 (Liang Xue, good learning or good doctors) has lost a little, he has left behind a "good prescription" that can bring this young man back to life, that is, our Founding Father Sun Yat-sen and his teachings.

At the same time, as long as we can take this prescription without any distortion and follow the teachings, then we believe that not only will the patient recover soon, but the emergence of "Liang Xue" may have an astonishing number and achievement.

However, what we feel sad about is that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings have not been properly used for decades. And this prescription for saving China has always been pressed in the medicine box by some students.

In fact, in theory, for the sake of the patient's recovery and strength, we should have the right to deny those who delay the patient; on the one hand, we must support the good doctors who "feel the pain of the people as if it were their own."

In short, the first horn on the city wall of Wuchang on October 10, thirty years ago, and the revolutionary banner of "freedom, equality, and universal love" that the Founding Father personally raised to overthrow the autocratic rule of the Manchu Qing should be remembered today; and the hardship of the pioneering efforts of the martyrs of the Xinhai Revolution and the suffering in the middle should also be left to today as a lesson. Especially, the experience of China in the past thirty years, turning on rugged roads, should be the valuable information we need to learn today - because only in this way can we make this young China, which is just thirty years old, embark on a healthy path.

We hope that from the National Day of the 30th year, we will welcome it with strong hands and brains, and exchange it for our freedom, equality, and universal love. Because this is a meaningful celebration, if it is only with pure ceremonies, or tears and disappointment, then it is not a true commemoration - a commemoration that has lost its meaning and gone out of shape!

Learning from our Founding Father and learning from the Founding Father's teachings is the first key to welcoming the National Day!

Entertainment World

### A Twenty-Minute Interview with Cheng Yanqiu

— Zhen Chang

Fatter Figure, Still Makes People Drunk and Crazy

Newly Compiled Script, Based on Kunqu Opera "Hundred Flowers Pointing Generals"

Mei's Trip to Chongqing, Seems Unlikely to Become a Reality

Rise of Spoken Drama, A Good Phenomenon for the Theater World

In this clear and crisp autumn season, Cheng Yanqiu, the master of Yu Shuang Yi, once again led the entire staff of the Qiu Sheng Society to perform in Shanghai. The seat prices were so high, but it was still difficult to get a seat in the theater every night, which shows that the people of Shanghai who love the Cheng style and love to listen to Qiu Sheng are enthusiastic. On the afternoon of the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, a colleague and I met Cheng Yanqiu, the master of the Qiu Sheng Society who was sensationalizing the Shanghai opera world, at the Astor House Hotel, this English-style hotel.

In the quiet living room, Cheng Yanqiu, with a smile and a refined manner, met with us. Also sitting with us was Sun Lanting, the manager of the Golden Grand Theater. Because he is an artist who does not come often, so when he arrives in Shanghai, he is busy all day with social gatherings and receptions. Ten minutes after meeting us, he was about to rush to a tea party at another place, so we sat down and chatted in these short twenty minutes.

Cheng is fatter than the last time, and it is really hard to imagine that when he puts on makeup, he is still able to make the audience drunk and obsessed. He spoke fluent Mandarin, with a soft tone, but as clear as music, delivered to the ears, with melody and rhythm, like listening to twenty minutes of music and opera.

We started talking to him casually. We asked him, what new script have you brought us this time to listen to? He told us that it was a "Daughter's Heart," which was said to be adapted from a Kunqu opera "Hundred Flowers Pointing Generals." Judging from his past new plays, he must have brought many new Cheng-style tunes and tones. He also told us that after singing in Shanghai, he would go to Yantai, where there would be a charity performance to raise funds to prepare for the construction of the Confucius Temple. This is a good thing. Our conversation turned to Mei Lanfang, who was resting in Hong Kong. He said that he had not received any news about Mei. According to reports, he would go to Chongqing to sing charity performances. In his opinion, it would be difficult to realize, because no matter how good the peony is, it all depends on the green leaves. Even more so for Mei, it is impossible without his old supporting actors. The supporting actors are all in Beiping, which is very difficult. We told him that Mei had grown a beard in Hong Kong, preparing to retire. He replied with a smile: "This beard can be canceled at any time anyway."

We also mentioned Yang Baozhong, the famous Qin master who came this time. I said that Yang's huqin is really beautiful, painted with bright colors, like a violin. The scene on the Chinese stage can also be improved in this way. In fact, the huqin accompaniment for Qingyi has been improved a lot, adding a lot of musical interest. Cheng said: "It is very difficult to improve something in the Chinese theater world. Chinese people like to be so casual. Like foreign operas, the accompanying orchestra wears very beautiful uniforms. If we also ask them to wear them like this, I'm afraid they won't be happy." We responded with a sympathetic smile. Finally, we mentioned his impression of the Shanghai theater world. He said that the vigorous rise of spoken drama in Shanghai in recent years is a good phenomenon for the Shanghai theater world.

Because he was very busy, the twenty-minute conversation came to an end. Coming back and reading Cheng's report on his trip to Europe in 1933 to study opera and music, I deeply admire his cultivation and understanding of opera and musical art.

### Celebrating the Double Tenth Festival

Guolian Movie Stars Ruan Lingyu and Ruan Yingyu, sisters, with similar looks and identical costumes, respectfully wish the Double Tenth Festival a success and the country a prosperous future!

The living room of the Astor House Hotel is quite spacious, with a domed stained glass roof that filters down soft sunlight, creating a very quiet and beautiful atmosphere! We casually sat on the sofa and chatted. When we were about to say goodbye, we asked a friend who came with us to take a casual photo of Cheng in casual clothes.

### Revelry and Amusement

—繑者 (Writer)

Independent and free countries in the world all have a festival of revelry. On this day, the people of the whole country sing and drink loudly, celebrating enthusiastically; men, women, old, and young, rejoice and are encouraged together. For such a festival of universal celebration, every independent and free country should have this day, and independent and free people should have it once a year. However, when we close our eyes and think quietly, a large string of countries that once dominated Europe have now temporarily lost even this festival of revelry! Only our great Republic of China, happily celebrating the Double Tenth Festival today, can still rejoice and be encouraged, and this year is more enthusiastic than last year, and it is predicted that next year will be even more enthusiastic than this year! This is the success of our established national policy. At this time and place, everyone still has to remain calm and actively struggle, waiting for the arrival of light! Life cannot be without struggle, let alone without joy. Seeking joy from struggle and struggling for joy are colorful and energetic lives. The same is true for individuals and countries.

World affairs are like drama, and life is like morning dew. We, who are responsible for our words, should review the "entertainment world" in the extraordinary period on the isolated island. In the past four years, refugees from all over the world have gathered at sea, so the population has suddenly increased, and all kinds of commerce have shifted, developing abnormally, and the entertainment industry has also flourished, with singing and dancing all night long. I always think that excessive extravagance and licentiousness should not be fully exposed at this time. Sitting in an ivory palace, disregarding the current national disaster, and not fulfilling the heavenly duty of benefiting the country and the people, can this still be considered human?

Some people justify themselves: entertainment is a stimulant to dispel boredom and invigorate the spirit. Soldiers in the trenches turn on gramophones, and air-raid shelters in Chongqing still listen to the radio. It is originally not too much to criticize making fun of suffering, and I will never object. However, entertainment must have limits and be measured so as not to depress the will and life. The past is gone, but the future can still be advised. I hope that the employees of the entertainment world at sea, especially the comrades who are producers, directors, and screenwriters, whether it is film, Peking opera, music, local opera, or all kinds of entertainment and acrobatics, must carefully select scripts before their performances, and encourage the end customs, with the development of national consciousness as the warp and the inculcation of loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness as the weft, so that people who are addicted to lustful pleasures can be saved to the greatest extent possible; actors should be determined to hold on to the goal, the skills I perform will never anesthetize people, but are to give the audience a heart booster and a stimulant, cultivate my noble spirit, make expressions that are beneficial to the world and the hearts of the people, and leave a beautiful name for all time. I have written it in a haphazard way, I don't know what the readers think?

Brief News: Today is the auspicious day for the wedding of Miss Zheng Ying, daughter of Mr. Zhang Huisun, a Ningbo businessman. A grand celebration is being held at the Fuxing Garden on Wuma Road, organized by relatives and friends. Famous opera singers from Shanghai's social clubs and well-known performers from the city have been invited to perform Peking Opera to add to the festivities. The repertoire is extremely exciting.

### Tan Fuying and Yang Baosen: Two Senior Male Performers Take the Stage Around National Day (Part 1)

— Guo Yi

Recently, Cheng Yanqiu and Yang Baosen performed at the Huangjin Theater, while the Da Wutai Theater hired Tan Fuying and Zhang Junqiu to counter them. Cheng, Yang, Tan, and Zhang are all considered top choices by today's opera enthusiasts. On the theatrical stage, they compete and strive to win! Not counting the deceased veteran performers of the past, such a wealth of talent has been rare in recent years. Their performances are scheduled to coincide with the Double Tenth Festival, serving to embellish the celebrations. Moreover, news of victories from the Xiangbei and Exi battlefronts is frequently heard, which invigorates people's spirits even more. Among these performers, Zhang Junqiu is the youngest. Due to her beautiful appearance and excellent voice, as well as her diligent efforts, she quickly distinguished herself and her reputation has risen rapidly. However, if she is to be compared to Yanqiu, she is a second-tier choice and cannot be compared directly. As for Baosen and Fuying, they were known as rivals since childhood. After Baosen formed his own troupe, he frequently competed with Fuying in the old capital, with alternating wins and losses. Their strengths are quite comparable. Now that they meet again in Shanghai, Baosen should devote all his efforts to compete with him, just as Fuying once did with Lian Liang. Opera enthusiasts will frequent both theaters to observe and discern, judging the depth of their achievements and evaluating their worth. Wouldn't the situation be exciting? Furthermore, it is of great importance to the future gains and losses of Tan and Yang, which is worthy of attention. Those who think that Yanqiu and Fuying have different styles of Qingyi and Lao Sheng roles and cannot compete are merely speaking based on reputation, without examining the reality. The outcome of this competition depends on the efforts of Baosen and Fuying.

### New Drinking Game for the Double Tenth Festival

— Xu Chu

If tonight, Peking Opera or Kunqu Opera fans or audience members are happy and want to hold a small banquet to celebrate our great victories in Changsha and Yichang, and the new Double Tenth Festival, then we might as well try a new drinking game.

For Peking Opera, each person has to say the name of a play, and the name must contain the words "October Tenth" in order. For example:

October
Da Gong Lao (Great Merit)
Gong De Bao

Tenth
Dao Ben Zhang (i.e. Gong Men Dai)
Yue Tu

Another example:

October Tenth
San Tai Bao (i.e. Feihu Mountain)
Xia Zhan Diao
Yi Lang Song Li (i.e. Baishuitan)
Zao San Xian (i.e. Maozhou Temple)

Anyone who can't say one will be penalized with a drink or made to tell a story.

For Kunqu Opera, complete miscellaneous dramas and romances need not be limited to those who can sing, nor need they be limited to "hidden head format," but may come up with a "staggered format":

Bai Wu October Tenth
Jin Tang Ting (Legend of Ming Ma Su Ren) (Yuan Shi Hui? Opera)
Cuo Ren Yin (Legend of Ming Ruan Da Yue) (Miscellaneous Drama of Ming Xu Chao)

A single excerpt can be exemplified as follows:

Jian Xiao Hong October Tenth
Mian (Collection of Music Scores) (Collection of Music Scores, etc.)
Mian (Na Shu Ying Music Score) (Na Shu Ying Music Score)

Perhaps this could be named the "Dragon Head Format"? The last three excerpts all embed the second character, while the first excerpt embeds the first character, giving the appearance of a proud head raising. The above are just a few examples. For example, the full "Fifteen Strings of Cash," "Ten Beauties," "Ten Brocade Embankments," "Ten Righteous Records," and excerpts such as You Gui Ji Bai Yue, Xi Lou Ji Zai Yue, Lian Huan Ji Bai Yue, Shi Ju Pen Lao Yue, and Bangzi Tune Yue Cheng can all be used. If there is no limit to Beijing Kunqu Opera or spoken drama opera, the scope is wider and it is easier to hold. Then Li Jinhui's "Moonlit Night" and Cao Yu's "Sunrise" can also be used.

Commercial News

### Yarn & Cotton The Pressure from Various Parties is Truly Strong, Forcing Speculators to Provide Warehouse Receipts

Seeing that speculators have no real power and are caught off guard, another limit-up price increase creates an overwhelming atmosphere.

After the limit-down price on the 8th, the Shuang Ma yarn market rebounded with a limit-up price increase yesterday. This situation has left people in a daze. The current market chaos is indescribable. The previous day, due to rumors of a customs ban on exports, people were panicked and the market fell sharply. Yesterday, although customs banned exports, those with "permits" could still pass through, indicating that it was not a complete closure. As long as there is a "permit," customs can release the goods, leaving room for maneuvering. Speculators truly have well-informed sources. The customs had not yet announced the ban, but the news had already leaked out. The bulls' methods are truly ruthless, demanding that the speculators "provide actual goods" for the yarn they sold, which means handing over the warehouse receipts. The speculators, forced into a corner, are crying out in misery. This time, knowing that the speculators are just empty shells, how can they cope with the current shortage of warehouse receipts? The joy of the previous day's limit-down price increase was like a dream yesterday, all in vain. Another limit-up price increase, one up, one down, one up, all coming suddenly. The bulls are also afraid that the speculators will take the opportunity to escape during the price surge, so they take a bold move, taking the opportunity to catch their breath and recover some margin calls. Therefore, today's cotton yarn speculation is like moths flying into a flame.

The market opened lower in the morning due to the panic of the previous day, opening at 1,880 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers flocked in, and the momentum tightened, with prices rising steadily, reaching over 2,000 yuan. However, the exchange price was average, and it returned to 1,950 yuan. Later, the sellers were required to submit warehouse receipts, otherwise they would be punished. The market gradually rose, reaching 1,986 yuan at closing. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 18,000 bales were traded, all by fellow traders, with no participation from guest merchants. In the afternoon, the market opened at 1,995 yuan. Later, there was a move to squeeze warehouse receipts, and the exchange's yarn price rebounded, rising above 1,000 yuan to 2,030 yuan, announcing a limit-up price increase. The highest price of the day was 2,030 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,880 yuan. It is said that the black market continued to see price increases. The inside story is unknown to outsiders.

The Jin Shuang Ma futures market has experienced sharp falls and rises, and the speed of its fluctuations is unprecedented. The catastrophic fall the other day was due to the ban on exports. Now, after the announcement, the yarn market has risen sharply instead. Factory orders have also risen above the limit-up price. The fierce competition between the two sides can be seen from this. At the opening in the morning, the spot market first opened at 1,880 yuan due to margin calls, and then soared to over 2,000 yuan. During that period, the yarn market opened, and the market sentiment turned from weak to strong. The shorts started to float again and made large compensations, while speculators took the opportunity to absorb them, leading to a unanimous price increase. The October contract opened at 1,900 yuan, the November contract also opened at 1,900 yuan, and the December contract initially opened at 1,930 yuan. Afterwards, the price was slightly lower, but the base was very solid. In the afternoon, factory orders continued to soar, reaching as high as 2,030 yuan and reaching the limit-up price. The speed of its changes is truly alarming. Therefore, the futures yarn also followed the upstream, but because the spot market hedged out the futures, it failed to reach the limit-up price. The result of the full-day ups and downs was a unanimous rebound of over 50 to over 80 yuan. A table is listed below. Today is a national holiday, and the market is closed for one day.

### Cheap Foreign Cotton is About to Arrive, Factories are Ordering in Succession

Spot cotton trading is not as lively as it used to be, but those holding goods are still hoarding and unwilling to sell easily. However, with the fluctuating prices of yarn and cloth, people are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, a few trading houses, seeing the sudden surge in bid yarn in the afternoon, seized the opportunity to buy.

Fire Machine Grass Bale 400 bales 480.0 Qing Feng Jin

Lan Gong Hua 100 pieces 520.0 Trading House

Lan Gong Hua 110 pieces 515.0 Trading House

Lan Gong Hua 200 pieces 512.0 Trading House

Lan Gong Hua 100 pieces 510.0 Trading House

Lan Gong Hua 100 pieces 508.0 Trading House

The New York cotton market fell because cotton production statistics were 11,061,000 bales, an increase of 351,000 bales compared to the September report, which was clearly favorable to the shorts. At the same time, due to a large number of longs closing positions and continuous selling by market participants, it fell sharply. Yesterday's closing price was about 29 to 24 points lower than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market fell initially due to the longs closing positions, and then rose due to purchases by brokers and support from large traders. Finally, the market plummeted again due to floating longs selling and general selling. Yesterday's last trading closing price fell by 6 or 7 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market will fall by 1 rupee.

In recent days, foreign cotton trading by foreign firms in Shanghai has been desperate because there is no certainty of obtaining foreign exchange for direct orders of foreign cotton. However, if there are large amounts of liquid funds deposited in local foreign banks that can be used for discounting bills, foreign cotton can still be purchased. Therefore, factories and traders alike believe that ordering foreign cotton is the greatest need at present. This is not only because of the urgent need for goods in this city and the good profits to be made in the future, but also because the source is not easy to obtain. Currently, there is a willingness to sell large quantities at low prices. Whether it is Brazilian cotton or American cotton, those that will arrive in Shanghai at the end of October or the beginning of November are about 200 yuan cheaper than the current spot cotton in this city.

### Finance Gold Prices Soar Amidst Bidding from Various Parties

Yesterday, the black market was again turbulent, and the uptrend resurged. Cash gold was again approaching the 10,000 yuan mark. People's confidence was extremely strong. The black market for foreign exchange tightened again, and spot yarn rebounded sharply. The Hong Kong and Chaozhou gangs and cash gold shops in the market fiercely absorbed gold, rising from 9,650 yuan to 9,950 yuan, a further increase of 350 yuan. After closing, the price rose further to 9,980 yuan with no sellers. More than 1,200 taels were traded. The buying trend for gold futures also started. The Hong Kong and Chaozhou gangs were also absorbing gold, and securities firms were competing to buy. The price rose from 7,680 yuan at the morning opening to 7,830 yuan at the evening close, with over 3,000 taels traded. Gold jewelry also exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark.

Cash Jumps 350 Yuan

Cash gold rebounded strongly, and trading was very active. The price at the opening in the morning was already 100 yuan higher per bar (ten taels). Initially, Xiang Xing, Yong Jin, and Cheng Ji bought 100 taels at 9,700 yuan. Later, Cheng Da, De Cheng, De Da, Shun Yuan, and Heng Ji actively bought, rising 60 yuan. Cheng Ji sold 30 taels from a certain bank and Yong Cheng sold 20 taels for 9,760 yuan. De Fu suddenly sold aggressively, and Xiang He sold 130 taels. Jewelry stores sold slightly, and the price dropped to below 9,700 yuan, a total drop of 110 yuan. Xin Feng Yong sold 10 taels to Zhong Xing and Lian Xing sold 30 taels, falling to 9,651 yuan. Near noon, Xiang Xing and Yong Shun Yuan bought, and the price rebounded 70 yuan to 9,720 yuan at noon closing. In the afternoon, cash gold shop Shi He first bought, and the price immediately rose 80 yuan. They bought 20 taels each from Xiang He and Yong Cheng, and 10 taels from De Fu, for 9,800 yuan. Later, Yong Cheng continued to sell 10 taels from Wan Feng, falling back to 9,780 yuan. He Sheng Lai actively bought 100 taels, rising to 9,900 yuan. De Fu sold aggressively, and Xiang He sold 200 taels, falling back to 9,880 yuan. Shi He and Xiang Xing Yong competed to buy, and Xiang He bought another 50 taels. The price had risen to 9,920 yuan. Finally, Shi He bought 10 taels from Hong Qing Yong for 9,940 yuan, and Cheng Ji bought 20 taels for 9,950 yuan, the last transaction price, a jump of 350 yuan compared to the previous day. There were fluctuations of 300 yuan, and over 1,200 taels were traded. After closing, there was demand but no supply at 9,978 yuan. Gold shops' own brand of gold was sold at retail for over 10,000 yuan, and the purchase price was 200 to 300 yuan lower than the selling price.

Gold Futures Only Rises and Does Not Fall

The opening price of the October contract (ten taels) was still 7,680 yuan at 9:30 AM, the same as the previous day's evening closing price. Later, Tian Yuan, Heng Ji, Yu Xing Yong, Xiang Xing Yong, etc., actively bought, and the market price gradually rose, returning to the 7,700 yuan mark, with fewer sellers. It showed a trend of only rising and not falling, rising 90 yuan and rising directly to 7,770 yuan at noon closing. The market opened at 7,790 yuan at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, another 20 yuan higher. Tian Yuan sold to 7,780 yuan. Later, Xin Feng Yong, Xiang Xing Yong, De Fu, and Ju Feng Yong actively bought, and before the evening closing, the price rose 50 yuan to over 7,800 yuan. The closing price at 4:00 PM was 7,830 yuan, a jump of 150 yuan. There was a difference of 150 yuan that day.

Gold Jewelry Re-Exceeds the 1,000 Yuan Mark

The selling price of gold jewelry in jewelry stores was raised by 10 yuan by Da Tong Xing and Xin Tong Xing at 10:30 AM to 1,000 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it fell back to 990 yuan. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it rose 10 yuan, and at 4:00 PM, it rose another 10 yuan to 1,010 yuan (purchase price reduced by 50 yuan), a jump of 20 yuan.

### Black Market Negotiations Unsuccessful, No Transactions Heard All Day

Yesterday's foreign exchange market showed no changes in the prices quoted by both the Central Bank and HSBC. HSBC's small counter price was stable, and there were many applicants for foreign exchange settlements. The black market for British and American currency was still tightening. Non-essential importers were active at 4.375 yuan and 4.25 yuan, but offers were only available at 4.125 yuan, and the market price was consistently difficult to approach. No transactions were heard all day. The evening closing price was approximately 2 shillings 625 pence for British currency and 4.1875 yuan for American currency, which was unchanged for British currency and 0.0625 yuan tighter for American currency compared to the previous day.

Hong Kong, 9th (Thursday) dispatch: The foreign exchange market opened calmly this morning, with no gains or losses for any currency.

Tianjin, 9th (Thursday) dispatch: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. The London telegraphic transfer and Shanghai telegraphic transfer remained at their original levels. The New York telegraphic transfer eased by 0.125 yuan to 4.875 yuan. Private trading of Joint Reserve Notes was up 0.50 yuan to 46.75 yuan.

### American Currency at Top Price of 51.10 Yuan

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the prices of British and American gold pounds rise 10 yuan each along with the cash gold price. British gold notes also rose 1 yuan. Italian gold notes fell initially but then rebounded sharply, opening at 23.80 yuan and then rising to 25.10 yuan at closing, a sharp increase of 1.10 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes showed a relatively stable trend. Singapore, Canadian, and Philippine notes also tended to rise. Japanese gold notes rose and then leveled off, remaining at their original level of 2.43 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes continued to rise, rising to 2.09 yuan in the evening market.

### Grains Rice Merchants Unwilling to Let Go, Become Active at the Slightest Opportunity

Yesterday's early market for foreign rice was flat and listless, with a strong selling sentiment. Due to the previous day's weak trend, people were still timid. Moreover, the low-price sales were scheduled to start tomorrow at a subsidized price of 110 yuan. Local retail sales were lacking demand, and speculators were also selling. Therefore, the spot price for small-grain rice immediately opened lower from 121 yuan to 119 yuan. Other Saigon rice varieties all showed a unanimous downward trend. However, as soon as the market price dipped slightly, it was immediately noticed by the merchant-controlled rice stocks, and retail merchants also seized the opportunity to inquire. Therefore, the buying sentiment in the noon market was strong, and prices gradually rebounded. The spot price for small-grain rice closed at 120 yuan to 122.50 yuan. The buying sentiment was even stronger in the afternoon, and the evening closing price for small-grain rice had reached 123 yuan. The low prices in the early market, which were 1 to 2 yuan lower than the previous night, were now 1 to 2 yuan higher at the evening closing. The total transaction volume was still 24,500 bags. Ying Hua Si only had 200 to 300 tons.

### Foreign Flour Transported Northward, Market Sentiment Still Excited

The previous market for foreign flour saw the market price decline sharply by nearly one yuan due to profit-taking and negative rumors. Although there was a brief period of consolidation at the opening yesterday morning, the merchant-controlled stocks were actively absorbing at low prices, and retail customers were also replenishing their stocks before the holiday. The buying sentiment in the market was extremely strong, and speculators seized the opportunity to make quick profits, causing the market to rise again. Moreover, rumors were mostly favorable, and market sentiment was even more excited. The opening price for Pao Tai was 37 yuan to 37.10 yuan, and the closing price in the afternoon was 37.20 yuan to 37.60 yuan. The sellers were still trying to raise prices. Shuang Ying was 36.10 yuan, Ren Qiu was 36.78 yuan, and Jin Yu Dong Zhan was 36.13 yuan. The opening price for Xi Zhan in the morning was already 35 yuan, and in the afternoon it rose from 35.40 yuan to 35.75 yuan. The evening closing price for Jin Long saw some floating longs selling, which briefly suppressed the price, but the result was still about one yuan higher than the previous night. In addition to speculation, the actual retail sales were about 10,000 bags. The opening price for both domestic and imported wheat from Du Ke was 55 yuan. However, because the production price was not cheap, the sellers were still trying to raise prices. 3,000 tons of previously arrived Canadian foreign wheat were offered at 71.70 yuan, but there were no inquiries or transactions for deliveries.

The Taikoo Company's Suzhou ship, loaded with a large number of foreign flour bags totaling 40,000 bags, will be transported to Tianjin today. The Yuezhou ship will also go to Tianjin today, as well as to Weihaiwei, also loaded with 2,700 bags of foreign flour and 500 bags of foreign rice to be transported to Qihaiwei.

### Securities Public Bonds Rebound as the Situation Changes

Although the Sichuan gang was still selling spot bonds in the black market yesterday, the absorbers were in a better environment. The recapture of Yichang boosted morale, and the market price did not fall due to the Sichuan gang's selling. On the contrary, it gradually trended upward. After closing, there were favorable rumors, because there was talk of a change in finance, but whether it was true remains to be seen. At the opening yesterday morning, Class C bonds opened at 1 yuan. Xinfu, Xinhua, Xingchang, Yitai, and Jiufeng bought Class C bonds, with the high price reaching 1.05 yuan. Later, Da Zhong, Sheng Da, Bao Long, Hou De, and Tong Kang all sold, and the price fell back slightly to 1.01 yuan at noon closing. Class B bonds once saw a high price of 4 yuan. In the afternoon, Da Zhong, He Feng, Xie Xing, Yuan Heng Kang, etc., bought, while Ren Chang, Lian Yi, Bao Long, Tong Kang, and Hou De continued to sell. The market gradually trended upward, and the momentum gradually strengthened. As a result, the market price uniformly rose by 0.20 yuan to 0.70 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 1.2 million to 1.3 million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below. Today is the Double Tenth Festival, and the market is closed for one day.

Stock Trading: 200 shares of stock exchange stock were traded, with a price of 60 yuan.

The stock market for various industries was extremely volatile, and the prices fluctuated erratically. Market sentiment was weak at the opening, and it only rebounded at noon. Reclamation stocks had the most transactions, opening at 39.50 yuan. After a while, the tide suddenly turned, rising to a high price of 45.50 yuan, and closing at 45.25 yuan. The trend of rubber stocks was uncertain.

Yesterday, Mr. Wu Ruisi said that the numbers converted to the face value of the currency varied greatly, and he did not know why. He mentioned Yihe and other stocks. Checking the conversion to face value means converting the transaction price in legal tender to the same currency as the face value. For example, if the face value is in taels and the transaction price is in yuan, then it is converted to taels using 715. If the face value is in pounds, then the transaction price in legal tender is also converted to pounds. Only in this way can it be compared with the face value currency to see the ups and downs.

A reader named Chao Ran also wrote to request that the internal conditions of each company be listed in detail. This should be sought from first-class organizations such as the Industrial and Commercial Credit Bureau, and this newspaper only publishes based on submissions, and does not have such a large space to publish such cumbersome forms. Perhaps organizations that operate stocks have such documents to meet your needs.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Grain Merchants Play Another Trick Buying and Selling Corn Short Frequent Price Increases for Soybeans

Soybean prices have continued to rise, because the source has often been obstructed, causing general transporters to shrink back. This has led to major hoarders among the owners raising prices substantially. Yesterday, the opening price for Tianjin Xin Jinyuan reached 110 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Other varieties also increased by about 2 yuan each. The total market traded over 400 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, 150 bags of Qingkou soybeans, and 200 bags of Guide soybeans.

Speculative grain merchants are extremely bored. Yesterday, they actually made a big deal out of buying and selling corn short, causing futures trading to be unprecedentedly lively, with prices turning over and over, and they performed their signature good show. Although actual sales are weak and spot prices are stable, they still create waves out of nothing, and the market price was ultimately raised by more than one yuan. The total market traded over 5,000 tons of futures and only 500 bags of spot.

### Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Sales Blocked Everywhere

Factory Cloth: The market fell yesterday because Nanyang and Hong Kong merchants were forced to stop shipping, and the ban on shipments to occupied areas remained strict. Moreover, the number of privately smuggled pieces was small, and the risk was great, so actual sales hit a wall. Only retail shops and wholesalers in this street had some additions. Coarse cloth fell by 1 yuan to 1.50 yuan, twill fell by 1.50 yuan to 2 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth fell by 2 to 3 yuan. The total transaction volume in this street was over 200 pieces, and all merchant sales were halted.

Eastern Cloth: Rising and falling suddenly, people were confused. Futures cloth on the exchange fell by 1 yuan in the current month and rose by 1 to 2 yuan in the distant month. In the spot market, fine cloth rose while fine twill fell. The factory order closing price for 11-pound Longtou fine cloth was 65.80 yuan, an increase of 1.50 yuan. Miscellaneous brand fine twill continued to fall by 0.25 yuan per piece due to sluggish merchant sales. Colored goods and serge turned firm because fine yarn, finishing, dyeing, etc., were all expensive. Traders bought and hoarded, and the rebound was 6 to 7 cents per yard. The closing price for Four Gentlemen's new orders was 2.44 yuan.

Velvet: (Except for wide and narrow camel velvet), recent varieties such as double-sided yellow camel velvet, sea tiger velvet, bear wool velvet, long-haired velvet, short-haired velvet, mohair, lamb velvet, etc., are all in short supply and selling well, and the market prices are uniformly high. However, because the demand from female color gangs is high, the trend is becoming increasingly high. Among the velvet and woolen cloth traders, there are very few who have confirmed deliveries. The production of local factory goods is still in its infancy, resulting in demand exceeding supply. Among them, long-haired sea white dragon velvet is even more expensive because it is not only used for women's coats but also for men's Western-style coats, which are also quite popular and selling well. Yesterday, the price of Three Camel Brand long-haired velvet was 115 yuan per yard, short-haired velvet was 110 yuan, local factory goods were 80 yuan, mohair was 40 yuan, bear wool velvet was 100 yuan, sea tiger velvet was 90 yuan, lamb velvet was 85 yuan, British-made double-sided yellow camel velvet was 75 yuan, and Tianjin Renli goods were 60 yuan.

### The Price of Felt Hats Increases Twentyfold

The drastic rise in the price of felt hats this autumn can be described as unprecedented. Compared to last autumn, the price has increased by three to four times. Currently, the selling price of each felt hat is invariably over twenty yuan. The entire reason for the soaring price is due to one material: wool, which is purely produced in Australia. Since the outbreak of the European war, the source has suddenly become scarce. The Renyi Hat Factory, the only domestically owned enterprise in Shanghai, has also reduced its output due to its limited wool reserves. As a result of supply not meeting demand, the number of those seeking hats has increased, and the price has soared, especially for low-end goods. Before the war, each batch of hat blanks was sold for five or six yuan, but now the market price is around one hundred and ten yuan. As a result of repeated price increases, manufacturers have indeed made considerable profits, but sales are sluggish, and the quantity sold is far from that of the past, which is a hidden worry for the future. (End)

### Sugar Market: Amidst News of Large Shipments to Tianjin, Sugar Prices Fluctuate but Ultimately Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market was initially stable, then tightened, and the momentum returned. The company's futures for No. 24 coarse white sugar, for the October 20th period, opened at 165 yuan in the morning session and closed at 171.40 yuan, with a high of 172.20 yuan and a low of 65 yuan. Outside the market, transactions were at 70.08 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 72.50 yuan and closed at 74.30 yuan, with a high of 76 yuan and a low of 72.50 yuan. Outside the market, transactions were at 73.90 yuan, an increase of 3.90 yuan. The October-end period opened at 170 yuan in the morning session and closed at 73.20 yuan, with a high of 75.60 yuan and a low of 70 yuan. Outside the market, transactions were at 72.80 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 77 yuan and closed at 75.80 yuan, with a high of 77.80 yuan and a low of 75.50 yuan. Outside the market, transactions were at 75.90 yuan. The association's marked price for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar was 170 yuan to 172.50 yuan for September imports, and 74 yuan to 76.50 yuan to 75.50 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 2.50 yuan. August was 169 yuan to 172.50 yuan, and 73 yuan to 74 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 1 yuan. Dutch red sugar was 147 yuan to 150 yuan, and 51 yuan to 52 yuan in the afternoon.

### Metals: Ribbed Steel Bars Are Still Viewed Favorably

In the trade of ribbed steel bars, the construction industry in this area is the primary buyer. In addition, merchants from the northern road also make sporadic purchases. However, they are not many. The overseas supply of this commodity is currently difficult, and the inventory in this port is not abundant, so those in the industry still hold optimistic views. The standard price has been stable and not soft for a long time. Yesterday, the market price for 3/8 and 1/2 inch specifications was 3,250 yuan per ton. 5/8 inch to 1 inch specifications also sold for 3,200 yuan. The market price for 3/8 and 1/2 inch specifications has already risen by 50 yuan compared to the previous market. Other items, such as Double Luck tinplate, packed in 112 sheets per ton, were selling for 800 yuan. Iron from the new steel factory association was selling for 750 yuan per 200 pounds. However, the current spot inventory of iron from the old steel factory association is extremely tight, and those holding the goods have even higher expectations, so the asking price is higher than that of the new goods.

### Coal: Prepared Coal Increases by Another 40 Yuan

The prepared coal from the Lailai Fire Company had a temporary shortage last month, but it has since resumed production and daily shipments. As a result, prices have gradually declined. Recently, the supplier again cited rising bituminous coal prices and related costs as reasons for the price increase. After discussions among the industry, another 40 yuan was added after the holiday, increasing from 520 yuan to 516 yuan per ton. An additional fee is still required for delivery to merchants.

### Seafood: Qilin Seaweed Returns to Stability

The price of Qilin seaweed had previously risen too high, but it has recently eased by several yuan. Yesterday's market price for top-grade Lion Mane Seaweed was 148 yuan, Xilan Seaweed was 139 yuan, Wudun Seaweed was 133 yuan, and the next grade was 128 yuan. The market appears to be stable.

### Sundries: Amidst Talk of Manipulating Various Goods, Daily Necessities Are Also Being Affected

The market situation for daily necessities is tense with buying. This is because amidst the talk of manipulating gold and silk yarn prices, which has caused them to soar, people's expectations are extremely high. Moreover, as factory shipments are not smooth, there are rumors of increased line prices. Various parties are holding firm on prices, and most are adopting a wait-and-see approach. The market is becoming increasingly brisk. Yesterday's market opening saw Beautiful Brand matches rise to a high price of 1,220 yuan per case, Phoenix Brand was 1,170 yuan, and Tree Brand was 1,000 yuan, a daily increase of 130 yuan. Gu Ben soap was 64 yuan per case, Bai Xiangmao soap was 54 yuan, and Huang Xiangmao soap was 50 yuan, all up 2 yuan from the previous day. Whiteley's Sailing Ship candles were 37.50 yuan, with little change. Looking at the overall market price of matches and soap, it is not easy to fall back in the short term.
