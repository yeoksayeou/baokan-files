### Roosevelt's Aid to Democratic Nations Plan: U.S. Congress to Pass with Amendments; Willkie Endorses Granting Power to the President; Will Also Visit England to Inspect War Situation

Washington - President Roosevelt's aid-to-Britain plan is likely to be passed by Congress after amendments. However, the amendments will not hinder the President's plan to aid those resisting aggression. Congressional leaders met yesterday, and the result seems to be the proposal of three amendments, which will be accepted: (1) stipulating that Britain must provide some form of guarantee for the airplanes and ships supplied by the United States, such as mortgaging British interests in the Western Hemisphere and its metal and oil production; (2) limiting the President's powers to a certain period, with a maximum limit of two years; and (3) removing the clause in the aid-to-Britain plan that allows British warships to be repaired in U.S. territorial waters. It is generally believed that the above three articles will not seriously affect the main purpose of this plan. (Reuters, 13th)

New York - President Roosevelt arrived at his Hyde Park villa this morning and is expected to return to Washington tomorrow morning. According to a White House staff member, if members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives express strong opposition to the President's "Aid to Democratic Nations" proposal, he may return to the capital earlier. This morning, the President had several long-distance telephone conversations with leaders of both houses, mainly discussing how to amend the original proposal so that it could be voted on and passed quickly. (Havas, 12th)

Washington - Mr. Willkie, the Republican presidential candidate who previously lost the election to President Roosevelt, said yesterday that he supported President Roosevelt's Aid to Democratic Nations Act, although "some points differ slightly from his own views." He also said that he would fly to England to inspect the war situation, and may depart in two weeks. He stated, "Under the current circumstances, Congress should grant the President extraordinary powers," but added that Congress should limit the duration of the President's expanded powers. Willkie also said that his trip to England had been approved by Secretary of State Hull, and he was willing to talk with anyone there who was willing to meet him. Willkie also directly rebuked Landon, the Republican candidate in 1936, for his remarks on Saturday. Landon stated that the security guarantee of the United States' future did not solely depend on Britain defeating Germany. Willkie said, "In the current war, who wins and who loses is of great importance to the United States. I specifically rebuke the saying that 'the future of our country has nothing to do with Britain's defeat.'" (United Press, 13th)

New York - Willkie stated that he will not go to England for a long time as a U.S. citizen. It is widely believed that the motive for his action is to show Britain that the United States is united and will grant special privileges to Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Act. Prominent Republican senators are currently fiercely criticizing the act, as are Democratic senators. Therefore, Willkie's remarks in favor of Roosevelt's proposal have attracted nationwide attention. Opponents of the plan call it a "streamlined declaration of war" and repeatedly state that this plan will temporarily suspend the democratic government of the United States and make the President a dictator, granting him various powers that will lead the United States into war. Senator Fuller of Wisconsin, a progressive Republican, said, "This is not a bill to grant power to the President, but a bill to abolish Congress." Willkie's support for this bill has caused surprise in many quarters. During the heated debate in the Senate, Democrats on the President's side said that Willkie's views on foreign policy were the same as the President's. Willkie has seen the true meaning of this case, which is to concentrate and accelerate aid to beleaguered Britain. As for Willkie's trip to England, many people believe that he may be carrying a certain mission from the government. (International News Service, 13th)

Washington - Senator Wheeler declared today during a discussion of the American aviation tribunal system that if Congress passes the government's proposal authorizing the President to supply a large number of war materials to various democratic nations, it would be tantamount to the United States openly engaging in full-scale war. (Reuters, 13th)

Tokyo - The local newspapers are extremely concerned about President Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Arms proposal. Today, they all published the news with large headlines. Tokyo's largest Yomiuri Shimbun stated that if the proposal is passed by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Congress, which has the power to declare war and make peace, will openly challenge the Axis powers. Japan should take all kinds of precautions to prevent all possible incidents. Kokumin Shimbun, a newspaper affiliated with the military, compared the United States to someone holding a weapon and urged the government to expand its military to cope with the new situation. It also stated that Japan must build the world's largest fleet and train the world's largest army, including mechanized units, in order to cope with wars on two or three fronts. (Reuters, 13th)

### U.S. Department of Agriculture to Limit Cotton Fields This Year

Washington - Because export markets are almost entirely blocked by the war, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has decided to reduce cotton fields in 1941, further reducing the previous government-set target of 12 million bales of cotton by 1 million bales. The government is willing to supply cotton farmers with cotton cloth worth 15 million yuan. This plan aims to prevent the increase of surplus cotton. Cotton farmers who are willing to cooperate in this way can receive government stamps and use these stamps to exchange for cotton cloth at retail prices from stores. In the future, these stamps will be redeemed by the Ministry of Commerce. (Reuters, 13th)

### Conquered European Nations are Strong Allies of Britain; Resources and Personnel Can Be Supplied Continuously; Another Force Besides the U.S. and Greece

New York - A survey announced today that although the homelands of Poles, French, Norwegians, Dutch, Belgians, and Czechs are under Nazi control, they are making significant efforts to contribute to Britain's resistance. While Britain needs substantial assistance from the United States to achieve final victory, the people of these countries are making significant contributions to Britain in terms of manpower and materials. It is said that if the people of these conquered nations are combined with Greece, Britain actually has seven allied countries. In addition to tens of millions of people serving in the army, navy, and air force, fighting alongside Britain, these allies have contributed all the warships, airplanes, and merchant ships that have not fallen into German hands to Britain to the greatest extent possible. According to an official statement from the British Parliament, allied nations have delivered 9 million tons of ships to Britain, which, after offsetting the 4 million tons lost since the start of the war, is more than enough. Poland's most notable contribution is its airmen, who have shot down no fewer than 300 German aircraft in the Battle of Britain, accounting for 10% of the total German losses in the Battle of Britain. The 303rd Squadron alone had destroyed 120 German aircraft by December 11. Sikorski, the Prime Minister of the Polish government in England, reportedly said in mid-November that the Polish Air Force had been greatly strengthened and that in the past there were only 15 squadrons, each with 320 aircraft and thousands of airmen. In addition, thousands of the 75,000 Poles trapped in France have escaped to Britain. Combined with thousands of Polish volunteers from the United States and Canada, they have now formed a new army to defend northern England. In addition, several Polish naval units, including four destroyers and five submarines, have also joined the British Navy. Czechoslovakia's contribution is an army of several thousand people, which has now been greatly strengthened by the addition of 1.5 million Czechs from North America. In addition, Czechoslovakia has contributed an air force with 800 airmen. One Czech Air Force squadron shot down 38 German aircraft in four weeks, and several other squadrons participated in air raids on Germany. Czech troops have also participated in the British war in East Africa. General de Gaulle, leader of the French National Committee, recently stated that the Free French forces fighting alongside the British army include 35,000 armed soldiers, 1,000 airmen, 20 warships, 60 merchant ships, and many military technicians. De Gaulle also brought about the unity of places like Calais, Chad, and Gabon, allowing Britain to control important areas in central Africa. As for the Netherlands, almost its entire navy, with the exception of one destroyer and one gunboat, was initially dedicated to Britain. The Dutch navy in Europe and the East Indies has seven cruisers, eight destroyers, twelve torpedo boats, twenty-one submarines, and several other warships. Several warships under construction are being built in Britain for completion. In addition to supplying land, sea, and air forces, the Netherlands has also donated funds to Britain to purchase 45 Spitfires and 18 bombers. Norway has contributed a total of 4 million tons of modern merchant ships and tankers. In addition, it has contributed several destroyers, submarines, and other warships that escaped to Britain. Norwegian airmen are being trained in Canada, and a small army is already in Britain. Belgium has an army in England, and the ships of the Belgian Congo, totaling 100,000 tons, are now serving for Britain. As for Greece, which is fighting Italy in Albania, it has contributed an army of 400,000 people, a small but effective air force, and a navy that includes one cruiser, 23 destroyers, several torpedo boats, six submarines, and several auxiliary ships. In addition, it has contributed several strategically important naval and air bases. (United Press, 13th)

### Japanese Espionage Cases: Number of Offenders Increasing

Tokyo - Last year, there were a total of 43 cases, involving 51 people, tried by the Tokyo District Court for violating the Anti-Espionage Law, including one foreigner.

Osaka - Starting today, the 15th, a three-day campaign to prevent sabotage by spies will be implemented here. The purpose is to prevent spies from damaging machinery and other industrial facilities in order to reduce the nation's wartime production capacity. (Reuters, 13th)

### British Air Force Destroys Turin Arsenal in Italy; British Cruiser Reportedly Sunk in Mediterranean Attacks

London - On Saturday, when British Air Force bombers flew to Turin, Italy to attack the Royal Arsenal, the Italian side made a new attempt to obstruct British aircraft traveling between Britain and northern Italy. Anti-aircraft gun teams had been set up on the Italian slopes of the Alps, and they opened fire for the first time. Despite encountering artillery fire and the difficulties of flying over the Alps in winter, British aircraft arrived at their destination in batches shortly after midnight. The sky over Turin was almost cloudless, so British aircraft were able to clearly identify railways, streets, and the Po River. Several British aircraft carried very large bombs, along with many incendiary bombs, and dropped them on the Royal Arsenal like raindrops. They exploded instantly, followed by continuous explosions and rising flames. When the British aircraft flew back over the Alps, they were still able to see the flames of the explosions. One British aircraft, while flying over the Alps, had its bomb release mechanism freeze, preventing it from attacking the arsenal. It continued flying until the mechanism thawed, and then bombed the Fiat factory and another factory. The British aircraft also dropped four-page leaflets with Churchill's recent speech. (Reuters, 13th)

London - Last night, the German Air Force continued its second night of targeting London as its main objective. Bombs fell in various parts of London. British night fighters and anti-aircraft guns engaged the enemy aircraft. It was reported that enemy aircraft had intruded near Liverpool, a city in northeastern England, and a city in western England. It has now been confirmed that in the week ending at midnight on January 11, several German aircraft were shot down in air battles over British territory, and only one British fighter was lost. Another noteworthy fact is that the German side admitted that six German aircraft were lost during the attack on Portsmouth on the night of January 10, while the British side announced that only two German aircraft were shot down. Apparently, the remaining four German aircraft losses were not directly witnessed by the British Air Force. Comparative figures for aircraft losses in the western desert are not yet available. However, noteworthy events in the recent Mediterranean air battles include the confirmed loss of 30 Italian aircraft in the air and at least 8 destroyed on the ground between December 22 and January 5. In the following week, over 100 Italian aircraft were destroyed. On January 6, British aircraft bombed 40 Italian aircraft on the ground at El Agheila, rendering them unusable. On January 8, 12 Italian aircraft were bombed and destroyed on the ground at Benina. On January 9, five Italian bombers were destroyed in Malta. Only two aircraft on the ground at Gavieru and several Italian aircraft in the Bardia area were also destroyed. Since January 5, two Savoia Italian aircraft at Nothuba, two at Gazala, and seven at El Adem have also been destroyed. Furthermore, the vanguard of the British army discovered 35 Italian aircraft that had already been destroyed at Gazala. (Reuters, 13th)

Rome - The Italian High Command here announced yesterday that an Italian-British fleet engagement occurred in the Mediterranean, resulting in the sinking of one British cruiser and the severe damage of one destroyer. The official report stated that the Italian victory in this naval battle was quite significant and that one British large destroyer was directly hit. Officials continued, stating that German warplanes bombed two British fleets in the central Mediterranean, and one British Birmingham-class cruiser was hit in several places. (International News Service, 13th)

Berlin - The German military report this afternoon stated that German aircraft flew to England yesterday for reconnaissance. Last night, the German elite air force bombed military facilities in London. Large fires broke out on both the north and south banks of the Thames River and in the southeastern district of the capital. Military facilities on the southern coast of England were also bombed. Yesterday at noon, enemy aircraft attempted to fly over the German-occupied area, and two were shot down by anti-aircraft guns and one was shot down by a fighter. In total, four enemy aircraft were lost yesterday. This morning, enemy aircraft attacked southern Germany. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Berlin - A military correspondent released the following supplementary battle report to a reporter from Haitong News Agency, stating that the first successful activity of German aircraft in the Mediterranean was seen in yesterday's battle report. At that time, German aircraft had dropped bombs and hit British ships. The British fleet between Port Said and Gibraltar must now contend with aircraft from both Germany and Italy. One of the two merchant ships sunk in yesterday's battle report, weighing 8,000 tons, sank west of Ireland, and the other sank off the east coast of England. British official reports also stated that southeastern England had been attacked by German aircraft. (Haitong News Agency, 13th)

Berlin - Today, an official German communication mentioned that British aircraft attacked German patrol ships in the North Sea, stating that the British aircraft dropped bombs and torpedoes but were ultimately driven away by anti-aircraft fire. The communication also stated that German cruisers and harbor protection ships in the Strait were also attacked by British forces, but were repelled, and two Hurricane aircraft were shot down. (Reuters, 13th)

Rome - A battle report released here last night stated that Italian aircraft carried out reconnaissance flights all day on Saturday in the southeastern and central Mediterranean.

In North Africa, Italian aircraft carried out several night attacks, bombing army concentration camps in the Garah area and reconnoitering enemy positions in Egypt and military camps in Sudan.

### Improvement of Japanese-Soviet Relations Has Become a Bubble

Tokyo - The Central Commercial News published an editorial today, asking the government to take necessary steps to correct the current situation because the people are currently groping in the dark regarding the state of Japanese-Soviet relations. As for British-Japanese relations and American-Japanese relations, the people can still guess and ascertain the truth, but regarding the Soviet Union, very little information is obtained, so they are ignorant of the truth. Everyone knows that the fishery negotiations between the two countries could have been concluded at the end of last month, but now there is no news, making it impossible to understand the actual situation. It also said that we thought that after the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, Japanese-Soviet relations could be expected to become clearer, but it has now become a bubble. (Reuters, 13th)

Editorial

### The Contrast Between the U.S. and Japan

Yesterday, there were two overseas dispatches that can be taken as a very interesting contrast. The first, from Washington, stated that Mr. Willkie, the Republican presidential candidate who previously lost the election to President Roosevelt, announced yesterday that he supported Roosevelt's Aid to Democratic Nations Act. He also said that under the current circumstances, Congress should grant the President extraordinary powers. He added that his trip abroad was happily preceded by soliciting the consent of his political opponent. The second, from Tokyo, stated that a certain Japanese magazine with a wide circulation recently used "Do You Know the Meaning of the New Structure?" as a question to solicit responses from readers, and the majority of people answered that they did not know what the new structure meant. It turns out that it is not surprising that businessmen are completely ignorant of this, but the majority of people also included civil servants, teachers, students, and other types of people. The magazine considers this a very noteworthy fact. Judging from the content of these two dispatches themselves, they can be said to be completely unrelated. However, based on these two dispatches, if we try to explore the fundamental political systems and national characters of the U.S. and Japan, we can obtain fresh and practical information on a major issue in the trend of the times.

Germany and Italy, in their current laws, political systems, and in reality, are completely totalitarian states. As for Japan, although its constitution has never been regarded as a normal democratic polity from the beginning, its application over the decades, following the example of Britain, has been quite successful. Its parliament and political parties' deliberation and decision-making have become a source of political power and a repository of authority. If it had adhered to the model and evolved gradually, it should have been listed among the democratic nations. However, the unprovoked initiation of the September 18th Incident ten years ago ultimately led to a state of undeclared war against China. During this period, it repeatedly staged political tragedies, so the source of its political power and authority has, in fact, shifted into the hands of the military. Last summer, when Konoe was re-appointed as Prime Minister, he called for a new structure and made many changes. Thus, the situation of the military in power took a step further and gradually entered a stage of "legalization" and "institutionalization." Now it is a totalitarian state that is not yet fully mature, and it is aspiring to and striving for this model in the hope of maturing as soon as possible. From a certain perspective, to examine the fundamental consciousness of the three totalitarian states of Germany, Italy, and Japan, one can take their faded anti-communist pact, which was aimed at the Soviet Union, as a symbol. However, in terms of the logic of the current stage, the so-called totalitarian state has become a clear opposition to the democratic state. For ten years, the totalitarian states have been promoting their totalitarian political systems and theories with their unique logic, and using ridicule of democracy as negative material. On the one hand, they have been implementing aggression by force, emphasizing their totalitarian political systems and theories through the progress of aggression, and the various "disappointments" of the democratic international (?) have provided them with excellent material, either in small or large quantities. Politics is originally a matter of fact rather than theory. Therefore, although democracy has been embraced by the vast majority of humanity for a century, and it is theoretically and in the political systems of various countries stated that democracy should be the normal foundation of the nation and the basis of political power in modern states, in fact, it has suffered from the turbulence of the past ten years, leading to the appearance of this ebb and flow between democracy and totalitarianism. Faced with this ebb and flow, people who uphold democracy can only smile bitterly and feel threatened. When France was defeated, collapsed, and surrendered in the European war last summer, Germany achieved a victory that was close to surpassing what wisdom could imagine. At that time, it seemed that there was a political classroom where the totalitarian teacher was whipping the democratic students, and also lecturing the students: This is the truth!

"Politics is originally a matter of fact rather than theory." The truth of democracy can be proclaimed for thousands of years, but the facts of the past ten years have rebelled, almost making democracy not only unable to sit high on the throne of truth, but also shaking or even overturning the existing democracy. Since the facts and theories are so far apart, it almost makes the majority of humanity restless and unsure of where to settle. However, truth is, after all, truth. All perversions must have a factual limit, and all truths will eventually be explained by facts. After the madness of the perversion, there are facts like these: France was defeated, but Britain was not, showing that democratic nations are not necessarily defeated. Germany is strong, but Italy is not, showing that totalitarian states are not necessarily strong. This at least asserts that the strength and weakness of a nation has nothing to do with democracy or totalitarianism, and at least breaks the superstition of totalitarianism. The facts under the truth do not stop there. In Japan: they have deployed their entire nation's army and decades of savings to wage an undeclared war against China, and their entire people can hardly find a satisfactory and appropriate word to express what they can truly acknowledge as the meaning and purpose of the war against China, unless it is the new order mentioned in the phrasebook. Konoe has the support of the military, holds great power, and devotes his full strength to creating the so-called new structure. Recently, a certain magazine revealed the confusion of the Japanese intellectual class and even the majority of people regarding the new structure. These facts may be explained by the fact that the totalitarian political system is based on the spirit that the people can be made to follow, but cannot be made to understand. However, the training of the entire people that totalitarianism touts, to make them understand, to make them sincerely convinced and work together with the entire nation, has been exposed by a certain magazine. On the other hand, what is the atmosphere of democracy? In the United States, under democracy, there is a two-party opposition, and the current policy and the current president are based on the Democratic Party. However, Willkie, the Republican who lost the presidential election, frankly supports the national policy set by his political opponent, advocates that his political opponent obtain greater power, and happily seeks the consent of his political opponent before traveling abroad. This kind of atmosphere makes one wonder where the reasons lie for totalitarianism, such as Germany and Italy, not allowing the existence of multiple parties and insisting on one party and one party member, and for totalitarianism, such as Japan, striving to destroy all parties and advocating no party as governance. Conversely, the facts of universal understanding and universal cooperation are not in totalitarian Japan but in democratic America! To what extent can a country that can be made to follow but cannot be made to understand create strength, and to what extent can a country with universal understanding and universal cooperation create strength? Comparing the two, it can be asserted that the achievements will ultimately be vastly different. And the fact that the entire United States has become an arsenal, becoming an arsenal for anti-aggression democratic nations, is seen as possible at present, and will be seen as a reality in the future. This is the convergence of fact and theory, and this is the truth of democracy!

Two Thai planes were shot down. On the same day, Thai planes bombed Tay Ninh and Savannakhet. The extent of the damage is unknown. (Dispatch of the 13th, United Press)

Hanoi: According to a communiqué from the Vietnamese Governor-General's Office today, two Thai planes that bombed Siem Reap on the 10th of this month were set on fire and crashed by French fighter planes. French planes are active in attacking various parts of Thailand and the railway from Aranyaprathet to Bangkok. The Governor-General categorically denies reports that French planes attempted to bomb Bangkok on the 10th of this month. (Dispatch of the 13th, Reuters)

Hanoi: According to a message issued by the Thai capital's radio station, three French planes bombed the city on the 10th of this month. Officials here recently issued a communiqué, vehemently denying this and saying that such propaganda is purely fabricated. The French planes only bombed some key cities on that day, purely as a retaliatory measure for the Thai planes bombing Vietnam. As for Bangkok's threat to bomb Saigon and Phnom Penh (the capital of Cambodia), it is not taken seriously here. If that country recklessly carries out its threat, French planes will immediately and fiercely bomb Bangkok in retaliation. In short, the Vietnamese government has no intention of challenging Thailand, and is willing to fulfill the non-aggression pact signed by both sides. As soon as Thailand stops its acts of aggression, Vietnamese troops will stop retaliatory actions. (Dispatch of the 12th, Havas)

Bangkok: A public announcement here today stated that Thai troops, under the cover of aircraft, continue to advance across the Vietnamese border. Thai troops have continued to make gains in eastern Cambodia. After fierce fighting yesterday, the French army has retreated and abandoned military supplies, equipment, and many corpses of French and Vietnamese soldiers. (Dispatch of the 13th, Reuters)

Chongqing: According to a report in Ta Kung Pao, as a result of Japan's assistance to Thailand in the recent Thai-Vietnamese war, friction between the Japanese and Vietnamese authorities is increasing. The Vietnamese authorities have suspended the right of Japanese people to use the Lao Cai Airport in northern Vietnam. According to a telegram from the London correspondent of the Central News Agency, the British attitude towards the Thai-Vietnamese war is: (1) to maintain friendly relations between Britain and Thailand, (2) to regret the deterioration of British-Vietnamese relations, and (3) to hope that Thailand and Vietnam will achieve a peaceful resolution, because Britain does not want war to occur in areas approaching Singapore.

### Fujian Provincial Government Vigorously Implements Food Management Policy

Public Purchase Bureaus Established in All Counties Next Month; 600 Trained District Chiefs to Serve as Managers of Public Purchase Bureaus

Fuzhou: Food management in Fujian Province is now being extended from Yong'an and Nanping to Fuzhou and Jian'ou. Food for the residents of the two cities is already widely supplied by the Public Purchase Bureaus. Residents can register with the Public Purchase Bureaus based on their household registration and rice purchase certificates, and retail stores that distribute rice purchase rice at the set price. In Fuzhou, one yuan can buy two and a half jin, and in Jian'ou, four jin and twelve liang. The supply situation in Jian'ou is particularly stable. Although food management has not yet been widely implemented in southern Fujian, the recent government adjustment of supply and demand has lowered prices. Quanzhou lacked more than 100,000 shi in the first half of the year, and neighboring rice-producing counties have been designated to supply it. The county prepares the price and purchases and transports it at 28 yuan per 100 jin for distribution and sale. Zhangzhou is also implementing price stabilization sales. Around the New Year, the price of rice fell to more than ten yuan per shi. In order to vigorously implement the food management policy, the provincial government has specifically designated this year as the Food Management Year. This month, more than 600 outstanding district chiefs from various counties will be selected and trained before being assigned to serve as deputy managers of the Public Purchase Bureaus in various counties. Starting next month, the secretaries of the Food Management Committees in various counties and the Public Purchase Bureaus in various counties will be widely established. All counties in the province are now ordered to hold a Food Management Propaganda Week, with the rural masses as the main target of propaganda, and especially mobilizing rural Baojia to publicize widely, so that they understand the meaning of food management. The Provincial Food General Management Office will be renamed the Food Management Bureau from New Year's Day, and the Public Purchase General Bureau will be renamed the General Management Office of the Public Purchase Bureau, and will be transferred to the Food Management Bureau to comply with the new system set by the central government.

Moscow: At 6:30 this morning, citizens of the new Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as the people of the Izmail and Cernăuţi regions of the Ukrainian Moldavian Republic, began to elect deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. There are a total of one hundred and thirty-six candidates in the new republics. According to reports from various sources, the election is being conducted in a heated atmosphere. Countless people gathered at the polling stations, all of whom understand their civic duties. In the Kshenev electoral district, Stalin is the first candidate. A voter, Ms. Durashenko, said, "Today we are voting for the Bolshevik Party and Stalin, because the Party and Stalin have given us a new life. In fact, we are voting for the Soviet regime and happiness." As a result, 92.2% of voters participated in the vote. In addition, the election situation in the Cernăuţi region is also extremely active. Some towns, such as Kanye Ting, have already concluded their election activities. (Dispatch of the 13th, TASS)

### Soviet Union Orders Reorganization of Industry

Moscow: The Soviet government yesterday ordered a major reorganization of Russian industry to expand the production of food and consumer goods. The Soviet industry that produces food and consumer goods will be strictly decentralized by order of Stalin and Molotov. The new procedure stipulates that hundreds of small and medium-sized factories should be established throughout the country. The location and equipment for their establishment should depend on the availability of raw materials produced in the area, thus avoiding transportation, trading, and exchange. Under this long-term production program, the Soviet Union will mobilize all local resources to achieve maximum economic benefits. (Dispatch of the 13th, International News Service)

### Small and Medium-Sized Factories Established Throughout the Soviet Union to Meet Local Needs

Moscow: The Soviet government recently issued an order signed by Stalin and Foreign Commissar Molotov, deconcentrating food and other industries, and establishing small and medium-sized factories across the country that utilize local raw materials. Under the current centralized planning system, local benefits have been neglected, resulting in a shortage of necessary goods. (Dispatch of the 13th, Reuters)

### Japan Determined to Maintain Shipping Services to the United States; Will Not Abandon Them Until the Last Possible Moment

Tokyo: The Yomiuri Shimbun recently published a speech by Murata, in which he stated that even if the shipping situation continues to worsen, we are prepared. However, we must maintain the North American shipping route at any cost, in order to retain our rights and, if necessary, to transport Japanese residents out of dangerous areas. I believe that even if Japanese-American relations continue to deteriorate, the U.S. government will not detain Japanese merchant ships docked in U.S. ports. In short, even if Japanese-American trade continues to decrease, shipping services to the United States will not be abandoned until the last possible moment. In this regard, the government has prepared for both the evacuation of overseas residents and the alteration of shipping routes, and is now studying various emergency measures to be implemented if Japanese merchant ships are unable to sail to the west coast of the United States.

### Public Confused About Meaning of New Japanese Structure; Magazine Seeks Opinions; 90% Unaware

Tokyo: A popular magazine sought opinions from readers on the question, "Do you understand the meaning of the new structure?" Based on the replies received, the magazine concluded that the majority of the Japanese people are completely unaware of the meaning of the "new structure" recently created by Japanese leaders. Nine out of ten replies stated that they did not know the meaning of the new structure, and no writer, journalist, or magazine editor has written an article explaining that they understand what the "new structure" is. According to the magazine's criticism, this is a noteworthy fact, and the majority of people who have received a considerable education, including civil servants and students, are among those who are completely unaware of the new structure. Merchants, who are dissatisfied with various control measures, are also naturally among those who are "unaware." More than half of the replies expressed the opinion that the meaning of the new structure is difficult to understand. (Dispatch of the 13th, Reuters)

broadcasted. Filov reiterated Bulgaria's policy of peace and neutrality and of revising treaties by peaceful means, and expressed sympathy for the Axis powers and their new European order. However, he cautiously avoided mentioning the possibility of German intervention in Bulgarian affairs. He said that although Bulgaria hoped for peace, it might have to go through a tragic period. The issue of war and peace did not rest with small countries. The great changes caused by President Roosevelt's words and decisions might lead to a world war. Bulgaria must be cautious, because what we need to know is not only who will win, but also how to achieve victory. We know that there will be a new Europe after the war, and Bulgaria and other countries will be affected by it. Therefore, Bulgaria must remain calm and impartial. We must not be pro-German or pro-British, but be prepared to sacrifice everything for Bulgaria. The government's policy has always been peace, but it also advocates treaty revision. We have wanted to revise the treaties from the beginning, and we still demand to do so by peaceful means. Romania has already ceded Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government firmly believes that it can go further along this path. The Bulgarian government hopes that other injustices can be corrected. Filov asked the people to remain calm and prepare for unforeseen events. He also said that it is Bulgaria's duty to defend its essential interests and deal with any eventuality. Finally, he said that Nazi or communist regimes are not suitable for Bulgaria. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)

Sofia. Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov said yesterday in Rusmik, near the Romanian border, that as a result of President Roosevelt's promise to do his best to help Britain, war will threaten the whole world. Filov said that Bulgaria is in the middle of German and Turkish troop concentrations, but has decided to defend its rights and freedoms by force if necessary. He said that the biggest goal of Bulgaria's foreign policy is to avoid war. He would reportedly meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Vienna. Filov told the people that unless they were willing to "fall into slavery," they should be ready to fight at any time. The speech included friendly tones toward the "powerful nations" of Germany and Italy, which is noteworthy. Regarding the remarks involving President Roosevelt's procedures, it is generally believed that they are not unfriendly to the United States, but merely a statement of fact, saying that American aid is enough to prolong the war, and Bulgaria may eventually be dragged into the war.

Bulgarian newspapers believe that the newly revised Soviet-German commercial treaty is a response to President Roosevelt's decision to aid Britain, and they feel that the strengthening of Soviet-German relations is not only very beneficial to the maintenance of peace in the Balkans, but also helps Bulgaria to realize its demand for treaty revision by peaceful means, which holds that it should "start with Western Thrace first." According to the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, Western Thrace, except for Karagach, was ceded to Greece. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)

### French Commentary on Soviet-German Relations

Vichy. Observers here have recently commented on the expansion of the original economic agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union, stating briefly that the establishment of the new economic agreement has dispelled rumors that friction has occurred between Germany and the Soviet Union recently. Although this agreement is of a technical nature, the large increase in the volume of trade between the two parties in the coming year is sufficient to show that the policy adopted by the Soviet Union when it signed the non-aggression treaty with Germany in August of the previous year will continue to be implemented as always. The agreement on the migration of overseas Chinese further proves that each other recognizes that the current borders have a definite nature. The only outstanding issue at present is the navigation problem in the lower reaches of the Danube River, because the Soviet government has always demanded to jointly control the mouth of the river with Romania. However, since the overall relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union is very good, it is expected that this outstanding issue will not cause much difficulty. In terms of the situation in the Balkans, rumors have been rife in the past week, and people's minds have been restless. It was even rumored that German troops had entered Bulgaria on Wednesday of last week, but this was not the case. Therefore, people's minds have obviously become calmer. For example, according to news from the capital of Yugoslavia, the people of that country are very calm and view the various rumors spread by foreign radio stations with a skeptical attitude. Since the outbreak of the European War in September 1939, such rumors have occurred repeatedly, and each time they have proved to be fabricated. In short, the countries of Southeastern Europe have great confidence in Germany's repeated assurances that the Balkan Peninsula must maintain peace, and believe that the country will continue to devote itself to the completion of the Balkan economic organization, because this is in the country's interest. The country's attitude in the past sixteen months is sufficient proof. As for the reason why the country has strengthened its military situation within Romania, the main reason is to prevent the crises that the Italian-Greek war may directly or indirectly cause. (Havas telegram from the 12th)

Vichy. The economic agreement signed by Germany and the Soviet Union a few days ago was recently commented on by "Le Temps," which believes that the Soviet Union has provided part of its natural resources for use by Germany. The article said: "The relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union is still developing in accordance with the non-aggression treaty signed by the two parties in August 1939. This is beyond doubt. At this moment, the Soviet Union is providing Germany with powerful economic assistance, and the recent agreement signed by the two parties will greatly expand the scope of economic cooperation between the two countries. This is also a fact that is obvious to all. Recalling August 1939, people often thought that due to technical reasons, the Soviet Union might not be able to provide Germany with the economic assistance that it expected, but today the Soviet Union has obviously provided part of its natural resources for use by Germany. This matter is of great importance to Germany's economic situation, especially at a time when the current European war is gradually evolving into a war of attrition." (Havas telegram from the 12th)

### Yugoslavia's Policy Remains Unchanged, But the Cabinet Will Be Reorganized

Belgrade. Last night, well-informed sources said that the Yugoslav cabinet will be reorganized in the next day or two, but the government's domestic and foreign policies will not change.

Yugoslavia felt quite tense in view of Prime Minister Filov's upcoming speech, but it has now greatly eased, because Filov's speech did not mention Bulgaria's territorial demands, but only repeated the speeches of other Bulgarian politicians in the past.

Istanbul. A senior official of the Turkish government said that if German troops cross Romania and enter Bulgaria, Turkey should declare war. He also said that the attempt of the German divisions currently concentrated in Romania may be revealed in the next two weeks. The Germans' attempt is nothing more than the following three: (1) exert pressure on or even attack the Soviet Union; (2) attack Turkey and simultaneously attack Greece; (3) only protect the Romanian oil fields to prevent internal disturbances in Romania or British bombing of the oil fields.

### British and Australian Troops Concentrate to Attack. The Fall of Tobruk is Imminent.

About one division of Italian troops is isolated. Italy abandons air bases in eastern Libya.

Cairo. It is widely believed that the fall of Tobruk will happen soon. According to the latest news, a large number of British and Australian troops, heavy artillery, and tanks are now rapidly concentrating on the city in preparation for the final attack. Today, British artillery shelled the besieged city non-stop throughout the day. The water wells of the Italian garrison were also the target of shelling. At the same time, British fighter and bomber squadrons have destroyed all Italian air force bases within 70 miles of Tobruk. Although the main action of the British army a few days ago was to continue to concentrate around Tobruk, it is reported that another Italian army column, the strength of one division, has been isolated in the fertile land of Qirab al-Ba'shan, 150 miles south of Bardia. The area is close to the Egyptian border, and the surrender of the Italian army is only a matter of time. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)

Cairo. A British Middle East Air Force communique announced that the Italians have abandoned the airfields in eastern Libya and that British aircraft have launched fierce attacks on various airfields and other targets to the west. It is said that British fighter patrols in eastern Libya have discovered that in Derna, Martuba, El Tmimi, and Gazala, there are only a large number of unserviceable Italian aircraft and no aircraft that can fight. On January 10, the British Air Force raided the Benina and Berka airfields at night, and large fires and explosions broke out near the aircraft parked in the field. Benghazi was also attacked, and ships have been badly damaged. On January 9, a British fighter squadron destroyed three Italian aircraft. Two more Italian aircraft were shot down while attempting to land in Derna on the same day. Another three Italian aircraft were shot down in aerial combat. The enemy also seems to have abandoned its seaplane base in Bomba. The British Naval Air Arm attacked Bardia, hitting one ship with one bomb. Another four ships were also damaged. Bombs hit warehouses, causing fires and explosions. The Caproni factory and gasoline depot in Maiadaqa, Italian East Africa, and the Papila area were all attacked by British aircraft. None of the British aircraft that flew out for attacks and reconnaissance were lost. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)

Cairo. According to a British military headquarters communique this morning, yesterday's fierce air raids were a special feature of the British army's preparations for the final attack on Tobruk. It also said that the British Air Force imitated the same strategy as the capture of Bardia, dropping several tons of high-explosive and incendiary bombs on airfields and military bases along the Italian coast throughout Libya. At the same time, British mechanized units launched forward assaults and obtained several important positions between Tobruk and another base in Derna. Military sources said that the purpose of the joint land and air attacks was to paralyze the Italian air defense, cut off reinforcements from entering Tobruk, and make it impossible for the Italian army to retreat.

Italian War Report

Rome. According to the Italian military headquarters, artillery battles and reconnaissance activities continued on the Greek front. Italian aircraft bombed and strafed enemy troops.

Enemy aircraft bombed various parts of Cyrenaica without casualties. Italian aircraft hit a giant ship in the western Mediterranean. In East Africa, enemy troops attacked on the Sudanese front and have been repelled. The Italian army, assisted by artillery, severely damaged the enemy troops. Italian aircraft also bombed enemy troop positions and vehicles in various parts of Sudan. Enemy aircraft attacked Turin last night, causing considerable damage and injuring several people. Enemy aircraft bombed Venice, causing slight damage and injuring several people, killing one person. Catania was also bombed without casualties, and one enemy aircraft was shot down. One enemy aircraft was also shot down in Venice, and six pilots were captured. (Haitong News Agency telegram from the 13th)

### Italian Commander-in-Chief in Albania, General Soddu, Resigns. Greek Troops Have Crossed Këlcyrë. It is rumored that Italy and Greece will reach an understanding.

Rome. General Soddu, the Italian commander-in-chief in Albania, has asked for leave due to ill health. The current Italian Chief of General Staff, Cavallero, has been ordered to command Italian military operations in Albania. (Haitong Telegram)

London. The news of the resignation of General Soddu, the Italian commander-in-chief in Albania, was released in Rome at noon today. Soddu is the third person to resign after attempting to stop the advance of Greek troops without success. Although the announcement of the resignation stated that Soddu had resigned due to illness, it is still unknown whether this is true or whether Mussolini dismissed him due to the continued defeat of the Italian army in Albania. It is reported that his vacant position will be concurrently held by Italian Chief of Staff General Cavallero. The main reason for this approach is that Mussolini has no one else to send due to the recent successive resignations of a large number of Italian military leaders. It is said that Cavallero was not well-known in military circles when he took over as Chief of Staff after General Badoglio, and his experience in military operations is far less rich than in political affairs. Therefore, it has been decided to appoint him to command the combat troops, and the results will be quite noteworthy. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)

London. According to today's news, Greek troops continued to advance northwest of Këlcyrë. Although the distance is not very great, the military significance is quite significant, because Greek troops have crossed Këlcyrë and are advancing along the road to Tepelenë. Although one Italian division recently arrived in Tepelenë to reinforce it, its position is still extremely precarious. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)

Athens. A Greek communique said that Greek troops carried out limited reconnaissance and artillery activities in Albania and captured a number of Italian soldiers. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)

Struga. A large Italian mechanized convoy recaptured the town of Dolzaj yesterday. The town is located on the road from Tepelenë to Delvinë, 14 miles northwest of Tepelenë. Nine British and Greek aircraft bombed the key port of Durrës in Albania yesterday, damaging the docks there and burning one Italian ship in the port. When the squadron flew back to Greece, it bombed the Italian airfield in Elbasan along the way. One Greek aircraft was shot down in this operation. (United Press telegram from the 13th)

Belgrade. German sources here have recently spread a message saying that Greece and Italy are about to reach an understanding and stop the war in Albania, because German troops are reportedly concentrated in the Danube River area within Romania, facing Bulgaria. Political circles here have heard the news from the German side, and they say that the concentration of German troops in the area opposite Bulgaria may constitute a kind of threat, so that Germany can exert diplomatic pressure on Athens.

### Panama Considers Adopting a New Constitution. The full text has 189 articles.

Washington. The Republic of Panama, located at the "crossroads" of the world, is currently considering adopting a new constitution. Copies of the original text of the constitution have been sent to the United States and other countries in the Americas and are being closely studied by constitutional experts. However, these studies are purely academic. One of the twenty-one requirements of this new constitution is to change the term of office of the President of the Republic of Panama from four years to six years. There is also a provisional clause that, if adopted, would extend the term of President Arias, who took office on October 1, 1940, to February 15, 1947, comparing him to the President who was elected in mid-June 1940 and whose term of office was extended by two years and five and a half months. This new constitution, which has one hundred and eighty-nine articles from the first article onwards, has been personally submitted by President Arias to the National Assembly and is intended to replace the constitution adopted on February 13, 1904, after Panama seceded from Colombia. The original constitution stipulated that the President could not be elected for a second consecutive term, but under this new draft constitution, President Arias would also not be allowed to be immediately re-elected after his original term expired, but would be allowed to return to office after the term of another president in the middle expired. This provision also prohibits the re-election of the president. The second article of this new constitution also has some overtones of rejecting individual freedom and advocating power. The meaning of this article is quite different from the theories of Montesquieu, the American constitution, and other constitutions that advocate popular sovereignty. This new Panamanian constitution states that the power of the public is in the state and is exercised by the state in accordance with the methods of the constitution. The Congress has thirty members, each representing 20,000 residents. It convenes an ordinary meeting every two years on New Year's Day and adjourns after four months. Article 72 of the new constitution also stipulates that the President may convene Congress to hold special meetings, but can only discuss matters proposed by the President. The President and cabinet officials may speak in Congress, and cabinet officials should answer questions when asked by members of Congress. Cabinet officials may also hold the position of members of Congress. The new constitution also stipulates that Congress may temporarily allow the President special privileges to deal with special purposes. This privilege can be exercised if it is passed by a majority of the committee organized by representatives in Congress. The new constitution also has some interesting provisions regarding the issues of nationality and racial naturalization. Anyone born in Panama, if their parents are not of a foreign race, is a Panamanian national. Also, any people whose parents are one foreign race and one Panamanian are also Panamanian nationals. Children born abroad, if their parents were born in Panama, are also Panamanians, the same as those born before November 3, 1903 in the territory that is now Panama, but which was not then separated from Colombia. The constitution also has provisions for immigration. All blacks, yellows, and races from India, Asia Minor, and North Africa whose languages are not Castilian are classified as "prohibited from immigration." The naturalization of people is permitted by the President. Anyone who has resided in Panama for more than five years, or who has resided for more than three years and has children of Panamanian nationality, or who has resided for more than two years and is married to a Panamanian, may be naturalized as a Panamanian national. In addition to the original constitution, foreigners must reside in Panama for more than ten years, or for more than three years and marry a Panamanian before they can be naturalized. Article 44 of the new legal code stipulates public collection methods. Any land collected by the state for public use should have judicial rulings and fair debts should be prepaid, but in the event of war, disturbances of public order, epidemics, natural disasters, and other emergencies, the government may expropriate without compensation. The state is responsible for the collection actions implemented by the executive department. Article 142 stipulates that cultivating the land is the landlord's duty to society and can be managed by the state. The new constitution also stipulates the abolition of the death penalty and respect for the law of habeas corpus. If any people believe that the treatment they have received from government officials is unconstitutional, they may request an edict to grant such people the protection permitted by the constitution.

Australian Prime Minister Menzies' planned visit to London and the British side's proposal that the United States can use Singapore at any time and in any way "to promote American purposes or protect its own interests in the South Pacific" when British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Halifax recently met with U.S. Special Envoy to Britain Hopkins have aroused attention in Tokyo. It is believed that the reasonable development of Menzies' trip will be the establishment of an anti-Japanese front by Britain, the United States, and Australia in the South Pacific. Responsible persons recalled that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka told foreign journalists on December 9 last year that this possible event would cause Japan to be extremely concerned. Regarding the reported confiscation of money and documents from several Japanese passengers on an American ship that arrived in Bermuda, the Japanese side has sent a note to the British side, and the British Embassy here and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs are waiting for a reply from London. (North China Daily News telegram from the 11th)

Tokyo. According to Japanese sources in Singapore, Australian Army Minister Spender arrived in Singapore on Saturday after inspecting Australian and New Zealand troops in India, Egypt, and Palestine. He recently broadcasted in the area, saying that Australia has no disputes with Japan, and hopes that the Pacific can live up to its name. We have been neighbors for a long time, and it would be a great misfortune if there were any major misunderstandings. I only hope that the Japanese people will recognize the existence of friendly relations, which will be in the interests of both parties. He also praised the achievements of the Australian army in the Libyan desert. During his visit to Singapore, he met with Air Chief Marshal Brooke-Popham, commander-in-chief of the British Far East forces. (Reuters telegram from the 13th)

### Li Hsi's Mission to France and Nomura's Mission to the United States

U.S.'s newly appointed ambassador to France, Li Hsi, and Japan's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Nomura, are both admirals. This coincidence is rare in the history of international diplomacy and carries particularly profound significance. The New York Times' report is translated as follows:

President Roosevelt's transfer of Admiral Li Hsi, the Governor of Puerto Rico, to be the ambassador to France was first announced to the press by the President's Secretary, Hassett. Although he was unwilling to elaborate, he stated that Admiral Li Hsi has many years of naval experience, is skilled in defensive strategies, and is deeply valued by the President. He was particularly relied upon by the President when he served as Chief of Naval Operations.

President Roosevelt initially considered General Pershing, a distinguished figure in the army, for the position of ambassador to France. General Pershing had a very close relationship with Marshal Petain, the current French Head of State, during the last European war, and was therefore considered for the position. However, General Pershing declined due to his doctor's advice, and the President then appointed Li Hsi to this difficult task.

Since the outbreak of the European war, most of the U.S. ambassadors to European countries, except for Ambassador Steinhardt in the Soviet Union, have returned home one after another. After Li Hsi's arrival, he will become the second most active U.S. ambassador in Europe. (Note: U.S. Ambassador to Italy, Philip, has also recently departed to return to his post.)

Admiral Li Hsi was a core member of the American navalism faction and worked closely with President Roosevelt in implementing the naval expansion plan. In light of the uncertain fate of French African ports, the situation in the Mediterranean, and the disposition of the French fleet, many believe that Admiral Li Hsi, with his experience and prestige, is the most suitable person to serve as ambassador to France. According to Washington officials, Admiral Li Hsi is capable of enhancing France's courage and preventing the disintegration of its colonies.

The United States is greatly concerned about France's territories in the Atlantic and Pacific, namely Martinique in the Caribbean Sea, Dakar on the coast of West Africa, and Vietnam in the Far East. If sovereignty over these territories is transferred to Germany and Italy, or if they are allowed to be fully utilized by them, it would threaten the security of the United States. Admiral Li Hsi should also encourage the Vichy government to strengthen its support for the Vietnamese authorities in resisting the aggression of the Japanese army and navy.

In short, the United States' appointment of an ambassador to France is a forceful move taken in response to various overseas events. Observing this action, the French people, who are currently facing numerous wounds and sufferings, can understand that the friendship of the United States is not fickle, but reliable in times of need. They can also know that defeated France is not isolated, and the United States will not abandon them to the arbitrary control of Germany.

Regarding the Japanese government's dispatch of former Foreign Minister Admiral Nomura as ambassador to the United States, after this news was announced, some American expatriates in Tokyo who had already booked tickets to return home canceled their tickets and postponed their departure. According to Japanese newspapers, Foreign Minister Matsuoka's selection of this ambassador has eased the current crisis between the United States and Japan. In reality, although Nomura's appointment in a time of crisis can be said to be timely, it is feared that it will serve no other purpose than to delay the matter and avoid immediately "showing its cards" to the United States!

As for Nomura's strategy towards the United States, it can be glimpsed from the policies he pursued during his tenure as Foreign Minister. At that time, he drafted a plan to promptly resolve the damages suffered by the American people during the Sino-Japanese War, thereby easing the tense relations between the United States and Japan. However, the question is whether this method of easing the tensions of 1939 can salvage the situation after 1940. The current crisis is not merely caused by the damages suffered by Americans during the war. The crucial point is Japan's conclusion of a military alliance treaty with Germany. Americans believe that this treaty is an attempt to intimidate the United States.

This American perception is not due to any misunderstanding of the treaty's provisions, but rather is caused by the aggressive speeches of Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka. Konoe stated that "The issue of peace or war in the Pacific will depend on whether the Japanese or Americans can understand and respect each other's positions." He also advised the United States that "Japan, Germany, and Italy are building a new world order and making it conform to the new world trend. The United States must consider and understand this. If the United States cannot understand Japan's true intentions, then there is no other path but to go to war." Two days later, he added that the Japanese should "prepare to cope with the worst situation."

Foreign Minister Matsuoka also declared to all countries that "If all countries wish to reduce the damages they suffer to the minimum, they must abandon all actions to aid the Chongqing government."

However, the result of these warnings was the opposite. As the British government announced the reopening of the Burma Road, the U.S. government simultaneously advised expatriates in the Far East to evacuate. Canada then banned the shipment of copper to Japan, and 4,200 members of the U.S. Naval Reserve followed suit, heading to naval bases in the Pacific to join the fleet.

Since the United States and Britain have indicated their readiness to "show their cards," Japan does not seem to have such a resolution. Stepping back, even if we admit that Konoe and Matsuoka's remarks were due to misunderstandings of the American situation, and even if we acknowledge that Nomura's mission to the United States is an indication of Japan's initial intentions, the fundamental cause of the discord between Japan and the United States has not disappeared.

Forced by circumstances, Japan is attempting to implement a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union and the United States. Admiral Nomura's mission to the United States and Lieutenant General Tatekawa's mission to the Soviet Union are two gestures of Japan's effort to avoid isolation. On the other hand, it strengthened the Japan-Germany alliance, misjudging the impact of this alliance on the United States, thinking that the United States could be intimidated. The result was that it provoked the anger of the American people, which was not what it had expected.

### Current Educational Situation in Haimen and Qidong: Maintaining with Great Effort Amid Difficult Circumstances

(Special Correspondent in Northern Jiangsu) More than two years after the fall of various counties and county seats in the Tongru District of Northern Jiangsu, education personnel in various counties have been able to faithfully and diligently perform their duties despite the difficult circumstances. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education recently received a report from a supervisor inspecting the educational conditions in various counties in the Tong District, which records the details. The current educational situations in Haimen and Qidong counties are disclosed as follows:

Haimen: Wang Feng, the director of the Haimen Education Bureau, has just taken office this semester and has formulated concrete plans for the implementation of education. Lu Shusheng, the supervisor, has been quite diligent in his routine inspection work. Education funding includes both direct collection and county government collection, totaling 122,565.51 yuan. On the expenditure side, education administration expenses are 14,952 yuan, general education expenses are 17,438 yuan, compulsory education expenses are 72,597 yuan, social education expenses are 8,580 yuan, and temporary expenses are 8,240 yuan. The safekeeping of funds still belongs to the county treasury, and payment procedures are still overseen by the county accounting director. However, it has been misappropriated twice due to military influences, but has now been gradually returned. In terms of raising funds, it is planned to enclose the autonomous public fields of Hai Xinsha to increase land revenue. There are two middle schools in the county, six junior high schools, one simplified normal school, with a total of 22 classes and 1,311 students. There are 26 primary schools, 174 junior primary schools, and 14 compulsory education classes, with a total of 341 classes and 21,996 students. Social education includes four people's schools, which are jointly run by the county's simplified normal school department. Teachers are assigned on a rotation basis by students.

Qidong: Qidong County has been affected by military events for many years, but education has never been interrupted. Zhang Shiming, the director, has served for more than ten years, and his consistent spirit and seriousness in handling affairs are truly commendable. Education funding includes land tax, field rent, miscellaneous taxes, and student accommodation fees. Last year's autumn harvest was poor, and the land tax collection was less than 10%. Various miscellaneous taxes are also decreasing daily. However, the county has been able to issue monthly education fees on time and without delay, which demonstrates the local authorities' painstaking efforts to maintain it. Currently, there is one county-run junior high school and private Jishu general commercial vocational schools, with a total of seven classes and 335 students. There are county-run primary schools, and private primary schools, with a total of 63 classes and 3,385 students. There are 99 county-run junior primary schools, and seven private junior primary schools, with a total of 154 classes and 10,032 students. There are 104 compulsory education classes with 6,755 students. There are eight substitute junior primary schools with nine classes and 764 students. Social education includes one experimental farmer education center. Various schools also jointly run social education activities, such as student family visits, parent-teacher meetings, public health guidance, choir groups, drama groups, and wall newspapers, which are being selectively promoted.

On the Mai Ling side, the most dangerous figures, Hangsha Huizi, Lu Qi, Mei Han, and other main players, have not yet appeared. It is rumored that they will make a final performance in the final battle. Hua Xing's new player, Chuan Jinsheng, also failed to arrive in time due to a delayed departure date. In yesterday's game, Hua Xing's momentum was exceptionally strong in the first half, sweeping through the opponents and taking a ten-point lead with a score of 22 to 12. In the second half, the American team fought back and even surpassed them at one point. Fortunately, Bao Songyuan's two shots allowed Hua Xing to win by a narrow one-point margin in a thrilling match. The final result was 33 to 32. It was a dangerous victory. This competition adopts a two-out-of-three system. Now that Hua Xing has won two consecutive games, the large silver cup donated by Ms. Lu Wenyin has been permanently won by Hua Xing.

During the Break Time, the Game Ball is Auctioned Off, and Master Sniper Zhu Qiliang Pays the Highest Price of 300 Yuan to Win it in a Thrilling Move.

Changing Sides and Fighting Again, Both Sides Still Compete With the Original Lineup. Because Hua Xing Won Too Easily in the First Half, the Defense Was Not as Strict as in the First Half. Unexpectedly, the Foundation Loosened, and Seven Points Were Quickly Added, Chasing the Score to 19 to 22, With a Difference of Only Three Points. From This Point On, the One-Sided Situation Changed to a Thrilling Scene. When Bao Songyuan Scored, Mann Retaliated in the Same Way. At 21 to 24, There Was a Temporary Pause Due to a Martial Drama. The Battle Resumed, and the Mai Team's Arrogance Became More Intense.

Nicholas Added Insult to Injury and Made Another Decision, Reaching Into the Basket and Scoring, After 32 to 2, Hua Xing Could Not Help But Panic. Hongbin and Zhenzhong Missed Three Shots Each. Fortunately, Bao Songyuan Scored on Two Shots in a Row, Finally Gaining the Final Victory at 32 to 32. The Mai Team Lost Twice.

### Food: Rice Speculation Slightly Subdued, Rice Prices Fall Slightly by Four to Five Yuan

No. 1 Saigon Opens at Eighty-Three Four Yuan, More Than 18,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Continue to Arrive

Since a large number of futures goods arrived in the rice market this month, people were uneasy and rushed to sell the goods they were holding. In an environment of abundant goods and weak sales, repeated declines were seen. Yesterday, after the holiday, the market resumed, and the sellers became more willing to sell as the source of goods became more abundant. The market was filled with goods, and the sellers competed to sell them. The sales market, on the other hand, lacked speculative transactions and relied on some actual sales from local stores. The sales channels were stable, and the transactions were limited, resulting in an oversupply. In the past, sellers hoarded goods, but now, due to the unified planning of foreign prices and the continuous flow of sources, and the fact that 600,000 to 700,000 bags have been successfully ordered before and after, they have to sell in groups at the end of the year, fearing that the market will be difficult to support and suffer losses. Therefore, floating households devalued their prices, and foreign merchants sold them cheaply, allowing the market to suffer huge reactions. After the market opened, it fell all the way until the close, and the prices fell by three, four, or five yuan compared with the previous week. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon is only 84-5 yuan to 83.5 yuan, No. 2 is 79 yuan, all the way down to 77 yuan, No. 1 Chen Siamese is 81.5 yuan, new is 83 yuan, No. 2 is 76-7 yuan, Huo Jiao is 83 yuan, down to 80 yuan, Xiaowen is 71.5 yuan, 71 yuan, down to 70 yuan in the afternoon, Mi Lu is 67 yuan, broken tip is 64 yuan, down to 56

Although the domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice also has poor sales channels, it is easier to support the market because the arrival of goods is limited. The decline is not as strong as that of foreign rice, with only a decrease of one or two yuan. If Kunshan Hu sees white japonica rice at 100 yuan to 97 yuan, Wuxi special japonica rice is 102 yuan, and Qingjiao Hu sees thin rice at 97.5 yuan and 97 yuan, the original package is 101 yuan.

Glutinous rice is still unusually deserted. Transactions are rare, and the owners have no intention of selling in a hurry, so although the situation is sluggish, the prices have not changed. Yili white yuan opens at 91-2 yuan, and Hong Kong white yuan is high from 80 yuan and 30 cents to 77 yuan.

Foreign rice has a strong source. Taikoo Company's Anshun ship arrived in port on the 12th (the day before yesterday) with 5,239 bags from Hong Kong, and the company's Hanyang ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday with 13,494 bags from Hong Kong. The two ships carried a total of 18,733 bags. 9,300 bags of corn were shipped to Yantai today. (Zu)

### Downstream Factors in the Flour Market: Continuous Source, Sold More

Flour: Yesterday, the flour market went downstream again. It was found that the supply of foreign flour in the market has gradually become more and more. On the sales side, the local customers lack a good appetite. Although the flat-sale flour in the street is insufficient, the shortage is very small. In addition, the sharp drop in the rice market has softened everyone's hearts. Most of the holders are selling, and there are few entrants. The whole market only opened 2,000 to 3,000 bags of Australian flour under the Flower and Clock Tower brand, priced at 23 yuan and 80 cents to 70 cents, and 1,500 bags of Maihua brand foreign flour newly shipped from Hong Kong, priced at 22 yuan and 60 cents. The market situation in the future is even weaker, and the price is reduced by another one or two yuan. The flour from this factory is still 21 yuan and 50 cents, supplied by two factories for about 4,000 bags.

Foreign flour: There are still continuous arrivals in Shanghai. Taikoo Company's Anshun and Hanyang ships, in addition to carrying a large amount of foreign rice, also carried a lot of flour from Hong Kong. It is estimated that the Anshun ship carried 2,000 bags and the Hanyang ship carried 5,000 bags, totaling 7,000 bags.

Wheat: The market situation yesterday did not have any special entries and exits, because the amount of deposits is small, and it is not easy for each flour mill to purchase. However, in the midst of the downstream prices of flour, the appetite has also been invisibly slackened. It is said that the Japanese factory's door market price is still 31 yuan, and only two to three hundred bags are collected. There is no news of market transactions.

### Finance Foreign Firms Eager to Acquire Sterling

Various parties were agitated by rumors, and the foreign exchange market often showed a soft trend. However, today, from 1 PM to 2 PM, was the rollover date from January to February, and it was reported that buyers had to pay sellers around 80 dollars, which inevitably affected buying momentum. Therefore, with the buying momentum of 同康, 賣康, 公和, 義豐, 新豐, and 大德成, 祥和 and 一利德孚 silver firms helped with sales. Although the price rose from 6370 dollars to 6445 dollars, many deals along the way did not last long and soon fell back. Finally, it slightly retreated to 6425 dollars, an increase of 22 dollars.

### Securities Domestic Bonds Rebound

Yesterday's unofficial trading of Unified Public Bonds saw ups and downs, fluctuating between 0.35 and 0.89 dollars. At the beginning of the morning, trading opened, and buying and selling were said to be equal due to the lack of news. Therefore, the market hovered, and the firm trend was not sharp. Later, there was a sudden rumor of favorable bullish sentiment, and people's hearts suddenly became vibrant. Major players scrambled to absorb, and short sellers also threw out, so the market was fiercely competitive, and each bond could not rise directly. The afternoon still hovered, and the foothold seemed firmer. 叶, a major player, continued to purchase tirelessly, and there was also the hedging of floating shorts, resulting in a tightening of chips on the surface, and there was an image of demand exceeding supply. As a result of the ups and downs of each bond, they all rose by 0.45 to 0.6 dollars, and 96 also brought a good 0.15 dollars.

### Past Events of the Woolen Industry in the 29th Year (Continued)

— Floating Stone Student

(1) Those outside the industry who hold large amounts of legal tender all consider hoarding goods as a solid and stable strategy; (2) Fixed arrivals are extremely rare, and the inventory is lacking. However, most of them are still cheaper than in June and July. In terms of business, although the transaction volume is larger than in previous years, it is actually less profitable because the previous goods were priced low, and the current goods are priced high. The logic is very clear. Because the Japanese control has intensified, the export of woolen goods must have a "removal permit" and "entry permit." Passenger transport has become even more difficult, and there is a shortage of goods in other ports. For example, in Nanjing and Ningbo, the price of woolen goods is, compared with Shanghai, on average different by a small fraction up to one or two times. Therefore, transportation is slightly more convenient, such as Nanjing, and generally doing single round trips has greatly increased. In addition to the trend of commercial situation, unexpected special news occurred in the middle of the quarter, more than in previous years. Also, because the price of all goods rises endlessly and the cost of living rises, the salaried class feels great pain. Dyehouse workers went on strike, followed by West clothing factory employees from the Fourth Avenue and Daxin Street. Soon after, 紅　tailors on Avenue Joffre went on strike. After communication, clothing workers in Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Sichuan Road went on strike. The result was nothing more than an increase in wages: 70% for those below three dollars, 60% for those above four dollars, 50% for those above five dollars, and 40% for those above six dollars. Then, the Shilu clothing shop workers went on strike. In the end, the purchasing power of woolen goods was more reduced than in the first half of the year. More high-end customers gradually became middle-class, and middle-class customers turned to buying lower-end goods, so the outlet for lower-end 10-20 dollar per yard and 3-4 dollar per foot woolen goods suddenly became active. In order to cater to the psychology of customers, the domestically produced goods from Shanghai Textile Factory were particularly popular in production and sales. Filler goods with more cotton and less wool, such as rainproof cloth, filled shoe flannel, fake straight-line, and cotton camel hair, flooded the market. Now, the prices of woolen goods in the four seasons of the 29th year are compiled below.

(Note) ... represents no market for falling orders Unit: Legal tender yuan Current wholesale market price per yard (End)

### Yarn and Cotton Buying Yarn in Hope of Price Increase — People Become More Confident —

The yarn market is very strong, and the rising trend has resumed. This is because the general situation has been hovering for many days, and the downward trend can temporarily stop. Therefore, speculators simply go long, so you buy and I buy, the surface tightens, and the market price immediately rises. At the same time, the Hong Kong gang slightly acquired a few packages of cheap two-three count yarn, and people became more confident. However, colored yarn is still 150 yuan cheaper than Shuangma, and some have already been acquired, so the trend is also rising. The high price for 20-count Shuangma is 1402 yuan, and the low price is 1366 yuan. In the afternoon, it was traded at 1407-8 yuan, and then at 1402 yuan. Someone sold.

Shuangma opened in the morning with a relatively peaceful momentum, and people's hearts were still stable. The first plate price was 1372 yuan, and gradually it fell to 1366 yuan. But as the price fell, rumors in the market suddenly became fierce, that some news was favorable to the bulls. However, the foreign exchange rate was still quiet, but buyers still seemed to swarm, so the market immediately moved forward, and the rising force was very strong, directly out of the 1400-yuan mark. Those who profited along the way settled, and then into 400 yuan, for 1395 yuan. The closing price was 1399 yuan. A total of 6,045 packages were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Shuangma rose by 29 yuan. Also, 133 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows: 5,400 from 同行, 570 from 香港, 75 from 宁波 Total 6,045

### Factory Side Buys Spot Cotton Market Slightly Improves

The spot cotton situation is slightly firmer, because Shenxin No. 29 Factory has recently released a huge amount of cotton yarn, and the raw materials have been slightly supplemented, so there are more transactions and the market is firmer. However, overseas-priced Indian cotton is very cheap. The price of 米特林 is 316 yuan, the price of 惠司登 is 256 yuan, and the price of Brazilian cotton is 300 yuan.

Another message says that the foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, initially rose because of purchases by peers, and then because of sales by Wall Street, the latter part of the bulls ended, and the result was that the closing price fell 24 pounds of sound compared with the previous day. India is expected to fall by more than two rupees.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, the cotton market has also turned lively in recent days because of the high price of yarn. However, because the factory side's intake is relatively stagnant, there has been no large number of transactions. However, scattered transactions are still called lively.

### Piece Goods The Rising Trend of Cotton Cloth Continues

Yesterday's factory cloth market trend was firmer, and the thinking of internal and external囤戶 traders was vigorous, and there was a continued momentum. 客帮 bought because the market was slick, so transactions were frequent, and the selling plate was uniformly raised. Coarse and fine cloth twills rose immediately by half a dollar per piece in the morning, and continued to rise by 0.25 to 0.5 dollars in the afternoon. Bleached and dyed cloth also rose by about 0.5 dollars per piece. Nearly a thousand pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. The 浙皖赣帮办 color cloth coarse and fine cloth were more than two hundred pieces, and the 粤港帮办 bleached and dyed cloth coarse cloth twill and other more than three hundred pieces, and the 北路烟津帮办 color cloth heavy coarse cloth one hundred and several ten pieces, and the national Singapore and other places handled bleaching cloth color oblique khaki and other six thousand several hundred pieces, and on the 14th, there were two hundred pieces of head transported to Yantai, and another sixty pieces transported to Tianjin.

The rising trend of Dongbu is very strong, because the air turns prosperous in all directions, and the internal and external purchase is more and more prosperous, and it rises step by step. The highest plate of 12-pound faucet fine cloth is 43.7 dollars, and the closing price is slightly back to 43.55 dollars, which is 1.15 dollars higher than last week, and the new single of 四君子哔叽 is 1.245 dollars, and the old single is 1.205 dollars.

### Oilcake Oil Market Speculation Eager to Try Qingdao Barrelled Raw Oil 135.75 Yuan

Yesterday, Qingdao barreled raw oil actually created an unprecedented record of 135.75 yuan, up three yuan sharper than before, and the rest also rose by one or two yuan, and a total of 130 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 200 cans of Jiangbei raw oil, 130 cans of Yantai raw oil, 100 pieces of Yantai raw oil, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, and 100 pieces of the first phase of February were sold.

### Woolen Woolen Industry Greatly Benefits

— Recent Trading Is Very Lively —

In the past years, the woolen market has turned flat at this time, the trading has turned light, and it is busy taking stock, collecting accounts, and preparing for the year-end summary. This year's Geng is very different, and the entry and exit are mostly cash, less credit, and most of them have also changed to the Gregorian calendar to settle accounts. All major and small numbers, in the 29th year, have made great profits, which is rare since the woolen industry. The funds on hand are abundant, and the inventory is lacking, but they are searching for each other and hoarding goods, so the woolen trading is particularly lively.

### North-South Goods Dried Lily Bud Price Rising Greatly

Because the inventory of lily buds is becoming increasingly scarce, the market situation is becoming increasingly tight, and the price is gradually rising. Yesterday's number plate price rose greatly, with the top village dishes opening to 140 yuan, up 13 yuan, followed by 128 yuan to 125 yuan, and the ordinary 110 yuan.

### British Tram Company Will Increase Prices Again Various Circles Hope To Cancel Original Proposal Related To Work Efficiency Of All Industries In The City Most Citizens Have No Affordability The Implementation Period Still Awaits The Authorities To Review And Withdraw Their Decision

The British Tram Company of Shanghai Public Concession in this port, citing reasons such as tight foreign exchange and increased expenses, submitted a request to the Public Works Department to increase the fare by another 35%. This request has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department on the 8th and decided to be implemented on all tram and trolleybus lines in the Public Concession area from the 26th of this month.

The Authorities Approved The City Felt Heartbreak

Since learning of the news, the residents of this city have been deeply saddened by the approval of the request by the Public Works Department. Since autumn last year, the prices of all goods have risen month by month, reaching a peak in December, posing a serious threat to the citizens. Since the beginning of this year, prices have not fallen, so the lives of civilians still feel extremely difficult. Tram and automobile are the main departments of public services, and they are closely related to the prosperity of the entire business and the welfare of citizens, and the work efficiency of all employees in the city.

Repeated Price Increases Go Against Principles

In addition, the fare has already increased once in September last year, and it has not been a few days since then, and another price increase is heard, which violates the purpose of public utilities. Since Shanghai's deformed development, the population has increased sharply, almost doubling. Although various businesses show a strong exterior but empty interior phenomenon, the various means of transportation are very developed, and the prosperity of the business is far from comparable to before the incident.

Salaried Class Difficult To Bear

Therefore, the amount of surplus is amazing, and the raw materials used by the company are mostly ordered several years ago, although the price has risen today, but only a part of it does not contain "absolute" nature. All sectors of the community in this port believe that since the implementation period is still ten days away, there is ample time to review. It is hoped that the authorities will take into account the plight of the citizens at this time and in this place and withdraw the decision to increase prices. The largest customers of trams are all the salary class of the middle and lower classes. Their monthly income is meager, and they usually save on food and clothing. They cannot even provide warmth for their families, and it is a fact that another sudden increase in expenditure is not allowed.

### British Ambassador's Wife Left For Hong Kong Yesterday

The wife of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and Sir Victor Sassoon, owner of Sassoon and Co., left Shanghai for Hong Kong yesterday on the China Mail Steamship Company's new steamship Chitralenka. It is heard that many foreign merchants and banking tycoons in this city also boarded the Chitralenka steamship for Hong Kong.

### French Ambassador Postpones Return To Shanghai Ordered To Go To Vietnam Related To Thai-Vietnamese Conflict The Public Believe The Mission Is Extremely Important

The French Ambassador, Henri Cosme, since arriving in Hong Kong from Chongqing at the end of last year, originally planned to leave Hong Kong and return to Shanghai immediately. According to a Pingming News Agency reporter, the French Ambassador suddenly changed his itinerary on the evening of the 3rd of this month, and suddenly left Hong Kong by ship late that night for Hanoi to meet with General Peng Gu, the Governor of Vietnam. After arriving in Hanoi, he went to Saigon for official business, and the return to Shanghai was repeatedly delayed. According to reliable sources, the French Ambassador suddenly changed his itinerary because he received an order from Vichy on the evening of the 3rd of this month, ordering him to go to Vietnam. The fact that Mr. Ge left Hong Kong late that night proves the importance of his mission. The public believe that Mr. Ge's trip is related to the expanded situation of the Vietnam-Thailand conflict. According to the related parties of the French Consul General in this port, there is no definite news about the Ambassador's return to Shanghai as of yesterday afternoon, so it is difficult to return to Shanghai within a few days. It is also known that the Ambassador was accompanied by his wife and secretary when he left Chongqing this time.

### The Authorities Strengthen Control And Management Of Shanghai's Finance

The Black Market Foreign Exchange Rate Is Maintained At A Steady Level All Banks And Firms Must Fill In Forms For Reporting And Verification

Since the Shanghai financial market was adjusted by the National Bank and friendly banks, and the silver and money industry, it has remained stable even during the period of general closing of various industries, making it impossible for speculators to take advantage of the situation and manipulate the market. (1) After the black market foreign exchange is maintained by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, and the legitimate needs of Chinese and foreign industries are supplied as much as possible, the legal exchange rate remains unchanged, the black market stands at a natural level, and the management policy is gradually strengthened, which is very helpful to financial stability. (2)

Securities Market

Because the Chinese government has repeatedly stated that it will maintain credit, and the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks have discounted and paid for the tariff-guaranteed bonds, the price has skyrocketed, creating a new post-war record. The stock price of Chinese stocks is higher than the face value because all industries have made profits and the stock prices of various national goods factories. (3) The gold and other black markets are illegal organizations, and the government has long ordered them to be banned, but those who still buy and sell are in violation of the law, so the gold's soaring and falling is irrelevant to the entire financial situation. (4) The entire financial situation is due to the National Bank

Handling Discounting

And the adjustment of the reserve treasury of the silver and money industry. After the New Year, the various industries are becoming more stable. The foreign exchange is low and the silver roots are relaxed. The financial situation shown in this session is more stable than the previous session. Regarding the credit of legal currency, because of the financial management, it is becoming stronger. The issuance of miscellaneous banknotes does not affect the credit of legal currency. The black market price of legal currency is becoming higher. The silver and money industry association has also received an order from the Ministry of Finance to investigate the lower half of the year of the 29th year of the various banks and firms.

Deposit and Lending Rates

Including (1) Loans, credit, and mortgages, (2) Deposits, fixed-term and demand, (3) Discounting, peers, etc. It is heard that the two industries associations have complied with the order and attached a form for member banks and firms to comply with, and it is heard that the Ministry of Finance, in addition to encouraging internal migration, is planning a proper method for Shanghai's floating capital to be used for the country, and not to flow into the market, for speculators to manipulate the market. At the same time, it will find ways to ban Shanghai's speculative markets, so that finance can be stable for a long time, and people's lives can be stable.

Refusing to Use Miscellaneous Banknotes

Dazhong News Agency said, The American Evening Post in English said, A reporter this morning (13th) held miscellaneous banknotes issued by a certain party and tried to go shopping, but shops in both the British and French concessions of this port refused to accept them. Even the Chinese merchants and British and American banks in the market also refused to accept these miscellaneous banknotes as deposits. Its future can be imagined. The main purpose of opening a certain bank is known to everyone to be the issuance of "banknotes". It is said that after the "bank" was established on the 6th, as of the 11th, it has issued a total of 6,413,927.2 yuan of "circulation notes". The cash reserve, no more and no less, also happens to be consistent with the amount issued. The reporter asked a certain gentleman in the banking industry about the possibility of this matter. It is said that since the National Government reformed the currency system, the private cash has long been collected by the government. The Southeast has achieved the best results. Gold has long been managed by the government. All gold and silver were transported by the central government to a safe zone before the war broke out. Where does the cash come from now? If it is said that the reserve of the bank is foreign exchange, it has neither obtained foreign loans, nor has it been able to control the trade in the occupied areas (now controlled by the Japanese army in Central China). Where does the foreign exchange come from? Based on the above reasons, legal currency is strong and highly trusted by the people, which also has its origins.

### Public Granary Management Committee Begins Operations Yesterday; Office Located on the Third Floor of the Public Works Department; Qin Runqing Appointed as Chairman

The Shanghai Food and Timber Public Granary Management Committee, since holding its first committee meeting on the 7th of this month, has been actively preparing for various matters. The committee's office has now been decided to be located in Room 265, on the third floor of the Public Works Department on Jiangxi Road. Work commenced yesterday. Mr. Qin Runqing, a leader in the banking industry, was recommended by the first committee meeting to serve as chairman. After the meeting, the chairman and vice-chairmen of the committee, He Dekui and Xu Jiyin, jointly obtained Mr. Qin's consent. He reported to the office yesterday. Simultaneously, Mr. Yan Esheng, secretary of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was also hired to concurrently serve as the committee's secretary. Yesterday (the 13th) at 10 a.m., Chairman He Dekui, Vice-Chairman Xu Jiyin, Treasurer Xi Yushu, Chairman Qin Runqing, Secretary Yan Esheng, and others held a meeting in the Public Works Department conference room to discuss all operational procedures in great detail. It is also reported that various industries are separately urging the collection of rice subscriptions, preparing to pay 50% before the 15th of this month.

Imported Rice Prices Plunge Yesterday

A reporter from Da Zhong News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that reports had arrived in Shanghai from the origins of imported rice, such as Saigon, Siam, Rangoon, and the transportation hub of Hong Kong, indicating that rice prices in various markets had fallen. Consequently, prices of imported rice in local markets plummeted by around three yuan per stone yesterday. Siamese No. 1 rice fell from 88 yuan to 85 yuan per stone, which is four yuan lower than the ceiling price of 89 yuan. Saigon No. 1 rice fell from 87 yuan to 84 yuan per stone. The decline in Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 mixed broken rice was even more significant, continuing to fall sharply by four yuan yesterday. Therefore, the prices of various domestic rice types also declined by over one yuan. It was also learned that Hong Kong rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday: (1) 6,700 bags on the "An Shun" vessel; (2) 13,494 bags on the "Hanyang" vessel.

Consequences of Inflated Rice Prices

On Friday, a certain rice merchant sold over one hundred bags of glutinous rice to a distillery on Pingliang Road, Yangshupu. As four trucks were unloading the goods at the distillery, over one hundred impoverished people from Jiangbei suddenly arrived, armed with small knives. They cut open the burlap sacks and used prepared rice-washing baskets and flour bags to seize the glutinous rice. The distillery and the rice unloading workers were unable to stop them. They reported to the responsible police station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to suppress the situation, dispersing the impoverished people. However, the losses were significant, with about ten or more stones of rice stolen. This is purely the consequence of rice merchants inflating rice prices.

### Successor to Japanese Deputy Director-General Recommended by Japanese Consul; Ibusuki to Resign at the End of Next Month

Hirohide Ibusuki, the Japanese Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, has decided to resign at the end of next month. According to a reporter from Ping Ming News Agency, regarding the selection of a successor, the Japanese Consul-General has already recommended a candidate to the Public Works Department. The candidate has been decided, but neither the Public Works Department nor the Japanese Consul wants to announce it yet. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, Ibusuki's resignation is due to his inability to fully comply with the Japanese side's wishes in his work, thus necessitating his departure. Therefore, the successor will be recommended by the Japanese Consulate. However, according to the Public Works Department's long-standing administrative practice, all matters of the Public Works Department must be decided by the Board of Directors and the Consular Body, and the Director-General is the one who executes the orders. The Japanese Deputy Director-General can only handle matters concerning Japanese residents, but even then, it must be approved by the Director-General.

### Indiscriminate Bombing by Japanese Aircraft; Ferryboat at Haiyan; Nearly One Hundred Innocent Civilians Killed; Charitable Organizations Appeal to Shanghai

According to reports just received here yesterday, on the 6th of this month, several ferryboats traveling from Haiyan in southern Jiangsu to northern Zhejiang were subjected to indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft. Approximately ninety people were killed at the time, and three or four ferryboats sank. Almost none of the passengers or crew survived. Industry sources point out that since the Zhejiang coast was blockaded by the Japanese, Haiyan has become the main transportation hub between Shanghai and Ningbo. Those traveling from Shanghai to Ningbo first go by land to Haiyan and then take a ferryboat across Hangzhou Bay to northern Zhejiang. This transportation route has not been disrupted for several months. However, earlier this month, Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bombed the area without prior warning. The ferryboats at Haiyan have now ceased operations. The victims this time were all Ningbo natives, so the local charitable organizations have appealed to the Ningbo Shanghai Association for assistance.

### Fuzhou-Line Foreign Vessel Uncertain About Resumption

The British merchant vessel "Wing Tai," which sails opposite the "Yong Feng" vessel on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line, returned to Shanghai from Fujian yesterday and docked at the 16th Wharf to unload cargo. According to the Fushun Company, the agent for the vessel, the "Wing Tai's" continued sailing to Fuzhou has not been decided. This is because the navigation on that line is severely monitored by Japanese warships, causing various delays and increasing unnecessary losses, which is uneconomical. The resumption of sailing will be determined based on the situation. Currently, after the "Fu Yong" and "Yong Feng" vessels were obstructed, the "Wing Tai" vessel is the only remaining one on the Shanghai-Fujian line. If this vessel also ceases operations, the Shanghai-Fujian line will be in a state of disruption.

### Hong Kong to Implement Import Restrictions Starting Today; Cash Deposit Determined by Cabin Class; Refundable Upon Arrival with Receipt

The population import restrictions promulgated by the British authorities in Hong Kong to prevent undesirable elements from entering will take effect today. From today onwards, travelers going to Hong Kong from Shanghai must have a passport issued by the Hong Kong Immigration Department to be allowed to disembark. British shipping companies in Shanghai, such as Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and China Navigation Company, have already notified passengers going to Hong Kong to prepare the aforementioned certificates in order to avoid difficulties upon arrival. However, those without certificates can provide a cash deposit, which varies depending on the cabin class. Those purchasing first-class tickets must pay HK$100, cabin class HK$50, and deck class and steerage class HK$25. The shipping company will issue a receipt, which can be used to claim a refund of the deposit upon arrival in Hong Kong. As for passports, the various shipping companies and China Travel Service can also apply on behalf of passengers, requiring a fee of HK$5 and two personal photos, which can be collected in about two weeks. Furthermore, Taikoo Shipping Company has notified passengers going to Hong Kong that vaccination certificates must be at least two weeks old to be valid.

Vessels Sailing to Hong Kong to be Inspected

According to China Travel Service, the Jardine Matheson Company's "Yusheng" vessel, which sailed from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 11th of this month, will arrive in Hong Kong today. According to the new regulations, it will be inspected by the Hong Kong authorities. Most of the passengers on board did not have time to complete the visa procedures before departure. They only paid a deposit of HK$20 to the shipping company when purchasing their tickets, in addition to various import guarantees. However, this change in procedure is actually due to the recent trips to Hong Kong by vessels from China Navigation Company, Taikoo, and Jardine Matheson, where passengers did not have time to complete the procedures. Therefore, it will soon be abolished. In the future, travelers going to Hong Kong will still need to have a visa. The company is currently issuing forms for applying for a visa from the Immigration Department. Upon collection, a guarantor must first be secured, and after approval, it will be issued. After completion, the company will forward it to the Hong Kong branch for guarantee to the Immigration Department to apply for a certificate issued by the Immigration Department.

### Negotiations to Lift Zhejiang Coastal "Blockade" Underway; Results Expected Within Two Weeks; Tugboats Diverted to Downstream Yangtze Ports

The "China Press" reports that representatives of Shanghai shipowners are currently in negotiations with the relevant Japanese authorities in hopes of easing restrictions on shipping. If these negotiations conclude successfully in the near future, as some in the shipping industry expect, the naval blockade of nearby coastal ports will be partially lifted, allowing supplies to be transported into some Chinese-controlled areas. As the Japanese authorities are determined to enforce the ban at any cost, some shipowners have suggested:

Foreign Vessels to be Leased to Japanese Merchants

To continue coastal trade, it is heard that this plan has been approved by Japanese lessees. However, the question is how Japanese-leased ships can be allowed to enter waters controlled by the Chinese military, such as Wenzhou. To overcome this difficulty, shipowner representatives are also in discussions. According to some shipowners, negotiations may yield results, with some in the shipping industry yesterday (the 12th) predicting that discussions could conclude within two weeks. It is heard that this discussion is particularly:

Limited to Ports in Zhejiang Province

At the same time, tugboats flying foreign flags, which used to operate along the Chinese coast, are now operating between Shanghai and the downstream Yangtze River and areas outside Jiangsu. As the saying goes, "Necessity is the mother of invention." The coastal industry has proven this. Since the Japanese naval authorities implemented the shipping ban in July of last year, the once-thriving shipping industry has plummeted. Although shipowners have tried to reach a compromise with the Japanese, the Japanese have firmly continued the ban, resulting in the complete stagnation of coastal shipping. Vessels are idle, and shipowners and lessees are incurring significant losses. Therefore, there is no shortage of those who send ships on roundabout routes, even risking being seized, to continue their service. The reason shipowners:

Risk Sending Ships to Navigate

Is primarily motivated by the high freight rates to ports such as Wenzhou. Many ships have repeatedly attempted to take risks, resulting in their seizure by the Japanese authorities. It was not until the shipowners and consular representatives negotiated with the Japanese authorities for a long time that they were released. Recently, the Japanese naval authorities discovered that some ships were entering ports at night, taking advantage of Japanese unpreparedness, and mooring overnight to unload cargo. The Japanese then sent troops to board some ships entering late at night or early in the morning and confiscated all the cargo on board, putting an end to such risky attempts. Starting a month ago, shipowners, lessees, or cargo consigners were charged exorbitant "special fees" by the Japanese naval authorities to unload cargo. However, these fees were far greater than the profits earned, so many shipowners decided to completely suspend operations.

### Second Shipment of American Aid Medicines Arrives in Shanghai; Dr. Baker Personally Distributes Them

After the first shipment of 200 tons of American Red Cross relief medicines for Chinese refugees arrived in China and was distributed, the second shipment of over one hundred large boxes of relief medicines also arrived in Shanghai on American vessels. These medicines, including various medicinal liquids, tablets, and pills, are of considerable value. Dr. Baker, who recently arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, is personally in charge of the distribution. As for the second shipment of 1,000 tons, or 40,000 bags, of wheat, it has been shipped to Shanghai on the Collinsworth vessel and is expected to arrive and be distributed by the end of next month. At a time when various charities are having difficulty organizing winter relief, the provision of rice and wheat is like a timely rain after a long drought. Furthermore, after arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the American President Lines' "President Pierce" on the 6th of this month, Dr. Baker is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the "President Taft" on the 22nd to go to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to Chongqing. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Federation of Charitable Organizations, the Jisheng Society, the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee, and the Salvation Army, among others, are deeply grateful for Dr. Baker's enthusiasm in providing relief to Chinese disaster victims and have specially scheduled a welcome and farewell reception at the Hong Mian Restaurant on Edward Road on the 17th of this month to express their gratitude.

### Save on New Year's Gifts to Aid Refugees; Refugee Association Appeals to All Sectors

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizen Group Fundraising Committee has issued a notice to all sectors, appealing to save on New Year's expenses to aid refugees. It states that the Lunar New Year is fast approaching. In Shanghai, it is customary for relatives and friends to exchange expensive gifts, resulting in significant waste. Moreover, most of these gifts are foreign goods, which further drains our economic interests. At this time of festive celebration, there are still over 16,000 refugees in Shanghai, most of whom are elderly, weak, or disabled, and have no homes to return to. Although the number of refugees has decreased, the expenditure on relief funds has increased, making it difficult to sustain. We sincerely hope that people of all sectors will show compassion and donate their New Year's gift expenses to aid these refugees, so that we can fulfill our initial relief efforts and demonstrate our responsibility to help our fellow compatriots. If you would like to donate, please send your donations to Room 414, Xingye Building, intersection of Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road, or call 18533, and we will send someone to collect them. Your kind generosity is greatly appreciated.

### Labor Dispute at Four Taxi Companies Nears Resolution; Barbers Demand Improved Treatment

The labor dispute between the Yunfei, Xiang Sheng, Tailai, and Silver four major taxi companies was originally scheduled for a final response at 10 a.m. yesterday, but due to the employers' insufficient preparation, it was postponed to 3 p.m. Four employer representatives and sixteen labor representatives gathered at the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, with Gu Bingyuan mediating for a final negotiation, hoping to salvage the situation. Both sides debated heatedly, and the meeting adjourned at 6 p.m. It is heard that the views of both sides have gradually converged. Due to time constraints, a final negotiation will be scheduled to resolve the dispute. Therefore, the labor side continued to work as usual yesterday. However, there have been no developments regarding the specific situation. Barbers at various barber shops in Shanghai began a partial strike yesterday due to their unsuccessful demands for improved treatment from their employers. It is understood that the reason for the strike is that before the war, the daily business income was split between labor and management at a ratio of 40% for labor and 60% for management. After the war, the employers claimed that business was sluggish and prices were rising, making it difficult to sustain operations. Therefore, they changed the ratio to 30% or 37.5% for labor and 70% or 72.5% for management. Since barber shops in Shanghai uniformly raised prices in mid-December of last year, the barbers have demanded that the employers restore the previous 40/60 split, but their demands have not been met, leading to the strike.

According to news this morning (the 13th), Sai Iwama lost a lot of blood after being wounded and died at 10:30 p.m. The Japanese authorities have implemented special security measures in Hongkou this morning, increasing the deployment of naval and military police to conduct extensive searches to prevent such terrorist acts from happening again.

### Fushun Company Denies News of Xin Anna Vessel Being Robbed; Passengers Landed at Shacheng

Regarding the Xin Anna vessel (Ariacline Moller of Les Fils d'Arlac S. A.), managed by Fushun Company at 35 Fujian Road, which loaded goods and passengers to Fuzhou on the 8th of this month, rumors spread the day before yesterday that it had encountered pirates and been robbed outside the port of Fuzhou. Yesterday, the company denied these rumors, stating that a telegram arrived in Shanghai this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) stating that the vessel had arrived near Fuzhou but saw many Japanese warships anchored, so it returned to Shacheng, first transferring the passengers ashore, and the cargo will be unloaded in Fuzhou when an opportunity arises. The vessel is currently still in Shacheng.

### White Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Holds Final Review; To Be Integrated into the Police Department Starting on the 16th; Commander and Uniforms Unchanged

The Shanghai Volunteer Corps' White Russian Detachment held its final military parade at the Racecourse at 11:30 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 12th). Many officers of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and friends of the detachment attended the event. The reviewer on the grandstand was Colonel Henry, the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. After the review, the White Russian Detachment officers held a reception at the detachment headquarters. Major Ivanov, the commander of the White Russian Detachment, gave a brief speech, expressing his gratitude to Colonel Henry and other officers for their cooperation and assistance to the White Russian Detachment.

Presentation of Souvenirs

After the speech, three Russian silver cigarette cases were presented to Colonel Henry, Major Mann, and Major Bartley, the staff officers of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and a small detachment flag was presented to the Chinese detachment commander, Major Chen, and other Shanghai Volunteer Corps officers. After reciprocal speeches, it was 2 p.m., and they proceeded to the dining room for a meal. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps' White Russian Detachment is the only Russian military unit in the world that is employed. It has existed for 14 years and is scheduled to be integrated into the Public Works Department Police Department this Thursday, the 16th.

Establishment Process

The White Russian Detachment was established on January 21, 1927. Most of the members were remnants of the White Russian army who fled to Shanghai after being defeated in the Russian Revolution. It was initially commanded by Captain Fomin. In 1933, the current commander, Major Ivanov, took over. Before 1932, the White Russian Detachment had only two companies. In that year, when the Japanese attacked Shanghai, the Public Works Department added the White Russian Detachment's fourth company. The members of the third company were all volunteers. Only about thirty of the original members who joined the White Russian Detachment are still serving in the detachment today, including eleven officers. The rest have mostly resigned due to age limits.

Future Responsibilities

Currently, the mission of the White Russian Detachment is to guard the Isolated Battalion barracks on Jiaozhou Road, stand guard at the Garden Bridge, the Bund wharves, and in front of the barracks. In a few days, after being incorporated into the Police Department, it will be managed by Deputy Police Commissioner Robertson. However, the commander and uniforms will remain unchanged, and its mission, in addition to guarding the Garden Bridge, may continue as before.

### Shanghai Opera Research Association News: Opposing the Election of a Shanghai Opera Queen

Mr. Yuan, formerly of Jin Ying Radio, published a collection of Shanghai operas from across Shanghai in April of last year and launched an election for a Shanghai Opera Queen. The Shanghai Opera and Drama Research Association received letters of objection from the outside, believing that this action was initiated by the association and could belittle the personality of Shanghai opera actresses. Therefore, it issued a statement in the newspaper. Subsequently, Jin Ying Radio closed down, and the election of the Shanghai Opera Queen was halted.

The Accumulators of Nature (Part 1)   Jian Nong

Unexpectedly, due to recent fondness for reading natural science books, I inadvertently discovered the various guises and true faces of hoarding merchants. Now, let me first draw a simple outline of them, and then prove it with scientific facts. I dare say: "The so-called hoarding merchants: their bellies are large, their skin is thick, their hands are tight, their hearts are poisonous, their nature is stingy, their vision is short, and their ability to conjure up trouble from high places is divine, so they are covered in thorns, making them difficult to touch? However..." Below the word "however," I originally intended to state the ultimate result of hoarding merchants, but this result, although already an ironclad fact in the lower animal and plant kingdoms, can it ultimately be applied to us, the superior human beings among all things? I dare not assert arbitrarily for the time being and will wait for its natural evolution to the final fact to clarify. However (another however!), according to recent reports, a former mayor has already been accused of hoarding food...

   Large Belly
   In the Saharan plains of Bahia Province in Brazil, South America, there is a peculiar tree called Pavanillesia. This tree is about sixty feet tall, with a slender tip and a large middle trunk, resembling a wine barrel or vase. Because it lives in arid areas with scarce rainfall and water sources, it has no choice but to absorb and hoard as much water as possible during the rainy season or from deep underground to sustain the prolonged dry season. Over time, it has swollen its trunk to this extent! On top of it sits a few sparse branches, which grow a few pitiful little leaves during the rainy season, but wither during drought, becoming completely barren! Meanwhile, on the Australian continent, there is a tree similar to the one mentioned above: its French name is Arbre-Boutcille, and its English name is Bottle-tree, which can truly be translated as "Bottle Tree." I believe that these two types of trees are the common forms of pot-bellied hoarding merchants.

   Thick Skin
   Plants in barren and desert areas, because of the scarcity and preciousness of water, must find ways to hoard it. Once hoarded, they fear its rapid and excessive loss due to evaporation, so they ingeniously thicken their skin, turning it into leather; fearing that this is not sufficient, they also paint a layer of glue or wax on the outside. In this way, they completely block the gateways for water evaporation, hang up a "No Through Road" sign, and can safely enjoy their hoarded goods. An excellent example is a plant called Welwitsehia Mirabilis in the Kalahari Desert of South Africa. Its trunk is woody and only five inches tall; it blooms around the crown, producing round, hard, small red balls. It has two enormous, leather-like leaves that are even tougher than cowhide, with the ends split into many small strips about three feet long. It uses this thick skin, which cannot be broken by swords or knives, to fight against the scorching sun and blistering heat! I believe that these leathery leaves resemble the skin of hoarding merchants, who, regardless of the ridicule of society and the sanctions of public opinion, simply present a stern face and turn a deaf ear, defying anyone to do anything about it!

   When we see the two leathery and waxy leaves of Welwitschia lirolbilis, we can see how they preserve the hoarded items, being meticulous and unwilling to leave any gaps! It should not be excessive to compare this to the two hands of hoarding merchants, who are unwilling to easily let go of their goods until death, adding the adjective "tight" to describe them.

   Poisonous Heart
   Among insects, the one that most likes to hoard and is most beneficial to us is probably the honeybee that gathers nectar and makes honey. Their diligent hoarding is well known and does not need to be described at length, I am now only discussing their poisonous heart. I remember reading in the Zuo Zhuan when I was young: "Bees and wasps are poisonous, let alone a state?" I thought that the poison referred to was only the sting on their tail. I never imagined that after studying their way of life, I would understand that their hearts are especially vicious. According to Thomson's Outline of Science, the hive of bees, because of hoarding, fearing that they cannot enjoy their hoarded goods alone in winter, engage in the killing of their own kind: "...Once the order is issued that those who do not work shall not eat or live, the slaughter of the male bees begins: the hardworking female bees bravely and ruthlessly kill all the male bees." In this case, isn't the heart of the bee poisonous? Hoarding merchants, only caring about their own interests, allow countless compatriots to die of hunger and cold due to their own sins, not only do they not feel any compassion or pity, but they intensify their killing work. What are their hearts made of?
The Same Tune Played Differently   KK

The Sorrow of Being a Younger Brother in the Family   Liao Liao

   The north wind is blowing outside the window, and the wires are constantly whistling. Inside the room, however, the stove is burning, strangely warm, and the mercury column on the thermometer rises high.

   Yet, the younger brother still feels cold, the cold clock ticks with cold steps, cold tears drip on the cold little face, lonely and cold time, ah, the younger brother sits on the cold chair and cries.

   The crying is lonely, not like the crying of a six-year-old child. Tears stream down from the corners of his eyes, creating many small streams on his face, the small streams surge down, and the table is like a rainy day road.

   Looking around, it is still the same old thing: a bright dressing table, a glowing red stove, a nude portrait on the wall, a pile of worn-out leather shoes under the table, messy coats on the coat rack... There is nothing fun, nothing new, everything is dozing off, and the younger brother begins to yawn too.

   But the loud laughter of the maid and the cook downstairs awakens his hazy memory, and he remembers what his mother said before leaving: "Ah Nan, take good care of the house, don't let the maids and cooks come upstairs, be careful they steal everything. When Mom comes back with the banknotes at night, she will surely give you milk candies." The younger brother's eyes open wider and wider, and he sees the annoying furniture around him again.

   "Bang!" The younger brother is startled, the door is rudely pushed open, and his father comes in, his face red, his brows furrowed.

   "Dad!" The younger brother calls timidly, but receives only a muffled "hm" sound.

   Picking up the telephone receiver, his father asks tensely:

   "Hello, ... what is the market like now? ... Hm? Sniff!" After putting down the receiver, his father's face becomes even gloomier, he puts on his coat and steps out quickly.

   The younger brother, his mind finally settled, sits blankly, suddenly the door opens again, and his elder brother runs in with a gaudily dressed woman.

   "Better hurry, Xiao Li and the others are anxiously waiting at the Paramount."

   "Uh, of course, I'll take some money and go." The elder brother rummages through his mother's leather suitcase, pulls out a large stack of banknotes, and then leaves with the woman in his arms...

   Quietly, quietly, the younger brother becomes lonely again, looking at the annoying surroundings, and a sudden chill overcomes him, although the stove is still burning red.

   It's late, he swallows a few balls of rice alone, and then climbs into bed alone, still feeling cold and lonely in his dreams...

   Suddenly, a strange noise awakens him, it turns out to be his mother's crying, mixed with his father's angry scolding, and his elder brother's high-pitched singing coming from the next room.

   "Hey, eldest brother, do you want a candied hawthorn?" Zhao Yukun suddenly scurries in like a mouse, jumps with both legs, throws off the cotton shoes on his feet, and flips twice onto the pit, holding a string of candied hawthorns in each hand.

   He throws one string to Yuhua, while pretending to throw the other string to Yuqin, but only makes an empty gesture, instead putting it into his own mouth.

   "I'll share it with you!" Yuhua says to Yuqin with a smile.

   "I can't be the host and not eat myself!" Yukun says shamelessly, making a funny face at the same time.

   The eldest and third brothers laugh.

   "Second brother, the money the master gave you for snacks, I see you never have enough to spend, right?" Yuhua asks, biting off a candied hawthorn.

   "I wouldn't steal from you, would I!" Yukun lies down straight on his back, facing the roof tiles.

   "Good brother, don't keep talking to me!" Yukun leaps up, performs a carp flip, and stands up silently. "Be careful if the master finds out, he'll tell me not to think about sneaking out at night anymore..."

   The three were talking spiritedly when suddenly a long, horse-faced face peers in from outside the door, it is Mr. Yu, who is in charge of supervising them in the lodging.

   "Everyone, go to the east courtyard! The people delivering the leather hats are here."

   Yuhua immediately throws away the candied hawthorn in his hand and strides out. Yukun is also busy jumping down from the pit; only Yuqin feels very hesitant, like a prisoner about to go to court.

   "Second brother," he whispers in Yukun's ear as they walk towards the entrance of the east courtyard, "You go and stand close to the eldest brother. If he is about to lose his temper, you must stop him."

   "I understand!" The second brother answers with confusion.

   Ninety-odd students, all dressed alike, stand neatly in four rows, all looking very excited, secretly guessing the quality of the gifts they are about to receive; only Yuhua and Yuqin have different feelings in their hearts.
(8) A Striving Outlook on Life (7)

   Hope is shattered due to insufficient and improper struggle. Struggle is not an ordinary thing, one must use one's ability, exert one's ability, and use it skillfully. Then, what was once a dead end will now be a new opportunity. In short, hope always exists and will not truly disappear. Shattering is like disappearing, but it has never truly disappeared.

Norma Shearer in Retirement   Si Hua

   Norma Shearer, the leading actress in famous films such as "The Divorcee" and "A Free Soul," retired for a period after her husband's death. "Women" was her first work to change her style when she made a comeback, but she faded into obscurity again after its release and retired once more. American Outlook magazine recently published an interview with her, excerpts of which are translated below for readers who love movies. It seems that there are two Norma Shearers, one from Montreal, a famous city in Canada, who embraced her ambition and entered the film industry, struggling with the environment. Fortunately, she was not rejected. The other is married to Irving Thalberg, the once-prominent MGM mogul. The first film contract she signed after entering the film industry was signed by him. He created Norma Shearer as the most happy and successful wife, mother, and actress in Hollywood. In 1936, Irving Thalberg passed away, and she temporarily withdrew from the film industry.

   In 1938, Norma Shearer returned to the screen, and rumors arose about her position. At the same time, people speculated about the reorganization of MGM's core. Although this caused her displeasure, it was not enough to hurt her. What ordinary actresses could not cope with, the mistress of MGM solved without any problems.

   A photographer from Outlook magazine recently conducted a lifestyle interview with her and discovered that she was like an uninhibited child when she was at home, preparing to climb a tree. When she was photographed, every pose was beautiful and lovely, without any request or manipulation from the reporter. Her residence is built in Monica, California, facing the Pacific Ocean, and is a famous scenic spot. Her swimming pool is arguably the largest in the area. A small boat is provided in the pool, and she often rows in it. At one end of the pool, there is another children's play area, similar in size, but the water is only deep enough for a five-year-old child to stand up. This is specially designed for her five-year-old daughter, Katherine, and her eleven-year-old son, Irving. The layout of her lounge, study, and bedroom is truly elegant and appropriate, without any flaws. She only changed a few small things from what Irving Thalberg and she displayed when they built this new house eleven years ago, while still maintaining most of the original state. In addition to hiring eight servants to clean the house and grounds, she only has a private maid, a secretary, and a tutor, unlike the luxurious households of other wealthy women with rows of maids and clouds of servants.

   Her study contains three Oscar statues, two of which were won by her husband. Some stars use Oscar statues as bathroom door decorations, but she cherishes them very much. On the table is a photo of her and her husband, and on another table is a portrait of George Raft (she is no longer reunited with Raft). Her daughter is named Katherine to admire the famous actor Cornell, and her son is named Irving because the child hopes to succeed like his respected father in his memory when he grows up. The reporter requested to take pictures of the children, but was not allowed, because the children belong to Mrs. Irving Thalberg and not Miss Norma Shearer!

   After the agreement, Muzhai exhausted all means to gather five thousand taels of silver and handed it to Liu Rushi to take away. He said, "It's not that I am unwilling to open my purse generously, but I really don't have any savings. You know that completely. Please tell Yuqi that I, Qian, have done my best. Please ask him to launch the uprising properly and never act rashly, lest he bring disaster upon himself." Liu Rushi also gathered all the jewelry and private savings in her dowry, amounting to ten thousand gold, and hid it in her luggage. She disguised herself as a man, quietly bid farewell to Muzhai, and set off with Shi Da. The gloomy Qian Muzhai had to marvel at the courage and enthusiasm of Hedong Jun. Liu Rushi followed Shi Da, first took a small boat to Jiangyin, and then to the riverbank, boarded the seagoing ship Shi Da had sailed over, and set off from the mouth of the Yangtze River. Although she was carrying gold and silver, she was not afraid because she had Shi Da's protection. The seagoing ship sailed past Chongming and approached a small island in Zhejiang Province when they encountered Huang Yuqi's naval force. Liu Rushi saw sails like clouds and spears gleaming in the sun from afar, and was overjoyed. Shi Da ordered the boat to sail closer to the righteous army and inform Huang Yuqi. Huang Yuqi immediately invited Madam Liu to come aboard for a meeting. When Shi Da helped Rushi step onto the warship, the guards on both sides stood in a row, saluting. When Liu Rushi saw Yuqi, because she was dressed as a man, she bowed deeply and said, "General Huang, have you been well since we last met? I am overjoyed to see the righteous army today." Huang Yuqi, upon seeing Liu Rushi's arrival, was amazed. He hastily prepared a banquet on the ship to entertain her and inquired about Muzhai's recent situation. Rushi truthfully explained the use of the money to reward the righteous army. Although Huang Yuqi was somewhat dissatisfied with Muzhai, he saw Liu Rushi's enthusiasm for patriotism, which was rare among women, and was very respectful. Shi Da also sat beside them.
(34) Essentials of Cultivation (11)

   A person's private life must be very strict. People who live a romantic life not only waste their energy for no reason and cannot concentrate on public affairs, but also spend more money, inevitably leading to financial difficulties. All the results of indiscretion and depravity are caused by a romantic private life.

The Annual "Association Performance"   Wei Xiu

   In the past, Shanghai theaters, before closing for the Lunar New Year holidays, would always put on a "Association Performance" with a large combination of acting troupes as a year-end amusement; the storytelling circles also had this custom, always holding an annual "Association Performance" at the end of the year.

   The original purpose of holding an "Association Performance" included two main functions: one was charitable, and the other was competitive.

   Guangyu Society had long-term relief measures for the poor relatives of its members, and it also established a school to educate the children of its members. Employees usually had to extract a certain percentage of their income to donate to these charitable causes, and the income from the "Association Performance" was the main source of these funds. Because in holding an "Association Performance", the employees and theater owners were not allowed to take any fees, and all income belonged to the society, which was allocated as a fund for charitable causes.

   The society members were usually scattered everywhere, and there were few opportunities to gather. The "Association Performance" provided an opportunity for all members to gather once a year and to compete with each other to improve their skills; while the rising stars and the previously unknown employees could often use this opportunity to show their talents. Many of the big names in Shanghai today, such as Xu Jixiang, Zhang Hongsheng, and Xia Hesheng, became famous after singing well at the "Association Performance" and were then known as big names.

   Now, at the "Association Performance" held in Shanghai theaters, the theater owners and employees split the accounts in the same way as usual, and the activities of the theaters are always monopolized by these familiar faces. Therefore, the two original functions of charity and competition have completely disappeared; moreover, the number of acts is lengthened without limit, and the seat prices are deliberately raised, which is even closer to "profiteering."
