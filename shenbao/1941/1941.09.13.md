### Large Numbers of American Warships Ordered to Deploy to Search for German and Italian Vessels; President Roosevelt Announces Major Steps, Close Cooperation with Allied Naval and Air Forces

United Press, New York, 12th: It is estimated that several hundred warships are now implementing President Roosevelt's orders. In effect, our forces will closely cooperate with the British and Allied navies and aircraft. This means our warships and aircraft will use British and Allied bases at any time and anywhere. The majority of our forces will naturally use battleships or enter the Mediterranean Sea and other sea areas. According to President Roosevelt's orders, our military commanders will independently and jointly with the British search for German and Italian ships. The large-scale maritime search we are currently engaged in will be largely limited to routes transporting Lend-Lease military supplies to Britain and South Africa, as well as routes in the Pacific Ocean to Vladivostok, Rangoon, and the Red Sea. Routes to Australia and from Australia to Singapore, India, and African ports may also require limited patrols.

### Full Text of Roosevelt's Speech

Reuters, Washington, 12th: In his eagerly awaited broadcast last night, President Roosevelt warned Germany and Italy that their warships would face danger if they entered the American defense sea lanes. He said, "I have issued instructions to the commanders-in-chief of the U.S. Army and Navy to implement this policy immediately. The full responsibility rests with Germany. There will be no shooting unless Germany continues to provoke it." The President stated that a German submarine first fired at the American destroyer Greer, intending to sink it. This is a fact, and from a legal and moral standpoint, it constitutes an act of piracy. This is not an isolated incident but part of an overall plan. In July, a submarine in North American territorial waters followed an American warship, attempting to position itself for an attack. Its periscope was clearly visible. At that time, there were no British or American submarines within a hundred miles, so the nationality of this submarine was evident. Nazi submarines are the rattlesnakes of the Mediterranean, and now is the time for active defense." The President continued, "We have not sought a shooting war with Hitler, and we still do not want to seek one. But we also do not want to seek peace at the cost of allowing our naval vessels to be attacked by Hitler while performing their duties. The Nazis want to abolish freedom of the seas and seize absolute control of the oceans. This is an act of lawlessness. If the Nazis were to seize control of the oceans, their second step would be evident: to control the United States and the Western Hemisphere by force. I have no illusions about the seriousness of this step. It is unavoidable for the protection of the nation. The invincibility of the U.S. Navy is only true when the British Navy exists. The traditional policy of American maritime freedom still applies, not only in the Atlantic but also in the Pacific and other oceans. American defense vessels will again wait for the Axis powers to attack first."

Reuters, Washington, 12th: The full text of President Roosevelt's broadcast is as follows: "According to a report from the U.S. Navy Department, the American destroyer Greer, while en route to Iceland in broad daylight, was attacked on the morning of September 4th at a location southeast of Greenland. The ship was carrying U.S. mail to Iceland, flying the American flag, and its identity as an American vessel was unmistakable. At that time, the ship was attacked by a submarine, which Germany admits was a German submarine. The submarine deliberately fired one torpedo at the Greer, followed by another, to launch an attack. Despite the fabrications of Hitler's propaganda machine and the willingness of some anti-American groups to believe their words, I must inform you of the blunt facts: the German submarine fired on this American destroyer without warning, intending to sink it. Our destroyer was sailing in the area of self-defense declared by the U.S. government, the American protective outposts in the Atlantic. We have established outposts in Iceland, Greenland, Labrador, and Newfoundland in the north. Many ships flying the flags of various nations sail through this sea, carrying food and other supplies for civilians, and war materials. These war materials were created by the American people at the cost of billions of dollars and declared necessary by the actions of Congress to defend their own land."

### Policy of Attacking American Ships is an Act of Piracy

When the American destroyer was attacked, it was fulfilling its legitimate mission. If the submarine could see the destroyer when it fired the torpedoes, then the attack was a deliberate attempt by the Nazis to sink a clearly identifiable American warship. If, on the other hand, the submarine was submerged, unwilling to take the trouble to ascertain the nationality of the ship, and fired torpedoes based on sounds picked up by hydrophones, as claimed in the German communiqué, then the attack is even more brutal, as it indicates a policy of indiscriminate destruction against any ship at sea, whether belligerent or non-belligerent. This is an act of piracy. From a legal and moral standpoint, this is not the first or the last act of piracy committed by the Nazi government against the American flag in this war. Attacks have occurred one after another. A month ago, the American-flagged merchant ship Robin Moor, sailing in the mid-South Atlantic, was sunk by a Nazi submarine in a situation violating established international law and humanitarian principles. The ship's passengers and crew were forced into open boats hundreds of miles from land. This is a direct violation of international treaties signed by the German government. The Nazi government has not offered an apology, claimed it was a mistake, or offered compensation for the losses. In July 1941, an American warship sailing in North American waters was followed by a submarine, which for a long time tried to position itself for an attack. Its periscope was visible above the surface. At that time, there were no British or American submarines within hundreds of miles, so the nationality of this submarine was evident. Five days ago, we learned that the merchant ship Sessa, flying the flag of our sister republic, Panama, had been sunk. Only three survivors remain. On August 17th, the ship was attacked without warning, first by a torpedo and then bombarded near Greenland. It was carrying supplies for the civilian population of Iceland. It is now feared that the other sailors on board have drowned. The fact that German submarines were operating in that area has been confirmed, so there is no reasonable doubt about the nationality of the attacking submarine. Five days ago, another American merchant ship, the Steel Seafarer, while sailing to a port in Egypt, was sunk by a German aircraft in the Red Sea, 220 miles south of Suez. A total of four ships flying the American flag have been definitively confirmed as sunk or lost, two of which were U.S. Navy warships. The fifth ship sunk clearly flew the flag of Panama. We Americans are now standing firm in the face of this situation. The form of our democratic civilization has fostered a feeling that any nation that commits an act of piracy against one of our ships must be at war with us. We are not now panicked or losing our sense of balance, so what I am thinking and saying now is not about any incidental details. We Americans are now taking a long-term view of certain fundamental principles and the succession of events on land and sea. This must be seen as a whole and as part of world events.

### Nazi Conspiracy and Deception Exposed

A great nation does not deign to exaggerate a minor incident or become uncontrollably angry over an act of violence, but the evidence in this case is conclusive and shows that it is not accidental but part of an overall plan. Therefore, it would be an unpardonable folly to underestimate its impact. The important truth is that this kind of international lawlessness exposes a plan that the American people have long understood: the Nazi plan to abolish freedom of the seas and seize absolute control of the oceans. Once that control is in their hands, the next step, to control the United States and the Western Hemisphere by force, can proceed unhindered. With the ocean under Nazi control, the Americans or any American republic

Editorial

### Initial Completion of Foreign Exchange Controls

The freezing of funds by Britain and the United States, after a month of arrangements, is now showing signs of progress. This also relies on the persuasive efforts of the British and American governments. Otherwise, the black market exchange rates, with mutual exploitation, could never be eliminated. However, whether this elimination can proceed without complications and be fully implemented remains to be seen and proven by facts. It is still too early to expect it. However, the matter is not difficult. What is called foreign exchange in the market is actually only one type: the U.S. dollar. The clearing of U.S. dollars should be controlled by the New York market. Without exceptions, all inflows and outflows are subject to its control. There is no need to worry about stray U.S. dollars, and there is no room for division. Therefore, the receipt and disbursement of foreign exchange in Shanghai only require British and American banks to have the determination to maintain and promote it. Even if one wants to cause trouble, it is difficult to achieve. If the black market is completely eliminated, and the foreign exchange receipts and disbursements are centrally managed by the Exchange Stabilization Fund, those who believe that the legal tender has lost its freedom to buy and sell foreign exchange and has therefore lost all its value are greatly mistaken. The exchange of legal tender for British and American currencies does not depend on whether buying and selling is free or restricted to increase or decrease its value. After being controlled, there can be a fixed exchange rate, unlike the black market, which changes in an instant. Some say that because only a portion of goods can be settled in foreign exchange, the legal tender only has a portion of its function. This is also a convoluted argument. The fact that a portion of goods can be settled in foreign exchange and a portion cannot is a matter of selecting goods, not a matter of the effectiveness of the legal tender. The legal tender does not specify that a certain portion can buy foreign exchange and a certain portion cannot. As long as it is legal tender, all of it can be used to purchase foreign exchange. This is the true value of the legal tender, meaning that every bill has the potential to purchase foreign exchange. Moreover, because of the elimination of the black market, the exchange rate is pegged at a reasonable level, and therefore prices can also be maintained at a reasonable standard. This is of great benefit to stabilizing people's livelihoods.

Now, the goods supplied with foreign exchange are extraordinarily broad, not only considering the lives of the people of Shanghai but also their enjoyment, not only considering the materials for industrial operations but also the machinery for industrial development. However, those who are extravagant in their own consumption and unwilling to spend a penny for public service, those who only seek enjoyment and disregard public welfare, still think it is not enough. Those who seek to profit through arbitrage feel inconvenienced and constantly think of undermining it. Even those who speculate and manipulate also feel that the elimination of the black market makes their actions inconvenient and harbor jealousy and resentment. These are all generated from outside and cannot be reasoned with human emotion or rationality. In the future, the trend of prices will be less influenced by currency values and more influenced by artificial manipulation. For example, (1) goods that are not supplied with foreign exchange will inevitably rise arbitrarily to facilitate hoarding and speculation; (2) even knowing that there is a supply, they will also use the prices of goods not supplied as an example to raise prices step by step; (3) those who demand goods do not know which goods sold in the market should be cheap and which are expensive, so distributors can still use their usual tricks to muddy the waters. If so, the so-called foreign exchange control still benefits industry and commerce at the expense of the people's livelihood. Although the purpose of control is not for prices, the effect of control also includes adjusting prices. If the facts are indeed like this, it is regrettable.

Therefore, it is believed that the items listed in Schedule A, such as rice, coal, and petroleum products, are essential for daily life. On the one hand, they must be supplied with foreign exchange, and on the other hand, their prices should also be controlled. For example, since the Shanghai Municipal Council has been selling rice publicly, perhaps due to cost factors, the publicly set price is sometimes higher than the market price, leading to the malpractice of mixing low-quality rice with publicly sold rice to sell for profit. This still seems to be a technical issue of procurement and sales and is not enough to be a problem with publicly sold rice. Since the Municipal Council's rice came into existence, it has indeed made it difficult for the rice market to be manipulated effectively, and the adjustment of rice prices has made some progress. Its contribution cannot be denied. Therefore, the foreign exchange supplied for imported rice should be limited to the rice sold publicly by the Municipal Council so that the Municipal Council has the real power to control food in the concession! Because the Municipal Council operates rice sales not for profit, its goal is not to make money. To gain the trust of the public, the Municipal Council should also publish the amount of rice ordered in batches, the cost of the assessment, and the profit or loss of the sales situation every month or every period to demonstrate trustworthiness and silence the mouths of unscrupulous merchants. Coal briquettes made from briquettes and coal dust have become the only fuel in the city. Next is kerosene, and a portion is used for lighting. In addition, there is bituminous coal for factory food and coal dust for cooked water shops, all of which have a deep relationship with people's daily lives. The traditional sales method of foreign firms and coal merchants is to sell in bulk and not focus on retail sales, which uses warehouse receipts and puts the coal into the hands of wealthy hoarders and coal merchants. Real consumers, when they have a need, cannot obtain it or obtain it at an exorbitant price, and the great profit goes to the merchants, while the harm extends to the poor. Now that foreign exchange is supplied, prices should be stabilized, and the distribution method should be reformed. The only way to do this is to stop the trading of warehouse receipts to prevent manipulation and hoarding. The only way is to focus on the current sales of door-to-door shops to prevent stores from profiting at the expense of others. The only way is to also meet the needs of users. Then, it can actually enter the hands of consumers and reduce the burden of general life. Kerosene is not as important as coal, but it is still a daily necessity for the people. Since coal has become expensive, more and more small families use kerosene for cooking, and because electricity is expensive, many are switching to kerosene lamps. The price of kerosene seems to be restrained by the kerosene companies, unlike the wild jumps in coal prices, but it is still more than ten times what it used to be. Therefore, efforts should be made to distribute it to consumers in a fair manner, and the high profits should not be used for the extravagance of hoarders. Tobacco leaves are merely for consumption, but they are listed alongside rice and coal, which is only for the enjoyment of the general public and the businesses of British and American friendly nations. However, when allocating foreign exchange, they should not be treated equally with rice and coal.

As for the position of legal tender, it is a matter of deep concern to the general public. In fact, it is more worrying about whether the loopholes are closed than worrying about them not being closed. This does not require deep discussion. Just ask about family expenses and managing a household economically. Spending one less penny will save one more penny of the property they hold. On the contrary, if they spend without restraint, their property will decrease day by day and eventually go bankrupt. What's more, if they don't spend enough for themselves and also supply it to others, exhaustion can be expected soon. When they realize that spending is inappropriate and think about budgeting and preventing others from encroaching, then only strict receipts and disbursements will not be in vain. If receipts and disbursements are strict, and consumption is limited, should they worry that the value of the property is not as high as before? Therefore, the value of legal tender, after the success of this foreign exchange control, will become more solid. The value will rise without asking, and they will see the coming of success and know that worrying is unnecessary.  merchant ships, unable to rely on the freedom to do any peaceful commerce except by relying on the despotic power of that foreign nation. The Atlantic, which had been and would always be the channel of our freedom and friendship, would thus become a deadly threat to American commerce, American seacoasts, and American inland cities. The Hitler government, in violation of maritime law and the publicly recognized rights enjoyed by other nations, has declared a vast area of the ocean, including even the vast waters in the Western Hemisphere, to be blockaded. Ships may not enter that area for any reason without risking being sunk. If the military actually now arbitrarily sinks ships in a wide area, both within and far beyond the self-declared blockade zone, without warning, this Nazi attempt to seize control of the oceans is only a coordinated part of the Nazi conspiracy to implement in its entirety in the Western Hemisphere. Everything is moving towards the same goal. The vanguards of Hitler, not only his acknowledged secret agents but also the quislings he has placed among us, have prepared footholds and bridgeheads in the New World for him to use once he seizes control of the oceans.

The U.S. government is fully aware of Hitler's conspiracy and deceptions in this New World. Coup plots have occurred one after another. Last year, there was an attempt to seize the government of Uruguay, which was fortunately thwarted by that country's swift and decisive action, with full assistance from its American neighbors. Not long ago, there was another attempt to foment unrest in Argentina, which was thwarted by that government's meticulous and clever efforts in various locations. Not long ago, there was also an attempt to undermine the government of Bolivia. In recent weeks, secret landing strips for aircraft have been discovered in several locations within the borders of Colombia near the Panama Canal.

### U.S. Determined to Exert Every Effort to Maintain Freedom of the Seas

I can cite many more cases. Hitler knows that to succeed as the master of the world, he must seize control of the oceans. He must first destroy the bridge of ships that we have built across the Atlantic, on which we continuously transport war materials to help Britain eliminate its people and all its works. He must remove our patrols on the sea and in the sky. He must silence the British Navy. The American people, believing that the U.S. Navy is capable of protecting the country and is invincible, must be repeatedly reminded that this is only effective if the British Navy survives. This is simple arithmetic. If the world outside the Americas were destroyed under the Axis powers, the Axis countries would enjoy the shipbuilding facilities of all of Europe, the British Isles, and the Far East, far surpassing all the shipbuilding facilities and potential of the Americas. Not only would it surpass them, but it would also be two or three times greater. At that time, even if the United States devoted all its resources to dealing with this situation, seeking to double or redouble our navy, the manpower and resources of the Axis countries controlling the rest of the world would still be able to build many times more than us. It is time for all Americans in the Americas to end their illusion that the Americas can continue to live a happy and peaceful life in a Nazi-controlled world. The United States has fought for the policy of freedom of the seas throughout its history. This policy is very simple, but fundamentally important. Its meaning is that no country has the right to prevent other countries from safely conducting commerce in the vast oceans of the world, far from the battlefields on land. This is our policy, and it has been repeatedly proven throughout our history. Our policy has been implemented from time immemorial to the present, and it will continue to be implemented in the future, not only in the Atlantic but also in the Pacific and other oceans. The unrestricted submarine warfare of 1941 has become a blatant act of aggression against American policy. Hitler has begun his war to dominate the oceans with violence and by sweeping aside all international law and humanity. His intention is very clear. The American people can no longer have any illusions about this. All the sweet whispers of the appeasers that Hitler is not interested in the Western Hemisphere and the lullabies that the ocean will protect us from Hitler's aggression can no longer have any influence on the clear-headed, far-sighted, and realistic American people.

### Defend Defensive Bastions at Any Cost

Because of the above-mentioned events, because of the actions of German ships, and because of the repeatedly clear evidence of the German government's disrespect for treaties or international law and its disregard for neutral nations or human life, we Americans are now faced with cruel facts, not abstract theories. The attack on the Greer is not a localized military action in the Atlantic. It is not merely an encounter in a conflict between two countries but a step towards creating a perpetual world order based on armed intimidation and massacre. I know that the Nazis are even now watching to see if the United States will silently signal a green light and allow them to continue on their path of destruction. The danger to our Western Hemisphere from the Nazis is no longer just a possibility but has arrived, not only from military enemies but also from enemies of all laws, all freedoms, and all religions. The time has come when you and I must see the cold necessity and warn this inhuman, unrestrained seeker of world domination for profit, "You want to place our children in your way of terror and slavery. Now that you have attacked our security, we cannot allow you to go any further." Ordinary diplomatic practices, such as documents, are useless when dealing with international thugs who destroy our ships and kill our people. Peaceful nations have been harmed one after another simply because they failed to recognize the Nazi danger before their throats were strangled. The United States does not want to repeat this mistake. No act of violence or intimidation can prevent us from maintaining the integrity of our two great defensive bastions: one, the supply lines of raw materials to the enemies of Hitler; and two, the freedom of our shipping on the high seas. Whatever action is required, whatever the cost, we must keep the legal trade lines in this defensive ocean open at all times. We have not sought a shooting war with Hitler, and we do not seek one now. But we also do not want to seek peace at the cost of allowing Hitler to attack our warships and merchant ships engaged in legitimate business. I believe that German leaders may not pay close attention to what we Americans say about them. We cannot bring about the downfall of Nazism with long-distance insults, but if you see a rattlesnake about to attack you, you must destroy it before it can inflict its venom. Nazi submarines and plunderers are the rattlesnakes of the Atlantic. They are a danger to the free armies on the high seas. They are a challenge to our sovereignty. Their attacks on ships flying the American flag are trampling on our most precious rights. The American flag is a symbol of our independence, our freedom, and our lives. All of us Americans understand that the time has come for Americans to defend themselves. If we allow the Nazis to continue attacking us in our own territorial waters or in the ocean where they can continue to attack us, it will weaken America's ability to reject Hitlerism. Let us not make too fine a distinction. Let us not, after the fifth or tenth or twentieth attack, ask ourselves when we should begin to defend ourselves. In fact, the time for active self-defense has come. Let us not split hairs. Let us not say, "We might as well wait until a torpedo has sunk an American ship or the crew and passengers have drowned before we try to defend ourselves." It is time to prevent attacks.

### Discovery of Axis Warships - Impart a Fatal Blow Immediately

Submarines or pirate ships can attack in the open sea, and they can also attack close to our coasts. Their appearance in the Americas, regarded as seas vital to defense, constitutes an attack. Our American ships and aircraft, in what we consider necessary for defense at sea, will no longer wait for Axis submarines lurking underwater or Axis pirate ships floating on the surface to strike the first fatal blow. Currently, our large naval and air patrols patrolling the vast Atlantic Ocean are responsible for the policy of freedom of the seas for the Americas. In simple and clear terms, this means that our patrolling warships and aircraft will protect all merchant ships. All vessels operating in our defensive waters and engaging in commerce, not only those flying the American flag but also those flying any national flag, are under protection. We will protect them from attacks by submarines and pirate ships. This situation is not new. The second U.S. President Adams once ordered the U.S. Navy to eliminate European warships harassing our Caribbean and South American seas and destroying our commerce. And the third President Jefferson also ordered the U.S. Navy to stop attacks by North African pirates on American ships. My responsibility as President is historical, obvious, and unavoidable. Our decision to protect the seas necessary for the defense of the Americas is not an act of war on our part. Our actions are not aggression, but defense. However, this warning should be made clear.

### Military Affairs Commission Releases - Weekly War Situation

From September 5th to 11th - Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission discussed the war situation for the week (September 5th to 11th). The recapture of Fuzhou City is the most noteworthy. Secondly, the Japanese army's rampant harassment in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border area, the Chinese army's attacks and harassment in the Jinan triangle area, and the Chinese army's enticement of the Japanese army to penetrate deeply into Dayun Mountain in northern Hunan are also briefly reported. The details are described below:

(Recapture of) Fuzhou (and other places): (1) On the night of the 2nd, the Chinese army launched a multi-pronged attack on Fuzhou, capturing the entrance by midnight. The Japanese army in Fuzhou boarded ships one after another and began to retreat eastward on the morning of the 3rd. On the morning of the 3rd, the Chinese army entered Fuzhou City and continued to pursue eastward, capturing Mawei at 3 PM. (2) Fuqing, on the south bank of the Min River, was captured and then lost again, and finally, on the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese army was driven out of the city and retreated from the estuary by ship. Changle was also recovered at the same time. (3) Lianjiang, on the north bank of the Min River, was also captured by the Chinese army on the morning of the 3rd. The Japanese army retreated to Changmen and Guanwangtou on the riverbank. (4) The Japanese army, which landed at Sandu Ao on August 30th, attempted to抄襲 [pinyin: chāoxí; meaning to plagiarize or copy] the rear of the Chinese field army outside Fuzhou, fought with the Chinese army until noon on the 3rd, and also boarded Japanese ships and retreated.

(Jiangsu-Zhejiang) Border Area: In the previous offensive by the various field armies on the East China battlefield, the damage inflicted on the Japanese army was greater in the attacks on Changxing and Wukang. In order to retaliate, the Japanese army gathered more than 4,000 troops and launched attacks from Changxing, Wuxing, and Wukang in three directions westward towards the Chinese Northern Jiangsu field army's location. The northern route of the Japanese army, with more than 1,000 troops, passed through Lincheng Bridge to Guantai from Weixing at 6 PM on the 31st, and on the morning of the 1st, turned south to attack Meixi Town, and at the same time attacked Guanyintang in the north of Anji County, but was blocked. On the evening of the 2nd, they turned southeast and attacked Qiankeng Bridge. The central route of the Japanese army, with more than 1,000 troops, launched attacks from Changxing in the afternoon of the 1st in separate groups westward towards Gangkou and Heping towns, then converged to attack Wucun, and continued to reinforce with more than 1,000 troops, attacking Xiaozhen westward at noon on the 2nd, and also turned south to Qiankeng Bridge in the evening to join the northern route and attack the Chinese army. The northern route of the Japanese army, with more than 1,000 troops, attacked Paitou Town westward from Wukang at 6 PM on the 2nd as a supporting force. The Chinese army relied on the advantageous terrain around Qiankeng Bridge, waited for the Japanese to arrive, and launched a fierce attack. One group that attacked Chiwucun was also surrounded by the Chinese army. Fighting until the afternoon of the 3rd, the Japanese army at Qiankeng Bridge could not hold out and retreated southeast towards Wukang. The group at Chiwucun also broke through the encirclement and retreated. The Chinese army pursued them in separate routes.

(Jinan) Triangle Area: On the evening of the 28th of last month, a part of the Japanese army in Ruicheng attacked Wangyao Village and Fozi Village to the north, and in the morning moved east through Dongxishan and Yangjia Village to attack Majia Yao and Yongxing Yao. In the afternoon of the 29th, the Japanese army in Monan Town moved west through Shihe Yao and joined the attack. In the evening, the Japanese army in Yuxiang and Qinghua Towns also moved south, attempting to encircle the Chinese army. The Chinese army met the enemy on different routes and fought fiercely for three days, driving back the Japanese army. At midnight on the 20th, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched an attack on the area from Yanhe Yue Village to Renjiadian southwest of Ruicheng, destroying the Japanese army's communication equipment. Five Japanese ammunition vehicles touched Chinese mines at Renjiadian and were completely destroyed. On the morning of the 3rd, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on Dali Village, a Japanese stronghold south of Yanchi. Fighting until noon, the Japanese army could not hold out and retreated to the south of the village. Subsequently, more than 1,000 Japanese troops reinforced in four routes, one route from Anyi via the east, one route from Yuncheng via Yanchi, one route from Balu via Fengxiekou, and one route from Zhangcun via Dalangmiao, attempting to encircle the Chinese army. After fierce fighting by the Chinese, the Japanese formation was completely scattered. The Chinese army has now shifted from the inner line to the outer line and is counterattacking the Japanese.

(Northern Hunan) Chinese Army Entices Japanese to Deeply Penetrate Dayun Mountain: More than 10,000 Japanese troops in northern Hunan began to harass on the 7th. One group attacked Nanshan Yanling from Zhongfang, one group attacked Jipoling from Taolin Xitang to the south, and another group went to the Shenjiashan area on the southern foothills of Nanchong Gantian, attempting to encircle and annihilate the Chinese field army in Dayun Mountain. The Chinese army took advantage of the terrain to lure the Japanese into the mountains, shifting from the core to launch a counter-encirclement against the Japanese. From midnight on the 8th, they launched a fierce battle against the Japanese. In addition,

(Northern Jiangxi) More than 20 Japanese troops in Anyi also harassed in separate groups on the morning of the 3rd. One group attempted to cross the Tie Long Pass to the south and attacked Songbu, and one group forcibly crossed the Huangjia Zhou and harassed Yanzhi Mountain. On the 6th, the Chinese army once captured Songbu, but the Japanese army reinforced and counterattacked. Currently, the Chinese and Japanese armies are fighting in the Jiulong Xiao area.

### Authorities Will Consider Adjusting Exchange Rates

Chongqing - According to news here, Chinese authorities may consider adjusting exchange rates to facilitate the transfer of the exchange market from Hong Kong and Shanghai to the mainland. It is expected that once the adjustment plan is completed, the premium on the Shanghai exchange rate will be reduced. (12th dispatch from Reuters)

### Dark Age in the Midst of Strenuous Fighting - China Has Apparently Survived / Those Who Underestimate China Will Eventually Regret It

London - Mr. Woodhead, the General Manager of the 福 [Fu] Company, recently stated that the Chinese government has appointed the company as its agent to purchase goods in the Sterling Area (excluding the United Kingdom) with a British loan of £5 million to China. With the reopening of the Burma Road, and loans from Britain and the United States, China has apparently survived the darkest period of its courageous struggle. Those who underestimate China will one day regret it. However, the establishment of bases by Vietnam along the Yunnan provincial border allows Japan to use army bombers in addition to naval bombers to disrupt the Burma Road and Chongqing. The Fu Company's business in Sichuan Province is difficult to operate due to prices being ten times higher than usual, but the situation now seems stable, and prices have gradually stabilized. The Fu Company's plan to participate in the development of coal and iron in Yunnan Province has been abandoned due to the suspension of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. (11th dispatch from Reuters)

### China Industrial Trust Company - Preparations Completed

Chongqing - The China Industrial Trust Company, funded and established by Du Yuesheng, has completed its preparations. It has been decided to set up two enterprises and four departments: banking, trust, and trade. Du will serve as chairman and general manager. (11th dispatch from Havas)

### Gasoline in Tianjin - Supply Restricted

Tianjin - The French-language Beijing Daily recently reported that the Asiatic Petroleum Company announced that gasoline supply to private cars at gas stations will be limited to a maximum of ten gallons per month. It is also heard that this restriction will also be implemented in Peiping. (11th dispatch from Havas)

### Liu Shishun to be Appointed - Minister to Canada

Chongqing - Reuters has received information from responsible sources that Liu Shishun, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is likely to be appointed as Minister to Canada. An official announcement will be made after the Canadian government's approval is obtained. (13th dispatch from Reuters)

know. From now on, if German or Italian warships enter the oceans necessary for the protection of American defenses, they are simply inviting danger. The order I, as Commander-in-Chief, am issuing to the United States Army and Navy is to immediately implement this policy. The entire responsibility rests with Germany. Unless Germany seeks to be fired upon, there will be no firing. This is my clear duty in this critical situation. This is the clear right of our sovereign nation. This is the only step we can take to maintain our defensive barrier, for we have undertaken to maintain the defenses around the Western Hemisphere. I have not underestimated the importance of this step. I have not taken it lightly. This is the result of months of constant thought, anxiety, and prayer. It is unavoidable in protecting your nation and mine. The American people will face this serious crisis in their history with American perseverance and American determination, just as they always have. They all know the reality of the attacks we have suffered. They all know the necessity of bravely defending against these attacks. Free people, aware of their responsibilities and the righteousness of their actions, will, with their inherent strength, and with the aid and guidance of Providence, maintain their stand against this latest attack on their democracy, sovereignty, and freedom. (End)

### Scope of the Defense Area Clearly Includes the Pacific

United Press, Washington, 12th. Axis pirate ships, if they do not quickly withdraw from the American defense territorial waters, it seems inevitable that they will encounter hostile actions with the American patrol forces. The meaning of the President's shooting order is that within the defense territorial waters, the American military force will not only protect ships of the United States, but also merchant ships flying any flag. The defense area extends at least to Iceland, which comprises two-thirds of the entire length of the lifeline from ports in the United States and Canada to the British Empire. The exact area of the American defense territorial waters has not been clarified, but the most eventful area is obviously the Atlantic Ocean, while the vast Pacific Ocean, far beyond Hawaii and north to the Siberian coast, is also included. However, President Roosevelt did not mention Japan in his speech. In addition to declaring shoot-on-sight, he insisted on general maritime freedom for commerce, but it seems unlikely that he would maintain this universal global right with gunfire. Willkie said, "No one can say whether the United States will be drawn into war as a result of this, but anyone with a thoughtful mind knows that if the President is not firm, it will inevitably lead to an unfortunate war. Now all Americans should support the President." Landon also said in his speech in Topekaw, "I have not had any illusions for months; if you are looking for trouble, you can always find it." Senator Connally, a Democrat from Texas, said, "I hope our destroyers will fire forcefully and directly." Senate Majority Leader Barkley said, "President Roosevelt had no other path to follow." Senator Nye, a prominent isolationist leader and a Republican from North Dakota, declared, "The President's speech has brought us closer to a shooting war because of his declaration." Some who have often criticized the government's policies said that the President's speech is a further attempt to abolish the Neutrality Act. If the public has a good response to the shoot-on-sight order, the President will soon demand the abolition of the Neutrality Act.

### New York Market: Optimistic Outlook

United Press, New York, 11th.

Japanese bonds have greatly improved. The financial community believes that America's tough attitude toward Germany has made a deep impression on Japan and may lead to a resolution of the Far Eastern problem.

### German Forces Approaching Western Suburbs, Situation in Leningrad Critical; German Commander Orders City to be Taken and Money Paid Within Two Days; Another Route Attacks Murmansk; Red Army Counterattacks in the Central and Southern Regions Continue to Make Progress

International News Agency, London, 12th. The "Exchange Telegraph," which is known for its well-informed sources, reported today from Sweden that Soviet troops have entered the western suburbs of Leningrad and street fighting is underway.

Reuters, London, 12th. Although reports here say that the German army is still twenty miles away from Leningrad, it is heard that German Commander General Leeb has ordered the city to be taken within two days. Moscow sources still believe that Leningrad has been completely surrounded, saying that railway traffic to the east is still open. It is reported that the fighting around the city is extremely fierce.

Havas, somewhere on the Soviet border, 11th. The German-Soviet War has lasted eighty-two days. The overall situation on the front line is still most tense in the northern route. After the Finnish army linked up with the German army south of Lake Ladoga, Leningrad was surrounded on all sides and transportation was blocked. The German army is now fiercely bombing the city with aircraft and artillery. The Red Army is also stepping up the city's defenses, vowing to hold it to the death. Both sides are evenly matched and at a stalemate. As for the central and southern routes, the Red Army has launched fierce counterattacks against the German army in recent days and has been quite successful. The German army is on guard and dare not relax slightly. In the southern route, although the port of Odessa is under bombardment by the Finnish and Romanian air forces, it is still able to receive reinforcements from the sea. The terrain of the port is more dangerous than that of Leningrad. Although it is besieged on three sides, it can still be defended.

Reuters, London, 12th. There is a new development in the Soviet-German war today. According to responsible sources, there are now signs that the German army has begun to attack the Murmansk region in the Arctic Ocean (600 miles north of Leningrad). However, how this attack will progress and its scale are still unknown. It is heard that the German army is invading Murmansk from the west, and the Finnish army is expected to participate as well. Murmansk has a railway line that runs south to Leningrad. Part of this line runs along the west bank of Lake Ladoga. The Finnish side has recently threatened to advance on the east bank of the lake. Further reports are still awaited. However, this new development does not seem to affect the fighting in the main center. The Soviet bulletin at midnight on Thursday did not detail the latest developments. There seem to be no major changes in the Leningrad region. The war situation of the Soviet army's counterattack along the long front line of 200 miles between Smolensk and Gomel is slightly unclear. It is reported that the German army has launched a counterattack southeast of Gomel, but this has not been confirmed by the Soviet side. If it is true, there will be important developments in the next two or three days. Soviet sources report that the Soviet army has continued to make progress and victories at various points in the central region. In one place, the Soviet army under General Yelemenko repelled the German army by twelve miles and recaptured ten villages on Wednesday. The German army suffered this terrible loss, which shows the ferocity of the Soviet army's attack. The German side reported that fierce fighting north of Kyiv was underway on Wednesday. However, Moscow sources said that the Soviet army's invasion there had been contained, and two German infantry divisions had also been heavily damaged. Regarding the war situation in Ukraine, London has not received reliable information. The German army in the area still seems to be trying to cross the Dnieper River. A Soviet supplementary statement said that the Soviet army's resistance to the invading Romanian army in Odessa was quite successful. Therefore, on the whole, there have been no major developments on the Soviet-German front in the past 24 hours except for Murmansk. The Soviet army in Leningrad is resolutely defending as before. It is noteworthy that German propaganda claims that the German people do not expect the city to fall quickly. German radio recently broadcast, "Whether Leningrad falls sooner or later makes no difference to the general strategic situation."

### Japanese Emperor Takes Personal Command of Military to Avoid Expanding Warfare; Willing to Loosen Ties with Axis to Foster Close Cooperation Between Army Ministry and Cabinet

United Press, Tokyo, 12th. The Japanese Emperor directly managed the army's authority yesterday, it is widely believed that this action is intended to enable the Army Ministry and the Konoe Cabinet to cooperate closely, so that Japan can avoid the scourge of war, even if it loosens ties with the Axis as a result. The general major developments are as follows: (1) A new headquarters was established, headed by General Yamada, the Inspector General of Military Academies. Japan was divided into four army regions, making General Yamada answerable only to the Emperor. People recall that General Yamada had previously served as the principal of the Army University, and had contributed greatly to the "re-education" of radical young officers since the May 15 Incident in 1932. Therefore, this new organization will ensure the closest cooperation between the army and the cabinet. (2) Konoe appointed Goto as the chairman of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. (3) The Emperor invited the cabinet to a luncheon "to express his appreciation for the cabinet's contributions." This action is a great honor for the cabinet and is sufficient to indicate the Emperor's approval of the cabinet's efforts to keep Japan out of war. (4) Newspapers continue to stop attacking the United States, and the China & Foreign Commercial News, which usually reflects the current cabinet's policies, even said that new efforts should be made to adjust US-Japan relations. (5) The General Mobilization Committee approved four orders regarding adjusting labor, conscripting people into the army, supervising workers in key factories, and matters concerning the National Labor Service Corps. At this point, labor has been placed in a virtual state of war. In addition, the Committee approved the confiscation of Japan Electric Power Company, power companies, and many other cases.

Reuters, Tokyo, 12th. Lieutenant General Kawabe Torashiro, the newly appointed chief of staff of the National Defense General Headquarters, gave a speech to reporters at the Army Ministry today, stating that the department will be fully responsible for completing air defense and will fully cooperate with other relevant authorities. He hopes that the people will trust the army's defensive strength and do their best for the completion of the supreme organization of national defense, so that they can smoothly cope with the various difficult situations. The people of the whole country should calmly observe developments, not lightly believe in unfounded rumors, and trust the government and the military.

Reuters, New York, 12th. According to news from the New York shipping industry, a German pirate ship is operating in the Pacific Ocean about 1,000 miles west of the Panama Canal. It has sunk the Dutch motor ship "Cota Nopan" (7,322 tons) and threatened other ships. It is heard that the Dutch motor ship was carrying rubber, tin, and palm oil to the United States. The survival of the crew and passengers is unknown.

International News Agency, Washington, 12th. The Icelandic Consulate here announced that on June 29, an Icelandic ship, the "Hekla," was sunk by a torpedo on its way to the United States, killing fourteen people. This matter had been rumored before, but has only been announced now.

Reuters, Singapore, 12th. British naval personnel here refused to comment on the reported activities of an enemy pirate ship in the Pacific and the sinking of Allied ships, and solemnly stated that the British Navy's success is largely due to its policy of strictly adhering to secrecy before all actions are completed.

### Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Suddenly Turns Upward After President Luo's Speech; Actual Sales and Short Covering Occur Simultaneously

After hovering for two days, the yarn market turned upward yesterday. This was because short sellers, seeing reports that Chairman Jiang had told American reporters that China would not change its national policy, had their confidence shaken. The people who had sold short were greatly affected and had a tendency to cover their positions. At the same time, transactions by the Guangdong merchants became more active, unlike the sluggishness of the previous day. As for the Nanyang region, negotiations are still ongoing. Some said that 500 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn were traded last night at a price of 1,740 yuan. Therefore, selling pressure decreased, and the market tightened, causing prices to rise. After President Roosevelt's speech was announced, discussions in the business community suggested that the yarn market could not be viewed pessimistically. However, a large number of short positions had not yet been covered and were still struggling, so the market remained calm, and the upward momentum was still slow. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,762 yuan, and the low price was 1,743 yuan. The market opened enthusiastically in the afternoon because people's confidence stabilized after President Luo's speech. The price was 1,764 yuan, rising to 1,768 yuan. The closing price was 1,762 yuan.

The opening of Double Horse yarn was relatively flat, with the opening price at 1,743 yuan. However, due to positive news, buyers flocked in, and the market became tighter, soon rising to 1,762 yuan. At the same time, exchange prices also jumped, and people's confidence increased. However, some profit-takers sold off, causing the price to fall back to 1,752 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the Hong Kong merchants' spot yarn trading was more active, and the exchange price closed higher again. Short covering drove the price up again to 1,762 yuan. According to the statistics, 9,500 bales were traded in half a day. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed below:

Hong Kong Merchants 150, Other Merchants 9,500

Total 9,650

The Jin Double Horse futures market suddenly became prosperous, suddenly becoming prosperous. The price of American cotton rose first, followed by the factory orders, and most people were excited, especially the retail investors covering their short positions. The buying sentiment permeated the market, leading to a situation of easy rise and little fall. The opening trend in the morning was quite strong. The large dormant players added to and initiated purchases to boost prices in the near term. Therefore, the market was dominated by buyers. The September contract opened at 1,655 yuan, the October contract at 1,666 yuan, and the November contract at 1,682 yuan. The opening price once tended to rise, but the widely publicized speech of President Luo in the middle made people lack a foundation, and the exchange once made a small return, so the period yarn also softened, but then it returned again. The afternoon closed up about 5.5 yuan to more than 10 yuan. In the afternoon, the buying sentiment was very strong because the factory orders were firm, and the market price rose section by section. The September contract once rose to 1,668 yuan, the October contract rose to 1,680 yuan, and the November contract also rose to 1,692 yuan, which seemed very stable. Russia's retail investors had some profit-taking, and there was a slight decline. As a result, the September contract was 1,664 yuan, closing up 14.5 yuan, the October contract was 1,676 yuan, up 17.5 yuan, and the November contract was 1,690 yuan, up 15.5 yuan. Judging from the trend, it is likely that there is a major reason for the recent pull-up by large players. Therefore, the yarn foot market may be stable and strong for a while if there is no negative international stimulation. However, it is also necessary to beware of the high-level exits of the multi-party. The transaction price list is listed on the left.

### Jiangbei Cotton Shipments to Shanghai Blocked: Indian Cotton Becomes Popular Purchase

Spot cotton trading is not smooth. However, after President Roosevelt's speech was published, people's hearts were quiet, and the yarn price has turned up. The situation has become more expensive. As for American cotton, it has progressed upward again, so the industry's thoughts are still leaning towards a good outlook. In addition, cotton from Jiangbei has been blocked from arriving in the future, so people's confidence has turned to foreign cotton, and they are vying to absorb Indian cotton.

Brazilian Cotton 200 bales, 780.0, Yufeng Factory

The New York cotton market first fell due to sales by the Southern merchants and profit-taking by bulls, but then rebounded due to purchases by New Orleans and Wall Street. At the same time, the purchase intentions were excited because of the threat of storms along the coast and in the Midwest. As a result, the closing prices were about 26 to 23 pounds higher than the previous day, depending on the terms.

The Indian cotton market first rose due to good cotton seed trading, but then fell due to sales by cotton merchants and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, yesterday's closing prices fell by about 2 to 6 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market will rise by 3.25 rupees.

The Shanghai foreign cotton market is quiet and firm. Although all parties are enthusiastic about purchasing due to the firm footing of American cotton and the high price of spot cotton in this city, actual transactions are few because ships are still difficult to obtain and foreign exchange settlement has not been smooth. Yesterday, in addition to the slightly embellished spot cotton situation, there were only three or four small batches of Brazilian cotton orders.

### Securities: Funds Injected, Bonds and Stocks

The informal bond market fell once in the morning yesterday, but in the afternoon the buying appetite was strong. Class C bonds rose to as high as two yuan, and the smallest trade was 1.3 yuan. Not only was the one-yuan market unable to be broken, it even returned to as high as one yuan. Although the rebound was not large, it was enough to show the strength of the multi-party. The future is still a situation of easy rise and difficult fall. In the morning yesterday, No. 25 Shengda bought about 300,000 yuan, and Xinfu also came to buy. Sheng Chang Dingkang also absorbed weakly. But the sellers were too crowded, and Hongda Lianhe Yuxing Dazhong Renchang Jiucheng were all selling, so Class C bonds were seen at 1.3 yuan. After entering, they rebounded slightly, similar to the previous day. In the afternoon, Xinfenghao raised the price to buy, and Runde Xinfu Defu Renfeng Xie Kang all had needs. The selling atmosphere on the table decreased, and although Yitai Tongxing Hongda Xinchang Renchang sold, Class C was seen at a high price of two yuan. The market was very firm, and it was difficult to see the size of the market. As a result, except for Class D, which was still down 2 cents, the rest recovered by 9 points to 2.5 cents. 2.34 million yuan were traded. The concise table is listed below.

Stock trading: 100 shares of Wing On Company were traded at a price of 16.5 yuan.

Also, the stock market of the Public Works Bureau continued to rise strongly. Although many sellers came out, the buying momentum was very strong.

The closing potential was extremely strong.

However, some exceed the face value, and some are also between 60% and 70% of the face value. As for the various stocks in operation, eight or nine out of ten exceed the face value. After the freeze, general funds have turned to securities. The soaring prices of Chinese and foreign stocks, who knows if they are not the work of funds?

### Food: Rice Market Fluctuations Eventually Return to Stability

Foreign Rice: After another depreciation in Korea, yesterday, due to the excess of the fall, it caused actual sales to take advantage of the cheapness to add to the reserves, and the ball was active, and it suddenly became tight. At the beginning of the morning market, the general sellers were waiting to see the opportunity and were unwilling to easily release their goods, and many shops in this street were quite interested. At the same time, the shorts started to cover their positions, and there were also new hoarders absorbing, and the ball trading started to surge, and the movement was abnormal. Therefore, the sellers took the opportunity to hold up, and the shouts were raised sharply. The prices all the way up. No. 1 West Real High Goods opened to 123 yuan, Bank Station Small Twisted opened to 109 yuan, and Outer Station opened to 108 yuan. Later, because the price was high and the sales were sluggish, it was flattened again. The color of the turnover is now swirling, and after that, the floating households who have made a profit are all coming out again, and the market is turning strong, and it is back to being tired. The rise and fall are repeated, and by the time of the closing, it is tight again. Therefore, the result of the closing market is an increase of 1 or 2 yuan compared with the previous market. A total of 14,000 bags of rice were traded throughout the day, and the British Huasi was 8900 tons. Although rumors have recently seen bearishness, large households are still insisting, but before the situation of peace or war between Japan and the United States is decided, the market price will not be excessively improved. The total rice stored in each station this week is 1,199,754 bags, which is a decrease of more than 44,000 bags compared with last week.

The glutinous japonica rice, early indica rice, and broken glutinous rice and new glutinous rice are all transferred according to the amount of their sources and whether the sales market is smooth or not. Therefore, the result is that early indica rice in South Port is depreciated by 12 yuan due to the abundance of goods, opening at 148 yuan to 145.5 yuan, while Wuxi broken glutinous rice is not glorified because the supply and demand are similar, and the special glutinous rice is still 152 yuan. The Kunshan high glutinous rice is 150 yuan, and the new glutinous rice is rare and insufficient for distribution, and it is exceptionally firm and beautiful, and it is unique to raise 12 yuan, opening at 153 yuan to 151.5 yuan. Although the route of glutinous rice is not wide, there are still some scattered appetites, but the source has been cut off for a long time, and the market goods have been rare. The cargo owner has no intention of releasing the goods easily, so under the sale, the market is standing guard, and there is no change. Hong Kong's special yuan is 127 yuan, ordinary high since 125.5 yuan, and second to 111 yuan, and glutinous green is 1112 yuan.

Foreign rice is also coming to Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Yuansheng Wheel carries 10,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and is docked at Roosevelt Wharf to unload. The foreign rice is the Municipal Council's fair-priced rice (Zu).

### Scattered Route of Flour

Yesterday, the sales of foreign powder were still lively. Although there was no big movement in the moon cake news, the scattered routes were not lonely. In addition to the continued handling by each household on this street, the customers in the inland area also responded slightly. Kanfen Golden Dragon Spleen and American Fen Paotai Brand are recognized as the standard sales in the market due to their good quality and sufficient inventory. Even the general miscellaneous brands have some decimals. A total of 23,000 bags of various powders were traded throughout the day, and the actual sales accounted for the majority. The hoarders did not dare to enter and were reluctant to exit due to the undecided situation of peace or war between Japan and the United States. Both parties then became an abandoned game, and the market was less active. The market began to tend to be flat, but the floating households' ball trading could not be avoided, so the market still fluctuated. The West Warehouse of Jinlong opened in the morning market at 30 yuan, 0.9 yuan, then to 31 yuan, 0.5 points, and then returned to flatness. In the afternoon, it was 30 yuan, 0.89 yuan.

Rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil once soared 67 yuan, and then the profit-takers sold off a little, and the result was that it was still 34 yuan higher than before. The total market opened for the next transaction of 6,000 dunnage of Qing Oil from the Dayou Factory in September, and the opening price was 171 yuan. The highest was 173 yuan, the lowest was 160 yuan, 5 cents, and the closing was 170 yuan, 0.5 yuan. There were also 500 barrels of raw rapeseed oil, priced at 171 yuan to 170 yuan.

### Power Company Again Requests Surcharge on Coal per "Jin" [Unit of Weight]: Public Utilities Committee Held Meeting Yesterday, What Decisions Were Made Is of Great Concern to All

The Public Utilities Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM in the Council's conference room to discuss two proposals: (1) a proposal by Baolong Hospital requesting a special discount on electricity used by the hospital from the Shanghai Water & Electricity Company; (2) a proposal by the Shanghai Power Company requesting approval to levy a surcharge on coal per "jin." Regarding the first proposal, Baolong Hospital based its request on the grounds that the hospital is a public service and should therefore have its electricity fees reduced. However, each point made by the hospital could be cited as precedent by all hospitals in the city, so the outcome is of significant interest. As for the second proposal, in addition to the 30% restriction already implemented for large electricity consumers, the company intends to levy a surcharge on coal per "jin" for industrial electricity consumption. The company had previously levied a surcharge on coal per "jin" in 1932 due to a shortage of coal in Shanghai, charging one "cheng" [10%] surcharge per kilowatt-hour, except for industrial electricity consumers. Therefore, whether or not a surcharge on coal per "jin" will be levied this time must be decided after discussion. However, the results of yesterday's meeting are not yet known.

### Exchange Rate Measures Revised: Guarantee System Abolished, Those Previously Applying for Foreign Exchange Must Re-submit Applications; Chongqing Economic Circles Encourage Capital Movement Inward

Havas World News Agency Chongqing, 12th: Economic figures here say that the Stabilization Fund stipulates that those in Shanghai engaged in international trade must sell foreign exchange earned from exports to 14 banks, otherwise they will be refused the foreign exchange needed for imports. This measure is an effective measure to eliminate the remaining black market. After the black market for foreign exchange is eliminated, the inward movement of legal tender can be stimulated by means of premiums. At the same time, the inward movement of goods should be encouraged. The government, it is said, will provide transportation conveniences and insurance coverage for those who move goods. The government can also compensate for losses from premiums. In addition, the Ministry of Finance announced that those with legitimate uses can apply to use foreign currency. Those with deposits frozen in foreign banks who want to transfer them to the Central Bank are bound to increase.

Goods Provided with Foreign Exchange Can Stabilize Prices

Mr. Hawkins, General Manager of Mercantile Bank, told reporters yesterday that the trial measures for September promulgated by the Stabilization Fund were passed by the plenary meeting of the Stabilization Fund. The chairman of the meeting was Mr. Chen Guangfu, the Chinese chairman; Mr. McKay, supervisor of Citibank, and himself were present. The American commissioner, Mr. Fox, was represented by his assistant, Mr. Taylor. After Mr. Tweedy returned to Hong Kong from Manila, he held another meeting with all the commissioners last week. After careful overall study, the final decision was made on the proposed measures. After the Hong Kong meeting concluded, they returned to Shanghai. Since the Stabilization Fund announced the new measures regarding the supply of foreign exchange in Shanghai, stipulating that certain specially approved imported goods can settle foreign exchange at the rate set by the Stabilization Fund of 5.3125 yuan per U.S. dollar, the market price of major imported goods, although there is no downward trend, according to an employee of an American oil company, at least before the consultation between the oil companies and representatives of the Stabilization Fund is over, there will be no change. An importer of pharmaceuticals also said that the price of imported pharmaceuticals will not change. If the measures set by the Stabilization Fund are fully implemented, it can curb the rise in drug prices.

Previously Settled Foreign Exchange Must Re-submit Applications

The Central Bank has received orders from the Stabilization Fund to promulgate revised measures for requesting the supply of foreign exchange for the import of essential goods, and has notified 14 Allied banks and the China, Communications, and Farmers Banks to implement them together. It has also issued the revised application form format to the relevant banks for printing and distribution to the various importing firms with whom they do business, retroactively supplying foreign exchange at the prices set by the Stabilization Fund beginning on September 3. As for those who requested foreign exchange from the designated banks using written or old-style applications before September 3, they must re-fill the revised application forms and complete the various procedures. At the moment, the designated Chinese and foreign banks have sent letters along with single application forms to their respective customers. The revised application form is named "Application to the Stabilization Fund for Foreign Exchange Required." There are two types: white and red. White is used for applying for foreign exchange for goods listed on Lists A and B. Red is used for small-scale trade with a monthly amount not exceeding US$2,000 or £500. Both are in quintuplicate. The first, second, third, and fourth copies are submitted to the Stabilization Fund. The fifth copy is kept by the bank. Each copy must be signed or stamped by the handling bank and the importing firm. Importers who wish to apply for foreign exchange can obtain this type of application form from any designated bank, fill in the relevant items, and submit it to the original handling bank for submission to the Stabilization Fund for approval. The approval period, approval method, and amount, etc., are entirely determined by the Stabilization Fund. The nature of the application form is only similar to an investigation form.

Method of Approving Foreign Exchange Settlement Changed

The tenth item of the application form originally contained a guarantee provision: "If the Stabilization Fund finds that the imported goods described herein do not match those described in the application, our bank is willing to sell all the foreign exchange obtained from the Stabilization Fund for the supply of imported goods back to the Stabilization Fund at the exchange rate at the time of purchase…" However, the revised application form deletes this paragraph. The reason is that, according to the old law, applications could be submitted by telegram before the application form was delivered to the Stabilization Fund, and then the application form would be supplemented later. Therefore, if the Stabilization Fund found discrepancies in the application, it could order the original handling bank to recover the approved foreign exchange. But now, according to the revised measures, the Stabilization Fund will approve foreign exchange settlement only after receiving the application form, deciding whether to approve or disapprove based on the actual situation, or settling all or part. Therefore, the guarantee of "selling back" in the original method can be cancelled.

### French Flagship Moored in Shanghai Ordered to Sail Away

The French flagship "Grange" moored in Shanghai was recently ordered to leave Shanghai from the pontoon on the Bund in the French Concession and sail to Vietnam. The flagship of the French Far East Fleet, "La Motte-Picquet" (7,249 tons), has been moored off Saigon since leaving Shanghai. According to Japanese sources, the ship will be moved to Osaka Dockyard for repairs soon.

### Following Curbing of Rice Prices, Curbing of Coal Briquette Prices: Municipal Council Cooperates with French Municipal Council; Coal Briquette Factories Still Active After Bombing

The "Shanghai Times" reported that the municipal authorities of the International Settlement and the French Concession are organizing a committee to control the price of coal briquettes. If successful, millions of citizens will benefit greatly. It is not yet known who will serve as members of the committee. A spokesman for the Municipal Council only said, "We are cooperating with the French Municipal Council to establish this committee."

No Authority for Trade Associations

The price of coal briquettes is now twenty times higher than before the war. The Coal Industry Association attempted to lower the price, but ten major coal briquette manufacturers, all members of the association, recently withdrew from the association and set their own high prices. The association therefore has no authority to implement its price limit decision. In recent months, the price of coal briquettes has risen higher and higher, reaching an unprecedented high of 17.2 yuan per "dan" [unit of weight]. After the municipal authorities of the two concessions achieved excellent results by purchasing foreign rice on their own to deal with the food problem for citizens, they have now decided to establish a new committee to study the problem of coal briquettes, an essential fuel for citizens, and find a way to solve it.

Suppression Measures

According to coal briquette manufacturers, 17.2 yuan per "dan" is a fair selling price that only obtains legitimate profit. The high price is due to the increased cost of importing coal dust from Vietnam and India. Observers believe that the municipal authorities must handle the import of coal dust themselves and resolutely implement other stringent measures in order to suppress the price of coal briquettes. What actions the municipal authorities will take will naturally depend on the recommendations of the new committee. The seriousness of the coal briquette problem can be seen in the recent bombing of two coal briquette factories, which injured three people. The bombers aimed to reduce the price of coal briquettes. The newly established committee also has this as its goal, but will proceed in a more effective and legal way.

### Unified Check Clearing: Implemented the Day After Tomorrow, Scheduled Clearing Suspended

The Shanghai Banks Joint Reserve Committee, referring to the regular clearing system of the London Check Clearing House, has decided to change all cleared checks to be settled by collection method, and has established a unified check clearing system. It is scheduled to be implemented starting September 15 (Monday). The original scheduled clearing will be suspended. After this, the clearing banks will be spared the trouble of dispatching staff to the clearing house every day, the procedures will be unified, and the work can be simplified. The detailed measures have already been seen in this newspaper's economic news column.

### Principal and Interest on Gold Long-Term Bonds Can Be Collected on Behalf in Shanghai

The 16th repayment of principal on the long-term gold finance bonds of the Republic of China has been drawn by the National Debt Fund Management Committee on [Date in month unclear]. All drawn bonds and matured interest can be paid starting September 30. A reporter from the "New Voice News" learned yesterday from the Central Bank that the principal to be repaid for this gold long-term issue is 1,125,000 yuan, and the matured interest is 351,561.25 yuan. Although the collateral for these bonds is the customs surplus, in order to maintain credit, funds have been allocated and deposited with the bank, and will be paid in full starting at the end of September. However, payments will be made at the Chongqing head offices of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank. However, the Shanghai branch offices of these three banks can collect on behalf.

### Astonishing Consumption of Cosmetics

According to information from the Jianghai Customs, from January to July of this year, imports of perfumes and cosmetics were valued at 539,174 Haikwan taels of gold, equivalent to 1,459,544 yuan in national currency. From January to July of last year, the figure was only 329,035 Haikwan taels of gold, equivalent to 890,699 yuan in national currency. Therefore, this year's imports exceeded the same period last year by as much as 550,000 yuan in national currency. At a time when the nation is struggling, such unnecessary consumption of cosmetics has intensified, and we must be vigilant.

### Rice Inventory

In order to make the outside world aware of the amount of rice stored, the Shanghai Rice Industry Association sends personnel every week to Pudong, Hongkou, the central district and other places to conduct on-site surveys of rice inventory. According to the association's survey of 128 rice stockpiles (from last Thursday to this Friday), a total of more than 80 Chinese and foreign stockpiles held 1,199,754 bags of rice, a slight decrease from the previous period. The reason is that the number of ships coming to Shanghai from overseas last week was not as high as the previous week. A large amount of foreign rice that has already been traded is waiting to be loaded onto ships in the production areas. The Rice Industry Association has submitted the survey results to the authorities of the two concessions for review and to seven rice industry groups for price preparation.

### Foreign Vessels Sailing Shanghai-Zhejiang-Fujian Line: Clearance Not Approved, Da Shun Kang Vessel Detained at Wusongkou, Harrison President Ship May Arrive Today

Foreign merchant ships that previously sailed along the ports of the Zhejiang-Fujian coast, in view of the recovery of Fuzhou, and in order to dredge the source of funds, are preparing to resume Shanghai-Fujian shipping, and have requested the consular authorities and the Jianghai Customs to allow the resumption of sailing. It is reported that most of these ships belong to British merchants, and there are also American merchants. The British and American Consulates in Shanghai have no problem with the resumption of sailing of the ships, but the Jianghai Customs has consistently refused to allow the ships to clear customs for export. The shipping companies have requested the consular authorities to contact the Jianghai Customs.

Da Shun Kang Vessel: Export Detained

According to news from the shipping industry, a foreign firm here, in order to facilitate passengers traveling from Shanghai to the interior, chartered the Da Shun Kang vessel of Jardine Matheson from a French shipping company, intending to sail directly from Shanghai to Guangzhou Bay. This would allow passengers to avoid having to go through Hong Kong, avoiding the trouble of preparing entry permits, etc. Therefore, at that time, the ship was very crowded. On the 3rd of this month, after being approved by the Jianghai Customs for clearance, it hoisted the French flag and left Shanghai, intending to sail directly to Guangzhou Bay that day. Unexpectedly, when it sailed to Wusongkou, it was suddenly detained by the Japanese Navy, preventing it from exporting. As of yesterday, nine days had passed, and it had not been released. It is reported that the Japanese Navy's reason for detaining the ship is that it was not registered and that the exported goods must be inspected. Therefore, the passengers on the ship are trapped on board, which is extremely painful.

Harrison Ship: May Arrive Today

The American President Lines is scheduled to send two President ships to Shanghai this month. In addition to the Pacific Bunker Hill, which left port the day before yesterday, another ship is the world-class Harrison President liner, which returned to the United States on the 15th of last month via the Cape of Good Hope. According to a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, the ship will arrive in port this morning and will be in Shanghai for about one or two days, still following the original world-class route and returning to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope. According to the company's scheduled President ship schedule, the next President ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in early October.

According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, who inquired in the shipping industry, the American President Lines vessels requisitioned by the US Maritime Commission on June 16 of this year included Coolidge, Cleveland, Pierce, Taft, Hayes, Jackson, and Adam, a total of seven ships. Currently, the Cleveland and Coolidge ships have already resumed flights to Shanghai one after another. It is now learned that the President Pierce ship has also been scheduled to resume flights and arrive here on the 30th of this month. However, it is learned that the ship will not be used exclusively for evacuating overseas Chinese and has all levels of cabin class available for passengers to take.

### Japanese Rubber Factory: Steam Boiler Explosion, Three Workers Injured

At the Minwah Rubber Factory, No. 124 Qiqihar Road, Yangshupu, a steam boiler suddenly exploded yesterday afternoon, injuring workers. Yesterday afternoon at 11:45 AM, the steam boiler in the factory's machine room suddenly exploded due to excessive heat. At that time, there was a loud bang, and the iron sheets flew in all directions, and boiling water splashed everywhere. Most of the laborers did not know what was happening and fled, causing great chaos. As a result, three laborers in the machine room were hit and scalded by iron sheets and boiling water: Tang Changgen (19 years old) injured arm, feet, and head; Wu Xingtao (19 years old) injured head and face, etc.; Xu Caibao (23 years old) injured head and chest, etc. They were sent to Hudong Hospital for treatment after the accident.

Moreover, recent donation income is very small, which is not enough to support the charity. A team was dispatched to Nanyang Hong Kong to raise funds a month ago, and it is now preparing to raise funds in this city. All procedures are currently underway, and once everything is ready, a team will be sent out to solicit donations to maintain the charity.

### Memorial Article for Wang Dan Kui

— Dai Chunfeng

Mr. Wang Dan Kui of Chongming was elegant and valued moral philosophy, he embraced his sorrow in these times. Both in and out of office, he put what he had learned into practice. In his later years, he devoted himself to water conservancy, bringing fortune to the southeast. His reputation was well-deserved, a mirror for all to admire. He suddenly passed away a month ago, and those who knew him and those who did not were deeply saddened. A memorial service is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM new clock time on September 14th in the auditorium on the sixth floor of the Pudong Native Association. This newspaper previously published a biography of Mr. Wang Dan Kui written by Tang Weizhi. Now we have obtained a memorial article written by Dai Chunfeng, as follows:

On this fourteenth day of September in the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, Dai Chunfeng of Funing, with a bundle of fresh grass and a cup of clear tea, reverently offers this sacrifice to the spirit of Wang Dan Kui: Alas, the black dragon hides its brilliance, the white crane conceals its splendor, the energy is stifled in the azure clouds, Su Nei Han's life palace sits in Scorpio, the literary talent is buried in the yellow earth, Deng Gaomi's unlucky fate meets the snake. It is as if a sword hides its light and a jade its talisman. Is there anyone like Mr. Wang Dan Kui? When young, he was outstanding, not boasting of his knowledge of rats or the stele of chickens; when older, he was intelligent, compared to the tiger's head and the swallow's jaw. He excelled in scholarship and served as an official, taking up his duties in the government, quoting the classics, combining leniency and severity, resolving disputes and difficulties for the inhabitants. He used the classics to govern the country, and people were amazed at the young woman's yellow silk; he expressed concern for the people, and lamented the flaw in the precious vase. His writing was worthy of appreciation, his wisdom worthy of admiration. Was it not because he was both a scholar and a man of integrity and piety that he could achieve this? When the chaos of war directly attacked the imperial capital and the imperial family fled west, he avoided the chaos and relied on his mother's home, moving east with her in a sedan chair, comparable to the filial piety of Ying Kao Shu. Filial piety reached its extreme. Fortunately, Zheng Zhuang Gong could be influenced by sincerity, and his contributions were not insignificant. When the world turned around, the rain cleared, and the rainbow disappeared, he did not covet his position and abandoned his official status. In the long wind, he traveled ten thousand miles, visiting foreign lands, and returned from the ocean, further refining his judgement. Although his talent for economics was thwarted, he returned and established a department to do business, wholeheartedly serving the country. No ancient virtuous man could surpass him, and no contemporary celebrity could compare to him. Moreover, he welcomed talents with open arms, always ready to receive them. We had hoped that he would hold the plan firmly in his grasp and greatly develop it, but how could we have expected that he would leave so soon, before the seat had even warmed? It is a pity that such an unparalleled national talent only had an inexhaustible filial piety. Heaven does not bless those who are virtuous, and this is also Mr. Wang's unique quality. Later, his financial management eliminated corruption and brought clarity, his road construction was solid and used real materials, he promoted water conservancy to benefit the people, and gathered emergency relief to aid the common people. These were the greatest of Mr. Wang's contributions, and the most outstanding of his great achievements. Such virtue and achievements deserved a long life. Even entering the immortal land of the Tongbai Mountains or enjoying the eternal scenery of the mulberry tree in the evening was not an exaggeration. Alas, the fish had nowhere to rely because the trenches were filled in, and the returning swallow lost its home because the Wu Palace burned. This has caused later generations to have no chance to see him again, and the party-state and the homeland can only remember his model. Chunfeng is different in learning and cherishes the flood dragon, ashamed of the talent of the crow in the dream. Remembering his life, everything is vividly in front of my eyes. Recalling Mr. Wang's upright conduct and his words becoming a model, I cannot help but grieve and weep, and present these words with tears. Alas, may you enjoy this offering.

### Yu Qiaqing Road: Car Robbery

Afterwards, the driver reported the incident to the police station, requesting an investigation.

### Hong Kong Chinese Business Daily Publishes Declaration: Local Organizations Deny It

The Hong Kong Chinese Business Daily recently published a declaration in the name of various Shanghai public organizations. It is reported that various local organizations, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Education Association, the Student Union, and the Municipal Women's Association, have stated that they were never consulted beforehand. Therefore, the so-called "various public organizations" in the declaration are clearly fabricated by borrowing names. They have jointly sent a letter to the newspaper to request a solemn correction.

### Bloody Incident on Avenue Edward VII: She Jinbo Assassinated; Friend Wu Liuting Wounded in the Arm

Yesterday afternoon, a sudden assassination occurred at the entrance of Lane 275 on Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession. It was later learned that the victim was She Jinbo, and another person, Wu Liuting, was wounded. The gunman escaped without a trace. The details of the incident are described below:

Shot While Getting into a Car with a Friend

She Jinbo, a native of Shaoxing, was 60 years old and resided at No. 20, Lane 275, Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession. He lived a comfortable life and had his own car with license plate No. 8531. Yesterday afternoon at 3:50 PM, his friend Wu Liuting, also from Shaoxing, came to visit. After a brief conversation, they went out together. She's driver, Zhu Hongchang, had already parked the car at the entrance of the lane. As She and Wu stepped out of the lane and were about to get into the car, an assassin, who had been lying in wait at the entrance, was ready.

She Hit by Three Bullets, Wu Wounded in Right Arm

As the assassin saw She about to get into the car and the driver opening the door, he immediately pulled out a pistol and fired six or seven shots at She. She was caught off guard and was hit in the head and chest, collapsing in a pool of blood. At the same time, Wu Liuting, who was nearby, was also hit in the right arm by a bullet, causing blood to flow. The assassin, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, fled with his weapon and disappeared instantly. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to conduct a thorough search, but they found nothing. They then took the injured to the hospital. However, She's injuries were fatal, and he died before reaching the hospital. Wu's injuries were not serious.

Cause of Assassination Under Investigation

It is reported that She and Wu were colleagues. The reason for the assassination is currently under investigation by the police. In addition to taking the recovered shell casings back to the police station for examination, the police also summoned Zhu Hongchang, the driver who witnessed the incident, and She's family to the police station to inquire about the details. She's body was transferred to the coroner's office, and the court was requested to conduct an examination.

### China Industrial Company

The China Industrial Company is a newly established company aimed at supporting and revitalizing private industries. Its core function is the real estate department, which is honest and trustworthy in handling the sale and purchase of real estate and ensures the same. Therefore, it has already established a strong reputation within just a month of its founding. It also operates in domestic tea and goods, located at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Sichuan Road.

If you lost it, you can explain the date of issue, check number, and face value and contact the editorial department of this office after 5 PM to claim it.

Women's Wallet: Respectfully, yesterday (the 11th), I was riding the No. 24 trolleybus to Avenue Foch. A lady was about to get off when she suddenly lost her wallet. She said that it contained a school pass and keys. She searched everywhere but could not find it and got off at Rue Poussin in disappointment. Later, I saw an object under the door panel of the car and picked it up. It turned out to be a red beaded women's wallet. I handed it over to the ticket seller. When the car arrived at the Canidrome, I got off in a hurry and did not inquire about its number in detail. Therefore, I hereby borrow a corner of your publication to disclose it so that the owner can go to the tram company in the French Concession to claim it. Reader asks.

Life

### On the Sands of Time

— Xiao Yun

The magician's best trick is to "create something out of nothing" or "make something disappear without a trace." The audience knows it's fake, but because the magician's movements are so swift, they have to believe it's real. But regardless of whether it's real or fake, the things the magician transforms have already happened in front of the audience to entertain the guests.

If you are buried in worldly affairs, you may not think about the fleeting nature of life. But if you visit an obstetrics hospital and then take a stroll in a cemetery, you can understand how humans line up to come into the world and how they line up to leave the world. The traces of humanity are like the things in the magician's hands, seeming almost impossible to trace. But we are also like the things in the magician's hands, and although we are in the world for a short time, we must and will have an effect in the time and space we occupy. As for what kind of effect we want to have, that is up to each of us to work hard and decide.

The American poet Longfellow had a poem that can be translated as follows:

The deeds of great men tell us,

We too can make our lives sublime,

When we leave this world,

Leave footprints on the sands of time.

Perhaps in the great journey of life,

There is a lonely brother in distress,

Seeing these deep footprints,

Will once again muster the courage to live.

So let us rise up and work hard,

Fear no fate or hardship,

Constantly pursue, constantly create,

Learn how to labor, how to hope.

Education

### Family Education

— Shan Li

The importance of family education on a person is self-evident. But to be honest, in China, we are too casual about family education. In the best cases, parents cooperate and manage together, but often the father plays the stern role, and the mother plays the kind role, scaring on one hand and persuading on the other, hitting on one hand and begging on the other, the so-called strict father and kind mother. At worst, the father is busy doing business outside, and the mother is busy managing household affairs, so you don't care, and I don't bother, putting the responsibility of educating children entirely on the school, and not hearing or asking about it themselves. In the worst cases, the father is not a father, the mother is not a mother, the son is not a son, and the daughter is not a daughter. If they have money, they send their children to school, and if they don't have money, they just give up. If the children are happy, they study, and if they are not happy, they just do as they please. If the father is happy today, he buys a piece of candy for the children to eat, and if he is not happy, he picks them up and beats them. If the mother is happy today, she cooks a good dish for the children to eat, and if she is not happy, she will scold them all day long. Other evil and despicable things are also done by parents in front of their children.

The above three types are all bad family education, differing only in the degree of their severity. Under this kind of bad family education, it is of course very difficult to produce a virtuous and capable child. But once the children grow up and are unfilial, incompetent, and incapable, the parents complain and blame others, thinking that their ancestors lacked virtue, so they produced such unfilial descendants. In fact, if the children are good, the parents can be proud of themselves. If the children are not good, the parents cannot shirk their responsibility. And if parents want their children to be good or not, they should first see if their own education is good or not. As for school education, that is secondary.

Writing this, I remembered an incident related to family education, so I will record it as a conclusion:

"Lily wants to buy lilies!"

"Mom! Someone outside is selling lilies, let's buy some to make lily soup, okay?" A-Da, who was writing, suddenly said.

"Okay!" The mother had just finished speaking when her two sons hurriedly pulled her straight out of the door.

When buying lilies, the mother added a little, grabbed a little, weighed a little more, and argued for a long time with the vendor. And the two sons, of course, had their own work: as long as the lily seller's eyes wandered or her body turned, A-Da took two, and A-Er took one, and their hands and feet were quick, and they had already slipped into the house. After a while, the mother bought the lilies and came back, saw A-Da holding two lilies in his hand and A-Er holding one, and just slowly walked over and put the three lilies into the basket, as if nothing had happened.

Two hours later, the lily soup was cooked.

"Mom! Brother eats three bowls, I want to eat three bowls too," A-Er said dissatisfied.

"Brother eats one more bowl because he took one more lily than you."

The mother's reply made A-Da smile triumphantly.

"I will take more next time," A-Er said angrily.

Thought

### Philosopher

— Hou Fang

I once heard a story:

A philosopher was traveling on a boat once. On the boat, he gathered with people to chat.

"Sir, do you understand art?" the philosopher asked.

"No," the person replied.

"Then one-third of your life is gone. Also, may I ask, do you understand science?"

"I don't understand either."

"Then another third of your life is gone."

As he was saying this, suddenly everyone shouted that the ship was sinking. The person asked the philosopher calmly,

"Sir, can you swim?"

"No."

"Then your whole life is gone."

It is a sad thing when theory is separated from practice and knowledge is separated from reality. The sinking of the ship was unfortunate for the philosopher. He had not learned to swim. He did not have time to learn to swim. He is now going to drown. However, I don't know if that philosopher was unlucky. If he remained calm and prepared to grab a wooden plank to escape, then he would be a true philosopher.

In fact, the experiences of learned people are often so sad. They are too far removed from reality. They do not receive the sympathy of society and are persecuted by society. However, I hope they will always struggle. "There is no resentment in building a home in a place where one is bound to fall."

Military Equipment

### Torpedo Gun

— Ke Zhong

Many Americans no longer dare to indulge in the delusion of resting easy in this turbulent world. Although there are still some isolationist ostriches who want to deceive themselves and others with the strategy of burying their heads in the sand, most Americans are clear-headed. They know that they cannot "live in isolation" in this small world, so they not only do their best to help the democratic countries resisting aggression, but also make unremitting efforts in the defense of their east and west coasts. Among the recent inventions for coastal defense, there is a torpedo gun made of a steel frame that can be installed on ordinary small speedboats and can launch small torpedoes. It has been suggested that in the event of war in the future, all private yachts in the United States can be equipped with this new weapon to serve the country.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

12. Unexpected Disturbance

Principal Fang told him that Xiaogouzi had searched in the city for more than half a month but still couldn't find Mei Bao, so he had no choice but to go to see Liu Tuzi again. But he was very clever. He knew that even if the Public Security Bureau summoned him, they wouldn't be able to get any information out of him, so he decided not to stand firm with him anymore and just begged him softly. He didn't know what he said, but he moved Liu Tuzi, who was rough but not cunning, and he honestly said that he really had no part in this matter, but according to what he knew, the person had been tricked away by Shang Laoer and was now being taken to Beiping. Finally, he gave Xiaogouzi a not very detailed address, so Xiaogouzi had rushed to Beiping overnight. Principal Fang himself helped him with ten yuan for travel expenses. …

"Okay, Third Master, there's finally news about the girl!" Zhang Laoliu, Xiaogouzi's brother, heard about this and hurried to comfort Qiuhaitang again. "With my brother's stubbornness, he won't come back without finding her. You should just relax and take good care of yourself and wait for them to come back!"

Because of Xiaogouzi's loyalty, Qiuhaitang's heart suddenly became more optimistic.

"Your brother is really good. I hope he can bring Mei Bao back. From now on, I will always treat him like a brother!" He said with a rare smile on his face.

From then on, he was indeed a little more relieved and just counted the days, calculating Xiaogouzi's journey every day. (210)

Entertainment Circle

### From "The Swallow Letter" to Kunqu Teacher Zhen Fengming

— Shi Yiren

"The Swallow Letter" is a famous romance. Only four scenes remain in circulation today: 1. Writing a Portrait, 2. Picking Up the Letter, 3. Adultery and Escape (the dog hole performed by Wang Chuansong, seen in the Li Xiangjun film), and 4. Appealing to the Governor, all of which are male and female lead scenes. Only those who are elegant and sentimental can achieve the highest level. Recently, the Beijing-Chaopai school has also arranged to perform this drama. Wang Guiqiu once announced the repertoire when he came to Shanghai, but it was never actually performed. Only the Yue Opera has been performed several times, which has won the praise of the audience. The original book was written by Ruan Dacheng at the end of the Ming Dynasty. He asked Wang Duo to write lyrics on stationery and presented it to Emperor Hongguang, who was very pleased. He also ordered his family actors to perform it, and all the officials, scholars, and famous people in Nanjing praised it. Wang Yuyang's poem: "New songs and fine characters written on ice silk, the young emperor watched with a smile; for thousands of years, the Qinhuai River has sobbed, and should not still hate Duke Kong." The struggle between the Donglin Society and the Fushe gradually led to the collapse of the Ming Dynasty. Kong Shangren's "The Peach Blossom Fan" is a true record of the event.

Chen Fengming was a fan actor, skilled in plays such as "Qin Tiao," "Ting Hui," "Shu Zhuang," and "Gui Chi." He and Lu Shouqing, Shi Guilin, Shen Pansheng, and You Caiyun were all top actors of the Suzhou school. His pronunciation was extremely accurate, and his demeanor on stage, the gestures of his fingers, and the fluttering of his sleeves all followed a certain standard without any deviation. When performing "Picking Up the Letter," when Huo Duliang looked up and saw the Yan Qian returning with the wind, his eyes were slanted, and the scene was lifelike. After the age of fifty, he grew a beard and realized the truth, retiring from the stage. He accepted the invitation of the Shanghai Pingsheng Qushe and discussed with amateur actors. Now, Ge Qifu's "Ting Hui," Zhuang Yifu's "Drunken Concubine," and Shen Hengyi and Zhu Yaowen's "Seeing the Mother" all benefited from his guidance. After the age of sixty, he also taught students. Haining Shen Sanming obtained his true biography, played the flute very skillfully, and his rules and schools were the same as his teacher's. He was Fengming's proud disciple. In his later years, he stayed at home and was displaced and impoverished after the incident, and died in a haggard state.

### The Story of Yu Zhenfei Going to Sea (Part 2)

— Shao Xian (Sent from Beiping)

Again, Quan Chu thought that Yun Yuhua and the two would be able to compete with Yanqiu, but who would have thought that Yanqiu is still Yanqiu today, and neither Yun Yuhua nor both were able to cooperate with Cha Quan to the end (but the pianist Mu Tiefen, since leaving Yanqiu, has always played the piano for Yun). As for Quan, his reputation was ruined, to the point of being irreparable. (This person has many wonderful things, which will be described in another article.) Speaking of Yanqiu, after Wang Youquan defected, he invited Jiang Miaoxiang to cooperate. Miaoxiang is a capable person in this field, and cooperating with Yanqiu can be a happy and fulfilling experience. However, Miaoxiang is Meilanfang's supporting role, and he goes out to perform with Lanfang from time to time, and he was unable to cooperate with Yanqiu for a long time. Yanqiu, in view of this, decided to find other talents. In the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Yanqiu cordially invited Yu Zhenfei to the sea to cooperate. At that time, Zhenfei was playing at sea, and he had no intention of going to the sea. He asked all parties to urge him, and Yanqiu was very respectful to Zhenfei and was willing to treat him generously. Zhenfei finally moved him, only changing the method of the three chapters: (1) Every time Zhenfei performs a play, no matter how many plays are performed, he will be paid for eight plays a month. (2) Everything about Zhenfei must be better than others; (3) Zhenfei has the right to express his opinions at any time if he is dissatisfied. That year, the two parties cooperated under such an agreement, and Zhenfei officially went to sea at this time and performed on the same stage with Yanqiu in Ping. Yanqiu indeed treated Zhenfei with special attention, and Zhenfei also had a sense of knowing Yanqiu. Yanqiu learned a lot from Zhenfei's Kunqu opera skills, and at the same time, because Zhenfei was proficient in writing, Zhenfei also took charge of propaganda and writing when Yanqiu went out to perform. Therefore, the feelings between the two parties are very strong, but who would have thought that the good times would not last long, and they would eventually break up. What caused the breakup? Please read the following article to find out.

### Brief News

Liangxi painter Chen Fucang devoted himself to the six methods of painting. Before the war, he lived in seclusion in Huilu and Jichang Garden. During the incident, the garden was completely destroyed, so he came to Shanghai. He has served as a professor at art schools. The landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, and animals he has created all follow the methods of the ancients and come from his own mind. Now, with the encouragement of friends, he has asked him to present his recent works to the public. An exhibition will be held at the Daxin Painting Hall for eight days starting September 11th. Those who love Chinese painting should be quick to see it first.

### Biographical Sketches of Liyuan Figures

— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Drawings by Zhang Yizhang

(39) Gao Shengling

Gao Shengling is the son of Qingkui. When Qingkui was at his peak, Shengling borrowed his father's promotion and did not show any special talent. When Qingkui's voice declined, he began to work hard and diligently in order to support the family. Xiaolou devoted himself to his work, and before long, he stood out among his peers and showed his talent. However, Xiaolou passed away suddenly, and he did not have time to guide him to the hall. Shengling's learning of Xiaolou follows the rules and regulations, and he is quite disciplined. Moreover, his voice is clear and bright, and it is vaguely similar. Although Xiaolou's exquisite and profound creations are like a journey of thousands of miles, which cannot be reached by a junior's hard work, Shengling still retains one or two tenths of his style, which is already rare and can be called a talent among the mediocre. However, Shengling has recently been showing signs of laziness on stage, as if he thinks that Xiaolou has always been known for his laziness, so he deliberately imitates it. Xiaolou occasionally made mistakes due to relaxation in middle age, but he reversed this flaw in his later years. His strength was sometimes insufficient, but he did not deliberately act in this way to show off. Now that Shengling has not been able to fully prepare all of Xiaolou's beauty, only "laziness is the key", it is no less than sealing his steps and stopping where he should not stop, which is a pity for such a promising talent!

### Blood Rain on Fine Jade

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter Sixteen: Escaping the Cage Early with a Delicate Bird

Seeing that the sky had already darkened, bright lanterns were lit everywhere in the residence, and a servant came in to report the arrival of General Wu. Tian Hongyu hurriedly opened the main gate to greet him. He saw Wu Sangui in military uniform, accompanied by four guards, exuding an air of inviolability, which startled him inwardly. He respectfully ushered him into the Siwei Hall, and after the host and guest were seated, they exchanged a few polite remarks. Wu Sangui, seeing that there were no female musicians, deliberately said, "I am calling this evening to thank the Father-in-Law for his hospitality, but in military attire, I cannot stay long and must take my leave." Tian Hongyu said, "It is rare for the General to come here, gracing my humble abode with his presence. I was hoping to have a drink and a chat, to pour out my heart. Why are you in such a hurry to leave? I hope the General will stay for a while since he has come." Wu Sangui nodded slightly. Tian Hongyu then led Wu Sangui to the Hongqing Pavilion to take his seat. The pavilion was brightly lit with candles, and the walls were magnificent, resembling a small palace. A lavish feast was laid out in the center. Tian Hongyu invited Wu Sangui to take the seat of honor. Wu Sangui politely declined once before sitting at the head of the guest seat, looking around, truly impressed by the magnificence. Tian Hongyu usually had such comforts, which was not easy, but unfortunately, the world was in chaos, the capital was uneasy, and he feared that this kind of enjoyment might not last long. After Tian Hongyu poured the wine, he ordered the female musicians to come and serve. In a moment, the sound of jade pendants jingled, and clothes rustled. A group of female musicians slowly walked in, a fragrant breeze filling the air, assailing the nostrils. As Wu Sangui looked up, he saw two young girls with hanging hair carrying two crimson gauze lanterns in front, followed by a score of concubines, all of them beautiful with jade-like faces, bright eyes, and white teeth, wearing embroidered robes and silken gowns, with cloud-like hair and jade-green hairpins, holding various silk and bamboo musical instruments in their hands, truly a rare sight. They entered the pavilion, greeted Tian Hongyu and Wu Sangui with a curtsy, and moved to sit on the side, like famous blossoms blooming in a land of fragrance. Tian Hongyu then turned around and instructed them to first play a piece of "Qing Ping Yue." Once the silk and bamboo instruments were tuned, all the sounds joined together, flowing and melodious, pleasant to hear. After "Qing Ping Yue" was played, they played a song of "Ni Chang Xian Zi," which truly stirred the soul. (169)
