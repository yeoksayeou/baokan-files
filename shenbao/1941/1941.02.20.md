Australian Troops Arrive in Singapore in Large Numbers to Directly Defend Against Japanese Invasion of Malaya

Sydney - Official sources announced this morning that an elite unit of Australian troops arrived in Singapore yesterday to strengthen defenses. It is reported that their stationing and supplies will be the responsibility of the Straits Settlements government. Well-informed sources explained that the landing of Australian troops in Singapore is a direct measure to prevent the Japanese army from invading British Malaya. It is also said that this confirms Britain's determination to prepare for any eventuality in the Far East. These newly arrived Australian troops are the second detachment Australia has sent from overseas. Other detachments are currently serving in the Middle East forces. (International News Service dispatch from the 19th)

Singapore - Government officials announced that thousands of Australian troops arrived in Singapore last night. After disembarking, they boarded trains and were dispatched to various locations in Malaya to be stationed. These new soldiers came from various states in Australia and are fully equipped. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)

Singapore - A large number of Australian troops arrived at a Malayan port yesterday. An advance party of Australian troops, carrying mechanized equipment, unloaded in large quantities after transport ships arrived at a certain Malayan naval base. The Australian troops then landed at 4 PM. Upon the arrival of the Australian troops, Sir Thomas, the Governor of the Straits Settlements and High Commissioner of the Malay States, boarded the ship to welcome them. Accompanying Sir Thomas was Major General Bennett, the commander of the Australian troops, who had just arrived here from Singapore last month. The Australian troops landed in a very orderly manner, and the process was completed by this morning. Several dark-skinned Australian soldiers told reporters from the United Press that they "hope to get practical work here." The Australian troop transport ships were closely protected by the navy during the fourteen-day voyage. Officials said that the voyage was very safe. The fully armed Australian troops stepped from the ship into specially prepared trains that stretched continuously. The new reinforcements are now being immediately transported to various Malayan defense lines. The Australian troops will be assisted by British troops in the new defense positions until the former are familiar with the new defense areas. The new troops include infantry and various supporting units and carry the latest mountain guns and assault tanks. The Australian troops brought their mechanized transport equipment, and each infantry unit is mechanized. Admiral Layton, the British naval commander-in-chief here, said, "The safe arrival of this powerful reinforcement is very satisfactory. This is sufficient to show the power of the British army to control the navy and to garrison troops in any area that needs reinforcement. This also shows that the imperial fleet is becoming stronger and stronger, so that no part of the empire has any concerns about inadequate protection." When the Australian troops arrived, military music was played on the pier, and cheers erupted. Australians threw pennies to the soldiers entering the Strait. Dockworkers received the same treatment as they passed by. Several dozen pennies fell in front of the official reception area, where the governor and his wife were sitting. They smiled and picked up the pennies and put them in their pockets as souvenirs. (United Press dispatch from the 19th)

It is reported that Shigemitsu told Butler that Japan's plans in the South Pacific are mainly economic.

It is reported that the Japanese ambassador also requested an explanation of the British press's anti-Japanese threat movement last week. (United Press dispatch from the 19th)

Tokyo - An editorial in the Yomiuri Shimbun yesterday stated that the rumors spread by London regarding the Far East crisis are aimed at disrupting the negotiations between Japan and Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies, as well as the Vietnam-Thailand peace conference.

If other countries want to impose this on Japan, then Japan will take all kinds of defensive measures. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 19th)

### Ishii's Remarks Not Taken Seriously by the US; British Consider the Mediation of War as Not Worth Commenting On

Washington - Undersecretary of State Welles stated at a press conference today that the United States is now paying more attention to the actions of other countries than to the remarks made by certain politicians. He made this statement in response to reporters' questions about Tokyo politicians' claims that Japan's goal is to seek peaceful relations with the United States. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)

Washington - Undersecretary of State Welles, commenting yesterday on Japan's suggestion to mediate the European war, said that the United States values action and not empty words, and said that in today's extremely serious world situation, the US government is more interested in the actions of other countries than in the statements made by their spokespersons. He also said that the United States and New Zealand have agreed to establish diplomatic missions to further strengthen relations between the United States and its Pacific allies. According to Ishii, a spokesman for the Japan Cabinet Information Bureau, who said in Tokyo yesterday that Japan is willing to mediate any disputes in the world, referring to the war in Europe. (United Press dispatch from the 19th)

London - Authoritative sources here said this morning that Japan's proposal to mediate the European war is "not worth commenting on." (International News Service dispatch from the 19th)

Tokyo - The Information Bureau issued a statement today reiterating Japan's proposal to mediate the European war, stating that if Japan is invited by the countries concerned, it will initiate mediation. Otherwise, Japan is neither in this position nor has any intention to act as a mediator. The Japan Times and Guangzhi Bao quoted the remarks of an observer who believed that yesterday's mediation remarks were addressed to the United States and the belligerent countries. "We should judge it by its words and not make overly clever speculations about motives. This proposal is constructive and is the first direct peace activity by the Axis powers. Britain and the United States should seize this good opportunity." (Reuters dispatch)

### US Authorities are Discussing a Rotating Naval Plan to Support Britain on the One Hand and Restrain Japan on the Other

Washington - According to well-informed sources here, US authorities are currently discussing a rotating naval plan to assist Britain on the one hand and prevent Japan from assisting its Axis allies on the other. According to the New York Times, the first plan under discussion is for the United States to exchange its destroyers or cruisers with Britain in place of the same number and type of British ships entering the United States for repairs. Another plan is for the United States to exchange several small warships with Britain in exchange for British warships that the US can use in the Pacific. Those discussing the above plan are currently studying the question of how the US Navy can back Britain in the Atlantic while making Japan worry. At the same time, some commentators believe that any slight change in the Far East is likely to cause a war between the United States and Japan, and it is strange that the Japanese do not understand the danger of continuing to create serious situations. Japan must know that it cannot get help from Germany. Once Japan loses its sea power, China will eliminate Japan's commercial and military power. Japan at this time can be compared to Italy a year ago. At that time, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini believed that Britain would fail quickly, so he did not hesitate to make a desperate gamble. He knew that in Hitler's solution, Italy could not get anything except what it occupied during the victory. Japan's calculation is similar now. What Japan is encountering now is participation in the war, ostensibly to cooperate with Hitler, but in fact to preemptively seize a share of Hitler's victory. Mussolini determined that Hitler could win last year, which led to a big mistake and the loss of his African empire and part of his fleet. Even if Hitler wins, Italy will eventually be a defeated country and be controlled by Hitler. The danger of Japan's miscalculation is greater than that of Italy, because Hitler can help Italy nearby, but cannot help Japan from afar.

Japan Miscalculates US Behavior

American journalist Walter Lippmann recently wrote an article warning Japan that Japan is currently in danger of miscalculating American behavior. In his opinion, what is most conducive to peace is to make Tokyo clearly understand that the United States is determined to safeguard its security no matter what. Japan cannot think that the United States will always be neutral. If the Japanese think that Hitler's victory in Europe will make the United States succumb in the Caribbean Sea, then they are greatly mistaken. It should be known that since the United States is threatened by a two-ocean attack, the necessary path it should take is to defeat Japanese sea power before Hitler can attack the United States. Now American diplomats, Congress, and public opinion are working to tell Japan this position before Japan ties itself up. A well-known commentator of the American isolationist faction recently also expressed his opinion, indicating the most folding trend of the isolationist faction, saying that the rapid race of the United States has crossed the boundary that should not be crossed again. The current momentum is extremely strong, and it is uncertain whether it can stop before the boundary that is war. If Japan's threat to the United States is the same as Hitler's threat to Britain, then the common direction of defense for Britain and the United States is inevitable, that is, the British and American navies cooperate with each other in mutual understanding.

The New York Herald Tribune also had an editorial criticizing Japan for stirring up trouble in the Pacific and praising Singapore, Australia, and the Dutch East Indies for not being threatened, saying that Tokyo has been affected. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is now extending his empty palm and making an appeal to the civil nations, "We never want to harm anyone." May our civil nations forever make Matsuoka hold this posture. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)

### Japan Avoids War With the US

New York - A senior Japanese official said that Japan will do its best to avoid war with the United States, but the Japanese side also admitted that the relationship between Japan and the United States may face a serious crisis in the recent weeks. According to the Japanese side, the crisis will arise from the American intervention in the Sino-Japanese War and from the further cooperation between Britain and the United States. The United States is acting as the "protector of British interests in East Asia" and is carrying out continuous political, economic, financial, and military activities in Washington to prevent Japan from dominating the Western Pacific. It is generally believed that the US Marine Corps will remain stationed in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Peiping for the time being, and the Asian fleet will come to China for spring exercises as usual. The main fleet will remain in Hawaii to continue resupplying. At the same time, it is believed that the Japanese naval side has gradually opposed conflict with the United States.

Editorial

### The Turkish-Bulgarian Declaration

Today's Balkans can no longer be equated with what it was twenty-five years ago. Compared to twenty-five years ago, today's Soviet Union is no longer the main protagonist in the current European war, and today's Turkey, although its territory is smaller than before, has increased its strength and has an independent and firm foreign stance. Therefore, the saying that the Balkans is the powder keg of Europe obviously has a different meaning than before. The various antagonistic relationships that exist within it are more complex and complicated than before; the potential balance of power within it has no stable foundation. Therefore, the various forces that penetrate into it cannot act arbitrarily, let alone control the situation. They are all secretly wary of each other and are generally reluctant to take rash action unless they are forced to. Even without Italy's reckless and unsuccessful attack on Greece, the formal peace and harmony of the Balkans on a powder keg may not have been able to continue to this point. This is one of the reasons why the Nazis have been slow to come to the rescue after the Italian army's disastrous defeat for nearly three months.

Germany's unwillingness to turn the Balkans into a battlefield has very clear reasons. However, it has always been scheming and trying to use diplomacy to win over some small countries in the area to its own camp. Romania, which has already joined, goes without saying. Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, as well as Turkey, which has mutual assistance relations with Britain, are the main targets of the German diplomatic offensive. Whether its intention is to stabilize the rear or reverse the decline, those are necessary steps before launching another offensive against Britain. At this moment, Turkey and Bulgaria suddenly jointly issued a non-aggression declaration, affirming mutual trust and friendship, which inevitably causes great stimulation to the world and arouses various different reactions.

Solely from the perspective of the Balkans itself, it is indeed a matter of happiness that Turkey and Bulgaria, which have always been estranged and wary of each other, can approach each other and show mutual trust in times of crisis and shock. However, what is causing major anxiety at this moment is nothing more than: (1) the existence of the Italo-Greek war, (2) Bulgaria's approach to the Nazis, and (3) the rumor that German troops are preparing to pass through Bulgarian territory to attack Greece. Although the declaration contains the explicit provision that "it does not affect the obligations of the two countries under existing treaties," it cannot alleviate the world's anxiety about the fate of Greece and Britain's strategic position in the Eastern Mediterranean, and cannot help but express regret for Turkey's attitude and steps. As for the nature and consequences of this new scene, various parties have different opinions and understandings. Therefore, it is even more difficult to grasp this future trend. What is clearly understood is that today's Balkans does not have the final determining significance for the current situation in Europe, and the complexity and subtlety of the various forces within it is even greater than before. If we analyze it and explore its traces and trends, the following points are worth paying attention to: First, although news of the German military deployment in Romania and Bulgaria has been frequently reported recently, no matter what, the Nazis are ultimately not in favor of the spread and expansion of the war in Southeastern Europe. If we say that Germany is preparing to respond to the future offensive against Britain and divert British attention with military action in the Balkans, then no matter what, the German army has no way to make a fatal blow to Britain in that direction. Not only that, but its own outpost line has been lengthened, which has also dispersed its own forces and made its oil and food warehouse, Romania, vulnerable to attacks and destruction. Then, it is still questionable whether this strategy is clumsy or sharp. Second, as far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it had previously strongly urged Turkey to get rid of its obligations to aid Britain, and last winter it prevented Bulgaria from joining the Axis powers. All these intentions were nothing more than to prevent the Black Sea gateway and Southeastern Europe from being affected by the war. If the Soviet Union also participated in this Turkish-Bulgarian negotiation, it must have taken the same position and would never have helped the Axis powers open a passage to the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. Third, what Turkey is most concerned about should be how to reduce the threat to the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits and Istanbul. This is also the main basis for cooperation between Britain and Turkey in the Near East. Turkey's concern for Greece is also to protect itself. If German forces invade Thessaloniki, it is not difficult to imagine how shocked Turkey will be. It is also credible that the Turkish authorities would never condone and sit idly by the German expansion towards the entrance to the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea in order to win peaceful coexistence with Bulgaria. Fourth, when the Italian army invaded Greece, Turkey did not fulfill its obligation to aid Greece. In this Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression declaration, there is also no tendency to prevent Bulgaria from demanding territory from Greece. However, the solemn statement that it does not affect the obligations of treaties with third countries clearly indicates that Turkey's obligations to Greece still exist. As for how to reconcile and use the two after the declaration, it remains to be seen in the future actions of the Turkish authorities. The declaration alone is not enough to judge. And its special statement that the British-Turkish military treaty is still valid at least clearly shows that it has not taken the path of separation from Britain. Based on these four understandings, it can be seen that this move by Turkey and Bulgaria is neither a "victory for the civil nations" nor can it be hastily regarded as the Axis powers have achieved any reliable achievement. Its influence on the entire situation in the Balkans, apart from reducing the suspicion and hostility between the two countries and indirectly reducing the scope of turmoil in Southeastern Europe, it is still necessary to see the future relationship and changes in the various forces on that side to determine whether it will cause any new changes. At present, what is most worthy of attention is how Germany will act and how German-Bulgarian relations will evolve after this scene. Guessing Germany's goal regarding this action, we do not estimate it to be very high. In addition to the expansion of power, which is of course, what it urgently needs is to urge Greece and Italy to stop the war, and to prevent Britain from launching possible land offensives in Southeastern Europe in the future. In short, this forms a very noteworthy link in the entire international situation, but it is not an extremely important link. If we say that this will allow the protagonist of the Pacific crisis to seize the opportunity to stir up trouble that they have long hoped for, then the opportunity given to them will be another case of painting a cake to satisfy hunger.

At 8:00 PM, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech to the nation via radio. The entire audience listened respectfully. The speech lasted for thirty-five minutes. Immediately afterward, sports newsreels and a cartoon produced by the Lishi Society, "Farmhouse Joy," were shown. After the screening, Chairman Chiang and his wife happily left the meeting. The 19th was the actual day of the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement. At 8:30 AM, a commemorative meeting for all circles was held at the New Life Movement Model Area Propaganda Square. Over four thousand people from party, government, military, and civilian circles participated. The meeting was chaired by the association's Director-General Huang.

Chongqing. Chairman Chiang declared tonight that he is confident that China will soon drive the Japanese out of China and win the final victory in this war. He also hoped that the people in the occupied areas would eradicate opium and gambling. Chairman Chiang stated, "We are confident that the Japanese army will soon be driven out, but upon our return, we must do our best to eradicate the stain of opium and gambling." On the eve of the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang addressed the nation on the radio for thirty-six minutes. The speech largely pointed out the harm of opium and gambling. He said, "We have been at war for four years, with 1.7 million Japanese soldiers killed and the Japanese side's total war expenses exceeding 180 billion yen. There is no doubt that we will win the final victory in this war." Chairman Chiang then urged the people in the occupied areas to completely abstain from opium and gambling, which disgrace the nation. He stated, "Eliminating the harm of opium is as important as driving the Japanese out of China. Therefore, we should kill at the front lines and eradicate opium in the occupied areas. Japan is our external enemy, while opium and gambling are our internal enemies. Even if we can drive out the external enemy, if we still allow these two internal enemies to exist, the country will still have no way out." Chairman Chiang further urged the nation to pay attention to thrift, promote public health, and exercise. He stated that since the New Life Movement was initiated seven years ago, the four principles of the movement—propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame—have unified the nation's political thought, disciplined the military, and increased economic production. The main reason why the Japanese army cannot conquer China is the vigor of the Chinese people. To commemorate the seventh anniversary of the New Life Movement, a week-long program has been set. A New Life Movement Model Area will be opened in the downtown area tomorrow, and sports meets and group weddings will be held. (18th, United Press Correspondent Wang dispatch)

### Germany Pressing Greece to Promote a Greek-Italian Reconciliation; But Berlin and Athens Deny It; London Expresses Deep Concern

Hungarian Capital. According to news arriving here this morning, the Greek government issued a public statement last night completely denying the news that Greece and Germany are currently conducting peace talks to resolve the Greek-Italian war. Yesterday, rumors spread that after the announcement of the Turkish-Bulgarian agreement, Germany had already begun negotiations with Greece on behalf of Italy to quickly achieve peace between Greece and Italy. Although Greece has denied it, news reaching here today still strongly asserts that Germany has taken on the role of mediator and has begun peace talks in Sofia, Bulgaria. (19th, International News Service dispatch)

Berlin. At a press conference, a German official spokesman was asked by a foreign reporter whether Germany had taken measures to mediate the Greek-Italian war. He replied that Berlin had not heard of anything about it. (19th, Huitong News Agency dispatch)

Sofia. Authoritative sources here stated yesterday that Germany has initiated "early peace" talks between Greece and Italy in Sofia, but Greece has denied this. It is understood that Germany has come forward to mediate and is using the newly signed Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression pact as pressure on Greece. Reliable sources expressed the opinion that the announcement of the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression pact has placed Greece in a dilemma: to establish peace, or to be occupied before British troops arrive, or for British troops to arrive before German troops pass through Bulgarian territory, thus turning Greece into a battlefield. The Greek government has denied the rumor that Greece requested France to postpone sending troops, fearing that it would prompt swift action by German troops. (19th, United Press dispatch)

Athens. London officials are studying with great concern reports that Greece may be forced to accept a German-proposed peace offer. British officials believe that although Greece denies that the German-proposed peace plan is being studied in Athens, it is quite possible that Greece will be forced to accept this plan. As for the signing of the Turkish-Bulgarian pact, it has caused pessimism among officials here. High-ranking officials said that no matter how the agreement is embellished, "it cannot be said that this is a victory for the democracies." Although some knowledgeable people say that this pact has no impact on Greece's position in the war, public opinion believes that the Axis powers' position in the Balkans has been strengthened as a result, while the position of the Allied powers has been weakened. (19th, International News Service dispatch)

Before the Turkish-Bulgarian Pact Was Signed, Britain, Turkey, and Greece Held Talks

Istanbul. It is reported from Turkish sources that when Turkey and Bulgaria were about to sign a non-aggression treaty, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu met with British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen and Greek Ambassador Raphael for friendly and lengthy talks. (19th, Reuters dispatch)

Ankara. According to political and diplomatic circles here, Turkey's signing of a non-aggression treaty with Bulgaria is an expression of its determination to maintain absolute neutrality. Turkish newspapers all published the full text of the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression pact on their front pages. "Forum" stated that peace in the Balkans is now stable. "Evening Post" stated that this is the greatest success of Turkish diplomacy, and various rumors of the past few weeks have now vanished. (19th, Huitong News Agency dispatch)

Istanbul. The most well-informed neutral sources here stated today that the most important effect of the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression treaty is that when German troops enter Bulgaria, Turkey will not take preemptive measures by sending troops into Bulgaria. This confirms the recent statement by the Turkish military that Turkish troops will remain on the front lines, waiting for others to attack. (19th, United Press dispatch)

Turkish Policy Follows the Soviet Union in Maintaining Peace in the Balkans

Vichy. After the governments of Bulgaria and Turkey signed a political agreement and issued a joint declaration yesterday, observers here commented that Turkey has signed a mutual assistance treaty with Britain and has certain obligations to Britain. However, Turkey will apparently give a narrow interpretation to these obligations in the future. In other words, only when Turkish territory is directly invaded by another country will it intervene in the current European war. Regarding this matter, when the representatives of Bulgaria and Turkey were conducting talks, they reportedly notified the Soviet Union of the situation at any time. This is because Turkey and the Soviet Union have close relations, and Turkey must seek the Soviet Union's opinion before taking any international action. This fact is perhaps the most noteworthy point of these talks. In the past, Bulgaria's desire to obtain an outlet on the Aegean Sea was opposed by Turkey. At that time, Turkey possessed unparalleled power in the Balkan Peninsula and was able to use its influence to support Greece in rejecting any demands from other countries. This was because Turkey was extremely willing to be adjacent to Greece. If Bulgaria were to demarcate a corridor in the Dedeagatch [Alexandroupoli] region to reach the Aegean Sea directly, Turkey and Greece would be separated. In the past, although Bulgaria was outwardly cautious in everything it did, no matter what kind of military action occurred in the Balkan Peninsula, Bulgaria would inevitably take advantage of the situation to secure an outlet on the Aegean Sea, thereby expanding the war to the Dardanelles Strait, which would also expand it to the important strongholds of the Soviet Union and Turkey. However, this situation is no longer the case. Even if the current European war expands to the eastern Balkan Peninsula, Bulgaria will be able to stay out of it, and the spheres of influence of the Soviet Union and Turkey will not be affected in any way. (18th, Havas dispatch)

Capital of Yugoslavia. Officials expressed full support for the Turkish-Bulgarian declaration, believing that it is trending towards peace in the Balkan Peninsula and cooperation among the Balkan peoples. South National political figures are of the opinion that the establishment of this agreement is largely due to the influence of the Soviet Union, as Soviet policy aims to maintain peace in the Balkans. It is generally believed that the only benefit Hitler can obtain from this will be the reduction of the 600,000 Turkish troops currently stationed in Thrace. (19th, Reuters dispatch)

Whether Britain's Relationship with Bulgaria Continues Depends on Germany's Actions

Sofia. The British Minister to Bulgaria stated last night that if Bulgaria loses its neutrality due to an attack in war, then Germany must act first. Whether the British Embassy remains here at that time will depend on Germany's actions. Furthermore, the British side pointed out that the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression declaration stipulates that it does not affect the existing treaties of the two countries. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed yet what action Turkey will take if German troops cross Bulgaria to attack Greece and assist Italy. (19th, United Press dispatch)

### Germany's Diplomatic Success in the Balkans; Allied Countries Express Satisfaction

Berlin. The "Hamburg Foreign News" today published an article interpreting why the Turkish-Bulgarian pact is another blow to Britain, stating that the Turkish-Bulgarian pact is a milestone after Slovakia, Romania, and Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact. Germany's policy aims to maintain peace in the Balkan countries and prevent them from being drawn into the war. It also said that Britain's policy aims to use Turkey's geographical location as a base for attacking the Balkan countries, but this attempt has now been thwarted. Britain's dominant position in the Balkans has disappeared with the conclusion of the Turkish-Bulgarian pact. (19th, Huitong dispatch)

Rome. Italian political circles are very satisfied with the signing of the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression treaty, believing that this treaty will help clarify the situation in the Balkans and also enhance the trend towards peace in the dangerous zone of Europe. (19th, Huitong News Agency dispatch)

Tokyo. Japanese newspapers have all published commentaries on the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression treaty, believing that this treaty is a major political event and another failure of British diplomacy. "Asahi Shimbun" stated that Britain is making every effort to improve its position in the Balkan Peninsula, while German diplomacy has repeatedly achieved victories. Britain's warnings to the Balkan countries have apparently not taken effect. (19th, Huitong dispatch)

All aircraft returned safely to base. (19th, Reuters dispatch)

London. It is reported that the Greek offensive is becoming increasingly fierce. Greece announced its recent victory, saying that Greek troops have captured a very important Italian stronghold, 5,000 feet high, in the central area of the Albanian front, enabling them to control the area from Tepelenë to Këlcyrë. Italian troops suffered heavy losses and are currently retreating. Greek vanguards have also driven Italian troops out of several strong positions and repelled Italian counterattacks. Athenian commentators, referring to this matter, said that an Italian counterattack, a Blackshirt unit of about 1,200 men, was almost completely annihilated. Greek troops captured a large number of enemy troops, including many Blackshirts and Alpine troops. A Greek military headquarters communiqué stated that the Greek Air Force bombed and strafed targets on the battlefield with considerable success. The Greek army suffered no losses. The British Air Force assisted Greek aircraft in combat, heavily attacking Italian positions north of Tepelenë and harassing Italian troops retreating in the area around Këlcyrë with considerable success. (19th, Reuters dispatch)

Rome. According to a statement released yesterday by the Italian military headquarters, the Italian 11th Army fought fiercely for a long time at the Këlcyrë position yesterday, suffering heavy casualties.

### US Lend-Lease Act Passed, to be Implemented Immediately; Opposition Vigorously Attacks the Bill, Attempting to Curtail the President's Dictatorial Power

Washington: Although the Lend-Lease Act faced fierce opposition in the Senate yesterday, President Roosevelt disregarded it. As the "Four Giants" of the non-interventionist faction exhausted all their efforts to oppose the bill, the President stated that it would be implemented immediately after passage. The non-interventionist faction believes that the Lend-Lease Act will pass in the Senate, and they have now begun to strive for amendments to curtail the President's actual dictatorial power. Three Republicans and one Democrat launched a fierce attack in the Senate yesterday. Senator Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, stated that the bill overturns 150 years of American foreign policy and will undoubtedly lead the "United States into war." Senator Johnson, a Republican from California, supplemented the minority report of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, warning that the bill would make the President a dictator with the power to plunge us into war. Senator Vandenberg, a Republican from Michigan, stated that the power of the bill would clearly make the White House the headquarters for deciding World War II. Senator Nye, a Republican from North Dakota, accused Morgan and other financial groups of promoting aid to Britain and issuing commands, devising strategies to make the American people believe that Britain is fighting for the Americans. In short, in the history of the United States Senate, this was one of the fiercest verbal battles. (International Dispatch, 19th)

Washington: When the Senate opposition attacked the Lend-Lease Act yesterday, Clark claimed that he felt the bill had a gambling nature, pouring everything into Britain's complete victory and bringing the United States to the brink of war. While he admired Britain's magnificent defense of its own islands, he did not want the United States to assume the obligation of defending the British Empire throughout the world. Plans that Canada, New Zealand, and Australia have not implemented should not be adopted in the United States, causing American taxpayers to make sacrifices, he said. Clark also stated that the opposition did not want to prolong the debate on this bill excessively and intended to conclude it within a few days. Upon hearing this, people hoped that the bill could be passed quickly in the Senate. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)

Washington: When the Senate convened yesterday, opponents of the Lend-Lease Act spoke endlessly. Republican Vandenberg stated that he personally supported aid to Britain, but this bill would make the White House the headquarters for deciding World War II, and President Roosevelt's political power would become the first in the world because of this bill. Republican Nye continued Vandenberg's speech, asking whether President Roosevelt intended to form an eternal alliance with Britain. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)

New Life Movement Seventh Anniversary: President Chiang's Broadcast Speech

Chongqing (Continued from yesterday): If we make a precise comparison between the past seven years, we cannot but recognize the great progress in all aspects of our country. Recalling the beginning of the New Life Movement, those who were jealous and slandering us said that it was "the result of the anti-Japanese movement" and that it was just a "re-enactment of the Chinese's five-minute enthusiasm." They were jealous of this movement, fearing that the promotion of this movement would be the foundation of our restoration movement and would give their ambitions the greatest blow. Now, those who ridicule us have proven their estimates to be wrong, and what they were jealous of and preventing has given them the most serious head-on lesson. As for the general public in the country, many were skeptical and waited to see at the time, thinking that defending against insults and protecting the country lies in strength, and that this new movement was not the top priority. Moreover, many people who have lost their national self-confidence only know

aiming high and pursuing novelty, forgetting our own history and the inherent spirit of the nation, thus arbitrarily criticizing us. Some said that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are too old-fashioned, and some even said that restoring these four dimensions is a kind of regressive restoration movement, taking the new life we advocate as a laughing stock and stubborn. But now, after three years of

factual lessons, especially in the three and a half years of combat, all of our compatriots, old and young, in the front and rear, who are not afraid of death, not afraid of chickens, and have made loyal and heroic sacrifices, which one is not a manifestation of the inherent spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame? Therefore, today, not only does no one oppose the psychology of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, but everyone confirms that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the foundation of establishing the country and saving the country.

In the past, our general public was spiritually depressed, ideologically confused, and psychologically cowardly. Now, vitality is increasing day by day, steps are becoming more and more orderly, and self-confidence is becoming stronger and stronger. Thus, the people who were once insulted as a "heap of loose sand," with so-called "propriety and righteousness swept away" and "integrity and shame vanished," have now gradually become united, energetic, and fighting warriors. Everyone is united under the general outline of resistance and construction,

fully expressing the new spirit of our nation's promotion and advancement with courage. Compatriots, just compare the situation seven years ago and now, and you will know that this unconscious progress is the most important force for our war against Japan. In these forty-four months of self-defense war, we have caused the Japanese army to suffer 1.7 million casualties and spent 18 billion in military expenses. This is not entirely due to

Our weapons can hit him to this point. This achievement is created by the spirit and strength of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame accepted by our military and civilians, front and rear. Speaking of this, I would like to ask our compatriots, especially the intellectuals who have leadership responsibilities, and the leaders of all walks of life in society, to thoroughly think about it. Today,

There is no doubt that all compatriots across the country recognize the New Life Movement as the necessary path to save the country. But have each of us made the greatest efforts to promote the New Life Movement? Have we sincerely accepted the main points and methods of the New Life Movement and been able to implement them? Have we

Has this movement been popularized? I ask everyone who listens to my speech today to take out and reread the two sections in the outline of the New Life Movement, "Why is a New Life Needed?" and "Why is the New Life Movement Needed?" and also check the methods of the New Life Movement in the outline. Have we done it? "From the city to the countryside, from institutions and schools to the general public

It is true that we have made considerable efforts in the New Life Movement. We initially advocated the cleaning movement and the rule movement, and achieved some success. Before the war, we held group training and summer rural service, etc. After the war, in the past three and a half years, we have devoted ourselves to

battlefield service and rear relief. We held battlefield services, held women's training, launched military service propaganda, and wounded soldier relief movements, adopted orphans, relieved the lives of refugees, promoted thrift donations, implemented air raid services, assisted in spiritual mobilization, and promoted other kinds of work related to resistance and construction. But our work

Actually, it is still sporadic and partial. The effectiveness of our work has not yet met the requirements of the resistance and construction cause. Just looking at our bad habits of smoking and gambling that have not been fundamentally eradicated, the social decline has not been universally eliminated, and the national spirit has not been fully revitalized, not only should the people who lead the new movement all admit that they have not fulfilled their responsibilities, but the general public should also admit

Not enough effort I believe that a nation must be able to revitalize itself and become strong, and must be able to defend against insults from the outside and eliminate evil from the inside. The ancients said, "It is easy to remove the thieves in the mountains, but it is difficult to remove the thieves in the heart." The thieves in the mountains and the thieves in the heart are the same, enough to hinder the progress of society and the survival of the nation. People and nations currently have external and visible enemies, as well as internal public enemies in social customs and national morality. We must overcome these changing enemies at the same time before our nation can truly be restored. (End of the 18th dispatch)

### US to Transfer Additional Warships to Britain; Also Reports of Dive Bombers, Ninety Planes Already Delivered to Britain

Washington: US Chief of Naval Operations Stark, answering a reporter's question about whether US warships could be transferred to Britain, said that there would be no such thing at present, but he could not know what developments would occur in the future. It is impossible to stipulate what may happen in the next six months, as the world is changing unpredictably today. Before speaking to reporters, Stark, accompanied by Rear Admiral Ghormley, who had traveled to Britain five months ago, went to the White House to meet with President Roosevelt, but Stark declined to announce the content of the talks in the palace. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)

Washington: Chief of Staff General Stark told the press yesterday that surprising events happen everywhere in the world, and the United States may soon have to transfer additional warships to Britain. Observers recalled Secretary of the Navy Knox's recent opposition to Willkie's suggestion that the United States should provide more destroyers to help Britain. Stark made this statement yesterday after meeting with Roosevelt, and some quarters believe that it indicates the government's readiness to overcome Secretary Knox's opposition.

### Arrest of Chinese Crew Members on British Ships; Draws Attention of British Parliamentarians; Request to Improve Wartime Treatment

London: Parliamentarian Bartley suggested in the Lower House yesterday, regarding the arrest of several Chinese crew members on the Peng Shipping Company's "Peng Macduie" and "Peng Macgrew" ships, that the shipping companies should immediately pay Chinese sailors a war allowance of £5 per month. Minister of Shipping Cross replied that he had been in close contact with shipping companies employing Chinese sailors for a long time and was familiar with their treatment. Since the beginning of the war, the remuneration of Chinese sailors has increased greatly, and the increase in remuneration for those sailing on the Far East coastline is higher than £5. Although the increase in remuneration is not called a war risk allowance, it can be said to be increased due to the war situation. Cross replied to a supplementary question that the increase in economic remuneration for Chinese sailors is very large. Chinese sailors recruited in Shanghai and Hong Kong, serving on ships outside the coastal limits, received £1 18s 9d per month before the war, but now they receive from £7 14s to £9 14s. Although this increase is not called a wartime allowance, it can be said to be increased due to the war situation. Chinese sailors recruited in Singapore received £3 15s before the war, and now receive £10 16s. The increase, except for 17s 6d, is all due to the war situation. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)

The spokesman also said that he had not heard of any plans for further evacuation, but said that if necessary, more British residents would probably be evacuated. (Associated Press Dispatch, 19th)

### Claim that Thai-Vietnamese Negotiations Have Stalled; Denied by Japan

Tokyo: The Japanese government today strongly denied the rumor spread by the United States that the Thai-Vietnamese peace conference held here had been temporarily suspended due to French protests against the destruction of the ceasefire agreement by Thai troops, saying that the peace conference was proceeding very smoothly.

### Thai Government Gazette Denies Disturbances; Three Japanese Warships Carrying Military Supplies; to Sail to the Mouth of the Bangkok River

Bangkok: Yesterday, the Thai government gazette denied rumors that British warships were patrolling in the Thai territorial waters of New Singara, causing disturbances among residents in southern Thailand, and said that after the government's investigation, there was no British warship patrolling in Thai territorial waters. At the same time, the Thai Foreign Ministry stated that the British wanted to evacuate British women and children from Thailand, and the Foreign Ministry had not received any formal notification from the British side, so it could not confirm the rumors that the British Consulate had evacuated overseas Chinese. According to recent British leaflets advising British overseas Chinese to make all preparations for evacuation, people here believe that a small number of British overseas Chinese have evacuated from Thailand. (Associated Press Dispatch, 19th)

Bangkok: According to the authorities, from today until the 25th of this month, three Japanese destroyers carrying military supplies will sail to Paknam, the mouth of the Bangkok River, fifteen miles from here. The Japanese naval attaché had previously requested the Thai authorities to allow the Japanese destroyers to sail to the area. (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)

### French Cooperation with Germany; Darlan Goes to Paris for Coordination

Paris: French Associate Minister and Minister of Interior and Foreign Affairs Darlan arrived in Paris by car yesterday afternoon and held talks with Blancard, the Vichy government's representative in Paris. It is reported that Darlan will also meet Laval. (Haitong Dispatch, 19th)

London: French Deputy Prime Minister Darlan arrived in Paris yesterday afternoon. The purpose of this trip is currently kept secret, but well-informed sources in Paris believe that Darlan will meet with former French Foreign Minister Laval again. After arriving in Paris, Darlan first spoke with Vichy envoy Blancard. It is rumored that the two may review events outside of Laval's personal status. It is generally believed that before Darlan set off for Paris, when he spoke with French leader Petain and Army Chief Hongziger, he must have considered defense issues in Franco-German relations. At the same time, the German-controlled Paris radio station reissued threats, urging France to "cooperate" more closely with Germany. It is said that "France does not seem to trust Germany to only issue empty promises of cooperation, and there are some mental reservations." (Reuters Dispatch, 19th)

### British and American Banks Adopt New Measures; Interest Suspended for All Foreign Exchange Depositors; Notice Issued, Effective Tomorrow; Cancellation of US Dollar Checks Ends Speculation; Legal Tender Sufficient for Circulation, No Need for Foreign Exchange

The two American banks, Citibank and Chase, in this city, issued public announcements in their respective banks on the 17th of this month, deciding to cancel US dollar check accounts from March 1. There are no changes to the legal tender check accounts. According to reports, in addition to the above two American banks in this city, there are also American Express and AIG. A reporter from the Grand China News Agency visited senior officials of the two banks yesterday. It is said that the American Express Bank authorities only decided today (yesterday) to take the same measures as Citibank and Chase, and will also implement them from March 1. AIG Bank has never engaged in this business (US dollar check accounts), so there is no need to take this precautionary measure. According to the reporter's investigation, Citibank, Chase, and American Express have recently taken another step, suspending interest payments to foreign exchange depositors from tomorrow (21st). The only foreign bank to join is Mercantile Bank of India, London and China. Citibank's announcement reads, "To all depositors of savings foreign exchange, from February 21, 1941, foreign exchange savings will no longer be paid interest."

Aims to Eliminate US Dollar Trading

The American banks' cancellation of check accounts aims to eliminate the speculation of US dollars in the Shanghai market. Holders of US dollar accounts deposit US dollars, use checks, and speculate in US dollars in the market, thus creating the indiscriminate issuance of US dollar checks, resulting in busy check receipts and payments on the bank side, but in reality, it is not beneficial. However, the implementation of this new method will not affect the interests of the entire Shanghai financial and depositor community.

Legal Tender Depositors Not Affected

The North China Daily News reported that an employee of Citibank told a reporter from the North China Daily News yesterday that only US dollar check account holders are affected by the new measures of Citibank and Chase, and legal tender check account holders are not affected. The employee continued that most of Shanghai's commercial transactions are circulated in legal tender, so there is no need for foreign exchange accounts. The trend of opening foreign exchange accounts by banks was started by American banks. At that time, because the price of legal tender was unstable, merchants needed more reliable foreign exchange as a commercial tool. However, this need is now gradually decreasing. The purpose of the two banks taking new measures is to do with this. Savings in US dollars to the above two banks are not affected by the new measures. US dollar savings can still be made as usual. If you want to withdraw, the New York head office will issue a draft. The value of the draft in commerce is better than the credit of a privately issued check.

US Dollar Savings Are Also Very Convenient

Yesterday's English-language Financial and Commercial News reported that the announcement by American banks such as Citibank and Chase that US dollar check accounts would be cancelled from March 1 has caused groundless rumors in this city, even some saying that legal tender will also be handled in the same way, which is equivalent to stopping business. This kind of rumor can be said to be unwise. In fact, the banks have not considered this. The so-called US dollar check account is a recent occurrence. Because its use has become widespread, many rents and other commodities in this city are priced in US dollars. In this situation, US dollar check deposits are quite convenient, but they also produce unexpected consequences, because many depositors use this to engage in foreign exchange speculation, but this speculative business is about to end, because they will no longer be able to issue US dollar checks and resell them to others. All US dollar transactions and deposits can be remitted to New York for storage. If the deposit is small, it can be changed to a savings deposit, with a maximum amount of US$5,000. This small amount of US dollar savings deposits is enough to meet the needs of small commercial transactions and will not make the public feel inconvenient. If there are still people who try to speculate using small savings deposits, the bank can sever commercial relations with them. From the bank's point of view, this new method can be said to be practical and does not violate business practices. However, the comments made outside on the protection of depositors' interests in the new method and the rumors that it is related to the possibility of the United States freezing deposits are far from the truth. In short, the main impact of this move is that US dollar funds can no longer be massively circulated in the market in this city.

### Cosme to Travel North on Saturday

French Ambassador to China Cosme arrived in Shanghai last month from Hong Kong on the "General Pershing." Half a month has passed since then. It has been said repeatedly that Cosme will leave Shanghai and travel north at the beginning of this month, but the ambassador has delayed his trip because of official duties in Shanghai. According to reliable news obtained by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency from the French Embassy, Cosme has decided to travel north by boat this Saturday, so he can handle embassy affairs in North China and make a tour of North China. The embassy contacted the shipping company yesterday about cabin space. The ambassador's wife will also travel with him. According to embassy news, the ambassador's trip will be temporary, and he will return south at the beginning of next month.

### Business Corps Reorganizes New C Company; Enhances Central District Defense; Composed of Members of Northern European Nationalities; White Russian Squad and Armored Car Squad Join

The Shanghai Municipal Council and the Supreme Command of the International Settlement have recently decided to expand the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and reorganize the new C Company due to actual needs. It is scheduled to be established on March 9. According to information obtained by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency from relevant parties, once the reorganized new C Company is established, its strength will be sufficient, and the security of the settlement can be ensured. The public believes that although this measure by the concession authorities is because the current number of members of the business corps is insufficient for normal defense, the tension in the Pacific situation also has a considerable impact.

Reorganize Defense

The new C Company is composed of volunteer members of countries in Northern Europe close to democratic countries, such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, etc., and the armored car squad and the C White Russian volunteer squad. Among them, although the armored car squad has not changed its name, it has actually been changed to an infantry squad and uses rifles. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps Commander, Happer, recently reorganized the defense in the central district of the Public Concession. He has also adjusted it and issued an order yesterday to make a new regulation on the defense of the central district of the business corps.

Rotate on Defense

### The Fang Dan Case - Continued Hearing Today - Little Hope for Reconciliation - Heated Debate Expected

The case of four Chinese landowners, Fang Jiaping, Hu Jingfang, Zhu Ruiqing, and Fang Wende, suing the Shanghai Municipal Council for collecting land tax on Fang Dan land, is scheduled to continue hearing at 2:30 PM today in the Shanghai Municipal Council's meeting room on the second floor. There is little hope for reconciliation in this case, as the plaintiffs believe that according to various documents of the Shanghai Municipal Council, there is no reason to change Fang Dan land into Daoqi land and collect taxes. Therefore, it is expected that after the court hearing today, there will be a fierce debate between the plaintiffs and the defendants. According to Liu Shifang, the plaintiffs' defense lawyer, the plaintiffs' refusal to pay the Fang Dan land tax is based on two points: (1) The Yangjingbang Land Regulations do not specify that Fang Dan land must pay taxes. (2) Section 7 of Chapter 5, "Land Ownership and Land Prices," in the first volume of the report by Judge Feitang, states that within the area designated for the expansion of the concession in 1899, ... the land owned by Chinese people will not be assessed and taxed according to the Land Regulations. (Editor's note: Judge Feitang's report was a special study commissioned by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931) to research various issues within the concession.) The Shanghai Municipal Council relies on this report to resolve various issues.

### Two Children Carrying Rice to Market - Tragically Shot by Japanese Soldiers - One Girl Dies, Her Brother Seriously Injured - Rice Abandoned on the Ground, Taken Away as Much as Possible

At 9:00 AM on the 16th of this month, near the Xuhui section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, two children carrying a small amount of rice attempted to crawl through the barbed wire to enter Xuhui. They were shot by Japanese sentries, resulting in the death of a girl and serious injuries to her brother. The rice they were carrying was scattered all over the ground. The girl, about twelve years old, died after being shot through the chest. Her body was taken home by her family. Her younger brother, several years younger, was shot in the knee and rushed to the Fuyi Hospital for emergency treatment by rickshaw.

A Hole Dug in the Barbed Wire

The shooting occurred on the railway line of Xujiahui Creek at the intersection of Zhongshan Road. Villagers nearby had dug a hole in the barbed wire obstacles to carry rice through and sell it in Xuhui, avoiding extortion by Japanese sentries at the entrances and exits. These children often climbed treetops to check if there were any Japanese soldiers nearby, then successively carried rice through the blockade line.

Children Sneak Through - Japanese Soldiers Open Fire

On the morning of the 19th, there were no Japanese soldiers visible in the vicinity. The children began to sneak through the barbed wire, unaware that Japanese soldiers were hidden in a sentry post about 150 yards away. When they saw the children crossing the barbed wire, armed Japanese soldiers and a Chinese man rushed to the scene in a vehicle. As the children panicked, the Japanese soldiers got out of the car and opened fire on them. It is unknown whether the Japanese soldiers intended only to intimidate them or if they were deliberately shooting.

Siblings Wounded - Rice Taken Away

However, the Japanese soldiers fired only one shot, hitting the siblings. The remaining children panicked, abandoned the rice, and fled. The Japanese soldiers and the Chinese man loaded as much rice as possible onto the vehicle and drove away. The rice they could not carry was scattered all over the ground. According to reporters, on February 8th, two Chinese men attempted to smuggle rice through the barbed wire and were also shot and injured. They were sent to Cihui Hospital (transliteration) for treatment and have not yet recovered.

Japanese Military Officers - Deny Shooting

It is reported that incidents of farmers in the western district smuggling rice and being shot have occurred frequently. At least one person is shot and hospitalized every week. Japanese sentries do not intend to kill those transporting rice, but aim at their legs. The Japanese sentry who opened fire on the morning of the 16th intended to wound the boy's leg, but the bullet passed through the boy's knee and then pierced the girl's chest. Japanese military officers this morning denied any shooting incidents in western Shanghai and claimed to be unaware of the shooting of the two Chinese children near the Zhongshan Road railway on the morning of the 16th.

Smuggling Rice - Seeking Meager Profits

However, according to a Japanese army officer, it has recently been reported that there is a lot of smuggling of goods into the two concessions from the Japanese-controlled area of western Shanghai, with rice being the most common. The price of rice outside the concessions is less than 80 yuan, while inside the concessions it sells for over 100 yuan. The officer admitted that Chinese people are often arrested for smuggling rice in western Shanghai, but denied that they would shoot and injure people.

### Promoting Autobiography Movement

Autobiographical articles are recognized worldwide as important historical texts of all ages and countries. They have been discovered in China since the Spring and Autumn period.

People in Shanghai, such as Wen Lantao, Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Lidun, Zhang Shouyong, and Ding Fubao, in view of this, have especially advocated a modern autobiography movement to encourage young people to devote themselves to cultural undertakings and to serve as models for future generations. Those who wish to express their personal will and life experience and join the movement can directly contact the Youth Literary Association at 175 Gordon Road in this city. Also, the newly published Youth Literary Association Volume II - Issue 1 contains detailed chapters on the movement. Furthermore, for the sake of popularizing the way to maintain health, Mr. Ding Fubao is distributing the conditions for longevity. Those who wish to read them should write to the Medical Bookstore at 204 Baker Road, and they will be sent immediately.

### Labor Conscription Rampant North of Suzhou Creek - Chinese Men Vanish - Forced to Serve as Laborers for Japanese Army in Southern China

The North China Daily News reports that the rumor of the Japanese army forcing Chinese men to work for them has been confirmed as of yesterday (the 18th). Reporters have learned from very reliable sources that the Japanese army has been conscripting laborers in the Yangshupu district north of Suzhou Creek for some time.

Labor Conscription Active - Late at Night and Early in the Morning

The Japanese army conscripts laborers late at night and early in the morning when it is still dark. As a result, a large number of Chinese people have been forcibly taken away. Hundreds of workers from the Shanghai Power Company, Borderun Manufacturing Plant, and other factories in the Yangshupu district have recently been granted permission by the factories to stay in the factories at night, fearing being taken away after dark. According to four Chinese men who were conscripted and managed to escape, hundreds of coolies, mostly conscripted from the railway areas of Haining, Xiashi, and Jiaxing, were busily loading supplies onto three transport ships at the Qiujiang Pier. Subsequently, these coolies were also escorted onto the ships and sailed south. Some escaped workers said that they were "arrested" in Hangzhou.

Sudden Disappearances - No Trace

Japanese soldiers told the laborers that they would be sent to a certain place near Hong Kong to engage in construction work for the Japanese army. Regarding this point, it is said that Chinese workers and servants in factories in the Yangshupu, Huishan, and Hongkou districts north of Suzhou Creek are all afraid of being forcibly taken away, so they dare not travel on the streets at night, resulting in the Yangshupu area being as quiet as death at night. Yesterday morning, the Japanese army conscripted laborers again in Yangshupu, blocking cars and trucks along the way. Although a large number of Chinese people have been taken away in the Japanese-controlled area, as of yesterday, the concession authorities have only received one report. Many other conscripted Chinese people have suddenly disappeared without a trace.

Tianjin, 19th (Wednesday) - The exchange market opened weaker this morning, with London telegraphic transfers strengthening by 0.0625 to 3 pence 8.125 pence, and New York telegraphic transfers strengthening by 0.1875 to 6.3125 yuan (there may be errors in the telegraph code).

### Gold Market, Which Had Fallen for a Week, Reacts and Rises

Yesterday, the spot gold market suddenly turned around. The week-long decline had pushed it down to around 800 yuan. Today, the development of the situation is uncertain, and it is purely a matter of mutual disturbance in the market. The shorts are getting their way. However, due to the consolidation of the legal tender's position, the exchange market will not tighten again. Therefore, the rebound in gold prices is only temporary. The market opened at 6,020 yuan in the morning because it was difficult to buy at 6,000 yuan outside the market the previous day. After the opening, Gonghe, Xinyuan, remittance merchants, Hesheng and others sold, and the price retreated to 5,900 yuan. Later, upon hearing that the exchange rate had softened, sentiment turned bullish and everyone bought in. Although there were profit-taking closings in the middle, the upward momentum was quite strong, and the price was pushed out of the 6,000 yuan mark. The highest price was 6,105 yuan, and the afternoon closing was still 6,085 yuan, a rise of 135 yuan compared to the previous day. More than 20,000 taels were traded in half a day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon, and the off-market price rose to 6,120 yuan. The cash price also soared to 400 yuan higher than the forward price. Decheng sold 100 taels to Xianghe at 400 yuan higher, and Chida sold 100 taels to Defu at 420 yuan higher. Later, there were buyers willing to pay the higher price, but sellers required 410 yuan higher. For swaps (transferring from February to March), the seller was willing to offer 35 yuan. Gold jewelry also rose by 10 yuan, reaching 660 yuan. Guanyu and others remained flat.

The spot price also rebounded by 135 yuan

In the early morning, because the market sentiment outside the market was quite strong yesterday, it was said that it was difficult to buy at 6,000 yuan, so the market opened at 6,021 yuan. However, Gonghe, Xinyuan, Hesheng and others took the lead in selling, and the price was pushed back below 6,000 yuan, and even dropped to 5,900 yuan. Because the exchange rate softened and the bearish atmosphere was weaker, Yiyuan, Hesheng, Chengji, Rencheng Yong, Tongkang Yong and others successively bought in, so the trend went upward and broke through the 6,000 yuan mark, reaching 6,005 yuan. However, ordinary retail investors and Yiyuan sold in reverse, and the price fell again, reaching 5,950 yuan. However, the buyers were not discouraged, and Chengji, Hesheng, Gongda, Defu, and Xinfeng Yongfu bought in again, and the price was raised to 6,105 yuan. Before the closing, the price fluctuated, and the price fell to 6,070 yuan due to Rencheng Yong's strong selling. As a result, Chengda absorbed the selling, and the closing price was 6,085 yuan, 135 yuan higher than the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon, and the last heard price outside the market was around 6,100 yuan, with a fluctuation of 205 yuan in half a day. The selling price of cash standard gold was more than 10 yuan higher than the spot price, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Jewelry gold also rises by 10 yuan

The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael was raised by 10 yuan, with Dahangtong quoting 660 yuan, and Xinhangtong's price being similar to the above price, with the buying price 40 yuan lower, it is said.

### Gold Coins Soar by Eight Yuan

Yesterday, the spot market price of gold coins rebounded sharply, and the cash price soared, causing British and American gold pounds to soar by eight yuan. The price of British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price was generally flat. The price of American gold notes initially fell to 17.10 yuan, but then rose sharply, reaching 17.45 yuan in the evening, a rise of 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong notes was also strong, and the market price rose sharply. There was demand for both Japanese gold notes and Korean notes, and the market price was very good, with the former rising to 1.74 yuan and the latter rising to 1.35 yuan.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Sales Remain Sluggish

Yesterday's Shanghai silk market saw a slight increase. New York's market price was 27 points higher than before, Yokohama spot price was 1380 yuan, and the forward price for July was 1405 yuan, an increase of about 10 yuan. The local silk market remained sluggish. Yesterday, various foreign firms had slight transactions, with 20-22 white filature silk selling at 4,800 yuan, and 13-15 Robison selling at 5,400 yuan. Huazhong also sold several hundred bales to British and French silk firms, with 7-li special grade at 4,200 to 4,300 yuan, and 7-li No. 6 at 4,050 yuan. There have been no transactions from the user side recently.

### Food: Steady Supply of Contracted and Arriving Rice, Market Prices Suddenly Loosen from Firm and High

Since the high price of foreign rice reached its limit, and it continued to rise without any sign of stopping, and then softened slightly, yesterday the market turned from being tight first to weakening later. At the opening of the morning market, because most of the wholesale merchants were holding on, with few selling, the market sentiment became firm again. Not only were retail sales in local shops quite smooth, but also the transaction intentions of floating speculators were also very volatile. At that time, with more buying than selling, the situation became tight again, and the asking price for general mid-market goods was once raised by one yuan. After that, buying and selling gradually became balanced, and the market gradually fluctuated. Floating profit-takers took the opportunity to cash out, and retail sales also slowed down, and the market turned from tight to weak, and various prices fell back to the original level. Therefore, the resulting closing market remained stable. However, small rice mills in Pudong, with the most goods in the market, had poor sales and fell by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. No. 1 New Saigon remained at 85 yuan, 84.5 yuan; No. 2 at 80 yuan, 79 yuan; No. 1 Siam at 85 yuan to 83.5 yuan; Pudong mill at 82.5 yuan, medium at 82 yuan; fire milled at 84 yuan, 83.5 yuan; second grade at 82.5 yuan to 81.5 yuan; Mendan at 86 yuan; Rangoon pointed at 83.5 yuan, 83 yuan; small rice mill at 76 yuan; Dongzhan at 75.5 yuan, 75.2 yuan; Milo at 73 yuan, second grade at 71.5 yuan; broken pointed at 67 yuan, and even down to 63.5 yuan. Many foreign firms have been in contact about contracted goods, and as soon as the shipping schedule, water freight, and war risk insurance are agreed upon, they will be shipped in succession. Moreover, foreign rice stored in Hong Kong has been urged to be shipped by telegram. At present, there are as many as 1 million to 1.3 million bags stored in Shanghai, and goods are arriving in a steady stream, with 30,000 to 50,000 bags and 10,000 to 20,000 bags arriving every day without interruption. If a large number of new transactions are concluded, it will inevitably affect the entire market, and futures trading will immediately see a drop in supply and prices. The transaction volume has decreased to 700 tons, with No. 1 Saigon in February at 96.7 yuan to 95.8 yuan, No. 2 spot at 93.5 yuan, and broken rice in February at 78 yuan, several corners to one yuan lower than the previous day. Spot transactions are also less than 10,000 bags.

Foreign rice is constantly arriving in Shanghai. The French company's ship Ross arrived yesterday morning directly from Saigon with more than 8,000 bags and berthed at buoys 25 and 26 for unloading and transshipment to warehouses. It is said that a large batch will arrive in Shanghai today. A certain Japanese ship of the Yamashita Steamship Company, loaded with more than 50,000 bags from Saigon, is expected to arrive today as well. (Zhu)

Due to continuous rain, the source of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice was blocked, and it was also affected by foreign rice, and the price suddenly rose by 4-5 yuan. Yesterday, it suddenly plummeted, because most cargo owners saw that the rain had stopped, and it was difficult to delay the obstructed cargo any longer, so they all transported it in the rain. For a time, the arrival volume surged, and some of it was soaked in the rain, so they were eager to dispose of it. Therefore, sales suddenly loosened. However, the buyers initially sought to grab the scarce goods, but now they are cautiously watching, and they are also worried about the water stains, which has led to a decrease in their appetite. Therefore, the cargo owners had no choice but to offer lower prices to attract buyers. Since the rising momentum was strong, the falling trend is also strong now. As a result, whether it is thick or thin japonica rice, the price has fallen by 2-3 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of Kunyuan white japonica rice is 107-108 yuan per dan, and Hujian is 104 yuan to 102 yuan. The price of Qingjiao thin rice is 100 yuan per dan, and the second grade is 99 yuan.

Due to the constraints of other goods, the sales of glutinous rice have also loosened. The market goods are not much, so it can still be maintained without much change, only slightly soft. The price of Hong Kong special grade is 83 yuan, ordinary grade is 81.2 yuan, and glutinous rice is 75 yuan to 75 yuan.

### Flour Market Slightly Declines

The spot market for flour yesterday saw a slight weakening. Since the market had been driven up by the international situation in recent days, speculators and hoarders had bought up everything they could, fearing that overseas supplies would be cut off. But in reality, foreign flour is arriving in a steady stream. In addition to the newly arrived 38,000 bags of Canadian flour, a large batch of contracted flour is expected to arrive at the end of the month and the beginning of next month. Moreover, the atmosphere between Japan and the United States has eased somewhat, and rice prices have also softened. Therefore, the tense situation has gradually disappeared, hoarders are slightly selling, and retail sales are decreasing accordingly. Zhonglou brand Australian flour once rose to 24.95 yuan, but yesterday it has fallen back to 24.85 to 24.9 yuan. The forward market is even softer. The price of newly arrived Jinlong brand Canadian flour opened at 23 yuan and has not changed. A total of 4,500 to 4,600 bags of foreign flour were traded. Because of insufficient raw materials, the local Chinese flour mill once stopped supplying. In order to take care of the food needs of the citizens, the authorities have found a way to use foreign flour to supplement the supply. Therefore, the daily needs of this street will not be lacking, and the market will be stable.

Wheat: The supply of stored and incoming wheat is both scarce. Amidst the high prices in the inland producing areas and the delayed arrival of foreign wheat, cargo owners are unilaterally raising prices. However, the mills are not eagerly demanding supply, and the gate price of the Japanese mills is no longer being eased. Therefore, the market is still in a stalemate.

### Yarn and Cotton: Covering Shorts Turns to Longs, Cotton Yarn Rebounds

The yarn market turned stable, and signs of rising prices appeared. This was due to the fact that in recent days, the market had been hit by rumors, causing speculators to be active, going in and out suddenly, creating a climate of fear. Now the environment has improved, and bulls have come back to activity, and shorts are covering, so the market has rebounded and risen. However, the actual demand is less than the day before. The highest price for 20s Shuangma was 1,275 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,228 yuan. The initial trade in the afternoon was 1,272 yuan, falling to 1,258 yuan, and then the price was 1,282 yuan, and the final price was 1,278 yuan. Today, 285 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, and 100 pieces were shipped to Little Luzon.

The morning opening of Shuangma was because the price had turned up in the afternoon of the previous day, and the market sentiment continued to rise. The buying sentiment in the market was strong, and the covering of shorts was urgent. The first lot price was 1,235 yuan, slightly falling to 1,232 yuan. At this time, new buyers poured in, and the market gradually rose, reaching 1,248 yuan. Profit-takers sold, and it fell back to 1,232 yuan, fluctuating between 40-50 yuan for a long time. Then the market sentiment was good, the exchange rate narrowed, the gold price rebounded, and the market continued to improve, gradually rising to 1,273 yuan at the closing. The statistics of the amount bought by each gang during the half day are listed as follows:

Hong Kong 175, Ningbo 10, Fellow Traders 6,600, Total 6,795

### Cotton is Difficult to Improve

The current cotton situation is still lackluster. However, the rebound in the yarn market has made the market sentiment slightly stronger, but transactions are still few and there are no signs of development.

The New York cotton market is quiet and firm. Due to buying by fellow traders and good cotton cloth trade, market prices have risen further. As a result, closing prices are 5 to 12 points higher than the previous day.

The Indian cotton market rose first due to purchases by European exporters, then fell back due to sales by speculators, but finally became firm again due to the easing of tensions in Europe and the Far East. Yesterday, including forecasts, prices rose by 3 rupees.

Transactions in Shanghai foreign cotton remain quiet. In this unpredictable current yarn market, it is unlikely that there will be a turnaround in the near future.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply

The market for mill-made cloth rose sharply after falling yesterday, and the market sentiment turned bullish. The selling prices of various cloths increased steadily. Fugui fine cloth rose from 36.5 yuan to 39 yuan, and Fugui twill rose to 33 yuan. As a result, the price of fine cloth and twill of various brands rose by 1.5 to 2.5 yuan per piece, the price of coarse cloth rose by 0.5 to 1 yuan per piece, and the price of bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 0.5 yuan. Retail transactions on this street increased slightly, with a total of more than 400 pieces of various cloths being traded. Due to transportation difficulties, the purchase of goods by customer gangs was weak. Only Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs bought nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and other goods. 285 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Little Luzon on the 20th, and 181 pieces were shipped to Siam.

Yesterday, East Cloth rose sharply as the yarn market rebounded. The Longtou label cloth (at the trading floor) had its price limit down the day before, but today it had its price limit up. The speculation and manipulation of speculators is truly alarming. The spot market opened with Longtou fine cloth at 40.025 yuan, and immediately fell to 38.89 yuan. Then, as the prices of yarn and cloth in the exchange rose, it gradually rose to 42.7 yuan at the closing. The after-market price was once raised to 43.7 yuan. General scalpers sold and made profits, returning to 43.25 yuan. The price of 4 Gentlemen was 1.215 yuan.

### Securities: Bond Market Buying Resumes

The unofficial market for public bonds yesterday continued to rise. The sentiment of various gangs was relatively firm, and the short side gradually failed. Although there are still many changes ahead, this rebound after the major fall has almost recovered. The major reason is still the selling of foreign exchange, which has made funds more abundant. Moreover, the spot goods in the market suddenly became scarce, which has made the long side dominant in public bonds. The difference between the high and low prices in the market has also decreased. The market in the morning was smaller than the day before, and the price rose to more than 5 yuan in the afternoon. Xinfu's buying sentiment was still strong, and Hongda and Xinchang had some covering. Runde, Defu, and Hu Heji also bought in. Xinhua on the 16th had already sold. Lianhe, Lianyi, Jiufu and others cut off many positions. The market price fluctuated, and as a result, it continued to rise by 0.65 to 1.1 yuan, with a transaction volume of approximately 2.3 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 300 shares of Yeping stock were traded, with a price of 4.8 yuan.

London, 18th (Tuesday) - The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British companies in the Far East remained flat today. Only HSBC's London-registered shares rose by 2 pounds, with a price of 72 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

The Pading Oak Company, managed by Xiangmao Foreign Firm, will pay an interim dividend of 0.15 yuan per share on the 27th of this month for the one-year period ending at the end of April 1941.

### Coarse Grains: Abundant Arrivals and Storage of Yellow Soybeans, Market Remains Flat and Listless

The soybean market has not changed due to the insane situation of soybean cake. The source of arrivals is continuous, and the current stock is no less than 80,000 to 90,000 bags. As for sales, only the timber street export is suitable for handling. The sales markets of oil mills are mostly directly transported by Japanese merchants, so the overall development is weak and it is often in a state of flatness and fatigue. Yesterday's market was still the same. About 500 bags of Qingdao soybeans were purchased by the Hong Kong gang at a price of 38.5 yuan. About 700 bags of Tianjin soybeans were purchased by the Hong Kong gang at a price of 40.05 yuan. The rest of the traders in the market inquired about 600 bags of Guidetu soybeans at a price of 37.5 to 37 yuan, 100 bags of Wuhu soybeans at a price of 37.1 yuan, and 200 bags of Tianjin green beans at a price of 35.8 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Turns Down

Yesterday's sugar market sentiment was downward, with more sellers and a declining trend. The association's prices for spot coarse white were 82 yuan to 82.5 yuan for the warehouse, and 81.7 to 81.95 yuan for outside warehouses, a difference of 1.15 yuan. For shipment on the 10th of next month and at the end of this month, the price was 81 yuan, 81 yuan, 80.08 yuan. For Taikoo Car White B Mark at the west warehouse, the price was 81.5 to 81 yuan, and for the east warehouse, the price was 81 to 81.05 yuan, a difference of 1.1 yuan. For DY Mark at the west warehouse, the price was 80.7 to 79.5 yuan, and for HX Mark at the west warehouse, the price was 80.2 to 79.3 yuan, a difference of 0.9 yuan. For Dutch red spot, the price was 62.8 to 62.5 yuan, 0.5 yuan lower than the previous day (17th). For this mill's No. 1 crystal, the price was 103 yuan, and for crystal ice, the price was 104 yuan.

### North and South Goods: Daylily Turns Loose

Recently, the daylily market has been sluggish because the sales of various gangs are weak and the red disk price is too high, and the prices have dropped by about 5 yuan. Yesterday, the top grade daylily was sold at 155 yuan to 150 yuan, and the next grade was 140 yuan to 130 yuan. However, the producing price is still too expensive.

### Marine Products: Arrowroot Flour Soars

The price of arrowroot flour has been rising repeatedly because the source is feared to be blocked and the hoarders are active. Yesterday, Feiqilin mark reached 125 yuan, KG mark reached 120 yuan, ShuangT mark reached 80 yuan, and both large and small granular sago reached 90 yuan.

### Both Black and White Pepper are Tight

The market for pepper is also very firm for the above reasons. Yesterday, the price of white pepper from Wendao was 240 yuan, and the price of Dutch pepper was lower. The price of black large pepper was 125 yuan, and the price of No. 1 pepper was 127 yuan.

### Coal: Abundant Arrival of Hongji Coal Ash, Prices Still Difficult to Fall

Hongji white coal ash is the only raw material for coal balls. Although there is no lack of sources of arrival recently, and another 6,500 tons arrived by a certain ship yesterday, queuing up for cars at the wharf, the water freight is extremely high, still requiring 6.5 US dollars, customs duties and other fees, so the price is difficult to fall. According to the industry, the price of No. 2 ash is 168 yuan per ton, and the old orders are gradually being exhausted. The difference between the official and black market prices is almost the same.

Education News

### Recent Developments in Education Facilities in Guizhou Province

(Guiyang Correspondence) The following is an abstract of the current status of education facilities under the Guizhou Provincial Department of Education:

(1) Preparing for National Education

Since receiving the "Outline for the Implementation of National Education" and other decrees from the Ministry of Education in May of last year, the Guizhou Department of Education formulated key points for the first year of implementing national education in Guizhou Province. Subsequently, it received a telegram from the Ministry of Education in September of last year, stating that, by order of the Executive Yuan, national education would be temporarily postponed. However, it was still permissible to proceed on a reduced scale based on the circumstances. After receiving this telegram, the Department of Education considered the implementation of national education as urgently needed in the province. On one hand, it requested the provincial government to send a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education, requesting that the previously approved funds be allocated as before to facilitate progress. On the other hand, it believed that national education should be implemented in conjunction with the new county system and should not be delayed. Fearing delays while waiting for a reply, it drafted "Provisional Measures for Implementing National Education in One County in Guizhou" and "Key Points for Implementing National Education in Twelve Counties, Including Guiyang, in Guizhou Province in the 30th Year of the Republic of China," along with a school establishment plan and budget allocation table, and submitted them to the provincial government for review. According to the newly revised plan, each township (town) in the twelve counties implementing the new county system in the first phase should establish a central school, and each three to five bao (neighborhood units) should establish a national school. Other counties may consider piloting the program earlier based on manpower and the actual situation in each county, to establish a foundation for national education and prepare for the promotion of the new county administration. The expenses for school establishment and teacher training are lower than those in the previous plan.

(2) Preparing to Establish Affiliated Elementary Schools for Normal Schools

There are seven provincial normal schools in Guizhou Province: Guiyang Men's and Women's Normal School, and Zhenyuan, Duyun, Zunyi, Panxian, and Bijie Normal Schools. Except for the affiliated elementary schools of Guiyang Men's and Women's Normal Schools, the affiliated elementary schools of other county schools are still lacking. In order to enable each provincial normal school to establish its own affiliated elementary school for the purpose of student teaching, research, experimentation, and guidance of local education, the Department of Education, in addition to striving to enrich and improve the affiliated elementary schools of Guiyang Men's and Women's Normal Schools, also formulated "Measures for Reorganizing Guizhou Provincial Elementary Schools into Affiliated Elementary Schools of Normal Schools." Starting from the next year (30th year of the Republic of China), the provincial Luowan, Shujiazhai, Qingshanpo, and Gaopo Zhen elementary schools near the provincial capital will be reorganized into affiliated elementary schools of Zhenyuan and other normal schools. The original elementary schools will be handed over to the Guiyang County government for unified management.

(3) Conducting a Province-Wide General Registration of Elementary School Teachers

After receiving the "Outline of General Registration Measures for Elementary School Teachers in Various Provinces (Cities)" from the Ministry of Education in May of this year and being instructed to comply and report, the Department of Education immediately formulated "Implementation Rules for the General Registration of Elementary School Teachers in Guizhou Province" in accordance with the outline and the actual situation of the counties in the province, and issued them to the counties and schools for compliance. Subsequently, in order to enable personnel in various counties who aspire to serve in elementary education to register and reserve more teachers to facilitate the promotion of national education, the previously formulated implementation rules were revised. In addition to issuing two types of registration certificates, A and B, as required by the Ministry, incumbent or non-incumbent elementary school teachers who have sufficient academic qualifications and years of teaching experience may be temporarily registered as assistant substitute teachers and issued a type C registration certificate. Currently, thirty-seven counties, including Guiyang, have complied and reported, with a total of 2,559 registered personnel. The remaining counties are also rushing to complete the process.

(4) Subsidizing Equipment for Provincial and County-Level People's Education Centers

The equipment of people's education centers at the provincial and county levels in Guizhou Province urgently needs to be improved. The Department of Education previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for subsidies for equipment expenses. The Ministry ordered that subsidies be given first to the centers managed by personnel dispatched by the province to participate in the "Training Class for Directors of People's Education Centers in Various Provinces and Cities" who have passed the training. A total of 1,000 yuan was subsidized for the equipment expenses of the Provincial Guiyang People's Education Center, and 500 yuan was subsidized for each of the thirty-two centers, including the Provincial Zunyi People's Education Center and the Longli County People's Education Center, totaling 17,000 yuan. The Department of Education followed the Ministry's regulations and, considering the province's financial resources, drafted the "Guizhou Provincial Government's Measures for Subsidizing Provincial and County-Level People's Education Centers in the 29th Year," mirroring the Ministry's subsidy amounts. The provincial center's expenses are fully borne by the province, while the county centers' expenses are shared equally by the province and the county. A total of 10,000 yuan is needed for provincial subsidies. This has been approved by the 674th meeting of the Guizhou Provincial Government Committee, and the county governments have been ordered to comply with the prescribed amounts and levels of subsidies, and the people's education centers have been ordered to prepare detailed equipment budgets and submit them for approval.

(5) Convening a Supervision Conference

In order to increase the efficiency of supervision and assist normal schools in guiding local education, the Department of Education revised the original "Regulations for the Appointment and Service of Supervisors." Regarding the division of supervision areas, the normal school districts designated by the province were used as the basis, dividing them into six supervision areas. A total of twenty supervisors were appointed, allocated based on the size of the supervision area and the level of educational development in the area. One of the supervisors in each district was designated as the chief supervisor, responsible for convening supervision meetings in the district and overseeing and directing all educational matters in the counties. The Department of Education recently convened a supervision conference on October 28th and 29th of last year to understand the details of the work of each supervisor and to allow them to exchange and communicate work experience. On the morning of the 28th, in addition to holding an opening ceremony chaired by Director Ou, each supervisor presented a work report, and the results were very satisfactory.

Old Ang Boon is also a former Philippine singles champion. It is feared that old Ang Boon will not be able to cope with Carson due to his age, but there will definitely be a tough fight.

Life

### The Extinguishing of a Flame

— Cui Jingtai

My friend, Shu, who was only nineteen years old, unfortunately contracted acute pneumonia last spring, and medical treatment was ineffective. His vibrant life was abruptly destroyed. Not long before his death, he wrote to me, "Watching the flame of life gradually weaken, I am increasingly attached to this lovely life. How eagerly I long for someone to come and immediately rescue me from the threat of death! ..." I silently recited his painful heartfelt cry, and I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. Tears dripped down, blurring these poignant words.

When Shu was dying, his mind was as clear as that of an ordinary person. When he saw me coming, he even managed a smile and nodded to greet me. I walked to his bedside, and he told me to sit farther away from him. I advised him to lie quietly and not to bother speaking too much. He refused, saying, "My time is limited. It truly brings me indescribable joy to be able to talk to you for a few more moments." It seemed his life during his illness must have been too bitter and lonely.

"Before, I was very worried about having no hope of survival, and I was afraid of dying because it was just when I was striving to achieve something. Also, there's my mother, who depends on me for survival. Without me, how desolate will her life be!" Shu's voice was extremely weak in his labored breathing, but he still continued intermittently, "In the past two days, I've realized that all these worries of mine were just self-inflicted. So now I'm very calm..."

"Yes, life is inherently too ephemeral. Birth, old age, sickness, and death, aren't they all just dreams?" I originally wanted to advise him to be more philosophical, but he replied, "No, you're wrong. Life is always precious. If I could regain my strength, then I would definitely work doubly hard to live upward, and I wouldn't dare waste any more time. Don't let life down. You are still very strong, I hope you will strive hard..." Although Shu's words were weak, they were filled with intense sincerity, shaking my soul.

"Really, don't forget, strive hard when you are strong! Once a person falls ill, they will lose all freedom and happiness." Shu was quiet for a moment, then said with great effort, "Wait for me, wait for me, let me rest for a while and then I'll talk to you, okay?" The expression on his face when he said this was even more pitiable. Shu's mother was on the side, simply crying her heart out in pain, and I couldn't help but sob as well. Shu weakly shook his head, indicating that we didn't need to be sad for him. He then closed his eyes, as if he had fallen asleep again from exhaustion.

I wanted to wait for him to wake up and say some words to make him happy. However, he had quietly left this world. What bid farewell to him were also the biographies of several world-famous figures at his bedside.

Self-Cultivation

### Continuing "Inspiring Poems"

— Mu Ne

After reading Lan Yu Jun's "Inspiring Poems," I was very moved, because I am exactly the kind of person who needs inspiration. But I also feel very sorry for Lan Yu Jun, because after he was admitted to a university "famous for its exams," and began to fight for grades all day long, why didn't he recite this poem a few more times, but instead hid it away, resulting in the misfortune of failing three subjects at graduation? So I think that if you have encouragement, but you don't use it well, it is still useless. Because of this, I also boldly wrote "half" a "poem" as a continuation of the original poem:

Suppose (Continued)

Suppose your struggle cannot be victorious,

My warrior,

You only cry, can you defeat your strong enemy?

Is this a little more practical?

Train yourself with perseverance,

Don't tremble like a coward,

Pick up your weapon.

Suppose you get encouragement,

But you hide it away,

Do you think it will give you courage,

So you can get the final victory?

Is this an effective method?

Snow Shadow Smoke Sail Works

My warrior,

Go forward,

Constantly inspire yourself!

(But Reward)

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Xiangqi, filled with a bellyful of questions, paced back and forth in her room for a long time. It wasn't until the mute maid came to ask her to go inside again that she could figure out what was going on.

The strangest thing was that a very rare glow had suddenly appeared on her mother's face, and she seemed very happy. But her father, sitting at a square table, looked very awkward and hesitant. What exactly was going on? Xiangqi really couldn't figure it out!

"Just now Principal Hou came to me and I also met Director Ma of the Education Department..." Her father began to say to her.

"Director Ma...?" Xiangqi felt even stranger. To introduce a female normal school student for a position, she thought there was no need to alarm the Director of the Education Department. What exactly was going on?

"That's right, it's Director Ma." Her father continued, "But they're not looking for a position for you. They want to be a matchmaker for you."

Xiangqi's heart began to beat faster, and the smile on her mother's face became even more obvious.

"The man's family is Yuan Doufan, the garrison commander of Rehe. There's no doubt about his position, of course, but he's a bit older than you, or perhaps...". Her father felt very difficult. "Perhaps you won't like it?"

"..." Xiangqi blushed and didn't answer.

"It doesn't matter if he's a little older, as long as he hasn't been married before." Her mother, lying on the bed, interjected.

"I've asked about this several times, and they've all assured me." The honest father said without any doubt, "And Principal Hou knows my family situation very well, so he explained to me on the spot that he would soon find a position for me in the Education Department. After Qier officially gets married, her son-in-law promised to find another mansion in Tianjin for everyone to live together. It seems like everything is good, only the son-in-law is a bit older, inevitably making you feel wronged."

"Qier, as long as you agree, they will perform the betrothal ceremony this month." Her mother's heart seemed already quite anxious.

"I... am..." Xiangqi blushed and really couldn't say anything. (35)

Science

### Black and White and Warm Sensation

— Lan

In the past, it was generally believed that white could prevent light from entering, and black could absorb a large amount of light. This was a fixed theorem. However, now, due to recent research by scholars, this theorem is not necessarily true. Black does not necessarily absorb a large amount of light and heat. Conversely, it is not a fact that white has a strong property of reflecting light. Black that cannot absorb light absorbs the same amount of light as white.

Ken Li Fu (P.W. Cumliffe), President of the British Wool Industry Research Association, recently published his opinion that black clothes are not necessarily warmer. Black clothes dyed with a certain dye reflect heat almost the same as white clothes. White clothes (such as khaki canvas) used in summer can also be worn in winter.

This opinion was measured by infrared photography. This can be used to measure the heat sensation of various tones, the thermal effect of various tones, and the amount of heat line absorption rate of various tones, that is, the degree of heat retention.

Therefore, black does not necessarily absorb and retain a large amount of thermal light (such as the sun), and conversely, white necessarily reflects but does not absorb thermal light.

Society

### After Unemployment

— Sun Jieren

In October of last year, the company I worked for reduced its scope, and I was laid off and became unemployed.

Unemployment made me suffer from hunger and cold, and made me suffer from people's cold looks, but I was never afraid, and I was never in a hurry, just like the moment I received the news of unemployment.

I tightened my life, changing from three meals a day to two meals, and using my two feet instead of transportation when I went out. The housing changed from a utility room to an attic. I sold some of the clothes I wore in public and put on my father's old padded jacket. In this way, my clothing, food, housing, and transportation are completely different from before, but life is still the same stable.

I took half of the three months' living expenses given to me by the company and bought some magazines, monthlies, and other books, set up a book stall by the side of a noodle shop at the street corner, and earned some income every day to supplement my life. I used the other half of the money as tuition for night school, because I felt that there was nothing more urgent than this. My knowledge is not enough, now that I have free time, I will never let go of the opportunity to go to school!

This kind of life is very pleasant. Although I don't have any material enjoyment at ordinary times, and although my status in people's minds is low, my spirit is happy. What is the use of those boring pleasures, those false scenes? What is there to miss after abandoning them?

Of course, I don't want to live like this for a long time. I am training, I am learning, I am waiting for a better opportunity, I have hope and a future!

### Concerning Hong Shen's Suicide Attempt: Profound Mental Distress Leading to Derangement; Scheduled to Assume Teaching Position at Zhongda University in Guangdong

— Star

The news of the renowned playwright Hong Shen and his family's suicide attempt in Chongqing on the morning of the 5th of this month reached here only the following day via telegram. Now, we have received letters from friends in Chongqing and contributions from Guangdong, both reporting the details of Hong Shen's suicide attempt. Excerpts are as follows:

Although Hong Shen held positions at the Cultural Work Committee and also served as a member of the Literary Award and Grant Management Committee, he remained frustrated and unfulfilled. Since last winter, friends had already sensed that Hong Shen was somewhat abnormal, his nerves seemingly deeply affected.

What caused Hong Shen the most pain was the illness of his beloved daughter, Miss Hong Ling. Miss Hong Ling had been suffering from lung disease, which had now reached its third stage and was extremely serious. Medical expenses were very high, and Hong Shen had borrowed 2,000 yuan for his daughter's treatment. He had also borrowed 1,000 yuan from the Literary Award and Grant Management Committee, but later, due to some criticism from a few members, the committee decided that members were not allowed to borrow. Hong Shen, as a member, was the first to return the 1,000 yuan. To increase his income, Hong Shen recently accepted an invitation from the Literature Department of Zhongshan University, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan and an advance of six months' salary, planning to go to take up the position in March.

In the past two months, Hong Shen had planned to write more articles to repay his debts, but his mood was exceptionally bad, and he often could not write a single word. Five or six days before the suicide attempt, he told a friend:

"I can only aimlessly play with smoking and drinking now," and also said: "I simply cannot write a single word." Madam Chang Qingzhen, Hong's wife, was also enthusiastic about the drama movement. For the sake of participating in performances in eastern Hubei and northern Guangdong, she did not hesitate to send her own children to the Hong Kong Children's Welfare Institute. Before the suicide attempt, her mood was no less distressed than Hong's.

On the morning of the 5th of this month, Hong and his wife decided to commit suicide. Hong took a large dose of quinine pills, while Madam Hong drank two bottles of red potion. They left behind a suicide note, stating, "There is no way to cope with anything, it is better to go, and I cannot manage so much anymore," and similar sentiments.

After Hong and his wife took the poison, Miss Hong Ling discovered it and immediately asked someone to call Guo Moruo. Guo then went to Hong's residence in Santangyuan, Laijiaqiao, accompanied by a doctor. By the time they arrived, Hong and his wife were already unconscious. Emergency treatment was immediately administered. Fortunately, they were discovered early, and after injections, the poison was expelled. The danger period for Hong and his wife had passed, and they would recover after a short rest. However, Hong's hearing was slightly impaired.

On the 6th of this month, after receiving the news of Hong's suicide attempt, the Cultural Work Committee held a meeting, which was also attended by Minister Zhang of the Political Department. They immediately granted Hong 1,000 yuan for medical expenses and decided to hire Hong as a design committee member of the Political Department, with a monthly salary of about 200 yuan. Zhang also stated that he would formulate concrete measures to ensure the future livelihood of cultural figures and writers. However, Hong instructed a friend to write a letter of refusal for Minister Zhang's donation, returning it all, and stated that all donations from friends were declined, saying that he was "by nature aloof and unyielding, otherwise he would not have ended up like this today."

On the 7th of this month, Hong's close friends Tian Han, Ling He, and others successively went to Dun jiaqiao to visit him.

The latest news is that Hong Shen expressed that after recovering, he would leave Chongqing for Guangdong to take up the position of Director of the Literature Department at Zhongshan University.

### A Hundred-Battled Hero

"A Hundred-Battled Hero" is a Technicolor epic produced with all the resources of MGM. Its story is very grand and magnificent, chronicling the adventures of Rogers and his men in opening up the Northwest Passage. There are blood debts, massacres, and arson, fully exposing the most dangerous experiences of human life on the colorful film. When these unsung heroes set out, Rogers had strict selection criteria in advance, requiring sound physique and transcendent spirit. Each subordinate, bearing the heart of certain death, endured hunger and cold, feasting on rain and bathing in the wind, taking mission above life as their creed. The photo above shows Spencer Tracy playing Rogers, giving a lecture to his subordinates, the moment of vowing to set out.

### The Shanghai Opera School's "Marrying Off the Sister"

— Yun

"Marrying Off the Sister" is a famous Kunqu opera, extremely demanding in terms of body movements and singing skills. It was often performed by veteran actors such as Qian Jinfu and Hou Yilong more than a decade ago. Nowadays, the veteran actors of Kunqu and Yiyang opera troupes have passed away, and there is a lack of talented Jing roles in Peking opera troupes. Although Hao Shouchang and Chen Furui can both perform "Marrying Off the Sister" and "Sanmen" (Mountain Gate), one has retired from the stage, and the other has become a vassal in the Wanshou Troupe, with even fewer opportunities to perform the full opera. Liang Lianchu, a teacher at the Shanghai Opera School, not only has a classmate friendship with Furui, but also knows that the play "Marrying Off the Sister" is Chen's masterpiece (Furui is the grandson of Chen Shoufeng, a famous Kunqu artist. His father, Jialiang, once served as Mei Lanfang's flute teacher. When Furui was training, he learned "Marrying Off the Sister" from Mr. Ye Fuhai, and coupled with his Kunqu family background, his enunciation is very accurate and powerful.) Therefore, he repeatedly pleaded with Chen to teach the plays "Marrying Off the Sister" and "Sanmen" to the opera school students Wang Zhengkun and Zhang Zhengpeng. "Marrying Off the Sister" has been performed several times with good results. The body movements such as fire-spitting and horse-riding (although riding a donkey, the movements are the same as riding a horse) are particularly worth watching. The performances of various skills by the ghosts after entering, such as stacking lions, elephants, and swimming dragons, are also very impressive.

### Shi Renwang's New Year Harmonica Class

Mr. Shi Renwang, the composer of song scores in this newspaper, recently opened a New Year harmonica class at the Dazhong Harmonica Association in Jiuxingli, east of Chengdu Road, Baike Road, in response to the needs of various circles. In addition to the existing research class, harmonica team, and accordion class, which continue to operate as usual, a beginner class on Sunday mornings, a beginner class on Monday evenings, and an advanced night class on Thursdays have been added, all personally taught by Mr. Shi. The classes will begin successively starting this Sunday.

The Shanghai Liangyou Recreation Club, due to insufficient space at its old address, moved to No. 11, Yongkangli, North Suzhou Road, on New Year's Day this year. The club's affairs are thriving. Currently, to raise funds, a grand rehearsal is scheduled to be held at the Ningbo Association on the 23rd of this month.

### Hollywood's Best Films of the Past Year in the Eyes of the Audience

— Zan Xinde

The quality and quantity of Hollywood films in 1940 were no less than those of 1939. However, among these films, which one did Americans like the most? According to the statistics of the *Oregonian* magazine, selected from 500 films, the audience's favorite was a plot-driven drama, followed by comedy, then adventure and biography films, and finally musicals.

The so-called most favored plot dramas include "Rebecca," "The Grapes of Wrath," "The Great McGinty," "Waterloo Bridge," "The Letter" (starring Bette Davis, not yet released in Shanghai), "Kitty Foyle" (starring Ginger Rogers, not yet released in Shanghai), "The Shop Around the Corner," and "The Philadelphia Story" (starring Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, and James Stewart, not yet released in Shanghai).

The best three comedies are all related to marriage issues. The first is "My Favorite Wife," the second is "His Girl Friday," and the third is "This Thing Called Love," which has not yet been released in Shanghai. There are also two others, Disney's "Pinocchio" and "Boom Town," starring the four stars Gable, Spencer, Lamarr, and Colbert. In addition, there are two comedies satirizing politics, namely Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" and "The Mark of Zorro" starring Tyrone Power. (Editor's note: This film was recently shown at the Cathay Theatre, the content is very good, but unfortunately, it was not noticed by the people of Shanghai.)

Regarding adventure films, they considered the best to be "Northwest Passage," "Foreign Correspondent," "The Sea Hawk" (none of which have been released in Shanghai), and "The Sign of Zorro," which was released not long ago.

Among the biographical films, the best are "Edison, the Man," "Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet," "Young Tom Edison" and "Edison the Man".

1940 was not a year for musicals, with only a few outstanding ones. The best are "Strike Up the Band" and "Spring Parade," both works by Deanna Durbin, the third is "Down Argentine Way" starring Annabella.

Among the directors, John Ford, Sam Wood, and Alfred Hitchcock are most admired. "Kitty Foyle" and "The Great McGinty" are both works by Wood; "Rebecca" and "Foreign Correspondent" are both the result of Hitchcock's efforts, and Ford is the director of "The Grapes of Wrath" and "The Long Voyage Home."

Chaplin does not seem to be very valued, the reason is that in production, he is not limited by time, he has only four works in twelve years.

The best films are adapted from the most popular novels. According to statistics, six out of ten films last year were taken from famous works.
