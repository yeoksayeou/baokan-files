### Washington Maritime Commission Announces Increased US Shipping to China; Another 20 Ships to Sail Red Sea; Non-Belligerent Status Soon to Change

Washington - The Maritime Commission announced yesterday that it will dispatch more ships to China, details undisclosed. It also added a new US shipping line to the Red Sea. United Press had previously learned that seven US ships had been designated to sail the Red Sea, and 20 more will be added soon. (United Press, 10th)

Washington - The US Maritime Commission stated yesterday that US-registered ships have begun operating in the Red Sea, and shipping to China will also increase. The Maritime Commission did not allow details regarding this matter to be released, stating that "we have adopted a strong policy of not publishing any news of ship movements, lest it be detrimental to Britain."

Washington - A Tokyo newspaper's pronouncements, supposedly from official sources, that Japan may cease its war against China, do not arouse suspicion here, but neither are they readily believed. Japan has been at war with China for four years and has failed to make China submit. This has even led to disappointment within Japanese military circles. Officials here have long been aware of this situation. However, observers wonder how Japan, deeply mired in the quagmire of continued warfare without showing any sign of weakness, can extricate itself and avoid disaster. It is undoubtedly eager to redeploy a large part of its army in China, and a large number of merchant ships traveling to and from China to supply its army, elsewhere. Therefore, its talk of ending the war against China is probably just wishful thinking. At the same time, some say that Japan is making this statement to show how much it loves peace, so that the United States will not immediately implement aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act, because Japan knows that China is preparing to take the offensive once American cannons and airplanes arrive. Furthermore, Japan's statement is also related to recent developments in the United States. According to news from the East, Japan is deeply concerned about the tense relationship between the United States and the Axis powers in Europe, fearing that Germany will ask Japan to fulfill the alliance agreement of last September. Well-informed sources here believe that the United States will change its status as a non-belligerent in the short term, perhaps within weeks, and join Britain in resisting the Axis powers. If that happens, Japan, as one of the three Axis powers, will have no escape. People here are now watching the progress of the ceasefire talks with China with great interest, but the plan to aid China will continue to move forward. (Reuters, 10th)

Tokyo - The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated this morning that although Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently expressed Japan's desire for peace, American politicians continue to view Japan's actions as warlike. Japan cannot remain indifferent to the United States' aid-to-Britain plan, which includes the Indian Ocean within the patrol range of the US Navy. Also, the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun stated today that if one wants to sweep away the forces of Britain and America in the Far East, one must first resolve the conflict in China. If Japan sits idly by and waits for the United States to complete its war preparations before opening fire, would that not be too negligent? (Haitong, 10th)

### Burmese Authorities Issue Notice Restricting Export of Valuables

Rangoon - The authorities previously issued an order based on the Burmese Defense Ordinance, prohibiting the import of items made entirely or mostly of gold into British Burma, except with the permission of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in Rangoon. The Governor had previously allowed anyone to bring such items into British Burma with a total value of up to 500 rupees. The authorities have now issued an amended notice based on the Defense Ordinance, prohibiting the export of diamonds, items made entirely or mostly of gold or platinum, gems, semi-precious stones, and pearls to any place outside British India, except with the permission of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in Rangoon. The Governor has previously allowed anyone to export items made entirely or mostly of gold with a total value of no more than 500 rupees from British Burma. (Reuters, 10th)

### Dutch East Indies Holds Military Parade Commemorating German Invasion of the Netherlands

Batavia - The Dutch East Indies held a solemn military parade yesterday to commemorate the anniversary of the German invasion of the Netherlands. The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Starkenborgh Stachouwer, reviewed the parade of armored vehicles, marines, and Red Cross units. Airplanes soared overhead, and officials laid wreaths at the memorial monument at night. (United Press, 10th)

Batavia - Special prayers were held in churches here last night to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the German invasion of the Netherlands on May 10th. Native leaders sent representatives to wish the Queen of the Netherlands well. (Reuters, 10th)

### Japan and Dutch East Indies Conclude Oil Agreement; Supply to Continue for Six Months; British Believe Japan May Postpone Southern Advance

London - According to special sources, representatives from Japan and the Dutch East Indies have concluded an oil agreement. The Dutch East Indies will supply Japan with 925,000 tons of oil over the next six months. The Dutch representative was the Director of Economic Affairs, Mook, and the Japanese representative was Kensuke Horinouchi. This agreement includes a small amount of low-grade aviation gasoline, but no highly volatile gasoline. (Central News Agency, 10th)

London - News from the Far East last night indicated an unexpected improvement in the situation in the Pacific. Japan and the Dutch East Indies have reached a new agreement under which the Dutch East Indies will supply Japan with another 925,000 tons of oil over the next six months. The significance of this agreement is that the Dutch East Indies will continue the oil supply arrangement established last November for another six months. Political figures say that they believe the agreement is a reassurance that Japan will no longer insist on the massive increase it had repeatedly hoped for, and also state that this fact may indicate that Tokyo wants to do its utmost to resolve the war in China and postpone its southern advance for the time being. Judging from the situation, we can see that Japan does not want to provoke conflict in the Pacific at this time. However, there is one fact of far-reaching significance, which is not revealed by British diplomatic sources: the Japan-Axis Pact of last September contained a secret clause stating that if the United States entered the war due to the provocation of Germany and Italy, Japan would not necessarily have to join the war to help the Axis powers. Diplomats believe that this secret provision is largely based on Japan's own decision as to who is the instigator. In other words, if Japan believes that going to war with the United States is detrimental to Japan, then Japan does not have to blame the United States when the situation predicted by the secret clause occurs. As early as last October, European diplomats learned of this secret clause, but it has only now been confirmed. (United Press, 10th)

Tokyo - The Kobe Shimbun recently reported that although negotiations are underway between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, the attitude of the Dutch East Indies authorities towards Japan has not improved. Restrictions on the activities of Japanese residents in the territory are becoming increasingly strict. According to information received, foreigners who wish to enter the Minahasa province of West Celebes must first obtain permission from the military authorities in Manado. Although this measure is nominally intended to prevent foreign fifth columnists, it is actually aimed at Japanese residents. Not only that, but the Dutch East Indies authorities have also stipulated that Japanese sailors can only land at Manado port and are not allowed to land anywhere else. In addition, Japanese who land must pay a deposit of 150 Dutch guilders (approximately 240 Japanese yen). This measure will inevitably delay Japanese travelers, as Japanese citizens must request permission from their government to take more than 200 yen out of the country. (Havas, 8th)

### US Senate Opposes Escort

Washington - There are differing opinions on whether President Roosevelt will order an escort without seeking the consent of Congress. Just at this moment, the request for the US Navy to escort supply ships was strongly opposed by the Senate yesterday. Senator McNary, the defeated Republican vice-presidential candidate (opponent of the Lend-Lease Act), stated that he opposed escort and continued that the President should submit the issue to Congress before implementing it. Senator George, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from Georgia, echoed his opinion, stating that if the President believes that escort is necessary, he should consult Congress. George said, "If the President recommends escort, I will examine the recommendation based on the facts. Personally, I do not support escort unless I also support going to war." Senator Walsh, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee from Massachusetts, also held the same view on the issue. (International News Service, 10th)

### US President Requests Funds to Build New Airfields; Total of 140 Sites Requires Over 60 Million Dollars

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday asked Congress to appropriate $66,477,750 to build 140 new military and civilian airfields and to expand 20 airfields currently under construction. It is reported that the main reason for this expansion is the increase in the number of both the Aviation Technical Corps and aviation schools under the Army training program. (Reuters, 10th)

### US and South American Officials Discuss Western Hemisphere Defense

Buenos Aires - The Argentine Foreign Minister and the Secretary of the Navy held a secret meeting yesterday. Although the content is unknown to outsiders, well-informed sources indicate that the two discussed a report from Argentine Admiral Guisasola from New York. It is said that Guisasola discussed Western Hemisphere defense with US naval officials Stark and several South American admirals. (Haitong, 10th)

Buenos Aires - The newspaper Crítica published an interview with former Argentine President General Justo, in which he was asked whether Argentina should join the war if American solidarity were threatened by Germany. General Justo replied that this war is attacking all the principles on which Argentina was founded. It is reported that at the Pan-American Conference held in Havana, Cuba, it was said that anything that endangers the Americas would not be tolerated. The current state of preparedness is not based on mere speculation. We should be loyal to our American obligations. (Reuters, 10th)

### Chinese Legal Tender Continues to Improve; Stabilization Fund to Actively Support

London - Chinese legal tender continues to improve. People here believe that this is due to the resumption of business by the banks in Shanghai, and it is expected that the strengthened Stabilization Fund will soon be able to resume its active support, leading to short sellers rushing to cover their positions. London's Eastern bankers believe that the Stabilization Fund can technically work with one of the American banks in Hong Kong to perform its duties without waiting for the appointment of its American members, but it is expected that the Fund will not take hasty action. Today, the Japanese continue to monopolize the export industry, and the purchase of war materials has increased imports, so the trade balance is naturally unfavorable to Chinese legal tender. However, recently the currency has not been determined by trade. (Reuters, 10th)

### Mrs. Roosevelt Gifts Dress to Madame Chiang

New York - Mrs. Roosevelt gifted Madame Chiang Kai-shek with a Chinese-style printed dress, which was a product of the China Relief Society. The President also purchased two dresses for his own use. In her letter to Madame Chiang, in addition to the dress, she also thanked Madame Chiang for the warm hospitality her son James received when he passed through Chongqing. The letter ended with greetings to Generalissimo Chiang and his wife. (United Press, 10th)

### Pan American Aircraft Flies to Singapore

Manila - The first Pan American Airways flying boat from San Francisco to Singapore, the California Clipper, took off from Cavite at 5:25 this morning, scheduled to arrive in Singapore at 5:00 PM today. (United Press, 10th)

### Roosevelt's Health Improves

Washington - President Roosevelt's stomach ailment continued to improve yesterday, but he cancelled Friday's regular press conference and plans to go to his Hyde Park estate at the end of the week. (United Press, 10th)

Editorial

### American Actions Nearing the Brink of War

It is a universally acknowledged fact that the United States is increasingly nearing the brink of war. If the situation in the European war continues to evolve in its current form, or if the scene everyone is familiar with finally unfolds in the South Pacific, then it is expected that a head-on conflict between the United States and the aggressor nations will be unavoidable.

Speaking solely of the European war, ever since President Roosevelt announced the expansion of the neutrality patrol zone at the end of last month, and explicitly stated that "if necessary in the future, American warships may sail into war zones," the issue of escort has become the focus of worldwide attention. Regarding this matter, not only have various bureaus in Washington repeatedly issued explicit statements, but there is no doubt that the US Navy itself is also undertaking the necessary preparations in reality. Moreover, at a time when the Senate is about to formally debate the escort bill, on the one hand, the House of Representatives has already passed the "bill to requisition Axis merchant ships," and on the other hand, the government authorities have arrested German and Italian expatriates. It is reported that the American authorities have begun to implement "lightning-style searches and arrests" of German and Italian journalists, sailors, and other suspicious individuals residing in the United States. These measures are sufficient to show that the relationship between the United States and the Axis powers has reached the stage of close combat, and at the same time, it can be seen that the American government and public opinion indeed have the determination to burn their boats and risk war.

Once the escort method is implemented, the natural consequence will be armed encroachment from the Axis countries, because the German authorities have repeatedly declared; "All ships that enter any war zone designated by Germany, including American warships, will be sunk by Germany." Therefore, if we do not talk about escort, it is fine, but if we talk about escort, we must consider the worst-case scenario in advance, that is, consider the possibility of participating in the war. Therefore, since President Roosevelt and other authorities in the United States have recently issued repeated warnings and speeches, hoping to awaken the American people's attention to and understanding of the current crisis. In short, officials in Washington want to make the entire country understand that if Britain is defeated, the United States and other countries on the American continent will not be able to escape the disaster of being invaded by the Axis powers. Therefore, instead of waiting for Britain to fail and then being forced to fight, it would be better to help Britain as much as possible at this time, so that it will not be defeated, so that it will win, to avoid or reduce the crisis of the United States being directly invaded. If getting involved in the war because of aiding Britain happens, the price will be lighter than fighting by itself in the future, because participating in the war today is a situation of British-American cooperation, while fighting in the future will become a dangerous moment of independent resistance.

Given that the American isolationists are still stubbornly obstructing, it is expected that the escort bill will have to go through a heated debate before it passes Congress, but if one reads through the "bombastic speeches" issued by several important American figures in recent days, it is not difficult for the world to imagine that the idea of American warships escorting, and even the idea of directly participating in the war, has already reached more than 50% maturity in American public opinion. Because if this were not the case, then Stimson and Knox, who are now the Secretaries of the Army and Navy, would not have been able to make such frank and bold remarks as they did recently.

In addition to publicly advocating the use of the navy to safely transport munitions to Britain across the ocean, Colonel Stimson also explained that if the United States wants to maintain its freedom and security, the entire ocean surrounding the Western Hemisphere must forever be under the jurisdiction of the United States itself or its allies. Otherwise, the United States will not be able to isolate itself from the aggressor nations' armies. Secretary of the Navy Knox, on the one hand, responded to Stimson's proposal, declaring that the Navy is prepared to carry out escort work, and on the other hand, he announced that all of America's resources, including the vast resources in finance, industry, trade, manpower, and production, will be used for a "supreme purpose," which is "to ensure that the British Navy in the Atlantic, which protects the American continent, is not destroyed by a nation that is openly hostile to the United States."

The expressions of the highest military and political authorities of the American government are like this. At the same time, the opinions of important figures in the opposition and general public opinion, with a few exceptions inevitable, are often more active and thorough than those of the government authorities. For example, Republican leader Willkie has repeatedly criticized the current patrol method as insufficient, and firmly advocated that escort is necessary. Vincent, the chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, shares the same sentiment. Senator Pepper from Florida is even more radical, advocating the coordinated occupation of the Portuguese Azores, Cape Verde Islands, and the French West African port of Dakar with Britain, in order to pre-emptively strike. Regarding the Far East, he even demanded "sending fifty first-class airplanes to level Tokyo to the ground," which shows the intensity of his ability and degree.

These many remarks are enough to reflect the general psychology of the American nation today. If we add to this the partial mobilization of the American fleet, the unprecedented large-scale exercises of 1.4 million army troops, and the decision of aircraft factories across the country to rush to build 80,000 airplanes by 1943, it seems that the world can no longer have the slightest doubt about the future direction of the United States. The only thing we are concerned about and cannot help but say is that we hope the United States will remember the lessons of the past, thoroughly implement the principle of "seizing the initiative," and absolutely not wait until the democratic front is frustrated again or the aggressive front is arrogant again before implementing any assistance. It must be known that one hour of delay is equal to several tons of war materials sinking to the bottom of the sea, several British factories being bombed, or several strongholds on the front line being shaken. May the wise American nation, under the leadership of President Roosevelt, act decisively and swiftly seize the opportunity!

### 54 Japanese Planes Again Attack Chongqing Yesterday in Separate Waves; 200 Bombs Dropped, Destroying Over 100 Houses; French Embassy and British Envoy's Residence Both Affected

Chongqing - Fifty-four Japanese planes, in two waves of 27 each, invaded the city's airspace from Hubei, one after the other at 10:47 AM and 11:25 AM. After the anti-aircraft troops fired at them, they dropped over 200 bombs in the vicinity of the city and flew east. Over 100 houses were destroyed, and over a dozen people were killed or injured. Many bombs fell near the residence of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, damaging part of the building. The vicinity of the French embassy was also bombed, affecting a portion. The American Methodist Episcopal Church's Qiu Jing Middle School was bombed again today. The residence of the American missionary Mr. Reppert, who has lived in Chongqing for over 30 years, is within the school and has been damaged, making it uninhabitable. (10th)

Chongqing - At 11:00 AM today, 54 Japanese planes dropped 300 bombs on the western suburbs of this city and other areas. The former French Embassy was destroyed, and a building of an American church was also damaged. This was the third air raid by Japanese planes this year. The residents here had already received the air raid warning and took shelter in air raid shelters, so the casualties were only about 30 people. The Japanese planes attacked in four waves. A large hole was blown into Chengdu Road, but it was repaired within an hour after the air raid ended. The air raid shelter next to the reporters' apartment was hit by a heavy bomb (said to weigh 100 pounds), but fortunately no one was injured, only a white pig wandering outside the shelter was killed. The building that housed the French Embassy last year, which was also damaged yesterday, had its front destroyed today. The French side had abandoned the house after it was damaged last year. A bomb fell outside the Qiu Jing Middle School grounds, damaging the residence of American missionary Rappe. According to Mr. Rappe, the Japanese planes seemed to want to kill us, because five bombs also fell on our grounds yesterday, and my house was also damaged today. As a result of today's bombing, at least 20 huge stones fell on my lawn. After the Japanese planes dropped bombs yesterday, they scattered leaflets. The leaflet contained a photograph of Stalin and Molotov announcing the signing of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality treaty, and mentioned Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's tour of Europe, and even Stalin and Matsuoka embracing and kissing at the station were depicted in the leaflet. The leaflet also described the reactions of various capitals to the Soviet-Japanese treaty, with the opening lines stating "The United States sees this treaty as a 'threat'," "Britain, to console itself, claimed that this treaty would not change the situation," and "Chongqing is angry." According to news reports, the reaction of various countries to the Soviet-Japanese treaty was published long ago. It is believed that the Japanese planes dropped these leaflets to show "The Soviet Union is now my (Japan's) ally, not your (China's) friend." (United Press, 10th)

Chongqing - The lower city and inner suburbs of Chongqing were again heavily bombed today. Two waves of Japanese planes attacked Chongqing before noon. The first wave bombed the suburbs, and the second wave concentrated on the lower city area. The all-clear was sounded at noon. The residence of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr was indeed heavily damaged in yesterday's air raid, but he and US Ambassador Johnson still had dinner together in the damaged house. A car from the British Air Attaché's office was also heavily damaged in front of the Ambassador's residence yesterday. (Reuters, 10th)

### Foreign Minister Wang Sends Representative to Express Condolences to Clark Kerr

Chongqing - When Japanese planes attacked Chongqing, the residence of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr was also affected.

### Britain Will Spare No Expense to Defend Egypt and Suez; Naval and Air Forces Continuously Patrol the Seas to Prevent Enemy Military Equipment from Being Smuggled into North Africa

London - It has been learned recently that after the British Navy in the Eastern Mediterranean carried back the British troops retreating from Greece, it is now concentrating its efforts on preventing enemy troops and war equipment from being transported from Italy or Sicily to Tripoli and Benghazi. British destroyers and submarines, based in Malta, are constantly monitoring to prevent Italian ships from sneaking through. It is widely believed that Italian ships are taking advantage of French territorial waters. Sources in London said that even with the assistance and protection of the British Air Force, the British Navy cannot guarantee to completely block the smuggling of enemy supplies to Libya. The entire British position in the Mediterranean depends on the defense of Alexandria. Now that the enemy forces in North Africa have advanced eastward along the coast, and Greece and the Aegean Islands are also in enemy hands, Alexandria is vulnerable to enemy air raids. However, the range of enemy fighter planes is still insufficient to protect their dive bombers from attacking Alexandria. This is of crucial importance. The British must prevent enemy fighters from reaching Alexandria at any cost, otherwise the British fleet there will feel extremely insecure. The defenses of the Suez Canal are also being strengthened to keep the canal open. Islands such as Crete and Cyprus are also of great value to British defenses and must be held at all costs. (Reuters, 10th)

New York - Germany's blitzkrieg in the Balkans has naturally focused the attention and emotions of the world on that area, neglecting the importance of developments elsewhere. However, observers must pay close attention to Germany's renewed activities in Africa. From a strategic point of view, the Nazi's sudden appearance in Libya may be as important to the future of the Mediterranean as the war in Greece and Yugoslavia. Commentators have noted Germany's apparent pincer movement against Greece from Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. If we broaden this focus, we can discern a larger and less obvious pincer movement with Egypt and the Suez area as its target. One arm of this pincer is Hitler's offensive in the Balkans, and the other is his offensive in Africa. British estimates place the current German forces in Libya at more than three or four divisions, in other words, from 30,000 to 60,000 men. However, general reports indicate that these German forces are supported by transport vehicles, tanks, armored vehicles, and other heavy equipment. Regardless of the exact situation of the Nazi strength there, it is clear that a large number of mechanized troops have been safely transported across the 300-mile Mediterranean route from Sicily to the African coast. The strength of these mechanized units is clearly sufficient to force the British to withdraw from Benghazi and not dare to fight there. And we must assume that the German generals would not dare to attack unless they were confident that they could maintain their supply line to Europe. Therefore, all indications are that the Axis can maintain traffic in that part of the Mediterranean. The British Navy is very superior in this area, so this traffic is clearly maintained by the Air Force. Under the protection of the Air Force, the Axis has transferred its armored units and continues to maintain its supplies from Europe. Some reports say that the German forces are merely sneaking past the British blockade, but the German forces are careful planners and would not undertake such a secret and uncertain transport with severed support. Moreover, the theory of smuggling cannot be established. Although the nearest neutral point on the coast of Africa from Sicily is only 300 miles, it still takes more than a day's journey to sneak across in the dark, and the route is very close to the British base in Malta, so it is often under British surveillance. Even from Sicily to neutral Tunisia, which is less than 150 miles, the journey still takes ten or seventeen hours, so it still cannot be crossed in a few hours at night. Therefore, it is more reasonable to say that the Nazi Air Force concentrated its planes to patrol the area so that Axis ships could travel back and forth under their protection more safely. The strategic importance of the battles fought by the Nazi Stuka bombers with the British forces in that area is greater than outsiders realize. This may be the reason why the German Air Force can establish patrols. If so, it can show that once the sky over a specific location is occupied, ships can move without being harassed by the enemy. After the British Navy's great victory over the Italian forces, many commentators said that the Mediterranean had become a British lake, but this optimism was greatly exaggerated, because the Axis is still using the Mediterranean to transport its armored units to Africa. Here we should recall again the important lesson of the Nazi invasion of Norway. At that time, the German forces were able to transport troops and war equipment across the Skagerrak under the strong British naval surveillance. Now, also under British naval surveillance, they are transporting troops and machinery across a waterway five times wider than the Skagerrak. The importance of this incident and the Norwegian incident is that the Air Force has changed the old war situation. Anywhere within the range of true air power, even who controls the sea surface is no longer a question. The question is who controls the airspace above the sea surface. The above question is particularly evident, even when the British fleet severely damaged the Italian forces in the Ionian Sea and elsewhere, the Axis was able to use the Mediterranean waterway. Even if the last Axis warship in the Mediterranean is sunk, the flow of German troops into Africa will not be blocked. If you want to block the entry of German troops into Africa, you must use the British Air Force to break through the Axis Air Force that maintains traffic in the Mediterranean. When the two sides decide the outcome in the Mediterranean sky, the Navy in the Mediterranean cannot exist. The Italian Navy will be defeated to the point of no return, and the British Navy must temporarily retreat until the victory or defeat in the air is decided. Although the situation in North Africa is not very obvious in the news, it has shown its military importance. The above points can give the United States a lesson. Since Germany can pass through the Mediterranean, why can't the United States pass through the Atlantic to transport American goods to Britain? Our problem in the Atlantic is not to maintain the waterway, but to maintain the spatial power so that commerce can flow freely as before. (Associated Press, 10th)

### U.S. Government Offers Assurance; Respects Portuguese Sovereignty; Portugal Strengthens Defenses of Atlantic Islands; Confident It Can Resist Any Aggression

Lisbon - The war in the Atlantic has shifted attention to Portugal. Although the Portuguese government has not been overly alarmed by the recent developments in the international situation, it has now adopted ordinary precautionary measures to strengthen its border defenses. Foreign statements involving Portugal have not been publicly announced in the past, but the bulletin issued last night, announcing the deployment of additional troops to defend the three Portuguese islands to safeguard Portuguese sovereignty, openly informed the Portuguese public that these three islands have been mentioned by the US Senate. Although the talk that the war may involve Portugal has often been met with condemnation, the government's issuance of a bulletin denying rumors spread by news agencies and radio stations is the first time. After the bulletin disclosed the US government's assurance of absolute respect for Portuguese sovereignty, it stated that the Portuguese government has not received any requests or suggestions from any belligerent or other country to use its ports or bases on the Portuguese mainland or its Atlantic islands. The bulletin responded to Senator Pepper's statement that the UK and the US should jointly occupy places such as the Portuguese Azores and Cape Verde Islands to prevent Germany from taking the lead, saying that although Portugal believes that other countries will not attack its territory, if they do, Portugal is capable of resisting them.

### British Ambassador to the United States Delivers a Speech

Minneapolis - British Ambassador Halifax said in a speech at the Rotary Club yesterday that victory depends on production and transportation. There are now signs that for every item produced by an authoritarian country, there will be two items produced by free nations in opposition. This date is approaching. The Nazis will soon be unable to plunder new spoils, such as France and the Netherlands, and will have to use their own reserves. This date is also approaching. There can be no compromise in this war. Death is far better than being enslaved by Hitler. Germany is again carrying out new terror in Poland on a large scale, using cruel, meticulous, and scientific methods, practicing barbarism unprecedented since Genghis Khan. In recent months, approximately 40,000 Poles have been killed. (Associated Press, 10th)

### British Troops Gain Air Supremacy; Iraqi Resistance Has Become a Spent Force; British Reinforcements Continuously Arrive in Iraq to Provide Support; The Rutbah Airfield Has Been Recovered

Cairo - Iraq, under heavy British attack, is showing signs of disintegration in its resistance. London has stated that the Iraqi Air Force no longer exists. British vehicles have occupied the high ground outside the Habbaniyah Airfield, and the unstable elements of the Iraqi forces surrounding the airfield have retreated to Fallujah and Ramadi. British special forces are very active in both locations. The situation in Basra is calm. (Associated Press, 10th)

Cairo - Even if the British Air Force has not completely destroyed Ali Gaylani's Air Force, it has already defeated it. Official sources said that Gaylani's Air Force no longer has the ability to fight. A senior British Air Force official said that since the Iraqi Air Force has been eliminated, it will certainly not be able to launch any more air offensives. The British Air Force launched a final destructive strike on the airfield north of Baghdad and Gaylani's Air Force base on Thursday. Gaylani's Air Force base caught fire on Thursday morning and was still burning fiercely in the afternoon. The British Air Force Command in the Middle East recently issued a statement on the situation of the heavy blow to the Iraqi army in the Habbaniyah area in the past two days, stating that in addition to inflicting heavy losses on the Iraqi army, it has also seized a large amount of war equipment, including six howitzers, many other cannons, and many armored vehicles. Twenty-five enemy aircraft were shot down. The Iraqi airfields were also heavily bombed. The British women and children in Baghdad at the start of the war have been evacuated to Basra, and most have left Iraq by sea to India. After the American-made transport planes of the British Air Force carried reinforcements from India to Habbaniyah, one of them carried more than 200 British women south to Basra, and was shot at by Iraqi forces en route.

Beirut - According to telegrams received here from Amman, 2,000 British troops are now gathered on the Saudi Arabian border, under the command of Colonel Ballard-Hurst. (Haitong, 10th)

Cairo - Well-informed Turkish sources here have confirmed reports that demonstrations against Iraqi Prime Minister Gaylani took place in Baghdad on Thursday. It is reported that similar protests also occurred in Mosul and Kirkuk on the same day. According to officially confirmed news this morning, British troops have driven the rebels out of the important Rutbah airfield. The airfield has now been recovered by the British Air Force. Rutbah is located 250 miles west of Baghdad and is a station on the air route to India, and is also located on the oil pipeline from northeastern Iraq to Haifa. In addition to driving the Iraqi army out of the suburbs of Habbaniyah, the British army is now in pursuit. Most of the Iraqi Air Force has been destroyed. The British army captured a large number of military supplies and inflicted heavy losses on the Iraqi army. (Reuters, 10th)

London - The British military operations in Iraq appear to be achieving great success. As a result of the British Air Force's complete control of the air, Gaylani and his followers are hesitating on which path to take in their future actions. If Gaylani cannot achieve some victories, the dissatisfaction of his followers with him will increase day by day. The most reliable information says that the report that Gaylani has fled Baghdad is not true. Political figures here believe that Britain will absolutely not accept any mediation and compromise with Gaylani, but Britain does not give up cooperation with another Iraqi government, even if the Iraqi government not only restores the power of the former regent, but also establishes a cabinet led by people from Gaylani's previous administrative department, it is not a problem. There is still no confirmation here regarding rumors that Vichy has allowed German troops to use Syrian airfields or engage in any important activities in Syria. However, British figures are already watching this situation with close attention and anxiety. (Associated Press, 10th)

### Two German Armed Merchant Ships Lost: One in the Indian Ocean, One in the North Sea

London - The Admiralty announced yesterday that two German auxiliary vessels were destroyed. One was a merchant raider sunk in the Indian Ocean. This is the first time a German raider has been sunk in the Indian Ocean. The other was an armed minesweeper sunk in the North Sea. The German raider sunk in the Indian Ocean by the British ship "Cornwall" may have been the former Hansa merchant ship, displacing 10,000 tons, with a speed of 19 knots, and armed with six 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes and minelaying equipment. Such raiders carry a large number of crew members so that they can dispatch crews to operate captured enemy ships. The ship sunk by the British ship "Cornwall" carried a total of 300 crew members. The British Admiralty stated that the British Navy is intensifying patrols in the Indian Ocean to eliminate raiders from the shipping lanes. This is the first successful strike, as the main supplies from Australia or the United States are now heading to the Middle East battlefield via the Indian Ocean.

### Random Notes on the European War (53): Hitler's Desire for the Near East

Modern warfare cannot be carried out without oil. Airplanes, warships, tanks, artillery vehicles, and transport vehicles cannot move without oil as fuel. How can one even talk about warfare? Hitler's desire for the Near East has more than one strategic reason, but the main reason cannot be separated from the oil issue. Of course, after he controlled Romania, the oil reserves there could be used by him, but in fact, the consumption of oil in this war is considerable. It would be best if the oil fields of Iraq could also be brought under German control, or at least not be used by Britain, reducing the power of the British Navy in the Mediterranean. The general situation of oil in the Near East and its relationship to this European war are explained below:

The country with the highest oil production in the world is the United States, accounting for 60% of the total, with an annual production of approximately 280 million tons. The Soviet Union and Venezuela each account for 10%. Therefore, the production of these three countries accounts for 80% of the world's total. The Dutch East Indies and Mexico each produce 6 million tons annually. Romania, under Hitler's control, also produces about 6 million tons annually. Further east, Iraq produces 4 million tons annually, and Iran produces 10 million tons.

Hitler's attack on the Near East is a means. His ultimate goal is, of course, still on Britain. Therefore, we must first understand the oil production situation in Britain and Germany. Britain can be said to have almost no oil production. However, its navy is strong, dominates the sea, and has a large tonnage of oil tankers, allowing it to move freely at sea. Even in peacetime, 60% of Britain's annual oil consumption comes from across the Atlantic. Since the German army has successively captured major cities in Europe, the European oil market has long been closed. As a result, Britain imports even more from the United States. When necessary, Britain can also obtain supplies from Iraq and the Dutch East Indies in the east via sea routes. The transportation routes are the Mediterranean or around the Cape of Good Hope. The world's oil consumption has not increased compared to before the war, and has even decreased due to the efforts of various countries to implement controls.

Under any circumstances, the United States' oil production and its rich underground reserves always rank first. Even before the war, the serious problem of excess oil had not been resolved. For this reason, as long as the British Navy can hold the sea, the supply of oil will not be difficult. In terms of oil tankers, Britain was originally one of the best in the world, and now Britain owns many Norwegian oil tankers, the tonnage of which ranks third in the world. As for the United States' oil tankers, although not as good as Britain's, helping to transport oil to Britain is also no problem. In terms of oil transportation, Britain certainly has an advantage over Germany.

What is the situation of Germany's oil supply? Unlike Britain, Germany has some small oil fields within its territory. In addition, Germans also refine a kind of substitute oil, and there are many such refineries. In short, for Germany (including Austria, Czechoslovakia, and western Poland), domestic oil production in 1941 was approximately 4 million tons. This number is certainly not satisfactory to the Germans, because even in peacetime, Germany's annual consumption requires 6 million tons. As for Greater Germany, Italy, and other occupied countries combined, the annual consumption requires 20 million tons. In addition to supplying the huge amount of consumption by the army and air force on the battlefield, Germany must also take care of the daily uses of the country, its ally Italy – which has no oil production itself – and other occupied countries with its own oil production and imports from abroad.

Therefore, Germany must solve the oil problem by seeing how much foreign countries can supply. Romania's oil fields can produce 6 million tons of crude oil annually. Now that Romania is under German control, there is no need to plan any further regarding the oil problem. Since Germany and the Soviet Union signed the non-aggression pact, everyone thought that Germany could obtain a large amount of oil from the Soviet Union. In fact, although the Soviet Union's production ranks second in the world, its domestic industrial and agricultural sectors have been vigorously developed in the past decade, and oil consumption is very large. Apart from the transportation problem, it is impossible for the Soviet Union to transport oil abroad without affecting the domestic economic situation. In 1939, the Soviet Union exported only 500,000 tons of oil. Under the current circumstances, no matter what threats are made, the Soviet Union can give up everything, but it will never hand over the Caucasus oil fields to others.

The Baku oil fields, which the Germans are coveting, and the oil production in northern Iraq and the Persian Gulf, will have to be seized sooner or later. Currently, only Romania is under control, but there is no way to transport the 6 million tons produced by Romania annually to Germany, because oil transportation is different from other types of transportation. It is not like timber or coal, which can be loaded on any ship or train, or stacked anywhere. Oil transportation must use specially made ships or trains, and ports and stations must have tank cars and pipeline equipment, and there must also be warehouses and tank cars along the way for transshipment at any time. The transportation lines between Germany and Romania are the Danube River and two or three east-west railways.

From all perspectives, Germany can only obtain approximately 2 million tons of oil from Romania this year. Even if the domestic oil refineries can continue to operate as usual and include some other small sources, Germany can only obtain 6 million tons to supply countries that normally consume 20 million tons annually. The oil needed by the German military on various battlefields is not even counted in this number.

### US Government Personnel Arresting Italian Residents, Simultaneously Using "Dollar Diplomacy" to Undermine German and Italian Aviation Foundations in South America, Germany Protests US Confiscation of Foreign Ships

Washington - Federal government personnel yesterday began arresting 90 Italian foreigners who were previously employed at the Italian exhibition at the New York World's Fair. Their crime is having expired passports and illegally entering the US. (United Press, 10th)

New York - Yesterday, many armed police officers, detectives, and immigration agents raided luxurious hotels, restaurants, and clubs, conducting lightning-fast arrests of Italian residents. A total of 101 Italian residents were arrested, and the search continued for 15 other residents who had overstayed their visas. This large-scale arrest of Italian residents follows closely after the search and arrest of German sailors in various US ports on Thursday. (International News Agency, 10th)

New York - One hundred and sixty German sailors were arrested on Wednesday. It is now heard that several Italian sailors have also been arrested, and dozens more are being searched because their period of stay in the US has exceeded the permitted time limit. (Reuters, 10th)

Washington - It was learned yesterday that the US government has embarked on a large-scale campaign to eliminate German and Italian aviation routes in Latin America, and considers this move a major part of the Western Hemisphere defense program. Informed sources claim that "American dollar diplomacy" is being used to undermine the Axis powers' aviation foundations in South America. It is said that Germany and Italy have been developing commercial aviation routes in South America for a long time and have reached a point where American airlines have difficulty competing. According to information obtained by the US government, these aviation routes could be converted to military use if needed after the Axis powers win. In their opinion, the Axis powers' development of aviation in South America is a clever strategy to strengthen control over South American countries. Its support for Axis power is complementary to Axis-run newspapers, "cultural" groups, and trade organizations. It is alleged that the airports used by German airlines can be converted into air force bases for attacking the United States. The German government also provides subsidies to make their fees lower than those of American airlines. The US government is observing this problem from a military perspective, rather than purely from a commercial perspective, so it has changed its approach and is planning how to undermine the Axis powers' aviation foundations in South America. (International News Agency, 10th)

Washington - The US Attorney General announced last night that the United States has seized the funds of a German dye trust because the trust refused to appear in court after being sued under the anti-trust law, claiming that it does not operate in the United States and is not subject to US law.

### British Air Force Launches Fierce Attack on Northern German Industrial Centers, Dropping Tens of Thousands of Bombs, Flames Soaring into the Sky, Hamburg and Bremen Suffer Particularly Heavy Damage

London - Information from the Air Ministry indicates that the British Air Force's attacks on Hamburg and Bremen were unprecedented in scale. More British bombers were used than ever before, dropping tens of thousands of incendiary bombs and hundreds of tons of high-explosive bombs. The two cities were bombed, shrouded in thick smoke, and the fire was extremely intense. Only a sea of flames soaring into the sky could be seen. German submarine docks and shipyards were also heavily bombed and caught fire. The moonlight and weather were favorable for the air raid. Although the Germans claimed that their defenses dispersed the attacking British planes, the British planes were not hindered by enemy fighters or anti-aircraft fire and continued to fly in batches over Hamburg and Bremen, dropping all of their bombs on designated targets. Pilots reported "terrifying explosions" and "the most powerful bombs dropped into the center of the fire." A German communique said that on Thursday night, British planes flew over Berlin, reaching as far as the Posen area of Poland, and the areas along the northwestern border, including Hamburg and Bremen, were hit by large numbers of British planes dropping explosive and incendiary bombs. Factories were damaged, but the most severe damage was to residential areas, and civilian casualties were heavy. The German communique also stated, "German planes attacked factories in Hull and the Midlands area of Nottingham in England, as well as ports in southern England, causing extensive damage." According to the Air Ministry, the number of British planes attacking Germany on Thursday night was unprecedented. They began leaving England in broad daylight, flying east in continuous batches, with the largest German seaports of Bremen and Hamburg as the main targets of the attack. German heavy and light anti-aircraft guns and night fighters attacked, but were repeatedly driven back by British planes. However, one bomber crashed after engaging with a German fighter. Although German defenses were strong, the intensity of the British attacks was no less than those on Berlin, Emden, and other targets in northwestern Germany. A total of ten British planes were missing. The Hamburg and Bremen shipyards building submarines were heavily bombed, and the industrial areas were also severely damaged, with fires breaking out everywhere. Oil depots in both cities were hit and thick smoke billowed upwards, causing extremely heavy damage. On Thursday night, British planes flew over northern France and Belgium, dropping bombs on German airfields. A German fighter-bomber was hit by British planes, caught fire, and crashed into a forest a few miles from the airfield, exploding in flames. (Reuters, 10th)

### Fierce Air Battle Over England

London - Today, in the bright sunlight, German planes made reconnaissance flights over the southwest coast of England. The British fighter patrol engaged them and drove them back. A small squadron of enemy planes flew over the Strait of Dover and tried to use cloud cover to fly inland, but because the northeasterly wind was very strong, the clouds moved quickly, leaving the enemy planes with no cover to rely on. As a result, they encountered British fighters and engaged in a fierce battle. (Reuters, 10th)

Ms. Jia Jinhua's "Good Parents Song" is a good song for promoting parental education. Its lyrics are as follows: "Hand on the cradle, turning the universe, doing their best to educate, this is the parents' duty. Children becoming useful depends entirely on parents. With talent, virtue, and kindness. The father is important, the mother is important, father and mother are equally important. With good parents, there are good people, so parents are important."

### Yinqian Cup Basketball Finals: Shanghai Bank Wins Championship, Central Savings Society Loses 14-21, Women's Exhibition: Friendly Team Jingwu Draws

The final of the 3rd Yinqian Cup Basketball Tournament, sponsored by the Shanghai Banking and Monetary Industry Association, between the Shanghai Bank and the Central Savings Society, was held last night at the Baxianqiao Youth Gymnasium. Shanghai Bank cooperated better and finally won the championship with a score of 21 to 14. In the first half, each team scored four points. In last year's final, Shanghai Bank was defeated by the Central Savings Society, so this year's victory was a revenge. Last night, the two teams were evenly matched, and the competition was fierce and intense. Both sides lacked skill in shooting, so the scores were low. Only one or two out of ten free throws were made. Each team scored four points in the first half, which shows the situation of the game. In the second half, Central Savings Society's star player Qu Xilin was fouled out after four fouls, and Shanghai Bank took the lead. After 13 to 12, Shanghai Bank had a smooth run and won with 21 to 14. Before the game, in a women's basketball exhibition, Jingwu and the Friendly Team drew 21 to 21. In the first half, Jingwu led 16 to 14. Huang Mingyuan of the Friendly Team was very active.

### Food: Hoarding Tigers Unwilling to Let the Public Have Food, Constantly Thinking of Undermining Public Sales, No Matter How Rumors are Created, They Ultimately Cannot Defeat the Facts, Suffering the General Public Who Want to Get Rich, Falling into the Trap of Big Players

Yesterday's Yang Rice market initially rose and then fell, resulting in an increase of 235 yuan compared to the previous day. The market's sudden rises and falls have not yet reached a stable path. After the market opened in the morning, due to the continuous sharp decline in prices in recent days, the big hoarding players were feeling frustrated. They hoped that the Shanghai Municipal Council's plan to transport rice monthly to supply the people of Shanghai would fail. Yesterday, they spread rumors in the market again, claiming that the rice stored in Hong Kong had been frozen by the Hong Kong government, and that transportation would be more complicated in the future. Therefore, it would be difficult for Hong Kong rice to come to Shanghai, and even the 50,000 bags that had already been processed would be delayed. When the rice parasites heard this, they were overjoyed, thinking it was true. Everyone applauded and cheered, "Heaven blesses the profiteers who cut off people's food!" All the rice parasites, hoarders, market manipulators, and speculators were mixing things up. New hoarding players continued to absorb the supply, and floating households were also quite anxious. Therefore, the market situation was quite tight in the morning, and all prices soared, with the highest price increasing by about ten yuan compared to the closing price of the previous morning. However, after this commotion, general merchants knew that there was no hope for the future of rice prices. They also confirmed that the low-priced processed rice would arrive on schedule, and that the second batch would also be shipped. Furthermore, the rice supply to Shanghai was not subject to the freeze, and the first batch of tribute rice from the French Concession authorities had also been shipped, with the same quantity as the processed rice shipped from Hong Kong. The market then weakened again. In fact, all of this was a sign that the big hoarding players were unwilling to give up, unwilling to let the public have food. Therefore, they were constantly thinking of undermining the Shanghai Municipal Council's food policy for the service of the public. There were also some unscrupulous merchants who wanted to take advantage of the high prices to sell their goods, so they constantly created rumors and manipulated the market. However, facts speak louder than rumors. A large number of spot goods poured out, and the profitable players sold them off. Suddenly, the market was flooded with goods, and sales became scarce. Furthermore, actual sales were not seen to be increasing. As a result, the market crashed, and prices fell sharply. At the close of the market, the price of No. 1 Saigon rice was 128 yuan, down from the initial price of 133 yuan. No. 1 Siamese rice was 125 yuan, processed rice was 120 yuan from the initial price of 126 yuan, Mindang rice was 120 yuan, broken rice was 97 yuan. The original packaged processed rice from the Yinghua Company for April and May was 146-147 yuan, and No. 1 rice was 150 yuan to 147.5 yuan, Road rice was 151-152 yuan, broken rice was 114-115 yuan to 119 yuan, and 115-116 yuan in the afternoon. A total of 6,000 bags of spot rice and nearly 1,000 tons of original packaged rice were traded throughout the day.

Thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice saw Yang rice return tightly, sales were slightly more active, and cargo owners' determination to sell was firm, so prices rose accordingly, with an increase of four or five yuan. The quoted price for original packaged Xijing rice was 142 yuan, and Kunshan offered Zhongguan white japonica rice at 133 yuan. Original packaged early and late indica rice from Nangang was 140 yuan to 137-138 yuan. The quoted price for rice in bulk was not available.

Yesterday, glutinous rice was also bought by cake shops and food vendors, and it also became tighter, but it was still difficult to compete with Yang rice. The quoted price for Hong Kong white glutinous rice was 123-124 yuan, and glutinous tea rice was 114 yuan.

### Vermicelli Market Rebounds

The tapioca vermicelli market has rebounded. After the continuous sharp decline in recent days, Jinlong brand kan vermicelli once fell below the 31 yuan mark. Based on the current market situation, it is considered cheap. Therefore, merchants and actual sellers gradually absorbed it at low prices. Furthermore, the rice market rebounded, and news of the tense situation in the Pacific caused people's hearts to stabilize. The market sentiment turned from decline to prosperity. More than 3,000 bags of Jinlong vermicelli were traded, and the price rose from 31.5 yuan to 32 yuan. 1,000 bags of Yangpaotai brand vermicelli were also offered, and the price rose from 31.7 yuan to 32.2 yuan, an increase of seven or eight cents compared to the previous day. The flat-priced vermicelli from Chinese factories remained the same. Fuxin Factory released more than 5,000 bags, and the price remained at 29 yuan.

There was no trade in wheat. Chinese and Japanese factories are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the demand for raw materials. There is also a lack of supply of spot goods in the market, so the market remains stagnant. The formal market will have to wait for the new wheat to be available.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Follows the Rice Market

Yesterday's soybean cake and miscellaneous grains market still could not escape the influence of the rice market. Therefore, soybean oil continued the upward trend of the previous day, rising three or four yuan in the morning. More than 100 barrels of Dalian oil were traded, with a price of 176.5 yuan to 177 yuan. 100 dan of Dayou factory oil was traded, with a price of 127 yuan. Corn also rose by about one yuan in the morning, but fell back by half a yuan in the afternoon. A total of more than 1,000 bags of spot goods and 50 tons of futures were traded. Due to the lack of special stimulus, soybeans lacked enthusiasm, and trading was distant. Therefore, with the situation of flat actual sales in both arrival and storage, prices fell frequently. Yesterday, only 300 bags of Tianjin soybeans were purchased by the local street and oil pressing factories, with a price of 48.5 yuan. 1,300-1,400 bags of Guide soybeans were traded, with a price of 46 yuan to 45.1 yuan. Soybean cake fluctuated greatly, with the overall trend being large at first and then small, still under the control of speculative manipulation.

Also, 565 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Fluctuations Have Decreased

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listings. Fluctuations in the black market for British and American exchange rates have decreased, as gold prices have entered a consolidation phase. After the market opened in the morning, Chinese speculators tried to push up prices, while British and American commercial banks had a strong appetite for buying. The market showed signs of tightening. Later, Chinese banks Jincheng and Zhexing sold off, balancing the supply and demand. Finally, British gold settled at 3/4d 2 8125, a slight increase of 0.015625. The American exchange rate was flat, remaining at 5.34375 yuan. Trading was lackluster in the morning. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Supply and Demand Gradually Seen to Balance

Since the morning news from abroad showed a slight increase in Indian silver, and large bars and American banks were flat, exchange rates for all countries against Shanghai were down five points against the US dollar, and the rest were flat. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The early opening price for spot goods was 3/4d 2 65625 for British exchange, and the American dollar was flat, remaining at 5.34375 yuan. Speculators initially tried to sell next month's US dollars at 5.375 yuan, and Macgregor and Chase Manhattan successively absorbed them, hindering the market's downward trend. HSBC's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. After a 24.50% silver equalization tax was still levied, Chinese banks Zhexing and Jincheng successively sold to a certain broker and also benefited from the May US dollar at 5.375 yuan. Later, some speculators took profits and started to buy back this month's 5.34375 yuan, but were unsuccessful. At noon, the price of gold rose to nearly 6,500 yuan and once softened to only settle at 5.3125. It then returned to flat. At noon, the spot and futures prices for British exchange were both 3/4d 2 8125, and the US dollar was 5.34375 yuan, an increase of 0.015625 and flat, respectively, compared to the closing price of the previous day.

Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Alone

Hong Kong, 10th (Saturday) - This morning, the exchange market opened flat. British, American, and Japanese exchange rates were unchanged. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai dollars rose by 50 cents to 455.5 yuan (the previous close was 455 yuan). There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Tianjin British and American Rates Increase

Tianjin, 10th (Saturday) - The exchange market opened steadily this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate eased by 0.03125 to 3/4d 3 34375. The New York telegraphic transfer rate increased by 0.0625 to 5.4275. The black market rates for Shanghai exchange and "United Notes" remained unchanged.

### Economic Talks: Feng Liusheng - Bank Weekly

The first periodical in China to discuss economic texts was Bank Weekly. Before Bank Weekly, there were magazines published, and one could occasionally see economic texts, but they focused on politics, middle school literature, and art, while this one focused entirely on economic texts, without mentioning other things.

The establishment of Bank Weekly was due to the efforts of Zhang Gongquan. At that time, Zhang Gongquan was the deputy manager of the Shanghai Bank of China. In the Shanghai banking community at that time, which was full of old forces, Zhang Gongquan was a leader of the new intellectuals. In the summer of 1917, Zhang Gongquan invited Zhu Qinglai, Xu Jiqing, Fan Jimei, and Xu Yongzuo to his residence. At that time, Zhang's residence seemed to be in a Western-style house near Laobaizi Road. As a result of this conversation, Bank Weekly was born soon after.

Zhang served as the editor-in-chief, with Zhu Qinglai and Xu Yongzuo as editors, and Xu Jiqing and Fan Jimei taking part of the business affairs. Because Zhang served as the editor-in-chief, Bank Weekly at that time had many of Zhang's texts. They worked in a room in the Bank of China on Hankou Road. The current address of the company, 59 Xianggang Road, was moved after the new building of the Bank Association was completed.

Later, Liang Qichao took over as Minister of Finance, and immediately promoted Zhang Gongquan to Deputy Governor of the Bank of China. When he arrived in Beijing, Xu Yongzuo became the editor-in-chief, with Xu Cangshui taking over as the Japanese correspondent, Yang Duanlu as the London correspondent, Chen Qinghua as the New York correspondent, and Pan Shihao, Zhu Yinong, Feng Ziming, Xu Yusun, and Liu Zhonglian taking over the editing. Talents gathered. Therefore, Bank Weekly's reputation grew day by day. (To be continued)

### Gold Market Lingers

Yesterday's gold market in both the open market and the black market showed a circular trend, falling first and then rising, once rising close to the 6,500 yuan mark. People's hearts turned from tired to unstable. The American exchange rate was absorbed by British and American commercial banks, hindering the downward trend. It was not easy to break through 5.375 yuan, so securities firms and silver firms tried to sell heavily after the market opened in the morning, pushing the price back to 6,435 yuan. Soon after, they came to compete with the Qianzhuang for profit. The short positions took profits and began to buy back, and the rebound started to rise, reaching 6,495 yuan at noon. It finally rose 2 yuan against the downtrend. After the close, gold and securities firms suddenly came to sell, and the price fell again to 6,450 yuan. About 50,000 taels were traded in the morning. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The off-market price has stabilized, and the cash price has rebounded slightly. First, Defu offered 100 taels of Zhongxing, with a price 240 yuan higher than the futures price. Then, they continued to sell 200 taels, and Chiren offered 100 taels, and Fukangyong offered 80 taels, all 230 yuan higher, and Chengji bought them, which was 20 yuan less than the previous day. The prices of decorative gold and custom gold were both flat.

The Downtrend for Pure Gold is Certain

Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) continued the weak trend after the close of the previous day. The market opened 35 yuan lower at 9:15 AM, at 6,450 yuan. Then, it fluctuated rapidly. Tongkangyong and Shunyuan tried to sell heavily, so the price rose to 6,470 yuan, and then fell back to 6,448 yuan. Dafeng, Chengji, and Defu bought in, and the price rose again to 6,475 yuan. Yida, Tongkangyong, Hengji tried to sell heavily, and retail investors pressed down sharply. At 9:50 AM, the price fell to 6,435 yuan, which was pulled up by the strong buying of Dafeng, Xinfengyong, Decheng, Yifeng, Shunyuan, and Defu, who saw the low price. Foreign exchange also turned from loose to soft, and short sellers rushed to cover their positions, and the price rose sharply and fell back slightly, rising to 6,495 yuan at noon. Tianyuan tried to sell heavily, and the price fell back to 6,475 yuan. The floating shorts went in again, and at noon the market closed at 6,487 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan. According to the settlement price of 5.34375 yuan for the May US dollar, the price was 6,517 yuan, down 30 yuan. After the close of the market, Defu, Chengji, Gongda, and Hesheng sold off, and the price fell to 6,455 yuan. Yida advanced to 6,465 yuan. Finally, gold and securities firms were still selling, and the price was 6,450 yuan. The price fluctuated by 60 yuan in the morning. There was a selling household with an off-market price of 6,450 yuan in the afternoon. The selling price of gold in the gold shop was 250 yuan higher than the futures price of pure gold, and the received price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. The current price for standard gold was still unavailable.

The Exchange Rate for Decorative Gold Remains Unchanged

The selling price of decorative gold per tael in silver shops, both Datonghang and Xintonghang, remained at 695 yuan, with a 40 yuan reduction for purchases.

### Foreign Currencies Gradually Stabilize

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a clear flat and dark falling market for pure gold, so the British and American gold pounds were also down by one yuan. The price of British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price was flat. The price of American gold notes gradually stabilized, and finally fell by 4 cents, with a closing price of 18.44 yuan. Hong Kong is expected to continue to weaken. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes was still balanced, and the evening market remained at 2.07 yuan. The supply of Korean notes was strong, and the market price was weak, falling to 1.77 yuan in the evening.

### Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Are Narrow, Japanese Yarn is Cheaper, Double Horse Difficult to Rise Temporarily

The yarn market, which had fallen miserably the previous day, stabilized slightly yesterday. This is because there was naturally a possibility of stabilization after the huge drop of 100 yuan in two days. However, the actual position has no ability to rise temporarily, because there is a lack of sales. The price of 20-count miscellaneous brand yarn is low, and the trend is even more stagnant. At the same time, there is sufficient inventory. Once the double horse loosens, there are no buyers to accept it, and Japanese yarn is allowed to be sold cheaply. Therefore, in this regard, cotton yarn itself is difficult to rise temporarily. However, some bulls with sufficient economic resources are still buying in the same amount, so the market can still be supported for a while. However, most of the floating bulls have already fled. As for the buyer's discussion, the current international situation is increasingly urgent, the foreign exchange rate is rising, and the standard gold is falling. All kinds of goods have been falling recently. The obstruction of cotton yarn shipping has caused most bulls to give up. In this way, it would not be surprising to see the downside market price below 1,400 yuan. The high price for 20-count double horse was 1,486 yuan, and the low price was 1,470 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the lack of market in the weekend black market, someone said that it was done at 1,473 yuan. There will be 1,150 pieces of yarn shipped to Hong Kong tomorrow.

The Double Horse market opened in the morning due to the slightly higher closing price in the afternoon of the previous day, and people's morale stabilized slightly. The first plate price was 1,485 yuan, but there were few buyers for this plate. Because after the big drop the previous day, the general bulls were exhausted and unable to struggle, so the market situation had become scattered. Shortly after, the standard gold opened flat, and there were many sellers on the table. The situation turned weak, falling to 1,477 yuan. However, a certain party of bulls came again to pull a few bags, and returned to 1,481 yuan. After that, it circled at 1,478-1,479 yuan for a long time. Later, with a slight increase in the standard gold, it rose to 1,486 yuan. When the market closed, it weakened again to 1,471 yuan. The statistics of the turnover of 9,770 bags in the morning are listed as follows. Hong Kong 220, Same Industry 9,500, Total 9,720.

### Cotton Yarn Market Rises and Falls, Speculators Laugh and Cry: A Hidden Account of the Wild Fluctuations in Cotton Yarn Prices in April

(1) Before the Spring Holiday on April 15th, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,430 yuan. At this time, securities firms and some speculators were bearish, because the inventory of Double Horse yarn was abundant, and the factories, in order to reduce inventory, offered incentives for export, offering a subsidy of 100 yuan per bale if it was indeed shipped to other ports. As a result, "Rewards bring forth brave men." Guangdong merchants purchased a batch and shipped it to Hong Kong for storage. According to investigations, they bought as many as six or seven thousand bales successively, which naturally reduced the inventory in Shanghai. However, there was a large profit to be made in spot goods in other ports.

(2) Speculators seized the opportunity to exaggerate and became very active, spreading rumors in the market that inventory was decreasing, the supply was drying up, and due to the electricity conservation issue imposed by the Municipal Council, factories were forced to reduce production. They claimed that the market would see prices skyrocket to 1,600 or 1,700 yuan, and also said that everything else was expensive except cotton yarn. This triggered a buying frenzy, with more buying than selling for a time, making it difficult to meet the demand. The market squeezed, and prices gradually rose, reaching 1,586 yuan on May 5th. With the situation looking good, of course, people went long, absorbing more inventory.

(3) Unexpectedly, the price of Double Horse yarn was forced higher due to excessive speculation. However, when the price became too high, the foundation could not be sound. How can we see this? Looking at the reasons, although a portion of Double Horse yarn was removed by shipping it out, the goods from various factories producing miscellaneous brands of yarn were piled up like mountains. Moreover, since the military conflict in Eastern Zhejiang, transportation was obstructed, and sales plummeted. Therefore, standard yarn ran forward blindly, but miscellaneous brands of yarn were like wooden donkeys, trying to catch up and breaking their legs, creating an ever-widening gap in market prices. The discrepancy between Double Horse and similar-count yarn, which should have been 220 or 230 yuan cheaper, was astonishing. The above situation was enough to deal a fatal blow to Double Horse yarn.

(4) When the market is high, it is also exposed to the danger of attracting wind, and once it encounters a storm, the waves break apart. Moreover, everyone being long made the reaction even more drastic. Some speculators are either long or short, and their methods are relatively flexible. Unexpectedly, rumors abounded, saying that the situation in the Pacific was tense, and goods could not be shipped from Hong Kong. In addition, the exchange rate soared, and the margin deposit plummeted. Frequent bad news caused the bullish sentiment to waver, and a large number of holdings were released. Tens of thousands of bales of supply could not withstand this reversal, and as a result, the small speculators suffered, often losing their shirts.

(5) Some people also say that lately, commercial news shows everything is in decline. It is also said that the price of 42-count yarn used to soar, but now it has plummeted by 100 or 200 yuan. The price of 32-count yarn has also fallen and lacks a market. Japanese yarn of the same count is even cheaper. All sorts of arguments have once again favored the short side. However, at present, commodity prices are high, and factory costs have increased. The key to future ups and downs still depends on the level of consumption. It is better to rely on this than to rely solely on buying from A and selling to B. Such manipulations cannot consolidate the foundation. The extent of the majority's psychological pullback may be around 1,400 yuan. This year's cotton yarn market belongs to a tug-of-war, so some speculators may win, but the rest are still frowning, unable to meet their expenses. Why bother? Most big companies will profit, but the best are the small companies that skim the remaining profits and return fully loaded. How wonderful! (Jing)

### Cotton Market Cools Down

The current cotton situation is as calm as ever, so transactions are completely at a standstill. The market has been hit by the falling yarn market, and factories are helpless.

Fire-engine grass bales 194 [unclear unit], Xie Xin 130 bales delivered to the warehouse.

Another dispatch: Shanghai's foreign cotton trade has been affected by the weakness of the yarn market, the rising exchange rate, and the instability of the international situation. All parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Factories have no appetite, and colleagues have not engaged in purchases. However, the cotton market is slightly different from the yarn market. The price of American cotton is quite high, and the inventory in Shanghai is not large. Therefore, if the situation improves, the cotton market still has hope of remaining strong.

The New York cotton market is seeing enthusiastic buying due to Washington political news favoring the bulls and good cotton cloth trade conditions. The market is constantly active and firm as a result. Yesterday's closing price was 25-26 points higher than the previous day.

Another telegram: American cotton statistics from August 1st last year to May 9th this year are recorded on the left (per 500-pound bale):

Cumulative Listing: 10,668,000 bales

Cumulative Factory Use: 8,051,000 bales

Cumulative Exports: 910,000 bales

To Japan: 96,000 bales

To China: 60,200 bales

To England: 56,000 bales

To Germany: 139,000 bales

Port City Inventory: 6,093,000 bales

The Indian cotton market is relatively flat, with closing prices mixed, rising or falling by 1-2 rupees. A forecast of today's opening market situation is given, with prices expected to be higher by more than a few rupees because of the strong rise in American cotton.

Also, Indian cotton is being transshipped to Shanghai via Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's ship "Fu Sheng" arrived from Hong Kong with 3,921 pieces of Indian cotton, docking at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Seems to Turn Stronger

—Two Foreign Firms Distribute Dividends—

The over-the-counter market for government bonds showed a slight improvement yesterday. There were rumors in the market of peace talks, but knowledgeable people did not find them credible. Market prices were generally raised by small retail investors buying in at two or three jiao above previous prices. Category A bonds still did not trade, and confidence remained weak. Local retail investors buying in did little to affect the overall market. Yesterday was Saturday, and there was only one trading session in the morning. Tong Kang and Shun Chang bought slightly, but most of the buying came from individual retail investors buying 5,000 to 10,000 [unclear unit]. Lianhe and Hongda both sold off. Category C bonds rose by four jiao, but still could not be pulled up. In the end, except for Category A bonds, which did not trade, the rest were slightly better by two or three jiao. The total turnover was about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

In stock transactions, 100 shares of a trust company were traded at a price of 15 yuan and 2 jiao and a half.

Shanghai Enterprises, Ltd., a British company, is scheduled to distribute an interim dividend for 1941 of 1.25 yuan per share in national currency on May 26th. It is also learned that the company's board of directors has resolved to announce its self-liquidation and will convene an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders in the near future to discuss the liquidation matters.

Crawford & Co., Ltd., managed by the British firm Gibb, Livingston & Co., is scheduled to convene its 31st annual general meeting on June 3rd. The company's net profit for 1940 totaled more than 910,000 yuan in national currency. In addition to the interim dividend of 2 jiao and 5 fen per share that has already been distributed, it is proposed to pay a final dividend of 1 jiao and 5 fen, for a total of 4 jiao for the whole year.

### Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth is Weak and the Situation Has Not Improved

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market continued to be weak due to weak sentiment. All parties are inclined to wait and see, and buyers are even more scarce. Retail investors are cutting out small amounts of goods, and transaction prices continue to decline. However, factory prices are not loosening, and the overall market remains relatively stable. As a result, white goods and fine cloth fell by 2 jiao and a half, coarse cloth and twill fell by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half, and bleached and dyed cloth fell by 3 to 5 jiao. Over 200 pieces of cloth were traded on the street. Zhejiang and Fujian merchants handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and coarse cloth. Merchants from Kwangtung and Nanyang handled more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and twill. On the 11th, 1,495 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.

Eastern Cloth: The spot market is still closed, so there is no official market. However, for the over-the-counter market for Dragon Head Fine Cloth, it was said that it first traded at 49 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. Afterwards, because the exchange standard continued to soften, it fell to 49 yuan and 4 jiao. Yih Wo made a transaction. Four Gentlemen Serge was offered for sale at 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen and a half per yard.

### Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Looser

Yesterday, the sugar market did not fluctuate much, with only a few jiao in price changes. The guild's market price for spot goods of 24 groups of white sugar from the Outer Warehouse was 114 yuan. May 20th futures for coarse first were 115 yuan, 4 jiao, 8 jiao, 5 jiao, and 3 jiao, later tightening slightly to 115 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 jiao, 9 jiao, 7 jiao, and 8 jiao, small 4 jiao. Trading in the end-of-May futures has also begun, opening at only 114 yuan and 7 jiao, then rising to 15 yuan, 8 jiao, 7 jiao, 9 jiao, and 8 jiao and a half, and even to 16 yuan. Dutch Red was 88 yuan to 88 yuan and a half, small 5 jiao. Taikoo Granulated White B Mark East Warehouse was 116 yuan and 2 jiao to 16 yuan, West Warehouse was 116 yuan and a half. DY Mark East Warehouse was 105 yuan, 5 yuan and a half, and 6 yuan. HX Mark was 103 yuan and a half to 3 yuan and 2 jiao. Also, 10,000 bags of sugar are being shipped to Tianjin today.

### Coal: Huainan Coal Has a Wide Source

Huainan bituminous coal has been sluggish lately due to its wide source. The coal contains a lot of stone, so it is not favored by users and can only be mixed with high-quality goods for use. Therefore, after rising, the price has fallen back. Yesterday, the industry association opened for pricing. Huainan general coal was 310 yuan per ton, screened lumps were 330 yuan, and coal dust was 290 yuan. Ex-warehouse, delivery by own cart. Cartage costs are additional.

### Hardware: Transactions are Sluggish

Recently, the hardware market has been quiet due to the impact of the ban on the export of iron products, and the business of foreign merchants has been inactive, resulting in extreme leisure. Although local purchases have not stopped, transactions are sporadic, so the market atmosphere is abnormal, and people are also tired. The asking prices for various goods are fluctuating. The trends of various goods are briefly described below:

New Coil: Coil, also known as wire rod, is the raw material for manufacturing local nails. However, it is also used for other purposes, such as in the construction industry and by screw factories. However, because its asking price is expensive, transactions are not very active. Wholesale transactions, in particular, are few. The local nail factories, seeing that the sales of their finished products are not smooth and the market is weak, do not dare to purchase large quantities of raw materials, resulting in sporadic transactions. The standard market price yesterday was about 230 yuan per picul.

Local Wire Nails: The trade in local factory wire nails is exceptionally sparse due to the lack of interest from foreign merchants, resulting in an unusually small amount of export goods. Moreover, local speculators occasionally sell off, resulting in an oversupply of goods in circulation. Supply exceeds demand in the market, and standard prices have fallen. Compared to the price of new coil, the disparity is significant. Yesterday, the price of a barrel of Bessemer nails was only 185 yuan.

### Douner Returns to Shanghai After Traveling in the Interior: Praises China's Rapid Progress, Development of Various Convenient and Effective Transportation, Construction of New Buildings in the Capital and Improved Air Defense

Appropriate Development of Various Industries Including Pharmaceuticals

Mr. Douner of the National Association of the Young Men's Christian Associations of China, recently arrived in Shanghai after completing a four-month tour in the interior. He told reporters the day before yesterday (the 9th) that convenient and effective transportation in the interior connects Free China and forms a strong and united country. He was deeply impressed by this. There are many types of transportation tools and methods, such as porters, pack horses, wheelbarrows, handcarts, motorcars, and airplanes. The transportation authorities are determined to develop the transportation system, and all officials are firmly committed to continuing their efforts.

Chongqing's Air Defense Equipment is Perfect

Regarding Chongqing, Mr. Douner stated that its air defense is unparalleled in the world, especially its air-raid shelters, which are well-equipped, many of which have running water, electricity, and wooden floors. The air-raid shelter of the Propaganda Committee is particularly well-equipped, and broadcasts can continue as usual even during air raids. Although the capital has suffered heavy damage, many temporary and permanent buildings are being constructed, such as the New Life Center, where buildings have already been completed or will be completed soon. There are also convalescent homes for wounded soldiers, sanatoriums, restaurants, and outdoor lecture halls.

The YMCA Has Already Rebuilt Its New Building

The main building of the Chongqing YMCA has been destroyed, but the dormitory has been repaired. The YMCA has recently raised 100,000 yuan to build a new building. President Chiang Kai-shek and his wife generously donated 10,000 yuan and sent a letter congratulating the YMCA on its good work in the capital. In addition to raising 100,000 yuan, the YMCA sold its old building for 120,000 yuan, totaling 220,000 yuan, to build a new building in Chongqing. The YMCA has an agency in the suburbs to assist the villagers, and its air-raid shelter can accommodate 3,000 people, with bamboo pipes to regulate the air.

Almost All Areas of the Southwest and Northwest Have Been Visited

Mr. Douner also said that he started from Qingdao to Kaifeng, rode a handcart over the sandy land to the frequently changing Yellow River ferry, then stopped in Zhengzhou, took a train to Tongguan in Luoyang, walked through the pass in a sandstorm, and then took a train through Xi'an to the terminal Baoji, transferred to a postal truck, passed through Chengdu and arrived in Chongqing after 24 hours, flew to Kunming, and then took a truck to the halfway point between Guiyang and Guilin, changed to a train, and then took the road through Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, and finally arrived in Hong Kong.

Local Industries Are Developing Rapidly

Mr. Douner also expressed his admiration for the Chinese government's efforts to meet medical needs, and praised the work of the National Epidemic Prevention Bureau and the Chinese Red Cross Society. It is said that the two agencies assist in experiments to manufacture vaccines and other medicines. The people running these experiments are students who have studied at American medical schools. The use of domestic products in the interior is increasing, and local industries such as mining and smelting are developing rapidly. Electrical equipment, 40-50 horsepower motors, and wireless machines can all be manufactured domestically. Due to the war, the masses have moved inland on a large scale. The three YMCA locations in Changsha, Nanchang, and Guangzhou have been forced to move to new locations, but have established a foothold in less than two years, with members reaching two to three thousand people.

### Jin Huating: Memorial Service Tomorrow

Many Friends from All Over Send Condolences. After the Reporter of Shen Bao, Jin Huating, Was Murdered, His Coffin Was Temporarily Placed in the Mainland Funeral Parlor. Tomorrow is the 100th day since his passing. The funeral arrangement at the Jin residence has been decided to be held at Huguo Temple on Mendelland Road to receive condolences. Mr. Jin had a wide range of social connections during his lifetime, and at that time, simple funeral carts and white horses, ought to be extremely mournful. It is said that recently, many friends from all over the world have sent letters and telegrams of condolence.

### The President Taft Leaves Shanghai

The President Taft, a regular mail ship of the American President Lines, left Shanghai yesterday morning at 8 o'clock after arriving in Shanghai from the United States on the 8th, mooring at the eleventh and twelfth floating docks in the Huangpu River. It is scheduled to return to Shanghai around the 20th of this month to pick up overseas Chinese and return them to the United States.

### Hong Kong Rice is Scheduled to Arrive Today: Food for the People is Guaranteed, The French Municipal Council Begins Rice Registration, Decides the Selling Price Will Not Exceed 100 Yuan

The Times reported that the French Municipal Council had a meeting with rice merchants a few days ago to discuss the formation of a committee organized by rice merchants, which would be discussed by the rice merchants and controlled by the Council. A spokesman for the Council announced the day before yesterday that the price of the first batch of Saigon rice to be transported would definitely not exceed 100 yuan per shi. During the discussion on Thursday night, the rice merchants indicated to the French Concession authorities that they were determined to cooperate thoroughly with the authorities. According to the authorities, anyone who wants to purchase this rice can register with the committee, and the committee will forward the order to the French Municipal Council to facilitate purchases from Annam. In the future, the committee will be responsible for distributing the rice to various sections under the direction of the French authorities. This plan is completely the same as in the Public Concession. As for the first batch of Hong Kong rice, although it will be sold at a price of 110 yuan, the number of Hong Kong rice shipments that will arrive later is expected to be lower than this price.

Rice Weevils Make a Last Struggle Yesterday

Rice prices have plummeted by more than ten yuan in recent days. However, ordinary rice weevils are still making their last struggle, causing rice prices to be slightly raised again yesterday after a sharp drop. After the rice market opened yesterday, large hoarders, hearing that Hong Kong rice would definitely arrive in Shanghai today, believed that prices would continue to fall and that the huge amount of rice they had hoarded would not be able to be released, so they created absurd rumors to confuse the market. As a result, the prices of rice at various stalls were raised by several yuan. Later, it was learned that the Hong Kong government's food rice control measures were designed to prevent hoarding and speculation, and that rice ordered by Shanghai would be supplied as usual, so rice prices fell back in the afternoon market, eventually being illegally raised by three or four yuan.

Afternoon Trading is Still Active

The afternoon trading of the Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association was proposed by the supervisory meeting of the association in October last year, and the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee decided to ban it, but soon the old habits recurred and it was revived. Because the current rice market transactions are all manipulated by speculators, the trading hours have been extended to give them more opportunities to operate. As a result, the rice price was raised by this kind of afternoon trading, so all parties hope that the on-site investigators and the responsible persons of the association should quickly investigate secretly and severely crack down on it in order to stabilize the rice market.

The First Batch of Hong Kong Rice Arrives Today

The first batch of 5,000 tons of Hong Kong rice purchased by the Public Concession Bureau is expected to arrive in Shanghai today due to weather reasons. The first carriers are the Hanyang, a ship of the British firm Butterfield & Swire, and the Mingsheng, a ship of the British firm Jardine Matheson. The Lijī firm, which is responsible for selling this batch of Hong Kong rice, carried out various loading and purchasing procedures yesterday. As for the rice shops, grocery stores, and rice vendors that are selling the rice, they will generally start picking up and selling the goods tomorrow because today is Sunday.

Rice Stock Found: 2 Million Bags

The current rice stock in this city has reached its most abundant period, and there is no fear of shortage in the future. According to the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, the current rice stock is as follows, totaling 1,116,972 bags, an increase of 62,761 bags compared with the previous period: (1) Bank of China Warehouse: 47.63 bags; (2) Siming Bank Warehouse: 11.616 bags; (3) Zhejiang Xingye Bank: 59.167 bags; (4) China Industrial: 19.907 bags; (5) Jincheng Bank Warehouse: 16.354 bags; (6) Xinhua Bank Warehouse: 12.674 bags; (7) Donglai Bank Warehouse: 15.633 bags; (8) Jinyuan: 16.695 bags; (9) Zikang: 10.349 bags; (10) Guotai: 12.384 bags; (11) Maotai: 55.196 bags; (12) Hufeng: 14.584 bags; (13) Dinghe: 18.460 bags; (14) Roosevelt: 123.237 bags; (15) Taikoo: 74.587 bags; (16) Old Taikoo: 18.933 bags; (17) Qichang/Small Jardine Matheson: 76.334 bags; (18) Huashun: 33.212 bags; (19) Gonghexiang/Shuntai: 131.136 bags; (20) Company Warehouse: 82.124 bags; (21) Longmao: 136.175 bags. As for the retail sales of rice at various rice shops and the purchases of 4 million citizens, it is estimated that there are also more than 700,000 bags. Including the rice in the strong warehouses, the total rice stock in this city has reached about 1 million bags. The Bean and Rice Association has sent reports to the authorities of the two concessions and various rice industry organizations for their reference.

Rice Delivery Workers Take a Tough Stance

Workers who transport rice by cart oppose the rice shops entrusting the transport of rice to trucks, cutting off the livelihoods of thousands of workers, and have requested that the original situation be maintained and that the transport of rice continue to be entrusted to workers in this industry. There has been no reply so far. The workers are panicked and petitioned the Municipal Council for relief the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Rice Shop Association, limiting them to a specific reply before the 12th. Otherwise, the Rice Shop Association will be responsible for any accidents that occur. The authorities are paying close attention to whether there are any other circumstances involved.

### Provisional Municipal Council Will Meet Again Next Week to Study the Reports of Former Committees, a Decision Will Be Made on Utility Price Increases

It was learned yesterday that the Provisional Municipal Council will hold its first regular meeting next Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. to study the reports of the former committees of the Bureau. In addition, at least three of the new committees of the Municipal Council are expected to meet next week. The most important of these is the meeting of the Public Utilities Committee, as it will decide whether to allow the various public utility companies to increase their prices. It is said that the four major public utility companies in the Public Concession have all applied to the Municipal Council for permission to increase their prices. The detailed content of the application is not yet known, but it is said that the bus and tram companies plan to double their fares. In their application to the Municipal Council, they stated that they would welcome any "substantial" increase that could be implemented. The other two companies that are expected to apply for fee increases are the water and electricity companies. It is not yet known how much they plan to increase their fees.

### More Than 100 Sampans in the Suzhou Creek Were Sunk by the Japanese Yesterday, More Than 700 People Were Immediately Displaced, Some Larger Vessels Were Confiscated for Their Own Use

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that there are many sampans and small boats moored in the Suzhou Creek near McKenna Road, densely packed together. The boat people live on the water and live a poor life. But this morning (the 10th), a number of Japanese naval marines went to the area, drove about 700 boat people ashore, and then scuttled the boats, causing them to sink. The boat people stood on the shore in the rain, watching their boats and belongings sink to the bottom of the river.

Japanese Soldiers Attacked, Causing a Dispute

The incident stemmed from the fact that a Japanese sentry in the area was shot at a couple of weeks ago. Japanese troops, together with the Water Police Station, searched the small boats next to McKenna Road in order to arrest the murderer. It was said that two suspects were arrested at the time. After the Japanese soldiers finished searching, they scuttled the small boats one by one, regardless of right or wrong. It was found that on Sunday night, two Japanese sentries stationed in front of a certain bakery in the area were attacked. The murderers fired from a sampan boat in the Suzhou Creek, and then tried to land ashore, fleeing into the Public Concession and being captured.

Holes Drilled in the Bottom of the Boat, Allowed to Sink

The method of destruction used by the Japanese soldiers this morning was quite simple, that is, they drove all the bewildered boat people ashore, searched the boats, drilled holes in the bottom of the boats, and allowed the water to enter and sink the boats. The boat people had no choice but to take the reeds from the boats and build sheds along the shore to avoid the wind and rain. The reporter arrived at the area to investigate and saw a very tragic scene. At that time, the boat people were cooking lunch on the spot. Some of the belongings on the boats had been taken out and scattered on the ground in a mess. Some boat people were still wading knee-deep in the muddy water, retrieving useful items from the sinking boats.

Larger Vessels Have Been Confiscated

The purpose of this move by the Japanese soldiers is to clear the small boats in the Suzhou Creek to prevent Japanese sentries in the area from being shot at again by people hiding in the boats. More than 100 boats were scuttled. It is said that some larger vessels were confiscated by the Japanese soldiers for their own use. At that time, there were many bystanders on the shore. US Marines and Public Concession police arrived at the scene to disperse the idlers. Before long, the US soldiers left, leaving the Western police at the scene to maintain order.

Serious Steps After the Blockade

The Japanese authorities have not made any comments on the scuttling of the boats today. It is generally believed that this is the most serious step taken by the Japanese side since the blockade of Yu Yuan Road from November 26th to December 18th last year. It is said that the Public Concession Police Department also intends to clear the boats in the McKenna Road area and prohibit them from mooring there for a long time. It is also rumored that after the Japanese sentry was shot on Sunday, more than 1,000 boat people in the area were taken to the Japanese military headquarters for questioning.

### Silver and Coin Industry Consumer Cooperative Seeks Exercise Awards

The Consumer Cooperative organized by the silver and coin industry colleagues in this city was established in May of the 28th year of the Republic of China and has now been in operation for two years. It has 3,000 members, its business is flourishing, and it is deeply appreciated by those in the industry. It is learned that the fourth round of recruitment of new shareholders has ended. Therefore, from today (the 11th) to the 18th, a welcome sale for new shareholders will be held for eight days to promote the interest of new shareholders in the cooperative business. A small exercise award ceremony is scheduled to be held this morning, and the president, Mr. Zhou Desun, will personally present the awards. All shareholders and people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about the cooperative business are welcome to visit.

### Seven Ships Detained in Zhoushan

Before the outbreak of the war in eastern Zhejiang, foreign ships sailing between Shanghai and Zhejiang were detained by Japanese warships in the waters off Zhoushan. It has been several months, and they have not been released. According to the shipping industry yesterday, the number of ships detained in Zhoushan has now increased to seven. Several months ago, the ships that sailed from various ports in Zhejiang to Shanghai and were detained were the "Moufu," "Changde," "Jiangsu," "Anmanli," and "Aweimali." With this increase to seven, the other two ships should be newly arrived. However, the names of these two ships are not yet known. It is speculated that they may be the "Minhe" of the Portuguese merchants and the "Datong" of the British merchants, which were left at the Oujiang pier. It is likely that these two ships had not yet set sail when the war broke out, or they had to sail there afterwards. Although the various shipping companies have petitioned the consulate to negotiate for the release of the ships, the Japanese side has not responded, resulting in a standstill. In Wenzhou, although Ouhai has officially resumed operations, shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou cannot be resumed temporarily. The resumption of the "Shunli" wheel on the Shanghai-Ningbo line is purely speculative business and is unreliable. It is now heard that China, Huazhong, and Dongya are competing for the Shanghai-Ningbo line. It is also learned that the "Deping" wheel of the Zhongyi Company (which previously operated on the Shanghai-Ningbo line) has recently been leased by the Japanese Yamashita Steamship Company, but its intention is unknown.

### Western Newspaper Discusses Japanese Newspaper's Views: Insufficient Understanding of China; If Japan Wants to Continue Stationing Troops in China, It Cannot Eliminate the Cause of Friction

The semi-official "Japan Times" and "Guangzhi Bao" advocated seeking peace with China in their editorials on the 9th. The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" commented on this yesterday, saying that the Japanese are "the greatest artists" in the world, and that their contributions have created a new era.

Insufficient Understanding of China by Japan

When the newspaper generally discussed the Sino-Japanese War, it stated that Japan could not conquer China by force and advocated resolving the incident peacefully. However, the only ceasefire method suggested by the newspaper was to allow Japan to continue stationing troops in China. We believe that if this method can contribute to peace, we are willing to provide free meals to anyone after peace arrives. Although the newspaper has a correct understanding, it lacks a correct solution.

No Withdrawal, No Solution

The newspaper stated that there are two ways to resolve the war: one is to eliminate the cause of friction, and the other is to establish an environment sufficient to guarantee an orderly life. However, the fact that Japanese troops can continue to stay in China is sufficient to prolong the war and increase friction. Today, it is Japan, not China, that is seeking peace. China will not make peace until all Japanese troops have withdrawn.

Refusing to Treat the Disease Leads to Failure

The more Japan needs peace, the only way is to make peace with Chongqing, but the Japanese are reluctant to say it. This is the reason why Japan has failed and cannot announce it to its own country. The actions of the Japanese army in China over the past four years are well documented. Therefore, Japan cannot now make Chongqing trust its promise to withdraw its troops and respect China's sovereignty.

China Determined to Continue Fighting

At a time when the international environment is improving, allowing China to fully believe in its great future, China is unlikely to engage in any peace negotiations. The long-term war of four years has shown that China can be self-reliant. Therefore, the wave of peace painted by Japanese artists cannot stop China from fighting. Although Japan is eager for peace, peace cannot be promoted by Japan's wishes, and the right to propose peace terms lies in China, not Japan.

### Judge Yu Shuwei Kidnapped and Missing

After Ms. Zhou Jingcai, a female clerk of the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court of Shanghai, Jiangsu, was kidnapped last Thursday, it was rumored that she had been released. Now, a similar incident has occurred. Yu Shuwei, a native of Changshu and former clerk of the Anhui Higher Court, is the nephew of Yu Chengxiu, a former judge of the Civil Court of the First Special Court and now a lawyer. Since the fall of Anhui Province, he was ordered by the Ministry of Justice to be assigned to the First Special Court and was assigned to work in the Criminal Court, where he was assigned to the Criminal Court judge to hold court once a week. His home is located somewhere on a road built beyond the boundary. Following Zhou Jingcai, he was also kidnapped, and there has been no news of him so far.

### Leadership Visits the New Chairman of the Public Works Department

At 10:30 a.m. on the 9th of this month, Consul General Hill formally visited Mr. Liddell, the new Chairman of the Public Works Department. Also, Rear Admiral Hiraoka Taichi, the commander of the Japanese Navy's Shanghai base, visited the Chairman of the Public Works Department yesterday (the 10th) morning.

### Miller Transportation Labor Dispute: Workers Beaten and Injured

Prolonged Business Labor Dispute

The Shanghai Commercial Press Staff Association has been on a hunger strike since the 23rd of last month. The company has suspended business and has been closed for nearly two weeks. During this long period, although various parties have mediated and the head office has sent special commissioners to Shanghai to handle the matter, no progress has been made. The labor and management sides are still deadlocked. After Mr. Li Bojia, the representative of the management, came to Shanghai, he once talked with the labor side, but did not continue negotiations afterwards. In order to break the deadlock, the labor side specially convened a meeting of the entire executive and supervisory committee yesterday.

Color Printing Labor Dispute Mediation

More than a thousand workers in the color printing industry in this city suddenly went on strike at 10:00 a.m. two days ago (the 9th). No specific conditions were put forward in advance, only a request to improve treatment. It is learned that this matter is being mediated by the Color Printing Industry Association.

Washing and Dyeing Labor-Management Negotiations

After repeated concessions in the strike of more than 3,000 washing and ironing workers in the Western-style washing and dyeing industry, the labor side resumed work in the morning of the day before yesterday. The labor and management sides held preliminary negotiations yesterday afternoon, but failed to reach an agreement due to the excessive demands made by the labor side. Therefore, it is scheduled to hold another round of negotiations this afternoon. It is expected that a satisfactory solution can be reached after today's negotiations.

Miller Workers Clash

All the drivers and workers of the Miller Automobile Transportation Company at No. 106 Beijing Road jointly submitted requests to the management on the 19th of last month, requesting an increase in wages and living allowances. The management refused, and the labor side announced a strike on the morning of the 29th. Unexpectedly, on the 6th of this month, all the striking workers clashed with the company authorities on the Taopeng Road when they hired replacement workers to load and transport goods from the British-American Tobacco Company. Six workers were injured on the spot. It is learned that the Political Department of the Public Concession, in view of the deadlock in the labor dispute and fearing that it would cause unexpected incidents, has been working hard to mediate between the two sides in the past two days. It is expected that a satisfactory solution can be reached in the short term.

Yiyou Society Injects Vaccine

It is summer, the season when epidemics are most easily transmitted. Therefore, the health authorities of the two concessions are actively promoting epidemic prevention movements and providing free vaccinations to citizens in order to reduce disease and death. In order to prevent epidemics before they occur, the Yiyou Society in this city has formulated prevention measures by the Health Section of the Welfare Committee and sent them to all sectors: (1) Those who want to be vaccinated can send a letter to inform the number of people, address, and time so that staff can be sent to carry out the vaccination; (2) Those who go to the Society for vaccination must do so between 8:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. and must make an appointment in advance to avoid crowding. Vaccination is free of charge. The permit issued after vaccination can be exchanged for a certificate of vaccination from the Health Department of the Public Works Department.

The Wine and Dish Industry Association has also decided to hold a meeting before the deadline to discuss supervision methods.

Li Zhou could not bear to disobey her beloved son, so she rushed to the rooftop terrace and leaned against the railing to call Yang Zhou. Unexpectedly, because Li Zhou was tall and burly, she leaned her upper body down to call someone, and she lost her balance and fell headfirst from the railing to the cement floor. Her head was broken, and her brain was injured. She fainted immediately. After being discovered, an ambulance was called and sent to Guangci Hospital. It was too late to save her, and she died.

In Close Pursuit

Passing Baike Road to the entrance of the Jinmen Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, he saw Chinese policeman No. 246 stationed there. He immediately stepped forward to report, and the policeman chased after them. At this time, the two robbers on the streetcar had also received the news and abandoned the car to escape into the crowd. When the policeman saw the fleeing men, he knew they were not good people, so he

Everyone was awakened from their sleep and threatened by a gun. He took out two pairs of handcuffs to prevent any noise and began to rob. After an hour, he robbed 1,000 yuan, a large bag of gold and silver jewelry worth thousands of yuan. As he was about to escape from the back door with the loot, he was reported to Chinese policeman No. 3236 stationed nearby.

### A Glimpse of the Book Market

— Jiang Ping

When I have nothing to do, I often like to go to the bookstores in the area of ​​Simmalu and Henan Road to take a stroll. At first, I didn’t want to buy any books. Looking at the colorful books on the bookshelves, I felt a little more comfortable in my heart. It's just like how I like to go to the park for a walk. Even if I found a book I loved in a book stall, looking at the price on the copyright page and touching my pocket, I couldn't help but blush because of my poverty. The price of everything is rising sharply, and the price of books is also rising. Although there are many people standing by the book stalls flipping through books, very few people actually pay for the books and take them home. Therefore, I think the business of booksellers must be quite miserable!

The prices of rice, coal, and everything else are rising wildly with the revolutionary bottom of May. The printing industry is also afraid of falling behind and raising prices accordingly. The price for each thousand characters of typesetting is three yuan and seven cents (additional charges for side dots and personal name lines). The price for each ream of printing is ten yuan upon export. The price of binding has increased by 120%. In addition to the cost of paper, etc., how much does it cost to print a book? Adding the bookstore's rent, electricity, staff salaries, and other expenses, as well as the interest and profits that should be earned, I'm afraid that even a thin book of 100 pages would not make any money if it were sold for two yuan at current prices. Hunger is a major issue, and food is essential. Although the spiritual food of books is important, it can still be managed. It is not necessary to buy it unless it is needed. Therefore, I think the fate of booksellers is something that profiteers who hoard rice and coal cannot imagine.

Despite such difficult material conditions, the various types of books in bookstores are still being published continuously. What kind of tutorials, readers, literary societies, publishing houses... are still producing and publishing in large quantities. I really admire their courage, and at the same time I can't help but wonder if these books will sell well. Moreover, the content of these books is also worth examining. There are indeed many that are pure in thought and accurate in argument, but how many are crudely made and deceive readers? There are also many periodicals with childish and empty content, and I can't help but say that they are simply a waste!

There is also a type of book in bookstores that seems to be attracting attention recently. That is, after importing "How to Be a Leader," "How to Train Yourself," and "Education for Living" from the utilitarian United States, Chinese publishing houses have massively imitated and produced them, all in the role of teachers, guiding and teaching young people. I am really surprised why Chinese writers like to teach young people in this way, as if young people cannot be saved without reading these books. I also doubt that Chinese young people would really be so willing to accept other people's "lessons." I once saw a letter from a young man to an author saying: "You said that the solution is next to you, as long as you pay attention to find it, it is not difficult to find. But I looked and looked and still couldn't find it. Please tell me where is the solution?" (The general idea is like this, I can't remember the original sentence.) This sentence is humorous enough to represent the feelings of young people after reading these "teaching" books.

In terms of translation, there are several books worth mentioning. These are Fu Donghua's translation of "Gone with the Wind" (also known as "Gone with the Wind"), Lin Yutang's two English works "The Art of Living" and "Moment in Peking" (some translate it as "Peking Smoke and Clouds"), and the translation of Evelyn Waugh's "Scoop". They have all been published one after another. Especially Fu Donghua's translation of "Gone with the Wind," a huge book of more than one million words, the translator declared that he would no longer translate books after translating "Don Quixote," but finally broke the rule and completed this masterpiece. I also spent 5 yuan of legal tender to buy this "masterpiece". My motivation for buying this masterpiece can be divided into three points: (1) It was a bestseller in the United States last year and caused a sensation in the reading circles of various countries; (2) The film adapted from this masterpiece was shown in the Shanghai Renhua Theater for a long time; (3) It was translated by Fu Donghua; for this reason, I bought it despite the pain. But I haven't finished reading it yet. I don't know if it's because I don't know how to read books, or because the story of the Civil War makes me tired? Or both reasons? But I do not deny that this book aroused my bad impression: (1) The vulgar adjectives in the conversations between Brett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara; (2) Some place names in the United States already have long-standing translations in our country, but they are translated in strange and peculiar ways in this book; I suspect that this book may not have been translated by Fu Donghua, or there may be other reasons that I, with my limited knowledge, do not know. Furthermore, I don't really like this translation.

I discovered a hardcover four-volume collection of all the lecture notes from the former Shen Bao Correspondence School of Journalism in the "American Bookstore". When I asked about the price, it was 60 yuan. After investigation, it was found that many of the original lecture notes were lost, and they were reprinted and supplemented to make it perfect. However, there are only ten copies in total, which can be said to be out of print. This newspaper originally wanted to preserve all the lecture notes. A colleague, with the consent of the museum, invested in reprinting and matching them so that they could be circulated. It should be a very valuable new collection of learning!

The price of old books in the street book stalls has also soared with the price of various goods. The reading community has been severely hit. In bookstores, there are only many people flipping through books, and only one out of ten are really buying books. Under these circumstances, the old book stalls on the street have emerged in response, and they are indeed economical book markets. Therefore, the real customers of bookstores are going to the old book stalls. (Photo by Kang Zuyi)

### Famous People Who Grew Up in Poverty

— Gong Huai

——As long as you have ambition, don't be afraid of humble origins——

If a person has ambition and is willing to work hard, one day he will achieve his goal. Maybe he will become a famous person and be known all over the world. In the world, there are many famous people who have very humble origins and have lived in poverty since childhood. As a result, through continuous struggle, they have established great careers or made great contributions to mankind!

Speaking of politicians: Former US President Hoover and current Prime Minister Mussolini's fathers were poor blacksmiths; Soviet leader Stalin's father was a shoemaker, German leader Hitler was a poor orphan when he was a child, and worked as a garbage porter when he was a teenager; Our national father Sun Yat-sen, Czech President Benes, and French President Lebrun were all from peasant families. Speaking of writers: British writer Shaw worked in London as a store clerk copying invoices and keeping accounts; Soviet "giant of an era" Gorky worked as an apprentice in a mounting shop, a shop assistant in a shoe store, a gardener, a cook, and a peddler selling icons and bread; Norwegian novelist Hamsun worked as a road worker and streetcar driver. Speaking of entrepreneurs: American oil tycoon Rockefeller worked as a clerk; Automobile King Henry Ford entered a machine factory as an apprentice at the age of seventeen. Others include French general Joffre, whose father was a cooper; American inventor Edison worked as a railway worker and news vendor at the age of twelve, and did not even have food to eat at the age of twenty-one on the streets of New York. But what about their achievements?

Children, most of your current circumstances are better than those famous people were when they were young. If you don't work hard, wouldn't you be ashamed? Therefore, in this world, a person is not afraid of poverty or humble origins, but only of not being able to endure!

### The Spirit of "Starting and Finishing Well" is Needed in Doing Things

— Kang

Little friends! Whatever we do, we should set a purpose and identify a goal to work towards. Don't be fickle and indecisive. In the end, we won't be able to accomplish anything. This is the most undesirable thing. Especially for you, little friends, who are the future pillars of the country and the cornerstones of society, this kind of habit is even more unacceptable. Otherwise, you will definitely not be able to achieve great things in the future.

Yesterday, I read an English book and saw an article called "Ten Footprints." This article can serve as an example for us, so I specifically translated and wrote it down below:

"Once upon a time, there were two Native American Indians. One was named Hazida, a magical archer, strong and agile. The other was named Quetong, a weaker archer with a very weak bow. However, he was very persevering and patient. They went hunting together.

When they passed a small hill, they saw the footprints of a young deer that had recently passed by on the ground. Quetong wanted to follow the footprints to chase the deer. However, Hazida said, "You go ahead and chase it! A strong hunter like me wants to catch bigger game."

So, they went their separate ways to find their own prey!

Hazida walked for more than an hour and found ten pairs of large elk footprints running in various directions. He chose the largest footprint and followed it. He chased it for a long time, but couldn't catch up. Then he thought about chasing another one.

So, he returned to the place where he first saw the ten footprints and followed another elk footprint to chase it. After an hour, he still couldn't catch it. So, he followed another footprint to chase another one. He said, "I must catch it for food." However, after chasing it for a while, he gave up again and went to catch another one that he thought had a good chance of catching. Like this, he spent a whole day, searching one by one according to the ten footprints, but in the end, he gained nothing.

However, Quetong's insight was higher than Hazida's, and he also had a stronger patience. So, he closely followed the footprints of the young deer that he had initially seen and chased it, and in the end, he caught the deer.

The lesson this story teaches us is that we must be focused and consistent in doing things, and we must finish what we start. We must never be indecisive, like Hazida, who was busy all day but couldn't catch any wild animals, and wasted precious time in vain.

Little friends, is this worthwhile?

### Plant Toys

— Shepherd Boy

――Soybean Monkey――

Little friends, when you see this topic, you must ask me: "Soybeans can only be eaten, how can they be made into monkeys?" However, I am not lying. It can indeed be made into a monkey. Next, I will tell you how to make it, but first, please think about how to do it. Perhaps what you think of is much better than what we say.

Now, I assume you have already thought about it. I have to tell you my method to see if it is the same as what you thought. The materials for making a monkey, in addition to four soybeans, also include three short bamboo skewers and one long bamboo skewer; however, these soybeans must be newly picked from the garden. (Why?)

Let's talk about the monkey's head first! Peel off the top half of the skin of one soybean, leaving the bottom half of the skin. After you peel off the skin, you will definitely find a small bud tip; ah, isn't that the monkey's nose? So, at this time, you can know what the remaining skin is for. It's just like the monkey wearing a hat.

Next, we need to talk about the monkey's waist, but we can know that the waist is simple, just replace it with a soybean.

What we need to talk about are the monkey's hands and feet. Don't we still have two soybeans left? This is the solution. Please peel off the skin of the soybeans, and then please peel off a small part of the inside of each soybean, wouldn't it look very much like curved hands and feet?

All parts of the monkey are made. We only need to use bamboo skewers to connect the monkey's head and waist. A small bamboo skewer connects the monkey's back and hands, and another small bamboo skewer connects the monkey's waist and feet. The remaining long bamboo skewer is useless; just insert it into the monkey's butt! At this time, you can lift the monkey up and play with it.

### Science and Superstition

— Yangchun Green

In the past, people's knowledge was naive, and they thought that all things in nature were governed by gods. Mountains had mountain gods, water had water gods, fire had fire gods, wind had wind gods, and even old trees had tree gods. Later, after scientists' detailed observations and precise experiments, this superstition was broken.

Summer thunderstorms aroused people's doubts. Some people said, "The Thunder God Bodhisattva has come out, the Lightning Goddess has appeared." Others said, "The Bodhisattva in the sky is drumming." It wasn't until the 18th century that the American Benjamin Franklin used a kite to attract electricity from the air, thus proving the phenomenon of discharge in the air. This mysterious curtain was then unveiled.

The phenomena of solar and lunar eclipses also had many hypotheses in ancient times. Some said, "It was swallowed by the heavenly dog." Others said, "It was eaten by the wild sun and wild moon." Therefore, when encountering a solar or lunar eclipse, people often made many unconscious actions. Some burned incense and kowtowed, and some beat gongs and drums. Since scientists discovered the principles of celestial body movement, this superstition has also been broken.

Science is not empty, it uses methods to seek truth in everything. Therefore, once superstition encounters science, it will collapse without being attacked. However, there are still superstitious people. We, the little friends with scientific minds, should not follow the superstitions of ordinary people about all new and strange things, thinking that there are gods and ghosts. We should know how to use careful observation and experiments to obtain accurate knowledge.

### Good Ways to Save Paper

— Kun

Little friends, in this era of expensive goods, you must be very willing to help your parents save as much as possible. Here I will tell you a way to save paper (isn't it the same as saving money?):

You must have, and have a lot of, old notebooks and composition books, right? Well, you can remove the binding of them, turn them over page by page (the front side becomes the back side), and then bind them together again. You can use them as scratch paper or other purposes; you can write with a pencil or ink pen. In addition, arithmetic books can also be used to write in the empty spaces.

These are all good ways to save money; little friends, you might as well try it, and show the notebooks you have made to your parents, and you will definitely get their praise.

### Two Fish

— Duanfang

Once upon a time, there were three happy fish living in a small pond. One of the fish used its wisdom at all times, another fish would improvise when necessary, and the third fish never used its brain at all.

One day, two fishermen walked by the pond. They saw three fish swimming back and forth in the clear water.

"Quick, let's go get the net!"

The first fish, which always used its wisdom, heard the fisherman's words and quickly escaped.

After a while, the fishermen came back with the net, first blocking the exit of the pond to prevent the remaining two fish from escaping, and then put the net into the water.

At this time, the second fish began to panic, but soon it floated on the surface of the water and pretended to be dead. The fishermen were finally deceived.

As a result, the fish that didn't use its brain was caught, and the fishermen had a big meal for dinner.

Later, the fishermen became suspicious of the fish that pretended to be dead. They encountered it again a few months later, but were no longer deceived by it, so the result was also very tragic!

Little friends! Are you using your wisdom at all times?

### The Spirit of All Things

— Jin Zhen

The phrase "Man is the spirit of all things" was constantly swirling in Ah Hui's mind because this phrase was often uttered by the teachers in class, and his father sometimes said this to him as well, but he didn't quite understand why man is the spirit of all things? Other animals are not qualified, what is the reason for this? He asked his brother Ah Ming about this question. But Ah Ming didn't have a definite answer either. Later, he waited for a good opportunity to ask his father. "The phrase "Man is the spirit of all things" is not wrong at all. All things refer to all the animals and plants in the world, and man is also a kind of animal, but man's intelligence is much superior to all things. In other words, no creature in the world is as spiritual as man. Therefore, man's position in nature is the highest, and no matter what they want, they can eventually get it. For example, if he wants to catch a bird, he uses various methods to obtain it, such as shooting with a gun, catching with a net, and other clever methods to achieve the goal. This is something other animals cannot do. So why is it only man who has spirituality? This is because man has thoughts, is willing to work hard, can endure hardship, and is willing to persevere. Moreover, man's brain is more developed than other animals, so his thinking is very sensitive, and he has obtained the "real seat" of the spirit of all things. As for what thinking is, there is a layer of protein substance covering the upper part of the human brain, containing nerve cells, about one-tenth to one-quarter of an inch thick. This protein substance is what manages thoughts. If the protein substance is richer, the thinking will be more developed. Man's protein substance grows on the outer lip of the brain, so it can grow and develop, which can make thinking particularly advanced. Ordinary animals also have protein substances, but they only have a thin lip, and they grow on the inside of the brain, so they are not easy to grow and develop, and thinking is also difficult to be sensitive. How does thinking happen? If there is a kind of message, the tiny nerves that are all over the human body will function, circulating through the nerve cells of the protein substance in the brain, and then thinking will occur. For example, if your eyes are focused on these words on this page, then these words will be quickly transmitted to your brain through your optic nerve, and at the same time circulate through the cells in various parts of the brain, and the cells in various parts of the brain will exchange and transmit information about these words to each other. Later, if the message of these words circulates through your brain cells again, you will have the thought of these words, or recall them, or even extend these words and lead to some new meanings. The speed of nerve transmission of messages is usually about 404 feet per second. If a finger is burned or painful, this message takes about one-hundred-and-twenty-fifth of a second to travel from the fingertip to the brain. And other animals can only transmit messages at 90 feet per second. A person who thinks a lot also consumes a little energy, but the amount is very small, less than one percent of the amount consumed by arm strength. Because thinking requires energy consumption, the brain also needs food, which is blood, so there are countless blood vessels in the brain, and a lot of fresh blood is constantly flowing in the blood vessels to supply the needs of nerve cells. Ah Hui's father talked endlessly like this, which made Ah Hui suddenly understand.

### Will Diana Durbin Abandon Her Movie Life?

— Huilin

Now all of Hollywood is watching and concerned about the future of Diana Durbin. People have raised many inevitable questions for her: will she end her movie life after marrying Vincent Frick? Or will she gain greater success due to her marriage?

Undeniably, Diana can be considered the luckiest girl in the world. She has a beautiful appearance, she has a clever mind, and she has a gifted singing voice, which has given her fame and status in the film industry. She stepped into the film industry in 1936, and has since starred in eight films, such as "Three Smart Girls," "One Hundred Men and a Girl," "Mad About Music," "That Certain Age," "First Love," and "It Started with Eve." Every time a film is released, the box office is always unprecedented, and people never tire of watching it. Therefore, Diana has also become the pillar star of Universal Pictures. In the company's budget, the income from Diana's films is also listed. The repeated screenings of the eight films have made the company a lot of money. Diana's unprecedented popularity in film history is very rare. Therefore, the company is also preparing to give her two last films in the short term, one is "Nice Girl?" and the other is "Ready for Romance"; because the company cannot decide whether she will return to the screen after marriage, why not shoot more films for her now and earn more money?

Diana Durbin is very fond of children and is now also practicing housework. She pays close attention to issues such as home decoration and design; it seems that she is not prepared to live a movie life again, but according to Hollywood's general observations, she will not shoot movies again for at least a short period of time, and she is not prepared to change her style even after returning to the screen. If Diana plays a charming role, no one will appreciate her acting skills.

In short, it still depends on Diana's own answer and her future box office situation.

### Fang Peilin Prepares to Shoot Social Film

Minggu

When mentioning "Brother Fang," everyone should know that he is Fang Peilin, the director of "Silver Gun Bandit" of the United Film Company. When he first entered the film industry, he was responsible for scenery work, and successively served in Zhongnan, Xinming, and Great China Lily Companies. It was not until he entered Yihua Company that he gained critical acclaim for the scenery of the film "Woman," and then he jumped to become a director, and the first film he completed was "Avatar Girl."

After the war, he joined the Xinhua lineup and filmed "Thunderstorm," "Wu Zetian," and "Yanmen Pass" and other films, which were well-received. Now, he is filming "Silver Gun Bandit" starring Zhang Huichong, with Zhang Huichong's reputation in "Heroes of the Water" ten years ago, his return to the film industry this time, meeting with people in the film industry after a long time, it is expected that it will cause a stir among people inside and outside the film circle.

Yesterday, the reporter met Fang Peilin and talked about the filming situation of "Silver Gun Bandit." The work is extremely tense. Currently, the scenes of Zhang Huichong are being filmed first, and the scenes of the heroine Long Qiuxia have not yet started. By the end of this month, all of Zhang Huichong's performances can be rushed to completion, because Zhang Huichong will start performing magic at the Lyceum Theatre or the Great Shanghai Theatre next month.

Probably in the middle of next month, "Silver Gun Bandit" may be completed. After the completion of this film, "Brother Fang" talked about a film he is preparing to shoot, a social film. In the midst of the rise of fashion films, he feels that social films cannot be ignored. The script of the social film is being rushed to be written, and the title has been decided as "Hundred Tribulations Rose," which purely reflects the current society, satirizes the current society, and adopts the same approach as the film "Black Paradise."

Chapter Eight: Falling Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water

Just now, when I walked back to my room, the moonlight was very bright, and I could see everything clearly. Suddenly, I saw Sang Yiqing wearing short clothes and slippers, tiptoeing from the inner room towards his own room, gently closing the door, as if he was a thief. How could Xu Jing not understand in his heart? Knowing that today is the sixteenth, Wang Yongtai is observing the precepts and sleeping in the outer room, not entering He Ji's room, it is clear that the adulterer and adulteress are taking advantage of the opportunity to have fun. It's ridiculous that He Ji, already having an affair with her cousin, still holds the heart of wanting more, and insists on seducing himself. She treats the world as black as crows, but she doesn't know that I, Xu Jing, am an upright man. How could I do such a beastly act? Alas! This is tolerable, what is not tolerable? I want to take the opportunity to advise Wang Yongtai to be careful and drive that fellow out, that is the right thing to do. Now that I know this, how can I always learn from the Jin people to keep my mouth shut? Having made up his mind, he went back to his room and rested. The next day, he went to the yamen, and it happened that Zhou Yuji was reviewing the troops outside the city and practicing field battles. He also followed the crowd out of the city to practice, the military appearance was very grand, and he was secretly happy in his heart when he saw it. Because at that time, Li Zicheng had already broken Tongguan, and the rumors were getting tighter and tighter. Zhou Yuji ordered the city defense to be extra strict to prevent the invasion of the bandits, so there was this military review. In the afternoon, when he returned to his room, he saw a maidservant from He Ji's side tidying up the desk in his room, which was filled with some dry pastries. Seeing Xu Jing come back, she told Xu Jing that this was a gift from Madam Ru to the young master. Xu Jing had no choice but to thank her and accept it. After the maidservant finished tidying up, she left. Xu Jing thought to himself, He Ji rejected me severely, but she doesn't hate me and sends me food? It seems that her heart for me is not completely cold, I must be even more careful. When it was time to sleep at night, he found a fragrant handkerchief on the pillow, embroidered with a pair of butterflies flying together, the fragrance was fragrant, it was clearly something from He Ji's side, how did it get to my bed? Thinking of the maidservant who tidied up his pillows and bedding during the day, it must have been that maidservant who secretly put it under my pillow. What is the purpose of this? Although it is said that He Ji's infatuation is immortal, she deliberately sent me this handkerchief, a silkworm cocoon, and still wants to tempt me? Then I will have a hard time living here. (60)

### Sent to "Gonghua"

—Written after seeing the public performance of "Thunderstorm"

I don't know you, but after seeing your fifth experimental performance this time, I want to say a few words to you all.

Generally speaking (not all), the actors did not grasp the personality: Lu Gui is an insidious and cunning villain, Chen Zhongjun seems to have not expressed this clearly enough. If I hadn't read the script, it would be difficult to tell from his appearance that he was a servant in the Zhou mansion. He didn't memorize the lines of the first act well. Because he was too familiar with them, he lacked pauses in the middle, and the tone was not varied enough, which made the audience feel plain and boring.

Zhou Ping's makeup seems a bit old. The person playing him, Ma Qujun, lacks real emotion, especially the lack of thought beforehand for the actions. The movement is too mechanical. Zhuang Huaqun's Shi Ping is not old enough, the movements are also too fast, and many of the words she read are not clearly and fluently uttered. Seeing the scene of Park Yuan, there should be many opportunities to act, but she read it flatly.

Park Yuan's clothes are too new, and the snow-white collar is exposed outside the iron-blue long shirt, which is not the clothing that an old man who feels depressed about world affairs should have. Look: he is still hanging a string of Buddhist beads on his right hand, but because of it, Hai Yili's hand is always bent, like a wounded soldier hanging his hand in a gauze bandage, so his movements are a bit stiff. Mei Lian's makeup is too young. When she and Ping and Chong stand together, no one would believe it if you were to say that Chong'er is her biological child or that Ping'er is younger than her. We feel that she didn't go too far in playing Fan Yi, but not enough. Her smile is not very natural, but she played very well at the beginning of the fourth act.

I really feel sorry for Jiang Hong, who plays Si Feng. Although it is the first time I have seen her act, I think she is someone who knows how to act. Your effects are very good, and the thunderstorm is very realistic. For example, the furniture is too new and too "modern," not like the "eighteen-year-old appearance" that Park often says. The curtains and potted flowers are all in bright red, which is enough to affect the atmosphere of the tragedy. I have said so many critical words, the purpose is just to have an opportunity to discuss with you. However, are you "willing to shake hands with me?"

I wish you success next time.
