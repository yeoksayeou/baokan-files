### International Situation Becomes Clearer After China Breaks Off Relations with Germany and Italy; Anti-Aggression Front Completed; Tensions Between the United States and Japan Further Increase

Chongqing - China's severance of diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy is regarded today as making the overall international situation clearer, no different from the outbreak of the Soviet-German war. China can now openly and completely oppose the Axis powers, thus completing the anti-aggression front. China's policy has long tended in this direction, but due to the maintenance of normal diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, it had to observe diplomatic niceties. Based on this situation, the tendency of China's international policy could not be fully announced to the Chinese public. This complexity has now been eliminated. It is expected that future announcements regarding China's international stance will be simple and direct. China cannot tolerate the actions of the Axis powers, but Chongqing seems to have some regret regarding the severance with Germany, as China has not forgotten the practical assistance that Germany provided in the early stages of the war. This is not influenced by Berlin's official policy towards the Sino-Japanese War. At that time, China obtained a large amount of military equipment and other supplies from Germany, and German military advisors were particularly helpful in the early stages of the war in China. There are also a large number of people, some of whom hold responsible positions, who either studied in Germany or believe that China should imitate Germany militarily and politically. However, these people have remained silent in recent months, and some may have changed their views. All of them, of course, strongly support the government's severance of relations with the Axis powers. There is much less regret expressed regarding China's severance of relations with Italy. Since Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia, China responded by assisting the League of Nations in imposing sanctions, and Sino-Italian relations have been nominal. The Italian side has frankly admitted that Italy's policy on the Sino-Japanese War has always been to promote peace in the Far East, causing China to submit to Japan. According to what was learned today, after Germany's attempt to mediate peace failed when the Chinese government was still in Hankou, the Italian diplomatic side also worked to promote peace. Although it was unsuccessful, Sino-Italian relations did not improve as a result. The Italian ambassador to China never presented his credentials in Chongqing, which further strained Sino-Italian relations. At 8:00 PM yesterday, a special reception was held for the press, during which Shao Yulin, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, read out the Chinese government's declaration of severing diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. The atmosphere was very tense. Shao said that Ling Qihan, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at that time handed Guo Taiqi's declaration and passport to Nolte, Secretary of the German Embassy, and the Secretary of the Italian Embassy. The German Chargé d'Affaires Leisen is in Chengdu, but it is understood that he will return to Chongqing immediately. German reporters did not attend the press conference. It is understood that Haitong News Agency has ceased its services since yesterday. The spokesman declared that the embassies of the Axis countries have been notified that the Chinese government will provide them with all kinds of convenience to leave China via Vietnam. The Chongqing Municipal Government and the Garrison Command have been ordered to do their best to protect the embassy personnel until they withdraw, and the authorities in all cities where German and Italian residents reside have also been ordered to provide protection to them while they remain there. The spokesman also said that the issue of overseas Chinese in Germany and Italy is currently under consideration, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also take all necessary steps regarding the German news agencies in Chongqing. The spokesman also said that a statement is not yet ready regarding the protection of the interests of the Axis powers in China and China's interests in the Axis countries. The diplomatic community today does not believe the prevailing view in Chongqing that the Axis's move is intended to induce Japan to attack the Soviet Union. It is believed here that the main purpose of the recognition is to make the Japanese public believe that there has been some genuine progress in resolving the China issue. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Pro-German Faction in Japan Gains Advantage

New York - The New York Minsheng Forum newspaper recently published an article stating that the Axis countries' recognition of Nanjing has made Germany more biased towards Japan in the Far Eastern war. It also stated that it is credible that the result of the ten-day debate on policy issues in Tokyo has shown that the pro-German faction has the upper hand, and it is feared that Japan will announce a policy that will disturb the United States. The newspaper also believes that Hitler has already paid the price for his demand for Japan's help by recognizing Nanjing in this way. Hitler can then demand that Japan take bold actions to eliminate the enthusiasm of the United States to participate in the Atlantic war. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Tokyo - News today stated that Japan's announcement of simultaneously respecting the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, is the result of an agreement between Tokyo and Berlin. According to the agreement, Japan may continue to work to prevent the United States from participating in the European war in return for the Axis powers' recognition of Nanjing. Japanese believe that Germany and Italy's recognition of Nanjing can further support Japan's policy of trying to overthrow Chongqing. However, as far as Japan is concerned, being able to resolve the China issue is its main problem. Non-Axis people believe that Germany and Italy's recognition has made it impossible for Japan to adopt an independent foreign policy. Therefore, this result can be regarded as another diplomatic victory for Germany. The Axis people in Tokyo all seem to think that whether Japan attacks the Soviet Union is insignificant. These people clearly believe that the United States' aid to the Soviet Union, reaching the West via Vladivostok, will be too late and will not help. However, these people are trying their best to strain Japanese-American relations so that the United States does not dare to participate in the European war. The Axis people here expect that as long as Japan continues to support Nanjing, US-Japan tension will inevitably increase. Because Japan's support for Nanjing is still an incompatible situation with US policy. Looking at the current increase in US aid to Chongqing, the decrease in Soviet aid to Chongqing, and the fact that the United States has become the main force behind General Chiang Kai-shek, it is even more evident that Japan's actions are incompatible with US policy. Now, the Axis's recognition of Nanjing can make Japan more actively tend towards Nanjing's support, making it more impossible for Japan and the United States to compromise on the China issue. Furthermore, the Axis's recognition of Nanjing can enable the Japanese to disregard the recent lack of military achievements and argue for their reasons for engaging in the fourth year of the war.

Withdrawal of Personnel from German and Italian Embassies

Berlin - The official Central Daily News announced today that the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Germany, including Ambassador Chen Jie, a total of 13 people, and the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Italy have been ordered to return to China as soon as possible. The newspaper said that then it will be decided how to return to the country. They will probably take the route through Lisbon, Portugal, and then through the United States to return to the country. There are only two Chinese consulates in the Axis countries, one in Hamburg and one in Milan, but the consular officials have not been ordered to leave. There are about nine hundred Chinese people in Germany, of whom one hundred and eighty are students. There are about five hundred overseas Chinese in Italy, most of whom are businessmen. (United Press Dispatch, 3rd)

Chongqing - According to sources here, the two German news agencies in Chongqing, Haitong News Agency and German News Agency, are now withdrawing. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

Chongqing Newspapers Condemn Germany and Italy

Chongqing - This morning, all newspapers unanimously published articles condemning Germany and Italy, and warmly supporting the government's decision to sever diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy. The newspapers also emphasized that Germany and Italy's recognition will not disturb international vision. China's determination and confidence in the war will be strengthened as a result, and it is vowed to thoroughly implement the determination to completely drive the Japanese army out of the country. The Central Daily News said that the measures currently adopted by the German and Italian authorities are by no means the will of the people of their countries, and it is a pity for the two peoples who hope to lead the German and Italian nations into a deep abyss. As for how Germany and Italy will collude further with Japan, there will be no criticism for the time being due to the unclear content. However, it can be predicted that even if the two sides collude, they may not be sincere, deceiving and exploiting each other, and the result will be the same demise. The Yishi Daily said that the date of Japan's attack on the Soviet Union is imminent. Japan's establishment of one more enemy is naturally beneficial to China. The National Public Newspaper regrets that it has not immediately declared war with it. The Ta Kung Pao said that Japan's request for Germany and Italy to recognize the Nanjing organization at this time is a means for Konoe and Matsuoka to consolidate their positions, and the exchange is a further inclination of Japanese policy towards the Axis. Japan may not attack the Soviet Union immediately at present, at least in terms of posture it is approaching one step further. The world situation has become extremely clear at this point. The four major countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union have only one way to unite and jointly resist the Axis. The Times News said that Germany's military attack on the Soviet Union has not been as smooth as expected, so it recognized the Nanjing organization in exchange for Japan's assistance. Japan has no way out except to attack the Soviet Union, so it will definitely accept Germany and Italy's demands. However, its troop deployment date must be after the return of Chongguang on the 20th of this month. The Saodang News said that what Germany and Italy have done is not only an accidental mistake, but a kind of unforgivable sin. (Havas Dispatch, 3rd)

Editorial

### Striving for Democracy - Celebrating American Independence Day -

Today is the 165th anniversary of the founding of the United States, which is also the day the Declaration of Independence was proclaimed during the Revolutionary War. A hundred and fifty years ago, it was a time when democratic ideas were flourishing. The concept that "all men are created equal," advocated by the philosophers Rousseau, Montesquieu, and Paine, had already deeply rooted itself in the hearts of people on both sides of the Atlantic. However, the transformation from thought to action, making democracy an unyielding political principle, was initiated by the American independence movement. The American writer L. Abbott said: "The French Revolution, the democratic reforms of the British Empire, and the unification of Italy were all products of the American Revolution." This is by no means an overstatement. Today, the strength and prosperity of the United States, and its role as a mainstay in the international political landscape, should be traced back to its traditional roots pursued in the independence movement.

At that time, the thirteen colonies in North America, under the leadership of Washington, launched a passionate and arduous revolutionary movement to demand independence. The reason for this is all known to be aroused by the issue of taxation. However, the reason why the people of the thirteen states unanimously expressed anger was not because of how harsh and irrational the taxes themselves were, but because the taxation violated all democratic principles. They felt that any burden placed upon them without their consent was an intolerable oppression and arbitrariness, and for this, it was worth fighting with blood and life.

Today, these past events have long become historical traces. The United Kingdom and the United States, two Anglo-Saxon nations that once met on the battlefield, ultimately belong to "blood is thicker than water." Moreover, beyond blood factors, there are inseparable interests in practical matters on both sides. This situation is particularly evident when one of the two countries encounters difficulties. However, the spirit of cherishing truth, justice, and valuing everything more than everything else, as demonstrated in the Revolutionary War, remains an important characteristic of the American people to this day. And the various crises experienced over the past 150 years, the most significant being the Civil War and World War I, have all achieved glorious achievements by relying on the basic spirit.

Now the United States is facing unprecedented threats and challenges in history. The aggressive atrocities suffered by the United States directly and indirectly in the past decade are almost impossible to compare with the tea tax and other issues that triggered the Revolutionary War. Therefore, the current moment is also a critical juncture for the American spirit of independence. We firmly believe that the American people's love for justice, truth, and freedom is indeed greater than in the past. This can be seen in their deep hatred for aggressive dictatorship, their enthusiastic actions for all international acts of justice, and especially their sympathy and support for China over the years, which all prove that they will never allow aggression and evil to run rampant while remaining detached. Looking at the aspirations of the US authorities: President Roosevelt's insight and ambition are not only unseen by previous US presidents in the past 20 years, but also show his outstanding talent more than the excessive idealism of the late Wilson. From his speech in Chicago in August 1937 to his recent fireside chat on May 27, it can be proven how his main consistent ideal is to put out the spread of aggressive atrocities. In the past six months, the atmosphere of the United States' participation in the war has matured unexpectedly, and even the recent speech by Navy Secretary Knox also advocated that the US Navy should take advantage of the German army's lack of time to look west and eliminate the harm to the country in the Atlantic. However, if the United States proceeds to participate in the war, it is not necessarily a cause for joy, but it is only compelled by circumstances. As for a few isolationists, they still stubbornly stick to their old ways, and nag incessantly, causing the necessary active measures to be invisibly constrained, thus allowing aggressive crimes to have the opportunity to prolong and expand, which is not only intolerable to justice and humanity, but also a sinner of the American traditional spirit.

Since the outbreak of the Soviet war, the international division has already met the conditions that conform to the ideals of the world, but the cooperation between China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to jointly resist aggression has been slow to manifest itself so far. In this regard, the promotion task undertaken by the United States may be more urgent than direct participation in the war. In addition to celebrating American Independence Day, all justice-loving people around the world are keen to consider this further.

### Nearly a Thousand People Died in Chongqing Tunnel Tragedy; Including 146 Children; Hasty Tunnel Construction Caused This Strange Disaster

Chongqing - The official report of the Chongqing Tunnel Suffocation Case Investigation Committee of June 5th was announced this afternoon. A total of 992 people died, 151 were seriously injured, and 919 corpses were buried by the public. There were 146 children who died. The report stated that the cause of the disaster was hasty construction and a lack of appropriate facilities, followed by poor management. The committee believed that the guards on duty were not at fault, but the air defense engineer and the highest air defense authorities could not shirk their responsibility. The report said that the suffocation was actually caused by the excessive number of people, because 6,555 people took refuge in the tunnel that night, while the usual capacity was only 4,384 people. The tragedy was caused by people in the tunnel rushing out to breathe fresh air, while people outside the tunnel rushed in due to hearing the second air raid alarm, causing them to be pushed down and trampled. The four government banks have donated 500,000 yuan to build ten new air-raid shelters in densely populated areas of the city. (Reuters Dispatch, 3rd)

### Stalin's First Broadcast After the Outbreak of War Between Germany and the Soviet Union: Admits German Troops Have Invaded Soviet Territory, but Says They Will Inevitably Follow in Napoleon's Footsteps

Reuters, Moscow, 3rd—Soviet leader Stalin broadcasted yesterday, saying that although the enemy has been met with heroic resistance from the Red Army and its elite forces have been annihilated, they are still advancing and adding fresh troops to the front lines. Hitler's troops have now occupied most of Lithuania and Latvia, as well as parts of western Belarus and western Ukraine, but they will ultimately suffer defeat, just as Napoleon and Wilhelm II failed. The Soviet people must rise up to defend their sovereignty and territory, and make a united effort to deal with the enemy. All military personnel, both naval and army, and all civilians and soldiers must defend every inch of Soviet territory and fight for their cities and villages to the last drop of blood. Stalin said, "We must provide well-organized assistance to the Red Army in all aspects, using all our efforts to increase its numbers and ensure that the Red Army has obtained all necessary supplies. We must organize the transportation of troops, food, and ammunition, and provide large-scale assistance to the wounded. We must put everything else out of our minds for the benefit of the front lines and the work of defeating the enemy." He also urged intensified efforts to increase arms production and protect central power stations, telephone and telegraph communications, and local defense plans. He also mentioned the strategy of retreat, which the Russians have historically used effectively. It is said that when the Soviet army retreats, it will not leave behind a single railway locomotive or vehicle, an ounce of grain, or a gallon of gasoline for the German army. Farmers must take away all their livestock and hand over the slaughtered animals to state agencies for safekeeping and transportation to the rear. He continued, "In all areas occupied by the German army, all possible steps must be taken to render the German efforts ineffective. Therefore, guerrilla units and sabotage organizations must be established to resist the enemy's troops. The work of these guerrilla teams will be to destroy bridges, highways, enemy telephone and other communications, and set fire to fuel. It is essential to create a situation in the occupied areas that the enemy cannot bear." Germany, as a belligerent, had already mobilized before the war, deploying 170 divisions of troops to the border area, fully prepared, awaiting the signal to attack, while the Soviet army was still waiting to be mobilized and deployed to the border. Germany suddenly broke its promise, violating the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and disregarding world opinion. He added that the purpose of this war to resist fascist aggressors is not only to avoid the dangers that the Soviet Union will encounter, but also to help all the people of Europe who are groaning under the bondage of German fascism. The famous words of British Prime Minister Churchill in support of the Soviet Union and the declaration of the US government regarding preparations to aid the Soviet Union are significant in this regard. Finally, he said that the National Defense Committee has now been established, and all state power is concentrated in the hands of the committee, and it has already begun its work. He now calls on the people of the whole country to rally under the leadership of the Lenin Party and the Soviet government, so that they can assist the navy and army in annihilating the enemy and achieving victory.

### Partial Reorganization of the Finnish Cabinet

Haitong News Agency, Helsinki, 3rd—According to newspaper reports, the Finnish cabinet is about to be reorganized. The leader of the Social Democratic Party, Tanner, conducted Soviet-Finnish negotiations before the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish War in December 1939.

### Military Service is the Top Priority for Resistance and Reconstruction: Chiang Orders Thorough Implementation; Sons of Gentry and Civil Servants Should Conscientiously Enlist

Chongqing—The Military Affairs Commission recently launched a campaign for the sons of gentry and civil servants to join the army. On the 2nd, Chairman Chiang issued a telegram, ordering all localities to comply. The telegram is recorded below. It is noted that military service is the top priority for resistance and reconstruction. This important political matter must be taken the lead by the sons of gentry and civil servants, setting an example for the people, so as to establish a good atmosphere and promote smooth implementation. In March of the 27th year [1938], the Provisional National Congress of our Party resolved to strive to promote the military service system, stipulating that civil servants and party members should send their children and relatives to perform military service as an example. In July of the 28th year [1939], the Chairman [Chiang Kai-shek] wrote to the gentry and educators across the country, urging civil servants and local gentry to personally send their children of conscription age to enlist in the army without waiting for the draw, and to send them to various military schools, so as to set an example. However, in recent years, there have been people who are the sons of gentry and civil servants who have enlisted, but there are also many who have taken advantage of their superior positions to avoid conscription. This is due to the failure to deeply establish the idea of service and to thoroughly implement it. Therefore, a campaign for the sons of gentry and civil servants to join the army has been launched, and the governors of each province are instructed to order the counties and cities to formulate detailed methods for thorough implementation, so as to achieve practical results within this year. In addition to separate telegrams, you are to comply with this order and report the handling situation as necessary. Chiang Kai-shek (telegram on the 2nd)

The Germans claim to be making broad advances towards Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv, while a Moscow spokesperson claimed that Soviet forces would annihilate the vanguard of German armored divisions and said that the Soviet army could "guarantee that Hitler will never win."

Associated Press, Berlin, 3rd—German troops advanced on three fronts yesterday: the central front towards Moscow, the southern front towards Kyiv, the heart of Ukraine, and the northern front through the Baltic states towards Leningrad. The High Command stated that the German southern flank is advancing, splitting into two routes south of the Pripet Marshes. The first route follows the highway via Raków towards Kyiv and the center of Ukraine. It is reported that the vanguard has passed the old Soviet-Polish border on the Kyiv highway. The second route saw German troops engage in a tank battle with Soviet forces near Szczerzec, 50 miles east of Lviv, after occupying Lviv.

Associated Press, Moscow, 3rd—According to yesterday evening's communiqué, the German armored columns' attempt to make a major breakthrough towards Moscow encountered fierce Soviet resistance at Borisov, 50 miles east of Minsk. This is because it is the same route Napoleon took when he led a large army to attack Moscow. The Germans appear to be attempting their largest breakthrough operation in the Belarusian triangle region east of Minsk. The apex of this triangle is Borisov, the southwestern point is Rusk, 55 miles from Minsk, and the southeastern point is Bobruisk, 85 miles southeast of Minsk.

Reuters, London, 3rd—Although German troops have advanced hundreds of miles since the outbreak of hostilities on the Eastern Front, their progress has now slowed considerably due to strong Soviet resistance and fierce Soviet air support, and in some places has even been completely blocked. London military sources indicated today that the German advance appears to have begun to slow down. The main areas of operation are currently southeast of Minsk, where the Soviet army is engaged in a major battle to prevent the German advance to the east. The main German forces are attempting to break through towards Moscow in this area. A recent Soviet communiqué stated that German troops had been blocked in the area around Minsk and Lierk, while the Germans claimed to have crossed the Prut River. The Soviet communiqué mainly concerned the fighting in the Lierk area south of the Pripet Marshes, from which the Germans are now fiercely attacking Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. According to Moscow, Soviet forces have blocked the German mechanized units' advance at Shepetovka, on the direct route to Kyiv. The Germans then attempted to break through south towards Tarnopol. According to the Soviet announcement, this offensive was stopped after fierce fighting throughout the night. Reports from all sides indicate that the Soviet troops in this area are currently putting up very strong resistance. On the Bessarabian border, the German communiqué claimed today that Romanian troops had crossed the Prut River in northern Moldova yesterday and are now advancing. A major battle is currently taking place in the triangular area formed by the three cities of Borisov, Bobruisk, and Rusk in Belarus.

Soviet War Report

TASS, Moscow, 3rd—On June 3rd, our troops engaged in fierce fighting with enemy infantry in the Murmansk and Kestenga areas. In the areas of Dvinsk, Borisov, Strutsk, Bobruisk, and Rusk, our troops also fought fiercely with enemy mobile units. On other fronts, Soviet troops held their defensive positions, defeating the enemy's attempts to cross the border. In the Murmansk area, two divisions of enemy infantry attacked the Sredny Peninsula and its southeastern area. Our troops have stopped them and launched a counterattack. The enemy suffered heavy losses. In the Kola and Karelian Isthmus areas, our troops have repelled the advancing enemy, inflicting heavy casualties. In the Dvinsk area, our troops fought fiercely at midday against enemies attempting to break through in the northeast. The battle is still continuing. In the Borisov and Strutsk, Bobruisk areas, our troops fought enemy mobile units all day. The enemy attempted to break through but was stopped by our troops' strong counterattacks and the air force. In the Rusk area, our troops continued to fight fiercely in the Rovno region. The enemy is still trying to break through the southeastern border. Our troops launched fierce counterattacks every time the enemy attacked. Our air force fiercely attacked enemy tank units in the Rusk area during the day and bombed several areas in Bucharest. Naval vessels and air force of the Northern Fleet assisted the Red Army in fighting attacking enemy units. During air battles, five enemy planes were shot down by naval aircraft.

TASS, Moscow, 3rd—Last night, fierce fighting continued in the Murmansk, Dvinsk, Minsk, and Rusk areas. In the Murmansk area, the enemy began to attack the Sredny Peninsula. Our troops resisted resolutely, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. In the Dvinsk and Minsk areas, our troops took drastic action on the night of July 2nd, destroying the enemy's vanguard tank units. At night, our troops fought motorized and mechanized units in the Rusk area, inflicting heavy casualties. On July 1st, the weather was very bad, and flying was extremely difficult, but our air force still successfully bombed enemy tank units in the Tvirk and Minsk areas, destroying many enemy planes and tanks, while also causing difficulties in the enemy's supply of military equipment and preventing the advance of the enemy's motorized infantry. It was previously reported that 56 enemy planes were shot down on June 30th, but according to accurate statistics, 102 enemy planes were shot down. In addition, our air force bombed enemy airfields, and 50 enemy planes were unable to escape. On July 1st, 54 enemy planes were shot down, and only two of our planes did not return to their airfields.

Havas News Agency, Moscow, 3rd—The Information Bureau has just released a war report stating that last night the fighting was most intense along the Borisov-Kremenets-Tsibara-Telnabar line in the central sector. The enemy repeatedly attempted to cross the Berezina River by force, but the Red Army resisted fiercely and eventually repelled the enemy.

Summary of the Situation

Reuters, London, 3rd—The German and Soviet military headquarters' recent communiqués have both claimed major victories. Neutral sources in Stockholm reported this morning that German troops are now only 325 miles from Moscow, while the Soviets are currently concentrating a large army to launch a counterattack in an effort to defeat the enemy. The Stockholm report also stated that the German troops advancing towards the Soviet capital are the vanguard that broke into Minsk, and this route of German troops has left the main road from Minsk via Smolensk to Moscow. Their purpose is clearly to implement an encirclement operation, as was done east of Bialystok. The Soviets are concentrating a large army in Smolensk (250 miles east of Minsk and west of Moscow) to prepare for a counterattack. At the same time, several divisions of fresh Soviet troops are heading west towards Moscow in an endless stream. The situation on the Soviet front is summarized as follows: from northern to southern Finland, the Soviets say that Soviet troops are still resisting strongly in the Murmansk area, but the situation in the port of Murmansk is unknown. Finnish sources say that the railway line from Leningrad to Murmansk has been cut off. There is no news of fighting in southern Finland.

Baltic States: The Germans say that they have occupied the Latvian capital of Riga and the Ventra area west of Riga along the Baltic Sea. The chances of Soviet troops breaking out are now very small, and the Soviet troops retreating into Estonia are also being bombed by German aircraft. Swedish reports say that German paratroopers have landed near Taidu (formerly Dorpat) in Estonia. Although the Soviet troops in the Murmansk area appear to be succeeding in their operations, and the Germans near Kaunas, Lithuania, have been contained, it is heard from London that the Soviet troops in these two Baltic coastal states are currently facing major difficulties.

Minsk Area: The Germans say that most of the two Soviet forces isolated east of Bialystok have been destroyed. In addition, since the Soviet report previously said that Soviet forces had destroyed the vanguard tanks of the enemy, no official news has been received from that area. The neutral report that the German tank columns are now 325 miles from Moscow means that the German troops have only advanced 35 miles after reaching the Berezina River.

Lviv Area: Moscow reports say that the German troops departing from Lviv have been stopped by Soviet troops. This news may confirm the German report of fighting 50 miles east and about 35 miles southeast of Lviv. The Germans admitted that Soviet armored vehicles launched fierce counterattacks but claimed to have repelled them. London believes that there are still Soviet troops fighting more than 100 miles behind the German vanguard. News from Budapest today said that the Hungarian army is taking the offensive, and its purpose may be to break the resistance of this part of the Soviet army. The Hungarian General Staff has announced, "There are no more Soviet troops on the Hungarian border because the enemy has retreated to new positions after being attacked."

Romanian Border: There is no news from the Romanian side, except for the Soviet naval newspaper "Red Fleet" reporting that Soviet warships shelled and destroyed the naval base of Constanța yesterday.

End of the Great Encirclement Battle in Poland; Germany Claims to Have Captured 160,000 Soviet Troops

Haitong News Agency, German Headquarters, 3rd—The German High Command announced that in the battle east of Bialystok (northeast of Warsaw, Poland), from June 22nd to July 3rd, German troops captured 5,770 tanks, 2,330 artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns, countless armored vehicles, machine guns, and rifles. At the same time, the Soviet Union lost 4,725 aircraft, of which 1,392 were shot down in air combat, 112 were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and 3,221 were destroyed at airfields. Currently, 160,000 Soviet troops have been captured. Soviet troops repeatedly attempted to break out, and the number of dead and wounded was several times the number of prisoners.

Haitong News Agency, German Headquarters, 3rd—Today's German war report stated that German and Romanian forces are advancing side by side from northern Moldova and have crossed the Prut River. The entire Soviet front from the Black Sea to the Arctic Ocean is encountering the Allied forces' advance. The Soviet military authorities' attempt to prevent the Allied forces from entering has apparently failed. The Soviet army is already in retreat. The decisive battle east of Bialystok, which is of great importance in world history, is about to end. Countless Soviet cavalry and tank units in the north have been annihilated. The German air force is cooperating very effectively with the army.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 3rd—A responsible person released a supplementary statement to the German war report, stating that the Soviet war report has admitted to the retreat in Galicia and the loss of Lviv. In the Rusk area, the Soviet army launched a fierce attack with armored divisions but has been annihilated. The German army has occupied the southern part of the Pripet Marshes. The Soviet army in the north is being encircled and annihilated. The German army on the northern front has crossed the Daugava River between Daugavpils and Riga. The Soviet army south of the Gulf of Riga and west of Riga has been surrounded. Because the port of Ventspils has fallen into German hands, the surrounded Soviet army has no hope of escaping by ship. German aircraft have controlled the skies from the front lines to the enemy's rear. Most of the land that the Soviet Union gained from Poland and the Baltic states from 1939 to 1940 has been occupied by the German army. Currently, the German army is attacking the Soviet mainland.

Associated Press, Berlin, 3rd—It was announced here that the German High Command yesterday dispatched additional fresh troops to participate in the war. The German offensive is "proceeding smoothly along a 2,000-mile winding front." The German headquarters also stated that another major encirclement battle since Dunkirk has now been resolved with the surrender of 160,000 Soviet troops in the pocket.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 3rd—The German army has captured the Osowiec Fortress in the Biebrza River marsh area. This is the third time the German army has occupied it in 30 years. After fierce fighting, the German army captured more than 2,000 Soviet troops, seized 14 tanks, 34 artillery pieces, about 100 machine guns, and 20 aircraft. More than 1,000 Soviet soldiers' bodies were left on the battlefield.

### Britain Announces for the First Time that the American Volunteer Air Force "Eagle Squadron" is Participating in the War: Three German Planes Shot Down in Northern France; No Air Raids in British Territory During the Day Before Yesterday

Associated Press, London, 3rd—Britain announced that the American Volunteer Air Force "Eagle Squadron" in the Royal Air Force participated in the attack on northern France yesterday. This is the first time that the Eagle Squadron's participation in aerial combat has been officially mentioned.

Reuters, London, 3rd—The Air Ministry communiqué stated that the British Air Force attacked northern France again yesterday afternoon, destroying 18 enemy fighters, of which 16 were shot down by British fighters (3 by the American Eagle Squadron) and 2 were shot down by British bombers. The British Air Force lost 2 bombers and 8 fighters. British Blenheim bombers, protected by a large squadron of fighters, attacked the Merville airfield near Lille, and bombs fell on the runway, buildings, and among enemy aircraft parked on the airfield. The railway junction southeast of Lille was also bombed. Although the ground defenses and a large squadron of enemy fighters put up strong resistance, they ultimately failed to prevent the British aircraft's fierce attack.

Reuters, London, 3rd—The Air Ministry announced that there were still no air raids in British airspace during the day yesterday. As of 6:00 PM, no reports of bombs falling in any part of Britain had been received.

Reuters, London, 3rd—Last night, British aircraft continued to bomb German ports, communication lines, and heavy industries. Bremen, Duisburg, and Düsseldorf were the main targets. According to the Air Ministry communiqué released this morning, large fires broke out in the industrial areas of the above three cities, and Bremen was bombed even more severely. Oil depots in Hamburg and Rotterdam were also attacked. Although enemy fighters and anti-aircraft guns put up resistance, they were overcome. One enemy fighter was hit by a British heavy bomber over the Netherlands and crashed to the ground. Also, an enemy supply ship near the French coast in the English Channel was attacked by a British Coastal Command aircraft. Four British bombers went missing.

### Japanese Government Requisitions Cargo Ships Bound for the United States

Associated Press, Manila, 3rd—The Japanese government's action of requisitioning Japanese ships carrying military raw materials from the Philippines to the United States has sparked various speculations here about Japan's motives. The Manila shipping industry has been notified that the Japanese ship Kyusyn Maru, which was en route from Manila to the United States, was stopped in Kobe yesterday and ordered to unload cargo such as sugar, coconut oil, abaca, and chromium produced in the Philippines. The Nizima Maru, which is currently here, has also been ordered by the Japanese government to unload 6,000 tons of chromium bound for the United States. The cargo was loaded last week. After unloading, the Japanese ship was ordered to return to Japan. The Bordeos Maru, loaded with 3,600 tons of chromium, was also stopped in Kobe and ordered to unload its cargo. Japan's actions have made the Philippine shipping industry feel uneasy because, since the United States canceled many voyages to the Pacific Ocean, they have largely relied on Japanese shipping to transport goods across the Pacific. Business circles believe that Japan's actions are a reprisal for the United States expanding export controls to the Philippines, which has cut off the supply of abaca, coconut oil, manganese, chromium, copper, and other goods needed by Japan. Japan's actions will prevent the US government from using Japanese ships to transport military raw materials to the United States.

### British Troops in Syria Recapture Palmyra

United Press International, Cairo, 3rd – A British General Headquarters communiqué stated that British forces have recaptured the Syrian palm grove (Palmyra), which controls the eastern half of Syria. It was previously surrounded and counterattacked by French forces, leading to a temporary loss. Heavy fighting also occurred near Nebek, near Damascus, where British and Free French forces repelled an attack by Vichy forces, destroying several tanks and capturing one.

Havas, Vichy, 2nd – An official communiqué released tonight stated that in the past twenty-four hours, British forces have concentrated their strength and launched several attacks on Palmyra in northern Syria. A mechanized unit of the enemy also advanced from Iraq along the Euphrates River, making contact with our forces at Tel Aazer. In southern Lebanon, our patrols repelled enemy sentries at Jezzine.

### Random Notes on the European War (6)(6): Paratrooper Training and Tactics

Between fields, ditches crisscross. On straight roads, wooden stakes and other obstacles are everywhere, creating countless narrow alleys. Soldiers are scattered like stars, everywhere. This is a snapshot of today's Britain.

This scarred countryside has come about as a result of the German "vertical envelopment" strategy. "Vertical envelopment" is a new type of offensive tactic from the sky. This tactic is not bombing, but rather the landing of troops from the air to attack the enemy. The defending forces must dig trenches and set up obstacles to prevent aircraft from landing.

Of course, paratroopers and airborne troops alone are too weak to conquer a well-prepared country. But if used as part of an invading force, the invasion has a much better chance of success. When the Soviet Union first tested the dropping of soldiers and equipment from airplanes, most of us thought of parachute demonstrations at rural markets. The plane flew very high, and in broad daylight, with everyone watching, the parachutist jumped, and the parachute did not open. Just as the audience held their breath in complete silence, he pulled the rope, and the parachute suddenly opened, his body floating gently to the ground. Watching the paratrooper descend slowly from the sky, how easy it would be to hit such a target!

But in war, the landing technique of paratroopers is very different.

A few lookouts are on duty, and mobile units are stationed at key locations, ready to move at a moment's notice. It is a starry night, and all is silent. The watchmen are vigilant, afraid to close their eyes. At first, they hear nothing, but suddenly they hear a soft but firm command: "Surrender!" Taken by surprise, they are surrounded by the enemy, who have already launched their offensive, and they cannot resist.

What is going on?

The planes carrying these paratroopers fly high in the sky, stopping their engines far from the destination and gliding silently in the dark. At the selected location, plainclothes agents signal, and the planes suddenly begin dropping paratroopers from a height of less than one hundred yards. The soldiers jump out of the plane one by one, open their parachutes, and float to the ground. At the same time, other parachutes drop weapons, ammunition, and various equipment.

In just a few seconds, catching the guards off guard, or even before they see them, the paratroopers have reached the ground, assembled their weapons, and formed a small combat team with offensive capabilities. They are fully armed, with pistols, rifles, light machine guns, and even light mortars. Guided by the plainclothes agents, this small but powerful combat team begins to move.

This is indeed a "mission of sacrifice," its purpose being to disrupt enemy transportation and various facilities. But these paratroopers are the vanguard of the airborne troops. Because airborne troops must land in transport planes, which is no different from ordinary troop transport, they can carry heavy weapons, but they must have an airfield prepared for landing. The purpose of these paratroopers is to occupy, clear, and secure the airfield.

This is not purely theoretical; it is a general picture of what is really happening in today's war. Take the example of the Dutch troops guarding the Maas River bridge. They were ordered to defend the bridge and, if necessary, destroy it to prevent the German advance. But before they could react, the bridge was seized by paratroopers, and the vanguard of the German armored division was able to cross the Maas River and advance rapidly. In Rotterdam, German paratroopers landed and occupied the weakly guarded Waalhaven airfield. Airborne troops then landed at the airfield, and seaplanes landed in the nearby waterways at the same time.

During the German invasion of Norway, paratroopers also helped to hinder the Allied advance on several occasions. Planes also carried large numbers of German troops across the Skagerrak Strait. It is said that the Germans used a secret weapon when occupying the Eben Emael fortress in Belgium. Whether this secret weapon existed is debatable, but it can be asserted that German paratroopers were a new factor in the capture of the fortress. Paratroopers also played an important role in the German attacks on Greece and Yugoslavia.

But airborne invasion is not easy. When the Germans attempted to land airborne troops in Belgium at Chièvres, they unexpectedly found the ground full of motorcycles. Because they could not land, the operation failed. From this lesson, the Germans learned that paratroopers must land first from airborne troops to clear the airfield. According to one story, German paratroopers in Narvik, Norway, were killed or injured because they landed too low and fell on the rugged rocks.

There are conflicting reports about the success of the British paratroopers who landed in Italy, but it is clear that the entire force was wiped out, either killed, wounded, or captured. This was expected and is inherent in the nature of the work. Paratroopers on a mission of sacrifice must be willing to sacrifice themselves to complete the task of destroying some important transportation link.

Not just anyone can be a paratrooper. Because the work is too dangerous, only daredevils are allowed to volunteer. And because paratroopers often have to fight on the ground under extremely unfavorable conditions, only elite soldiers who have received complete training in other areas are allowed to volunteer. Therefore, paratroopers must be strong and agile, and not too old, at most in their thirties. Also, because most paratroopers attack locations and targets that they have never seen before, they must be able to read military maps without error and understand the meaning of every shadow in aerial photographs.

When these carefully selected men begin paratrooper training, they must be deeply surprised, wondering if they are in the military or in a circus. Rope walking and somersaulting techniques are emphasized because paratroopers must be familiar with how to land without injury. They initially make several test jumps from a platform five or six feet high. Although it looks easy, they will be violently shaken if they don't know how to land.

Special instructors explain how to relax the whole body when landing and bend the knees slightly to avoid injury. Once they have mastered this technique, they can jump from higher up. If equipment allows, they can practice descending in a controlled parachute seat, so the new recruits can get used to this kind of jolt. Only then can they drop freely without ropes. But the Germans prefer to make their initial jumps from airplanes. They believe that descending from a tower does not closely resemble real conditions and is therefore of little value. During training, they can learn how to exit the plane from simulated or real planes on the ground.

Each trainee is also guided by experts to study the parachute and how to fold it. A poorly folded parachute may not open. If he knows that his parachute was folded by an expert, and that expert is himself, it will increase his confidence. American paratroopers carry a reserve parachute in addition to their regular parachute.

Paratroopers must also learn how to fight on the ground with the parachute. A parachute that is twenty-eight feet wide and full of wind is not easy to control. It can drag a strong man off the ground like a runaway horse, pulling him along. Only by knowing how to control the ropes and "leak" the wind can this be avoided.

The day of the first jump is a memorable day for a paratrooper. Whether he is accepted or not, he has an unspeakable feeling in his heart. This is not nervousness, but rather too much hope. The first jump requires special courage. Even those who are known for their bravery may be afraid to jump. There have been cases where a plane was damaged and forced to descend, and others jumped out and landed safely, but a soldier refused to obey the pilot's orders, preferring to perish with the plane. There is also a story that a certain American paratrooper battalion had completed all its training, but when it came time for the first jump, the soldiers stood at the door of the plane, frozen like chickens, afraid to jump.

The parachutist knows that all safety measures have been implemented, and the pilot has chosen a position to drop a dummy to test the wind direction. He hears the commands to prepare and jump, and he attaches the rope that opens the parachute to a metal line on the plane. When the final command is given, he jumps down. But this novice cannot yet be called a paratrooper. This is just the first jump. He must practice many times before he can earn the honorary title of paratrooper.

Today's leading powers have established paratrooper teams and airborne infantry. The United States has already formed the 501st Parachute Battalion, indicating that the experimental stage is over and the development stage has begun. The War Department has ordered the formation of three more paratrooper battalions, and several airborne infantry units are in training.

Rumor has it that Germany has built 28,000 gliders, each capable of carrying fourteen fully equipped soldiers. One transport plane or bomber can tow two gliders. So, in theory, Germany has the ability to transport 400,000 airborne troops and paratroopers. (The End)

### British Mission to the Soviet Union Holds Important Talks; British Embassy Hosts Grand Reception; British Parliamentarian Proposes Cooperation Between British and Soviet Air Forces

Reuters, Moscow, 3rd – The British mission continued practical talks with Soviet representatives yesterday, and progress was reportedly made. Last night, the British Embassy held the first social gathering since the mission's arrival, hosted by British Ambassador Cripps. In addition to Soviet Vice Foreign Secretary Vyshinsky, Sobolov, and Soviet representatives from the army, navy, and air force, many diplomats, such as the ambassadors from the United States, Turkey, China, and Iran, as well as the Swedish minister, attended. The Soviet Union has now formed a five-member National Defense Committee. Many factories are holding meetings, calling for the establishment of a war cabinet like the British one.

Havas, Washington, 2nd – After the Soviet government requested that the United States sell various raw materials to the country, political figures here recently commented that the Soviet government hopes that the German-Soviet war will last for a long time, becoming a protracted war of attrition. This can be seen from this request. General MacFarlane, chief representative of the British military delegation, has gone to the headquarters of the Red Army on the Western Front after meeting with Soviet authorities to examine the actual situation. This is further proof that Britain is providing technical assistance to the Soviet Union in its fight against Germany. However, it is not yet known what kind of assistance the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Umansky, requested from the United States when he visited Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday. It can be asserted that the United States may supply the Soviet Union with machine tools to increase the output of its arms industry. Aviation gasoline is also an important item that the United States may supply to the Soviet Union.

Reuters, London, 3rd – During a House of Commons session, a member asked whether the British side would prepare to share the operational experience of the British Air Force and the production experience of the British aircraft industry with the Soviet Union for reference. Minister of Aircraft Production Brabazon replied, "Yes. Detailed preparations have not yet been made, but the British side will provide the Soviet Union with all kinds of assistance." A member requested that some British workers be sent to the Soviet Union. He did not answer this question.

### Soviet Union Expresses Satisfaction with Actions of Britain and the United States

Reuters, Moscow, 3rd – A spokesman for the Soviet government stated yesterday while hosting news reporters that the Soviet government expressed satisfaction and gratitude for the declarations made by US President Roosevelt, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Undersecretary of State Welles regarding resistance to German domination. Soviet newspapers excerpted sympathetic words about the Soviet Union from British newspapers. One newspaper stated, "Soviet workers now feel that they are not alone. The attacks by Finland and other countries against the Soviet Union are merely an extension of German aggression, 'not an attack on the Soviet Union by Germany.'" Strict fire and poison gas prevention measures are now being carried out in Moscow. On the streets, the public can be seen lined up, waiting for newspapers or listening to radio broadcasts, apart from the men, women, and children who have evacuated to rural areas.

### British Public Holds Mass Meeting, Expresses Sympathy for Soviet Union

TASS, London, 3rd – Mass meetings were held in several British cities, resolving to share common interests with the Soviet Union. 1,500 people were present in London. Resolutions were passed, willing to be the backing of the British government to assist the Soviet Union to resist fascist Germany. Several participants in the conferences expressed to the Soviet ambassador in London, that they are in sympathy with the Soviet Union.

### American Sympathy for the Soviet Union Increases Daily

TASS, New York, 3rd – American sympathy for the Soviet Union is increasing daily. Most American newspapers support the American declaration issued by Roosevelt, to assist the Soviet Union within possible boundaries. The Soviet consulate receives daily a large batch of letters from labor unions, public organizations, and individuals. Several senators also advocate assisting the Soviet Union as much as possible. Senator Smith said, "We must supply the Soviet Union with all necessities." Several public organizations and labor unions have issued declarations, stating that they will do their best to help the Soviet people resist. These organizations include the American-Soviet Union Association, the American Student Union, and others. Well-known American cultural figures also enthusiastically advocate supporting the Soviet Union. Secondly, an American radio station raised the question, "Should America help the Soviet Union?" 80 percent of the listeners said that they should assist. This can represent the majority of the American public’s opinion, and even more prove the depth of the American public's sympathy for the Soviet Union. The Soviet people have actually obtained the assistance of all mankind, especially the majority of the American public.

### Mexican Parliamentarians Sympathize With Soviet Union, Advocate Confiscation of German and Italian Property

TASS, New York, 3rd – According to Mexican newspapers, the Mexican Parliament is discussing the Soviet-German war. Most parliamentarians believe that the Soviet Union will win. "Senator Chivalier said that he sympathizes with the Soviet Union and advocates closing the consulates in Mexico. To prevent fascist propaganda in the Americas, German and Italian property in Mexico should be confiscated." Senator Gullias said, "The Soviet-German war is actually the beginning of Germany's demise, because the Soviet Union has an excellent air force and mechanized units."

### Soviet Nationals in Japan Will Soon Evacuate

Reuters, Tokyo, 3rd – The Soviet Embassy announced this afternoon that Soviet women and children would be evacuated home. The first group of one hundred women and children, including the families of Soviet Embassy personnel, will depart on July 5, taking the Siberian Railway. The Soviet side has considered various methods to guarantee the safety of the evacuees along the way. Due to the railway being too crowded, they will be divided into two groups.

### Japan Divided on Policy Toward Germany and Soviet Union; One Faction Advocates Cautious Action, One Faction Advocates Preparing for Britain and United States

Havas, Tokyo, 3rd – This morning, editorials in local newspapers about Japan's attitude toward the German-Soviet war revealed two trends. One trend opposes alliance policies, firmly insisting that Japan must be independent and self-determined, and not be bound by any country. The other trend advocates adopting a policy of non-interference, so that Japan can focus all its efforts on the situation in the Pacific to prevent Britain and the United States from intensifying their encirclement of Japan. The Asahi Shimbun represents the former opinion, stating, "Japan should not be moved by considerations of glory and interest. Prime Minister Konoe recently said, 'Japan should not take advantage of others' misfortunes and act rashly.' This statement is perfectly reasonable. Japan must pursue an independent policy, relying only on its own strength." The Hochi Shimbun's tone is even more blunt, stating, "Japan can no longer trust the various countries in Europe. Japanese-German cooperation has become a thing of the past. Japan has now recognized its own position and must act independently, without assistance." The Yomiuri Shimbun represents the latter opinion, stating, "Japan should shift its gaze from the north to the south, because Britain and the United States will take advantage of the current situation to strengthen their anti-Japanese policies. The United States is currently sending planes and pilots to Chongqing, prohibiting merchant ships of third countries from passing through the Panama Canal, and intensifying its hostile encirclement of Japan in the area from Singapore to Midway Island, and increasing defensive construction on Midway and Trinidad islands. All of this should be noted. Therefore, we should not focus solely on the German-Soviet war, but should expose the enemy's attempt to use the German-Soviet war to attack Japan's conspiracy."

United Press International, Washington, 3rd – Political circles declared today that Japan's statement, respecting both the Tripartite Pact and the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, seems sufficient to reveal that the elements within Japan who advocate an independent policy and do not openly support Axis operations have at least temporarily gained the upper hand. This means that, outwardly, Japan has decided in the near future to refrain from directly assisting Germany, such as attacking Siberia or using its navy to invade and seize the interests of Britain and the Netherlands. On the contrary, Japan's policy seems to be to indirectly assist the Axis, while focusing on establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so that Japan can be self-reliant and have independent strength. Political experts rarely interpret this move as favorable to the United States, because in any case, the US fleet will be forced to remain in the Pacific, and Japan may change its policy at any time.

### British Interests in China Impaired; Question Raised in House of Commons; Answer Given by Foreign Secretary Eden

Reuters, London, 3rd – What was mostly discussed in the House of Commons last night were incidents in China. Members raised various questions to Foreign Secretary Eden, such as the activities of anti-British groups in North China, the Japanese restrictions on shipping between ports in Shanghai and Zhejiang, and the circulation of legal tender in the occupied areas of China. Conservative Party member Hannah first asked whether the Foreign Secretary had received a report regarding the chairman of the Anti-British Federation, who stated that anyone who openly ships goods would not be forgiven, and what actions the Foreign Office had taken regarding this matter. Eden replied that, according to reports received, there was no evidence that the sales of British goods in Peiping had been affected by the activities of the Anti-British Federation. Conservative Party member Milner asked whether the Foreign Secretary was aware that shipping in Shanghai, Ningbo, and other places was generally prohibited by the Japanese authorities on the pretext of military necessity, except for Japanese ships, thus hindering British shipping companies, and whether he had taken steps to stop this exclusive action that discriminated against British trade. Eden replied that the Japanese naval authorities, in their announcements on July 15 and August 10 last year, prohibited ships of any nationality from entering designated areas of the Chinese coast, including the ports of Zhejiang Province. Since then, no British ships have sailed to the ports of Zhejiang Province, but British rights have been formally reserved. The British side has negotiated with the Japanese authorities regarding interference in British shipping. Milner then asked whether the Foreign Secretary could not make more forceful negotiations, given that the necessity of the so-called military reservations by the Japanese had changed with the passage of time. Eden replied that he agreed with Milner's assumption about the situation. This is all within the general position of negotiations with Japan. The Japanese people accused us of the economic restrictions we imposed on the Japanese people, but this is the only answer, and we cannot help until the situation improves.

### Governor of Oregon Urges US Aid to China; US Should Fully Protect Lines of Communication

United Press International, Boston, 3rd – The Governor of Oregon, Sprague, said yesterday at the Governors' Conference, "If Japan launches a war against the Dutch East Indies or Singapore, then action by the US Navy 'is evidently required'." He also said that the United States must "fully protect all US lines of communication in the Far East, because any victory by Japan in South Asia would be sufficient to cut off major raw materials and supplies." Sprague opposed Philippine independence, because their military and commercial position are very important, and argued that adequate protection should be given to the islands, "so that our position obtains a reasonable security from Japan." He also stated that if the United States could continue to supply China with adequate goods, it might maintain the balance of power in the East without armed intervention.

### Knox's Statement: America Not Escorting

Reuters, Washington, 3rd – President Roosevelt's hope that America could remain outside the war has become the focus of attention at Secretary of the Navy Knox's press conference today. Knox recently strongly advocated for American action. Today, Knox explicitly stated to reporters that American ships patrolling the Atlantic are not being used to escort ships, nor are they engaged in any war activities. There have been no crew casualties or equipment losses. When reporters questioned him about Congress's criticism of his call for America to eliminate Nazi threats in the Atlantic, Knox declined to comment further, only acknowledging that he stands by what he has already said. More responsible newspaper critics have offered quite blunt opinions. The New York Times's Washington correspondent, Mr. Krock, stated that, on the surface, one of Roosevelt's cabinet members is now openly advocating a policy contrary to that of the President. The President hopes for peace, while this cabinet member calls for war. This can be seen as insubordination. However, Knox is trusted by President Roosevelt and participates in confidential discussions. His continued assertion that the President's hesitation endangers national security suggests that the President himself may not disagree with Knox's views, hoping that the ensuing discussions will garner support from a divided nation for future major decisions. In other words, this is a staged performance to prepare the public. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the President has not wavered from his promise to continue aiding Britain. The Baltimore Sun demands that the nation be shown the facts, stating that cabinet members should speak either less than Knox or more than Knox. It also stated that America's openly implemented policy of recognizing Britain not only as a friendly nation but also as a comrade should be vigorously pursued and not revert to isolation. The majority of the nation has already decided to provide Britain with complete and effective aid. After increasing production, war materials should be delivered to Britain. If they are not delivered immediately, the reasons why and the necessary remedies should be explained to the nation. The American people, for their own protection, should know what they need to know and be provided leadership in whatever steps are necessary for their own protection. The Washington Post hopes that Knox's comments will be a precursor to American action, stating that if Hitler establishes himself in Europe, America will soon be fragmented on land, and America's voice in the world will become a faint whisper. It is not yet too late to thwart Hitler's plan to create a great empire to threaten the world. Britain and America should strike while Hitler is fighting the Soviet Union, so that both Europe and America can be freed from their shackles.

### Securities: Same Chinese Bonds, Domestic and Foreign Diverge. Foreign Debts Soar, Domestic Debts Plunge. Joy or Fear? Which is Right and Which is Wrong?

London, 2nd (Wednesday) – Today's Chinese foreign debts and Far East British company share listings saw a boost. Previous Chinese foreign debts all rose. Sino-French US dollars (with stamps) rose £7 to £45, Rehabilitation (British issued) rose £5 to £36, Anglo-French (British issued) and Chrisp rose £4 each, the former to £42 and the latter to £27. Anglo-German Continuation (British issued) rose £2 to £42. Subsequent railway bonds only saw Hukuang German issue fall £1 to £12. British stocks: Ma Jia Li Bank rose 3 shillings and 9 pence to £8 16 shillings and 3 pence, HSBC Bank UK registered shares rose half a pound to £76, and Kailan Mining unregistered shares rose 6 pence to 12 shillings and 6 pence. No other changes. In the midst of turbulent times, the repeated rise of Chinese foreign debt shows Britain's optimistic view of China's future.

After a two-day holiday, the gray market for public bonds resumed trading yesterday. Due to changes in the environment, the market situation suddenly caused weak-willed bulls to emerge, and a sharp decline began. Because bulls usually concentrate on types C and E, the drop in these two types was also the greatest. Rumors are rampant, and the truth cannot be determined. However, observing the rise of foreign debts in London shows that there is no reason for the decline of domestic debts, and that they are short-sighted, taking a corner accident as a shift, and not thinking of the clear distinction, which is a good omen for a glorious future. The bond market has been hit. In the afternoon, there was a rumor of the court taking over, and type C suddenly broke the two-yuan mark. For a time, many parties emerged, and with the pressure of short sellers, the market situation declined in a straight line with no turning point. The future is temporarily difficult to recover. Only when the market stabilizes can there be hope of a turnaround. However, it still needs to change with the situation. In the morning, the opening price was still good due to the purchase of Tongkang and Xiexing. However, as Hongda bulls emerged, and Xinfu also sold off, the market situation declined in a straight line. Because Yitai and Xinhua had a large appetite, although Tongxing and Xiekang still sold, type C failed to break the two-yuan mark. In the afternoon, rumors became more prevalent. Yitai and Yongchang still had a strong appetite, and Lianyi and Runde also bought in, but Renfeng, Renchang, Xieda, Hongda, and Lianhe all sold off. The market opened and broke below the two-yuan mark. As a result of oversupply, the decline became more severe. Type A broke 80 yuan, and type E broke 70 yuan. The market situation was irreversible. As a result, all fell by 65 cents to 1 yuan and 45 cents. The total number of transactions was about 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Stock trading: 50 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 91 yuan and 75 cents.

The stock market of the Public Chamber of Commerce is still active. Rubber stock trading has increased sharply. The quoted price was heard to be lower than the previous closing price, and then partially recovered to a high level, but the result was still softening. The buying of rubber stocks is very strong, and the prices of several types have been raised significantly.

### Finance: Sudden Tightness in Foreign Exchange

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed exchange rates remained flat, but the gray market for British and American exchange rates suddenly became tight, and gold prices soared again. After the morning opening, the Bank of England and HSBC suddenly came to absorb, and Chinese speculators also turned to force purchases. As a result, around 11:00, the US dollar softened to 5.3125 yuan, and the British gold also tightened to 3 pence 25. After the supply of Chinese banks, the tightening stopped slightly at noon. In the afternoon, foreign banks still lacked the intention to supply, while Chinese banks suddenly slightly absorbed. Speculative buying reignited, causing the recent British gold to soften to 5.25 yuan and the British gold to reach 3 pence 25. When it was heard that Japanese warships were concentrated in the Lushun area, the US dollar rebounded slightly. August 5.3125 yuan can be settled, and the recent British exchange rate is still tightly squeezed. The entire day's trading was very active.

HSBC Absorption Starts Tightness

Since the morning foreign cable silver market, the British, American, and Indian markets have not changed during the holiday. The exchange rates of various countries are flat. The US to British exchange rate rose 25, the US to Shanghai exchange rate rose a small 3 points, the US to Japanese exchange rate rose 14 cents, and the British market exchange rates were all flat. The domestic market opened early with bank selling prices. Spot prices are flat. The British exchange rate is 3 pence 296875, and the US dollar is 5.40625. After the opening, speculative buyers and sellers were mixed under the rumor of many benefits. Because HSBC absorbed Chinese banks' July US dollars at 5.375 yuan, a tightening trend began. HSBC's listed exchange rates have not changed. The small counter's US exchange rate has been reduced by 0625, for a total of 5.3125 yuan. The silver balance tax is still slightly 23.75 percent. Speculators are forcing to buy July and August 5.375 yuan, and Chinese banks are also constantly spitting out, and the situation has stabilized for a while. Until around 10:00, speculators also turned to buy July and August 5.34375 yuan, so it continued to soften to 5.3125 yuan, and British gold softened to 3 pence 25. Fortunately, Chinese banks maintained a continuous supply, and the tightening stopped slightly. At noon, British gold closed at 3 pence 265625, and the US dollar closed at 5.34375 yuan.

Chinese Commercial Banks Emerge and Re-enter

In the afternoon, Chinese speculators still operated both buying and selling. Chinese banks transferred speculative July 5.34375 yuan and 3125 yuan to speculators. Foreign banks' intentions to supply were dim, but they had a stomach for it. The market trend was gradually tightening. Chinese merchants came to re-enter August 5.3125 yuan, the tightest recent and distant months were settled at 5.28125 yuan (one said the recent 5.25 yuan), and the market situation was mixed. At the 3:30 closing, spot to August were all British exchange rates of 3 pence 25, compared with the closing before the holiday (30th), all tightened by 046875. US exchange rates spot to July were 5 yuan 28125, squeezing tight by 125, and August was 5.3125 yuan, tightening by 09375.

The "Lianchao" gray market rose 7 corners and a half to 62 yuan 7 corners and a half.

### Post-Holiday Gold Market Sees Sudden and Intense Surge, Peak Reaching 6,570 Yuan

Yesterday, the gold market, operating in the unofficial "fried red" market, resumed business as usual. Breaking a two-month period of stagnation, it experienced a sudden and intense surge. Prices soared past the 6,500-yuan mark, rapidly advancing toward new highs. This occurred during the bank's semi-annual holiday, fueled by various favorable rumors and heightened investor enthusiasm. Although Huipiao merchants Xinfengyong cashed out 16,000 taels throughout the day and went short, and Tianyuan also sold an additional 5,000 to 6,000 taels, the Shanghai West Side gangs aggressively bought in, with Yiyuan flipping to a long position with 25,000 to 26,000 taels. Hengji also bought in 600 to 700 taels. Small investors were mostly long, and market prices were bid up with no restraining pressure. Consequently, the price rose from 6,445 yuan to 6,570 yuan in the afternoon. It only stopped rising and slightly retreated when news of Japanese warships concentrating in the Lushun area spread. Nevertheless, it still closed up 142 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 60,000 to 70,000 taels. Cash transactions saw Yili paying Chengji 80 taels, and Mingfeng and Shengyuan Yong, along with Xintian Shi and Fengxiang Heji, paying a total of 120 taels. In the afternoon, Yongfengyu paid Chengji 120 taels. Prices for all transactions were 280 yuan higher than the current futures price, with bullion up 100 yuan and jewelry up 10 yuan, reaching 705 yuan.

Futures Rise by 140 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) benefited from positive rumors and tight foreign exchange rates, leading to unanimous upward sentiment. Therefore, the market opened at 9:15 AM amidst strong buying, with prices already up to 6,450 yuan, 41 yuan higher than the closing price before the holiday (the 30th). Subsequently, amidst confusion, it rose to 6,465 yuan, then retreated to 6,445 yuan. Gongda, Dafeng, and Xianghe aggressively bought in, while Yifeng tentatively added to their positions. Prices gradually trended upward, reaching 6,490 yuan, as Dafeng, Chengji, Xinfengyong, and Xiangxingyong sold. At 10:30 AM, the price was 6,473 yuan. Yiyuan’s aggressive buying increased, and Dafeng and Renchengyong also bought. When news of the US dollar weakening to 5.3125 yuan spread, prices soared past 6,500 yuan, reaching 6,520 yuan. At noon, Tianyuan aggressively sold short, and Xiangxingyong scrambled to sell. As the foreign exchange rate slightly strengthened, prices immediately retreated to 6,490 yuan. The market closed at noon at 6,500 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 2:00 PM, immediately rising 15 yuan to 6,515 yuan amidst continued buying pressure. Individual investors who had bid up prices took profits, pushing the price down slightly to 6,502 yuan. Yiyuan returned with minor purchases, and Hengji, Yida, and Hesheng scrambled to buy. When news spread that it was difficult to settle US dollars at 5.28125 yuan this month, individual investors resumed buying aggressively, further intensifying the upward momentum. The price then rose another 68 yuan, reaching 6,570 yuan. Later, news of Japanese warships concentrating in Lushun caused Yiyuan, along with Tianwu and Xinfengyong, to sell frantically, finally halting the rise and causing a decline to 6,550 yuan. The market closed at 3:30 PM at 6,551 yuan, still a sharp 142 yuan higher than before the holiday. Based on the settlement price of the US dollar at 5.28125 yuan for July, the equivalent price was 6,594 yuan, a discount of 43 yuan. After the close, Tianyuan and others continued to sell, causing a retreat to 6,535 yuan. The price fluctuated by 125 yuan throughout the day. The buying price for the current price gold offered by cash shops was 290 yuan higher than the unofficial futures price, and the selling price was 70 yuan lower than the buying price. There were no prices or trading activity for spot bullion.

Jewelry Shops Offer Large Spreads

The initial offering price for gold jewelry from jewelry shops was 695 yuan per tael. It rose 5 yuan at noon and another 5 yuan at 4:00 PM, reaching 705 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 40 yuan, for a total increase of 10 yuan, it was said.

### A Temporary Flourishing

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw a sharp rise in the unofficial market prices. British and American gold pounds also rose by one yuan each. British gold bills remained stable, and market prices remained level. American gold bills opened at 43 cents, and Xiangyuanyong, Tongxinghang, Shunyuan, and Qiafeng scrambled to buy, pushing it up to 69 cents. Zhengda Yongfeng sold, causing a retreat to 61 cents. The market closed at noon at 64 cents. In the afternoon, the market opened at 61 cents, and Xing, Yongheshunyuan, Zhengda Yongfeng, and others bought, pushing it up to 82 cents.

Korean bills showed a slight upward trend, reaching 1.57 yuan in the evening.

### Yarn Flowers Appear, Impacting the Yarn Market, Golden Horse Futures Gain Momentum, Trading Volume Increases to 30,000 Bales, Market Improves and Yarn Prices Rise Sharply

The yarn market continued to be strong and trended from stable to rising. This was because many yarn companies with short positions had gone bankrupt, resulting in a shortage of credit. There were many covering shorts, and at the same time, demand from Guangdong was strong. Therefore, the price of 20s and 30s yarn gradually increased, rising by another 20 to 30 yuan. As a result, investor sentiment improved, and the market moved forward. However, some still felt the price was high and took some short positions. However, raw cotton prices continued to rise, increasing manufacturing costs. The high price for 20s Double Horse yarn was 1,642 yuan, and the low price was 1,594 yuan. In the afternoon, there were few attendees at the market. Initial trades were at 1,630 yuan, rising to 1,645 yuan. The final price was 1,625 yuan. Currently, the fundamentals of the yarn market are considered to be solid due to a shortage of some 20s yarn and the difficulty in loosening cotton prices.

Golden Horse morning opening market image was flat and unremarkable, and the initial price was 1,605 yuan, rising to 1,608 yuan. At this time, sellers appeared, and the price fell back to 1,594 yuan. However, major players covered shorts en masse, and exchange rates changed to shortening, and gold prices rose. At the same time, real sales in Guangdong were booming, so buying sentiment turned strong, and the market gradually rose to 1,642 yuan.

### Foodstuffs: The Rice Market Fluctuates but Ultimately Settles at Level

Yesterday, Dimi continued to build on a stable base, rising initially and then weakening. The result was still about one yuan higher than the previous market. After the market opened in the morning, there was a supply of public sale Hong Kong rice on the street, and the interest was still weak. However, the Ke gang was very greedy, and apart from some decorations in Ningbo, Nanyang, and rural villages in the interior, there were new packing facilities in Hankou and the Yangtze River area, and speculators seized the opportunity to hoard, so the market immediately rose, rising by one yuan to nearly two yuan, but after the rise, large households dumped, and the profit-taking closings and new retail investors were more willing to sell, so the market rose and fell again. Yinhua Division No. 2 Siam 142.5 yuan, small twist nine 149.5 yuan, period 149 yuan, broken rice 113.5 yuan to 113 yuan, all of which were larger than the previous day. No. 1 current Saigon 129 yuan, No. 2 Saigon once opened to 123 yuan, small twist 124 yuan, but the actual sales were light, and the villagers in the interior and other gangs saw the market price rebounding, their thoughts turned lazy, and they all stopped. However, the stores on the street were still focused on flat rice, and extended to the later market, and finally gave up and depreciated. As a result, the closing price was the same compared to the previous market, with one rise and one fall before and after the price. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon is 1267 yuan, and No. 2 is high from 122 yuan to 110 yuan, No. 1 Siam 125 yuan, special 1312 yuan, No. 2 121 yuan, 120 yuan, fire grain 1256 yuan, Qiefo rice 126.5 yuan, 126 yuan, Min Party Zhongguan 126 yuan, small grain 122.5 yuan, 122 yuan, Tokyo tip Zhongguan 112 yuan, 110 yuan, broken tip 956 yuan, rice green 111 yuan, and total transaction volume was 22,000 bags, and Yinhua Division's original bags were 1,200 tons.

### Hardware Fair Tie Breaks 500 Yuan Barrier

The two-hundred-pound American Fair Tie, which is circulating in the market, has been in short supply for half a month. Recently, it has become even more insufficient due to the enthusiastic collection of toy factories, can factories, printing factories, cigarette factories, biscuit factories, and hoarding help on this street. In addition, foreign company orders have been cancelled, and the source has been cut off. Therefore, people's hearts are strangely high, and the market has suddenly seen a situation where supply cannot meet demand.

Highest Ideals Maintain Independence

Shanghai American Consul General Rockhead, US Asiatic Fleet Yangtze Patrol Commander Rear Admiral Glassford, and US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment Commander in Shanghai Colonel Howard, all issued "July 4th" messages to the overseas Chinese. Rock said, "Americans all over the world are celebrating the 165th anniversary of American Independence today. After a long and painful experience, we have achieved independence. To this day, all true Americans, regardless of where they live, regardless of race, creed, or political affiliation, regard maintaining independence as the highest ideal. We Americans are extremely proud of enjoying our rights. These rights are part of a free and independent government, inherited from generation to generation, and are what Americans everywhere are thinking about today. The United States has experienced periods of war and peace, suffering and joy, and has been influenced by this unshakeable principle. It would be too much to say that we are determined to maintain independence and will not encounter obstacles as in the past, but we have overcome these obstacles in the past. The free will of the American people is the guarantee that our independence can be preserved."

Serious Threat No Greater Than Today

Glassford's message reads: "One hundred and sixty-five years after our ancestors declared independence, the threat to the lives, liberty, and pursuit of happiness of their descendants has never been more serious than what we face today. We should pay serious attention to this reality and guarantee each other with our lives, fortunes, and sacred honor, unite strongly, and compete with the courage and spirit of our ancestors against the force that now seeks to establish absolute tyranny over us and those who live like us, as it did in the past."

Full Preparation for Common Defense

Howard's message reads: "The President of the United States has instructed all American people to rededicate themselves to the basic principles outlined in the Declaration of Independence on July 4th of this year. The first basic principle of independence is stipulated in the preamble to the Constitution, which is 'to prepare for the common defense.' Our country's history has shown that this principle has been neglected in the past. Now, to the greatest extent possible, we are fully preparing for the common defense. At the same time, we ourselves or our children must not neglect this necessary principle of independence and freedom in the future."

### The Weather is Hot, and Cholera is Spreading; Citizens Should Pay Close Attention; A Girl in the French Concession Died from the Disease; Citizens Should Get Vaccinated and Emphasize Hygiene

The Public Concession's Epidemic Hospital discovered three cases of true cholera a few days ago. One had already died, and two had recovered, as previously reported in this newspaper. Now it is known that two cases of true cholera have also recently been discovered in the French Concession.

One Dead, One Recovered

The first case involved an 11-year-old Chinese girl who died of cholera. The second case involved a Chinese woman whose initial illness was severe but later greatly lessened. The Hygiene Research Institute tested these two cases and found cholera bacteria, confirming them as true cholera. However, both cases were transmitted from other cities. The aforementioned girl arrived in Shanghai from Shaoxing by boat on June 21st and already showed signs of cholera at that time. It was found that the girl had not received any preventative vaccination. As for the second case, the Chinese woman boarded a ship in Ningbo on June 20th and received a preventative vaccination on the ship, but the dosage and nature (the quantity of dead bacteria contained) of the injection are unknown. The woman fell ill three days after arriving in Shanghai. Twenty people lived in her house, but only she became ill, indicating that the illness was already latent when she arrived in Shanghai.

Pay Attention to Prevention

Regardless, cholera has occurred in the French Concession, which is undeniable. The current health authorities are taking various measures to prevent the spread of the epidemic. All residents, for their own sake and the sake of others, should cooperate to eliminate it. They should pay special attention to their diet, boil water before drinking, and cook and store food properly to avoid contact with flies, as flies are a well-known medium for transmitting diseases. Their feet and sucking tubes spread cholera bacteria. If someone contracts the disease, they should be sent to an epidemic hospital for absolute isolation. Suspicious feces should be disinfected with chemicals (Lysol). To avoid cholera, it is necessary to receive preventative vaccinations. The case of the aforementioned woman teaches us the following three lessons: (1) Preventative vaccinations require a certain period of time to become effective; this time is 15 days. (2) The injection must contain a considerable amount of dead bacteria and dosage to be effective, so one should not be afraid of minor reactions after the injection. (3) Even if preventative vaccinations cannot completely prevent the occurrence of the disease, they can at least greatly reduce its severity. This is why the aforementioned woman was able to recover, while the girl who did not receive a preventative vaccination ultimately died.

### Japanese Troops in Hongkou Relocated

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Japanese side has used the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas as a military transport center, occupying wharves and factories along the Pudong River in Shanghai as barracks or storage places for military supplies. Usually, military vehicles rumbled on the roads in these areas. However, since the day before yesterday, a Japanese military wounded soldier hospital and a military supply station suddenly withdrew, attracting attention from all sides. For example, at the old site of the Samsung Yarn Factory at the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Ningguo Road, there was previously an open space adjacent to the Huangpu River. The Japanese side had enclosed it with bamboo fences and turned it into a resting place for the Japanese army. Guards were heavily stationed in front of the gate, and there were more than 2,000 soldiers inside, including infantry and cavalry, who often practiced in the camp. All Japanese military movements often used this place as a starting and ending point. However, since the end of last week, the Japanese troops stationed there suddenly withdrew, and the place is now completely empty. Additionally, the Japanese military wounded soldier hospital at the Yong'an Textile Factory at the intersection of Pingliang Road and Meizhou Road, which had been occupied by the Japanese army since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and housed more than 700 wounded soldiers, was also completely evacuated the day before yesterday.

### Recent Extreme Weather Changes; Hurricane Hits Luzon Island; Humidity Breaks Records; Accumulated Water in Western Shanghai Not Yet Gone

The second hurricane following in the Pacific Ocean reached east of Luzon Island at 6:00 AM yesterday and is continuing to move in a northwesterly direction. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, the current position of the hurricane is 17 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude. The wind force at the center within 60 nautical miles is six to seven on the Beaufort scale. If it continues to move in a northwesterly direction without changing, the coast of China will be hit.

Low Pressure Passed Shanghai Yesterday

Furthermore, according to a report from the Datong News Agency, the low-pressure system that originated in the eastern part of Jiangxi Province passed Shanghai from the west at 5:00 AM yesterday and quickly entered the Yellow Sea. Therefore, the wind direction in Shanghai has changed, and the weather is expected to improve.

Humidity Reaches 90%

Due to the continuous influence of the moldy rain, the weather in Shanghai has been exceptionally humid, and the goods stored in various warehouses have been severely affected. Those storing goods are under threat. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the recent air humidity has exceeded records. On the 1st of this month, it was 72% to 89%, and on the 2nd, it was 75% to 90%. Goods stored in general are extremely susceptible to mildew due to this humidity.

Water Accumulation in the Western District Difficult to Recede

Since several heavy rains in Shanghai, many roads in the area of the extra-territorial roads in western Shanghai have been plagued by accumulated water. After the recent showers, the water accumulation has increased. Currently, the low-lying roads around Yuyuan Road, Difeng Road, Anhe Temple Road, Kaixuan Road, and Columbia Road have not yet receded, causing great trouble for pedestrians. Although the weather has cleared up, there is still no hope of the water receding.

### Various Businesses Consider Market Conditions and Implement Interest Rate Reductions; Excessive Floating Capital and Narrow Lending Channels Make Interest Rate Reductions Necessary to Avoid Losses

After settling accounts for the first half of the 30th year of the Republic of China, the silver and money industries resumed business yesterday after the holiday period. Various industry markets, such as foreign exchange, gold, securities, and cotton yarn, also resumed business and trading at the same time. Regarding the operations of various businesses in the first half of the year, due to the abundance of floating capital in Shanghai, both fixed and current deposits have increased. However, the channels for investment in Shanghai are becoming increasingly narrow. Therefore, although the settlement results still show a profit, it is not as high as last year. The operating policy for the second half of the year is to implement the established policy, reduce deposit interest rates to lighten the burden, and be particularly cautious about lending, especially focusing on mortgage business. Daily necessities are refused as collateral to avoid fueling speculation.

Zhejiang Xingye Implements Check Fees

A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired with banking circles and learned that after the British banks HSBC and Mercantile first implemented a fee for customers using checks, charging two jiao of national currency per check, various Chinese banks decided to follow the HSBC and Mercantile method and implement it on their own schedules. Now, Zhejiang Xingye Bank and others are implementing a fee for using checks starting in July, charging one jiao of national currency per check, which is deducted from the deposit when used. This means that a checkbook (25 checks) costs two yuan and five jiao, aiming to reduce the abuse of checks by depositors and compensate for the loss of paper and printing costs.

Interest Rate Reduction Methods Are Not Uniform

To alleviate the burden of interest, various banks and money shops have implemented a reduction in current deposit interest rates since the second half of last year. Now, they have canceled the preferential deposit methods previously set and, starting in July, will further reduce the current deposit interest rate for using checks to two li. Fixed deposits will be reduced from five li to two fen. However, the methods are not completely uniform among various banks and money shops. Each bank and money shop sets its own rates based on market conditions. However, for fixed deposits with already agreed-upon interest rates, the interest will be calculated according to the agreed-upon rate. If the depositor wants to renew the deposit after maturity, they must implement the newly set interest rate. Additionally, if deposits are not withdrawn after the due date, no interest will be calculated beyond the due date.

### Workers Arrested in Taikoo Wharf Fight Released; Foreman Gan Renzhong Dies

Zhubaoshan Road in the French Concession is lined with pubs and dance halls, and their customers are mostly Westerners and soldiers from various countries.

### Famine in Shaoxing Intensifies; Urgent Need for Food Relief

Since a portion of eastern Zhejiang was lost, the people have been displaced and do not know what to do, especially with the unprecedented food panic, leading to situations where people are selling their children to buy food. The Shaoxing and Yuyao native place associations in Shanghai, recognizing the severity of the disaster in their hometowns, felt they could not stand idly by. They requested joint relief measures from the Shanghai Red Swastika Society, as the society has branches in Ningbo, Zhenhai, Yuyao, Shaoxing, Shangyu, and other counties, and cooperation with them would be more effective. According to a responsible person from the Red Swastika Society, the most urgent need in eastern Zhejiang is food. They are currently raising funds to purchase rice and are also requesting a portion of American wheat from the American Red Cross to alleviate the immediate crisis. However, the biggest difficulty is the blocked transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang. They are actively finding ways to transport the food there as soon as possible. As for the current relief situation in eastern Zhejiang, there are no detailed reports. The following is a brief account of what is known.

(Shaoxing) The postal and telegraph services in Yuyao are currently unavailable, and the situation there is unknown. However, the Red Swastika Society and the native place association each remitted 100,000 yuan to the area before the occupation to set up congee kitchens and provide relief. Although the remittances were confirmed to have been received, an incident occurred shortly thereafter, and the current situation is unclear. There is also no news from Shaoxing. It is reported that the area is full of starving people and corpses are seen everywhere. The society is very busy with burial work.

(Shangyu) Around the 10th of last month, the city was subjected to a major looting, followed by arson, destroying many houses and leaving many refugees displaced. The Red Swastika Society has established two shelters in the south of the city and in Baiguan, housing hundreds of refugees. At the same time, the Zhejiang authorities, seeing the accumulation of stored grain in the area, are organizing the sale of grain at fair prices in the surrounding villages.

### French Community Prepares for National Day

The 14th of this month is the anniversary of the establishment of the democratic Republic of France. In previous years, French merchants in Shanghai have enthusiastically celebrated. As the date approaches this year, the French Concession authorities have begun preparations. However, due to the war in Europe, there will be no enthusiastic displays, only celebrations.

### Shanghai Epidemic Hospital This Week's Medical Report

Since the discovery of Xie Aqi and two others suffering from true cholera at the Yu Qiaqing Road Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, there have been no further discoveries. However, as it is now early summer and the weather is sultry, infection is most likely. On average, about 600 people per day have come to the hospital for treatment this week, with an average of more than 130 inpatients. Currently, it is only the beginning of summer, and there are already so many sick people. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention to hygiene and avoid cold foods to reduce the source of disease.

### Japanese Navy Registers Jewish Refugees; The Goal is to Prevent Undesirable Elements; There are Approximately 10,000 Jews in Hongkou

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Japanese Navy Rehabilitation Class in Shanghai is currently registering European Jewish refugees in Hongkou. A Japanese Navy officer stated that the main purpose of this measure is to determine whether Jewish refugees residing in Hongkou have the necessary permits. The ultimate goal is to determine whether any undesirable elements reside in the Hongkou district. The work carried out so far is only to complete the registration of Jewish immigrants. It is estimated that there are currently 15,000 European Jewish refugees residing in Hongkou, of whom only 6,000 have registered with the Japanese Consulate.

### War Spreads, Production Declines; British and American Purchases of Chinese Goods; Shanghai National Goods Factories Actively Negotiating

Since the sudden outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the participating countries in Europe have been rushing to manufacture the items needed for wartime, resulting in a virtual decline in the production of various daily necessities. Not only is it impossible to transfer them abroad for sale, but they are also trying to purchase daily necessities from abroad. The large and small national goods factories in Shanghai, considering the time of war, believe that the time to promote fine national goods has arrived. They are now individually improving quality and gradually increasing production. It is reported that in addition to the various territories in Southeast Asia sending telegrams to order large amounts of fine national goods, British and American merchants have also sent telegrams to order daily necessities. However, ships transporting goods are now being actively negotiated by relevant national goods corporations, so that they can be transported to their destinations on schedule.

Yesterday, a tycoon of a certain national goods factory said that Shanghai's entire national goods industry has been relatively depressed and sluggish over the years due to the impact of the Shanghai War. Domestic sales are depressed, and Southbound sales are also subject to twists and turns from time to time. Not only are there few ships available to transport large quantities of goods, but the unsettled international situation has made those who want to order goods hesitant. Under this situation, the national goods factories in Shanghai have made little progress. Now that exports are booming and there is still room for recovery in domestic sales, all large and small national goods factories are striving to make all their products scientific in order to achieve perfection and compete in the market, hoping to gain a superior position. Therefore, even if we take the small socks factory industry as an example, the number of factories being established is like bamboo shoots after rain.

### Shanghai Customs Exports; Duty-Free Exceeds Taxable

The Inspector General of Customs released the value of taxable and duty-free goods imported and exported by Shanghai Customs in May of the 30th year: (1) Value of taxable imports: Customs Gold Unit 17,855,960; value of duty-free imports: Customs Gold Unit 8,687,089; (2) Value of taxable exports: National Currency 70,066,525; value of duty-free exports: National Currency 120,707,930.

### Shanghai-Shaoxing Postal Service Restored

The postal service between Shanghai and Shaoxing was once suspended due to the war. Now that transportation has gradually resumed, it has been restored. Savings and remittances have also been restored.

### Notes on Robberies

At around 11:00 PM the night before last, three robbers suddenly arrived at the residence of a person surnamed Mou at No. 17 Elkin Road in the Public Concession. Two of them were holding pistols. They forced the victim to reveal where he had hidden his cash. The victim refused and resisted slightly, resulting in the robbers injuring his head with the butt of a pistol. As a result, they still robbed him of 2,500 yuan and escaped.

Near Alabastine Road and Gansu Road, at around 6:00 AM yesterday, a woman was walking through the area when she was suddenly robbed by three robbers. One of them showed a pistol. She was robbed of two gold rings and a watch, estimated to be worth 200 yuan.

At the intersection of Tangshan Road and Xi'an Road in Hongkou at 7:30 PM last night, two Westerners robbed a man, stealing 60 yuan in cash.

### Dinghai Shanghai Native Place Association Seeks Congress News; Initial Unveiling Scores Over 7,000

The team leaders then handed in their scores. The total score was more than 7,000. On the same day, enthusiastic people such as Zhou Rangsan, Wu Jingshan, Ding Zihua, and Wu Maoyun, upon learning that the association was organizing a scholarship fund, automatically pledged to donate on the spot, the amount of which was quite considerable.

### Continued Notes on Visiting the Xingxia Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition (Lu)

Yesterday morning there was heavy rain, and I was bored at home. I read the Shanghai News and saw that there was a Xingxia Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition being held at the Pudong Building, so I drove there. I went around and looked at it and thought that it was magnificent and beautiful beyond description. Although I saw it quickly, I was able to learn a little about the calligraphers and painters of the association.

Among the works on display, the works of Dai Jing'an Sigong were particularly spirited, with his work grand and expansive. His structure was seamless, his brushstrokes were deliberate, and he directly combined the strengths of Xu Tianchi, Zhang Chuanshan, Zhao Yishu, and others, melting them into one. His Hundred Longevity Figures were bold and steady, capturing the essence of the famous Song and Yuan masters; his other small pieces, such as vegetables, fruits, and bottle flowers, were also lifelike. Xiang Jiyun's small regular script was as small as a fly's head, delicate and neat, and was truly a master of the era. Even the three Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist scriptures, the Seal Script Classic of Filial Piety in ink, and the Ancient Text of the Great Learning in ink, were all miniature booklets that could be folded and hidden in a wallet. Sixteen fan surfaces, each able to write five lines, could be said to be very small.

In addition, Min Ruizhi's calligraphy was concise and elegant, with the force penetrating the paper, and those without great skill and strength could not hope to match him. There was also Huang Yunyi's couplet in clerical script, which was ancient, simple, and unpretentious, without any horizontal habits. And the plum orchids and bamboos and stones of the monk Yun Ai, although not much ink was used, were full of natural interest, and one could imagine his leisurely mood and his calm and humorous mind, completely revealed in his brush and ink. Zhu Jicheng's calligraphy, painting, and iron pen were also outstanding works in the association. His calligraphy was bold and unrestrained, and his iron pen was ancient and simple, truly worthy of the name of a master craftsman. Furthermore, Jiang Runshen's figures and landscapes were also rare in recent times. His sketches of figures were no different from those from the Song and Yuan paintings, and the landscapes were charming and pleasing, which was very rare. Although there were too many other writers to list, there were a few more writers that I knew very well and that were known to society, so I had to mention them briefly here. Ms. Mao Suihua was a prominent disciple of Feng Chaoran, specializing in figures and also skilled in landscapes. Because she had been taught by a famous teacher, she had obtained the secrets of the heart and nature, and was naturally extraordinary. Although Zhu Fugan was a prominent disciple of Zhang Daqian and Shan Ma Zi, he was particularly interested in the study of landscapes, so he deeply understood the secrets of his teacher. Ding Guanyan was a prominent disciple of Chen Jia'an of Wumen, and his works on birds and flowers were always valued by the world. Fan Xizhong was skilled in bamboos and stones, and was a prominent disciple of Yang Dongshan. The old master Dongshan was an eminent scholar, so it was appropriate for him to have a talented disciple. Furthermore, Ms. Liu Jie was a prominent disciple of Deng Fenweng, and her calligraphy was very skillful, just like her teacher. In addition, there were not many works by Zhang Shutong on display, only a few, and the most exquisite of them were fan surfaces. These kinds of fan surfaces would not be ashamed to be placed among the Ming and Qing masters. Even more, there were authentic works by Confucius and Mu Dao Ren hanging in the main hall. This was a work of divine inspiration, unlike others, and enough to add luster to the association. I spent three or four hours visiting the association. By then it was already past noon, so I had to hire a car to return home and did not have time to read everything one by one.

They formed a group and intercepted the wheat on the tiger carts. Each cart was loaded with ten bags of wheat. All of the carts were overturned by these people. Seeing this, the escort urgently reported to the police station. The police station sent Western Police Head Bowman and detectives to the scene, and arrested 11 people, including Yong natives Guo Shunyuan, and brought them into the police station. It was also learned that the wheat belonged to Hoxinglu Chenxing in the Temple of the Sun.

### Han Xiao Qizi Shot Dead; Held a 10th Anniversary Memorial Feast for His Deceased Father; Returned Home After the Banquet and Ended His Life with a Bullet

Han Xueming, also known as Xiao Qizi, a native of Funing, residing at Xin Goubang, Tongren Street, Xujiahui, Shanghai, in a gate-less house, was 31 years old. He possessed considerable potential influence. This spring, he was detained by the French police on suspicion of theft and was released only last month. The day before yesterday (the 2nd), Han held a grand memorial feast at the Tongxing Hall on Haig Road, Xujiahui, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of his father's death, sending out many invitations. Around 11 o'clock that night, after the guests dispersed, Han hurried back home. Unexpectedly, as he reached the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Haig Road, a hidden assassin ambushed him in the darkness. The assassin followed him from behind, pulled out a gun, and fired several shots at his head in quick succession. Two bullets hit him in the head on the spot, piercing his left temple. His brains splattered, and he collapsed. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the assassin immediately fled with the weapon, disappearing without a trace. Immediately after the incident, the Japanese authorities blocked traffic at the scene and conducted a thorough search, but to no avail. Yesterday morning, the body was examined and then carried by relatives to the nearby Continental Funeral Home for embalming. It is rumored that the murder was caused by an uneven distribution of spoils. It is said that Han had worked as an investigator at a certain gambling den last year.

### From Selling Buildings by Units to Rent Increases

— Bao Xu

Suddenly, a disturbance arose in the quiet lane. It turned out that the landlord had come up with a new trick: selling buildings by units for 8,400 yuan each—actually selling the right to live there for 14 years, calculated at the current rent of 50 yuan per month, totaling 8,400 yuan.

Wishful Thinking Reveals Your True Colors

Is the price of 8,400 yuan reasonable? Of course not. First, the landlord deliberately ignored interest. According to the interest rate and method of "fixed deposit lump sum withdrawal installment" savings deposit at the Bank of China, as long as you deposit a little more than 5,000 yuan now, you can withdraw 50 yuan per month from the bank, including principal and interest, for the next 14 years. Moreover, the market interest rate is higher than the bank deposit rate. Second, according to the provisions of the Civil Code, the lessor has the obligation to repair the leased property. It can be seen that the current rent must include repair costs. Therefore, if the landlord wants to sell the right to live there, this part of the repair costs should be deducted from the sale price. Third, a one-time payment saves the landlord a lot of trouble, so the sale price should be reduced. This is the same principle that wholesale prices should be lower than retail prices.

The second landlords in the entire lane refused to be outdone and held a general mobilization meeting to discuss the matter. Of course, most of the clear-headed second landlords strongly opposed it, but there were also a few "wealthy fools" who "generously" bought it without thinking, because this was the only way to show their "wealth."

Consideration of the Situation and Rent Increases

After several rounds of negotiation, the landlord was finally able to "consider the situation" and agreed to withdraw the order. However, he then made a new request: a 50% rent increase! The reasons were sufficient:

1. Due to the high rise in housing prices, the monthly rent of 50 yuan, after deducting depreciation, is less than 4% annual interest, which is too low!

2. The currency is too…

Self-deception and specious so-called "reasons" can convince anyone? Regarding the first point, due to the natural increase in property value, the landlord has already reaped a huge windfall without any effort. If interest is to be added to this windfall, it would be too ruthless, wouldn't it? Therefore, in addition to the obligation to pay the natural appreciation tax on real estate to the government, the landlord has no reason to demand a rent increase. Regarding the second point, it is clear that the landlord does not understand the facts. It should be known that the value of currency and prices are mutually causal. The decline in currency value certainly makes prices soar, but the rise in prices also makes currency value fall. Therefore, to avoid the continued decline in currency value, the only way is to control the rise in prices. Therefore, the decline in currency value is not a sufficient reason for a rent increase.

30% Discount, Many Troubles

Reason could not defeat the landlord's endless desires. After much effort, a 30% "discount" was obtained, a net rent increase of 30%. Of course, I could no longer protest against this "fait accompli," but I hope that this "discount on rent increase" is not like a certain lane on Lafayette Road, which came from bribing the bookkeeper.

The rent has increased, and the disturbance in the lane has subsided, but who can guarantee that there will never be a first disturbance in the future? (Borrowed Reward)

### "Heavy Burden"?

— Xingyun

Carrying a fragrant loaf of bread and walking on the street is always a "dangerous" thing, so I hugged it tightly in my arms, crossed my hands to hold it, and walked with my head down. I was just afraid that a black hand would suddenly come to seize my "lifeline," but it would be a bit embarrassing if classmates or acquaintances saw this "awkward state."

It seemed that "Heaven was not beautiful." I ran into a classmate, a rich man's son, head-on. "Mr. Xing, hello… Eh, why are you holding that bread so tightly? It won't be delicious if it's flattened." "It's hard to say. There are too many loafers on the street. If you're not careful, that bread will surely 'disappear without a trace.'" "Loafers want to rob things?—" He said thoughtfully: "Aren't they afraid of the law?".

"This… I don't know. Fortunately, um, fortunately your brother is a lawyer. You can ask him… I have something to do, I won't keep you company, goodbye." Looking back, he was still thinking quietly.

"Goodbye," he woke up from his "dream." "It's rare that this young master is willing to pay attention to this 'small matter,'" I thought.

Running home, the bread went down my stomach, and I felt relieved, as if a stone in my heart had fallen to the ground with a "thud."

### Speculation Guide, International Physiognomy, Remuneration and Foreign Exchange Calculation, It is Better for You to Talk About the Market

— Li Bao

At five o'clock in the afternoon, another day's work came to an end, and Old Hu was going to visit a first-class recluse in the mountains and forests.

Old Hu has been very trusting of these things lately. I know that he lost money on more than five long positions some time ago. It's really strange! As soon as he loses money, he becomes fond of these things. What he has learned was "taught by a strange person since childhood." It is said that this time he came to Shanghai from Java (?). In fact, his scholarship seems to have reached the "realm of transformation" long ago.

Walking into Room 〇〇〇, ×× Mansion, my vision was refreshed. There was a cash register as soon as I entered the door. Only behind the two doors was the place to talk about physiognomy. It looked somewhat similar to a hospital.

Old Hu took out two yuan, but after the one who collected the money asked for his name, he suddenly said, "Sir, there is an additional handling fee of 30%."

Old Hu turned around and looked at me, as if to say, "They're still playing tricks?"

I didn't say anything and followed Old Hu into the inner suite—the physiognomy room. Naturally, there were a few polite greetings at the beginning, and then we slowly approached the topic. This physiognomist, who didn't have a high nose, began to speak in Chinese: "What kind of physiognomy do you want to talk about, brother? The remuneration here is—look! From ten yuan to a thousand yuan. As you please!"

"Didn't your advertisement say two yuan? I've already paid it outside."

"That's right, that's registration. The rules here are that the physiognomy fee is negotiated in person."

"So expensive!" Old Hu looked at the remuneration list, which I don't know who had set, and said in surprise. This person's tone was a bit teasing:

"Expensive? Not expensive at all! A few days ago, brothers here were all calculating in Hong Kong dollars. Now we've changed to Shanghai money. If we followed the original practice, it would be even more expensive. One dollar would be equal to four yuan, seven dimes and a half in legal currency."

So they didn't talk about physiognomy and started talking about the market. As a result, Old Hu got the most basic ten yuan. The subject was "Brief Discussion on the Passing Years." I don't know how, when the one outside ran over to "ask for the money," he also collected a handling fee of 30%. Old Hu spent fifteen yuan and six dimes in total. What did he get? — "Your face, sir, has a full forehead and a square chin, like the character 'same'. According to the physiognomy, you will never have to worry about food and clothing in your life… However, your seal is dark. Not to flatter you, it seems that you are not very lucky right now… If you get to August or September, you can enter a better state…"

Stepping onto the elevator, Old Hu breathed a sigh of relief. He seemed to have found satisfaction in these rambling Jianghu terms. As for me, I was even more satisfied: I didn't spend a penny and learned about physiognomy.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Although Begonia had never read a single English word and didn't understand what they were saying, she found it very interesting to listen to.

A female student sitting next to Mei Bao suddenly saw Begonia through the glass window and secretly winked at Mei Bao. Mei Bao quickly turned her head and gave a shy and happy smile towards the window.

"Mei Bao, it's me?" He almost wanted to shout that out.

When Mei Bao turned her face to look at him a second time, Begonia's face was pressed tightly against the glass window.

"Wu Meiying?" Just as the two of them were watching each other longingly through the window, the teacher on the platform suddenly shouted this name loudly, which made Begonia almost want to hide away immediately, while also fearing that doing so would make the teacher blame his beloved daughter.

"No one can say it completely. Why don't you tell me?" The teacher put on a very gentle smile, apparently he had not yet discovered Begonia outside the window. Even if he had discovered it, he had no intention of blaming Meiying.

"Shall, will auxiliary verb, receive, find, transitive verb; talk, smile, intransitive verb; snows, rains, impersonal verb," Mei Bao stood up from her seat and rattled off many English words, which sounded like a little foreigner to Begonia's ears. "Very good, sit down?" The teacher waved his hand, telling Mei Bao to sit down, and said to the other students: "Wu Meiying is really the most hardworking student, so she always gets first place on every exam. You are all about to graduate, and you still can't say all four types of verbs completely. Everyone is older than Wu Meiying, so why is no one as good as her?" (149)

### Reflections After Movie Stars Go to War

— Qing Hui

Charles Boyer was the first movie star to actually participate in the war in this European war. Now, although he has returned to the studio and continues to work, the general public does not know the details of his participation in the war. It was not until recently that a detailed record was seen in Silver Screen magazine. The translation is as follows:

Going to France to Film

After Charles Boyer finished filming "All This, and Heaven Too" in Hollywood, he went to France at the request of the film company to film "LeCarsair". At that time, the war had not yet broken out, but the situation was extremely tense, and the war clouds were overwhelming, with a touch-and-go situation. His relatives and friends all advised him not to go to Europe for the time being, and to wait for the evolution of the European situation before deciding whether to go or not. However, he felt that it was a very meaningful thing to return home to make a film, so he resolutely left the United States for France amidst the tense situation. When the filming was halfway through, the situation in Europe became increasingly tense. His new film was being filmed on the banks of the Nile. Seeing the situation becoming more tense, he sent his wife to her mother's house, which was safer, and then he returned to the city of Nile alone to continue filming his new film.

Conscripted into the Army

On the night the war broke out, France launched a very extensive national general mobilization. Because of this, filming work had to be stopped. Since Boyer was also a French citizen, he had to return to the city of Figeac (his hometown) to await conscription. In less than a day, the national general mobilization reached him; so Boyer joined the army and was assigned to the 37th Artillery Regiment. However, shortly after joining the army, he was sent to the city of Yuxiong for initial training. At that time, France was fully defending the Maginot Line. So, after a short period of training, he followed the whole team to the front to defend the Maginot Line.

Army Life

When their companions discovered that he was the "Napoleon of the Silver Screen," a movie star, they made various taunts. "Look!" the artillerymen said, "It's little Napoleon! Isn't it? Heavens! He's become so terrible, so pathetic! Ha! That great Mr. Napoleon is now only fit to be a groom." This seemed to slap Boyer in the face. To those companions, it was just said casually and there was no particular malice, but Boyer was filled with unhappiness when he heard it. However, because discipline was strict in the army and partners were not supposed to quarrel, he had to turn a deaf ear. Indeed, the Napoleon who had dominated the silver screen had lost his prestige at that time.

Return to the Studio

Just as he was enduring humiliation and fighting hard against the enemy, an order came: it said that under the current situation in France, people over 40 were not needed in the army, and Boyer was already 42 years old, exceeding the age of military service, so he had to leave the army and return to the studio to pursue his old career. Although he lived in a foreign country, he still missed his homeland very much. He once told reporters: "Ah! The scenery of Paris is so memorable, but when the artillery fire sounded, the bombs fell straight from the sky, the beautiful and peaceful fields were shattered, and huge armies were killed in the retreat, with no one spared. Tens of thousands of homeless people and refugees were running around like frightened beasts. Unless they were so tired that they fell asleep, everyone was silent. That kind of tragic situation will never be forgotten. Now I am still preparing my blue-gray military uniform, ready to join the Free French Army, whether it is to drive a horse, dig trenches, or be used as Nazi cannon fodder, I am waiting for any fate. Because no matter what, I am still a free Frenchman!"

### Blood Rain in Qiong Yuan (A Novel)

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 12:  Utter Helplessness Like Ning Wu

Madam Liu was also the daughter of a military family. Her jade-like face was pure and beautiful, and she had some knowledge of martial arts. She was the same age as Zhou Yuji. In the past, she had ridden alongside Zhou Yuji on hunts, wearing a sword and carrying a bow, resembling a valiant female general. She very much wanted to follow her husband to fight the bandits, but Zhou Yuji firmly instructed her to serve his mother and take on the responsibilities of a son, so she could not fulfill her wish. After the mother and son, husband and wife, and father and son met and exchanged greetings, the old lady rubbed her old eyes and carefully looked at Zhou Yuji's face and body before saying, "My son, why have you returned instead of defending Daizhou?" Zhou Yuji was startled upon hearing this, realizing that his mother did not yet understand the reason. However, as the matter could not be concealed, he glanced at Madam Liu and briefly explained that the bandits had broken through Daizhou and he had retreated to defend Ningwu. Madam Liu hurriedly apologized to her mother-in-law. The old lady nodded and said, "So that's how it is. Of course, you must be loyal to the country and protect the region. However, the bandits are rampant and should not be underestimated." Zhou Yuji said, "Our forces are far outnumbered; our troops are truly too few. I have requested assistance from the imperial court and sent people to General Jiang Rang in Datong to request reinforcements, but there has been no news, and not a single soldier has arrived. Daizhou has already been captured. I fear this pass will be difficult to hold for long. I would have no regrets to die for the country, but I am full of worries and anxieties because I cannot protect my white-haired mother. I wish to send my son to accompany you to a neighboring province or prefecture to seek temporary refuge for a while, to avoid suffering terror here in vain. I wonder what my mother thinks?" After listening to her son's words, the old lady sighed and said, "I heard that the mother of Wang Ling was able to teach her son to achieve fame. How can I, in my twilight years, cling to the last rays of the setting sun and fail to help my son become a loyal and good person? The ancient saying goes, 'Complete loyalty cannot coexist with complete filial piety.' At this time of imminent war, you have a duty to defend the territory. Go and wholeheartedly kill the bandits. Do not be attached to your old mother. If you die in battle, your name will be remembered in history, and the Zhou family will also have glory. If Ningwu cannot be defended, I am willing to die here rather than flee far away to live on in disgrace. I will tell you what the ancients said: During the Eastern Jin Dynasty, Su Jun was tyrannical and launched a military rebellion. At that time, the official Bian Hu was loyal and unyielding, and he fought Su Jun alone with his sword under the palace gate and died. Bian Hu's sons and wife all followed him in martyrdom." (106)

### Comments on "The Proposal" and "Gilding"

— Qingxin

"The Proposal" and "Gilding," which have been widely publicized in the theater world for a long time, have been performed hastily. These are two comedies, so the audience laughed continuously during the performance, and the audience was overwhelmed with laughter.

"The Proposal" is a one-act play. Although it is so short, it describes the society's snobbery and shallow views and the greed of local tyrants and evil gentry in every detail. Indeed, in an occasion of "valuing clothes over people", today a lot of misers have been produced, who often put their property on the neck collar to live on; As for Li Shouzhen, after knowing Zhao Baogui's intentions, he was so anxious and helpless, which is totally childish. But there is still one thing to be considered, here, Li Erye pretended to have leg pain, but after hearing Zhao Baogui's statement of his intention, he jumped up without turning around, which seems to be a bit too straightforward. As for the two disabled characters in the play - Zhao Baogui (cripple) Li Shouzhen (hunchback), in terms of technology, they have made considerable gains.

"Gilding" is a two-act comedy, adapted by the famous playwright Cao Yu. It describes the foolishness of Dr. Ma Shouqing, who has no ability. (Writing Western cuisine names on prescriptions, isn't that a joke?) As for the family property, from furniture to everything else, it belongs to others; And he even hired people to pretend to be patients to cover up the bleak scene of few visitors, and even shamelessly bragged, with a bank manager in his mouth, and a big man upright, this situation is not uncommon in today's isolated island. When the two families visited relatives, both sides were people who "pretended to be rich", and as a result, they were all exposed, and the good thing almost turned into a tragedy. Fortunately, Zhao Ershu's quick talk and teaching them is really the right medicine for modern people who like to be extravagant and unrealistic. In terms of actors' skills, Han Fei, who has always appeared in front of the audience as a pretty boy, actually played an old man who was neither new nor old this time, which is really interesting. And Bai Li's role as Mrs. Ma is also very natural, which is worth mentioning; Mu Hong's role as an Indian is very realistic in terms of posture and costume, so that people can hardly believe that he is a Chinese man. Others, Zhao Wenming, played by Tianran, is very much like a prodigal son, but in terms of movements, it is always better to tend to be natural. If he achieves this, he is guaranteed that his future will reveal a glimmer of dawn.

### Random Talks on "Martial Actors" on Shanghai Stages (2)

— Sui Jingchun

Gao Xueqiao: Gao Xueqiao, the brave martial actor of Tianchan, has a good relationship with people inside and outside the troupe. He has been performing on the stage for the longest time. I still remember that when Gao Ling first came to Shanghai, he was on the old Gongwu Stage in Zhengjia Muqiao, hanging the first sign and arranging the new play "Big Knife Wang Wu", which caused a sensation. Judging from his martial arts skills, he has a solid foundation. The play "Driving Chariot General" is his masterpiece. One-Branch Plum in "Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes" and Tianba in "Golden Dart Huang Tianba" are very suitable for his identity, so his reputation is growing day by day, and he is deeply valued by the authorities. Recently, Song Baoluo performed the full version of "Wu Xianghou", Xueqiao went to Jiang Wei's role, magnificent, side style is very good, it seems that Yang Ruiting in the winter last Sunday once performed "Tielong Mountain" to go to this role is better, because Gao Ling is in his prime of life.

Liang Huichao: Liang Huichao is now re-affiliated with the Gengxin Stage. His art is becoming more and more sophisticated. Both short and long dramas are in accordance with the rules and regulations, and there is absolutely no atmosphere of the Waijiang School. Ma Chao in "Jiameng Pass", I think he played the best. "Golden Leopard" is his masterpiece, but playing a certain role of Sun Wukong will inevitably be reduced in color. The so-called peony is good, but it still needs green leaves to support it. The various roles he has played in "New Journey to the West" are also highly praised by the audience.

Zhang Yipeng: Zhang Yipeng has the elegant name of "Living Monkey", but at present, there is not only Yipeng who can perform monkey dramas. Wang Guiqing is also good. The depth of his skills and the lifelike expression are difficult to match. The name of "Living Monkey" is indeed not an exaggeration, and he deserves it. "Siping Mountain", "Yaguan Tower", "Wu Song", and "Taking Beihuzhou by Wisdom" are all very interesting. In recent years, Zhang has been in a high position and will not do anything unless he is the main character. It is rumored that his relationship with his father, Gai Jiaotian, has always been cold, but evidence from his recent visits to see his father's illness in the past two months shows that Yipeng is filial.
