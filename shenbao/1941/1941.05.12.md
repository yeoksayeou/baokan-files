### Pan-American Representatives to Meet the Day After Tomorrow; Roosevelt to Deliver Speech

Elaborating on Foreign Policy and the "Protect America Committee" Urges Effective Aid to China

Washington - It is expected that President Roosevelt will deliver a major speech on U.S. foreign policy when he addresses the Latin American mission to the United States on Wednesday. According to well-informed congressional sources, the President's speech will clarify current issues and explain the extent to which the United States will go to ensure the safe delivery of aid to Britain. For this reason, government leaders have decided to postpone expressing their views on the convoy issue in the Senate. (Reuters, 11th)

New York - The New York Times reports that President Roosevelt's position on the convoy issue will be clear when he addresses the Pan American Union on the 14th of this month. With Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of the Navy Knox having already publicly declared their support for convoys, President Roosevelt cannot avoid expressing his own opinion on this matter. (Havas, date unspecified)

Washington - White House Secretary O'Leary stated yesterday that President Roosevelt's temperature is normal, but he must continue to rest under strict medical guidance and cannot meet with the Latin American naval representatives currently in the United States, which he deeply regrets. (United Press, 11th)

Washington - The issue of naval convoys for shipping supplies to Britain, and whether U.S. naval convoys are equivalent to entering the war, is being widely debated in local and national newspapers. Isolationists, pro-government factions, and those primarily supporting all-out aid to Britain have been holding meetings to discuss the matter. It is expected that a concrete decision on this matter will be made within a few weeks. Editorials in most newspapers support the recent speeches by the four key government officials on aid to Britain and believe that the purpose of these speeches is to arouse public opinion to facilitate the government's adoption of proactive measures regarding the European situation. President Roosevelt's illness and lack of communication with reporters for the past two weeks have further fueled speculation, and there is much conjecture about what he will say to the press next week. President Roosevelt's upcoming speech to the Latin American Association is also subject to much speculation. Some reporters believe that even if the situation worsens, the United States will not formally enter the war, and Germany does not want to formally declare war on the United States because the United States could then adopt a full wartime system, accelerate production, and take even more aggressive measures. This was the reason why the United States was able to defeat Germany in the past. Currently, newspapers here, regardless of party affiliation, unanimously advocate adopting a convoy system, regardless of the consequences, but several major newspapers still support the isolationist position. They uniformly highlight the anti-convoy remarks of Lindbergh, Wheeler, and Nye. A reporter from a Midwestern newspaper told a reporter from the Central News Agency that the opinions of isolationists opposing intervention in the European war zone are gradually moving toward supporting Roosevelt's diplomatic policy. As for whether they support naval convoys alone or all-out support for democratic countries, he said that once the President announces his decision to the nation, the general public will support it. The National Committee to Defend America released a declaration on the 7th, advocating that the United States immediately declare a state of emergency and use its naval and air forces to defend the lifeline of transportation between the Western Hemisphere and the United States. The committee also advocated providing effective aid to China, implementing a blockade against Japan, and declaring the United States' determination to defend Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, freezing Axis assets in the United States, and forming a global permanent peace with all its might. Yesterday, the committee passed a resolution advocating that the United States also use its naval and air forces to protect supplies bound for countries resisting aggression in the most effective way possible, ensuring that these supplies reach their destinations. In addition, the "Fight for Freedom Committee" also issued a declaration taking a more aggressive stance, stating that, "We have already joined the war, therefore, the United States should immediately declare a state of emergency and immediately use naval power to transport food and weapons to the fighters of the democratic bloc, while severing diplomatic relations with all aggressor countries." (Special Dispatch, 10th)

New York - The Seafarers International Union yesterday approved a condition for a cargo ship to cross the Pacific Ocean: that war bonuses be retroactively paid if ship fares allow for it in the future. The union's demand for voyages to dangerous areas is a bonus of US$2 per day for seafarers, and a bonus of US$50 per person for each port call at the mouth of the Yangtze River or the Gulf of Aden. This demand will delay the departure of the Luchenbach, Sea Witch, and McKeesport, the former two bound for the Far East and the latter for Australia. (United Press, 11th)

Washington - According to the statement made yesterday by Maritime Commission Chairman Land to the Senate Commerce Committee, American sailors or coast guard personnel may be sent to board foreign ships confiscated by the United States, fly their original flags, and sail into non-war zones. Land stated that some foreign ships, if flying their national flags, can be chartered to travel at sea with lights off. Senator Vandenberg asked, "Do you believe that ships can fly foreign flags and travel at sea under the supervision of American sailors?" Land replied, "This is possible." (Reuters, 11th)

### U.S. Opinions on British Shipping Losses Increasingly Divided

Washington - The British Admiralty's release of merchant shipping loss figures for April has sparked a serious reaction here. Public opinion on this issue is becoming increasingly divided. According to political figures, those supporting the government are now trying to push public opinion to ensure that the government makes a decision on sending warships to escort vehicles to Britain as soon as possible. However, according to the figures released by the British Admiralty, the country's merchant shipping losses in April were only 301,070 tons, the lowest figure in the past eleven months, and most of them were sunk by the enemy in the Mediterranean. If this is the case, then this fact does not seem to be sufficient to justify the decision on the convoy method. These political figures acknowledge that Britain's monthly losses of this magnitude have greatly reduced the number of merchant ships available to Britain. As the U.S. shipbuilding program will not be able to reach its peak, it is necessary to find ways to maintain the existing tonnage. Unfortunately, the British Admiralty's communiqué is vague, causing American public opinion to become apprehensive. Under these circumstances, the U.S. government should clearly provide an explanation to ensure that the entire country unanimously decides to assist Britain with the U.S. fleet. For example, "The Washington Daily News" stated, "The British Admiralty admits that the situation in the Atlantic has also improved. Therefore, the focus of the problem is the heavy losses of British merchant ships in other areas, but not those carrying American military equipment in the Atlantic. If so, isn't this in fact contrary to the general American argument that military ships should be used to escort military equipment to Britain?" (Havas, 11th)

Washington - The British shipping loss figures released in London yesterday arrived here too late, and newspapers did not have time to comment on them, but printed them in large print, leaving a deep impression on readers. A radio commentator said that the British side did not want to publish these figures immediately, but was forced to release them early due to pressure from the American situation. Senator Vandenberg's British shipping loss figures released on Wednesday, which implied limited British shipping losses in the Atlantic war, were cited by isolationists as proof that the United States does not need to continue to take action at sea. Now that it is known that Vandenberg's figures are incomplete, the British side's release of this truth will definitely be helpful to the U.S. Congress. (Reuters, 11th)

### Million American Youths Called to Register

Washington - Draft officials yesterday completed a notice calling for the registration of approximately one million young men who have reached their 21st birthday. This is the first time since registration in October last year. The notice is now awaiting President Roosevelt's signature. President Roosevelt will decide on the registration date, which is expected to be in July. (United Press, 11th)

### U.S. Government Continues to Announce Types of Embargoed Goods

State Department Will Request Congressional Authorization to Extend Export Licensing System to the Philippines

Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday ordered that, effective June 3, the following items be included under the export license system: Phaeosperma leaves (pharmaceuticals), Mentha arvensis (plant), vanadium, tantalum (both metallic elements), fluorite pillars (minerals), chemical wood flour, and Schizostylis (plant) seeds. (United Press, 11th)

Washington - Authoritative sources say that the State Department will soon ask Congress to authorize President Roosevelt to extend the export license system to the Philippines to prevent the shipment of chromium, manganese, hemp, and coconut oil to Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union. The State Department believes that this measure is also a matter of national defense. These special goods are currently being shipped to Vladivostok in large quantities, and the government believes that their final destination is Germany. Once the export license system is implemented in the Philippines, important exports will be subject to strict control, and export licenses will not be granted for military raw materials suspected of being shipped to Germany. As for licenses for Japan and the Soviet Union, they will be strictly restricted. If the Soviet Union and Japan provide the United States with various economic and political conveniences on time, the United States will provide limited supplies to the Soviet Union and plug this loophole in the blockade line. Britain has long hoped for this, and the State Department's decision was made after consultation with the War Department. (International News Service, 11th)

### San Francisco Bay Area Machinists Strike; Affects National Defense Orders

New York - The tide of national defense industry is becoming more uneasy. Nineteen hundred machinists in the San Francisco Bay Area are on strike, affecting national defense orders worth US$500 million, including four cruisers and twenty-seven destroyers. Although Secretary of the Navy Knox has loudly appealed to everyone to consider the importance of their work and to work as usual, the machinists have ignored him. Because these machinists are important, if the strike lasts until next week, it will make it impossible for another 25,000 shipbuilding machinists to work. Currently, there are a total of twenty-five strikes in various national defense industries, all small-scale strikes, with a total of 35,000 strikers. In addition, 61 manufacturing plants of General Motors Corporation are still threatened by strikes. 165,000 workers are demanding a wage increase of US$0.10 per hour. The company is undertaking national defense orders worth US$75 million. President Roosevelt may have to step in and submit the matter to public judgment. (United Press, 11th)

### U.S. Ambassador Gauss Passes Through Japan to China; Will Attend Meeting in Singapore with Key Figures from China, the Philippines, Australia, the Netherlands, Burma

Gauss is scheduled to go to Shanghai tonight. (Reuters, 11th)

### New Japanese Ambassador Kato Arrives in France

Vichy - The new Japanese Ambassador to France, Kato, arrived here at 5:00 PM today. Marshal Petain's representative, Bauffre, greeted him at the station. Kato immediately met with reporters, made a statement, and strongly affirmed the friendly relations between France and Japan, saying that he firmly believes that although France is encountering unprecedented national difficulties, under the leadership of Marshal Petain, it will be able to revive and will certainly contribute to the work of establishing a new order and lasting peace in Western Europe. As for the various issues related to Vietnam, especially the French-Japanese economic negotiations, they have all been satisfactorily resolved. (Havas, 10th)

### German Newspaper Criticizes Roosevelt

London - German radio said that the Berlin People's Front criticized President Roosevelt, pointing out that the North American president bears even more responsibility than Churchill. Judging from the documents found in Poland, one can see what kind of pressure Roosevelt's confidant Bullitt placed on the hesitant Chamberlain, forcing him to adopt an encirclement policy. This kind of pressure was especially evident after the Munich Conference. Therefore, it was the U.S. president and his promise of aid to Britain that made the war inevitable. Without the U.S. president, Churchill would never have been appointed prime minister. (Reuters, 11th)

Rome - The Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia declared today that the U.S. government has decided to go to war with the Axis powers. The newspaper called on the American people to oppose this decision, otherwise they should bear part of the responsibility for the final outcome. At the same time, the Italian press and officials firmly believe that the U.S. is now heading towards a de facto war. (International News Service, 11th)

### Vietnam Has Become an Axis Nation; A Latent Arsenal in the Far East

Fifty German Experts Depart for Vietnam; Economic Matters Will Be Controlled by Japan

London - It was learned yesterday from reliable sources that since the signing of the economic treaty on May 6 and the political treaty on May 9, Vietnam has actually become a dependency of Japan. The treaty of May 9 is a supplement to the treaty signed on September 23 last year. Washington protested against the treaty signed last year. The Vichy government has guaranteed that it will not participate in any agreement that conflicts with Japan's development. According to the aforementioned treaties, Japan has been able to import its main goods into Vietnam duty-free. Japanese investments in Japanese industries can be recognized as having the same status as French capital industries, including agriculture and mining. Industrial conferences will be held at any time, at which time Japan will decide to adjust and control all economic matters. Thereafter, financial measures will be based on the Japanese yen. Furthermore, a German technical team is rushing to this latent Axis arsenal in the Far East. Fifty experts left Berlin for Vietnam on May 8. (International News Service, 11th)

Editorial

### Current Phase of U.S.-Japan Relations

With the rapidly changing European situation, U.S. convoys are inevitable. Recalling that when the Lend-Lease Act was being discussed in the U.S. Congress in February, convoys were prohibited and even listed as one of the provisions. In a short time, there has been a significant shift in opinion in both the government and the public. It can be seen that the issue of U.S. participation in the war, as pointed out in yesterday's editorial in this newspaper, is at least 50% mature, and its realization is only a matter of time. The expansion of the war is not a welcome event, but at a time when the crime of aggression threatens all of humanity, what should be most condemned is not war, but the aggressor's conquest of the world without a fight. Even if we speculate towards the worst future, at the very least, the futures of Greece and the Netherlands are more promising than those of Denmark and Romania.

In terms of the recent situation, it is clear that the situation on the other side of the Atlantic is causing the United States greater concern. Whether it is convoys or participation in the war, both are directly aimed at the Axis powers. Up to this point, the U.S. authorities have not revealed what steps they will take regarding their allies after an open break with Germany and Italy. The Nazi forces indeed laid a chess piece in the Far East as early as September last year to contain the United States. This used to be sensational, but it has gradually faded with the passage of time. Recently, some Japanese have indeed spoken of their determination to fulfill their Axis obligations to the United States, and it even came from the mouth of a Foreign Ministry spokesperson; however, amidst all the complex arguments about adjusting U.S.-Japan relations, such as Matsuoka's visit to the United States and Roosevelt and Hull's visit to Japan, there is clearly a sense of loneliness. There is no need to discern whether there is sincerity or pretense, nor to delve into whether it is a test. It can be seen that Japan's concern about the movements on the other side of the Pacific is just as anxious as its inability to end the "China Incident."

Recently, Japanese public opinion has suddenly emphasized the view that Japan cannot conquer China by force. Guangzhi Bao and others have even gone further and considered ways to end the "China Incident." The fact that China cannot be conquered by force is a fact that has long been recognized by the world, and even Japanese officials and the public have repeatedly expressed their recognition of the truth of this understanding. Recently, Honda Kumatarō, who was stationed in Nanjing by Japan, vehemently criticized the Japanese side's advocacy of "direct negotiations" before returning to Japan. One can see that there are currently some disputes among the Japanese side about how to "resolve the China Incident." The opinions suggested by Guangzhi Bao are probably the targets opposed by Honda. From this, it can be seen that the germination of the so-called peace offensive has already formed a problem in Japan. The actual effect of this is not much to be argued, and is probably just like the criticism from Washington, just expressing Japan's one-sided desire. However, its germination at a time when it is fully focused on the United States can at least prove that the current Japanese authorities' views on China and the United States are like two intersecting straight lines, and it is now trying to grasp the intersection of the two lines in one fell swoop.

Tokyo's sudden activity regarding the attitude of the United States is not only stimulated by the Soviet-Japanese Treaty, but also by the influence of the international situation. The explanation of this point in the United Press Tokyo news ten days ago is noteworthy. It said that Japan's recent gestures towards the United States are probably based on the report and encouragement of its ambassador to the United States, Nomura, who said that the United States' main concern is in Europe, so resolving the Pacific issue is not hopeless. The same news also said: Japan intends to negotiate a new commercial treaty with the United States to replace the abolished old treaty. Some people believe that this can only be done if Japan makes considerable concessions to China. These are generally fantasies, but they are one of the main reasons why the Japanese side suddenly launched a peace offensive at this time. The other day, Matsuoka expressed his determination to use diplomatic means to "resolve the China Incident," while China and Foreign Commercial News criticized the U.S. for recognizing China as a democratic country as absurd. Comparing the two, the message is not difficult to understand. In short, Japan believes that the United States' attention has been largely drawn to the European war and that it has no intention of taking action in the Pacific for the time being. This is a good opportunity for Japan to implement a peaceful southward advance and a good opportunity to resolve the China Incident. As long as the United States does not interfere or hinder Japan's actions, Japan may not be unable to provide the United States with certain guarantees.

After the Dutch East Indies and Japan signed the oil agreement, London expressed an optimistic view, saying that the situation in the Pacific has unexpectedly improved, and specifically mentioned the special clause in the Tripartite Pact that Japan does not have to participate in the war after the U.S. and Germany go to war. This optimism is dangerous. Of course, the current Japan is quite cautious about the issue of participation in the war and will not make a decision until it is absolutely advantageous, but if the Tripartite Pact really has that secret clause, then it is precisely the basis for Japan to bargain with the democratic countries, which is what its aforementioned fantasy is based on. However, no one believes that the United States' unshakeable position on the Far East is just like China's own unshakeable resistance to aggression. The other day, there were rumors that Britain had used diplomatic means in the Far East, but Eden's powerful statement denying the closure of the Burma Road proves that those rumors are absurd. Britain is unwilling to abandon its obligation to assist Greece in order to avoid its own difficulties, and the United States, which emphasizes ideals more than the British people, will not lightly commit the crime of breaching its trust. There is no need to worry too much about this point, but it is a pity that the Far East has not been able to break the aggressor's tentacles before the European situation became tense. However, although the United States today attaches great importance to Europe, it will not relax its grip on the East. With its inexhaustible power, it is believed that once the storm in the Pacific also fluctuates with the European situation, the United States still holds several powerful and effective weapons in its hands.

### Tens of Thousands of Japanese Troops Invade Border Between Shanxi and Henan; 200,000 Chinese Troops Immediately Respond; General Wei Lihuang Personally Commands the Front Lines; Fierce Battles Have Continued for Days in the Suburbs of Yuanqu and Jiyuan

Luoyang - The situation in Zhongtiao Mountain has become tense due to the Japanese invasion of Yuanqu, and a major battle is about to break out. Tens of thousands of Japanese troops invaded from the Hengling Pass and Gaoluozhen Avenue in the south. Japanese troops from Xiaxian and Qinshui also advanced towards the east and west sides. On the 8th and 9th, fierce battles broke out on all fronts. The Japanese launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army under the cover of intense artillery fire, poison gas, and air force. The Chinese army resisted bravely, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. Currently, due to the terrain in Tanqu, the Chinese army has retreated to a favorable area and continues to engage in fierce battles with the Japanese army. (10th)

Chongqing - A major battle broke out on the border between Shanxi and Henan on the 7th. The Japanese army, numbering tens of thousands, invaded Yuanqu from the various foothills of Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi, while a part invaded Zhiyuan from Wenxian and Mengxian in northern Henan. Their ultimate goal was to cross the Yellow River and invade the western section of the Longhai Railway. The Chinese army was prepared and has mobilized a large force of 200,000 to immediately respond. General Wei Lihuang personally went to supervise the battle. Fierce battles took place in the suburbs of Tanqu and Jiyuan yesterday. The Chinese army's positions along the Yellow River have been completely deployed for many years, making them impregnable. The Japanese army will never succeed. (10th)

Chongqing - Military news, the fighting in the northern region is becoming more and more intense. More than 7,000 Japanese troops around Fenyang City to the outskirts of Jiyuan have been largely reinforced and invaded Jiyuan City on the afternoon of the 8th. Japanese troops from Mengxian continued to invade Beibaiban on the afternoon of the 8th. On the same day, at dusk, the two Japanese troops joined forces to invade Fengmenkou. The Chinese army launched a fierce attack with subsequent troops joining in the Xichengliu area. As of the 9th, the Chinese and Japanese troops were still fighting fiercely in the area east of Fengmenkou. The Japanese troops invading along the Henggao Avenue were strongly blocked by the Chinese, and suffered heavy casualties. On the 8th, the Japanese army continued to use aircraft to bomb all day and released a large amount of smoke screen, and the Chinese army was forced to transfer. The Japanese army was able to invade Yuanqu. Now the Chinese and Japanese armies are still fighting fiercely in the mountainous area of Banjian River to the west of Yuanqu. About 3,000 Japanese troops near Dangyang invaded Yuanan in separate groups via Shimachao, Yinzigang, Jiuligang, and Weijiagang on the 7th. After being blocked by the Chinese army, they are still fighting fiercely in the suburbs. The Japanese troops invading Zaolin Township from Qingmiao Town were blocked by the Chinese army and retreated from Taishan Temple to Tangxian Town. The Japanese troops from Tangwangdian continued to invade Baijiazhuang and Liujiagang. After being bravely counterattacked by the Chinese army, hundreds were killed and wounded. Currently, they are in a fierce battle. Another Japanese army invaded Jingmingpu from Taishan Temple and was intercepted by the Chinese, and the Japanese failed to succeed. A part of the Japanese army in Suixian invaded Lishan in the north on the morning of the 8th and is fighting fiercely with the Chinese army. (10th)

Chongqing - According to sources close to this, the Japanese army, totaling at least three divisions, has concentrated in southern Shanxi and northern Henan, apparently intending to cross the Yellow River. If the Japanese army actually crosses the river, it will be the first time since the start of the Sino-Japanese War. According to reports, the Japanese army may attempt to cross the river near Mengxian, which is about twenty miles northeast of Luoyang and is a famous shallow crossing. However, the Japanese army may also cross the river near Sishui, about thirty miles west of Zhengzhou. In addition, there seems to be a development indicating that the Japanese army may advance towards Hancheng Town, sixty miles north of Tongguan. Currently, the Japanese army is attacking the Chinese army's positions in Zhongtiao Mountain in southern Shanxi and the towns in northern Henan north of the Yellow River, apparently intending to consolidate the rear before crossing the river.

### Air Raid on Chongqing Causes Minimal Damage

Chongqing The first week of bombing in Chongqing has revealed very few casualties and extremely minor property damage so far. The downtown area of Chongqing is almost entirely undamaged. More importantly, the number of attacking Japanese planes is fewer than last year and even two years ago. Last week's Japanese bombing seemed to be concentrated in the western suburbs. Although a few bombs fell on the downtown commercial area on May 3, the downtown area along the Yangtze River on the 9th, and the north bank of the Jialing Estuary yesterday, most of the bombs from the three bombings fell in the western suburbs. During the air raids on Friday and Saturday, bombs fell near the residence of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and the house was so badly damaged that it was almost uninhabitable. Because the houses in the western suburbs are scattered, most of the bombs fell in open spaces. Except for the shops and houses on the main roads, the damage to other houses was minimal, and the number of casualties was also very limited. Only in the bombing on May 9, many bombs fell along the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers, causing the deaths of many boatmen. When Japanese planes attacked last year and two years ago, Chinese fighter planes took off to fight back, but this year no fighters have been seen taking off to intercept. The Chinese defense relies entirely on anti-aircraft fire, which is not very effective because the Japanese planes are mostly at an altitude of over 70 feet. Air-raid shelters have also been very effective. Although a few bombs directly hit the side of the shelters yesterday, and the entrance was almost blocked, all the people taking refuge were unharmed. After the air raid, everyone left the shelters and returned home without any difficulty. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

### Center of European War Shifts to Eastern Mediterranean; All Aegean Islands Occupied by Axis Powers; Britain Appoints New Commander to Deal with Changes

New York According to the "New York Times," German troops on the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea are now preparing to shift the war to Syria. British troops stationed in Palestine and Transjordan are preparing for the possibility of being attacked from the rear after the German troops establish a base in Syria. Britain has now dispatched more aircraft and light vessels to Cyprus to deal with the German troops in Syria. (TASS dispatch, 11th)

Jerusalem It has been officially announced that General Wilson, who previously commanded British troops in Libya and Greece, is now in charge of British troops in Palestine and Transjordan. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

Rome The semi-official Italian newspaper "Il Giornale d'Italia" recently stated that all the small Greek islands in the Aegean Sea have been occupied by the Axis powers, and the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean has been completely changed.

### Soviet Union's Attitude Unfathomable; Sooner or Later Involvement Inevitable; Based on Its Own Interests and Ideology; Rumors of Meeting Between German and Soviet Leaders Soon

London The "Times" diplomatic correspondent stated that Moscow's cancellation of recognition of the embassies of Belgium, Norway, and Yugoslavia at this time is likely due to two reasons: (1) Stalin's appointment as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, taking over the reins of power, means that he may participate in important diplomatic talks soon, given the emergency situation. These diplomatic talks can only be with Germany. In order to clear the barriers between the Soviet and German nations, Stalin has removed major diplomatic obstacles. (2) The recent actions may be a broad hint to the British government, as Britain has not yet recognized the Soviet Union's annexation of several Baltic countries. The Soviet Union considers this to be a major obstacle to improving British-Soviet relations. The "Times" reporter in the Swedish capital commented on Stalin's assumption of the premiership, saying that at a time when Europe is at war, Stalin's position gives him greater power to issue orders than as leader of the Communist Party. Stalin's assumption of the premiership has given him control of two important levers to deal with any eventuality. Stalin's "promotion" can be seen as reflecting his view that the Soviet Union's participation in the war is not unlikely, and that he has decided to personally be the true and formal head of a government that administers according to the Stalinist constitution. The question then arises: on which side will the Soviet Union join the war? The answer is that the Soviet Union's participation in the war is not for any side, but for its own interests and ideology. Then, which side will it attack? The answer is that, judging from the borders lined up in Poland and Romania, and other subtle signs, it does not intend to directly attack Britain, and Stalin will not easily do so unless he confirms that war is inevitable. As for whether he will preemptively strike, or allow Hitler to choose the timing and location to attack at his leisure, the "News Chronicle" and the "Daily Herald" both carried news that Hitler is now planning to meet with Stalin. The "News Chronicle" diplomatic correspondent stated that Hitler will propose in this meeting to allow the Soviet Union complete freedom of action in all of Asia, including India and Japan, and to give the Soviet Union an outlet to the Persian Gulf through Iran. The Soviet Union must guarantee that it will not change its current borders in Europe. Economically, Germany will ask the Soviet Union to allow it to purchase large quantities of Soviet raw materials, especially wheat from Ukraine and oil from the Caucasus, in exchange for German machinery and heavy industrial products. Stalin knows that Germany's preparations to attack the Soviet Union are complete. If Hitler's proposal contains appropriate promises to guarantee the Soviet Union's security and expand its influence, it is believed that Stalin will accept it. Otherwise, there is no other way to resolve the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany except to resort to force. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)

London According to the Sunday Dispatch, Hitler met with Stalin on a ship in the Black Sea several weeks ago. Hitler declared that if Germany could not obtain the Soviet Union's cooperation, Germany would attack Ukraine. It is rumored that Stalin is prepared to satisfy Hitler's demands.

### German-Soviet War to Break Out in Summer; U.S. Associated Press Reports Indications

Istanbul During my (self-proclaimed special correspondent for this agency, Peters) two-day tour of Romania, I had conversations with local dignitaries. They predicted that the Soviet-German war would break out in June. Romania's two newest passenger ships, the "Basarabia" and the "Transylvania," have been converted into armed cruisers, equipped with 150-mm guns. Romania has been occupied by Germany for eight months. The country now hopes that the Soviet-German war will lead to the transfer of 750,000 German troops. When I was in Romania, local dignitaries all expressed the belief that the Soviet-German war would break out in June. Some even said that German troops would enter the Soviet cities of Kiev and Odessa on June 15. Others predicted that German troops would be able to occupy Moscow in the summer. A high-ranking source said that the Soviet Union had moved the telephone equipment in Kishinev and had evacuated all metal objects from Bessarabia. When the Soviet people withdrew from the Dniester, they also drove the cattle away with them. I also learned that six German submarines had sailed down the Danube River and concentrated in the Black Sea. The Soviet Union has sent 24 submarines from the North Sea. It is said that German sailors have appeared in the Romanian capital. It is believed that more German ships will arrive in the future. (Associated Press dispatch, 9th)

### Anniversary of German Offensive on the Western Front

The "Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger" stated that Germany's interests related to its survival had been demanded in the past by peaceful means, but were resolutely rejected. Now, after a year of struggle by Germany, it has been recognized by all countries. In addition, the "General Anzeiger" stated that the German troops' crossing of the border and launching an offensive on May 10 last year was a revolutionary act, the purpose of which was entirely to transform Europe, and that Churchill and his ilk were still obsessed and self-righteous, and could only be defeated by this kind of revolutionary action." (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Lyon Today is the first anniversary of the German attack on the Western Front. The "Petit Parisien" newspaper recently published a commentary stating that on this day last year, Germany attacked our country. At this moment, we can only learn a lesson, but we must not be discouraged. Our country's failure was due to years of accumulated problems, and history will make its own judgment. Through this battle, we should understand that the so-called total war can cause popular unrest, damage transportation, and demoralize morale. The spirit of our army has not been defeated, but the mechanized units are coming in a torrent, which cannot be resisted by human power. Fortunately, although our country has been defeated today, it still maintains its honor." (Havas dispatch, 10th)

### Spain Sets Up Cannons to Threaten Gibraltar, Waiting for the Opportunity to Block the Mediterranean; Spanish Administrative Institutions Reformed and Renewed

New York, United Press: According to reliable private European sources, Spain has completed the construction of its defensive lines at Algeciras and Tangier. The cannons installed are aimed at the Mediterranean Sea, ready to block the Strait of Gibraltar at any time. However, it is reported that General Franco will not decide to block the western mouth of the Mediterranean unless the German army occupies the Suez Canal and controls the eastern mouth of the Mediterranean.

(United Press dispatch of the 11th)

Madrid: The Spanish political situation has taken a sharp turn, with staunch supporters of the Franco faction suddenly seizing power and assuming important government positions. The reasons for this have not been explained.

However, London watchmen and firefighters still went out to serve. A large bomb fell in the city, injuring several people. Last night, a passenger train on British Railways was strafed by enemy planes, seriously injuring many people. The driver stopped the train and returned to a nearby station to avoid it. The driver later died of his injuries in the hospital. It is reported that four enemy planes were shot down in yesterday's air raid. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

On the same night, both the road east of Tobruk and the road north of Bardia were bombed, damaging the roads and destroying motor transport convoys.

In the above-mentioned battles, the British lost only one plane. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

Cairo: There is no important war news to report in North Africa's Libya, but the British mechanized units are still engaged in active patrols in Sollum.

Cairo: The indoor temperature in Cairo has now reached 111 degrees Fahrenheit, and the heat in the desert suburbs can be imagined. The reason why today's British communiqué stated that there was nothing important to report in the Tobruk area is likely due to this. If the climate in Libya is also like this, the scorching sun will make even tanks almost untouchable. There is currently light rain in Abyssinia, making the roads temporarily muddy and difficult to travel, and the fighting has quieted down slightly. (Reuters dispatch of the 11th)

### France Will Not Abandon Its Mandate Over Syria; Vichy Aviation Minister to Meet with Weygand in North Africa

Vichy: An official spokesperson yesterday denied that France has abandoned its rule over Syria or its League of Nations mandate. According to news from Istanbul, Syrian students held demonstrations celebrating "France's abandonment of its rule over Syria." The news stated that "Syrian students believe that France has no right to rule Syria because France has lost its League of Nations mandate since withdrawing from the League." The spokesperson refuted this, saying that according to League of Nations rules, although France has withdrawn from the League, it still has obligations to the League for two years. Therefore, at least for two years, the mandate should not be a problem. The spokesperson also pointed out that although Japan withdrew from the League long ago, it still has a mandate over the German-owned islands in the Pacific. The French have recently encouraged the new Syrian government to prepare for the establishment of a constitution. (United Press dispatch of the 11th)

### Vichy Promulgates New Law, Strictly Enforcing Anti-Semitism

Vichy: French Head of State Pétain issued an order in today's official gazette, establishing a loan of 2,065,000 francs for the formulation of anti-Jewish laws and for the office expenses of senior officials in charge of Jewish affairs. These Jewish affairs officials have recently been assumed by Vallat, and their office is located in the former Rothschild Bank in Paris. According to news from Paris, the occupying authorities have adopted stricter new measures against Jews in Paris and the occupied provinces, especially against foreign Jews. The means to prohibit Jews from holding various businesses was not mentioned in previous regulations. Influenced by German forces, Vichy is preparing to implement new anti-Jewish laws and has already applied them to recent plans. These new plans will be implemented on May 20th and prohibit Jews from engaging in the following economic activities: (1) wholesale, (2) retail, (3) hotels, (4) restaurants, (5) insurance, (6) advertising, (7) travel, (8) various guidance or transportation industries, including rental cars, (9) pawnbroking, (10) shipping, (11) warehousing, (12) land, sea, and air transportation, (13) banking, (14) exchange business, (15) police or detectives, (16) intelligence agency personnel, (17) tax collection agencies, (18) marriage registration business, (19) rental business, (20) employment agency. However, the news industry is not prohibited. In addition, Jews may not be shop assistants, or engage in agency businesses, or other intermediary businesses related to buying and selling. Furthermore, Jews cannot engage in certain businesses or jobs that can be performed by non-Jews, nor can they work to share profits. According to the new plan, Jews who are dismissed may not request compensation for losses from their employers, and employers may not compensate them. Employers who violate the new plan and compensate dismissed Jews for losses will be severely punished. Positions vacated by Jews should be filled by Aryans. Aryan company authorities may sell or dispose of shares owned by Jews in the company. After Jewish capital is sold or disposed of, Aryan company authorities must not give Jews large sums of money, only allowing them a certain amount of essential living expenses. This new law is stricter than previous laws, because it also stipulates that anyone who converts to Judaism or marries a Jew should be considered Jewish. Anyone whose three generations of ancestors were Jewish is considered a pure Jew, even if the Jew has left Judaism and converted to Christianity, they should still be considered Jewish. In short, this new law has made it impossible for Jews to engage in any economic activities and has reduced the status of Jews to be equal to those working in the fields and factories.

At the same time, President Roosevelt and the American people will not rest until victory is achieved. In her second broadcast, Queen Wilhelmina expressed her gratitude to the English people for their assistance, saying that although Hitler invaded the land of the Dutch people, he could not destroy the spirit of the Dutch people. Even in the occupied areas, there is resistance, with the absolute belief that any negotiations or compromises with the enemy are impossible, because the enemy only knows how to use lies as a tool of its policy and relies on the secret police for its rule.

According to shipping industry sources, the British Taikoo and Jardine ships sailing to Hong Kong will carry Hong Kong rice purchased by the authorities to Shanghai at any time. Currently, in addition to allowing the free export of rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Hong Kong government has implemented a permit system for other merchants purchasing Hong Kong rice. Anyone who does not have this permit is prohibited from exporting it. This measure is to prevent someone from manipulating the market for profit. It is also reported that the Municipal Council's purchase of Hong Kong rice from the Hong Kong government was able to be implemented quickly and smoothly thanks to the shipping industry in this city voluntarily reducing freight rates significantly.

Rice Profiteers' Skills Exhausted, Market Stabilizes

According to general observations, some large hoarders made a final struggle in the rice market last weekend, using the Hong Kong government's control of rice as an excuse to spread rumors, causing the price of rice per picul to be illegally raised by three or four yuan. However, Hong Kong rice has now arrived in Shanghai and is ready for sale. Even if rice profiteers can illegally raise the price of rice, citizens can refuse to buy from them. Moreover, the Hong Kong authorities' control of rice is actually aimed at dealing with rice profiteers and is absolutely beneficial to the supply of rice in this city. Therefore, to this day, all the tricks used by rice profiteers have completely failed. Therefore, the price of rice is bound to continue to fall today, and the rice market will become increasingly stable thereafter, which is undoubtedly the case.

Rice Prices to be Reassessed, Soon to be Implemented

It was previously rumored that the authorities of the two concessions, in order to alleviate the suffering of the common people and maintain social order, would re-evaluate the new price limits for rice on the 10th of this month and implement them effectively. Regardless of domestic or foreign rice, the standard price limit of 110 yuan per picul (160 catties) must not be exceeded from that day onwards. Now, it is again rumored in this city that the new price limit for rice has been postponed due to the low-priced Hong Kong rice not arriving early. However, the emotions of the residents of this city who are eagerly anticipating the authorities to re-establish the new price limit for rice have been evident. It is hoped that the authorities will expedite its implementation.

Price of Foreign Rice Plummets Along with Shanghai

Yesterday, inquiries were made with various foreign rice companies, and it was learned that the price of rice in Saigon, Siam, Yangon and other rice-producing areas had also gradually increased. Because the price of rice in Shanghai was high, the rice merchants there also took the opportunity to raise prices for profit. At that time, rice merchants in this city stopped adding to their supplies due to the high price of foreign rice, which increased costs, causing the price of rice in this city to rise higher and higher. Because the price of rice in Shanghai has plummeted, the price of rice in the above-mentioned rice-producing areas has also fallen one after another. A certain firm received a notice from Yangon the day before yesterday: "The ordered rice has been shipped, and the price of rice continues to plummet." According to another source, the number of ships can gradually increase in the future.

Rice Industry Plan to Reorganize Market Rules

The rice merchant's tea market on Fuzhou Road and the miscellaneous grain and oil cake exchange on Avenue Edward VII have repeatedly adjusted the rice trading rules in the market and strengthened the organizational structure by the relevant industry associations. However, due to the general speculative merchants' insincere compliance and attempts to sabotage, there have been no great results. Market transactions are still quite chaotic and disorganized. Although there are clear regulations, rice profiteers simply ignore them. It is now learned that the rice market management committee and the miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry association, in order to make the market trading under their jurisdiction on the right track, have decided to re-discuss the market rules strictly, with the principle of making it convenient for companies to buy and sell and easy to comply with. They are currently in the process of consultation.

### US Overseas Trade Week Approaching: China and the US Celebrate Together; American Chamber of Commerce to Host Students Studying in America and Hold Impromptu Speeches on Sino-US Relations

The 19th of this month, next Monday, is US Overseas Trade Week. Under the leadership of the American Chamber of Commerce, American expatriates in Shanghai will commemorate "US Overseas Trade Week" during the week of the 19th to the 25th. US authorities have designated the 19th as "International Goodwill Monday." The American Chamber of Commerce and the American Association of expatriates will hold grand celebrations separately.

Holding a Luncheon

However, given the current international situation, authorities do not intend to be extravagant. A luncheon will be held only at the American Clubhouse. As Sino-US relations are becoming increasingly friendly, the American Chamber of Commerce will host Chinese students going to the US this year, accompanied by more than ten students from American schools and their families. A grand banquet will be held that evening to entertain American expatriates in Shanghai. This year, as American expatriates have been ordered to return home one after another, the event will not be as grand as in previous years.

Attendees

US Consul General in Shanghai, Lockhart; Commander of the Yangtze River Fleet, Rear Admiral Glassford; retired Commander of the US Fourth Marine Regiment, Colonel Baker; the new commander, Howard; US Acting Commercial Attaché in China, Mr. Grand; US Assessor in China, Mr. Hamilick; and Mr. Smith of the American Chamber of Commerce will all attend the celebrations and deliver speeches on "Sino-US Relations," chaired by Mr. Smith of the American Chamber of Commerce. At 10:00 AM that morning, a special service will be held at the Grand Theater, presided over by Chaplain Choplin of the Fourth Marine Regiment, with a film screening to add to the occasion.

### Coal Briquette Prices to be Reduced

The price of machine-made coal briquettes once reached a peak. Speculators hoarded existing coal briquettes, raising the factory price to 296 yuan per ton. The retail price was 16 yuan per "dan" (100 market catties). At that time, the black market was still rampant, with coal briquettes exceeding 300 yuan per ton. This has been going on for over a month. According to news from various coal industry associations, the supply of coal dust is now abundant, and market prices are gradually falling, having dropped by more than 30 yuan per ton in recent days. The cost of manufacturing coal briquettes has been reduced, and various machine-made coal briquette factories are preparing to reduce prices. Those holding inventory are uneasy and are scrambling to unload their stockpiles, leading to mutual undercutting. The black market is loosening, and there is hope for a sharp drop in prices in the coming days. Furthermore, the market price of smokeless white coal chunks has also been gradually decreasing. Large quantities of coal chunks are expected to arrive in port sequentially in the middle of this month.

### Latvian Residents Celebrate National Day

Although the national situation is different from the past, Latvian residents in this city will still celebrate the 17th anniversary of the government's founding on the 15th of this month.

Hu Hanmin's Death

Today is the memorial day for the death of Mr. Hu Hanmin, the former President of the Legislative Yuan. Due to the special circumstances, various circles in this city have not held memorial ceremonies since the war, but only spiritual commemorations, recalling Mr. Hu's lifelong dedication to the National Revolution, following the late Premier, braving difficulties, and supporting the Northern Expedition. His perseverance and lifelong words and deeds are truly worthy of being a model for the people. In order to express the admiration of later generations for the virtuous, it is decided to mourn with deep sorrow and devote efforts to Mr. Hu's unfinished legacy, making it shine brightly as a revolutionary model.

Chen Qimei's Martyrdom

May 18th is the memorial day for the martyr Mr. Chen Qimei. In the past, various circles would lower the flag to half-mast and hold gatherings on this day. After the war, due to the circumstances, these gatherings were suspended. However, in order to commemorate Mr. Chen's revolutionary spirit and patriotic enthusiasm, although no extravagant gatherings will be held, it is decided to commemorate this martyr with the same spirit, silently recalling Mr. Chen's lifelong deeds, emulating his perseverance, and dedicating loyalty to the country to strive for the final victory.

### Memorial Service for Commander Xie: Held Yesterday Morning; Limited Number of Attendees, Notice Not Widely Distributed; Hundreds of Representatives from Various Groups Attended

From there to the venue, about fifty steps, both sides were lined with bamboo racks forming a passage, covered with mourning banners and funeral streamers.

### Sharp Drop in Yarn Prices; Loan Collateral Suspended; Fear of Repeating Last Year's Mistakes

Yarn prices have plummeted in recent days, and banks have suspended loans secured by cotton yarn to avoid risk. According to reports from Datong News Agency, there is a large amount of cotton yarn stockpiled in this city, exceeding 300,000 bales. Previously, speculators manipulated the prices, raising them to over 1,500 yuan per bale, with a total value of over 450 million yuan. However, sales to other ports have almost completely ceased, leading to a price decline. Banks are concerned about the cotton yarn's loan, as its selling has greatly narrowed, for fear of repeating last year's mistakes, when yarn prices plummeted from over 1,500 yuan to 800 or 900 yuan, and many yarn stores went bankrupt. The banks deemed the risk of cotton yarn collateral too great. Besides, the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and money is becoming tight. Therefore, they have all suspended loans secured by cotton yarn.

### New Pu Yu Tang Receives Enthusiastic Social Assistance; Over 100,000 Yuan Donated in Four Months; Still Short 90,000 Yuan, Hoping to Accumulate Every Bit

The New Pu Yu Tang in the Nanshi area is a well-known Catholic charity. Since its founding, it has been in operation for 28 years. The hall, located on Guohuo Road, covers an area of over 100 "mu" (over 6.6 hectares), with magnificent buildings and perfect facilities. It is divided into an orphanage, an infant home, and a nursing home, and also provides care for disabled orphans, free medical treatment for the poor and sick, etc. The number of orphans who have been educated and become adults, the elderly and disabled who have enjoyed their old age, and the poor and sick who have benefited from it, are countless. Its contribution to society is self-evident. Recently, due to lack of funds and soaring prices, the hall's current situation is gradually approaching a dead end, especially the food supply, which is difficult to plan. It is likely to affect the continuation of the lives of nearly a thousand orphans and elderly people. Therefore, it is necessary to appeal to all sectors. This newspaper, in fulfilling its social responsibility, is happy to appeal to readers for donations. Fortunately, the enthusiastic response from all sectors has been quite considerable. The hall has prepared a report as follows:

Donation Achievements

Since this newspaper appealed to society on its behalf, donations from all sectors have been very enthusiastic. Some have generously donated large sums of money, some have taken on monthly donations, some have saved money from wedding banquets, birthday banquets, and soup noodle banquets to donate, and some have even donated the funds from dinner parties. Some Westerners have also been moved by sympathy and have generously donated, and have also raised donations from relatives and friends. Manufacturers and businesses have generously donated food, medicine, daily necessities, etc. Enthusiastic about doing good, they have sought each other out. From January 1st to April 30th, a total of 90,818.01 yuan in national currency and 12,163.80 yuan worth of goods have been received.

Use of Donations

From January 1st to April 30th, the hall's expenditures were: water and electricity bills (arrears from the 29th year of the Republic) 18,914 yuan, water and electricity bills 3,834 yuan, rice 37,500 yuan, vegetables, oil, salt, etc. 9,572 yuan, coal 2,306 yuan, clothing 5,210 yuan, medicine 457 yuan, supplies 8,778 yuan, 39 small iron beds 890 yuan, consumables (soap, grass paper, etc.) 1,618 yuan, kerosene 896 yuan, wages 2,421 yuan, transportation costs 602 yuan, totaling 90,998 yuan in national currency.

Budget Estimate

The hall currently averages 1,000 residents per day. The annual expenses are 1,200 bags of rice, 180 tons of coal, 54,000 yuan for vegetables, 5,400 catties of soybean oil, 3,600 catties of salt, 1,800 catties of soy sauce, 120 cans of kerosene, 6,000 yuan for soap and grass paper, 12,000 yuan for clothing, 18,000 yuan for medicine, 2,400 yuan for transportation, 8,400 yuan for wages, 12,000 yuan for water fees, and 20,000 yuan for various contingency expenses, totaling 192,000 yuan. Today, the cost of living is high, and everything is expensive. The above budget is the bare minimum and based on current market prices. Future changes are not yet included.

Looking Forward to Continued Donations

The use of previous donations has been detailed above. According to the hall's budget estimate, in addition to the more than 300,000 yuan already donated, there is still a shortfall of more than 90,000 yuan. If the goal can be reached, the hall's expenses for the 30th year of the Republic can be guaranteed, and the clothing and food of nearly a thousand orphans and elderly people can be ensured. We sincerely hope that readers of this newspaper will continue their past enthusiasm. Those who have not donated should donate generously, and those who have donated should donate again. Both funds and goods are welcome. Donation collection points: Trust Department of the Silk Industry Bank, No. 460 Hankou Road; Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger, Sassoon House on the Bund; Jihua Tang Pharmacy, No. 47 Yunnan Road; Huamei Pharmacy, No. 156 Fuzhou Road; Catholic Church, Catholic Church in the French Concession.

A Bandit Hideout

and the rescue of a kidnapped victim who had been held for a long time. After the robbery case was cracked, based on the thieves' confessions, the police arrested a local woman, Wang Gu's (24 years old), from the gang at No. 14 Songjiazhai, Hongqiao Road, at around 7:00 AM yesterday.

At that time, the bandits actually intended to kidnap his brother, Xia Dexuan, but mistakenly kidnapped him. Afterwards, the police authorities ordered a strict investigation, but to no avail. Unexpectedly, Xia was released incidentally. Two guards of the kidnapped victim, Zheng Debiao and Fang Daoju, from Anhui, were arrested on the spot. However, the main culprit, Wang Jinlong, nicknamed "Little Shaoxing," is still at large. According to the kidnapped victim, Xia Dezhao, after being kidnapped on April 1st, he was initially detained on Columbia Road and then moved to the current bandit hideout on the 6th of this month.

### Man and Woman Commit Suicide Together; Spiritual Marriage Held; Joining as Husband and Wife in the Underworld

Ge Mingshi, from Suzhou, 28 years old, was the manager of the Wanli Printing Factory, set up by his cousin Ge Zhenghai at No. 7 XinKaiHe, which printed the money. He recognized the couple Ji Shishi from Zhenjiang, who lived at number 17 in the neighborhood, as righteous parents, and developed love with Ji's eldest daughter, Shundi, privately pledging their lifelong alliance. Later, Ge lost a large amount of shop money due to gambling, resulting in his cousin stopping his employment. After losing his job, he lived and ate at Ji's house. Because Ji's daughter was already pregnant and near her due date, Ji, having no sons, was willing to marry Shundi to Ge as his wife for support and urged Ge to quickly hire a matchmaker to get married. But Ge was not only unable to marry, but also worried about the problems that would arise in life after marriage. After discussing with Shundi, there was no good solution, so they both had a bad thought and went out together on the 13th. The following night, at the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao, they simultaneously committed suicide by poisoning, but they could not be saved and died. Their bodies were collected and coffined by their families. The details have been recorded in the newspapers. It is now heard that the relatives and friends of both the man and woman, because Ge was unable to get married due to economic difficulties and committed suicide together, and their love was passionate, asked both parents to agree and schedule a spiritual marriage to fulfill the wishes of the deceased, so that they could join as husband and wife in the underworld. Now the two coffins are temporarily placed at  Qian due to transportation reasons and will be taken back to their hometowns by the man's family for burial in the future.

### Two Kidnapping Cases Occurred in the French Concession Last Night; Zhang Yicheng, Prosecutor of the First Special District Court; The Wife and Son of Judge Fang Qinghuan

Zhang Yicheng, a 65-year-old prosecutor of the First Special District Court from Suzhou, lived in the East Wing on the second floor of No. 4 Kanningli, near the Paris Theatre on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. At around 10:10 PM last night, two men suddenly drove to the place in car number 1121. The car stopped at the entrance to the alley, and the two broke into his room, went straight to Zhang's residence on the second floor, immediately drew their guns, threatened and intimidated him, forcibly dragged Zhang out, forced him into the car, and drove away quickly. The family immediately reported the matter to the French police. When Chinese and Western detectives received the news and arrived, the people and car had already left, and their whereabouts were unknown. The police are currently secretly investigating the case. Furthermore, Chen Ziguan, the wife of Judge Fang Qinghuan of the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, who lived at No. 318 Mingdeli, Jinshenfu Road, French Concession, and her five-year-old son were kidnapped at around 7:00 PM last night. At that time, Fang happened to be away from home. It is learned that Ms. Chen previously served as a judge in the Second Special District Court.

### Mother's Day for Nurses

The Chinese Christian Association, in order to promote the virtue of filial piety, specially initiated and designated yesterday as China's first Parents' Day. Amidst enthusiastic gatherings by various groups to celebrate filial piety, the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Nurses Association also held a "Mother's Day" for nurses at the American Church on Avenue Petain, commemorating the nurses' "mother"—Ms. Florence Nightingale of England.

Following a long spell of drizzling rain, the tender green leaves glistened with an extraordinary radiance, and the tranquil Avenue Petain bathed in the warm sunlight. Lush ivy adorned the American Church, and magnificent hymns drifted from the church into the ears of people strolling on the lawn, each person's heart experiencing the cleansing of sacred songs. After two o'clock in the afternoon, white-clad nurses gradually arrived at the large lawn beside the church, their laughter and joy filling the air. From the upper floor of the building next to the church, cheerful sounds of foreigners having lunch could be heard. The beautiful sunlight warmed everyone's face, creating a feeling of early summer. The great magic of the universe and religion made me feel the preciousness of life.

More than five hundred "angels in white" gathered on the lawn and were captured by the camera, before entering the church in an orderly procession. Participants included graduates from major Shanghai hospitals such as the First Red Cross Hospital, Renji Hospital, Red House Women's Hospital, Bethel Hospital, Nanyang Hospital, and the Public Health Nursing Department of the Chinese Health Association, etc. The graduates of each hospital were arranged in the center of the church's upper balcony, student nurses were placed on the left and right balconies, and serving nurses sat in the rows on the church floor. After a majestic march, the entire nursing staff sang the Chinese Nurses Association's anthem. Ms. Wu Zheying, the chairwoman, delivered a speech saying: "Today is the most enthusiastic of our annual nurses' gatherings." This was followed by Pastor Yu's prayer and scripture reading, and then a chorus performance by the Shanghai Women's Medical College choir. Next was a speech by Ms. Tian Cuili, an executive member of the Chinese Nurses Association, who spoke at length, encouraging nurses in the three aspects of virtue, intellect, and physical fitness, hoping that nurses would bravely and loyally take on the responsibility of health, not only in hospitals, but also in any part of society, especially during times of national crisis.

After a solo performance by Mrs. Shen Baochang, Pastor Yu gave another speech. He said that he had only ever addressed doctors once in his life, which was at a medical conference many years ago. He said that usually doctors lecture us, but to have the opportunity to lecture doctors was a great honor. Today was his second time.

"Today is Parents' Day; but today is truly Mother's Day for nurses, so its significance is particularly profound." Pastor Yu said, "Nurses should never forget your 'mother' – Ms. Florence Nightingale, commemorate her birthday, commemorate her service to the nation and her spirit of establishing the nursing profession."

"Florence Nightingale was born on May 12, 1820, and died on August 13, 1910." Pastor Yu continued to report on the history of this "mother" of nurses. "Her body was not very strong, but she was able to enjoy a long life of ninety years, which was the result of her lifelong hard work and service."

"She was born into a wealthy family, but she was rich in the spirit of serving people. Even when she saw a dog about to be put to death by its owner because it was injured, she rescued it and healed the injured dog. This compassion prompted her to nurse patients.

"Because her family was wealthy, she often had the opportunity to travel to various countries and places. Once, she traveled with her family, and suddenly she fell ill herself. With the close care of Catholic priests, her illness was cured. During her illness, she learned nursing methods, which prompted her to decide to promote the nursing profession.

"In 1854, war broke out in Europe. Seeing the pain of the wounded soldiers on the front lines, she resolutely gathered thirty-eight nurses whom she had trained and went to serve on the front lines. After three years of long-term service in the rear of the battlefield, experiencing all kinds of difficulties and hardships, she healed tens of thousands of wounded soldiers. From then on, she received enthusiastic support and welcome from the people of the whole country, and the work of nurses was regarded as the savior of patients, and their status was no less than that of doctors.

"The work of nurses must be respected in order to raise the status of nurses: Ms. Florence Nightingale was able to become the 'mother' of nurses all over the world because she respected her own work. She improved the status of nurses with her hard work and service, as it is today. This is the result of her lifelong struggle. She has the following four requirements for nurses: (1) Continuous and humble learning, (2) Strict observance of discipline and order like soldiers in the army, (3) The spirit of obedience like soldiers to their superiors, (4) Abundant compassion; nurses who do not possess these four qualities cannot be called excellent nurses.

"During the era of 1854, there were two women in England who were most supported by the people of the whole country, one was Queen Elizabeth, and the other was the nurse's 'mother', Florence Nightingale. After Florence Nightingale passed away, she was buried in Westminster Abbey in London, which shows her lofty status and the love and support of the whole country."

This is indeed a most beautiful story for the nurses.

Amidst the majestic hymns, I followed the "angels in white" out of the American Church. At half past four in the afternoon, a beautiful sun shone on the clear road and the surrounding new green branches. (Jiang Ping)

### Teachers Demand Higher Salaries, and Peizhi Still Has Problems

Peichu To Discuss Terms at Length

The faculty and staff of the Peichu Elementary School and Peizhi Elementary School in this city have requested the school to increase their salaries due to the fact that they cannot maintain their livelihoods. According to a Guanghua News Agency reporter, the Peichu Elementary School will hold a meeting with the faculty and staff at 4:00 p.m. today to discuss the matter at length. Although the Peizhi Elementary School has sent letters to various newspapers stating that the matter has been resolved satisfactorily through the mediation of the school board, according to reliable sources, the school's statement is completely untrue, and the inside situation is unknown to outsiders. The details are recorded as follows:

The Future of Peizhi Is Difficult to Be Optimistic About

The school principal, Chen Yuqi (whose actual power is controlled by his younger brother, Chen Wei), originally divided the school into two parts: a junior high school and an elementary school. Eight elementary school teachers, including Yang Qizhan and Wu Tiemin, requested the school to improve their treatment under the principle of not neglecting their teaching due to the rising cost of living, and petitioned the relevant parties to deal with the matter impartially. After personnel were dispatched to go there every day for the past three days, they conducted a fair mediation based on the income and expenditure of both parties. Due to the fact that the school's expenses for this semester had already been slightly increased at the beginning of the semester, there was not much left over, so the salary was calculated for five months as usual, and it has now been temporarily increased to six months, and the remaining will be handled according to the means of making money in the next semester. As for the issue of teacher security, the school firmly refused, believing that the principal had the right to weigh it, and that the two teachers, Yang and Wu, should be replaced immediately. Fortunately, the teachers were able to take the overall situation into account and make a peaceful appeal under the condition of not neglecting their teaching and to submit to reasonable mediation. However, due to the school's lack of sincerity, they usually treat teachers like servants and often scold them publicly. After requesting a salary increase, they took the opportunity to conduct an emergency test. The principal and the director of teaching broke into the classroom, causing a major conflict with the teachers, and announced a one-day suspension of classes as a pretext for the replacement. Therefore, according to general observation, the future of the school is difficult to be optimistic about.

### Vicissitudes of the Ball Field—The Old Nanyang Football Team in the Late Qing Dynasty

— Old Boy

The other day, this newspaper published about the old Nanyang football team of the fifth and sixth years of the Republic of China. Now, tracing back further, I will record the lineup of the old Nanyang football team in the late Qing Dynasty at the end of the article, which is also historical material for the sports world.

Zhang Chunling

Gao Wenbing Tang Ronggeng

Gu Yingbiao

Tang Rongbing Huang Hao

Xi Demao Xi Debing Tang Rongjin Cheng Pengzhu Lu Pinlin

At that time, the most famous in the football world was the right winger Lu Pinlin. At that time, the fashion in the football field was to dribble the ball, and Lu was good at this, and people praised him. Among the eleven people, Zhang, Gao, Cheng, Lu, and the Xi brothers were all people from Jiangsu, and the Tang brothers and Gu and Huang were all from Guangdong. Chunling, Yingbiao, and Rongjin were good at punt pole and the standing triple jump. Rongbing was the strongest, and he was good at shot put. Huang Hao was good at sprinting and sledgehammer (this item is no longer in today's track and field, but at that time there was no discus throw and javelin throw). Demao was good at the 880-yard race. Now only the Xi brothers are famous in the financial world. Mr. Gan has been a railway engineer for a long time, and few people know about him. Huang Hao used to be a jockey, and perhaps some people still know about him. Most of the rest are unknown, and some have passed away, which is truly a vicissitude of the sports world. At that time, the St. John's football team was comparable to Nanyang, and they were repeatedly the leaders. The most famous football players were the Pan brothers, Wenhuan and Wenbing, who were also good at track and field, with the long jump being the best.

### Special Products Unified Sales During Wartime in China

— He Zhang

China's trade policy, amidst the current war, has overcome all difficulties and grown healthily, advancing towards rationalization day by day. In terms of management scope, it has evolved from localized control; in terms of management techniques, it has progressed from simple to rigorous; and in terms of management institutions, it has moved from duplication to unification. These many facts truly fill us with extraordinary excitement.

In particular, in this wartime trade policy, state-run agencies have achieved the greatest success in the unified sales of certain specific items and in the establishment of barter systems with friendly nations. In fact, unified sales and barter are inseparable, with the idea of unified sales originating from barter. Currently, the special products designated by the government for unified sales are tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals. Except for minerals, which are managed by the National Resources Commission, the remaining three are managed by the Trade Commission. Under the commission are three state-owned companies: Fuxing Company handles tung oil; China Tea Company handles tea; and Fuhua Company handles bristles and sundries. Initially, the government unified the sale of tea, which stemmed from the barter trade with the Soviet Union. Subsequently, U.S. loans were established, with tung oil as collateral for the barter agreement, managed by Fuxing Company. Consequently, other commodities have also tended to be included in barter items.

I. Facilities for Unified Sales of Special Products

Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Outline of Measures for Managing National Tea Export Trade," the Trade Commission drafted the "General Rules for the Organization of Tea Management Agencies in Various Provinces," which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and issued to the six tea-producing provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei, instructing them to organize tea management offices in accordance with the aforementioned general rules. In addition, the commission drafted tea loan purchase plans for each province. Since 1938, substantial tea loans were established, with the commission providing 80% and the provincial governments providing 20%. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance ordered the inclusion of tea purchases, domestic sales, and barter matters. In 1940, the Central Trust Bureau of the Ministry of Finance increased its capital and reorganized it into a state-owned specialized company under the jurisdiction of the Trade Commission, which took charge of the unified purchase and sale of tea, thereby further strengthening the tea promotion organization.

The unified sale of tung oil began in 1938. On October 6, 1939, the Trade Commission drafted a proposal for national unified purchase and sale of tung oil, which was submitted to the Ministry of Finance for transmittal to the Executive Yuan for promulgation and implementation. Regarding commissioned purchases, the commission signed a contract with the China Vegetable Oil Factory in December 1938, and then formulated "Provisional Detailed Rules for Adjusting National Tung Oil Trade" in February 1939. Regarding the management of Sichuan tung oil trade, the Sichuan Provincial Government, in order to assist tung oil exports, formulated "Outline of Provisional Measures for Sichuan Tung Oil Trade" with the commission to facilitate the unified purchase and sale work of the Trade Commission. Later, in order to further unify the national purchase and sale of tung oil, the Ministry of Finance promulgated fifteen articles of the "National Tung Oil Unified Purchase and Sale Measures" and seventeen articles of the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the National Tung Oil Unified Purchase and Sale Measures" on October 20, 1940. Since the promulgation of these measures, the unified handling of tung oil purchase and sale matters in various parts of the country has been undertaken by the Fuxing Commercial Company.

Bristles are one of the important export commodities. Sichuan produces more than 3,000 dan of white bristles annually, worth about 2 million yuan, which were previously bleached and sold to various countries by foreign merchants and Japanese traders in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the war, Chinese businessmen established the Yu Bleaching Bristle Factory, but its capital was small and its scale was very small. The Trade Commission then purchased it in January 1939, expanded its original equipment, increased its working capital, and sold it to Europe and the United States on its own. Regarding black bristles, in order to promote exports, the commission signed a contract with the Sichuan Livestock Products Trading Company, entrusting it to purchase them on its behalf. The company could pre-pay the purchase price from the commission when purchasing raw materials to facilitate turnover. On March 3, 1940, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Revised National Bristle Unified Sale Measures," stipulating that the purchase and sale of all kinds of bristles nationwide should be uniformly handled by the Trade Commission. The Trade Commission could entrust business firms and warehouses engaged in the bristle business to handle the purchase and management of bristles.

China's mineral resources are very abundant, such as tungsten, antimony, tin, mercury, etc., which occupy a very important position in world resources. After the outbreak of the war, the purchase and sale of mineral products was executed by the National Resources Commission designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In order to strictly control mineral products in various places, the Ministry of Economic Affairs promulgated the "Regulations on the Management of Mineral Products Transportation" on December 2, 1939. According to these regulations, the "Implementation Measures for the National Resources Commission to Manage Mineral Products" were formulated and promulgated nationwide in January 1940, designating specialized management agencies and entrusting the competent provincial government agencies to manage everything. These agencies have been established in Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hubei and other provinces. All mineral products are divided into two types: Type A mineral products are tungsten, antimony, tin, mercury, , copper, etc.; Type B mineral products are aluminum, nickel, lead, manganese, and other mineral sands, lime, sulfur soil, refractory clay, magnesite, dolomite, acid-base fluorite, alum, gypsum, phosphate rock, arsenic ore and its products. The purchase, transportation and other related matters of Type A mineral products are managed by the tungsten and antimony management divisions, or entrusted to other agencies for execution, and cannot be freely traded. The purchase price is determined and announced by the National Resources Commission at any time. Type B mineral products can be freely traded, but transportation and export must be submitted to the NRC or its entrusted agency for review, the issuance of export permits, and settlement of foreign exchange with the bank before customs declaration can be made. Merchants engaged in mining and refining Type A mineral products should report the actual stock and possible and actual output of the mineral products for registration, so as to allocate production and sales. This method is more unified and stricter than in the past.

II. Overview of Unified Sales Exports

After the government authorities' unified purchase and sale of the above four items, they were able to maintain a good situation in an extremely difficult environment and showed an increasing trend. The following is a brief description of the export situation of these four items:

Chinese tea is sold to Europe, Africa, and the Americas. After the outbreak of the war, China concentrated on trade with the Soviet Union due to its barter trade with the Soviet Union; however, due to transportation inconveniences, it was unable to develop it as much as possible. According to customs records, the total value of various tea exports in 1937 was 29 million yuan. Exports were less in the first half of 1938, but more in the second half, with a total value of more than 33 million yuan. Exports decreased again in the first half of 1939, but increased in the second half, and the total annual value decreased compared with the previous year, to more than 30 million yuan. By 1940, both the export value and quantity had increased, with the value reaching over 104 million yuan; and the quantity increased by more than 100,000 metric tons compared with the previous year. Most of the exports of various Chinese teas were exported through Hong Kong. The Chinese tea market was originally dominated by the United Kingdom, the United States, South Africa, and the Soviet Union. Since the outbreak of the European War, the sales market has undergone great changes. The United Kingdom used an import quota system to control the import of foreign tea, which had a great impact on the Chinese tea market. In the North African market, only Morocco still has a large sales volume recently. The United States has also recently increased. As for the Soviet Union market, there are no recent figures to be found in the customs records; however, according to reports in Chongqing in January this year, it was completed at the end of last year, and its contents are divided into three parts. The first two parts are the exchange of Chinese wool and tea worth 100 million yuan for Soviet aid, which has already been signed and announced. Judging from this huge value, it can be seen that most of China's tea is sold to the Soviet Union.

The tung oil market is the largest in the United States, and other countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and other countries also have considerable imports. Since the outbreak of the war, the impact on tung oil exports can be said to have been very significant. For example, tung oil exports in 1935 were more than 730,000 metric tons, worth more than 41 million yuan; in 1936, they reached more than 860,000 metric tons, worth more than 73 million yuan. In the first half of 1937, tung oil exports were quite impressive, reaching more than 10 million yuan in June, more than 15 million yuan in July, and after August, they were affected by the war and fell to only 5 or 6 million yuan per month; however, the total quantity and total value for the whole year were still very large, with the quantity reaching more than 1 million metric tons and the value reaching 89.8451 million yuan. By 1938, although the Yuehan Railway was still passable before September of that year, tung oil was usually transported in bulk cargo ships, but now it was transported by railway, which was very inconvenient. Therefore, the total quantity of tung oil exports in 1938 decreased to more than 695,700 metric tons, with a value of only more than 39 million yuan. In 1939, tung oil was completely exported through Kunming and Longzhou, with difficult transportation and higher freight costs, which greatly increased prices in foreign markets. Therefore, although the export quantity decreased greatly in that year; the value was similar to that of the previous year. The more than 33 million yuan in 1939 increased by more than 20 million yuan; however, in terms of quantity, it has decreased due to transportation difficulties. After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "National Tung Oil Unified Purchase and Sale Measures" in October 1940, tung oil exports should increase. According to a telecommunications report on March 22 of this year, foreign trade experts observed that the domestically produced tung oil this year will definitely sell well. Its main target is the United States, because: 1. The United States is mass-producing military supplies, and tung oil is one of the main raw materials; 2. The United States’ tung oil production is limited by climate, soil, and labor, and has reached a saturation point. Therefore, tung oil exports should increase in the future.

Bristles have always been an export commodity with a high reputation in China. Recently, due to the government's promotion and control, exports have increased even more. From January to April 1937, they were all around 1 million yuan, more than 2 million yuan in May, more than 3 million yuan in June, more than 4 million yuan in July, and although they dropped to more than 1 million yuan in August; but after September, they were more than 3 million yuan again. It can be seen that this export has not been greatly affected by the war. The situation in 1938 was also impressive, with a total value of 28 million yuan for the whole year. After 1939, due to the government authorities' determination to rectify and do their best to increase exports, the total value for the whole year increased to more than 41 million yuan. The situation in 1940 was even better, with the total value for the whole year reaching more than 94 million yuan, ranking first in exports for that year.

Since the outbreak of the war, thanks to the efforts of the government authorities, the export volume of various important commodities has greatly increased. Among them, minerals are the object of the government authorities' promotion of exports. The object is to maintain the position of the international market on the one hand and to maintain the vitality of the national economy and finance on the other hand. Therefore, the export of mineral products is especially worthy of attention during the war. Mineral exports have totaled more than 100 million yuan in recent years, among which tin, tungsten, and antimony are the most important. These had already become major export commodities before the war, and the export volume during the war is still considerable every year. In 1936, tin ingots and the like were worth more than 26 million yuan. After the outbreak of the war, exports in 1937 were nearly 40 million yuan. In the last three years, they have also been around 35-36 million yuan, mostly exported from Yunnan and Guangxi provinces. The export volume of tungsten ore was very small before the war. In 1935 and 1936, they were only worth about 8-9 million yuan. It was not until 1937 that the export of tungsten ore was worth 40 million yuan, 50 million yuan in 1938, and 45 million yuan in 1939. However, it decreased in 1940, with only 10 million yuan, which may be due to loan repayment relations, and export figures cannot be fully recorded. As for the export of antimony ore, it was a very important export commodity in the last European War; in this great war, it should have even greater importance. However, the export volume in recent years has only been worth 5-6 million yuan, which is only the small number shown in the customs records, and not all of it. After the government unified the sale of this military raw material, the actual export value must be very considerable.

III. Conclusion

The above four special products have achieved such achievements in a difficult environment, which shows the effectiveness of government control. In the first quarter of this year, the export of these four special products generally showed an improved phenomenon. The following is the export value for the first quarter of this year: Tung oil: 81,995 metric tons, 23,864,577 yuan; 50,210 metric tons, 7,538,724 yuan in the same quarter of last year. Tea: 23,135 metric tons, 6,372,555 yuan; 164,270 metric tons, 43,569,392 yuan in the same quarter of last year. Bristles: 755,931 kg, 26,909,147 yuan; 731,470 kg, 8,770,202 yuan in the same quarter of last year. Mineral products including mineral sand, metals and metal products: 102,408,437 yuan; 16,522,727 yuan in the same quarter of the year. As mentioned above, the goods sold by the government have barter or debt repayment relations, and the figures are not the whole picture; however, judging from the export figures of the goods sold by the government in the first quarter of this year, we can also get a glimpse of the increase.

In short, under the government's encouragement of production and unified purchase and sale of these special products, exports can naturally be increased in the future. If Chinese people can fully cooperate with the government, they can achieve greater effectiveness in control. What needs to be explained here is that wartime export trade contains a new meaning. The foreign exchange of this trade is an important source. With foreign exchange, we can consolidate finance and import production tools from abroad. In other words, wartime export trade is an important source of national defense power. Therefore, the people's real cooperation with the government is an inescapable duty.

Sino-American monetary negotiations began last autumn and immediately decided on the principle of a Sino-American monetary alliance; however, the agreement has not been signed, presumably due to technical issues.

Now, the agreement was signed at the end of last month, and the United States has provided 50 million US dollars as one of the legal tender exchange stabilization funds: at the same time, the United Kingdom has also expanded the fund to 10 million pounds. Together with the amount provided by our national bank, the legal tender exchange fund is at least over 110 million US dollars. The Chinese, British, and American authorities are currently selecting personnel to form a joint management committee for the exchange stabilization fund. Needless to say, the piling problem that was previously unresolved has now been completely resolved.

But how was it resolved? That is, how to stabilize the exchange market between China, Britain, and the United States? It is not something that outsiders can know, but it is also the issue that outsiders most want to know.

In the foreign exchange black market in this city these past few days, Chinese and foreign banks, especially Japanese banks, have been throwing foreign exchange to HSBC. I think: in addition to escaping future losses, it may not be without the intention of testing HSBC's attitude towards the future exchange stabilization policy.

What decisions have the three countries made regarding the future stabilization policy? We naturally cannot know. But what can be said with certainty is that the foundation of the legal tender will be strengthened from now on, and the position of the legal tender in the international foreign exchange market will inevitably be improved from now on; US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau expressed full optimism about this when reporting the Sino-American monetary alliance to Congress the day before yesterday; authoritative figures in London have also frequently issued optimistic views on the future of the legal tender. Moreover, the black exchange rate in this city has been lengthening step by step; the price of gold is plummeting miserably, etc.; all of which reflect the general good psychology of speculators. Because of this, throwing foreign exchange now is to escape losses, and taking it in becomes accepting losses. However, in order to avoid falling into the hands of others, HSBC has to appropriately take it in. As a result, HSBC's listing has to be carried out in steps: the activities on HSBC's small counters have to become a situation where some are relaxed and some are not accepted; and the softening outside the bank is an opportunity for HSBC to pull back legal tender and pass on losses, just like the softening that occurred once last weekend and then rebounded.

The so-called use of the exchange stabilization fund, in addition to stabilizing at what level, has a special topic in Shanghai: that is, how to prevent it from falling into the hands of others? In the past, people were used to linking "maintaining" and "not maintaining" with this issue; now it is no longer valid. After the signing of the Sino-American Central Monetary Agreement, the four banks decisively resumed business, which shows that "maintaining" is actually an established and unchangeable fixed policy. And the removal of this threat seems to be a more important key. These are the two plans of the United States to expand the embargo and freeze the Axis countries' deposits in the United States. With the extremely tense relations between Japan and the United States now, the need for the Japanese side to steal American foreign exchange has been reduced to a minimum, and it will only get worse from now on. Once the freeze is implemented, there will be no problem. Because of this, the future Sino-British and Sino-American exchange stabilization policies are very clear. In a word, the use of the exchange stabilization fund will be linked to the price policy of free China from now on? It is no longer simply limited to the adjustment of the international balance of payments as in the past. Although the goal is not Shanghai, Shanghai will be the first to obtain its good influence.

### Seeing, Hearing, Thinking

When US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau reported to Congress on the establishment of the Sino-British-American Exchange Stabilization Fund, he also formally requested Congress to authorize the President to reduce the gold content of the US dollar. These two things are talked about together for the first time.

The commercial exchange rates listed by China and Communications Banks are 4.5 pence for British foreign exchange, 7.5 yuan for US foreign exchange, and 2.23 yuan for Hong Kong foreign exchange. In the past, they never had any effect on the Shanghai black market. In the future, they may be decorated into a butcher knife to wipe out speculators.

The great move of the two concession authorities to transport rice to Shanghai has flattened the heads of the rice smugglers. Countless lives have been saved. It is hoped that the market will be further cleaned up internally, the remaining warlords will be eliminated, and future troubles will be avoided.

It is estimated that speculators sacrificed about 30 million yuan in the rice market, about 100 million yuan in the gold market, about 100 million yuan in the yarn market, and a total of about 300 million yuan in foreign stocks and securities, etc., in the current market improvement. However, it has not yet reached the end!

Commercial News

### Finance: India Silver Plummets Five Annas

Bombay, 10th (Telegraph) - The Bombay silver market suddenly plummeted by five annas. Spot prices were sluggish, with a total of 100 transactions. There was no market for American and British silver, it is said.

### Yarn and Cotton: Overseas Cotton Markets are Rising

New York cotton market: Initially rose due to purchases by Wall Street stock traders, then fell back due to profit-taking by bulls. The closing result was still up 4 to 13 pounds per ton compared to the previous day.

Bombay cotton market: Initially rose due to purchases by speculators, then fell back due to cotton merchants hedging, and finally rose again due to short covering. The closing result was up 2.34 rupees compared to the previous day.

Also, the opening forecast for today is that prices will rise by 0.75.

Also, a telegram reports that the Indian cotton statistics from September 1, last year, to May 10, this year, are recorded on the left (per bale of 400 pounds):

Total listings in Bombay: 2,420,000

Remaining inventory: 1,458,000

Listings in Karachi: 1,218,000

Total exports: 987,000

Remaining inventory: 365,000

### Seafood: Dried Abalone and Scallops Both Rise

Dried Abalone: Arrivals of high-quality abalone are scarce. If there is no more East-end abalone, supply will be cut off. Therefore, the side-end abalone is rising in price. Yesterday, the market opened at 784 yuan, and the market situation is very strong.

Scallops: Arrivals and inventory are also scarce, and the market situation is very strong. Yesterday, the market opened at 735 yuan for large scallops, 727 yuan for medium scallops, and 711 yuan for small scallops. Sales are very brisk.

### North-South Goods: Top-Grade Red Dates Rise

Tianjin Red Dates: There have been few continued arrivals recently, and the market is not very thick. Therefore, the trend is upwards. Yesterday, the market price for first-grade red dates was 65 yuan, second-grade 55 yuan, and Cangzhou red dates 55 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to mid-month. However, miscellaneous grades are cheaper, with neighboring county government red dates at 49 yuan and long red dates at 26-27 yuan.

### Piece Goods: Silk-Like Feather Yarn is Selling Best

Feather yarn is divided into Western goods and local factory goods, and into twill and plain-woven. Twill is needed in the cold winter and sells widely, while plain-woven is in demand in the hot summer. The trend of local factory feather yarn has recently been better than that of imported goods, because silk-like feather yarn is cheap and beautiful, and very much in line with customers' tastes. Not only do 80-90% of Western-style suits and clothing choose to use it, but it has also become popular as a lining material for Chinese-style clothing recently, so sales are even more robust. It is found that the best-selling item recently is silk-like feather yarn, followed by local factory plain-woven. In terms of prices, yesterday, imported double-width twill feather yarn was priced at 18 yuan per yard, first-grade plain-woven 17 yuan, and second-grade 16 yuan. Local factory plain-woven feather yarn, single-width first-grade was sold at 3 yuan 2.5 jiao, second-grade 1.89 yuan, and third-grade 1.45-1.5 yuan. Silk-like twill feather yarn, special grade 3 yuan, first-grade 2.5-2.6 jiao, second-grade 2.2-2.3 jiao, and third-grade 1.85-2 yuan.

### Saxe-Coburg Top is Steady

Saxe-Coburg Top has been popular in Shanghai for five years since its arrival, and it is still popular. However, looking back at past actual sales, there is a big difference, because high-end goods are expensive and purchasing power is weakened. Lower-end goods are not sturdy and not durable, and customers mostly abandon them. On the supply side, there are shortages of goods from the East and West, and local factories produce little, so supply and demand are equal. The trend is unstable, and prices have not increased as much as other woolen fabrics. Yesterday, American-made first-grade Saxe-Coburg Top was priced at over 40 yuan per yard, and ordinary grades at around 30 yuan. Japanese goods, first-grade 9.5 yuan, second-grade 7.5 yuan. Local factory wide-width first-grade sells for 12 yuan, and second-grade 10.05 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Tortoise Shells Open Higher

Tortoise Shells: There have been few continued arrivals recently. Some customers once brought dozens of packages from the Yangtze River and held onto them until recently, when they began to sell them. Although there was an increase of more than ten yuan compared to the initial arrival price, the difference was limited after adding warehouse rent and interest expenses. Market prices have slightly increased, but sales have not been strong, and there is no hope of excessive increases for the time being.

### Hardware: Deformed Steel Bars are Stagnant and the Market is Sluggish

Deformed Steel: Deformed steel bars are a necessity for the construction industry, but recently, the construction industry has not been very enthusiastic about purchasing them. Therefore, the opening price is not as firm as before. Currently, 3-4 minute specifications are priced at 3,300 yuan per ton, and 5-minute to 1-inch goods are priced at 3,250 yuan.

### Rubber by Gao Jiannong

Rubber is the white sap from the rubber tree—or simply the rubber tree—that has coagulated. There are many types of rubber trees, distributed across the three continents of Asia, the Americas, and Africa. Previously, Brazil produced the most, but now the South Seas Islands, especially the Malay Peninsula, are the leaders in production.

The White man’s knowledge of rubber can be traced back to the first half of the sixteenth century, when the Spanish had just conquered Mexico. Some priests saw the natives using the sap from a type of rubber tree called Castilloa to make leather balls or armor, but this did not cause much of a stir. Two centuries later, in 1736, near the equator at La Conasnrine, and upstream on the Orinoco River, someone saw Indians using “elastic pear-shaped vessels.” He wrote a report, attaching samples, and sent it to the French National Academy of Sciences. However, this paper was not published by the Academy until fifteen years later. In 1768, the properties of rubber were again studied in the area by engineer Fresneau, who submitted a report to the Academy of Sciences, but the Academy did not even print it. Nevertheless, the wonderful use of rubber by the Indians for erasing pencil marks gradually became known, and White men timidly used rubber to make some unimportant small tools. In short, the greatest use of rubber at that time was still just cutting up the rubber balls made by the Indians to make "small erasers" to erase pencil marks. (To be continued)

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### Spiritual Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation
— Yu Yu

This publication has always had remarkable discussions on clothing, food, housing, and transportation, benefiting readers greatly. However, it has only discussed some material aspects of these things, and seems to have little research on the spiritual aspects. Therefore, today I want to make an exception and talk about some things so that we can have good clothing, food, housing, and transportation in the spiritual sense.

Without further ado, I will now discuss it in four points:

Clothing - Every day we get up and must change into clean clothes to wear, so that others and ourselves will not feel the smell of sweat, and we must also make our clothes give people a sense of beauty. But in the spiritual sense, we must also have a delicate and beautiful garment to wear on our body, so that others will envy and respect us. But what kind of garment is that? I can simply say that it is "the garment of morality". People with high morals and good character are wearing clean "moral clothing", and they are actually more beautiful than those who wear flashy clothes in form.

Food - We eat every day to grow and live. But in the spiritual sense, we must also have a kind of spiritual food to expand our knowledge and enrich our experience. The so-called "spiritual food" refers to good books and real-life experiences, which can make our learning profound and strengthen our spiritual bodies. Therefore, a person who eats fat in form, if he has not received an education, then his body is still weak and unhealthy.

Housing - If a person lives in a magnificent and comfortable house, in material terms, he is indeed very comfortable. But if this person is very lonely, then I think he must still be in great pain spiritually. Therefore, I believe that in the spiritual sense, "living" should be "living" among the masses, which means that we should think of the masses in everything we do, not be selfish, but regard ourselves as one of the vast masses, and be comfortable for the comfort of the masses, and be in pain for the pain of the masses. Therefore, although a person lives in a small and dark cubicle in material terms, if he can place his spirit in the masses, then he is like living in a magnificent and beautiful house.

Transportation - When we walk, we always choose clean and wide streets to walk on, and do not like dark and dirty narrow alleys. I think that in the journey of life, we should also choose the broad road, and should not go into a fork in the road, so that we have the danger of falling into a trap. Therefore, those who walk on the path of light, their future is also bright.

### Hats and Socks
— Lan

Hats should be light and soft and without strong pressure, because the skin of the head is the same as the skin of other parts of the body, and it also needs to emit water vapor and carbon dioxide, so whether or not there is ventilation in the hat, the water vapor, etc. in the head will fill the hat and increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the hat, which will cause headaches. According to experts, headaches will occur as long as the amount of carbon dioxide in the air in the hat is more than 0.3% higher than the outside world. Therefore, it is necessary to use materials with good ventilation to make hats, such as felt hats and woolen hats made of materials without ventilation, and sufficient ventilation holes must be prepared to make the air in the hat easy to circulate.

Hair is a natural protection for the head, so there is originally no need to wear a hat, but many people like to wear hats, and almost treat them as decorations, but when wearing a hat, the above conditions cannot be ignored. When going out in winter, just wear a hat that can maintain the temperature of the head, otherwise the head will be in danger of congestion. When going out in summer, you can wear a straw hat with sufficient ventilation holes to block the sunlight. If you carry a parasol, then you don’t need to wear a hat.

There are many types of shoes, but leather shoes are the most common. Although leather shoes can prevent moisture, the air in leather shoes is scarce, the specific gravity is large, and the moisture transfer is strong. Therefore, it is not suitable to wear leather shoes in winter. Moreover, leather shoes have no ventilation. The water vapor and carbon dioxide emitted from the skin are all stagnant inside, especially when walking, the emission of these excretions is more vigorous, resulting in sweating feet and moist feet, resulting in the so-called "dampness" disease, so leather shoes are not very hygienic. Shoes made of serge or cloth have fewer disadvantages, but leather shoes can overwhelm everything in terms of not leaking water and being durable. In short, it is best to choose a material that is waterproof and has ventilation to make shoes.

The first thing to pay attention to in shoes is whether they fit the size of the feet. Shoes that are too small can easily cause skin damage or bone deformation, and there is a risk of nail disease. Also, high heels can cause the toes to bend at the bottom and cause foot bone deformation, and it is also very easy to operate the waist, so it is best not to wear them.

Socks are also worth paying attention to. In summer, thin socks are suitable. If you wear shoes with great warmth retention in winter, such as leather shoes, it is better to wear thick socks that are lighter and contain a large amount of air, because it has the effect of preventing temperature loss and reducing sweat secretion and circulating air. Therefore, it is suitable to wear wool socks in winter. Because socks are more easily soiled than other parts, and absorb more moisture, and emit more excretions, emitting an indescribable stench, so they must be changed and washed frequently, and it is most appropriate to change them every day. Moreover, it is better to wash lightly when slightly dirty than to wash strongly when very dirty. Although the number of washes is more, the chance of damage is reduced.

### The Story of the Potato
— Overtones

About two hundred years ago, potatoes were still an unfamiliar name in Europe. Once, a wealthy merchant suddenly received a strange gift from his friend—a small bag of potatoes, so he asked his gardener to plant them in the best soil, and was already prepared to taste their deliciousness. In the autumn, the merchant specially invited his friends to dinner, so he told the cook to make a bowl of potatoes well. However, the cook had never cooked this strange thing, so he flavored the tender stems, leaves, and small green fruits with sugar and spices, and then sent them to the banquet. After tasting it, the guests felt that it was tasteless. So this novel food was taken back to the kitchen and eaten by the servants. After a few hours, this group of people fell ill. The doctor said: "This vegetable contains a considerable amount of toxins, but it doesn't matter, it will be fine after a few days." So the potatoes were thrown in the corner of the garden. A few days later, the gardener ordered his son to burn the dried potatoes. The child was very happy to do it. After he burned the dried stems and leaves, he found lumps of things on the roots of the potatoes in the ashes. After peeling off a thin layer of skin, he could see white and powdery flesh. The smell seemed very fragrant? The taste was very good! So he went to tell his father, and his father also felt it was very delicious. At this point, the gardener and the cook realized their mistake. As a result, the master re-asked his friend for some potatoes. From this time on, potatoes became a daily vegetable in European families.

### Escalator
— Fan Xuehui

When I was young, I was used to walking on the wide and large escalators at home. Occasionally, when I went to my neighbors' houses, I saw their high bungalows with a shelf on top. When people wanted to go up to sleep, they had to climb up from a bamboo ladder. I thought this was very dangerous.

Later, when I first went from my hometown to the city, I saw the escalators in the city, which were as small as the bamboo ladders in our hometown. It seemed that they wanted to save the position of the escalator.

When I came to the metropolis from the city, it made me even more surprised. The escalators in the metropolis were narrower, steeper, and there were many of them, extremely dark, and dust accumulated.

Therefore, I often think that Chinese people are unwilling to think about small things; although a small escalator, it is not only convenient for walking; dust accumulation, unbearable darkness, hinders hygiene, and once a fire occurs, it is related to the safety of life in the whole house.

I often observe that developed countries in Europe and the United States attach great importance to the escalators in houses. They not only build them firmly, but also place them in a considerable position, or near a window, to make them bright and ensure safety.

### One Week's Family Menu
— Ms. Hua Ying

For some reason these days, even vegetables have become expensive. Two or three dimes for a pound of vegetables is a very common thing. As for the newly listed seasonal vegetables, needless to say. Amaranth has been on the market for more than ten days, but I have not yet included it in the menu, just because the price is too expensive. The beauty of amaranth lies in its softness and glutinousness. You can't do without it for any kind of fish soup, especially yellow croaker soup. It is extra delicious when you add amaranth. In addition, it is not bad to make soup with shredded pork or sliced pork. As for making vegetarian dishes, you can only stir-fry them. Red amaranth is not yet on the market, and the vegetable is also soft and glutinous, but the soup is red, and some people dare not eat it, which is laughable.

Monday: Stir-fried bamboo shoots with shredded pork, scrambled eggs with chives, stir-fried green vegetables with vermicelli, diced bamboo shoots stir-fried with broad beans

Tuesday: Celery shredded beef, steamed pomfret, vegetable stewed tofu, bamboo shoots mixed with mushroom floss

Wednesday: Preserved mustard tuber shredded pork soup, pan-fried salted fish, stir-fried golden needle vegetable, broad bean tofu flower

Thursday: Curry sliced beef, braised prawns with tofu, braised radish slices, dried shrimp seaweed soup

Friday: Bean curd sheets stir-fried with shredded pork, sweet and sour fried ribbonfish, pickled mustard greens with soybean sprouts, sesame paste mixed with water celery

Saturday: Daylily stir-fried with shredded chicken, amaranth yellow croaker daylily, vegetarian quilt, sweet and sour shredded radish

Sunday: Duck offal soup, braised cuttlefish, stir-fried broad beans, mixed wormwood

### From Kunming to Lashio
— Observer

A friend's letter:

There is no food to be had along the way in this section of the journey. Because my colleagues did not know this beforehand, they brought too little dry food. We had to try our best to reduce food and drink for one day and two nights to avoid hunger and thirst. Even if we had thousands of gold coins, we could not buy anything. Gold is useless here. This experience cannot be missed. At 2:00 p.m. on the 21st, we arrived at a bridge. The driver of the front car suddenly pointed to the sky. Everyone understood what was going on, so we stopped the car and sat on the rocks to watch quietly. Before long, earth and stones flew. At this time, everyone only cared about the safety of the bridge, and put their own lives out of their minds; sincerely because the iron cable flying bridge over the empty place is the only one left, how can we not be worried? After a few minutes, the sound stopped, so we accompanied the driver down the mountain and detoured to the bridge. Seeing that the bridge was still intact, we couldn't help cheering. Otherwise, there would be at least a week's delay. We also went to the place where the beacon was set up to check, and picked up two pieces of shrapnel to keep as souvenirs. Who knew that they were later stolen by someone? This thief can be said to have a purpose in stealing this thing.

The highway was destroyed! But it was repaired before dark. Vehicles drove through one after another. At 11:00 p.m., we arrived at Lameng (781.7 kilometers). Without food or accommodation, we slept in the car again for a night. On the 22nd, we stayed in Zhishi (873 kilometers), which is under the jurisdiction of the Tusi. Seven or eight out of ten residents are Han Baiyi people, and only two or three out of ten are Chinese. This place is most prone to miasma and epidemics every rainy season. Except for those who are truly poor, everyone avoids going to other places, and no one dares to stay. The Bank of China has a branch here. That day happened to be the market day—one market every five days! So the market was quite lively. I was guided by my friends to visit various places. Only then did I know that this place is in a pile of chaotic mountains, with crisscrossing ditches. Mosquitoes breed after rain, spreading malignant malaria. The residents do not pay attention to hygiene, and pigs and cattle are everywhere, leaving excrement everywhere. In this early spring season, I already felt a turbid stench. When the weather gets warmer and the sun shines on it, the smell is even more unbearable to imagine, and it is really the source of epidemics. If this situation can be improved, it will not be difficult to turn the miasma village into a paradise. The market is a mix of Chinese and barbarians. The barbarians on the mountain wear iron chains around their waists, or bamboo strips around them, their mouths are like basins of blood, their upper bodies are half naked, and they hear very barbaric things. There is another kind of raw barbarian. They do not go down the mountain often, and take killing foreigners as bravery. On the 23rd, we stayed in Wanting—959.4 kilometers—This place is newly developed, so the market is not as good as Zhishi. At the border between China and Myanmar, there are five or six white crosses of five feet square to demarcate the boundary. Wanting is also under the jurisdiction of the Tusi; there are very few Chinese, only travelers passing through. After passing this, you leave the country and enter Myanmar. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 24th, we arrived safely in Lashio. The eleven-day journey came to an end.

The trucks traveled on the mountains, bumping violently, making people laugh and cry. Accidents of overturned vehicles often occurred along the way. In the abyss of ten thousand feet, even if the body is not crushed, there is no life left. This trip was also full of dangers. Once, a mountain stone collapsed, and the car happened to be at a bend. It was too late to brake; fortunately, the driver was clever and opened the throttle to rush over. Less than a minute after the car passed, we heard a loud noise, with the potential to shatter the earth. Once again, it was also at a bend, and we almost collided with an oncoming car; the driver was stubborn and stubbornly honked the horn to greet the oncoming car, but they were all very brave.

The ground in Lashio is quite small, and it is completely newly developed virgin land. The sound of "chopping wood" can be heard endlessly in the streets. The houses are all made of wooden boards and topped with iron sheets. Occasionally, there are very few buildings built with cement, but the roofs are still made of iron sheets. Teak is to Lashio what pine board is to the mainland of our country. The most residents are Burmese, followed by Indians. In addition to overseas Chinese, most Chinese in Lashio are engaged in transportation. There are very few electric lights. Due to coal source problems, most use gasoline lamps. The cost of living is very high; there are no scenic spots or scenery, and no high-end cinemas. There is only one cinema opened by Indians, showing films taken by Indians, and occasionally old British films. Fortunately, Chongqing newspapers are delivered very quickly, and you can see them in three or four days. In addition, there are Yangon newspapers to read. The climate is very warm at noon, and the difference between morning and evening is very large. Many Chinese who come here suffer from malaria. Airmail letters take about 20 days to arrive. (End)

Spring and Autumn

### Cityscape
— Li Hongli

A corner of the city

For the sake of the "meal package" on Weng Da's road, Xiao Qizi was discussing it with Xiao Maizi, A Wu, and Gu Gu. When the time for fast seating came, the rice-carrying burden appeared in the distance. Weng Da, who was half-starved, rushed up first. Xiao Qizi and the others had already guarded against him, and chased him up in three steps and two steps. A Wu hugged Weng Da tightly. The two of them quickly emptied the remaining rice and vegetables and ran away in a puff of smoke!

"Chasing is like a blind man with a lantern!" He picked up the remaining rice grains on the ground and ate them before preparing to leave.

"Get out! Want to run, pick it up and go!" The man carrying the burden roared.

"Why? I didn't eat anything."

"Damn you, you guys want to cross the threshold? You eat free food without working. Are you going to carry it or not?"

Weng Da felt two twinges of pain on his head. He picked up the burden and left.

The more Weng Da carried, the heavier it became, and the slower he walked. He asked the old quartermaster to let him rest several times, but he was not allowed. When he felt light all over, his feet could only drag him along!

He suddenly seemed to have discovered something. He didn't know where a burst of courage came from. He rushed forward and grabbed a pedestrian's bread and ran desperately, ran…

He could no longer hear the shouts behind him. He stopped, and his chest felt hot. With a "click," he spat bright red blood on the ground. He sat down against the corner of the wall, wishing he could swallow the whole bread in one bite.

Laijiao A Si didn't know when he came out. Weng Da was so frightened that he trembled, just wanting to hide the half-eaten bread.

"Weng Da! Let's share it!"

"It's not that easy. This was exchanged for my life!"

"Are you giving it or not?" He was a little angry.

"I'm not giving it!" He also hummed.

Laijiao A Si was the first to strike. The two fought for a while.

When Weng Da woke up, the bread was long gone! There was some blood and pus on the ground, left by Laijiao A Si!

He slowly stood up, wanting to beat Laijiao A Si and Xiao Qizi and the others to settle the score.

Turning a corner, a group of "colleagues" were all standing on the side of the road. From their mouths, he learned that a rice truck was coming back!

A few people were discussing: who was willing to hang on the car to cut open the rice bag so that everyone could share it? Weng Da agreed!

The street lights were already on! The car really came. He hung on the car, took out a knife and cut the sack. The whip on top mercilessly hit his head, hands, and body. He didn't let go, still cutting. The rice rustled out, and they all caught it!

Finally, he lost his grip and fell, but those "colleagues" were nowhere to be seen!

It was completely dark! Weng Da, whose body was full of scars, stepped into the small alley. A burst of groans shook his eardrums. Under the dim light, he recognized the person lying on the ground.

"Ma Pi!…"

"Water…"

Large beads of sweat fell from Ma Pi's forehead.

"Water… water…"

Weng Da asked for a bowl of water near his home and walked here:

"The water's here!…"

"…………"

Ma Pi's head was raised by his hand, and his eyes stared straight at him.

"Uh!… a foul odor went straight into his nostrils. The blisters on Ma Pi's feet had already burst! White water was flowing out.

"It's over!…"

He thought for a while, rummaging in Ma Pi's clothes for a long time with both hands, but he only got a small packet of "white powder" that could still be sold for two dimes!

He thought again for a while.

By the time he left here, Ma Pi's body was already naked!

### Wedding Ceremony — A Sketch from the Hall of Joy

— Ju

"Mr. Yan, Mr. So-and-so has arrived!" Little Wang, who was at the door distributing tips for the rickshaw pullers, hopped in excitedly. General Manager Yan, engrossed in arranging the hall, barely registered Little Wang's words. Impatient and agitated, Little Wang dragged him away. Just as General Manager Yan was about to ask what was happening, someone carrying a "Welcome" sign shouted "Guest has arrived!" and bumped right into him. He was quick-witted; wasn't the person behind him the Mr. So-and-so he had invited to officiate the wedding?

"Haha, Mr. So-and-so, thank you for your trouble, truly thank you for your trouble."

"Haha, ha... ha," Mr. So-and-so echoed, seemingly filled with joy as well, his eyes sweeping around. He offered congratulations, exchanged bows, and was offered tea. Mr. So-and-so sat down on a chair, his eyes sweeping around again.

"Mr. So-and-so, thank you for gracing us with your presence; we are truly honored, haha..." the host said obsequiously, bowing low.

"Haha, it's nothing, I'm honored to be considered... And Mr. Yan is an old friend, haha."

"Mr. So-and-so is truly a man of his word," General Manager Yan said, as if having received a compliment. "Is it, perhaps, a bit early? We just finished lunch."

"Well, maybe about right. It's past 2:30." Mr. So-and-so stood up, and everyone else in the room stood up with him. "It's better to start earlier anyway, gives us more leeway..."

"Yes, yes, and the performance can be extended a bit," someone inside said.

"Indeed, Mr. So-and-so's insight is excellent," said another.

Thus, the manager, the host, the ushers, and others bustled about, tidying up the hall with great energy. Gradually, it took on a more solemn air. Mr. So-and-so also assisted frequently, making sure the marriage certificate, inkpad, order of ceremony, etc., were all properly distributed.

Mr. So-and-so dabbed his forehead with a silk handkerchief and leisurely strolled to the front of the stage. The ceremony proceeded at his urging, an hour earlier than originally scheduled.

"Haha, marriage, marriage, is meant to be 'hurried, hurried,' haha, haha," Mr. So-and-so said with a wide grin, as if defending himself.

"Haha,"... The wedding march played at a fast tempo, the bride and groom were nervous, the guests were joyful, and Mr. So-and-so was even more anxious.

"Mr. Yan, I'm off." Mr. So-and-so had just put his badge into his pocket. Without waiting for a "goodbye," he stepped "backwards" and greeted the manager, straightening his collar.

"Mr. So-and-so, stay and have a drink!" The host, noticing the officiant suddenly backing away, personally hurried over.

"Ah, no need to be so polite, I have other engagements." Mr. So-and-so turned and bowed slightly.

"Sir, you are truly a busy person of importance. So we won't stand on ceremony. Do you have other families to attend to today?" The manager asked as he escorted him to the door.

"Well, three more... Haha, I really can't turn myself around."

"Thank you for your trouble, Mr. So-and-so." The host gave a deep, ninety-degree bow as he stepped into the car.

Mr. So-and-so was a prominent figure in society and the wedding officiant here, so everyone talked about him at the banquet.

"Mr. So-and-so's presence is truly an honor to our humble abode. Isn't it so? He is a well-known figure, known by women and children, and very difficult to invite!"

"Does he accept every invitation? If not, would he really bother to come and cut ribbons, officiate weddings, etc.? General Manager Yan has already prepared a generous thank-you for him! Haha..."

(8) A Touching Friendship

When Begonia regained consciousness for the second time, the first reaction he felt in his body was the pain in his face. It was excruciating, more painful than a bird pecking at an insect, truly like dozens and hundreds of silk needles pricking into his muscles. Especially his left eye, it was both painful and itchy, making him unable to resist raising his right hand to touch it.

But as soon as his hand was halfway there, he felt someone holding it down. Then, he heard a woman's voice gently saying in his ear:

"Don't move! It won't hurt after a while." Only then did he open his only remaining right eye. In the strong electric light, he found that what he saw was almost all white: a white ceiling, white curtains, white tables and chairs, a white bedspread, even the clothes worn by the people walking around the room were white.

"Where is this place?" After suffering excessive stimulation, his brain felt somewhat dizzy.

"Yuqin, can you forgive me?" A very familiar voice rang out in front of his bed. He peered around with his right eye for a long time before discovering that among those people dressed in white, one was actually Yuan Shaowen.

Although Shaowen still managed a faint smile, his expression was so miserable. He couldn't comfort Begonia, but instead reminded him of the scene that had unfolded a few hours earlier.

He knew that he was finished! With such an ugly face, not only could he not perform, he simply couldn't even stand in front of people! He really wished he could tear off all the gauze bandages on his face right away.

"Please rest quietly for a few days!" Shaowen held his hand and said, "Everything is on me."

"Your life is definitely not in danger," said someone wearing glasses who looked like a doctor.

A few drops of tears slowly rolled out of Begonia's wide-open right eye.

"Life? Of course, life is not in danger!" Although he spoke in a very low voice, the emotion of anger was clearly burning strongly in his heart. "This is called unforgiving even in death!" (103)
