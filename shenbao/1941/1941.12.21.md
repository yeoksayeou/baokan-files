### Important Negotiations Underway in Moscow and Washington; Rumor of British-Soviet Discussions to Form a Military Alliance; U.S. Considers Leasing Siberian Base

London, 19th – Important diplomatic talks are currently underway in both Moscow and Washington. British representatives in both locations are assisted by diplomats and military experts, discussing operational strategies and implementation methods with relevant countries. The purpose of the talks in Moscow is to conclude a military alliance, and to issue a statement listing their war aims, following the precedent of Roosevelt and Churchill's joint declaration. Therefore, relevant parties should exchange views on issues such as manpower, materials, transportation, and strategy. The above matters may be limited to Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. However, if the Soviet Union is willing to include the Far East issue in the discussions, the United Kingdom is willing to accept it. However, the Soviet Union has previously issued a statement stating that the main goal of the Soviet Union at present is to drive the German army out of the Soviet Union. Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union is not in a position to open a second front against Japan. The significance of this statement by the Soviet Union is very obvious. If this statement is the position of the Soviet government, it will be difficult for the United Kingdom and the United States to force it. The Allied countries have long anticipated that once Japan enters the war, the Allied countries will inevitably suffer some setbacks for a considerable period of time. However, there may be staff talks in Washington. Representatives of the British Empire, the Netherlands, and the United States had preliminary talks before Japan began its offensive. It is believed here that Singapore is an important base for the United Kingdom in the Far East. The talks in Washington must have discussed strategies to defend it. In addition, the Allied countries’ attitude towards Vichy France, and the countermeasures to be taken if Germany attacks North Africa via Spain, are also urgently awaiting discussion. The methods and exact timing for the United Kingdom and the United States to expand their land, sea, and air forces, and how to dispatch expeditionary forces to any threatened area in the world, can also be discussed by British and American representatives. How the United States supplies materials to the Allied countries will also be discussed. The United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have now taken all possible measures to realize close cooperation between the three countries. The China issue is also one of the main issues.

Havas Agency, Washington, 19th – President Roosevelt said today when meeting with reporters that the Allied countries have held meetings many times to discuss the progress of the war. However, the President avoided expressing his views on the possibility of the Allied countries convening a military conference to discuss joint operational plans. He only said that his recent meeting with the Australian Minister to the United States, Harsui, mainly focused on the issue of implementing joint defense.

Domei News Agency, Buenos Aires, 19th – According to a United Press report from New York today, Columbia Broadcasting System reporter Hillu stated that British Foreign Secretary Eden is currently visiting Moscow and has met with Stalin in the past few days.

Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 20th – Information Bureau Acting Spokesman Hori stated to reporters today that the Japanese government is closely monitoring the discussions between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union regarding leasing a military base in Siberia to the United States, but has not yet received any official reports or reliable information and therefore does not wish to comment.

Havas Agency, Istanbul, 20th – It is rumored that British Prime Minister Churchill has departed for Cairo to preside over an important conference.

This rumor has not yet been confirmed.

Haitong Agency, Stockholm, 20th – Political figures in London are currently speculating on Prime Minister Churchill's whereabouts. Churchill has not been seen in the House of Commons for the past three days. At yesterday's meeting of the House of Commons, Lord Privy Seal Major Attlee refused to announce Churchill's whereabouts, thus arousing all sorts of rumors. Some say that Churchill is somewhere overseas, holding extremely important political meetings with Allied politicians in Washington or Moscow.

Havas Agency, Washington, 19th – The Navy Department has just issued a communique stating that there were no new developments in the battles on all fronts yesterday. According to a communique issued by Yu, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Forces, "The Japanese army in the Philippine Islands has been more active in the past 24 hours." Manila and Iloilo Port on Panay Island were both subjected to large-scale air raids. Luzon Island, except for three strongholds occupied by the Japanese army, is otherwise under the control of the U.S. military. There is nothing else worth mentioning in other locations.

Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 20th – The Imperial Headquarters of the Army and Navy jointly announced at 5:30 PM today that Japanese army and naval units landed on Mindanao in the Philippines at dawn today, and the war situation is favorable to the Japanese army.

Havas Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 19th – President Vargas signed the Neutrality Act last night, announcing neutrality towards the war between the United Kingdom and Japan, and the war between the United Kingdom and Hungary, Romania, and Finland. Afterwards, foreign parties misinterpreted this in many ways. Responsible officials here expressed surprise upon hearing this, and said that Brazil's attitude has always been open and aboveboard. The new decree merely implements the decree that was already announced in September 1939. According to the provisions of that decree, Brazil maintains neutrality towards all wars that do not directly involve the American continent. This is not a general declaration of neutrality, because Brazil is the first country to declare an alliance with the United States and cannot adopt general neutrality. It is a misunderstanding to say that Brazil is also neutral towards the war between Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States.

Haitong Agency, Rio de Janeiro, 20th – An official report has just been received from Bogota stating that Colombia has severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy. Colombian Foreign Minister Pomboza has formally notified the German and Italian Ministers to Colombia of this matter.

### Singapore Communique States No Change on the Front Lines; British Deploy New Positions in Perak; Group of Military and Civilians Arrive in Singapore from Penang

Reuters, Singapore, 20th – Singapore authorities announced last night that there was no change in the war situation on the front lines.

Havas Agency, Singapore, 20th – Officials announced that there was no fighting on the Perak front today. British troops are deploying new positions there.

United Press International, London, 19th – The fall of Penang and the landing of Japanese troops in Hong Kong have indicated the urgency of the British position in the Far East. The British garrison in the remote areas of the Far East is disparate in number. As for reinforcements, although it is not impossible, it will be extremely difficult. It is generally expected that the British will do everything in their power to maximize the defense of Singapore. To achieve this goal, they may even disregard other territories of the United Kingdom and its allies in the Far East. The Japanese army's landings in various places seem to have rarely been obstructed. The Japanese army is now annexing strongholds one by one.

Havas Agency, London, 19th – At the meeting of the House of Commons today, a Member of Parliament inquired about the loss of British airfields in Malaya. The Under-Secretary of State for War, Sandys, replied that the government has done everything possible within the limits of our national strength to protect the airfields in Malaya. The reason for the loss was due to the overall advance of the Japanese army. As far as is known at present, these airfields were not specifically targeted for attack by the Japanese air force, so the situation is not comparable to the fall of Crete before August. All officers and soldiers responsible for defense did not neglect their duties.

Havas Agency, London, 20th – It has just been announced here by the relevant authorities that British troops have safely withdrawn from Penang in an orderly manner. Important military supplies were removed in advance, and those that remained were destroyed. British subjects who wished to leave have also been evacuated. Europeans who remain on the island have specifically requested to stay in place.

United Press International, Singapore, 19th – Military and civilians evacuated from Penang departed yesterday afternoon. Another group evacuated on the afternoon of the 17th. Among the first batch of evacuees were some police officers who arrived safely in Singapore. Their clothing was incomplete, which proves their hurried departure. Penang has been completely abandoned. The garrison, police, and volunteers have all withdrawn to the new defense line south of Perak.

### Young Reports Fierce Fighting Still in Hong Kong

Havas Agency, London, 20th – The Colonial Office received a telegram from Hong Kong Governor Young this morning stating that fierce fighting is still ongoing in Hong Kong.

Havas Agency, London, 19th – The news that Hong Kong has been occupied by the Japanese army cannot be confirmed or denied here. According to a communique issued by the Colonial Office, no news from Hong Kong has been received since yesterday morning.

Haitong Agency, Tokyo, 20th – British troops in Hong Kong have retreated to the Mount Davis battery and are now stubbornly defending Saffan Mountain in the east. British troops put up a stubborn resistance when they were driven out of Victoria and the Sterling colony. That area has been under constant Japanese artillery fire since Friday. Victoria is now on fire. Only a few British people are in the center of the city. Trucks with Japanese flags are traveling on the streets, carrying troops disarmed from the war zone.

Haitong Agency, Hanoi, 20th – A spokesman for the Japanese mission commented on the fate of Hong Kong, saying that it was regrettable that the Hong Kong authorities had refused Japan's request for surrender, as Japan's intention was solely to avoid unnecessary sacrifices by the people. The Hong Kong authorities should be responsible for the casualties among the Hong Kong civilians. Regarding the situation on the Malay Peninsula, the spokesman said that the Japanese army is advancing rapidly. According to Japanese soldiers who have fought in China for many years, the British army's combat capability is far below that of the Chinese army. The area along the Sino-Vietnamese border is now quite quiet, and China has not shown any signs of hostility.

Haitong Agency, Tokyo, 20th – "The Daily News" reported this morning that most of the Mount Davis battery and other British gun positions in Hong Kong were silent by Friday night. The oil depot near the Taikoo Wharf has been on fire since the afternoon of Thursday, with thick smoke covering the area. The headquarters of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has been destroyed by the fire. There are only a few British people in the city center. Trucks with Japanese flags are traveling on the streets, carrying troops disarmed from the war zone.

### National Assembly Opens in Lisbon; Portuguese Prime Minister Delivers Speech; Clarifying Determination to Safeguard Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity; Demanding Withdrawal of Australian and Dutch Troops from Timor

Havas Agency, Lisbon, 19th – The National Assembly convened today. Prime Minister Salazar immediately reported on the occupation of Portuguese Timor by British and Dutch forces. There are only 14 Japanese residents on the island.

Haitong Agency, Lisbon, 20th – In his speech to the National Assembly yesterday afternoon regarding the British military's intrusion into Portuguese Timor, Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar strongly stated that Britain had no right to intrude into the territory of a neutral, friendly country that was also its ally. The Prime Minister began his speech by reporting on two weeks of talks between the United Kingdom and Portugal. The talks discussed the issue of British troops entering the island to assist Portuguese forces if Portugal's sovereignty over Timor was violated by Japan. On December 5th, the Portuguese government refused to allow the Dutch government in London to participate in the talks, but agreed to exchange views with the Australian government. According to the agreement that could be reached after this round of talks, Australian and Dutch East Indies troops could only enter the island to protect it if Japan launched a surprise attack on Timor, and should withdraw as soon as the danger no longer existed. The Portuguese government was willing to agree to this suggestion from Britain, given the existence of the Anglo-Portuguese alliance. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army had not invaded Timor, but Australian aircraft had already attacked the capital of Timor on December 10th, 11th, and 12th. This move clearly violated Portuguese sovereignty. The Portuguese government immediately protested to the British government in London. Just as the British Ambassador to Portugal was conducting talks with the Portuguese authorities on the defense of Timor, the British Under-Secretary of State for War suddenly notified the Portuguese Ambassador to the United Kingdom that Australian and Dutch East Indies troops had already entered Timor. Although Portugal's capabilities are weak, it has refused to recognize Britain's right to send troops into Timor. In his meeting with me on December 17th, the British Ambassador claimed that Japanese submarines had been discovered outside the island of Timor, in an attempt to urge Portugal to seek assistance from Britain. The British Ambassador also tried to induce Portugal to issue a joint declaration with Britain, but was unable to provide evidence as to whether the Japanese attack on Portuguese territory was so imminent that it could not wait. I repeatedly stated Portugal's determination to safeguard territorial sovereignty and integrity. Britain should not repeatedly try to drag Portugal into the war. The Portuguese government only knows how to act with integrity and strive to fulfill its responsibilities. It may be difficult to take care of the interests of other foreign countries. Although Portugal will not forget the alliance with Britain, it believes that its sovereignty is above everything else. Negotiations with Britain will continue, and the government will inform the people of the results at any time.

United Press International, Lisbon, 19th – The Portuguese government has demanded that the Australian and Dutch governments withdraw Australian and Dutch troops from Timor.

Havas Agency, Madrid, 19th – Portuguese Ambassador to Spain Pereira visited Foreign Minister Suner today to inform him of the occupation of Portuguese Timor by British and Dutch forces, and said that the Portuguese government would demand that the British government withdraw its troops from the island.

### Vatican Personnel Concerned About the Timor Island Incident

Haitong Agency, Vatican City, 20th – The occupation of Timor Island by British and Dutch troops has caused great concern among Vatican personnel, who fear that the war will spread to the Iberian Peninsula. It has also been learned that the Ambassadors to the Holy See from Argentina, Brazil, and Chile visited Vatican Secretary of State Maglione yesterday.

Haitong Agency, Rome, 20th – Gaida wrote in yesterday's Italian News that the Portuguese government has encountered difficult problems. If Portugal tacitly recognizes the legality of the occupation of Timor Island, it may encourage other countries to engage in similar actions, causing all of Portugal's territories to face crises.

### Two General Assemblies Held at the Ninth Plenary Session; Listening to Reports on Party and Government Affairs from Various Provinces; Discussing Many Important Proposals

### The Soviet Union and Christianity (I)

The annual joyous festival—Christmas—is once again upon us. Brilliant scarlet poinsettias adorn the windows and corners, adding a solemn and beautiful touch. The candor, sincerity, and spirit of universal love from God fill everyone's hearts, allowing all to forget their troubles. The article "The Soviet Union and Christianity," which is published here, illustrates the greatness of God and the actual situation of the Soviet Union's legal protection of religious freedom. In this season when the joyous festival is about to descend, the publication of this article should also have considerable significance!

The renowned journalist Wallace Carroll, after traveling through Soviet Russia and the Middle East, wrote: "Stalin is the leader of a Russia without God, and this evening he will call upon God to bless President Roosevelt. This moving scene is not only unprecedented in the Kremlin but will also be impossible to witness again in the future."

One hundred British and American representatives, along with their Soviet colleagues, gathered in this ancient fortress. They had all heard of Stalin as the ruthless dictator of the Kremlin, known as the "Man of Steel." However, within these seven and a half hours, they saw another Stalin—a person, not steel, whom one American representative described as "a kind old gentleman with a benevolent face."

The massive crystal chandeliers radiated brilliant light, and the gold- and jewel-encrusted banquet hall was filled with admirals, generals, and other officers in full dress uniform, their chests covered with medals.

Stalin entered the hall, dressed in a simple, semi-military uniform, which he has worn since becoming a political commissar in the revolutionary army twenty-three years ago—a gray tunic, gray trousers tucked into the boots commonly worn by Red Army soldiers.

He seemed to pay no attention to the admirals and generals; he walked around the hall until he saw a face that caught his attention, then stopped to talk to that person.

Stalin sat at the head of the table, and the banquet began. They toasted each other, raising their glasses a total of thirty-one times, or perhaps thirty-seven, a slight discrepancy that is easily understood because Russians drink their toasts to the bottom. (To be continued)

### Food Supply Gradually Increases Thanks to the Authorities' Efforts; Six Rice and Flour Warehouses Have Been Opened; Supply of Meat and Vegetables Is Not a Concern; Relevant Parties Say Normalcy Can Be Restored Soon

The Rice and Grain Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) continued to operate all day yesterday, processing applications from various rice shops for transportation permits. Over a hundred rice dealers applied yesterday, with requests ranging from a few bags to dozens of bags, totaling around 2,000 bags. All were designated to be transported from the Mu Tai, Taikoo, and Xinyuan warehouses. In total, over the past three days, the Rice and Grain Office has issued transportation permits for over 20,000 bags of foreign rice from these three warehouses for retail sale.

Taikoo Back Warehouse Opened Yesterday

Taikoo’s No. 4 Front Warehouse had been opened once the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the No. 14 Back Warehouse facing Xinkai River was also opened, and various rice dealers are actively transporting rice. It is rumored that No. 2 Warehouse will also be opened today to facilitate rice transportation for dealers. The Roosevelt Warehouse, however, has not yet been opened.

Food Situation Can Return to Normal

An important official of the Shanghai Municipal Council stated yesterday that all the rice and flour stored in the city's warehouses, needed for the Council's immediate food distribution program, have been fully opened by the Japanese authorities. The food situation is expected to return to near normal within a few days. This is the first time since the beginning of the food emergency. Another favorable factor is the increase in fresh food, such as meat and vegetables, arriving from the interior. Currently, the supply of these fresh foods is even greater than before the outbreak of the Pacific War.

Concerns About Food Shortages Gradually Disappearing

The Council is currently expediting the transport of large quantities of foreign rice, issuing it to retail rice shops. Approximately 700 bags were issued on the 19th, which is the normal daily amount needed by the Public Concession. The Council is also supplying flour to retail stores and bakeries, so bread and other flour-based foods can now be produced. In short, all fears that the outbreak of the Pacific War would cause a food shortage in the city have been dispelled. The Council is currently maintaining food reserves through registration and banning the use of flour for luxury foods. Anyone hoarding and manipulating prices under the pretext of the current emergency situation will be punished.

Six Warehouses Have Been Opened

To date, about six large rice and flour warehouses have been opened, enabling the Council to immediately implement its food distribution program. The stocks in these opened warehouses are sufficient for more than a month. It is expected that the Japanese authorities will continue to open other warehouses when the distributed stocks are exhausted. However, the Council does not intend to directly sell rice and flour to citizens until it has confiscated large quantities of food from hoarders and manipulators. Flour has been ordered from the United States, but it may not be possible to transport it to Shanghai at present. In the past few days, vegetable oil has been shipped from North China to the city, which is of great help to the situation in the city. Several ships from neutral countries carrying maize and coal have also arrived in Shanghai, which has had a similar effect.

Approximate Figures for Citywide Rice Reserves

The Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association, upon instruction from the authorities, conducted a second registration of foreign rice stocks in warehouses among members of the trade from the 15th of this month. The deadline for registration ended on the 17th of this month. The total amount of rice and grain registered by rice merchants throughout the city reached 500,000 to 600,000 bags. Although civilian rice stocks are subject to registration restrictions, the amount is still considerable.

At the last discussion, approximately fifty prominent British and American nationals attended, candidly discussing the difficult problems currently facing Shanghai. Many of these problems have already been resolved, and efforts to find solutions to the remaining issues will continue.

### Private Car Ban Changed, to be Implemented on Tuesday

The Shanghai Municipal Council previously announced the restriction of private vehicle use. Due to the inability to issue permits to approved individuals before Monday, the regulations stipulated in the aforementioned announcement will now be implemented starting at 9:00 AM on Tuesday, December 23rd. Once approved and signed, permits can be collected at the Traffic Department of the Central Police Station at any time on Monday, December 22nd.

### Establishment of Indirect Postal Routes

It is learned that postal items to and from the southwest and northwest regions, previously routed through Hong Kong, have been rerouted via indirect transport, and there are no current difficulties. Routes for overseas mail transport have also been finalized, but it is not intended to publish them.

### Coal Supply from North China Arrives, Easing Fuel Panic; Large Quantities of Anthracite Coal En Route to Shanghai

The "Shan Tai Li" vessel, belonging to the Portuguese Shipping and Trading Company, arrived in Shanghai at dawn the day before yesterday from Tianjin and Qingdao. The vessel was carrying 600 tons of coal as a trial shipment to Shanghai. The cargo was unloaded and stored yesterday, and the vessel is planning to continue exporting and loading anthracite coal for shipment to Shanghai to regulate supply. According to another source, a large quantity of anthracite coal is currently en route to Shanghai and will arrive soon. Therefore, there is no concern about a shortage of coal supply in the city. Moreover, reserves are substantial and are being strictly managed, so coal market transactions should return to normal.

### Merchants and Residents Must Complete Stock Registration Within the Deadline; Those with No Deadline Specified in the Shanghai Municipal Council Notice Must Also Report Promptly

According to a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council, the notice issued by the highest-ranking officer of the Japanese Army regarding the registration of stocks does not mean that such stocks do not need to be registered with the Council. All items that are required to be reported according to the Council's notices must be completed within the deadline. If no deadline is specified in the notice, reports must be submitted to the Council as soon as possible without delay.

### Many Changes in Locations Where Foreign Ships are Docked in the Huangpu River

On the Yangtze River, only Japanese ships sail along the downstream Jiangbei and Chongming areas. Aside from Japanese ships, merchant ships such as the North China and North Kang maintain services along the northern route. Southern routes are also completely suspended. In the Yangjingbang and Huangpu river areas, buoys were previously set up by the British, American, French and Japanese navies for

Warships of Various Countries

To moor. Italian warships were assigned buoys number 1 and 2 on the Huangpu River east of the Garden Bridge as docking locations. Subsequently, the Japanese Navy's 3rd Fleet flagship, Izumo, moved from the designated Japanese Navy buoy in the Huangpu River off Xinkai River to the Mitsubishi Wharf in front of the Japanese Consulate. Now it has been changed to the China Merchants Bureau's Middle Warehouse Wharf. The British Navy buoy in the Yangjingbang-Huangpu River area originally docked the American gunboat Wake. The American Navy buoy docked the British gunboat Petrel. Since the morning of the 8th, the British warship Petrel was sunk. The American warship Wake moved to Yangshupu, and the French warship Pallas was moved to South Huangpu. Therefore, recently from the Garden Bridge and all the way to No. 16 Dock

There are No Foreign Warships

Docking on that stretch of the river. There are a total of three Italian ships stationed in Shanghai. The light cruiser Eritrer and the gunboat E. Carlotta are docked at the same 1 and 2 buoys. Yesterday afternoon, the cruiser moved to the British Navy buoy in front of the Yangjingbang-Huangpu River. The gunboat Cloto sailed to the Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochang Temple yesterday morning for repairs. The gunboat Lepante, which had previously been under repair at the Jiangnan Shipyard, sailed out yesterday morning after the work was completed and is now docked at the Garden Bridge Pier. The Russian ship that arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 8th has not yet left and is still docked at buoys 27 and 28.

### New Director of the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, Mr. Lufft, Will Resign; Harbormaster Mr. Trepka Dismissed

### Record of Lectures by the Rong Wu Society

The 27th lecture of the Rong Wu Scripture Reading Society was given by Mr. Shen Jueling on the topic of "We Confucians Should Emulate Confucius' Idea of Education for All and Jointly Shoulder the Responsibility of Harmonizing the Five Religions," in which he discussed sections 5 and 6. He said that at the beginning of the founding of the Republic of China, the provisional president, Sun Yat-sen, formerly a Christian, not only promulgated the freedom of religious belief for the people in the provisional constitution, but also hand-copied the Li Yun section of the Book of Rites, "When the Grand Course was pursued, a public and common spirit ruled all under the sky..." to the first page of the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction when he retired and lived in Shanghai, announcing it to China and the world. This is clear evidence of the natural harmonization of the five religions, and Confucius's doctrine of the Great Harmony is the culmination of harmonization. The Analects of Confucius, in the Shu Er section, states, "Confucius said, 'When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers. I will select their good qualities and follow them, their bad qualities and correct them.'" I humbly extend this meaning to say that the five religions coexist in China, and their followers are all my friends. I will select the good qualities of their teachings and follow them. Since we know that Confucius's doctrine of the Great Harmony is the culmination of harmonizing the five religions, we know that Confucius's Way will inevitably be practiced throughout the world. The deceit and suspicion that exist between countries today will be enlightened by Confucius's words and they will change course, all converging on the path of the Great Learning, to illustrate illustrious virtue, renovate the people, and rest in the highest excellence. Then the world will be truly like brothers, and then gradually achieve the Great Harmony that Confucius aspired to, and then realize Confucius's great wish of education for all and reap its great benefits. Mencius, in the Wan Zhang section, does he not say, "Confucius was the one who appeared at the proper time"? We admire Confucius's teachings, aspire to Confucius's ambitions, and deeply believe that Confucius's Way is suitable for any era. The five religions are harmonized by Confucius's Way. Now is the time! Now is the time! We should approach it with the utmost sincerity of being selfless and willing to share goodness with others. The Great Learning quotes the Kang Gao using the phrase "As cherishing a little child," and explains its meaning by saying, "When there is sincerity of heart in seeking it, though it may not hit the mark exactly, we shall not be far from doing so. There never has been a case of one first learning to nourish a child, and then getting married." Is this a joke? It means that by extending the sincerity of cherishing a little child, the child can be raised even without specifically nurturing it. Such is the utmost sincerity. We should regard all people as little children and constantly reflect on ourselves at all times and in all places, saying, "I am also a human being. Humans love each other, that is natural." The Analects, in the Xue Er section, says, "Love all men fraternally and cultivate friendship with the good." The Classic of Filial Piety, in the Three Powers section, says, "First, use broad love, so that among the people none are left out from being treated with affection." The Greatness of Confucian teachings lies in this. Based on this idea and seeking with sincerity, extend the principle of mutual love between people, to its fullest extent, embracing the capacity of nurturing all things without harming each other and allowing different paths to be pursued without conflicting with each other. Use this to spark the harmonization of the five religions, and the Great Harmony of the world will not be far off. Then, Mr. Yao Taiping, an expert on the Classic of Filial Piety, lectured on saving the world with the Classic of Filial Piety, explaining in great detail the meaning of the first chapter of the Classic of Filial Piety, "The Ultimate Virtue and Essential Way," as well as the idea of harmony among the people, harmony between superiors and subordinates, and no resentment. The event ended at 4 p.m.

Scene from the Isolated Island

### Night in Shanghai

— Wei Ge

Shanghai, along with London and New York, is known as one of the most important metropolises in the world. After the war, Shanghai's population is concentrated, and on the surface, it is still bustling, with bright lights and bustling nightlife, not losing its character as a "ten-mile foreign concession." However, the situation of being outwardly strong but inwardly weak is already impossible to conceal. After this Pacific War’s fire spread here, even the appearance has faded from splendor to dimness. Taking a stroll on the streets at night, the street lights and shadows of people are few and far between, indicating that the prosperity of the past can only be a nostalgic thought.

Originally, Shanghai's prosperity was built on its nightlife. The flow of people on the streets and the shuttling of vehicles were all rushing to banquets and entertainment. Singing and dancing prevailed, and people indulged in enjoyment. Taverns and restaurants were all full, and cinemas and dance halls were overcrowded. Now, after ten o'clock, pedestrians are scarce on all roads; after the reduction of public transportation, private cars are gradually dwindling, even to the point of disappearing altogether; film sources for cinemas have become a problem, with most showing second-run or later films, and in the future, they may even show all propaganda films. Thus, the days of hanging a "full house" sign have become a thing of the past. In dance halls, because most people are preoccupied with making a living and transportation is inconvenient, and there is much fear in traveling at night, they have suffered a great impact. The few couples scattered on the dance floor, and the excited jazz music, can no longer stir up the interest of the dancers. The stars sit quietly, sadly lamenting the difficult days ahead.

On several streets, lower-class "goddesses" shiver in the cold night, waiting expectantly. Occasionally, a pedestrian pulls up their coat collar, lowers their hat, and walks past, still having to be wary of a sudden attack from a dark alley. If an old hat is lost, a new one cannot be afforded. Occasionally, several rickshaws pass by with the sound of "tuk-tuk," breaking the silence of the streets. The rickshaw puller may be thinking while pulling that although the fare has slightly increased, the cost of rice alone for the family is five yuan a day. There is no one in front of the rice store, and the iron gates are tightly closed. The queue for buying rice during the day will reappear tomorrow morning. The countless footprints of those seeking a living, imprinted on the concrete sidewalk, are scars of the utmost human misery. Before the night is deep, the neon lights have disappeared, and the shadows on the advertisement billboards appear blurry. Although their low smiles and soft frowns are as before, no pedestrian has the mood to glance at them anymore.

The annual Christmas holiday and the consecutive New Year's Day were originally anticipated by many people. Beforehand, department stores were crowded with people buying gifts and New Year's goods. At that time, all entertainment venues would celebrate all night long. It was truly a celebration for all, and everyone was happy. But this year's situation is completely different from the past. Rice and coal are not easy to buy, so where is there any mood for celebration? I am afraid that when Christmas Eve arrives, we will have to spend it with frowning faces.

Shanghai has lost its prosperous nights. Anyone who passes through the streets at night will have this feeling!

### Rice from Binbei Blocked at the Bridge: Difficult to Buy Rice, Difficult to Store Rice; What Can Be Done?

Yesterday's domestic rice trading was quiet. Although the French Concession offered a price of 261 yuan for Bo He Dao, there were very few transactions. Moreover, most of the goods in the British Concession came from Binbei, but due to the bridge being blocked, the arrival of goods was cut off. Therefore, the price of Bo He Dao in the British Concession was 255 yuan for those who managed to transport it in, but only 240 yuan for those who had not. Thick Geng lacked goods and there was no market. The total arrival of sources yesterday was only about 100 stones. Foreign rice was sold at a flat price, but there was quite a crowd. Some waited all day and still could not buy rice. Although Taikoo Warehouse has been opened, only the municipal bureau's publicly sold rice can be released. As for rice merchants releasing goods, it has not yet been realized. However, merchants storing rice for their own consumption, not for hoarding and profiteering, is not included in the prohibition. However, unfortunately, they are still subject to inspection and confiscation. It is difficult to buy rice and difficult to store rice. What can be done? It is truly incomprehensible. Only after the flat-price is slightly increased, its wholesale price is also increased at the same time. For several weeks, rumors have been circulating that the municipal bureau will buy all the warehouse rice for flat-price sales, which seems to be gradually approaching. According to rice industry news, holders are very willing to sell the original package at the previously announced price of 158 yuan and 95 cents, because this price is still lower than the current wholesale price. The Nanshi Wu Jian flat-price rice is also being sold, and there are also military ticket rice points, which can stabilize the situation slightly. However, the source of domestic rice is temporarily blocked again, which will slightly affect the people's food. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the authorities will understand the difficulties of the people and generously distribute it so that normal transportation can be resumed. Although the number is limited, it will still be a small supplement to the entire food supply in Shanghai.

Miscellaneous Grains with Uneven, Unstable Market

Yesterday's miscellaneous grains still had only sporadic transactions, with prices varying and lacking a stable market. The details are as follows: 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were priced at 370 yuan. 100 dan of Qing oil from the Dayou factory were priced at 232 yuan. 200 dan of rapeseed oil from the Taishan factory were priced at 240 yuan to 254 yuan. 250 yuan for rapeseed oil from the Dasheng factory. 300 bags of Tianjin Xin Jinyuan were priced at 99 to 97 yuan. Also, 100 bags of Qingdou were priced at 90 yuan. 200 bags of Saigon Xin Bao rice were priced at 54 yuan, and 52 yuan for He Lan Huang Bao rice.

### Gold Supply Exceeds Demand: Falls to the Edge of 10,000 Yuan Mark

The price of each bar of cash (10 taels) is falling sharply. There are more rumors about unfavorable gold speculation, and it is also heard that money changers are urging the redemption of gold mortgages. Amid the sound of real goods being released, the price has fallen sharply to the edge of the 10,000 yuan mark. People from all sides are in a state of panic. From early morning, in a situation of supply exceeding demand, the price was shouted down to within 12,000 yuan, and continued to be shouted down. Firstly, a profit was sold to Jingfu for 10 taels at a price of 11,000 yuan. A certain gold shop offered 10 taels of Chengji for 10,800 yuan. Money exchangers competed to offer on behalf of wealthy individuals. A certain gold shop offered a bill of exchange for 10 taels to a merchant, lowering the price to 10,500 yuan. Chengji Gold Shop advanced 80 taels to money houses, raising the price from 10,400 yuan to 10,550 yuan, but later could not support it. In the midst of selling, it continued to plummet. A certain gold shop advanced another 10 taels to a customer, the lowest being 10,300 yuan. At noon, a certain gold shop and a certain bank saw the low price and absorbed it, so it rebounded to 10,610 yuan, with 10 taels being traded. Finally, it was around 10,700 yuan, a further drop of 1,500 yuan from the previous day. In two weeks, it has fallen by a total of over 3,100 yuan. The transaction price on that day varied by as much as 700 yuan. The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at Yinlou Dashin and other shops was lowered by 50 yuan at 10:30 AM, another 50 yuan at 10:50 AM, and again by 50 yuan at 11:30 AM, falling to 1,200 yuan (buying in at around 1,000 yuan), a drop of 150 yuan. Textured silver was not quoted until after 11:30 AM, when it was quoted at 18 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan. The black market price has fallen to 11-12 yuan, a drop of 1 yuan.

The discount rate for remittances and drafts continued to decrease to flat or even 5 yuan per thousand, a drop of 3 yuan.

The Japanese military ticket market has not yet resumed business. The quoted price outside the market is about 3 yuan and 8 jiao. The price of US dollar tickets has fallen below 19 yuan due to the sharp drop in the cash price, with buyers only offering 18 yuan and 5 jiao. Hong Kong tickets have fallen to 3 yuan and 2 jiao and 3 cents, but even at this price, there are few takers.

### Spot Yarn Trading: Mostly Japanese Yarn

The Yarn Industry Association's spot yarn market has a part that gathers in the market to meet, regulate goods for transaction, Japanese yarn is more, people's hearts are relatively calm, but the market is falling, 20-count Tiannu yarn floor spot price traded at 2,400 yuan, transacted 10 packages, other Japanese yarn transacted 2-30 packages, 42-count Lanfeng roughly in the transaction before the day before, there are goods and then goods, no goods both parties priced to settle, in order to clear procedures, the price is about 4,000 yuan to 3,990 yuan, now list the spot yarn sold out,

Shuangma Factory single market trend fell, traded ten packages in the yarn cloth exchange, the price was 1,860 yuan, the buyer is to cover the short, then after the market price rebounded, 1,900 yuan, some people want to enter but lack sellers, not traded,

### Public Debt Little Transaction: Officially Resumes Business on Monday

Public debt off-exchange transactions, the market price suddenly appeared chaotic, still difficult to sell, as soon as there is a buyer, then the sellers pick up, people's hearts always feel weak, so that settlement of transactions often can not be completed, so yesterday's transaction number is very small, buyers must also have the same number of sellers to exchange conditions, so the transaction is even rarer, C began to do as six Bu four yuan five corners then gradually declined to four yuan, still has sixty-three yuan seven eight corners for sale, due to lack of receivers, no transaction, A began to do as sixty-nine Yun six corners and a half, down to nine yuan two corners, B began to do five yuan two corners, the last is four yuan six corners, E only has sellers but no receivers, so no transaction, in this case, I am afraid it will continue to decline, the market announcement, quasi twenty-second Monday resumption of business, but only do a morning plate, the time is from half-past nine to ten, this kind of expedient measure is quite timely, because after ten o'clock the settlement of the day can be clear and appropriate in the bank collection time also,

### Edible Sugar Only Sporadic Transactions

Dutch coarse white is more flat because there are more goods in this store and more scattered hand goods are seeking to sell, so the price is quite flat, it is recently heard that the street transaction is less than 230 yuan, but Dutch red is higher than coarse white because of the lack of goods, exceeding 30 yards, while car white is only 20 yards higher than red sand, still only a small number of imports and exports,

### Red and Black Dates Still Actively Selling

Red and black dates, because they are ordinary tonics in winter, and the prices are still flat, and they are also resistant to hunger, there is a possibility of replacing food, so sales are still active, such as Boping black date king recently opened 300 yuan to 310 yuan, and jujube head 250 yuan, Tou Gao Zhuang 2230 yuan, unified hand 180 yuan, Tianjin red date king 175 yuan, date head 155 yuan, Touhu 130 yuan, Erhu, 110 yuan, unified hand Cangzhou red "120 yuan, Zoufu red sold 95 yuan, Changhong 70 yuan, Mayazao 140 yuan,

### Tea (7)

— Gao Jiannong

It is strange to say that the popularization of tea to the northern part of our country was because the young monks of Lingyan Temple in Mount Tai wanted to use it to drive away sleep, while its introduction to Western Europe was by the strength of another religion, and with the same purpose. It is truly a coincidence. Originally, since the Jesuit missionary Li Madou from Italy came to China in 1581 AD, many other missionaries followed suit, going to various places to preach. Among the sacraments of the church is the so-called "confession," which is a rite in which missionaries quietly listen to the repentance of their sins by the parishioners and then comfort them. This work, especially when there are many parishioners, can be extended for a long, long time. You can imagine how monotonous, boring, and annoying it must be. The "old priests" sometimes cannot help but have a "whim, sleepy eyes hazy." It was to invigorate themselves and overcome sleep that they learned that drinking tea could produce wonderful effects. Tea was then transported to Western Europe around 1602 AD through their efforts. (To be continued)

### "Out of Car"

— Liao Ran

According to a notice issued by the Public Works Department: It is decided that from 9:00 AM on the 22nd of this month, all private cars, except in special circumstances, will not be allowed to drive within the concession.

In recent days, due to the gasoline supply, white-牌牌 cars have already ceased operations, and black-牌 cars on the road are also quite scarce. The above decision of the authorities was also expected. It is not easy for ordinary people to live in Chang'an; it is also difficult for wealthy people to travel in Chang'an. Although the natural feet of a group of young masters and misses are the same as everyone else, they are difficult to walk, and from now on, the life of "strolling" seems to be able to "converge." However, the environment still allows you to take a chartered car, as long as enough conditions can feed an "Ah San," otherwise, if the food at home is not enough for a month, Ah San can be a mixed rice strongman in the long snake formation.

Perhaps the chartered car is empty. Then rickshaw. Tell you: I witnessed a happy family on Huanghe Road who let the bride put on a rickshaw to "return to her mother's home," the scene was a bit ferocious, inevitably there is a "pediatric" feeling; however, in this place wrapped in a kesting overcoat handsome young man and his missus will also pantingly bear half a load of filthy briquettes. This is called "sixty years of feng shui turns" (?) on the Shanghai "beach" is such a look.

The rickshaw is not fast enough, nor is it a big school; the car lacks oil can not call the cattle to tow, it is expected that the carriage will be held out one day (perhaps today). The road is exactly the old thing in front of Zhang Yuan's door decades ago. Not plotting to see the Han officials again today, how lucky!

But the horse's feed is to prepare some, and to prepare well, which is also expected. Otherwise, the horse may sometimes turn over with your wife in the road, please you sit in the ambulance to pass the addiction.

### "Husband" of Time: Talking About Chartered Car Drivers

— Jin Lu

Among the "husband" generation, of course! The chauffeur is the eldest brother. Dudu dududu --, press a few horns, but now, the oil is gone, it seems that there is not much strength to drive. So chartered car drivers are in charge. In the eyes of others, they are at least one level higher than rickshaw drivers. Needless to say: they eat well; live comfortably; dress neatly; and run less distance. And; unlike rickshaw drivers, they don't have to memorize the names of all the places in Shanghai in their stomachs and slip them on their tongues.

To be a chartered car driver, more important than eating is to pull "steadily," so that the people in the car can close their eyes and fall asleep. Of course, this all depends on the "eleven pairs"—the mutual connection of both hands and feet. Otherwise, you will be stopped from doing business and break your rice bowl!

The life of a chartered car driver is troublesome to death: in the morning, he has to take the young masters and misses to school to study. When he comes back, he takes the old master to the "treasure number". When he comes back again, the wife has just gotten up, stepped on the chartered car, and the nanny has already put the scale and vegetable basket on the foot of the "third-class car", so, without waiting for instructions, he flies his legs and pulls into the vegetable market.

When the car comes back, these days, for the sake of everyone's meal, he has to squeeze on the hunger line with the nanny—rice. This good errand is more strenuous than "running away". If you can't buy three liters of rice, the wife will inevitably shout with blue veins. We eat more rice, so we should "atone for our sins"; however, it is often so, the consequences are unimaginable, it is better to roll up the bedding and sleep in heaven.

Usually, after eating dinner, there is nothing to do, sit down, calmly, and chat and laugh with the nannies and big sisters, which is the greatest comfort of the day. Sometimes, taking advantage of the return trip, you can also earn some "extra money" and buy some wine to drink. Not bragging, there are young masters and misses who want to take advantage of this kind of chartered car and knock on a "bamboo pole". It is easy to get, and no one has ever haggled the price; and, the face is always smiling, showing that (she) is also in the "chartered car class".

However, the extraordinary period of these days is really terrible, eating dinner, and then go to buy rice is not to mention, but also have to buy half a load of briquettes, although the hands and feet are strong, nine deaths and one life, squeezed to the door is already dawn, carrying back home can only collapse on the door panel.

Chartered car drivers have too many such "side jobs".

### A Year's Needs

— Xu

A poor man complained to a rich man about the difficulty of life, and the rich man became impatient and casually took a package from the silver box and threw it on the desk, saying, "Take it! This should be enough for your needs for a year, right?" The poor man touched the thick package, estimating that it would probably last more than a year, and could not help but shed tears of gratitude, and hurriedly bowed like a puppet, backing out with his head down. Back home, pressing his leaping heart, he tremblingly unwrapped the paper package and took a look: "Ah! It's a calendar!"

Time: 8:00 AM.

Student A: (Standing up) Teacher, I need to take a day off.

Teacher: (Serious) Why?

Student A: (Calm attitude) My mother told me to wait in line to buy coal briquettes.

Teacher: (Thinking briefly) Okay, okay. (Student A leaves the room hurriedly, Student B stands up next.)

Student B: Teacher, I also need to take a leave of absence, a long leave.

Teacher: (Surprised) Why?

### Qiu Haitang

— Qin Shouou

Fifteen: Papa, let’s go sing for a living!

After Mei Bao finished this long speech with excitement, she fixed her gaze firmly on her father, awaiting his reply.

However, Qiu Haitang really did not know what to say for a moment.

Although he had not personally experienced this kind of occupation, judging from what Mei Bao said, he could already see a major drawback, which was that the form was too unrefined, with something of the air of a prostitute going out to an engagement. This was what he was extremely unwilling to do. But when it came to earning money, this was undoubtedly the simplest occupation, requiring no capital investment.

“Papa, if you’re worried that the guests will be noisy when we’re singing, I’ll take care of that myself!” Mei Bao also understood why her father was hesitating and not speaking. “I’ve thought it over carefully these past few nights. As long as we don’t covet petty gains, and I know how to be dignified when I meet people, there’s nothing to worry about! As the saying goes, flies don’t enter eggs without cracks, what are we afraid of?”

“It’s just…” Qiu Haitang really didn’t know what to decide.

“Besides, Papa, you’re always with me!” Mei Bao added.

“Since you say so, and we have no other way right now, we’ll just have to give it a try, but…” He raised his head and thought for a minute or two. “But it’s best to mention it as little as possible in front of others, it’s ultimately not a respectable thing!”

“Who would I blab to!” Mei Bao retorted with a laugh.

Arts and Entertainment World

### Random Notes on Entertainment: Comic Plays

— Zefu

Everyone knows that the comic plays currently popular in Shanghai were first created by Wang Wuneng, but in fact, this type of play was already prevalent in our country during the Tang and Song dynasties, and was a precursor to our country's true drama. However, at that time, this type of play did not yet have the name of "comic play." In the Tang dynasty, it was called "Nong Canjun," and in the Song dynasty, it was generally called "za ju" or "za xi." The performers were usually two people, one acting as Canjun (military advisor) and the other as Canghu (falcon). Li Shangyin's poem "Jiao'er" (Spoiled Child) says, "Suddenly learns Canjun, pressing voice and calling Canghu," which is what it refers to. The plays performed also had no story to speak of, generally improvising actions or satirizing current events, with humor as the main focus. For example, during the Xiantong era of the Tang dynasty, there was an actor named Li Keji who was good at performing this type of play. Once, during the Yanqing Festival, after the monks and Taoists finished their lectures, it was the actors' turn to perform. Li Keji, wearing Confucian clothing and a turban, and a wide-sleeved robe, ascended the lecture platform and called himself the "Three Teachings Equilibrium." The person sitting in the corner asked, since he was proficient in the three teachings, what kind of people were Sakyamuni, Laozi, and Confucius? Li Keji replied, "All women." The questioner was surprised and asked, "Why?" He replied, "The Diamond Sutra says, 'Spreading the seat and sitting.' If not women, why bother the husband sitting before the child sitting! The Tao Te Ching says, 'I have a great worry, which is that I have a body; and when I have no body, what worry do I have?' If not women, why worry about being pregnant! The Analects says, 'Sell it, sell it! I am waiting for a buyer.' If not women, what am I waiting to marry for!" (See Gao Yanxiu's Tang Que Shi). This is all using the homophones of words to make twisted explanations, just like the jokes of today's comedians.

### Talents Cultivated by Opera Schools (Part 1)

— Yan Xi

The Shanghai Drama School already enjoys a considerable reputation in the Shanghai Peking Opera scene. Its various public performances have all received good reviews. The school has approximately one hundred students, a veritable gathering of talent. Now, I will offer a brief introduction to the school's students from my personal perspective.

(A) Male Students:

Guan Zhengming – Possesses an excellent singing voice and a beautiful stage presence. It is a pity his voice is somewhat narrow, resembling that of a female role. He sometimes takes shortcuts and is lazy. I am particularly pleased with his performances in "The Empty City Stratagem" and "Pan Guan of the Fiery Bull Formation."

Zhou Zhengrong – Has a high and bright voice, with spirited eyes and sophisticated singing. Because Guan Zhengming has taken over many of his roles, he has few leading roles. His performances as Liu Bei in "Changban Slope," "Beheading the Yellow Robe," and "Beheading His Son at the辕门 Gate" are satisfying.

Chen Zhengyan – Has a voice that is old and flavorful, which Guan and Zhou lack. However, he is not as flexible in his vocal delivery as Guan and Zhou. His most popular performances are as Zhao Kuangyi in "Scolding the Palace," "Entering the Palace Twice," and "Reporting Strange Grievances," because his voice is well-suited for singing Erhuang melodies.

Martial Male Roles:

Wang Zhengkun – Has a good voice, good looks, and excellent legwork, so he is highly praised. His movements are clean and crisp, his gestures are forceful but not exaggerated, so he excels in both long-robed and short-fighting roles.

Liu Zhengzhong – Can be considered a worthy rival to Wang Zhengkun. The difference is that he excels in short-fighting roles over long-robed roles.

Young Male Roles:

Xue Zhengkang – His gestures are meticulous and elegant, but he is not suitable for singing Hongsheng (painted-face male) roles. His masterpiece is "A Fortunate Marriage."

Martial Young Male Roles:

Liu Zhengyi – Although he has few roles, his performance is not bad. "The Eight Great Hammers" and "Elegant Viewing Tower" are both worth seeing.

(B) Female Roles:

Gu Zhengqiu – Is the student with the greatest appeal in the entire school. Indeed, her art is excellent. For example, in "A Fortunate Marriage," she is able to grasp the identity and personality of the concubine. Her body and face are expressive, and her movements are graceful. Naturally, the audience applauds and cheers wildly.

Zhang Zhengfang – Has good looks and lively and lovable gestures. Again, taking "A Fortunate Marriage" as an example, her dialogue is so pleasing to the ear, but unfortunately, her voice is too soft when singing. Otherwise, her portrayal of the matchmaker Liu in "Fa Men Si" is also good.

Old Female Roles:

Zhu Zhengqin – Looks like an old woman, making her most suitable for playing old female roles. Her best roles are vocal performances, such as "Slippery Oil Mountain" and "Fishing for a Golden Turtle."

Hollywood astrologer Joan Howard predicts that Ginger Rogers will have great fortune at the end of next year, and everything will go smoothly. The above picture is a recent photo of her.

### Storytelling at Zhang Garden

— Keren

After seeing Mr. Zhang Jianfan's "Storytelling Venue at Zhang Garden" in this publication, because it aligned with my ideal, I went several times with some storytelling fans and found it very satisfying. Of all the storytelling venues in Shanghai now, none can compare to Zhang Garden in its simple elegance, refinement, and cultured taste. Several storytellers perform daily, and although some are junior members of the Guangyu Society, their storytelling skills are excellent. The Zhang brothers' performance of "Ten Beauties" during the day can be said to be unique in Shanghai. Pang Xie's "Golden Fan" is not far from the performances of Jiang and Zhu. Wu Zian's "Sui and Tang Dynasties Revealed" has just the right amount of humor, befitting the son of a general. Shen Jian'an's "Pearl Pagoda" is vivid and lifelike, but unfortunately, his assistant Li Nian'an is slightly to the left, only able to play and sing, lacking enough humor. In the evening, Hou Shen's "Pearl Pagoda" is quite energetic, though inevitably excessive. Liu Xie's "Three Smiles" covers all aspects of playing, singing, and humor. Especially his assistant, Xie Yuqing, is a rare and talented individual. Wang Yunfeng's "Golden Spear" is performed with consummate skill, reaching a perfect state. The Lu family, father and son, in "Dragonfly," vividly describe the characters, capturing their essence. Whether playing male, female, or comedic roles, they are all lifelike. Their musical accompaniment is steady and clear. Their few words of local dialect are accurate and well-rounded, especially their Beijing dialect, which even some of the storytellers from the Guangyu Society can hardly match. The only drawback of the venue is that there are not many seats, unable to accommodate a large number of listeners. If the weather is bad and it rains heavily, the sound is like thunder, making it difficult to hear the storyteller on stage. Because the roof is made of lead sheeting, miscellaneous noises are unavoidable.

### New Information from the Art World

— Yi

"New Fisherman's Song" is selling extremely well. Zhu Shilin, the host of Dachen Film Company, has decided to co-direct a film with the film's director, Tu Guangqi. The script is also by Tu.

The script is also planned to be changed to "Fragrant Letter Tears," which is currently being performed at the Tiangong Theater. Because the play

The Hongying Drama Society is currently actively rehearsing Ma Xu Weibang's "Midnight Song," directed by Wang Zhuyou, which will be performed at the New Russian Theater.

### Crimson Petals in a Bloody Rain

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 20: The Wax Candle Welcomes Them to the Battlefield

Just as a Qing soldier was parrying Liu Yinying's sword, he was flustered. Xu Jing took the opportunity to stab him from behind, the sword piercing his chest, and he fell dead on the ground. Only one wounded Qing soldier remained, trying to escape, stealing a glance at the door to flee. How could Liu Yinying let him escape? He shouted, "Where do you think you're going?" and quickly caught up, thrusting his sword, hitting him squarely in the buttocks. Xu Jing rushed forward and added another stab, and the Qing soldier died by the blade. The two had eliminated the Qing soldiers, and the pent-up anger in their hearts felt somewhat relieved. They went back into the room. The young woman had come down from the bed. Seeing the two, she knew they had come to save her. She knelt down on both knees, kowtowing to thank them. The two did not want to linger, picked up the head from the ground, held it in their hands, and each dragged two Qing soldiers' corpses, quietly leaving the house. Fortunately, there was no one on the street. They walked forward and saw a small river, the water gurgling. The two quickly threw the four corpses into the river with a "plop, plop." Turning around, they saw a tall willow tree by the river. Liu Yinying leaped up and hung the head at the highest point of the willow branch, like a lantern, spinning in the wind. He expected the Qing soldiers to be surprised when they discovered it tomorrow. Liu Yinying then floated down, using his sword to quickly carve a line of words on the tree: "Adulterers will be executed." Turning his head, he smiled at Xu Jing and said, "We'll just scribble a few words in the dark." Xu Jing said, "Good job, brother. Let's go, lest we run into Qing soldiers and cause trouble." Liu Yinying agreed, and the two returned, jumped on their mounts, and quickly returned to the camp to rest. (245)
