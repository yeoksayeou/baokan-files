Foreign Minister Guo's Remarks

United Press, Chongqing, 18th: Foreign Minister Dr. Guo Taiqi told United Press reporters today that Tojo's assumption of the Japanese premiership indicates that Japan is preparing to take action. We firmly believe that Tojo's rise to power indicates that Japan will attack the Soviet Union. Guo pointed out that he had said that Konoe's second cabinet was only a temporary transitional cabinet, allowing the military to fully prepare for future actions. Now the Japanese military has removed its mask and decided to openly handle affairs themselves. Guo also said that Japan may continue to use sweet words to steadily deal with Britain and the United States, hoping that its actions will not be interfered with by the two countries, and believes that the two countries will not actively assist the Soviet Union. He also said that, in a sense, Tojo's rise to power is a good thing, as those directly responsible for Japanese policy are finally publicly responsible. When the Foreign Minister discussed Japan's decision to attack the Soviet Union and compared it with Italy's attack on France when Paris fell, he said that the two events had some similarities, but he did not believe that this comparison was accurate. He said, "At that time, the war in France was nearing its end, but today's Soviet Union will obviously continue to fight. Furthermore, if Japan attacks the Soviet Union, I do not believe that Britain and the United States will remain completely on the sidelines." He reiterated that the Chinese people do not believe that Tojo's replacement of Konoe is sufficient to indicate any thorough change in Japanese policy. He said that this is only an increase in speed. Guo pointed out that the economic sanctions imposed by democratic countries on Japan, and the fact that Japanese industry, despite being subjected to Fascist control, has still failed to achieve the desired results, have made Japan no longer hope to find greater efficiency, as this matter is extremely unfavorable to them.

Havas News Agency, Chongqing, 18th: Observers close to the government, commenting on Tojo's cabinet formation, said that there is no doubt that Japan is gradually moving towards launching a Pacific war, but it will not immediately attack Siberia. Therefore, Tojo's cabinet cannot yet be regarded as a wartime cabinet. As for the US-Japan talks, they will inevitably be affected. The Central Daily News asserted that since Tojo has repeatedly supported Konoe's cabinet formation, there will be no change in the new cabinet's diplomatic strategy, but it will perform a double act, with radicals roaring and jumping around internally, while Tojo will put on a show of force to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, threatening and intimidating, but in reality, it is just a paper tiger.

### Formation of the New Japanese Cabinet; List of Cabinet Members Announced Yesterday; Tojo Concurrently Holds Interior and Army Portfolios; Togo as Foreign Minister, Shimada as Navy Minister

Japanese Official Says Basic Policies Will Not Change

Tokyo, 18th: After completing the formation of his cabinet, Tojo entered the palace at 2:00 PM today to meet with the Emperor and present the list of cabinet members. The Emperor, accompanied by incumbent Cabinet member Hashida, Minister of Education, attended the Prime Ministerial appointment ceremony at the Phoenix Pavilion at 3:00 PM. The Emperor bestowed the Imperial rescript of appointment to Tojo as Prime Minister, which was presented by the Minister of Education. This was followed by the appointment ceremony for the new Prime Minister concurrently holding the posts of Minister of Interior and Minister of the Army. At 4:00 PM, the Emperor again resided at the Phoenix Pavilion and held the appointment ceremony for each cabinet member. The resignations of the five incumbent cabinet members, including Hashida, Minister of Education, were immediately returned. Thus, Tojo's new cabinet was declared established. At 5:00 PM, the first cabinet meeting was convened. The list of the new cabinet is as follows: the cabinet is a possible war cabinet", but its precise political qualities are not yet fully clear. The retention of former literary cabinet members is largely seen as being for the sake of convenience in handling affairs and has little to do with policy. In any case, this has been offset by Tojo's holding of three positions simultaneously. In short, the observations of British and American diplomats on the future seem to lean slightly towards pessimism.

United Press, Tokyo, 18th: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo stated today when announcing his policies that "the path Japan should follow has already been decided." He also said that he fully believes that diplomatic policy should proceed along a path of justice. He also said that diplomacy should not be biased and should be conducted with the full strength of the country. Tojo also said that it is still too early to comment on US-Japan relations and Japan's relations with other countries, because "I have not yet seen the necessary arguments."

United Press, Tokyo, 18th: The new Foreign Minister Togo stated today that his health is very good and said that he is determined to devote his abilities to serve Japan. Togo is the most senior professional diplomat. Every time there is a cabinet change, his name is mentioned as a possible Foreign Minister, but this has only been realized now. When meeting with the press, he said, "I am well aware that diplomacy is very difficult at this time, but every Japanese person should sacrifice for the country at this time, and not consider oneself."

United Press, Tokyo, 18th: The Tojo cabinet has been formed. Due to the increasingly tense situation in the Pacific and the increasingly strained relations between the United States and Japan, the new government will face the most serious period in history. The most surprising thing about the new cabinet is that Togo, the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, is the Foreign Minister. The new cabinet is not controlled by military leaders. Many important positions in the new cabinet are filled by so-called mainland experts. This is quite important. The official news agency Domei News Agency stated that the new cabinet has the power to decide whether Japan goes to war or makes peace, so it is considered a powerful government. The new Foreign Minister Togo made important contributions when he concluded a favorable fisheries agreement with the Soviet Union in December 1938. When the Siberian issue was serious, he was considered an expert on Soviet affairs. Togo has also resolved many other Japanese-Soviet issues, such as laying the foundation for the two countries to conclude a commercial agreement and a neutrality pact. He has served in the diplomatic service for twenty-nine years, holding positions in Moscow, Berlin, Washington, China, and Switzerland. Prime Minister concurrently Minister of Interior and Minister of the Army: Hideki Tojo, Minister of Foreign Affairs concurrently Minister of Colonial Affairs: Shigenori Togo, Minister of Finance: Okinori Kaya, Minister of the Navy: Shigetaro Shimada, Minister of Commerce and Industry: Nobusuke Kishi, Minister of Communications concurrently Minister of Railways: Ken Terajima, Minister of Justice: Michiyo Iwamura (incumbent), Minister of Education: Kunihiko Hashida (incumbent), Minister of Agriculture and Forestry: Sakuya Ino (incumbent), Minister of Health and Welfare: Chikahiko Koizumi (incumbent), Minister of State concurrently Director-General of the Planning Board: Teiichi Suzuki (incumbent).

United Press, Tokyo, 18th: The official Japanese news agency Domei News Agency announced today that there will be no change in Japan's basic policies of quickly ending the China Incident and establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Tojo cabinet will focus its efforts on quickly implementing the necessary procedures to achieve this goal. It was also officially announced here that the new Prime Minister, Lieutenant General Tojo, has been specially permitted by the Emperor to remain on active military duty and has been promoted to General.

Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Announces Principles of Diplomatic Policy

Reuters, Tokyo, 18th: Tonight, the new Prime Minister Tojo delivered a broadcast speech to the nation, saying that the basic policy of the new Japanese government is "strong will and rapid action." Tojo did not mention the Axis alliance, but strongly stated that Japan will not change its determination to resolve the China Incident and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. He also said that Japan will implement its basic policies of resolving the China Incident and building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and continue to contribute to world peace. Domestically, we must consolidate the wartime structure, and externally, we must strengthen our ties with the countries we have made agreements with. I deeply value the resolute determination of the whole country, which will surely achieve this goal. I ask for the full cooperation of the country and trust in the government. Although most people currently recognize the Tojo cabinet as a

### Japan Still Hopes to Continue Negotiations with the United States

The United States is Quite Skeptical of Japan's Proposal, Still Awaiting the New Japanese Cabinet to Clarify its Policies

United Press, Washington, 18th: It was learned today that the Japanese government has notified the United States that although there have been political changes in Japan, it still hopes to continue the peace talks initiated by former Prime Minister Konoe. There is considerable skepticism about this Japanese proposal, but the composition of the new Japanese government has led observers to adopt a more optimistic view. Government officials have refused to comment on the new Japanese cabinet led by Tojo, pending clarification of its policies. The United States has not closed the door to continuing peace talks, but it is clear that if the new Japanese government is extremely nationalistic, then the talks have no hope of success. Japan's desire to continue negotiations in the hope of improving relations with the United States was communicated to Secretary of State Hull by Waksugi, a special advisor to the Japanese ambassador to the United States.

### Konoe Falls Ill at His Villa After Resigning; Oikawa Transferred to the Board of Field Marshals and Admirals

Reuters, Tokyo, 18th: Former Prime Minister Konoe is reported to have suddenly fallen ill at his villa, but his condition is not serious, and he is currently resting quietly. At the same time, the Ministry of the Navy has announced that former Navy Minister Admiral Oikawa has been appointed to the Board of Field Marshals and Admirals. The position of Commander of the Yokosuka Naval Station, vacated by the new Navy Minister Shimada, has been succeeded by Vice Admiral Ushida Noboru.

### Villagers Near Changsha Assist the National Army in Combat; Japanese Ammunition and Equipment Were All Destroyed by Fire

Changsha: Ma Fengzui, more than a hundred li northeast of Changsha, was the main battlefield in this decisive battle. A heroic story of cooperation between the army and the people to kill the Japanese occurred there. In the latter half of last month, after the Japanese crossed the Miluo River southward, they used the newly built highway as a transfer station, with more than two hundred infantrymen garrisoned there. Ten days ago, trucks coming from the south loaded with a large amount of ammunition were unloaded and stored there. They also seized grain and sweet potatoes from the area and transported them north. Liang Zhenqiu, a former township head in the area, volunteered to lead the National Army to attack the Japanese. In one evening, he eliminated all the Japanese, set fire to a Japanese ammunition depot and eleven armored vehicles, and seized more than two hundred machine guns and rifles and two field guns. Currently, the fields are littered with exploded shell casings, and four incomplete armored vehicles remain there. On the evening the Japanese were attacked, Zhu Hansong, another local gentleman, fearing Japanese reinforcements and retaliation, especially sent out the laborers who had fled to the mountains to destroy the road on a large scale. Zhu presented each person with two yuan for tea as an encouragement. In one night, they destroyed more than ten li of the highway built by the Japanese at both ends of Ma Fengzui, disrupting the Japanese army's rear communication, which was never repaired. The authorities have ordered an investigation into the loyalty and bravery of Liang and Zhu in saving the country and the township and requested that they be rewarded handsomely. (17th Dispatch)

### Overseas Chinese Remittances to China Centrally Handled by the Central Bank

May Entrust Branches of the Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank to Handle; With This Arrangement, Overseas Chinese Remittances Are Now Smooth

Chongqing: Overseas Chinese remittances were once stagnant due to the British and American freeze on funds. Now that the Chinese government has reached an agreement with Britain and the United States, the Central Bank will handle them centrally. The Central Bank may entrust overseas branches of the Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank to handle these remittances. In locations where there are no branches, the three banks may also, with the consent of the Central Bank, entrust foreign banks that have previously handled remittances from overseas Chinese to handle them. At the same time, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has also been entrusted by the Central Bank to handle remittances from Southeast Asian Chinese. With this arrangement, remittances from overseas Chinese to China are now smooth. In addition, due to the control of foreign exchange by the governments of the Dutch East Indies and Singapore, restrictions have been placed on the amount of money that overseas Chinese can send home for living expenses. The government is currently negotiating to increase the amount from 100 guilders to 300 guilders per person per month in the Dutch East Indies, and to restore the amount from 350 Straits dollars to 500 Straits dollars in Singapore. The former was discussed when the Deputy Director of the Dutch East Indies Foreign Exchange Bureau, Moertell, came to Chongqing and has made some progress. The latter is still under negotiation.

Editorial

### After Tojo's Cabinet Formation

After the fall of the first Konoe Cabinet, Hideki Tojo, with the rank of lieutenant general in the active-duty army, was surprisingly ordered to form a new cabinet. In addition to concurrently holding the portfolios of Home Minister and Interior Minister, he appointed former ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigenori Togo, as Foreign Minister; former commander of the China Fleet, Admiral Shigetaro Shimada, as Navy Minister; and director of the North China Development Company, Kanya Kogane, as Finance Minister. Both the former Prime Minister and Vice Prime Minister, Mr. Konoe and Mr. Numata, have been dismissed. However, Lieutenant General Teiichi Suzuki, Director of the Planning Board and Minister without Portfolio, remains in his position. Judging from the selection of these key cabinet members, the new cabinet is not only a military cabinet of a uniform color, but has at least become a puppet cabinet directly controlled by the military. As Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi said, the military elements who were originally manipulating Japanese politics behind the scenes have now discarded their masks and decided to openly take responsibility, personally engaging in politics.

The universal reaction to Japan's cabinet change is undoubtedly that the military's radical factions, dissatisfied with the past government's policy of watchful waiting, decided to overthrow Konoe in an attempt to seize actual political power and implement their expansionist ambitions through action. Although Hideki Tojo is still considered somewhat cautious and stable among the radical and young factions, and his recommendation by elder statesmen shows that the Japanese moderates (represented by these elder statesmen) still hope to use Tojo as a contingency plan, the general trend suggests that Japan's period of gambling is imminent. Therefore, in exploring the dynamics after Japan's cabinet reshuffle, it seems unnecessary to ask whether it is preparing for action, but only to infer how it will act and where it will act.

Regarding the first question, no matter how Japan touts peaceful southward or northward advances, the fact is that once it decides to act, it must use all of its remaining combat power, which is undoubtedly the case. Japan's army strength has been partially depleted and restrained by China. Whether what remains is sufficient to cope with the needs of a southward or northward advance is questionable, but its navy remains intact, which is undeniable. In the future, if there are new adventurous actions, it is safe to say that the army and navy will advance together.

Regarding the second question, most opinions believe that Japan will inevitably seize the opportunity of the German army's progress in attacking the Soviet Union and stab it in the back. Under the current situation, this is certainly the most likely possibility, especially since Hideki Tojo is known for his anti-Soviet stance and may want to fulfill his long-held ambitions through this cabinet formation. However, before the entire operational strength of the Red Army collapses, especially before the Red Army's Far East forces are massively transferred to the Western Front, it is still a serious question whether the approximately 30 divisions stationed in Northeast China today will be able to achieve anything. Seeing that the new cabinet has appointed the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, to take charge of foreign affairs, it can be seen that before actually invading the Soviet Union, there may still be a slight intention to use Togo to extort Moscow. This "slight intention" sufficiently illustrates, on the one hand, that the Japanese cabinet's opportunistic psychology is still very strong, and on the other hand, it exposes that this "military cabinet" is still somewhat outwardly strong but inwardly weak, attempting to gain advantages without using force.

Saying that the Tojo cabinet is determined to advance north is certainly very possible, but if we say that the Tojo cabinet hopes to take advantage of the Soviet Union's current extremely tight situation on the Western Front and first use extortion and intimidation to extract some benefits from the Moscow authorities, this does not seem unreasonable. Because assuming that the Soviet Union, at a time when it is temporarily under pressure in its war against Germany, is willing to make slight concessions to Japan in the east, at the very least, is willing to reaffirm the neutrality pact with Japan, thereby enabling Japan to return to the northward defense and southward advance situation of the Matsuoka diplomacy era, then it seems that Japan, which benefits from taking advantage of the situation but is absolutely unfavorable to formally participating in the war, has no reason to firmly refuse. Moreover, the danger that Japan is currently considering as dangerous is no longer Vladivostok in the north, but the ABCD encirclement line in the south, and the pain it is suffering from is no longer a military threat from a Soviet Union that has been held back by Germany, but an economic blockade launched by the United Kingdom and the United States and realized in the South Pacific. Under this situation, if the obstacle of northward defense can be removed by taking advantage of the recent development of the German-Soviet war, then Japan, which has been preparing for a southward advance for two years and urgently needs to plunder resources, seems very likely to revive its old dream and venture into the South Seas again.

In summary, although according to the current situation, Japan after the cabinet reshuffle is very likely to first stir up trouble in the north, the ABCD joint front in the South Pacific should not relax in the slightest to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. It is reported that representatives from China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands have held a military conference in Manila to discuss defense issues in the event of war in the Pacific. We hope that the democratic countries will take this opportunity to quickly determine a concrete procedure for joint action, that is, a small-scale East-West cooperation and a combat plan that echoes both north and south.

European War Discussion

### The Harrowing Battle of the Soviet-German War

The Destruction of Soviet Cities / The Muddy Roads of the Soviet Union

The war in Russia has lasted for more than three months and has now evolved into the Battle of Moscow. The tragedy and ferocity of the battles are truly harrowing. The following is an excerpt from the radio telephone report of the New York Times war correspondent:

German soldiers were born in the hardships of the last world war, raised in the years of turmoil and revolution after the war, and trained in the iron discipline of the Nazi Party. Today, they have encountered their match for the first time. Their defensive power, just like the German army's offensive power, is generated by the same force - a revolutionary ideal.

The German-Soviet war is a life-and-death battle between two revolutionary ideals. This is a war of resentment, often with the implication of personal revenge. The conventions of so-called "civilized warfare" do not apply to it. No one can fight to the end of this war without changing in the slightest. The German army, which charges forward and is invincible in other battles, must now fight to the death.

No one can predict who will win this battle in the end, so no one can say what kind of people German soldiers will become when the war ends. Today, they are gradually understanding how to rely on the courage and perseverance of youth to engage in combat, how to fight selflessly and calmly with the enemy, and they are also gradually understanding that sometimes there are strong fortresses defended by armies that vow to never surrender, which cannot be destroyed in one fell swoop even with all efforts.

The ferocity and tragedy of this Russian war are incomprehensible to those who have not personally experienced it. Those who have personally experienced and reported on it can never hide their feelings - long journeys, exhaustion, scorched earth wherever they go, unbearable heat, covered in dust, accumulated filth; when they encounter villages and towns, they think they can get a little respite, but after occupying them, they only find piles of rubble, and they are still disappointed; far behind the front line, or because of guerrilla attacks at night, surprise battles suddenly break out; endless marches, day after day, month after month, although exhausted, every time they occupy a place, the distance to the goal seems to be even further than before; encountering a country like Russia with vast land and sparse population, the long road ahead truly makes people feel helpless.

According to eyewitnesses, the hardship and tragedy of this war are truly rare in the world. German war correspondents also acknowledge the courage and resentment of the Red Army when fighting, and because of this resentment, they still think of killing a few more enemies for several hours before they die; because of this resentment, they still want to engage in hand-to-hand combat in the lowest level of underground fortresses after their ground resistance has been completely defeated by the German army, vowing to never coexist; because of this resentment, every retreat of theirs turns into a desperate counterattack. German interviewers also said that even in the faces of Red Army prisoners, one can see their unrelenting resentment.

Let me cite a recent incident in the Battle of the Stalin Line as proof. The German army prepared to break through the defense line, and then, like they did in France, they surged in and surrounded other fortresses, in order to copy the Red Army's rear routes. Each fortress is modeled after the Maginot Line, with tunnels spanning several miles connecting each other. Only the cement walls and the steel turrets on top are exposed.

German heavy artillery fired fiercely for several hours without stopping. Dive bombers also accurately dropped bombs to complete their mission. When the time was ripe, they issued an order for stormtroopers and engineers to advance, at which time each fortress seemed to be within reach.

When the German army attacked, they used bomb craters, leaned sideways, and used obstacles as cover, winding their way through the remaining barbed wire. German machine guns and flat-trajectory guns fired bullets at the Red Army turrets like rain, causing them to close their gun ports and dare not look out. The fortresses were silent, like dead tombs.

Under the cover of stormtroopers' light machine guns, the engineers carried explosives and went straight to the cement walls of the main fortresses. Suddenly, the artillery in the gun ports became active again. Machine guns and artillery fired from the turrets, sweeping the German army, as if in a sudden storm and heavy rain. The German army, because their own soldiers were in front, dared not open fire. Hand grenades also exploded like showers in the scattered German army. Fortresses on both sides fired guns at the enemy. The German army's advance was blocked, and the engineers retreated to their original positions.

Then, the German artillery re-launched an attack on each fortress. Anti-aircraft guns also changed this angle and carried out flat-trajectory firing, rolling waves of fire onto the scarred enemy forts. At this time, the Red Army turrets closed again, and the German army, under the cover of a rain of bullets, attacked again.

At this time, they actually achieved their goal, burying explosives in two places under the wall, and immediately retreated. In an instant, there was a deafening roar, the explosives exploded, and dust billowed, blasting the ground fortress into powder, leaving only a broken and incomplete gap.

The assault team immediately advanced to complete its occupation work. Anti-aircraft guns fired as many shells as possible, expanding the gap. At that time, it was thought that there was no living thing in the fortress. But as the German army approached, machine gun bullets fired out of the gap again, and the attacking army had to retreat again.

Then, German anti-aircraft gun fire poured into the fortress like a raging tide, and the cement and steel architecture collapsed one after another. The turrets were riddled with holes like honeycombs. Every shell explosion could be clearly seen in the fort. (To be continued)

### Red Army Launches Lightning Counterattack, Orel Recaptured

Soviet Union Admits Abandoning Odessa Port / Fierce Fighting Continues Around Kalinin

United Press, London, 18th. According to Moscow Radio today, Orel, located 215 miles southwest of Moscow, midway on the Moscow-Kharkov railway, has been recaptured by the Soviet army. At the same time, the Exchange Telegraph Moscow correspondent has confirmed this news, and said that the Soviet army, after three days of fierce fighting, has also recaptured an important railway station on the Leningrad front. The Exchange Telegraph also described the Soviet Union's wireless telegram as saying that the German army lost 2,000 officers and soldiers, 150 tanks, 100 artillery pieces, and 200 troop carriers in the Battle of Orel. Our army also had air force assistance when fighting the German army. After this battle, the German army's momentum of advance has been greatly frustrated.

Reuters, London, 18th. Although Moscow newspapers and radio stations continue to emphasize the danger to the Soviet capital, news from the front suggests that the German offensive has now been contained by the Soviet defenders. According to Soviet field correspondents, Orel, south of Moscow, was recaptured by the Soviet army on Thursday after launching a lightning-style counterattack from two directions. This claim has not yet been confirmed by Moscow, but the Soviet army's fierce counterattack against the city is a well-known fact. Currently, the main battles to defend Moscow are still raging around Kalinin, northwest of the city, and along the Vyazma highway. The German claim that its vanguard has reached Leishan, 120 miles southeast of Moscow, has not been confirmed, but it is heard that traffic between Moscow and the eastern route is indeed in serious danger.

Reuters, London, 18th. The Soviet midnight bulletin stated that the Odessa Soviet garrison, outnumbered, has now withdrawn from the port on time after holding it for many weeks, in an orderly manner, and transferred to another part of the front. Yesterday, the entire front continued to fight, especially fiercely on the west side. The Red Army on that side has repelled several enemy attacks. Yesterday, 28 German planes were shot down, and the Soviets lost 17 planes.

Fierce Fighting for Two Weeks, Heavy Casualties / German Difficulties Increasing Daily

Reuters, London, 18th. A "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in the Swedish capital reports that after the largest offensive in history, lasting seventeen days, the German army's footprints have still not reached within 50 miles of Moscow. Although the German army's gains on land cannot be said to be small, the price it has paid is also considerable, and the difficulties thereafter will increase daily. According to well-informed sources from Germany, the German army's casualties in the Battle of Moscow, which began this month, are around 500,000.

Reuters, London, 18th. A Reuters military commentator said that there were no major changes in the Eastern Front situation in the past 24 hours. The Soviet side mentioned the Soviet army's counterattack in the Kalinin area, but the German communiqué only briefly described the situation in the central area, and exaggerated the Romanian army's victory in Odessa and the cooperative combat assistance of the troops north of the Sea of Azov. In this critical stage of the battles around Moscow, every hour that the German army's advance is slowed down is of value to the Soviet side, as it can take the opportunity to transfer reinforcements and make the defenses of these areas more stringent, and also add defensive works such as tank traps, obstacles, and trenches. Reports from all sides confirm that the Soviet side shows no signs of panic or gradual loss of confidence, but has an increasingly firm determination to fight to the end. Weather factors must also be taken into account. The nights on the front have already frozen, and the first snow has been seen. Soon there may be blizzards and heavy snow, which will cut off the German army's long communication lines and invalidate its combat plans. So far, Hitler's use of troops against the Soviet Union has not encountered bad weather, the same as when Napoleon attacked Russia. However, when Napoleon's army approached the city of Moscow, the situation began to change. The evacuation of some parts of the Soviet government and the diplomatic corps from Moscow is a necessary precaution, and it is by no means a lack of faith on the Soviet side to defend Moscow, but it can show the Soviet government's firm determination to continue fighting no matter what happens to Moscow. Stalin has far-sightedness and has established a large arsenal east of the Ural Mountains to prevent emergencies. The loss of the industrial areas of Leningrad, Moscow, and the Don River basin will greatly reduce Soviet production, but it will still be able to continue fighting. Moreover, with the continuous supply of British and American aid, there is no need to worry about a lack of supplies.

### Axis Powers Conspire / American Attention Focused on Two Fronts

America Determined Not to Fear Any Threat of Armed Action / Attack on "Kearny" Arouses National Indignation

United Press, Washington, 18th. While the American Atlantic Naval Patrol, following the order to "shoot on sight," is searching the waters off Iceland for the submarine that torpedoed the destroyer "Kearny" yesterday, the Pacific is also hearing of rapidly changing situations. The U.S. State Department and Congress are thus forced to focus their attention on both fronts at the same time. When the news of the attack on "Kearny" was announced, calls for retaliation immediately filled Congress. At the same time, the House of Representatives passed the Merchant Ship Arming Bill. The tense situation in the U.S. Congress during the early days of the Great War is once again seen today. It is believed that the American order for American ships in the Pacific to sail to friendly ports is proof that the government is increasingly concerned about the issue of U.S.-Japan relations due to Lieutenant General Tojo's leadership of the new Japanese cabinet. It is rumored that the purpose of this order is to warn Tojo that the United States will not fear any threat of armed or political action. Many observers believe that the Pacific crisis and the attack on "Kearny" are both acts of aggression by the Axis powers against the United States, attempting to use armed and political "pincers" to attack the United States.

Reuters, Washington, 18th. Just three minutes after President Roosevelt arrived at his Hyde Park residence in New York yesterday, he spoke by telephone with Washington Naval Secretary Knox and learned of the torpedoing of the American destroyer "Kearny." When the President received reporters in New York, he claimed that the "Kearny" was torpedoed yesterday morning while patrolling 350 miles southwest of Iceland, and that the incident occurred within the U.S. defense zone. As for the details of the matter, the President did not want to discuss it. The President expressed calmness about the ship being hit. When reporters asked if he would issue the same "shoot on sight" order as in the "Greer" incident, the President replied that the usual naval orders already applied. Reporters asked all sorts of questions, but the President did not answer any of them. He did not denounce this as another act of piracy. According to official estimates, the "Kearny" had between 125 and 150 officers and sailors on board. The Navy Department announced that the ship was damaged but was able to proceed on its own. The telegram did not mention casualties. Secretary of State Hull commented on the matter in just a few words, saying that his previous remarks about German submarine activity also applied to this matter. Hull had previously denounced such attacks as acts of piracy. During the debate in the House of Representatives yesterday on the Merchant Ship Arming Bill, many congressmen said that the attack on the "Kearny" showed that the United States was now facing the most despicable and vicious acts of piracy, making the Merchant Ship Arming Bill a very minor matter. Speaker Rayburn said that attacking an American ship was tantamount to directly attacking the United States. Congressman McCormack said that the "Kearny" incident may be related to the situation in the Far East, and that this seemed to be part of a conspiracy between Berlin and Japan. Senator Brewster said that Hitler now seemed to be forcing the creation of a Japanese situation. Senator Pepper argued that if one American ship was attacked, the U.S. Navy should sink one enemy ship in retaliation. Isolationists said that in view of the government's policies, it was not surprising that American ships were attacked.

### Placed Under Naval Control: American Ships Concentrated and Standing By, Ready to Be Dispatched for Far Eastern Shipping at Any Time

Reuters, New York, 18th: A business daily with good relations with the shipping industry reports that a responsible source stated that the Maritime Commission has quietly notified some shipping company personnel in New York that the Army may issue an emergency notice at any time, dispatching all ships for use to the Philippines. The report also stated that the Maritime Commission is currently investigating the situation of merchant ships, and it is rumored that the government has decided that when necessary, it can assemble a fleet of merchant ships for immediate departure to Vladivostok.

United Press, San Francisco, 18th: The Customs Bureau announced last night that no ships may leave the port without permission from the U.S. Navy. This order places the ships in San Francisco under naval supervision. This order was issued by the Department of the Treasury and will remain in effect until further notice.

Reuters, Washington, 18th: It is rumored among the influential that all American merchant ships have been ordered to leave the seas of Japan and China because the Navy Department believes this is necessary due to the situation in the Pacific. However, American ships elsewhere in the Pacific are not affected. The official stance of the Navy Department is that "the Navy Department, in view of the current situation in the Pacific, makes no comment." However, according to reliable sources, the Navy Department has indeed issued an order for American ships to leave the seas of Japan and China. It is said that there are very few American merchant ships in the seas of China and Japan, but there are many in other parts of the Pacific.

Reuters, Washington, 18th: The Navy Department announced that very few American merchant ships have been ordered to return to port to receive orders regarding their voyages. It is entirely wrong to assume that American ships will not continue their usual trade. The control and management of the actions of American merchant ships when necessary has been in place for some time. Instructions regarding this matter are often expanded or revised, so this procedure is neither unusual nor novel.

United Press, Manila, 18th: The U.S. Navy Department has ordered an American cargo ship to return to Manila. The ship received the order this morning and is sailing here. This indicates that the ship received an order to return and stand by. The Navy Department has not announced the name of the ship or its destination.

United Press, San Francisco, 18th: The U.S. Navy Department yesterday ordered American merchant ships in Asian waters to immediately sail into the harbors of "friendly nations." Shipping industry figures believe that this decision indicates that the Pacific situation has reached its peak due to the change of the Japanese cabinet and the failure of U.S.-Japan negotiations. It is also reported that the American cargo ship "President Grant" has returned to Shanghai. The Navy Department's order applies to all American ships requisitioned for use, other American ships of the American President Lines sailing in the Pacific, thirteen ships of the "Matson Navigation Company," and ships mainly requisitioned by the company. The general manager of the American President Lines, Mr. Grady, convened an emergency meeting of company leaders. Personnel from the American President Lines stated that the Philippines, England, and the Netherlands East Indies can all be considered friendly nations. This decision is expected to affect American ships currently transporting oil and war supplies to the Soviet Union and from Malaya to China. It is estimated that according to the Navy Department's order, the majority of several hundred American mail ships and cargo ships will be docked in the harbors of friendly nations in the East. Shipping industry figures say that this order is closer to America "entering the war."

### Japanese Ships Ordered to Return: News Unconfirmed

Reuters, Tokyo, 10th: A Japanese government spokesman stated today that the claim that the American ship "Tatsuta Maru" had been ordered to return to Japan had not been confirmed by him. He could not affirm this claim, but today is a holiday, and there is no way to obtain accurate information. The spokesman made no comment on the meetings of the U.S. President and senior U.S. military and naval officials, saying that the United States is not only concerned about the development of the situation in Japan, but U.S. leaders are free to discuss any event at any time.

### British and American Missions Travel to the Soviet Union by Sea

Landing in Northern Soviet Union: Harriman Returns to the U.S. from England

Reuters, London, 18th: According to footage taken of the British and American missions recently traveling to Moscow to attend a meeting, Beaverbrook and Harriman landed in Arkhangelsk in northern Soviet Union aboard a British cruiser and flew to Moscow.

Reuters, New York, 18th: Harriman has arrived in Washington from London aboard a bomber. It is reported that several army officers also came with him.

### U.S. House of Representatives Approves Arming Merchant Ships

Congressmen Demand Clear Warning to Japan: Reckless Advance Will Destroy Its Navy

Reuters, Washington, 18th: The U.S. House of Representatives yesterday passed the bill to arm merchant ships by a vote of 259 to 138. This bill was passed after news of the torpedoing of the U.S. destroyer "Kearny" arrived. A motion was made to return the bill to the Foreign Affairs Committee for further review, but this motion was defeated by a vote of 257 to 136. The gallery was very crowded during the vote, and more Congressmen than usual attended, spoke, and voted. Democratic Congressman Faddeus spoke before the vote, arguing that the United States should notify Japan that if Japan advances north or south, the United States will destroy its navy.

### U.S. Expedites Shipbuilding Program

Reuters, Washington, 18th: The keel of the new aircraft carrier "Hornet" was laid on October 25, 1939. It has now been completed six months ahead of schedule and will formally join the U.S. Navy on October 20. The ship is one of the largest and most powerful aircraft carriers in the U.S. fleet, equipped with light guns and capable of fighting surface ships and aircraft, with a speed of 30 knots per hour. The U.S. Navy now has a total of seven aircraft carriers, adding luster to the two-ocean navy.

Reuters, Washington, 18th: According to the Navy Department, the United States had a total of 113 submarines as of October 1, with another 73 under construction.

### One Japanese Plane: Trial Flight

From Mandated Island to Dili

Reuters, Tokyo, 18th: According to the recently concluded Japan-Portugal agreement, a Japanese airline plane departed this morning from Palau Island, mandated by Japan, for Dili, the capital of Portuguese Timor, for a trial flight.

### Australia Decides to Transport Trains to Iran by Rail, for Soviet Transport Use

Reuters, London, 18th: Australia has decided to transport trains worth millions of pounds to Iran. This is one of the most important contributions of the British Empire in material terms to the war effort, enabling supplies to be expedited to the Soviet Union via Iran.

### Foreign Diplomatic Personnel Move to Kazan

Havas, Chongqing, 17th: This official received reports that the situation in Moscow is tense. Embassies of various countries received notification from the Soviet government to be transported by train to a designated city on the 15th, but the name of the place was not specified. The Chinese Embassy moved on that day. According to reports, Madam Chuan Xuewen, wife of Shao Lizi, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, had already led embassy staff, women, and children back to the country in early July. As for the relocation site, well-informed sources have long known it to be Kazan (now renamed Qida Lin City).

Reuters, Washington, 18th: The State Department stated last night that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt, along with other members of the Moscow diplomatic corps and senior officials of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, have left Moscow for a location in the East. Personnel from the U.S. supply mission have also left the Soviet capital.

Reuters, London, 18th: It is reported that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps has led the British military and diplomatic mission to leave Moscow and head to the newly established headquarters. Important British files were transported from Moscow to Kazan weeks ago for safety. A large part of the Soviet Foreign Ministry or other departments is currently preparing or has already moved out of the Soviet capital.

### Nobel Prizes: Suspended This Year

Havas, Stockholm, 17th: According to official announcements, the Nobel Prizes have been suspended this year.

### Regulations for Ministry of Education to Subsidize Provinces for Radios and Dry Batteries: Prioritize Purchasing Domestic Products

(Chongqing Airmail News) In order to focus on broadcast education, the Ministry of Education has specially formulated measures to subsidize provinces for radios and dry batteries, instructing the provincial departments of education to comply. The measures are as follows:

(1) Given the current inconvenience of transportation, the Ministry will subsidize provinces for radios and dry batteries. Except for Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces, which will receive radios, the remaining provinces will receive cash subsidies based on the price, which will be directly purchased and distributed by the provincial departments of education. Transportation costs will also be verified and reimbursed by the Ministry.

(2) The Ministry's subsidy for dry battery costs is limited to one set per radio issued by the Ministry. Educational institutions that have independently installed radios may also apply to the Ministry of Education for subsidies if they are truly unable to afford the consumption of dry batteries due to special circumstances.

(3) When applying for radio and dry battery subsidies, provincial departments of education should comply with the quantity stipulated by the Ministry and submit it in one consolidated report.

(4) Provincial departments of education should comprehensively plan in advance when applying for radio and dry battery subsidies and submit separate lists to the Ministry, which will promptly review and respond. (The radio list should separately list the name of the institution, the location of the installation, the type of machine, the machine price, the installation description, and tax-related expenses, etc. The dry battery list should separately list the name of the institution, the location, the type and quantity of dry batteries, the price, the transportation, and tax-related expenses, etc.)

(5) After receiving the Ministry's approval notice, the provincial departments of education should immediately order goods from manufacturers and distribute them. They should obtain payment receipts and transportation expense receipts and submit them to the Ministry along with the department's official letterhead for verification and disbursement of funds.

(6) Areas closer to the central direct radio stations or local provincial radio stations should be allocated radios with fewer vacuum tubes (two or three tubes are sufficient) to conserve provincial resources. DC radios will not be issued to cities and towns with AC power sources.

(7) When purchasing and distributing radios and dry batteries, prioritize purchasing domestic products as much as possible.

### Charity Basketball Game for Student Aid: Blue and White Energetically Defeat Paramount

Cheng Yanqiu and Others Tip-Off: Performers Triumph Over Movie Stars, Nanyang's Main Players Absent, Crushing Defeat to South China

The charity basketball tournament for student aid, hosted by the Paramount Sports Association, featured the first match between Blue and White and Paramount yesterday afternoon at the Paramount court. Before the game, there were also two interludes: South China vs. Nanyang, and Performers vs. Movie Stars. Famous performers such as Cheng Yanqiu were invited to tip-off, so although ticket prices were high, fans of "basketball," "drama," and "movies" still came to watch, filling the seats. South China and Nanyang took the stage first. Nanyang suffered a great loss in strength due to the absence of main players Han Longhai, Long Quan, Ni Zhong, and Zhang Banglun. They trailed 7 to 14 in the first half. In the second half, South China continued their efforts, resulting in a 22 to 13 victory for South China over Nanyang. Then, the Performers team, consisting of members of the lucky rich, played against the Movie Stars. Famous performers Cheng Yanqiu, Tan Xiaopei, Zhang Junqiu, and others, accompanied by Performers team leader Zhang Boming and secretary Chen Ruisheng, arrived at the venue and posed for photos.

Cheng Yanqiu Tips-Off

Movie Star Li Qiu scored first, and Performer Xiao Mengchang retaliated. Movie Stars Shu Shi, Liu Qiong, and Mei Xi launched consecutive attacks. Performers Sun Junqing, Chuan Rushan, Lu Dazhen, and others responded calmly. The score was very close. Movie Stars led 14 to 9 in the first half. After switching sides, Dazhen Zhaoxiong and Hong Gui scored points for the Performers team. The Movie Stars also refused to be outdone, and the battle became more intense. The Movie Stars were leading until the last few minutes when the Performers suddenly surpassed them. In the end, the Performers won 27 to 24, reversing the defeat. The main event was the showdown between Blue and White and Paramount.

The Atmosphere Suddenly Became Tense

Paramount’s Xi Lin opened the scoring with a free throw. Blue and White's Zude Songyuan made one of one free throw, making it three to one. Shaoqing tied the score. Xi Lin took the lead with five to three. Shaoqing Xianglong and Zhong Enhe continued to score, adding thirteen points. In the midst of the chaos, Blue and White only managed to pull back two points by Nan Qun. At the end of the first half, Blue and White trailed 18 to 10. When the second half began, Blue and White tried to recover. Jin Xuan and Dai Qingxian scored eleven points for Blue and White, taking the lead with 21 to 18. Xianglong scored a goal, but still could not stop Blue and White's momentum. Blue and White played steadily, with the largest difference in score reaching eleven points. Subsequently, Xianglong, Xi Lin, and Youliang were all penalized for four fouls and were sent off the court. Paramount’s momentum gradually waned. Blue and White won the first victory with a score of 50 to 42.

### Rui Tang and Yi Zhong Obtain Final Spots

Black Cup Charity Small-Sided Soccer: Huamei Mighty Lions Eliminated Yesterday

The Black Cup Charity Small-Sided Soccer Invitational Tournament kicked off yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM at the Poor Children's Education Center. The opening match was an exhibition game between the Chinese Police and the Liangxing team, with the Chinese Police defeating Liangxing 1-0. In the semi-finals of the invitational tournament, Yi Zhong defeated the Mighty Lions 3-1, while Rui Tang defeated Huamei 7-1.

In Yi Zhong vs. Mighty Lions, Yan Bolin performed the opening kick-off ceremony. Yi Zhong's talents are evenly distributed, and cooperation is tacit. The Mighty Lions are not weak either, but their coordination is more scattered, leading to their defeat. A Mighty Lions defender committed a foul and was penalized with a nine-yard penalty kick, which was scored by Wang Dingqiu, giving Yi Zhong a 1-0 lead in the first half. After switching sides, Yi Zhong's Chen Yinlong scored a goal, making it 2-0. Xiao Ziwen scored back a goal for the Mighty Lions, but Feng Degui then scored again for Yi Zhong, resulting in a 3-1 victory for Yi Zhong, eliminating the Mighty Lions.

In Rui Tang vs. Huamei, Rui Tang has many strong players such as Cai Shengmiao, Cao Qinfang, Lin Dianhua, Xuan Shenghua, and Gu Zhaopeng. Gu Biao is the goalkeeper. Huamei's strength was originally not weak, but because their main player Han Longhai was unable to attend due to a leg injury, resulting in the team being without a leader, the game became one-sided. In the first half, Rui Tang's Cai Shengmiao scored two consecutive goals, and Cao Qinfang added one, giving them a 3-0 lead. When the second half began, Rui Tang's momentum remained strong. Cai Shengsen scored three more goals, and Cao Qinfang scored another goal. Huamei broke the duck egg with a goal by Cao Wenhu. The final score was 7-1, a big victory for Rui Tang over Huamei.

After the match, the organizers announced on the spot that the ticket revenue was 1,309 yuan. There were also honorary coupons being sold. After the collection is completed, another announcement will be made. The audit will be conducted jointly by accountants Li Wenjie and Chen Xianmo.

### "Double Horse" Factory Orders are Over a Hundred Yuan Higher than Foreign Warehouse Goods

The yarn market began tired, then soared, and the situation is hovering. This is because spot sales have stagnated as usual, and the spot prices of "Double Horse" in foreign warehouses are quite cheap, ranging from 1,965 yuan to 7 yuan, more than 100 yuan lower than factory orders. This shows that there is a lack of inventory of yarns for actual sales and that there are more old goods, so the price is divided by new and old, causing the bulls to temporarily abandon their thinking. The opening price in the morning was 2,065 yuan. At this time, more sellers appeared on the table, and soon it fell to 045 yuan. However, the exchange opened weakly, the second board was flat, and the morale turned high, and it returned to 077 yuan. However, the spot market was flat and lacked momentum, and it relaxed to 048 yuan. In the third board, the exchange price turned up, and the buying wind recovered. At the same time, floating and patching, the market gradually rose to 2,110 yuan. However, profit-takers spat it out, and it returned to 2,091 yuan at the close. The highest price in the morning was 2,110 yuan, and the low price was 45 yuan, with a transaction of one high and five thousand packages, all of which were bouncing transactions. In the afternoon, because there is usually no market at the end of the week, the off-site price was 2,088 yuan to 92 yuan. The current yarn market, after a wild surge, may have a period of spinning, which is also unknown.

The half-day market of gold-changed horse futures rose and rebounded. Although the opening in the morning showed that U.S. cotton had risen by 37 to 41 points per pound, it failed to arouse the uneasy hearts of the general public. The market was swaying, and the factory orders opened lower first. Although it once returned upward, it could not withstand the continuous outflow of multiple parties, and it was lowered to 1,048 yuan. The opening price of yarn futures for the near-term was 1,840 yuan, and it fell to 1,829 yuan based on the spot yarn. The November period was 1,870 yuan, and it also fell to 1,848 yuan. The low price for the distant December period was 1,900 yuan. Immediately, rumors spread that the situation was turning harmonious, and the exchange also rebounded. Factory orders followed suit, and buying of yarn futures became prosperous for a while. Both factory orders and yarn futures rose sharply. According to general observation, this year's domestic cotton crop is not good. If the situation tightens, the incoming foreign cotton will decrease. Although sales to customers may also be stagnant as a result, the output will naturally decrease, or it may be good. In the end, the situation is completely dependent on the human heart and must be determined by actual sales. If there is tension internationally, if there is another way out, it will rise even more fiercely. In case of stagnation, it is necessary to adapt to the environment. Fundamentally, the special focus is on the supply and sale. The result of the up and down all day is that the October and November periods have risen by 5 to 15 yuan. Because December fell too much, it is still short 4 yuan. A list is attached below.

### Large Quantity of U.S. Cotton to Arrive Tomorrow

A large shipment of U.S. cotton will arrive in port tomorrow. It is being transported by the Argentine ship SS Norte, managed by the Foreign Department of Jardine Matheson & Co., from Maceió, Brazil. It totals 30,810 bales. Upon arrival in Shanghai, it will berth at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.

The current cotton situation is slightly ordinary. This is because the extent of domestic promotion has been large, and another batch of sources has arrived. Factories, apart from sporadic purchases for piecemeal use, have no batch transactions. Transactions between counterparts are also more sluggish.

The New York cotton market rose due to buying by industry peers and short covering. Yesterday's closing price was 35 to 6 pounds higher than the previous day's.

The Indian cotton market rose due to short covering and speculative buying. The result was that the closing prices rose by 2 to 3 rupees each. It is also predicted that the opening price today will fall by 2.25 rupees.

The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai is flat, and there are only slight embellishments for spot ear transactions between counterparts, and the selling price is also slightly tired, falling by about 3 to 4 yuan.

### Gradual Apprehension About Stockpiling Cloth

Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was scattered because customer sales were blocked, counterparts were waiting and watching, and speculators were also apprehensive due to the dangerous international situation, so transactions became increasingly light. The selling prices changed very little. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill fell by 2.5 to 5 cents. Part of the bleached and dyed cloth fell by 5 cents. The total number of transactions in this street was more than 200 pieces. Sales to customers are still stagnant.

Eastern Cloth: The market opened particularly tired in the morning. All cloths fell in unison. Later, the futures on the exchange rebounded, and the prices of each month rose by 10 cents to 30 cents at the close. People's hearts stabilized, and the spot price also gradually increased. Therefore, the closing price of the new factory order for Longtou fine cloth at noon was 7.17 yuan and 35 cents, also up 25 cents. The transaction of Sijunzi Serge was not strong, and the market situation was still soft. The new single price was around 2.42 yuan, a decrease of 1.5 cents.

### Monday Opening: Cash Futures Trading

Yesterday, the gold market experienced volatile trading in the black market. Cash futures trading will commence next Monday for one week. Although the October futures will continue as usual, the bullish side of Deutsche Bank has begun to cover their short positions, leading to a temporary strengthening of the market. The price rose from 8,250 yuan to 8,360 yuan, eventually settling 30 yuan higher.  About 660 taels were traded in the morning session. The upward momentum in cash gold remained strong, with two banks competing to buy, driving the price from 11,000 yuan to 11,370 yuan.  Sales of 100 taels by the Hong Kong group suppressed the price by 100 yuan, eventually settling 290 yuan higher, with 1,300 taels traded. In the afternoon, with no market on Saturday, gold ornaments settled 20 yuan higher, at 1,150 yuan.

The October futures opened at 8,250 yuan at 9:30 AM. Xiangxing, Yongde, Fudong, Tongkang, Yongyuxing, and Yongdingsheng successively pushed the price up 110 yuan to 8,360 yuan.  At noon, Chen Da and Tian Yuan sold, causing the price to decline. The market closed at 8,280 yuan, settling 30 yuan higher, with a fluctuation of 110 yuan.

The cash spot price opened 20 yuan higher. Zhongxing released 30 taels to Xianghe, and Da and Defu each released 10 taels, at 11,000 yuan.  Soon after, Cheng Da, Tian Yuan, Mingfeng, Yongfengyu, and Decheng Yiyuan actively bought, while Zhong Yu, Cheng Ji, Yongchengxiang, and Yong sold at around 11,050 yuan. Seeing certain banks and cash dealers competing to buy, the price rose even further, surging between 11,100 and 11,300 yuan. Hesheng purchased 10 taels from Wanfeng, pushing the price to 11,370 yuan. At noon, Shihe forcefully sold 100 taels, causing a drop of 100 yuan. The market closed bullish at 11,270 yuan, a sharp increase of 290 yuan compared to the previous day, with a daily fluctuation of 370 yuan.  The listed price of gold at gold shops was 11,400 yuan, with a purchase price 400 yuan lower than the selling price.

The selling price of gold ornaments at silver shops: Datongxing and Xintongxing initially listed the price as 1,160 yuan until 11:30 AM, before dropping it by 10 yuan to 1,150 yuan, settling 20 yuan higher. The purchase price was reduced by 10 yuan.

### Black Market Exchange Rates See Some Demand

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw both the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications listing their exchange rates at the same level. HSBC's small counter price was stable. In the black market for US and British currencies, at the opening in the morning, there were quite a few merchants eager to buy US dollars at 3.875 yuan.  Exporters supplied small amounts at 3.75 yuan, after which the market quieted down.  At noon, the exchange rate for US dollars closed at 8.75 yuan, difficult to buy or sell.  The exchange rate for British pounds was 11, with limited supply, resulting in rates at the same close as the previous day.  There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw both British and American gold pounds increase by 5 yuan. The supply of British gold notes suddenly increased, causing the market price to fall by 4 yuan. The price of American gold notes reached 28.15 yuan, a decrease of 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day.  The supply and demand for Hong Kong notes were balanced, and the market price remained stable.  Japanese gold notes generally trended downward, falling to 2.53 yuan in the evening market.  The price of Korean notes slightly tightened and increased, reaching 2.11 yuan in the evening market.

### Grain Weevils Are Stirring; Timely Action Should Be Taken

The long-awaited Pacific storm, desired by grain weevil hoarders, has a high possibility of materializing, causing speculators to make big moves.  When the market opened this morning, large-scale hoarders scattered and small players rushed to buy. They were shouting and raising prices, pushing and pulling.  Small fluctuations were seen in the Silver and Foreign Trade Guild, initially jumping to 134-135 yuan, and rising continuously with new prices seen constantly.  Although actual sales still relied on the Public Works Department's subsidized rice and public warehouses, the grain weevils did not pay attention to this and continued their upward trend.  By closing time, the Silver and Foreign Trade Guild had already reached 137-138 yuan, and the shouting price was even at 140 yuan, but those holding goods refused to release them.  With sufficient rice in the market, but the rice market behaving in this way, the Public Works Department should take further action to prevent a major threat to the people's food supply.  This sharp rise is entirely driven by speculation. No. 1 Saigon even reached the 150 yuan mark. No. 1 reached 145 yuan, followed by 142 yuan and 140 yuan.  Java premium rice reached 146 yuan, and broken premium rice jumped from 112.5 yuan to 110 yuan. The price increased a huge five or six yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, which was truly unexpected.

The asking prices for thick and thin new broken japonica rice also increased, with prices rising by one or two yuan. Early Nan'gang broken rice opened at 158.5 yuan.  Kunshan new japonica rice at 156.5 yuan, Qingjiao tea type at 156 yuan, and Xitang at 155.5 yuan. Glutinous rice considered itself a rare commodity and appeared to be selling well. Hong Kong white rice was priced as high as 165 yuan, later actually opening at 163 yuan. Even in the central region, it had to be 158 yuan, an increase of a huge four or five yuan compared to the previous market.

### Fiercer Flour Manipulation

Yesterday, rumors of American freighters being suspended caused further panic, leading to a step-by-step increase in flour prices. The early market for Cannonball flour opened at 40.3 yuan, reached 43.8 yuan in the afternoon, and closed at 43.7 yuan.  The early market for Golden Dragon flour at the West Bund opened at 41 yuan, reached 42.8 yuan in the afternoon, and closed at 42.5 yuan. The early market at the East Bund opened at 41.2 yuan, reached 42.7-42.8 yuan in the afternoon, and closed at 42.6-42.7 yuan. Prices increased by more than two yuan across the board, with 80,000 to 90,000 bags traded, of which 70-80% were absorbed by hoarders. Bran was also priced 2 yuan higher, but no transactions were made.  The asking price for wheat even increased by three to five yuan, but there were also buyers accepting the price.

### Oil Brokers Are Even More Rampant; Selling Prices Increase by Seven Yuan

Yesterday, the price of cooking oil rose sharply.  With the price of rice flour being driven upward, the oil brokers were unwilling to be left behind. Under the thriving speculative buying atmosphere, the price increased by another six or seven yuan.  The total market offered 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 400 cans of Jiangbei soybean oil, 700 cans of raw oil, 600 dan of Dayou Factory refined oil, 500 dan of vegetable oil, 100 barrels of Rihua Factory vegetable oil, and 200 dan each of Yoshida and Taishan Factory vegetable oil and 100 dan of Lide Factory vegetable oil.

1,250 cans of raw oil and 350 bags of raw kernels arrived in Shanghai on the 18th, all shipped from Qingdao.

1,910 bags of soybeans and 130 bags of sesame were exported to Hong Kong on the 19th.

### Public Bonds Significantly Affected

The public bond market was further deteriorating yesterday due to the establishment of a military cabinet in Japan. Public confidence in bonds was already weak, and this news further weakened it. However, the Sichuanese were still selling continuously. Yesterday was Saturday, and only one session was held in the morning. There was a significant gap between supply and demand. Class C bonds broke the 9-yuan mark again, Class B bonds fell back into 1 yuan, and Class E bonds rose to 8 yuan.  Xiexing, Yuanyitai, Hongda, Tongxing, Tongshen, Shengdayichang, and others successively bought in the market, but selling pressure was too strong. Tongkang, Baolong, Houde, Lianhe, Zhongxin, Dazhong, Renchang, Jiufeng, and others were all selling, with Dazhong selling the most. Class C bonds fell below the 9-yuan mark, reaching a low price of 68.6 yuan.  The trend showed no sign of improvement.  Market prices uniformly continued to increase slightly from 0.2 to 0.75 yuan.  The transaction volume was 1.56 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

The stock transaction volume was 1,000 shares of North China Electric Power, with a price of 18.25 yuan per share. Yesterday, 300 shares of World Book Company were traded, with a price of 73 yuan per share.

London, 17th (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listing prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British companies' stocks remain sluggish. Bank stocks are generally trending downward. Chartered Bank shares fell 3 shillings and 9 pence to 9 pounds, 8 shillings, and 9 pence. HSBC UK registered shares fell 3.5 pounds to 78 pounds. Hong Kong registered shares fell 1 pound to 87 pounds, with bids but no offers.

### Another Round of Dividends for Three Foreign Stocks

The Anglo-French Land Company Limited, managed by Jardine Matheson & Co., will distribute an interim dividend of 3 yuan per share (National Currency) on October 28th for the fiscal year ending February 1942.

The British Paper Industry Company Limited will distribute the third interim dividend of 0.35 yuan per share (National Currency) on November 11th for the fiscal year ending April 1942.

The British China Land and Colonization Company Limited, managed by McBain & Co., will distribute the second interim dividend of 2 yuan per share (National Currency) and the second interim bonus dividend of 1 yuan per share (National Currency), for a total of 3 yuan (National Currency) on November 11th for 1941.

### Raw Sugar: Initial Increase, Then Decrease

Yesterday, the sugar market trended downwards after hearing that large quantities might be arriving from Hong Kong. The association made a preliminary offer. The spot price for Grade 24 raw white sugar was initially 218.5 yuan, then fell to 15 yuan, 12 yuan, and eventually as low as 10 yuan, a decrease of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day.  September was 216 yuan, then 14 yuan, 10 yuan, 08.5 yuan, the decrease being the same. August was 215 yuan, then 20 yuan, 10 yuan, 07.2 yuan, 8 yuan, decreased by 2 yuan. July was 214 yuan, then 10 yuan, 06 yuan, 7.5 yuan, decreased by 2.5 yuan.  April was 192 yuan, then 90 yuan, and then 89 yuan. Hong Kong goods were 193 yuan, then 92 yuan, 90 yuan, 89 yuan, with no change. Dutch red sugar was 177 yuan, down 3 yuan. Taikoo Grade B white sugar was 208 yuan, down 2 yuan. HX sugar was 197 yuan, down 3 yuan.

### Hongji White Coal: Solely Controlled; Black Market Soaring; Stores Stopped Selling

The listed price of Hongji white coal is 530 yuan, but there are only listed prices, not actual sales. It is secretly controlled by a certain firm.  Even the small amount sold directly by the coal yard has been stopped, preventing local stores from purchasing it.  On the other hand, people are sent to the market to scoop up whatever they can get and sell in small quantities.  Black market prices are all above 600 yuan.  With cunning plans, they are exhausting their manipulative skills.  It is hoped that a thorough investigation will be conducted to avoid being misled. New shipments are arriving successively. Yesterday, a certain ship arrived from Vietnam carrying 4,250 tons of Hongji lump coal, which has already arrived at the port and is being unloaded by the managing firms Dalongxing and Yitaixing.

Due to the limited arrival of small and large broken white firewood recently, it is considered valuable due to its scarcity. However, because long pine sections of firewood offer profitable opportunities for merchants, there has been a large purchase. Yesterday, another thirteen boats arrived downstream, which were distributed among the same industry firms. Each 100 catties was sold for 10.05 yuan. Compared to the highest price, it has already dropped 2 yuan. If the supply continues to arrive, further price drops are expected.

### French-Style Linings Selling Well

French-style linings have been selling well in the market recently, because the use of thick wool suits, overcoats, riding breeches, tweed coats, and cashmere-lined coats has suddenly become widespread. Large and small Western-style tailors are all eagerly buying them. The stock is scarce, and the only readily available products are Jinqian brand from Hongsheng, 1470 from Yinfeng Xinji, Daye brand from Daye, and 300 brand from Yuanjisheng. And the selling prices are all expensive, due to the high prices of raw materials and increased costs. Moreover, there are no machines for weaving. Currently, Hongsheng French-style linings are 3.5 yuan, Daye are 2.25 yuan, and Yuanjisheng are 1.45 yuan.

### Dyes Have Reached This Price

Due to the ban, English and American dyes cannot be shipped to Shanghai, and the source of German dyes has been cut off due to the obstruction of the Siberian route. In addition, foreign firms have very little stock, and local consumers are eager to buy. As a result, market prices have been rising rapidly, almost overnight. The famous brands of Defu Foreign Firm's goods are selling particularly well. Looking at the world, it is not easy to access supplies by land or sea. The source can be said to be hopeless. Therefore, the remaining stock will naturally decrease day by day. As a result, the goods selling the best have extremely high and firm market prices, roughly as follows (unit: yuan): Macgu Qinglian 8,500; Double Goose Scarlet 3,500; Five-Beauty Qinglian 8,000; Silk Yarn Yuan Qing 5,000; Four-Immortal Boiled Red (price unreadable); Black Electric Powder 2,400; Five-Horse Boiled Red 6,000; Double Goose Yuan (price unreadable) 1,400; Two-Immortal Rose 3,200; Ten-Thousand-Year Boiled Blue 2,000; Samsung Earth Gray 8,000; Double Duke Boiled Blue 2,200.

### Market Situation Summary

Daily necessities prices rise step by step: With factories unable to ship goods for the foreseeable future, hoarders are scouring the market with all their efforts. The current opening prices are: Phoenix brand matches 1,380 yuan per case, America brand 1,400 yuan, Rose brand 1,100 yuan, miscellaneous brands 980 yuan, solid Ben soap 66 yuan per case, Bai Xianmao soap 56.5 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap 51 yuan, Sailing brand candles 38.8 yuan per case, Ying brand 38.3 yuan. The market sentiment is livelier than before.

Arrowroot Flour Recovers Significantly: After the initial increase, arrowroot flour saw some decline, with the best quality being less than 140 yuan, and the origin price also being more favorable. However, due to exchange rate issues, costs have increased again. Upon investigation, the current stock in Shanghai is dwindling, and the varieties are incomplete and insufficient, so the price has also recovered significantly. Yesterday's market price for Flying Kirin was 145 yuan, IA brand 135 yuan, and both Variant T and Variant B brands were 120 yuan. Grade 3 flour was 90 yuan.

Fennel Sees a Strong Price Increase: Previously, fennel sales were sluggish, leading to a decline in prices to less than 300 yuan. Recently, sales have recovered, and costs have also increased, so the price has rebounded. Yesterday's market price was 340 yuan.

### No Recall Order Yet from Washington; US President Liners Still Sailing to Shanghai; Twelve Liners' Schedules Unchanged; Rumors of Traditional Company Moving to Philippines Denied Yesterday; US Navy Purchasing Office in Shanghai Also Not Received Stop-Sail Notices

According to news from the American President Lines, as of noon today, shipping authorities in Shanghai have not received formal orders to recall American ships back to American and British ports. A company representative informed the Chinese Press that it is still too early for the authorities to recall US ships. As scheduled by the President Lines, twelve President Liners will sail to Shanghai before the end of November. Unless there is a formal order to stop sailing to Shanghai, there will be no changes. They also deeply believe, based on the current situation, that these twelve liners will not cease sailing to the Far East. It was also learned that the US Navy Purchasing Office in Shanghai also denies receiving formal notices regarding orders for US ships to leave the coasts of China and Japan. As of yesterday afternoon, no ships have been recalled by Washington.

Philippine Office Can Be Moved Back at Any Time

Regarding the rumor that the American President Lines' Far East headquarters would be moved to Manila, a company representative stated that the company has no such orders. The representative also stated that the company's Vice President Mr. Stevens is still in Manila for inspection. Some of the Shanghai staff have been transferred to Manila due to the company's business expansion in that location. The Shanghai company is not considering permanently transferring Shanghai staff to Manila, as the Manila office can be moved back to Shanghai at any time.

Far East Shipping Lines Not Interrupted

Furthermore, according to information from the US Shipping Department, the company has not received confirmation of the US State Department's order for American ships to leave the Far East coast. Except for the six President Liners - President Cleveland, President Pierce, President Taft, President Jefferson, President Hayes, and President Adams - which have been requisitioned by the US government for transport duties, there are still fourteen ships operating on the President Lines' routes. In addition, there are seven old liners from the World Class, four new ships, and the President Liners Coolidge and President Jackson, and the Alexander, which are still sailing on schedule and have not been interrupted.

Imports and Exports Still Unobstructed

Yesterday, Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai flocked to the President Lines on Guangdong Road to inquire about the news. The company denied the rumor that the US President Liners would cease sailing to the Far East. The reporter also learned that foreign shipping in Shanghai is still flourishing: (1) The Tai-Koo Line's ships Hanyang and Qiongzhou will sail to Hong Kong this morning according to the scheduled route. (2) In this month, the Java Company will have one cargo ship arrive in Shanghai, and at the beginning of next month, there will be a passenger mail ship traveling between the Dutch East Indies, Australia, and Shanghai. (3) The French Maritime Company's Grand Detachement will sail from Shanghai to Manila and Saigon on the 22nd. As of yesterday, the company was still accepting freight orders for Manila. According to the English-language China Press, after the US authorities instructed US merchants and ships operated by US merchants to immediately sail to friendly ports, it has been learned that the Panama liner Preciada is currently sailing to Shanghai. The liner's manager, the American President Lines, admitted that the liner is coming to Shanghai upon instruction but could not specify when it would arrive in port. It is widely believed that the Preciada is currently in the sea near Shanghai and may enter the port tomorrow (the 19th).

### Nanyang Inspection Group Departs from Hong Kong, Organized by Shanghai and Hong Kong Business Communities

Regarding the Nanyang Inspection Group organized by the Shanghai and Hong Kong business communities, after repeated consultations between the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Hong Kong Office, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai Merchants Association, it was decided that the group would depart from Hong Kong. It will first go to Bombay, Delhi, and Calcutta in India, and then to Yangon, Batavia, Surabaya, and Manila, before returning to Hong Kong. It is heard that the required expenses for each group member will be 4,500 Hong Kong dollars. The departure date is at the end of next month. Recently, Chinese national products have been selling very well in the Nanyang and India regions. Therefore, the purpose of this trip is to improve and adjust the products based on the findings of the inspection, which will be of great benefit to the prospects of China's foreign trade.

### Giant Liner Managed by Jardine Matheson Sunk, Named "Prince of Singalese"

Since the outbreak of World War II in Europe, many merchant ships at sea have been lost. Recently, the British ship "Prince of Singalese" (phonetic translation), managed by the foreign department of Jardine Matheson & Co., was sunk by enemy ships in the Atlantic Ocean. The ship had a gross tonnage of 8,473 tons and a net tonnage of 5,257 tons. It arrived in Shanghai on July 8th last year and departed from Shanghai on the 13th to transport goods to the United States. After unloading the goods in New York, it was requisitioned for military use. It was sunk at the beginning of this month.

### Celebration of US Defense Day, Ceremony Undecided

October 27th is US Defense Day (formerly known as Navy Day, recently renamed). It is not yet known what kind of celebration will be held by the US Navy authorities in Shanghai for this great holiday. According to information revealed by the US Navy authorities, they have not yet received orders from Washington. However, according to US official news, the day is also designated as President Franklin D. Roosevelt's birthday. Former US President Theodore Roosevelt issued an order in 1908 for all US fleets in the Pacific to cruise to avoid the difficulties caused by the prohibition of Japanese immigrants entering the United States. At that time, the US Pacific Fleet was not simultaneously berthed in Shanghai, Singapore, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Australia. Navy Day began at that time and was chosen by Theodore Roosevelt to be October 27th, because it was also his birthday. Last year, the US Navy authorities in Shanghai canceled the invitation to the public to visit warships for Navy Day. With the unrest in the current situation, it is feared that there will be no such invitation this year, and only a commemorative ceremony will be held.

### Mailing Parcels to North China Requires Improved Methods

Regarding the mailing of small parcels of goods from Shanghai to various parts of North China, the Shanghai Postal Administration has recently, in response to requests, formulated mailing procedures and has notified the public. However, due to the rather troublesome nature of these procedures, senders feel that they are very inconvenient. Therefore, they have requested the Postal Administration to find ways to improve them to alleviate merchants' difficulties. However, according to a person in charge of the Postal Administration, these procedures will continue to be implemented in the short term, and it seems that there are many difficulties in making changes.

### Controlling the Prices of Daily Necessities, Starting with Flour; The Shanghai Municipal Council Resolved to Request Foreign Exchange Allocation; The Same Action Will Be Taken to Address Coal Prices; The French Concession Authorized a Sub-Committee to Execute

Both the Concession authorities have indicated that they intend to take steps from next week to control the rising food prices in Shanghai. The general public therefore harbors a strong hope that prices will fall across the board. The French Concession Municipal Council has dispatched staff from the bureau and special staff from the French Police Department to form a new group to control prices. Among these, the maximum selling prices have already been set for pork and coal briquettes. As for the Shanghai Municipal Council, it is expected to publish a detailed report on the price situation at the beginning of next week and take price-limiting actions. According to The Times, it is planned to add clauses to the land regulations to strengthen the prevention of hoarding and suppress rising prices. According to an official of the Shanghai Municipal Council, this plan has not yet been formally discussed by the council, but it may be studied.

Purchasing Flour Will Be Implemented Soon

According to reliable sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council held a special meeting yesterday morning and decided to curb the rising price of flour. The method is the same as that used to suppress the price of rice. The Shanghai Municipal Council will request the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund to provide foreign exchange to purchase flour from abroad, which will be sold at prices set by the Shanghai Municipal Council. At that time, speculative merchants hoarding flour will also have to sell their inventory at the specified price. It is also learned that the authorities will take action to address coal prices. As the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund has refused to provide a large amount of foreign exchange within three days, the price of coal has risen. The reporter inquired with the relevant department yesterday on what date the flour management plan would be implemented. According to the department, it will be implemented soon. As it has been resolved, it will be implemented in the shortest possible time. Although the nature of the flour management method is the same as that of rice, there are slight differences in the steps taken.

The French Municipal Council Has a Consistent Policy

The Times reported that Mr. Tam Ngou Ti, Director General of the French Concession Municipal Council, recently told reporters that the Council has established a special group with the authority to immediately implement its decisions without having to wait for approval from the Council. This is the beginning of the Council's suppression campaign against the continuous increase in prices within the Concession. Prices for pork and coal briquettes have already been set, and those selling above the price will be severely punished. The biggest obstacle encountered by the Council in fighting against high prices is the foreign exchange problem. Speculation and hoarding are relatively minor ancillary factors. In the case of coal briquettes, coal importers cannot obtain foreign exchange at the official preferential exchange rate of 18.6 legal currency per US dollar. Therefore, the foreign exchange rate used for recent settlements can only be calculated at the rate of 28 legal currency per US dollar. The reporter asked what steps the French Municipal Council had taken to align with the Shanghai Municipal Council's planned actions to suppress prices. Mr. Tam responded:

Setting Up a Subcommittee to Handle Matters with Full Authority

The Municipal Council will not take any action to address the rising rents in the Concession during the war. This is the same as the situation in the Shanghai Municipal Council. However, for important food and commodities, the Municipal Council has established a special group to control prices, called the Executive Subcommittee of the Price Limit Committee. It has held several meetings, and the methods it has agreed upon can be implemented immediately without formal approval from the Council. Any merchant or store selling goods at prices exceeding those set by this group will be severely punished. To date, the Executive Subcommittee has set the price of pork at an average of 1.8 yuan cheaper per pound than the price outside the Concession. In addition, the committee has determined that the French Concession has sufficient coal briquette inventory, so it has rejected the coal briquette manufacturers' proposal that they should sell at 18.8 yuan per dan, and has set the maximum selling price at 17.2 yuan per dan.

Rental Issues Left for Later Discussion

Mr. Tam further stated that the Municipal Council's procurement of rice has been successful, and the selling price of Saigon broken rice has been maintained at 89 yuan per dan for a long time. There are no special decisions regarding the possibility of the Municipal Council actively supporting the import of other foods. Former Judicial Director of the Municipal Council, Mr. Gogry, made efforts to alleviate the rental issue. Since Mr. Gogry's assassination, the Municipal Council has continued his work, resolving disputes between landlords and tenants through arbitration. However, more extensive methods to deal with this "delicate" issue will be implemented after the price issue is resolved. The Municipal Council is determined to cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Council to work hard to suppress high prices.

### New Clothing Stores Have Resumed Operations

The workers of the new clothing stores on Fujian Road, Xinzha Road, Xiafei Road, and other districts went on a joint strike on the 15th of this month because their request for a wage increase was not granted. All the new clothing stores were temporarily closed. After representatives from both labor and management made repeated consultations, their opinions were quite harmonious. A satisfactory agreement has now been reached and signed: (1) The management shall not dismiss workers without cause; (2) Wages above 25 yuan will be increased by 60%, and those below 25 yuan will be increased by 70%; (3) Commission rates will remain unchanged (1.3% in the Shilu district, 0.8% in other districts); (4) Year-end bonuses should be distributed to workers in proportion to previous years; (5) Apprentice monthly allowance is 4 yuan; (6) Stores that do not provide breakfast should subsidize 8 yuan per month per person for breakfast; (7) Severance pay: one month for service periods of three years or less, and two months for service periods of more than three years; (8) Working hours are 13 hours. These terms have been effective since the 18th of this month. All employees have resumed work since yesterday, and all new clothing stores have also resumed business as usual.

### YWCA Nursery School Inspection Ceremony, a New Type of Social Enterprise Benefits Working Women

The YWCA is a group familiar to workers, but many people may not know about the nursery school for working women that it runs!

For several years, newspapers and magazines have been promoting nursery schools, but there has never been a practical response. It was not until this spring that the YWCA resolutely established a nursery school for working women at 638 Weihaiwei Road. This is a brand new children's welfare undertaking. The ladies of the YWCA are only starting it. The widespread establishment of such schools in the future will depend on the efforts of social service groups. Because the YWCA is the pioneer, the current state of this first nursery school in China is worth recording for those who aspire to continue the work and readers who care about children's welfare as a reference.

From the outside, the association looks like an ordinary Western-style house along the street, but after entering, it is suddenly bright and spacious. In the reception room, there are many photos and records of children's lives hanging, giving visitors a general overview. The association has three floors, with separate children's bedrooms, playrooms, classrooms, washrooms, and bathrooms. The layout is neat and orderly. The washrooms have separate basins and baskets for storing washing supplies, and there is a separate isolation bedroom for children with illnesses, which is most in line with hygiene principles.

The nursery school currently has 30 children, aged from two to four years old. Seven-tenths of their parents are working women, mostly teachers, and the rest are housewives. Only six children stay overnight, because one mother works in a hospital and has to work night shifts. The rest are taken home by their parents when they finish work. The children enter the school at 8:30 in the morning. In the morning, there are classes such as physical examination, cleaning, singing, outdoor games, and storytelling. In the afternoon, they are given two hours of nap time, and then there are still activities such as free activity, outdoor games, picture viewing, and singing. In addition to lunch, there are snacks in the morning and afternoon, and dinner is provided for children who stay overnight. After each meal, fruits and snacks are distributed. Attention is paid to nutrition to ensure that children eat what is beneficial to their health. Children who do not stay overnight leave the school at 5:30 in the afternoon. The school also has a kindergarten, which specializes in accepting children over four years old and providing them with appropriate and reasonable education.

The school has specially made forms for parents and the school to fill out separately regarding the children's living conditions at home and in the school. Details such as the length of naps, bowel movements, diet, health, learning, and behavior must be recorded in detail for reference in children's education. The weight and height of the children when they enter the school, as well as the increase or decrease after they enter the school, are also recorded in a list, and the development of the children's physique is checked at any time. The school pays special attention to the investigation of children's living habits, such as past conditions, when they were weaned, when they started walking, when they started talking, when they started teething, and the difficulties they experienced during this time, as well as their current likes and dislikes in terms of diet, sleep, and games, and analyzes them clearly. The school invites parents to come to the school for a meeting every week to report on the characteristics of the children that should be paid attention to at that time and to discuss child-rearing opinions with each other. Because most working women are intellectuals, they all attend, which is of great help to the progress and effectiveness of the work. All of these are the most advanced children's education methods. The YWCA nursery school is based on the success of nursery schools in Europe and the United States and is determined to implement them.

The director of the school is a graduate of Shanghai University, who studied at the University of Pennsylvania in the United States and specialized in child welfare and child education. She said that nursery school is not only for the sake of children's own happiness, to meet the needs of working women, to instill parents with common sense about child-rearing, and to cultivate childcare talents, but it is also absolutely related to the future of women's careers. The YWCA has limited capacity and is temporarily running this school and the Shanghai Nursery School on Bailinan Road. The latter focuses on working women in factory areas. It is hoped that after the country is revived, nursery schools will be established in major cities across the country. What we are engaged in today is only to be a sentry for the nursery school cause.

### British Tramway Company Rectifies Bad Habits of Ticket Sales; Honesty is Respected, Dishonesty is Despised

Public vehicles such as trams and buses in the two concessions of this city have continuously increased fares since this year, by as many as three times. However, no measures have been taken to stop the bad habits of ticket sellers' fraud and embezzlement. After all sectors of the city unanimously expressed dissatisfaction and sent letters to the companies to urge suggestions, the companies, in order to prevent ticket sales fraud, in addition to dispatching a large number of ticket inspectors to check tickets in sections, also requested passengers to assist in stopping it. Since the implementation began, this bad atmosphere has gradually subsided. Recently, in order to completely eliminate this malpractice, the British Tramway Company posted a large number of moral slogans yesterday, such as "Honesty is Respected" and "Dishonesty is Despised," to serve as a warning.

### Xiaoguang Middle School Searched, Ten Students Detained

### Qin Zhonghuan, Staff Member of Dazhong News Agency, Passed Away Yesterday

On the evening of April 1 this year, the Dazhong News Agency was bombed. Mr. Qin Zhonghuan, a staff member, was hit in the foot by shrapnel and his ankle bone was shattered. After recuperating until now, he suddenly suffered from hemoptysis and passed away at about 3 a.m. yesterday. The colleagues of the agency expressed extreme grief and indignation because Mr. Qin was not directly killed by the bombing, but was in fact caused by it. The body was coffined yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. It is reported that the responsible party, considering that Mr. Qin was alone and his life was pitiful, has given 2,000 yuan for funeral expenses to take care of his funeral affairs.

### Counterfeit Substitute Coupons, Five Criminals Arrested, Nearly 10,000 Fake Coupons Seized

All are now detained in the French Concession Patrol Room. Previously, due to the lack of French currency, the French Municipal Council issued substitute coupons specifically for distributing wages to the council's small workers. The coupons were divided into three types: three yuan two jiao, two yuan five jiao, and two yuan one jiao three. Because of their reliable credit, general tobacco and paper shops in the French Concession accepted and exchanged them on behalf of the council. On the 15th of this month, Xinchang Tobacco and Paper Shop at 324 Rue Massenet, a customer, He Jinrong, a local resident, presented a substitute coupon of two yuan and one jiao issued by the Municipal Council to the shop for exchange. The shop owner, Li Mubin, found that the printing of the coupon was very poor and suspected it was fake. He then twisted the coupon together with the person to the French patrol room. After investigation by detectives, it was found to be counterfeit. They went to Jiazhong, 32 Pingyuanfang, Rue Massenet, He's residence, and seized another 42 counterfeit coupons and arrested He Zida Pei and brought him into the patrol room for interrogation. He confessed to his accomplices and the location of the counterfeit coupon manufacturing facility. The detectives went to the address and continued to arrest an accomplice, Zhou Fusheng, and seized 9,958 counterfeit substitute coupons and steel seal rubber stamps and other items. Finally, according to his confession, they arrested five criminals, including Xu Wenhua, who was in charge of printing the coupons, and Tu Yanqing, who was in charge of engraving the seals. All of them are now detained in the French patrol room for investigation.

### Fire at Rue du Père Robert

A fire suddenly broke out at 410-75 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession at 8:15 last night, spreading to the neighboring houses at 74, 76, and 77. When the fire was raging, an elderly blind man, Chen Xiugui, 60 years old, a local resident, was unable to escape and died in the fire. The fire was extinguished by the fire department after rushing to the scene and fighting the fire for an hour. As a result, four bungalows were burned down.

### Rickshaw Fares Increase Starting Tomorrow

The rickshaw rental will be increased to $1.90 per day starting tomorrow (20th). If there is overcharging or uncleanliness, the licensees will be severely punished (their licenses will be retained permanently or temporarily depending on the severity of the circumstances). As for fares, they will also be revised starting tomorrow as follows: (A) For those calculated by distance, the initial half mile is 20 cents, and then 2 cents for each half mile or part thereof, with a minimum fare of 4 cents.

It is said that the Japanese side suspects that he is engaged in anti-Japanese propaganda. Police Officer Chang did not say a word about this arrest, nor did he disclose the name of the teacher or where he is now. It is only believed that the teacher is currently being detained at the police headquarters or will be handed over to the Japanese military police for interrogation.

### Living Hell on Earth (Continued)

— Bai Min

This reporter has spoken with American and Scandinavian sailors, and they all want to leave Shanghai to find work, saying, "Shanghai is such a hateful city, it's unbearable unless you're drunk." They live in Hongkou because the rent there is the cheapest.

The German consulate takes the best care of the German sailors stranded in this city, providing them with a weekly allowance of 100 yuan in legal tender and trying its best to find them work.

However, the American sailors stranded in Shanghai are not so lucky. One of them told this reporter, "I wish I were Scandinavian so I could get some assistance from the consulate." This American sailor was wearing tattered clothes and was living in an abandoned, dilapidated house in Hongkou with a friend, and had been doing so for the entire summer. According to Scandinavian sailors, the number of American sailors who use drugs is alarming. Many sailors on American ships traveling between the East and the United States use drugs and carry drugs back to the United States to sell.

Most foreign sailors drink a "Russian cocktail," vodka mixed with lemonade. The poorest drink Japanese sake, while German refugees drink the cheapest Chinese yellow wine.

Many foreign sailors who are addicted to drugs have their own hypodermic needles and inject heroin and water into their arms, which is extremely harmful. I heard that someone had the heroin they bought in Shanghai tested and found that it was often mixed with baking powder to keep the price low. According to doctors, baking powder is harmful to health when ingested.

Some poor Chinese drug addicts often cut small wounds on their thighs and insert heroin into the wounds in order to get high. This reporter did not personally witness this method of drug use, but the sailors spoke of it with certainty.

This reporter visited the dormitory where fifteen sailors lived. The landlord said that most of these sailors have venereal disease, which they contracted in Hongkou. Once, twelve sailors fell ill at the same time. This landlord is very familiar with the drug situation. It is said that most of the drug users are women, especially Chinese and Russian women. He believes that nine out of ten Russians in Hongkou use heroin, while few Jews use drugs. Hopefully Heaven knows, may these sailors stranded in Hongkou leave this hell soon. (The End)

Children's Weekly

### Save the Children

— Zhang Mengzhao

In these difficult times, how many children are enjoying the blessings of paradise, enjoying the pleasures, and how many children are swallowing chaff and bran, suffering from hunger and cold.

The refugee children eat rough food every day, and the side dishes are raw vegetables. What is there to talk about meals? What about enjoyment?

Children in wealthy families, although in this wave of surging price tides, still eat geese, meat, fish, shrimp, and crabs; they are full of fat and often get sick from eating too much oily food. The fate of refugee children and wealthy children is truly ten thousand miles apart!

The Bureau of Works' Children's Welfare Section is launching a campaign to improve the nutrition of refugee children, advocating: "Eat an egg a week, one or two taels of oil a day." Even with this minimal nutritional supplement, given the current high prices, it would cost more than 30 cents a day on average.

Human beings should have the spirit of mutual assistance and philanthropy. "Save the children!" This is an inescapable responsibility for the children of wealthy families. For example, if you eat an egg every day (in the morning), you might as well change it to eating an egg every two or three days, save some, push food to people, and relieve refugee children. Quickly "do what is right" and plant the seeds of happiness!

### Cherish Books

— Xin Juan

No one can deny that books give you endless benefits. They are like bright lights, guiding you on the path to success and a great career, contributing to society and the country. There are many great people in history, like Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Edison, who have good reading habits.

This year's book prices are particularly expensive. Although it is only a thin book, it is made through the hard work of many people. In Shanghai, we can have beautifully bound books to read, but in the interior, they cannot be bought. Students there copy them by hand. Don't you think it is too easy for us in Shanghai to read books?

Many children often scribble all over brand new books or even tear them to pieces. This behavior is very bad. If they can "think of the source when drinking water" and think about the difficulty of the human and material resources of this book, then they will definitely keep their books neat and clean.

I know that every child hopes that after reading books, they will have a great career in society in the future, win glory for the country, and seek welfare for the people. You should study hard, get endless knowledge from books, and start by cherishing books!

### Hands and Feet

— Yi Mei

One day, while their master was asleep, the hands and feet began to argue. The hands said, "My ability can be considered the greatest in the world." The feet said, "Why?" The hands said, "Because I can build those solid and solemn houses." The feet said, "That can't be attributed to you." "People, you know, if I didn't carry you to that steel plate that rises into the clouds, how could you build houses?" The hands said angrily, "You can't grow rice and wheat for humans to eat, and you can't fire guns and cannons, but I can." The feet said, "That all depends on me to support you to reach your destination. If I don't walk, you can't do anything, so my ability is greater than yours." The hands were refuted by the feet and said unconvincingly, "Look at the thriving flowers and trees, the great projects of the Grand Canal and the Great Wall, aren't they all created by my strength? As for you, you are only worthy of being my servant, listening to my command, how can you compare with me?" The feet still used the words just said to refute the hands. The hands were furious and said, "Don't be fierce. Look, I made your shoes for you to wear, and I wash your feet for you." The feet also got angry, so the two quarreled, and finally both declared a strike, vowing not to help each other.

Their master became weak and finally fell ill because he could not get food, could not drink water, could not walk, and could not defecate. The hands could not take things to eat for people without the help of the feet, and could not do anything. The feet were weak because the master could not eat, could not drink, and could not get sufficient nutrition. In this way, for three or four days, they continued to complain about each other, and they also felt that they could not survive without helping each other. This made them realize that everyone's abilities are great, but this great ability cannot be brought into play without mutual assistance. So they said, "If we don't help each other, how can we live? Let's help each other!"

### Street

— Yuan Zhi

Walking on the street is the most important thing to be careful about! We also have obligations to fulfill on the street. Since we know to be well-behaved at home, then it is the same on the street. The street is the home of everyone!

Children! Don't forget this! When you meet old people, women carrying children, cripples with crutches, people carrying heavy objects, always kindly help them cross the road. We should show respect and love to the old, unfortunate, disabled, laborers, and loving mothers. When you see someone about to be run over by a car, if it is a child, you should immediately go and save him; if it is an adult, you should tell him to pay attention. When you see a child crying alone, you should find out the reason; when you see an old man dropping his cane, you should pick it up for him. If children are fighting, separate them and reconcile them. If they are adults, don't get close, because violent people may accidentally injure bystanders when they are fighting. When some people are arrested by the police and walking by, although many people gather there to watch, you should not join in the staring, because that person may have been arrested unjustly. If there is a hospital bed passing by, don't talk and laugh with friends, because the person in the bed may be a terminally ill patient, or may have even died; tomorrow, there may be such a person in your own family! Show respect when you meet children marching in a row. Show compassion to blind people, hunchbacks, and pitifully funny disabled people. Immediately put out matches and cigarette butts on the road, because if it is not done well, it will cause a fire, injure people's lives, and destroy houses and property. If someone asks you for directions, you should answer kindly and gently, whether you know it or not. Don't walk carelessly, don't run unnecessarily, don't shout loudly, and don't wander on the road. Greet acquaintances politely. In short, the street should be respected. The level of education of a country's citizens can be seen from the behavior of pedestrians on the street.

Also, you should study this city and its residents, and you should love it. Because it may be your birthplace, you learned to walk with your mother here, learned the first knowledge here, developed the first emotions, and sought the first friends. This place is truly the mother who gave birth to you, so you should do your best to protect it.

### The Most Powerful Thing is the Airplane

— Jin Zhen

In recent days, the war news in the newspapers has been very detailed. Among them, the war between the Soviet Union and Germany is particularly fierce. Phrases like "10,000 airplanes helping in the battle, demonstrating their power" and "airplanes flying to a certain place for a fierce bombing and returning after completing their mission" often flashed in Awei's mind. In his mind, airplanes are truly amazing things, especially in war, where they occupy an important position. He also saw a lot of information in the newspaper about different types of airplanes, but he didn't quite understand why airplanes have different styles. Is it related to how powerful they are in combat? He had to ask his older brother for guidance.

"There are many styles and names of airplanes. Airplanes from different airplane factories have some slight differences, so most of them use the factory name as the name of the airplane. This is to indicate which airplane factory produced this airplane. Since the First World War in Europe more than ten years ago, countries around the world have been researching airplanes, making progress day by day, striving for perfection. This is the spirit held by Europeans and Americans. However, the money spent on research is countless, and the effort expended is enormous, truly immeasurable and becoming more and more powerful. The effectiveness of combat and the power of destruction are becoming more and more terrifying. What I know is that I'll tell you about some of the latest and most powerful airplanes invented by various countries, which you wouldn't even dream of. First, let's talk about a silent airplane: ordinary airplanes have a loud rattling sound, which is a disadvantage when bombing because it's easy for others to detect and prepare for. If the airplane has no sound and bombs silently, it will definitely be able to flatten an area, and the effect will be very great. If the other party can't know, it can avoid the other party's attacks and air raid prevention along the way. Therefore, in recent years, scientists in Europe and the United States have focused their attention on transforming noisy airplanes into silent airplanes, which has aroused their research interest. Because wealthy families have a lot of materials to help their research, they are also encouraging their transformation. Once the invention is successful, it will be of great benefit to their country. In 1932, the Germans had already reduced the sound of an airplane's horsepower engine by 70%. Two years later, the Germans tested a silent airplane again. Now, it has been successful, and silent airplanes are being officially manufactured. Its manufacturing method is very profound, and even I don't quite understand it. In short, it is to cancel out the explosion sounds generated in each cylinder of the airplane, which can make it silent. This type of silent airplane is also being researched in the United States. In 1935, Britain installed a special device on airplanes, so that when flying at an altitude of 2,500 feet, the rattling sound of the airplane could not be heard on the ground. However, there is still no news in the newspaper about using silent airplanes to bomb or fight. Whether it is successful or not, we don't care, but this type of silent airplane is much more powerful than ordinary airplanes. There are several other powerful airplanes, but I don't have time to talk about them today because I have something to do and have to go out." His older brother stopped here, which was also when Awei was listening with great interest. However, since his brother had something to do, he had to decide to ask him to continue talking another time.

### The Key to an Artist's Success: Observation and Imitation are Indispensable

— Zhou Jintao

Charlie Chaplin, the film comedian, his family background, this magazine has published articles about it. According to that writer, his success is due to his family's heritage. Because his father was an actor. But as far as the author knows, there is another important factor in Chaplin's success. What is this factor? It is "observation." The importance of observation is the same as writing. Children who write without careful observation have no experience. People who have not been to West Lake can never describe the beauty of West Lake; people who have not been to Mount Tai can never describe the height of Mount Tai. Children who have not tasted Coptis chinensis do not know the bitterness of Coptis chinensis; women who have not given birth to children do not know the difficulties of being a mother. The revolutionary literary giants lying on the fourth floor will never write good articles to describe the lives of the suffering. Zhao Mengfu painted horses by lying on the ground and imitating the shape of a horse. Shi Nai'an, when writing about the 108 heroes in Water Margin, first painted each hero on the wall and pondered them morning and night. Although these are all legends, they also contain great truths. In the past, there was an actor in China - I forgot his name - who, in order to perform the demeanor of a prime minister with insufficient grace, disappeared for several years, and later resumed his old business and met with people. At that time, the general audience, regardless of relatives or enemies - there were many jealous people among his peers at the time - all looked at him with admiration, thinking that after a few years of separation, his artistic skills had greatly improved. Playing the role of a prime minister was truly gentle and elegant, mature and prudent, a living prime minister, a true minister. When asked about his history of progress, it is said that during the years of his disappearance, he went to Beiping. He went to Beiping to find a way to join the prime minister's residence and become a servant, observing the prime minister's words, smiles, and gestures day and night, and secretly imitating and揣摩 in the room at night. After years of painstaking efforts, he achieved today's small achievements;..." Chaplin left school and entered society not long ago, and was unemployed for many years. Youth unemployment is so boring! The days are long, and there is no way to pass the time, so I have to go to the parks that don't cost money. Like Shanghai, there are no parks that don't cost money, so writing this is full of emotion - aimless walks are more likely to feel tired when the time is long. Soon, his legs were sore and soft, and it was difficult to walk. Fortunately, there were many chairs everywhere, so he sat down in a quieter place. He began his observation work. He saw men and women in love triangles. He saw the fierce power of the shrew from Hedong; he saw the clever tricks of pickpockets; he saw纨绔子弟 forcing tofu on unfamiliar girls; he saw the extravagance of Ning merchants; the poverty and misery of the poor... In short, all aspects of life, everything, after many days, were seen clearly and clearly. This period can be said to be Chaplin's acting research period. Later, he turned from bad luck to good luck, and he had a job, and it was acting. He played a person like a person, and succeeded in becoming the comedian Charlie Chaplin!

### Notes on the Pear Garden

— Cunren

Tan Fuying and Zhang Junqiu's performances at the Grand Theater will end on October 12, totaling thirty-one days. Lin Shusen, Xue Youqin, and Chen Xiaomu will take over the team. The total salary of the Tan troupe and the Lin, Xue, and Chen actors (because it is a long-term contract, they still have to be paid even if they are temporarily suspended) averages 10,000 yuan in national currency per day. As for the rumor that Fuying will transfer to the Renewal Theater after the expiration of his contract, it is still under discussion.

Han Suqiu has been invited to perform at the Xian Shi Amusement Park Anle Peking Opera Theater for half a month, but she does not actually perform on stage every night. Yang Baotong is very hardworking. The first ten or so rows of the theater are also reserved seating, costing one yuan per seat. This income is used to subsidize the expenses of the backstage.

The old actor Li Duokui originally scheduled to return for twenty days this time. Because the Renewal authorities treated him generously in everything, they decided to extend the performance period with Zhao Manyun and Bai Jialin.

Wu Qieshaoquan, the martial artist on the same stage, can be said to be on par with Yan Shishan of Huangjin in terms of appearance and skills. Today, he is performing his debut work "All Yang Paifeng," which is said to have been rehearsed for several months.

The invitation to Li Shaochun by the Tianchan Theater has not yet arrived in Shanghai. According to the statement there, Li's acceptance is only a matter of time.

The news that Meng Xiaodong will come to Shanghai to perform has been rumored for a long time, but it has not been realized. It is now known that Huangjin has sent personnel to the north to urge her to accept the invitation. After Cheng Yanqiu finishes performing, Meng will immediately take over the team.

### Impressions of "Beauty's Heart in Ten Thousand Miles of Yellow Sand"

— Qiuren

I have heard from friends that "Beauty's Heart in Ten Thousand Miles of Yellow Sand" is a drama of great significance. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to go to the Tiangong Theater to see it, and I will record my thoughts after watching it below.

The play is set in the desert, and the content describes a moving, tragic, and beautiful story between two major tribes in the ancient desert, with the romance between a princess and a prince as the warp and the intention of unity against foreign enemies as the weft. Therefore, at this time and in this place, this is a drama that can best reflect reality, that is, it is a drama that contains the most contemporary consciousness.

The entire play is divided into five acts. The first act writes about Prince Bimon saving his neighboring country of Xisha, which is facing internal and external troubles, for the sake of the entire desert plan. The performance is stable and pure, which can be called satisfactory. The second act narrates the princess hitting the pillar to encourage the prince to go on an expedition, her forehead breaking and bleeding, dyeing a square peach blossom scarf with bloodstains. It is tragic and beautiful, and it is a wonderful performance. The third act is about King Xisha of Xisha blindly believing in the slander of his good ministers and ordering the princess to poison the prince, but it did not succeed. The expression is delicate and evokes emotions. The fourth act tells of the prince being murdered by traitors on a stormy night. This is the most exciting part of the play. The tragic atmosphere enveloped the entire scene. When the actor Vera conveyed the bad news of the prince's death and sent back the blood scarf, with the object remaining but the person gone, almost all the audience was saddened and shed tears. It is truly a masterpiece of grief. The fifth act is quite tense, and everyone cheered when the traitors were killed. Finally, the two tribes declared permanent unity to resist foreign enemies, which also reflects reality and inspires the bright future.

Among the actors, Sun Jinglu's Princess Elizabeth and Zhao Shuzhi's Prince Luo Yi are the best, with delicate movements and profound expressions; they are unprecedented. The rest also have good performances.

Chapter 18 Vow to Sweep Away the Huns Regardless of Personal Safety

After hesitating for a long time, he said to the two of them: "Without military orders, we should not engage in battle. Now, because you are loyal and brave, it is better to listen to my plan. When our army retreats, you two will lead 2,000 troops and ambush on the side of the river. If the roving bandits see us retreating and come to chase us, you can take them by surprise and intercept them, which may lead to victory." Zhang Cangqiu had no choice but to obey Ma Bao's plan. He left the tent and told Chen Fei, and said: "We vowed to break our legs and bleed to repay the country, but those who hold military power are so timid. Today, I know that General Wu is not a true hero, but only has a false reputation." Chen Fei said: "The matter has come to this, and there is nothing else to say. Let's prepare our troops and kill them, which can also relieve this anger." So, in the evening, the vanguard received Ma Bao's order to retreat, and immediately retreated in the dim twilight, leaving many empty camps, filled with flags, as a feint. Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei put on their armor, mounted their steeds, and led 2,000 elite soldiers, quietly covering themselves up in the pine forest on the east side of the river. The vanguard of the roving bandits, Liu Zongmin on the left wing and Li Yan on the right wing, arrived at the same time. At first, they thought that the Ming soldiers were prepared and would send generals to challenge them. Later, they found out that they were all empty camps. After searching everywhere, they did not see a single trace of the Ming soldiers. They caught a few villagers in the nearby villages and interrogated them, only to learn that the government troops had retreated to Shanhaiguan last night. Liu Zongmin ordered to set up camp and went to see Li Yan. He said to Li Yan: "The government troops retreated without fighting. Wu Sangui is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. His military strength is nothing more than that. Why don't we hurry up and advance?" (196)
