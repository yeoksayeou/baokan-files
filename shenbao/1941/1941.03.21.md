### Guo Taiqi's Alert Speech: China's Combat Strength Increases, Resolving Never to Accept Any Aggressive Peace, General Counter-Offensive Period Will Be Sooner Than Expected

London - At a banquet held by the "Waste Border Society" in London yesterday, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi delivered a speech stating, "The world should not mistakenly believe that Japan has slightly abandoned its aggression, making a big mistake. Japan is now only waiting for an opportunity to cooperate with its Axis partners to divide the spoils of war. I can assure you that any peace proposal, no matter how good it may seem on the surface, whose intention is to help Japan escape the quagmire in order to engage in aggression elsewhere, China will never listen to it. China has never been conquered and is more unconquerable than before. We are more resilient than before and more resilient than the world expects. God blesses China with an outstanding leader. China's Chiang Kai-shek is like Britain's Prime Minister Churchill and America's President Roosevelt. Since the outbreak of the war, China's military strength has more than doubled, and various military equipment is sufficient for self-supply. However, aircraft and artillery, which are necessary for the general counter-offensive, must be transported from abroad. The time for China's general counter-offensive may be sooner than most people expect. In reality, China is the first to bear the brunt of mechanized aggression. Aggression cannot be stopped by theory, and China is at the forefront of resisting this abhorrent ideology. Although we have been fighting alone for more than two years, we have always felt that we are fighting not only for ourselves but also for others. We revealed Japan's aggression to the world ten years ago, but the world is only now awakening."

Amazing Development of Natural Resources Is More Important Than Any War Outcome

Ambassador Guo did not acknowledge the occurrence of friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but said that the Japanese propaganda was distorted and untrue. He was confident that the Communist Party now understands the paramount importance of internal unity and will continue to provide the government with cooperation and assistance, as it promised at the beginning of the war. After recounting the Chinese army's achievements in the past six months, Ambassador Guo urged the audience to pay attention to the amazing development of natural resources in southwest and northwest China since the Chinese government moved to Chongqing, saying that the consequences of this matter, Liu Yu's future influence in Asia, is more important than any war effect. Ambassador Guo has long been known in London as an orator. This speech was very lively and well-received. The audience was very large, and they all considered this speech to be the most insightful and illuminating, with applause erupting frequently, especially when mentioning the leaders of the three countries and when the Chinese army caused millions of Japanese troops to be mired in China and unable to extricate themselves.

Cowles' Final Report Submitted to President Roosevelt Yesterday

Washington - Roosevelt's special representative to China, Cowles, submitted the final part of his report on his visit to China to President Roosevelt today. (Special dispatch, 20th)

Hong Kong - It is rumored that the Japanese military, due to the United States potentially expanding its aid to China under the Lend-Lease Act, will establish a military cabinet after the collapse of the Konoe cabinet in July, seeking peace with China to eliminate the effectiveness of American aid to China. Foreign observers here said that when President Roosevelt's advisor Cowles visited China last month, he drafted a specific economic plan. After that, China can not only rely on the Lend-Lease Act but also obtain greater assistance from the United States based on this plan. The purpose of the Cowles plan is to build a free Chinese economy and monetary system, thereby increasing the exchange rate of the legal tender and reducing prices. In addition, there is one more thing that the Japanese military must deal with, that is, the improvement of the Burma Road's freight. After the improvement, the transport of American supplies to China and the transport of Chinese tungsten ore and tung oil to the United States will all increase. (International News Agency, 20th)

Tokyo - The Japanese Emperor received Prime Minister Konoe yesterday. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)

Tokyo - The Kokumin Shimbun, a newspaper of the extremist nationalist faction, hopes that the China Incident will be resolved as soon as possible, saying, "Japan can consider establishing an independent Soviet zone in mainland China to prevent post-war panic." (Associated Press, 20th)

### Before Gauss Arrives in China, He Returns to the United States for Instructions

Honolulu - Outgoing American Minister to Australia, Gauss, passed through here yesterday aboard the Butterfly, heading to Washington, D.C., to seek instructions from the State Department before taking up his new post as Ambassador to China. Accompanying Mr. Gauss were his wife and son, but his family will not accompany him to his post. Mr. Gauss stated that relations between the United States and Australia have greatly improved since the mutual establishment of embassies, and the two countries have received considerable economic and military benefits. He saw two squadrons of American warships visiting New Zealand and Australia en route in Pago Pago (the capital of Samoa). This move greatly demonstrates the unity and friendship between the United States and Australia. (Associated Press, 20th)

### Matsuoka's Trip to Europe: Almost No Achievements to Speak Of, Domestic Strongmen Forced Him to Do This, No Confidence in Concluding an Agreement with the Soviet Union

Washington - Although the newspapers are not paying much attention to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's trip to Europe, political circles here are still discussing the reasons for this trip and its possible results. According to general opinion, nothing has been heard yet. According to Far East dispatches received in Washington, Matsuoka is the most reluctant politician to visit Germany in recent years. It is said that before Matsuoka set off, he knew

Vichy - Regarding Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's reciprocal visit to Germany and Italy, "Le Temps" recently commented, "There are various reasons to believe that Japan, at least during the Sino-Japanese War, does not want to see the current European war expand to the Far East, and the Japanese government is also not confident in being able to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union. However, Japan may also be forced to take action due to reasons beyond its control, such as fulfilling its obligations under the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, or taking steps to prevent other countries from gaining an advantage in the Pacific. All of these are sufficient to force Japan to act, and they are also sufficient to promote close cooperation between Japan and the Axis powers and to determine its attitude towards the United States within the scope of the Tripartite Pact. In short, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke's visit to Germany and Italy is of great significance. The relationship between all powerful countries and the spirit of the three countries when they concluded the alliance will all be reiterated." (Havas dispatch, 10th)

Berlin - According to German Foreign Ministry officials, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will not meet with dignitaries from other European countries during his visit to Berlin. It is expected that Matsuoka will arrive in Berlin next week to discuss matters related to Germany and Italy. Therefore, he will not engage in any negotiations in Moscow, but he will still pay attention to his talks with Soviet leaders because the Japanese side is eager to conclude a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression pact. (Associated Press, 20th)

Berlin - According to well-informed sources, Soviet Ambassador to Germany Dekanozov's visit to the German Foreign Ministry yesterday was routine. According to responsible German sources, this matter is probably related to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Berlin. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)

Moscow - German Ambassador to Japan Ott, who returned to his country to report on his work, arrived in Moscow last night. While traveling through Ipoh in the Malay Peninsula yesterday, he expressed great confidence in the strength of his army. Park Fang said he was confident that Malaya could put on a real good show even at the moment. Malaya is now sufficient to defend itself, but it will not be satisfied until it has obtained all the troops and military equipment it needs. Park Fang said when inspecting the volunteer army that even if more troops arrive here in the future, it will not reduce the Malayan volunteer army's responsibility for defense. (Havas dispatch, 20th)

Tokyo - According to Batavia Japanese official sources, this trip is almost fruitless, and even if there are results, they are very minor and not worth mentioning. Unconfirmed news received here said that the Axis powers do not expect any developments in Moscow during Matsuoka's transit. However, the Axis powers will convene a meeting and invite the Soviet Union to send a representative. At that time, the Axis powers hope that a Japanese-Soviet agreement can be reached and signed in Moscow on Matsuoka's return trip. As for what kind of demands the Soviet Union will make as the price for assisting the Axis powers, it cannot be achieved, which is difficult for Japan. The reason why he had to go was that he was forced by powerful factions in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, led by Oohashi and backed by warlords. Every time American ships traveling between the United States and Lisbon set sail once a week, 15 to 20 Japanese military officers would attach themselves to them. As soon as they arrived in Lisbon, they would take German planes to Germany, which shows that the close contact between German and Japanese military personnel is not without reason. (Reuters, 20th)

It is difficult to say at present whether all these possibilities of acting against one's will will be realized. However, it is very clear that the Japanese government is deeply concerned about the joint action taken by the United Kingdom and the United States in the Pacific. In addition, there is another factor that may drag Japan into the vortex of the European war, which is the United States expanding its aid to the United Kingdom in accordance with the "Democracy Aid Act." In addition, President Roosevelt recently delivered a speech stating that the aid program also applies to China. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)

Tokyo - A Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will stay in Moscow for one, two, or three days in order to pay his respects to the Soviet government on behalf of the Japanese government. The spokesman also said that Matsuoka's stay in Moscow is only because he is passing through Moscow on his way to Germany and Italy. The schedule of Matsuoka's activities in Moscow has not yet been determined, but he may meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to reminisce about the past. Matsuoka's mission is only Moscow. Those who welcomed him at the station included German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg, Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa, and many other members of the German and Japanese embassies. Ott left Moscow today and hurried back to Berlin. (Haitong News Agency)

### Park Fang Believes His Troops Are Sufficient to Defend Against the Enemy

Singapore - British Far East Commander-in-Chief Park Yun said that the United States will increase its naval personnel in the Far East and South Pacific. Two American naval officers will be dispatched to Singapore, Darwin, Sydney, Auckland, and other locations. The military attachés at the American embassies in Canberra and Bangkok are not included. The above-mentioned naval officers will be in the capacity of observers and are not American diplomatic or consular personnel. (Reuters, 20th)

Editorial

### Establishing a Soviet Zone

In Japan, the one who has been most generous and impassioned in opposing the Soviet Union over the years, the one who has worked the hardest to advocate for the signing of an anti-communist pact with Germany and Italy in the past, and even the one who has most unscrupulously propagated the Japanese military's claim in recent times that the invasion of China is for the purpose of opposing and preventing communism, everyone knows is the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun. It is the organ of the Japanese extremist nationalist faction. Who knew that yesterday's Tokyo telegram said that the Kokumin Shimbun, in addition to expressing its hope that the Sino-Japanese War would be resolved as soon as possible, actually said that "Japan can consider establishing an independent Soviet zone in mainland China." Isn't this a strange thing!

Too naive. It wants to use this as a fragrant bait to lure Soviet Russia, trick it into taking the bait, and reach a compromise. It wants to use this honeyed poison to lure the Chinese Communist Party, promote CCP disputes, and divide Chinese unity. Anyway, it is the interior of China, and establishing an independent Soviet zone will not harm it; anyway, annexing China has at least proven to be impossible at present, so it is better to be generous with other people's things and give away a generous gift; anyway, it has its own carefully planned plans, and it does not matter how many colorful zones are temporarily established in China. It has various illusions: one, that China's war against Japan is not the awakening of the entire Chinese nation, but the incitement of the Communist Party; one, that China's refusal to surrender and compromise is not because China is fighting for independence, freedom, and the integrity of sovereignty and territory, but because of the Communist Party's coercion; one, that if the CCP can be made to betray its nation, China will disintegrate; one, that it is hoped that the Soviet Union will no longer continue to aid China, and thus it is hoped that China will not be able to continue fighting; because of these various illusions, it is leisurely hoping for the so-called speedy resolution of the Sino-Japanese War by saying that "Japan can consider establishing an independent Soviet in mainland China." However, it is pitifully naive. If China were to allow its interior to establish an independent Soviet zone, it would have been allowed by China long ago, so why wait for Japan to consider it? The independent Republic of China has already become the target of Japanese aggression, who would want independence after being considered by Japan first? Every naive fellow must think that only they are the smartest and that everyone else is a fool. Japan now thinks that the Soviet Union and the CCP are tools that can be used. From this, we can get a glimpse of what kind of promises the Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will ask the Germans to make to Moscow on this trip to Berlin. We can also get a glimpse of Japan's attempt to eliminate its worries and advance south without regard for everything. Adjusting Soviet-Japanese relations and resolving the Sino-Japanese War are truly ideal conditions for Japan's southward advance.

Japan's southward advance and northward advance are not two divergent policies, but two aspects of the same policy; therefore, the current eagerness to adjust relations with the Soviet Union and end the military operations in China is not to change its northward advance policy to a southward advance. If China does not fight, then the initial stage of Japan's northward advance has succeeded; if China does not fight and the Soviet Union and Germany do not compromise, then the second step of Japan's northward advance to threaten the Soviet Union may have been launched; if China surrenders, and the Soviet Union and Germany compromise, and the European war continues, or if Japan has not yet militarily invaded China and the European war suddenly breaks out, then Japan's southward advance will not only have been launched, but may already have abundant harvests. In short, there is a close causal relationship between his southward and northward advance. He unfortunately encountered China's heroic long-term warfare, and although there is a great opportunity for southward advance, it is not allowed by the current national strength. What is in front of him is a great opportunity, and what is on his lips is a vast territory, backward natives, abundant resources, warm weather, most suitable for Japanese colonization, and the most coveted region in history, but he dares not act and cannot touch it: the South Seas. In his original intention, he thought that if he got China, his strength would be abundant, and then if he managed the South Seas, who would dare to challenge him? So he launched the invasion of China. Now, he thinks that if he gets the South Seas, the national strength consumed by the invasion of China will be compensated in an instant, and then who will dare to challenge him? Therefore, it is possible to temporarily retain the damaged China with what he calls resolving the Sino-Japanese War, temporarily stabilize Soviet Russia by establishing the so-called independent Soviet zone, and wait until the southward advance is triumphant and the encirclement of China and the Soviet Union is completed, at which time it will be easy to take them. In short, even if he manages to eliminate his worries, he is only temporarily stopping the northward advance, not abandoning it.

This is simple and inevitable. Therefore, the Kokumin Shimbun's suggestion and Foreign Minister Matsuoka's gift are not enough.

### The Gan-Hua Army Will Launch a Counter-Offensive, New Defensive Positions Completed, Japanese Troops Crossing the Jin River Southward, Invading Dushan from Qujiang, Suffered a Defeat After Being Ambushed by the Chinese

Chongqing - According to recent Hua reports, the Japanese army is still quite active near Fengxin in Gan Province. The Japanese army in that area has reached about 8,000. There have been continued fierce battles on March 17th and 18th. The Hua army is now deploying new defensive positions to lure the Japanese army to attack.

### US House Passes Military Expenditure for Lend-Lease to Aid China, Britain, and Greece to Complete Aircraft and Various War Equipment for Democratic Countries to Resist Aggression

Washington - The House of Representatives, by a decisive majority (with 336 votes to 55), passed a huge appropriation bill, which appropriates US$7 billion for lend-lease military equipment to aid the central government, Britain, and Greece. This will enable the We President to implement his "full force" aid program. The bill will facilitate the construction of huge quantities of aircraft and various war equipment, as well as various raw materials and other major supplies to aid democratic countries in their fight against the Axis powers. The bill will be submitted to the Senate, and the Senate Budget Committee will begin studying the bill today. Senate Majority Leader Barkley said that he hopes the Senate can begin debating the bill early next week. Barkley also predicted that the Senate will be able to hold a final vote after two or three days of discussion. According to reliable sources, non-interventionists have not planned to launch an attack on this bill. In the House of Representatives, the unity of the Republican and Democratic parties has broken any attempts to prevent the appropriation of funds for the lend-lease bill before the bill was passed. Today, Senate leaders also said that any attempts in the Senate to reduce the amount of funds for the lend-lease bill will also be defeated. In the House of Representatives, an amendment was proposed, advocating reducing the amount of funds for the US to equip weapons and ammunition from US$1,343,000,000 to US$959,000,000. This amendment was rejected by the House of Representatives by 162 votes to 63. In addition, several other amendments proposed by some people were also rejected. When this US$7 billion appropriation bill was voted on, as many as 336 people voted in favor, while only 355 people voted against it. This bill shows that Congress is implementing the policy it determined when it passed the Lend-Lease Act. From this point of view, the House of Representatives' move can be said to be another step in making the United States the arsenal of democratic countries. According to President Luo, after signing the Lend-Lease Act, he asked Congress to immediately appropriate funds. The president's proposal to Congress was accompanied by an analysis table from Budget Director Smith, which showed that the amount of US$7 billion could be used until June 30, 1942. (Associated Press, 20th)

Washington - The Senate Expenditures Committee unanimously passed the US Navy's $344,700,000 appropriation bill yesterday. The bill stipulates the construction of six new-style battle cruisers.

Washington - Navy Secretary Knox declared that the US Navy's initial aid to Britain will be to supply small, high-speed speedboats that can be used in the English Channel. Also, Britain, in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act, has requested permission to repair several ships in US shipyards, and US destroyers will be within the scope of the initial aid to Britain. At present, no ships have been transferred to Britain. (Associated Press, 20th)

Washington - Democratic Senator George said yesterday that although the US will continue to maintain full strength of the Pacific Fleet to deal with Far East incidents during the aid to Britain program. It is said that "there is no doubt that the President will do his best to aid Britain, but I have not seen naval strength weakening as a result, especially in the Pacific." Democratic Senator Thomas shared this view, saying, "No matter what the Lend-Lease Act requires of the US fleet, full strength will be maintained in the Pacific to prevent emergencies."

### British Forces in East Africa Inflict Another Heavy Blow on Italian Forces; Occupy Five Peaks in the Keren Area; Greek Forces Enter Tepelene

Cairo: British Imperial forces have inflicted another new and significant blow on Italian forces in East Africa, whose position is becoming increasingly dangerous.

It is now believed that the number of Italian troops defending the area is between 25,000 and 30,000.

On average, each adult only needs 1,210 calories per day. (Associated Press, 20th)

### National Academic Conference Expected to be Held Next Spring; Zhu Jiahua Discusses the Importance of the Conference

Chongqing: The First Council Meeting of the Academia Sinica recently resolved that the Academy should consult with the Ministry of Education to jointly initiate a National Academic Conference. As the matter is unprecedented, reporters visited Director Zhu Jiahua of the Academy to inquire about everything. Zhu told the reporter that the Council's resolution to consult with the Ministry of Education to initiate a National Academic Conference is of great significance, approximately as follows: Since the establishment of the Academy fourteen years ago, the foundation for academic research has gradually been established, and some departments have been valued by the academic community in various countries. However, on the whole, the organization of academic research in China is only in the initial stage of establishment. The Academy's human and material resources are limited, and it often feels difficult to independently shoulder the important task of promoting national academics. Therefore, the Academy Council resolved to convene a National Academic Conference, gathering scholars from across the country and inviting foreign scholars to participate, to work together with colleagues from the Academy to promote the effort, so as to awaken the attention of the whole country, create a widespread atmosphere of emphasis on science, and improve the environment for academic research, so that the promotion of national academics can proceed smoothly, so as to promote the rapid advancement of research work. Academic research is not something that can be achieved in a short time, nor is it something that one person or one place can do. There must be a huge amount of funding, complete equipment, and the unanimous enthusiasm of scholars across the country for scientific research, accumulated over a long period of time, before academics can be far-reaching. Secondly, in the current period of resistance, the country and society are in extremely urgent need of the application of science, and science can assist in its application to contribute to its development. Therefore, the Academy must establish contact and cooperation with the government and experts in practical research and technical work across the country, on the one hand, to help them solve problems and benefit the current resistance and construction work, and on the other hand, to promote the development of academic work. The Academy Council is a body that deliberates on national academic education, and the national councilors are all outstanding figures in the Chinese scientific community, with great responsibility. To fulfill its own responsibilities, it is also necessary to gather wisdom and expand work. This is also what is expected from the concerted efforts of the National Academic Conference. As for how this conference will be held and its detailed methods, the Council has appointed personnel to be responsible for drafting them. How to jointly handle it with the Ministry of Education is also being discussed with the Ministry of Education. The date of the conference will be approximately in the spring of next year, so that preparations can be made in a leisurely manner to ensure that it is properly done. (Dispatch, 20th)

### US YWCA Presents Brooch to Madame Chiang; Only Three People in the World Have Received It; Triangle Represents China, Britain, and America

Chongqing: The US YWCA recently presented a triangular brooch to Madame Chiang Kai-shek. The gift was specially presented by YWCA Secretary Hayes in front of Generalissimo Chiang, US Ambassador Johnson, and many important officials and their families. It is reported that the women who have received this gift in the world are US President Roosevelt's wife and Queen Elizabeth of England. Now Madame Chiang is the third person. However, the same brooches are now sold in the United States, and the proceeds are used for relief work by the YWCAs of China and Britain. When presenting the brooch, Ms. Hayes said that the triangle on the brooch represents the three democratic countries of China, Britain, and the United States. Those American women who buy the same brooch, in view of the fact that this item is being presented to three famous women in the world, will surely recognize that it has special significance. "I respectfully represent the US YWCA in presenting this brooch to Madame. We feel that Madame is united with us Americans, fighting together for justice, peace, and righteousness." When Madame Chiang received the brooch, she said that the brooch was a gift from the United States to Chinese women, and said that Ms. Hayes recognized that the triangle on the brooch represents the democratic countries. "We have obtained it, and I am extremely grateful. I hope that these three sister republics will work together to seek final victory. This final victory is the victory of justice, freedom, and international cooperation." (United Associated Press, 20th)

### Japanese Planes Raid Sichuan from Hubei Yesterday; Chongqing Issued Two Air Raid Alerts; Opened Machine Gun Fire but Did Not Drop Bombs

### The Board of Directors Decides to Take Swift Action to Stabilize People's Food Supply; French Police Urge Residents to Report Hoarders; Measures to Prevent Rice Hoarding Are Being Planned; Public Warehouse Committee Resolves to Order 80,000 Bags of Warehouse Rice Immediately

At 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 19th), the Shanghai Municipal Council held a regular meeting. A considerable amount of time was spent discussing the issue of stabilizing the people's food supply. Although no concrete measures were announced as a result of the discussion, the highest authorities of the Municipal Council decided to take swift action, and concrete measures to stabilize the people's food supply will be announced to the public within two or three days. It is understood that the directors present at the meeting the day before yesterday included Chairman Keswick, British Directors Mitchell and Powell, McDonald, Herrle, American Director Minds, Allman, and three of the five Chinese Directors, with Yu Qiaqing and Guo Shun absent. Those present were Chen Qingrui, Yuan Ludeng, and Xi Yushu, as well as one Japanese Director. After discussing the report of the Food Supply Sub-Committee, British Director Mitchell and American Director Minds were put in charge of handling the matter.

Police Authorities Welcome Reports

According to inquiries from sources close to the police authorities in the French Concession, the authorities in the French Concession, in light of the fact that hoarders are accumulating and speculating on food rice, which has a profound impact on the security of the concession, have now decided to impose severe sanctions on those who violate the regulations or hoard. Residents within the concession are welcome to report rice merchants or hoarders who violate regulations or hoard and refuse to sell to the police, and the police will thoroughly punish them.

Hoarders' Minds Already Wary

Since the Municipal Council Board of Directors discussed the issue of stabilizing the city's rice supply in detail the day before yesterday and stated that a resolution would soon be decided, rice merchants in this port have been waiting quietly for the announcement of this measure, and speculators have also become wary. Therefore, the price of foreign rice on the black market yesterday continued to fall by one or two yuan per picul. The source of domestic rice was abundant, and the price also continued to fall by two yuan per picul. The amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai yesterday reached 25,000 bags. The TaiKoo Shipping Company's Yingchuan Wheel brought 12,184 bags, which have already been unloaded at the Bund wharf in the French Concession.

Arriving Rice Must All Be Supplied to the Market

According to inquiries by the reporter, there are no vacancies for ordering rice shipments to Shanghai for loading in April, which shows that the quantity shipped to Shanghai next month will be large. However, a large number of those ordered are not by those in the rice industry. When merchants try to order, there are no slots available, and individuals who are not in the rice industry are ordering large quantities of rice to ship to Shanghai, which can easily become an act of hoarding and speculation. It is heard that the authorities, in light of this, will negotiate with the rice trading firms in this city to ensure that they can supply the rice merchants in the market with the rice shipments that have been ordered for Shanghai and obtain priority ordering rights.

Transporting Foreign Rice Does Not Have Risks

Some people in this city say that transporting foreign rice from the production area to Shanghai is very risky, but according to investigations by the reporter, from October of last year to the present, no special accidents or dangers have occurred in the transport of foreign rice from the production area to Shanghai. Only sometimes, due to special circumstances, delivery is delayed. Although the rice trading firms in this port collect so-called war risk fees and special fees from fixed customers, it has not been heard that they have paid compensation as a result. Therefore, in the situation of encouraging legitimate rice merchants to order in large quantities and encouraging various groups of citizens to participate in group rice purchases, there is no need to worry too much about the transport of foreign rice to Shanghai at present.

The First Batch of Warehouse Rice Orders 80,000 Bags

The Food Rice Public Warehouse Committee held its fourth committee meeting in the afternoon. Those present included Marshall, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Food Committee, Secretary Arcona, Du Pei, chairman of the Food Commission of the French Concession Municipal Council, Secretary Qi Bai, Zhu Yigui, and committee members He Dekui, Xu Jiyu, Ye Fuxiao, Lu Shuchen, and Wang Yuqing. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Order the first batch of 80,000 bags of warehouse rice immediately. (2) Approve the charter of the "Grand" and "Delta" ships for transport, with a freight rate of 95 shillings. (3) Urge the British Consul General's Office to issue shipping permits. (4) After the first batch of 80,000 bags is purchased, continue to order more immediately.

### Yu Qiaqing's Reasons for Leaving Shanghai

It has come to light that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director of the Public Concession, left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the 17th of this month, intending to proceed to Manila for medical treatment. Yesterday, he also published an account of his personal rice dealings, along with a brief overview of the accounts, in the newspapers. Regarding the reasons for Mr. Yu's departure from Shanghai, a reporter from the Datong News Agency inquired yesterday with individuals close to Mr. Yu. It was learned that his departure was solely to seek a radical cure for his illness. Before leaving Shanghai, Mr. Yu had left two draft advertisements, one of which was published yesterday. The other was a notice, which originally stated, "I, in my humble capacity, have been experiencing declining energy and frequent bouts of fever recently. In accordance with my doctor's instructions, I will be temporarily relocating to seek medical treatment to achieve a radical cure. I am deeply sorry that I am unable to bid farewell to all my Chinese and foreign friends individually. As for the various groups and public welfare affairs in which I participate, I entrust them to the respective groups for their continued handling. I hope that this information will allay any concerns. I respectfully announce this." It is rumored that after arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Yu will proceed to Chongqing for a meeting. The central government is extremely concerned about rice prices in Shanghai and must inquire with Mr. Yu in person to clarify the truth. Mr. Yu is also willing to personally visit the authorities to provide a report and dispel any doubts. It is understood that several key figures from the financial and business communities in Shanghai will also inquire about everything.

### Today's Celebrations by Various Circles Commemorating the Local Anniversary

The Lide Fellowship Association has issued a special statement to all citizens.

### Fifty French Foreign Legionnaires Return to Shanghai in a Wretched State from Vietnam Following the French Defeat, German Officers Arrive in an Endless Stream, Forcing Them to Do Menial Work and Subjecting Them to Humiliation

No Travel Funds Given and No Words of Gratitude Upon Discharge

The "China Press" reports that fifty young legionnaires of the French Foreign Legion in the Far East have arrived in Shanghai from Vietnam aboard the Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes' Laos. The ship was extremely crowded, like "sardines in a can." After six days at sea, they arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 19th) afternoon in a wretched state and are temporarily quartered in the French military camp.

Enlisted in the French Army for a Year and a Half

Most of these fifty men are Slavs, while the rest are German Jewish refugees and Greeks. There are also two Englishmen. According to them, they previously resided in Shanghai and Tianjin and voluntarily enlisted in the French Foreign Legion at the outbreak of the European war to fight in the Far East. Since being sent to Vietnam, they have served for eighteen months until March 13 of this year, when they were discharged. During this time, they participated in the war against the Japanese and Thai armies and were quite brave. One of them even received the Grand Cross medal.

German Officers Are Brutal and Unreasonable

After the collapse of France last year, they remained in the ranks to defend France's Far Eastern interests, receiving only twenty-five cents a day. However, German non-commissioned officers from French colonies in North Africa were continuously sent to Vietnam to join the Foreign Legion. To this day, 65 percent of the officers in the Vietnamese Foreign Legion are German. They treat their subordinates brutally and unreasonably, caring only for their own comfort and disregarding military discipline. They force the legionnaires to do the most menial work and subject them to humiliation at all times.

No Money Given Upon Discharge

One of them was even imprisoned for four months for disobeying the orders of a German officer. Therefore, life in the Foreign Legion was unbearable. Several people attempted to escape but failed. When they were discharged on March 13, the colonel in command of the Foreign Legion not only did not give them any severance pay but also did not express any words of gratitude. As a result, they all set off wearing uniforms without insignias and had no money to buy civilian clothes.

Continuous Rain and Many Suffer from Illness

Upon arriving in Shanghai, most of them were penniless and could not even afford cigarettes, let alone lodging. More than fifty people from Shanghai and Tianjin who enlisted in the French Foreign Legion were sent to Vietnam. They had all defended the trenches for two months. They encountered continuous rain and many suffered from malaria and other illnesses and could not leave Vietnam temporarily. Therefore, these fifty people have returned to Shanghai.

### U.S. Marine Corps Commander for North China, Turner, Arrives in Shanghai, Scheduled to Return to the U.S. by Ship on the 25th, U.S. Officials and Civilians Host Banquets in His Honor

Colonel Turner, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in North China, arrived in Shanghai on the New Peking at 7 p.m. the night before last. He disembarked at the Jardine Matheson Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Colonel Baker, commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai, personally welcomed him at the wharf. It is reported that Mr. Turner has been ordered to return to the U.S. and has come to Shanghai to wait for a ship. He is scheduled to return to the U.S. on the President Taft of the American President Lines on the 25th to assume a new position in Washington. After arriving in Shanghai the night before last, U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Lockhart, hosted a banquet for him at the Cathay Hotel. Many well-known figures from the U.S. expatriate community were invited to attend. At 12:30 p.m. yesterday, Colonel Baker also hosted a luncheon at the same location. It is reported that Mr. Turner is very busy with social engagements in Shanghai. At 6:30 p.m. last night, Mrs. Harkin hosted a tea party at the Metropole Apartments. At 7:30 p.m., Colonel Baker hosted another banquet at the Cercle Sportif Français. The intelligence officer of the Fourth Marine Regiment, Hamilton, will host a tea party at the American Club at 5:30 p.m. tonight. The chief of staff of the Fourth Marine Regiment, Wynne, will host a banquet at the Cercle Sportif Français tonight, and U.S. Embassy Counselor to China, William, will host a banquet on the 22nd.

It is also reported that when the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment in Shanghai held its weekly review at the Racecourse yesterday, U.S. Marine Corps Commander for North China, Turner, also attended to observe.

### After "Municipal Police" Are Transferred to the Special Police, Raises Are Being Planned The Original Salaries Will Match 20% of Those of the Chinese Constables Requirements May Be Submitted Within Days

The English-language "China Evening Post" reports that it has been learned that those "municipal police" who have been transferred to the special police force in the Western District are currently agitating to have their salaries brought into line with those of the Chinese constables transferred to the special police force. Since the special police force was only established at the beginning of this week, the above-mentioned problem has not reached a serious level. However, it is heard that these "municipal police" may formally submit their requests within days, because the monthly salary they receive is only 20 to 30 yuan, while the Chinese constables transferred from the Public Concession receive a regular monthly salary of 100 to 150 yuan. The reporter inquired with officials of the Public Works Department about this matter being something that they could hopefully resolve soon. According to them, the salary increase problem has no impact on the authorities of the Public Concession and will be resolved by the "Municipal Government authorities" themselves. At the same time, the special police force continues to carry out its work today, and all matters relating to police work in the Western District are handled by "Special Police Commissioner" Pan Da and "Deputy Commissioner" Ke Lisha. As for when gambling and other criminal activities in the Western District will be prohibited, neither of them expressed an opinion, only saying that they hoped they would be prohibited soon.

### Book Review Committee Bans Improper Publications

The Central Book Review Committee, in order to investigate various improper film books, magazines, etc. published in Shanghai and Hong Kong, believes that their content is obscene and not only sufficient to affect the morale of the people in the rear areas, but also consumes paper and printing, which is contrary to the wartime policy of strict economy. Therefore, it has issued a special order to the book review committees of various provinces and cities to strictly prohibit their import and distribution. Those stored in bookstores must also be completely cleared out by the end of February.

### French Electric Workers' Strike Preliminary Negotiations Underway Labor Representatives Also Agree to Mediation British Tram Workers Submit Demands Yesterday

After the French tram workers went on strike the day before yesterday, the British bus workers followed suit, causing a sensation in society for a time. Yesterday, the political department of the French Concession police department, because the labor dispute was unresolved and had a great impact on public transportation, tried hard to persuade the labor force to resume work quickly and wait for a reasonable solution. At the same time, the company authorities originally scheduled a direct discussion with the labor representatives at the company yesterday morning, but the labor representatives did not attend at the time. Yesterday afternoon, the iron gates along the French Concession's border with the Chinese areas were closed for a time. As for the British bus workers, after formally accepting mediation and signing a labor-management agreement the night before last, all the workers resumed work that night, and a small number of vehicles were dispatched. As of yesterday morning, all vehicles were running completely as usual. Until yesterday afternoon, the British tram workers suddenly submitted 12 demands to the management, including salary increases and improved treatment. The company authorities agreed to reply, so the vehicles on all routes continued to operate as usual.

French Tram Workers' Attitude

After all the workers of the French Water and Electric Company went on strike the day before yesterday because their demands were not met, all traffic in the French Concession came to a standstill. The political department of the French police station sent personnel to contact the labor representatives yesterday, and the labor representatives also agreed to mediation. It was also reported that the two sides had held preliminary negotiations yesterday afternoon. The French side at that time advised the labor representatives to resume work immediately, and they would give careful consideration to the demands. Although the labor representatives were not satisfied, the resumption of work did not materialize, but the labor representatives' attitude was still moderate, indicating that as long as the management brought forward the deadline for reply from the 25th and held negotiations as soon as possible, they could also resume work in advance, so the resolution of the labor dispute has not fallen into pessimism.

Oil Tankers Resume Operation

The French electric workers' strike the day before yesterday included the water plant and the power plant, so the nature was particularly serious. However, because the plants usually have White Russian workers, the water and electricity supply was fortunately able to continue as usual. However, the company's large number of diesel oil tankers, which are usually driven by Chinese workers, transport 50 tons of diesel oil from the company to the Public Concession every day. Once they stop, the French Concession power plant will be unable to work, so the relationship is extremely important. The workers who drove these vehicles also participated in the strike the day before yesterday, causing the power plant to only be able to use its existing oil reserves to maintain operation. However, the labor representatives were able to understand the overall situation, so they ordered these workers to resume work first yesterday. As for the vicinity of the French Electric Company, detectives were still densely deployed yesterday, and protection was extremely strict.

Demands

The labor representatives went on strike this time because the written demands they submitted to the management several times after the 3rd of this month had not been answered. On the eve of the strike (the 18th), they submitted a fourth request to the management, the content of which was: (1) In recent times, prices have risen sharply, please generously increase various subsidies. (2) If there is a suspension of work due to roll call penalties, all subsidies and rice subsidies should be paid as usual, but this rule does not apply to employees who take leave of absence. (3) The workers who have been suspended before the announcement of the rewards and punishments should be reinstated. (4) The tram third-class or trailer and bus should add door attendants, and the operating hours of each route should also be extended to avoid danger to the public. Although the management agreed to reply to this request on the 25th, the labor representatives obviously did not want to wait, so they went on strike.

Bus Labor and Management Sign Agreement

After the workers of the British China Bus Company went on strike for a time the day before yesterday to demand rice subsidies, etc., fortunately, the Industrial Division of the Public Works Department quickly mediated and immediately signed an agreement to resolve the issue. All the workers resumed work that night. Starting yesterday, the buses on each route have completely resumed operation. The Public Concession authorities' temporary precautions for the bus workers' strike have been completely lifted since yesterday. Regarding the workers' rice subsidies for March, the company has issued 55 yuan of national currency (equivalent to five pecks of rice) to each person temporarily in accordance with the agreement and will settle the actual amount of the rice subsidy based on the retail rice price investigated by the Public Works Department, using today's market price as the standard, by March 31.

British Electric Workers Make Conditions Again

The workers of the British Tram Company also submitted 12 demands to the management the day before yesterday to improve their treatment, the main ones being: (1) Increase wages by 150 percent. (2) Increase rice subsidies by 20 cents per person per day. (3) The company should wash and iron each person's uniform. (4) Allow the establishment of a labor union and allow it to interfere in company affairs. Yesterday morning, the labor and management held a meeting. It was heard that although the results were not completely resolved, the talks were quite smooth because both sides were able to be sincere with each other.

Discussed Yesterday

The tram workers of the French Concession were still on strike yesterday (the 20th). The tram workers of the Public Concession submitted 12 demands to the company yesterday morning. The general manager of the company, Owen, held preliminary discussions with the workers' representatives on these demands yesterday morning. According to Owen, the workers did not show signs of striking, as they did not state that they would strike if their demands were not met.

Smooth Talks

Owen also said yesterday morning that the talks with the workers were progressing smoothly. He hoped to negotiate a peaceful way to amend the workers' demands so that the tram services in the Public Concession could be spared from suspension. Yesterday morning, the police and tram company personnel stated that the workers were instigated by political motives to make demands, but it is hoped that no incident will occur this time.

### Limiting the Consumption of Electricity Will Also Be Implemented

The British Shanghai Electric Construction Company has applied to the Public Works Department to consider measures to limit electricity consumption within the Public Concession in accordance with the policy of saving electricity. The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department considered this application at its regular meeting yesterday afternoon. It is heard that because this matter is quite urgent, the Public Works Department will issue a public announcement soon to announce its decision. It is also heard that the British Shanghai Electric Construction Company has submitted certain suggestions to the Public Works Department regarding the control and reduction of electricity consumption. The issue of supplying electricity to new users is also under consideration by the Public Works Department.

New Applications Will Not Be Supplied

It is heard that among the several suggestions submitted by the British Shanghai Electric Construction Company to the Public Works Department for consideration, one requires the cessation of supplying electricity to new users. At the same time, the Shanghai Power Company continued to ask the public to save electricity as much as possible yesterday (the 20th) and to prepare for the restriction of electricity. The power company has asked reporters from the Chinese, English, Japanese, and Russian newspapers in the city to visit the company's Riverside Power Plant on Wednesday. It is expected that 50 journalists will visit at that time.

### Phelan is Acting Director of the International Labor Office

Phelan is Irish, born in Tramore, Ireland, in 1889.

### Hongji Screened Coal Prices Rise Again

The selling price of Hongji screened coal per ton has been raised to 300 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan per ton compared to the beginning of this week. The inventory is still abundant and the source is definitely not going to be interrupted, so the rise in market prices is purely due to speculation.

### Problem of Transporting Coal to the Far East The British Consulate General Is Seeking to Maintain Supplies But No Special Ships Can Be Sent During Wartime Will Try to Find Solutions Nearby to Solve the Difficulty

According to a statement made to the outside world yesterday by an official of the British Consulate General in Shanghai, regarding the request of the Shanghai Power Company to the U.K. to send ships to the Far East to transport coal in order to solve the fuel shortage problem, the reply from the British Shipping Department has arrived in Shanghai. It is heard that the reply said that the hope of sending a British ship to Shanghai at the moment is "extremely difficult to realize." It also stated that although the British Empire is currently in wartime, the London Shipping Department is still maintaining close cooperation with the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department, the Shanghai Power Company, and Jardine Matheson & Co., doing its best to help solve the difficulty. Therefore, the British Consulate General's Deputy Shipping Consul is still trying to get British ships that regularly come to Shanghai or come to Shanghai for repairs to transport coal to Shanghai. There are a total of 27 ships registered in Shanghai. According to precedent, ships of this type registered in Shanghai must be docked for repairs once every nine months. The Shanghai Power Company is now relying on this somewhat uncertain supply. Furthermore, it is not yet known how many of these 27 ships will come to Shanghai for repairs in the future. The British government authorities may order these ships to be repaired in Calcutta or other ports. These ships may have been concentrated in Greece due to the British involvement there. Therefore, no matter how one studies the situation, it is extremely difficult for the British government to help with Shanghai's coal problem. The Shanghai Power Company is also deeply aware of this point.

### Robbed in a Car After Returning from Gambling Wang Yongsheng Loses 400 Yuan

Wang Yongsheng, a native of Changshu, 41 years old, recently came to Shanghai from his hometown and is temporarily staying in a hotel. At 2 p.m. yesterday, he went to a gambling den at the Six Nations Hotel on Haig Road in western Shanghai alone. After a while, he won 200 yuan in national currency and happily left to return. He boarded a No. 70 tram's first-class car on Route 2 at Jing'an Temple, traveling from west to east. Unexpectedly, three bandits followed him closely, step by step. Two bandits sat to Wang's left and right in the car. When the car reached Seymour Road on Avenue Haig, one of the bandits took out a Mauser pistol and forced him to hand over the national currency. At first, Wang only gave 100 yuan. The bandits repeatedly said to be more sensible, that this wasn't enough, and hit his leg hard with the gun handle.

I was terrified and could not see the faces of the bandits, etc. When questioned by the defendants, the three lawyers Yan Songyao, Ji Gangpingfan, and Ni Guangzu argued that the defendants had discovered their conscience and released the victim and sent him home, asking for lenient treatment, etc. Judge Huang ruled that they would be returned to custody and the date of the verdict would be announced.

### Grain Prices: Speculators and Market Manipulators Run Rampant; Rice Prices Surge After a Brief Dip; Who Said Saigon Had No Deliveries... When Rice Arrives Daily Now?

Early morning trading of imported rice saw little interest from speculators. Supply lines appeared endless, and settling orders were easily announced. However, Chinese and foreign merchants were actively communicating via telegram, arranging for shipments from the production areas. It's expected that the supply of imported rice will gradually increase. Besides the recent arrival of a bulk shipment of 25,000 bags, smaller quantities continued to arrive. As a result, some of the speculators and foreign traders engaged in short-term speculation began to sell off their holdings. After the market opened, selling was brisk, and the black market premium for Xiaojiao rice (a type of rice) immediately dropped by 4,000 coins per hundred bags, reaching a low of 3,700 yuan. Saigon rice fell to as low as 3,300 yuan, and broken rice to 2,600 yuan. The market seemed to be trending towards stability. Unexpectedly, after the slight price drop, "market manipulators" and short-sellers seized the opportunity to buy low to cover their positions. Moreover, large speculators, unwilling to accept their losses, started to prop up prices again, causing the market to rise steadily. Xiaojiao rice rebounded from 3,800-3,900 yuan to 4,000-4,100 yuan. Annam glutinous rice, initially offered at 3,600 yuan, found little further demand. Saigon Number One rice reached 3,600 yuan again, and Number Two rose from 3,500 yuan to 3,800 yuan. Broken rice also climbed to 3,000 yuan, recovering 300-400 yuan from the morning's low. However, it was still about 2 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. Total transaction volume for the day was reported to be 14,000-15,000 bags.

Large quantities of imported rice continued to arrive. Two French ships arrived, directly carrying over 40,000 bags from Saigon, as previously reported. It's now known that the Eldorado, a ship managed by the Bao Long Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 10th) in the evening, also directly carrying over 18,000 bags from Saigon. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Yingzhou ship, carrying 12,143 bags from Hong Kong, docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to unload. Furthermore, the company's Qiongzhou ship arrived in port yesterday evening, also carrying imported rice. The quantity is still being investigated and will be reported later.

Yesterday, among domestic rice varieties, Bao rice saw weakening sales and was unable to sustain its price, falling by another 1-2 yuan. Early Qingjiaojiao rice was offered at 114.5 yuan and 114 yuan per dan (unit of measurement), while original-packaged rice was priced at 120 yuan. Thick Japonica rice, due to its broader distribution and firm quality, was more resilient. Sellers remained firm, and prices were stable. Regular grain stores offered premium Japonica rice at 127.5 yuan and 126 yuan per dan, while Kunshan rice offered high-quality Japonica rice at 124-125 yuan, down to 120 yuan. Original-packaged Zhongguan rice was priced at 125-126 yuan. Xiang rice saw little activity and minimal price fluctuations. Hong Kong special grade rice opened at 110 yuan, ordinary rice at 107-108 yuan, down to 104 yuan.

### Flour Market Gradually Weakening

Yesterday's flour market saw imported and domestically produced flour facing challenges. Although foreign-ordered flour wasn't arriving in Shanghai as scheduled, goods being transshipped from Hong Kong were steadily on their way. The market supply was increasing daily. Amidst the news of stable and weakening rice prices, speculators lacked the excitement for speculation. Australian Flower Bird Clock Tower brand flour, with recent arrivals being abundant, saw its market unable to sustain its price, falling back to 32 yuan. Evening trading was even more sluggish, with rumors of prices falling below the 32 yuan mark. Jinlong brand flour was at 31.1 yuan, down 5-6 jiao compared to the previous day. Factory-direct cheap flour from the Fuxin Factory remained at 25 yuan, with over 50 bags supplied, supplemented by imported flour to make up for any shortfall.

Wheat market conditions for both domestic and imported wheat were quiet with little supply or demand. High-quality wheat was priced at 45-46 yuan. Occasional small sales were quickly absorbed by a certain party. The Hua Factory saw little activity in either sales or purchases. The market remained stagnant as usual.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil and Corn Decline

Yesterday's soybean oil and corn markets continued their downward trend. Soybean oil fell by 2.5 yuan to 1.5 yuan. Transactions included 150 dan of factory oil, 70 barrels of Hankou oil, 50 barrels of Dalian oil, and 700 barrels of forward oil. Corn futures opened with 1,500 bags for immediate delivery and 600 tons for forward delivery (detailed prices are listed in the market price section). While the adverse weather conditions haven't yet cleared, the crisis hasn't been resolved. If speculators continue to ignore the warnings, they will eventually face the consequences of their actions.

500 tins of crude oil from Yantai were scheduled to arrive on the 30th.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Rates Unchanged

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates remaining stable. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies saw minimal fluctuations. After the morning opening, speculators rushed to sell, causing the U.S. dollar rate for this month to briefly become difficult to sell at 5.4375 yuan. However, British firms and banks with favorable exchange rates absorbed the supply and the rate softened. The British pound rate also faced difficulty settling at 3/125 of a tael due to a certain American bank buying it up. However, a telegram from Hong Kong announced sales, and the rate quickly stabilized. Around noon, speculators slightly increased their purchases, and banks were willing to supply, leading to a stagnant and stable U.S. dollar rate. In the afternoon, trading became even quieter, with the final British pound rate at 3/125 of a tael and the U.S. dollar rate at 5.40625 yuan, unchanged from the previous day's closing price.

Later, a British bank took a favorable position and bought U.S. dollars for March delivery from Chinese merchants at 5.4375 yuan. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax also saw no change. Afterwards, Chinese merchants covered their positions and bought U.S. dollars for April delivery at 5.40625 yuan from foreign firms. Subsequently, firms also settled accounts, leading to a slightly soft and stable market. At 11:00 a.m., a telegram suddenly arrived from Hong Kong, selling British currency for March delivery to a certain American bank at 3/125 of a tael. Also, there were rumors of a peace agreement with Japan. The bank subsequently started selling, selling U.S. dollars for March delivery to HSBC at 5.4375 yuan. The market situation subsequently stabilized and leveled out. At the closing, the exchange rates for both British and American currencies were the same as the opening rates.

Few Transactions Reported in the Aftermarket

### Gold Market Fluctuations Are Minor

Yesterday's speculative gold market was initially strong, briefly breaking through the 6,400 yuan mark, reaching a high of 6,420 yuan. This was due to competitive buying by two groups of securities firms in western Shanghai. Later, rumors of a peace agreement with Japan spread, and those who had speculated began to sell off. By noon, it had fallen back to the 6,400 yuan mark. The afternoon was uneventful, with a flat and weak trend. Money exchange firms like Shunyuan and Decheng resumed short selling, resulting in a final drop of 2 yuan. After the market closed, Dafeng sold off, but there were few buyers, resulting in a further small drop. Total trading volume for the day was 7,000-8,000 taels. For forward trading, sellers were willing to offer a premium of 40 yuan for the rollover from March to April, but there were no transactions. For immediate delivery, Xianghe (representing foreign firms) and Xiangxingyong (representing Chinese clients) were actively buying, accumulating a total of 800-900 taels at a price of 280 yuan. This was supplied by cash houses like Chengji, Yongfeng, and silver firms like Mingfeng.

Later, with the sudden pulling by securities firms like Defu, Tong Kangyong and Yida, and retail investors taking the opportunity to push up prices, although Xianghe and the exchange shorts supplied, once rose, reaching 6,420 yuan. Because the buyers' appetite turned sluggish, floating households took profits and sold off. Soon there were also Japanese peace news. Yida, Xiang and Yongheng Kee sold at a loss, dropping to 6,387 yuan. At noon, they had relied on Cheng Fei to stop the sale and buy up, and recovered to 6,410 yuan.

Last night, the association held a competition committee to discuss the results and decided to move the competition to the Public Concession.

Spring and Autumn

### After the Electricity Reduction

— Sima Jun

The factory director arrived at the office. A long, narrow envelope with an English letter was already on his desk. Fortunately, it had a Chinese translation inside.

The factory director frowned, rereading it repeatedly. In short, it was another electricity fee increase.

His mind was in turmoil, everything tightening around his thoughts, as if getting tighter and tighter. The goods had all been ordered, customers thronged the door every day, but the factory lacked 6,000 yuan of raw silk and over 3,000 yuan of rayon—practically nothing.

Although business was good, the supply route was cut off, racking his brains. Adding the electricity reduction made him restless.

He lit a cigarette, slumped on the sofa, and thought: "Originally, we used 20,000 units of electricity each month. After the reduction, it will be reduced to 70%, so we can only use 14,000 units. But what about the 6,000 units? Three times, three times!"

He seemed in great pain, taking a deep breath. "In short, expenses will increase again!"

Suddenly, he jumped up from the sofa and pressed the buzzer to the factory, pacing anxiously.

When the workshop supervisor walked into the office, the factory director politely wiped the sofa chair, "Please sit, sit!" He himself plopped down on the sofa and said to the workshop supervisor in a negotiating tone:

"The electricity reduction has been implemented. Our factory will use at least 6,000 units less per month. I was thinking, we can turn off more lights during the day. But the motors, I want to replace all the small motors with large ones. What do you think?"

The workshop supervisor did not expect such a sudden question. Thinking about the difficulties of converting to large motors in the factory, he replied:

"That won't work. Converting to large motors is dangerous, and the buildings and space aren't suitable. If we convert, the installation costs will be very high!"

The factory director felt like he had been splashed with a bucket of cold water, but, "We can save on electricity fees by converting to large motors!"

"Saving is certainly good, but all the prerequisites aren't there."

The factory director still didn't believe it. He picked up the phone and called the electrical consultant to come quickly.

After the electrical consultant arrived, the factory director accompanied him on an inspection of the factory. Back in the office, he asked, "How much would it cost to convert?"

"At least 30,000 yuan!"

The factory director clicked his tongue and shook his head. "That's terrible, so expensive!"

The electrical consultant said, "It's not expensive. It might go up in a few days!"

The factory director always felt that this huge expense wasn't worth it. Should he give up? But what about the unexpected triple cost of 6,000 units? Save, save, but there's no way to save 6,000 units!

That whole night, he didn't sleep. All kinds of "solutions" swirled in his brain, finally rolling out one. The next morning, he rushed to the office early, first rereading the electricity reduction letter. He called over the accountant: "Go draft a notice stating that due to the electricity reduction, the factory has no choice but to increase the price of all goods threefold, starting from the 20th of this month!"

"Didn't we just raise prices?" the accountant asked.

"Look, aren't the electricity fees tripling!"

In the afternoon, he urged the printing house to bring the printed materials. The accountant buried himself in checking addresses, customers, and writing envelopes. The factory director also stood by, urging the deliveryman:

"The letters must be delivered tonight. All new prices tomorrow!"

### Thoughts After Reading Mr. Yu's "Announcement"

— Qi Weide

Mr. Yu Qiaqing has gone to Hong Kong. Before leaving, he published a large announcement, detailing the sources and destinations of rice purchases and the profits and losses in a "list." Although the dates only go up to January 19th of this year, and the sales items include the names of "Shen Ji" and "Zhao Qingji," which still inevitably raise suspicions, the fact that he "was able to purchase as many as 200,000 dan of rice in a short period of time" is indeed "a drop in the bucket for Shanghai's food problem." Moreover, he had "advanced more than 10 million yuan beforehand" and "donated 349,884 yuan, 9 jiao, and 5 fen to the Sanbei Price Equalization Association's losses, and also donated 100,000 yuan to the Ningbo Price Equalization Association." He even "transferred" the net profit of 200,434 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen and "made up the shortfall!" Mr. Yu himself said that "sincerity has not been fully believed, resulting in damage in the pursuit of perfection," which really makes those who "do not understand the truth" "increase their shame!"

This "incident" is now, of course, a thing of the past. Mr. Yu's merits and demerits can also be clearly distinguished. However, the hidden worries about people's food have not been resolved by Mr. Yu's departure. On the contrary, they have become more serious, just as Mr. Yu said in his farewell message, "Continued supply still depends on everyone's support." However, even someone like Mr. Yu, who sought welfare for the city's four million people, still "suffered rumors." Then, how can those who are truly "not fully believed" bear this heavy burden?

However, it must also be said that in these difficult and challenging years, it is not the time to seek merits and demerits. As long as what is done is "reflecting on oneself and following the rules," and it is indeed for the welfare of society and the country, one can ignore slander and defamation and strive to do one's best. We hope that those who come later can emerge and take on this important task under this most commercial principle, so that Mr. Yu, who has left his "second hometown," can rest assured, and the common people will be fortunate!

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

(5) The Division Between Love and Lust

The letters and gifts were all sent out smoothly the next morning. At the same time, according to Zhao Si's report, the 100 yuan he promised to give to Ji Zhaoxiong was also brought to him. The recipient seemed very happy.

But one thing worried Begonia a lot, and that was Zhao Yukun's disappearance. According to the police station, he had been released yesterday afternoon, but Yukun had not returned to the Tianjin Hotel until the afternoon of the next day. Rong Kui and Begonia's pianist, Jin Dagezi, went out to look for him all night, going through all the small hotels nearby, but they couldn't find him.

"Could he have been done in by those hooligans?" Zhao Si asked, raising his fat face, revealing a strangely nervous look.

At that time, they were all in Ma Jinshou's room. This young man who sang male roles, who was actually less than 30 years old, looked as if he was an old man of sixty or seventy, because most of his time was spent on the opium couch. Because his title was a Tan School male singer, he had to be weird and perfect on stage. Smoking opium was a necessary condition!

"Don't worry about that! As long as they don't use weapons, one or two dozen hooligans aren't enough for the second boss to deal with!" Jin Dagezi leaned against the door frame, scratching his bald head with his right hand non-stop.

"A poisonous dragon can't fight a local snake. Don't underestimate them too much!" Zhao Si disagreed.

Begonia sat silently on Ma Jinshou's opium couch, not expressing any opinion. He knew that Zhao Yukun was not only physically strong and slippery, but also very quick-witted. Logically, he shouldn't have stumbled in front of those rascals. And in fact, it was indeed impossible to find him for the time being. It seemed that he could only wait until he returned to Beijing to talk about it. (60)

### Conserving Electricity · Daylight Saving

— CT work

### Appeal

— Juehui

In adverse circumstances, in inferior circumstances, truly wise people must have three conditions:

First, recognize the situation; second, understand the people's livelihood; third, understand the responsibility. Anyone who violates one of these three, regardless of whether they are high officials, well-known philanthropists, or important figures from all walks of life, must all be regarded as "enemies of the people"!

But recognizing the situation does not mean pretending to be a "hero"; understanding the people's livelihood does not mean habitually being perfunctory; and understanding responsibility does not mean using it as an excuse to shirk responsibility. Because we have already reached the point where "the map is unrolled and the dagger is revealed." Who is right and who is wrong, who is good and who is bad, who is complacent and who compromises, is clearer than a mirror a thousand times over!

Going back to the point, "the past is gone, the future can be pursued." It's "not too late" to pull back the runaway "wild horse" halfway. Otherwise, when a person is extremely hungry, they can do anything! (This is not a "threat," pay attention.)

### Making a Move

— Hufu

"A true gentleman does not speak when watching chess, and a great man never regrets a move." This is said to be the "personality" of a "gentleman" playing chess.

However, nowadays, the world is deteriorating, and the chess pieces for playing chess have been changed to the latest "substitutes"—called "whole bags of white rice"!

Therefore, white rice, which is of utmost importance to the people, has now been devalued and even used as a "toy" by a few people, manipulated on the chessboard.

Of course, moving bags of rice on the chessboard is a "laborious" game, but "gentlemen" can use "cranes" to do the work, and they only need to stand by and plan! Fortunately, "victory or defeat is common in war," and it has nothing to do with them!

Moreover, I heard that "immortals play chess endlessly." The friends watching the chess next to them, one by one, ran out of saliva and fell down, but the "immortals" laughed loudly and became more and more energetic! Fortunately, no one dares to break into the "White Tiger Hall" in the "Lingxiao Palace"!

So they simply grabbed the chess (rice) with one hand and held a knife in the other, strictly enforcing their "gentlemen's agreement"—"A true gentleman does not speak when watching chess," you bystanders don't speak anymore; otherwise, it will be "a great man never regrets a move," and the steel knife will fall with a snap, telling you to be sensible!

New Film Introduction

### "A Hundred Flowers in Bloom"

— Cheng Bingnu

Lucille Ball had great success in "Flying Down to Rio," so this film "A Hundred Flowers in Bloom," starring her, caught my attention. The original name of "A Hundred Flowers in Bloom" is Too Many Girls, which, like the Chinese translation, is quite business-minded. However, "too many women" doesn't seem to fit the plot. Although there are quite a few women in this film, one might even say that one man has ten women, Lucille Ball, as the protagonist of this film, has four men pursuing her at the same time.

It turns out that Lucille Ball is the daughter of a wealthy man, and she will inherit her father's huge assets. So her father hired four strong men to be her bodyguards, and as a result, she fell in love with one of them, Lee Carisson. This story is truly bizarre. I don't think even in the United States, where social circumstances are different from ours, such a thing would actually happen.

But aside from this far-fetched story, if "A Hundred Flowers in Bloom" has any "advantages," it is that it is lively, humorous, has songs, dances, and the irrepressible enthusiasm of young male and female students. However, as for the university that serves as the background of this film, if there hadn't been that football game, I would almost have suspected it was a "dance hall."

Speaking of song and dance, the director of this film undoubtedly put in his best effort. Several large scenes are handled very vigorously. The Rumba dance performed by Ann Miller and Desi Arnaz is beautiful and energetic, and it is the most "outstanding" part of this film. The large chorus of dozens of people is enthusiastic, unrestrained, majestic, and sonorous, and it is indeed moving. The protagonist Lucille Ball is consistently enchanting and charming. Although she doesn't have many scenes, she plays them quite humorously, especially the several stages in which she and the male protagonist, Lee Carisson, go from suspicion to love and from love to secret love, are depicted very delicately.

Although this film is a "giant structure" made by RKO Pictures, bringing together a large number of song and dance performers, in terms of interest, it seems to be inferior to the company's "Nana." This shows how necessary the script is for the form of the performance.

### The Philosophy of a Striving Life

The greatest enemy in life is boredom. Extraordinary talent is stolen by boredom, precious vitality is destroyed by boredom, full spirit is consumed by boredom, endless hope is killed by boredom, and physical health is destroyed by boredom. Boredom is truly the enemy of struggle—

Chapter 3 He Recalled Pingyuan's Appeal

Zhang Cangqiu said, "As long as it's not something with poison, I have good wound medicine in my luggage. I'll go back and apply some to Brother Xu later, and he'll recover soon." Li Xin looked at Zhang Cangqiu's heroic and bold appearance and found him very likable. He wanted Xu Jing and Zhang Cangqiu to come to his manor for a gathering immediately. Xu Jing, because there was no one at home, and the matter had come to an end, was eager to go back, so he promised Li Xin that he would invite Zhang Cangqiu to Li's Manor to visit him tomorrow. Li Xin then repeatedly urged Xu Jing not to break the appointment. Zhang Cangqiu also readily agreed, "I will definitely come to visit Lord Li tomorrow. We'll meet again." He then helped Xu Jing up with one hand, nodded to Li and Chen, and left. Li Xin also said, "Excuse me for not seeing you off. See you tomorrow." He returned with Chen Fei and the others. Zhang Cangqiu accompanied Xu Jing back to Xu's house. Xu Jing sat down in his room, and Zhang Cangqiu went to take out the wound medicine to apply to the affected area and re-bandaged it. Because it was almost five o'clock, they didn't talk much and went to sleep. The next day, everyone got up, and Zhang Cangqiu asked Xu Jing how his injury was. Xu Jing replied, "The pain stopped after applying the medicine, and it will heal soon." Zhang Cangqiu laughed and said, "Last night, although that Chen person made a wasted trip, he caused you to be injured for no reason. I'm really sorry." Xu Jing said, "It was my own carelessness that led to being ambushed, which has nothing to do with the strong man. The ancients said, 'Hiding wealth encourages theft.' Although we don't have gold, silver, or jewels, we have these knives, swords, and horses, which were seen by discerning people, so this happened. It's really unexpected." Zhang Cangqiu laughed and said, "Who exactly is that Li Xin? How do his retainers have people like chicken thieves? Xu Jing replied, "Li Xin is a martial arts graduate here. He likes to travel and has some knowledge of martial arts, like me. But he is independent and likes to socialize. Most people in the county know him. He and I are also friends, and we often go to his manor to play chess and chat. He has many followers, both civil and military. The Chen person who came last night also has very good martial arts. If Zhang Zhuangshi's skills were not superior to his, he would not have been so easily defeated. This shows that you are a hero, no wonder Li Xin wanted to invite you to his manor as soon as he met you." (17)

### Interesting Anecdotes from the Shanghai Charity Performance

— Xuanmeng

Although the Shanghai Society has a short history, it is always eager to help public welfare. Recently, it hired Mr. Yuan Ludeng as the president, and the society's affairs have made even more progress. The 16th of this month was the society's fourth charity rehearsal. All proceeds from the tickets will be used to relieve the rice famine in Ningbo. I was invited by the society to join the event. The program that day was very exciting. What I describe here are just one or two interesting anecdotes.

Old Uncle Praises Young Brother The young brother, Ye Gengliang, is the son of Society Director Ye Xianggao. That night, he performed "Phoenix Mountain". Mr. Yuan Ludeng was having dinner in the library on the third floor at the time. When he heard that the young brother was on stage, he ordered to move the table to the box, personally carrying his cup and chopsticks, and watched while drinking. Whenever the young brother finished shaking the clapperboard and singing or made a spear flourish, he gave him enthusiastic applause. So, everyone present said that the old uncle was praising the young brother greatly.

Huang Tianba Has Both Male and Female Roles On that day, two performances of Huang Tianba's play were performed. The daytime performance of "Falling Horse Lake" was performed by Mr. He; the evening performance of "Wrestling Ring Set" was performed by Miss Yu Ying. One male and one female. Isn't this having both male and female roles?

Yu Bei Pavilion Brothers Playing Instruments "Yu Bei Pavilion" is Mr. Li Shisun's masterpiece. His appearance is very beautiful, resembling Wan Hua in his early years. As for the singing and acting style, everything is excellent. The person playing the qin for Mr. Li is Xiao Dongyang, who used to follow Huang Yulin. The person playing the qin for Sun Junqing, the famous amateur singer, is Wang Ronggui. Xiao Dongyang and Wang Ronggui are blood brothers. Brothers playing instruments on stage, each showing their skills, is also a coincidence.

### Brief News

The Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Joint Association's Peking Opera Section, initiated by Mr. Shi Zhifu, Zhang Zehua, Zhong Xinren, and others, has been enthusiastically joined by those in the new pharmaceutical industry who love Peking Opera. It has been decided to hold the first public performance at the Ningbo Fellow Association on the 22nd of this month.
