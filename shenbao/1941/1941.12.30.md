Singapore, 29th (Havas) - The British Far East Command headquarters issued a battle report today stating that on the Malay front, the two armies have made contact south of Ipoh, the capital of Perak. There have been no changes in the war situation in other parts of Malaya. Several Japanese aircraft bombed and strafed positions along the southern coast of Kwantan. A report from Sarawak, North Borneo, confirms that Kuching, the state capital, has been occupied by Japanese forces.

Tokyo, 29th (Domei) - The Japanese Army General Headquarters announced at 5:35 PM today that the Japanese army in Malaya captured Ipoh, the capital of Perak State, yesterday afternoon. Japanese troops are advancing south.

Bangkok, 29th (Haitong) - Singapore news on Sunday night indicates that the Japanese army in southern Malaya has received reinforcements. Singapore believes that the main target of the Japanese army is Ipoh, so a major offensive towards Singapore has now begun. According to British reports, the Japanese army is now in Chemore, just ten miles from Ipoh. This area is located on the highway and railway line that runs through northern and southern Malaya. From Chemore, there are multiple small roads leading to Ipoh's tin mines.

Tokyo, 29th (Haitong) - Last night, authoritative sources here stated that after the Japanese army occupied the ports of Miri, Seria, and Labuan on the northern coast of Borneo, the oil production of British Borneo has completely fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. As a result, Japan's fuel situation has greatly improved, so the Japanese government has relaxed restrictions on gasoline. Trucks and coastal steamships have been granted gasoline, and Japan's transportation has greatly improved. Since the northern Borneo ports were occupied, Singapore's gasoline supply will depend entirely on Sumatra. After Penang Island and Victoria were lost, transporting oil from Burma to Singapore is also impossible. As for transporting oil from Sumatra to Singapore, it is also threatened by Japanese aircraft due to the new Japanese air base recently established on Penang Island.

### Little Change in the Battle Situation on the North and South Routes of the Philippines

Manila, 29th (Havas) - Regarding the fighting on Luzon Island, local officials did not issue a statement today. However, military authorities stated that the Japanese army's advance on the northern and southern parts of Luzon Island has slowed down. The Japanese army is now redeploying and preparing to launch a major battle in northern Luzon.

Manila, 29th (Havas) - This morning's battle report stated, "The advance of the American and Filipino forces is proceeding step by step, and there are no major battles in the north." It is also known here that fierce fighting has also broken out in southeastern Luzon. Organized destruction by Filipino forces has slowed the progress of the Japanese army in Lingayen Gulf. Furthermore, yesterday's bombing of Manila by Japanese aircraft resulted in only three injuries and no deaths.

Manila, 28th (Havas) - The U.S. Far East Command Headquarters recently issued a battle report stating, "The Japanese army is pressing towards us from southern Philippine Islands, and our army is bravely resisting. There are no fierce battles in the northern area." Furthermore, according to official announcements, fierce fighting is currently taking place near the city of Tayug, 140 miles north of Manila and 40 miles east of Lingayen Gulf. Over the past 48 hours, the city has been lost and regained no less than several times and is currently still under the control of the American and Filipino forces. The war situation in Pangasinan province is chaotic. According to the governor's report, the whereabouts of eight cities are unknown, "presumably having fallen into the hands of the Japanese army."

Lisbon, 28th (Domei) - According to Manila news, Japanese aircraft attacked Manila's port facilities and ships in the Pasig River twice this morning at 11:24 AM, lasting two hours. The damage is unknown, but it was heard that the area was still burning at 4:30 PM.

Bangkok, 29th (Haitong) - A report has been received stating that Cebu, the second largest city in the Philippines, was bombed by Japanese aircraft last Wednesday.

Washington, 29th (Havas) - Sources familiar with the situation here recently stated that government authorities have agreed on a plan that if the US military is forced to abandon Luzon Island, the Philippine government will relocate to Washington, D.C. This is not to say that the war in the Philippines has failed, but rather to prove that the Filipino people still wish to be in the position of a belligerent nation in the current war, willing to aid freedom and independence.

### Roosevelt's Assurance to Filipinos: Willing to Aid Freedom and Independence

Washington, 28th (United Press) (Relayed from Chongqing) - President Roosevelt delivered a radio address to the Philippines today, solemnly guaranteeing the restoration of the freedom of the Filipino people and the protection of their independence.

### Britain Decides to Do Everything to Defend the Gateway to India, New Commander Arrives in Burma to Take Office, Chinese Air Force Opens Up Burma to Assist in Defense

Delhi, 28th (Reuters) (Relayed from Chongqing) - A spokesman for the British Indian Army Headquarters stated today that the importance Britain attaches to Burma can be seen by General Wavell's willingness to appoint his Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Hutton, as the commander of the British army in Burma. We must hold Burma for two main reasons:

*   If the Japanese army gains a solid foothold in Burma, they will gain air bases with a range to attack most of India, as well as submarine bases that could attack shipping and ports in the Indian Ocean.
*   Burma is an important transportation hub, and the Burma Road is the main route for maintaining the supply of military supplies to China. The military spokesman continued that one of the tasks of General Wavell's trip to Chongqing was to discuss general issues related to the defense of Burma and maintaining traffic on the Burma Road. Major General Brett, commander of the US Army Air Forces, who accompanied Wavell to Chongqing, discussed US aid issues with the Chinese authorities. This issue is closely related to US aid to Burma's defense. U.S. aircraft and pilots are now playing an important role in defending Burma. Although Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed Rangoon, the losses have not been severe. After General Wavell assumed responsibility for Burma's defense, he is now responsible to the British government for the defense of a vast territory including Iraq, northern Iran, Ceylon, and Burma, and to the Indian government for the defense of India. The new commander of the British army in Burma, Lieutenant General Hutton, has arrived in Burma to take office.

Tokyo, 29th (Domei) - "Nichinichi Shimbun" today carried a Bangkok dispatch stating that the British have obtained the assistance of the Chongqing and U.S. Air Forces and two divisions of the Indian Army to strengthen the defenses of Singapore and Rangoon. Chinese pilots and American pilots are now concentrated in Rangoon and Toungoo flying ports. Another U.S. aircraft squadron has arrived in Singapore to assist in the protection. Indian troops are currently on their way to Singapore and Burma.

Tokyo, 29th (Haitong) - "Nichinichi Shimbun" received a dispatch from Bangkok stating that after Hong Kong was occupied by the Japanese army, the British headquarters' plan to rescue Singapore has entered a new phase. Although the British army is constantly reinforcing Malaya, whether Singapore can be preserved is still questionable. Britain is now planning to establish a second line of defense in Burma. A large number of troops are concentrated on the line from Rangoon to Mandalay. The city of Mandalay seems to be the fortress of the so-called "second line of defense in Asia." The newspaper also stated that according to the results of the Sino-British-American military conference held in Chongqing, Chongqing will send part of its air force to Burma to fight.

### U.S. Fleet Bides Its Time

Washington, 28th (Havas) - Many people wonder why the U.S. fleet is "standing still." Local naval strategists replied, "Wait patiently." The U.S. Navy has not abandoned its traditional offensive strategy and is waiting for the right opportunity to strike. The Japanese fleet has not concentrated on a large scale, but is only covering troop transport, and the United States is reducing the risk of major contact. This situation may continue for several months or even a year. In addition, the United States is unwilling to engage in major naval battles before its aircraft outnumber Japan's. Japan currently has many long-established air bases on the land, which is conducive to combat. The content is mainly to protect key locations. British Prime Minister Churchill and his entourage arrived in Canada.

### Roosevelt and Churchill Conclude Meetings, Allied War Plans Drafted, the Content is Mainly to Protect Key Locations, British Prime Minister Churchill and his Entourage Arrive in Canada

Washington, 29th (Havas) - According to official news, the 1942 Allied war plan is said to have been drafted. Its content is mainly to protect key locations. The so-called key locations are Singapore and Hawaii in the Pacific, Malta in the Mediterranean, Alexandria in Egypt, and the Moscow-Rostov line. Relying on these fortresses, the Allies can maintain a land front in Europe and maintain control of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and North Africa. In addition, although the safety of the Philippines is extremely important, it is considered unwise to transfer troops from Singapore to aid the Philippines.

Mexico City, 29th (Haitong) - Well-informed American sources revealed that Roosevelt and Churchill had agreed on a combat strategy during their meeting in Washington. The details are strictly kept secret. It is heard that the outline of the plan was drafted by American politicians, and its main purpose is to contain the Axis powers' forces until the democratic countries manufacture armaments and replenish their military equipment.

New York, 28th (Havas) - Regarding the issues discussed by British Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt, officials have not released any concrete information. However, according to local newspapers, the two either discussed unifying command in each dispute or studied "joint military action plans." For example, the New York Times stated, "Our country is not only at war with Japan, but we should not ignore some more urgent and important goals. The scope of our actions must be expanded to all theaters of war around the world and actively strive for the common goals of the anti-Axis countries. To achieve this goal, we must formulate joint plans for unified strategy. Every country must be prepared to sacrifice for the benefit of the whole. In the United States, even sacrificing the traditional pride of the American people is necessary."

Washington, 29th (Havas) - President Roosevelt held a meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill at the White House today, lasting 40 minutes. Ambassadors from South American countries were also present. Roosevelt and Churchill both gave speeches during the meeting, with the general meaning being the same, believing that they would be able to achieve final victory. However, the Allied war plan was not explained in detail. As for the ambassadors from the South American republics, with the exception of Colombia, Brazil, and Panama, all expressed their gratitude for Roosevelt and Churchill's invitation to the ambassadors of their countries to attend the meeting, and hoped that the various economic and military problems caused by the United States' entry into the war could be resolved at the Pan-American Conference to be held in the Brazilian capital on January 15 next year. Although, according to some diplomats, the Pan-American Conference can only make the Pan-American republics reiterate that they maintain relations between countries, only a few urgent issues should be discussed.

Washington, 28th (Havas) - How the world situation will evolve after the end of the current war has attracted the attention of political figures here, and some advocate the establishment of an international organization to carry out the tasks of the 1919 League of Nations. These people say that the United States cannot remain isolated and turn a blind eye to events in other parts of the world. International cooperation and collective efforts to maintain future peace are necessary. This is what former US President Wilson hoped for in 1918. At that time, he strongly advocated the principles of the League of Nations, with the League of Nations representing the ideals of the people of all countries and preventing war from happening again. In general, people also had high hopes for the League of Nations. However, the establishment of this international organization coincided with the rise of nationalism, and the United States' failure to recognize it was a fatal blow. For this reason, once the current war is over, everyone should understand that all countries after the war have countless orphans and widows, and it is urgent to recuperate. Therefore, the establishment of international organizations to maintain peace is necessary.

Ottawa, 29th (Havas) - Prime Minister Churchill left the United States for Canadian territory last night and is expected to arrive here at 10:00 AM this morning.

The Canadian War Cabinet is scheduled to hold a welcome meeting at the government offices at 11:30 AM. Then, Prime Minister King will host a luncheon for him at noon, and the Governor General of Canada will host a banquet in the evening. Prime Minister Churchill may meet with the press this afternoon and is scheduled to attend a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives at 3:00 PM tomorrow afternoon to deliver a speech. Japanese-Soviet relations remain unchanged.

Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Stafford Cripps, British Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Alexander Cadogan, British Deputy Chief of the General Staff General Nye, all participated in the meeting. The attitude of both parties was sincere, and full agreement has been reached on several key points, especially the complete defeat of Nazi Germany and the adoption of measures to prevent Germany from taking new military actions in the future. In addition, views were exchanged on the issue of postwar peace and security organizations, and some important information has been obtained, which will greatly facilitate the establishment of concrete proposals. Both parties also believe that this talk is an important step for the reconciliation between Britain and the Soviet Union.

Tokyo, 29th (Domei) - When Masaki Tani, a spokesman for the Japanese Information Bureau, entertained reporters today, he mentioned the Japanese-Soviet negotiations, predicting that a permanent fisheries agreement could be concluded.

Tani replied to another question saying that the current Japanese-Soviet relations are quite harmonious, and the Japanese side is very satisfied with this, and that the relations between the two countries are still based on the Neutrality Pact.

### President Roosevelt Convenes Supreme Military Conference, Brief Biographies of Five U.S. Army and Navy Commanders

Washington, 28th (Havas) - President Roosevelt met with leaders of the Army and Navy today for an hour. Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of the Army Stimson, Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, Air Force Chief of Staff General Arnold, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet Admiral King, and Director of Naval Plans Rear Admiral Turner all attended the meeting. However, no British representatives were present. It is heard that today's meeting was actually the highest military conference in the United States.

New York, 28th (Havas) - Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, there have been many changes in the command of the U.S. Army and Navy. Those currently responsible for combat include Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet Admiral Ernest King, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, Commander of the Asiatic Fleet Admiral [Blank], Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, and Commander of the Far East Command General MacArthur. The biographies of each person are briefly described as follows.

Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet Admiral Ernest King was born in Ohio, has served as captain of an aircraft carrier, and has special research on submarine warfare and various air force issues. Since future wars are based on the joint operations of the Navy and Air Force, Admiral King's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Fleet is extremely important.

Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark's primary task is to establish close contact between the government authorities and the Navy Department. In other words, he serves as a liaison between the people and the Navy and is directly responsible to the President of the United States. His only superior is the President of the United States. However, Admiral Stark is neither a naval admiral who formally commands the fleet nor a naval officer who serves on land. But according to naval tradition, he must often sail to participate in military affairs. In addition, the Admiral is a first-class administrative expert in the United States and has strong organizational skills.

Commander of the Asiatic Fleet Admiral [Blank], although he has reached retirement age, still holds the position of commander. The reason for this is probably because he is good at submarine warfare.

Army Chief of Staff General Marshall is a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute and did not attend West Point Military Academy. This is different from most U.S. Army generals. Marshall actively participated in the last World War. He also participated in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel in France and won glorious achievements.

Commander of the Far East Command General MacArthur is the son of a general and has served in the army since childhood.

### Checks for Electricity Bills Can Be Cashed Without Limit; Electric Power Industry Maintains Operations; Telephone, Water, and Gas Companies Enjoy the Same Convenience to Maintain Business

Industries in Shanghai, both British and American-owned, that rely on electricity for their operations can now withdraw funds from banks without limit to pay for electricity, thus ensuring the continued supply of power. This is the most important consequence of the announcement made by the Public Works Department last Saturday.

Check Cashing

The notice stipulates that all bank checks signed for services provided by the electricity company will be cashed by the respective banks. It is found that most of the important factories in Shanghai use electricity to operate, and the source of electricity largely depends on the Shanghai Electric Power Company. The electricity produced by the company accounts for 70% of the total electricity production in the city, of which 80% is supplied to the city's industries.

Difficulties Avoided

The Shanghai Electric Power Company is the largest industrial investment of American companies in China and has been taken over by the Japanese. Many difficulties have arisen in paying electricity bills. Now that the Public Works Department has announced that checks paid to the company will be cashed, these problems have been temporarily resolved. The other three public utilities that enjoy the same convenience are the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company, the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company, and the Shanghai Gas Company. The other two public utilities in the Public Concession, namely the British-owned Tramway Company and the Public Bus Company, receive income in cash, so they are not related to the Public Works Department's announcement.

### Shanghai-Hong Kong Shipping Planned to Resume

It is understood that shipping between Shanghai and Hong Kong has been interrupted for many days since the interruption. Now that the port has been occupied by the Japanese army, the shipping matters between Shanghai and Hong Kong urgently need to be restored. The authorities are planning to transport necessities such as rice and coal from Hong Kong to Shanghai to provide relief.

### Household Account Books; This Month's Family Account Book

The survey on the living conditions of Chinese white-collar families, organized by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Department, was originally scheduled for three months. It is heard that December of this year is the last month, and it will come to an end after the record is completed. The income and expenditure account book for this month is scheduled to be handed over by the accounting families to the staff at the counter of the nearby post office on January 2, 1942, to be returned to the bureau to avoid errors. The analysis of the account book is complicated, and the accounting families should return it on schedule to facilitate the process. The following points should also be noted: All items purchased but not used at the end of this month should be filled in Table 4 in the book to facilitate the calculation of consumption quantity within three months. Those who have not yet filled in Table 2 should fill in the dimensions of each room, the number of windows, and other items. All items of income and expenditure should be checked one by one to see if there are any duplicates or omissions. Whether the filling of the record book is in accordance with the regulations, and whether the questions in the record book are in accordance with the regulations. This record keeping makes a great contribution to the public, and it must be consistent from beginning to end to avoid failure. The Bureau expresses its deep gratitude for the efforts of the accounting families.

### This Month's Cost of Living Index Shows Both Increases and Decreases

For the past two and a half years, the cost of living index for Chinese workers in this city has been rising monthly. However, since the Public Works Department managed the prices of major commodities, general retail prices have stopped rising. The total index for December of this year is 1194.25 (1936 equals 100), a slight increase of 1.66% compared to last month. Among the sub-indices, only the food category increased slightly by 3.36%, while the rest decreased. In the first half of this month, the prices of major consumer goods, such as food, fuel, fish, meat, oil, and bean products, all rose, but then stabilized. The items used in the index, such as rice, flour, lard, vegetable oil, coal briquettes, etc., are all subject to management and limited sale prices. In the middle of this month, some items were in limited supply, and citizens had to purchase alternative products, which caused the price of sliced noodles to soar, once reaching 1 yuan and 62.5 cents per catty, but was later limited to 95 cents.

Western Residents' Commodity Index Slightly Decreases

Although the Pacific War has broken out, the cost of living index for Western white-collar workers in December has changed slightly. The overall index decreased slightly by 5%, which is because the Concession authorities manage prices for a wide range of foreign goods. The fourth and third price limit lists for canned goods were announced to supplement the shortcomings of the previous two lists. The price-limited items for foreign salaried class have reached 450 items, everything that should be there. The selling prices of coal, bread, and flour were also stipulated this month. Therefore, although shipping has been interrupted since the 8th and imported goods cannot be replenished, prices have been suppressed due to management. However, some of the things needed by foreign residents are no longer available, such as gasoline and cars. Supplies of things such as kerosene are insufficient. Now, taking October 1939 as the base period, the December composite index fell from 369.08 in the previous month to 367.127, which is due to the price limit on coal. The average selling price of Hongji lump coal per ton in November was 83.909 yuan, and it dropped to 664.17 yuan in December. Other sub-indices increased, with food increasing by 2.74%, clothing by 3.39%, and miscellaneous items by 0.76%, while fuel decreased by 14.28%.

They also filed a document requesting the authorities to serve as mediators. On the 16th of this month, representatives from both labor and capital were summoned to open up negotiations, but the opinions of both sides were at odds, resulting in a stalemate. It is reported that the authorities, in order to eliminate this dispute as soon as possible, have decided to summon the representatives of both sides, Cai Min, Xu Zhongshi, Ji Kuizhang, and Xu Zhixia, etc., again tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. for fair negotiations, in order to achieve a reasonable solution as soon as possible.

Shirt and Sock Dispute Under Investigation

It is reported that the authorities are sending personnel to investigate the business conditions and sales methods of each factory in order to start mediation.

### Severe Cold Lasts for Several Days; Corpses Litter the Roadsides; The Number of Deaths the Previous Night Reaches a New Record; Winter Relief Organizations Lack Adequate Resources

Due to the severe cold, homeless people in the two concessions, unable to withstand hunger and cold, died on the roads and in the alleys during the night. The total number on the previous night was 236, setting a new record for this winter. Some of the children's bodies were

Abandoned by Parents

Who were unable to bury them and abandoned them on the roadside. However, according to charity workers, the number of corpses on the road last night was unprecedented this year. There were 59 adult corpses and 88 children's corpses in the Public Concession, and 17 adult corpses and 32 children's corpses in the French Concession. The Public Concession found a total of 545 corpses on the road last week, including 353 children's corpses. The French Concession did not have a precise number of corpses found on the road last week, averaging 23 adult corpses and 48 children's corpses per day. The main reasons for the death of poor people

Is hunger, cold, and opium addiction, but most of the elderly and infirm have no such habits. Although winter relief from various charitable organizations in Shanghai has reduced the number of corpses on the road, the current scope of relief is inadequate. It is hoped that all sectors of society will, in this difficult time, uphold the spirit of compassion and jointly assist.

### Business News - Despite the Fall in Domestic Rice Prices, Rice Panic Remains

After a day of closure on Sunday, the supply of domestic rice saw an increase, totaling three to four hundred and thirty shih. Consequently, people's anxieties eased, and purchasing became smoother. Sellers had no choice but to lower prices to sell off their stock. In the morning, early-season rice was priced at 217 yuan, and thin rice at 220 to 215 yuan. However, due to a shortage of high-quality rice, especially Northern Japonica rice, it still opened at 265 yuan. Subsequently, due to a continued lack of inquiries, prices gradually declined, falling to as low as 215 yuan, eventually selling for only 212.5 yuan. Compared to the market price last week, it represents a sharp drop of over ten yuan. Throughout the day, over three hundred bags were displayed on the market, but less than three hundred bags were sold. Newly arrived Yuan rice and previously stored high-quality Jintan rice were priced at 228 to 225 yuan, but buyers only offered 210 yuan. This is because the production of pastries has been banned, significantly reducing consumption, unlike the peak winter season in previous years. Only about a hundred bags were sold. Although there were no formal transactions in foreign rice, it was reported that a few hundred bags of small glutinous rice and other foreign rice were sold off-market at a reduction of two to three yuan from previous prices. Furthermore, the arrival of domestic rice continues uninterrupted, and Wuhu rice can also continue to be supplied. Public sentiment in the market has indeed calmed down. However, regarding the sale of foreign rice, although the Japanese side has successively approved the opening of rice storage facilities, with as many as eight locations, the distribution to rice shops remains uneven. Therefore, the difficulties faced by ordinary people in buying small quantities of rice remain unresolved. It is sincerely hoped that the authorities, under proper management, will quickly plan for the widespread distribution of rice to various rice shops, so that ordinary people can buy rice more easily. In the Nanshi district, although there were further reports of large shipments of Wuhu superior rice arriving, it has not yet been seen being sold at fixed low prices. As a result, the residents of the urban area are already feeling a rice panic. If it is delayed for a few more days, food supplies will be exhausted. It is deeply hoped that the municipal authorities will quickly take remedial measures and open sales as soon as possible so that citizens can rest easy.

### All Edible Oil and Grains are Rising in Price

Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains continued to be strong. Due to the reduced availability of edible oil and soybeans, sellers persistently held firm, raising prices by three to five yuan. The continuous transportation of corn from the north also saw a rise of two to three yuan. Raw peanuts were scarce and subject to hoarding, with prices exceeding the 200 yuan mark. The overall market saw the sale of over a hundred barrels of Dalian soybean oil at a price of 377 yuan, and old barrels at 368.5 yuan. Twenty barrels of Qingdao raw oil were priced at 380 yuan, a hundred dan of Dasheng factory clear oil at 245 yuan, and two hundred dan of rapeseed oil at 270 to 272 yuan. A hundred dan of Dasheng factory rapeseed oil was priced at 270 yuan. Over a hundred bags of Tianjin New Jinyuan were priced at 104 to 105 yuan, and three hundred bags of green beans at 92 to 98 yuan. A cartload of Huangdou from Linhuaiguan was priced at 100 yuan, fifty bags of Chongming sand red beans at 87 to 88 yuan, five hundred bags of Dutch white corn at 50 to 50.05 yuan, over four hundred bags of yellow corn at 48 to 50 yuan, nearly a thousand bags of Saigon new corn at 50 to 51.5 yuan, and Dongzhan corn at 49 to 50.05 yuan. Also, over a hundred tons of Yinghua Company corn were priced at 86 to 88.2 yuan.

Bran, in this area, continues to be in high demand, but supplies are exhausted, and production is low. As a result, the market is gradually rebounding. Yesterday, four hundred bags of Lanhua bran were priced at 53 yuan, and two hundred bags of Sanxin bran at 56 yuan, which is said to be incrementally higher than previous market prices.

### Cash Price Surge

Ornamental Gold at 1300 yuan per tael

Yesterday, the black market for cash was fiery, and the upward trend intensified, with prices soaring beyond the 12,000 yuan mark. Amidst the intense buying pressure from a certain gold shop and silver shops from both local and foreign areas, the market price steadily rose. People's sentiments were firm. From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially rose to over 10,000 yuan. A certain money shop was first seen selling ten taels to a gold shop for 11,200 yuan. As gold shops continued to buy and silver shops continued to absorb, it rose another 600 yuan, reaching 11,800 yuan, which was sold by another gold shop and a Hong Kong group. At around 10:30 AM, it retreated to 11,500 yuan. Soon after, a certain gold shop resumed its search, and silver shops from both local and foreign areas competed to buy, with even some speculators joining in. The upward momentum grew even stronger, rising another 900 yuan, surpassing 12,000 yuan and reaching a high price of 12,400 yuan. Finally, with more speculators selling off, it fell back again, with the final price being 12,100 yuan, a sharp increase of 1,300 yuan compared to the final price last Saturday. It has risen for three consecutive days, a total increase of 2,600 yuan. The trading price on that day varied by as much as 1,200 yuan. With trading volumes exceeding a thousand taels, the selling price of ornamental gold per tael by Dashin and other firms rose three times, a total increase of 150 yuan, reaching 1,300 yuan (buying in was reduced by 200 yuan). Officially quoted silver was 16 yuan, while the black market price was 10 yuan with buyers, slightly firm.

Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange drafts and bills remained unchanged at five yuan per thousand, and the interbank lending rate of the money industry association was six percent.

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the price of US dollar notes continue to rise with the price of gold, reaching a high of seventeen yuan at one point. The final price was sixteen yuan and sixty-seven cents. Hong Kong notes were needed for three yuan, and military notes were quoted at three yuan and sixty-five cents.

### Cotton Yarn Attempted to Rise but was Thwarted After Profit-Taking

The cotton yarn market started high, then stabilized, and ended up remaining firm. This was because after the sharp fall in gold, it turned stable, so people's confidence turned for the better. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma factory singles continued to rise by 70 yuan, with the price being 1,920 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,925 yuan, but some profit-takers sold off, and it weakened again, closing at 1,865 yuan. However, the trading volume was about two to three hundred bales. The spot price of 20-count Tiannv was 2,300 bales, Shuangqiu was 1,725 yuan, Shuangma was 2,050 yuan, Lanfeng yarn was 2,400 to 2,375 bales (warehouse receipt), 42-count Feng was 3,850 to 3,780 yuan, and 16-count Hongkui Xing was 1,720 to 1,670 yuan.

The Dajing Exchange will resume operations next spring, and the Shuangma factory order was settled at the closing price of 2,190 yuan. It is currently in the process of liquidation.

It is heard that after discussions among the brokers of the Jin Shuangma futures yarn market, it has been decided that transactions made before the 8th will be settled at the closing market price of the 6th, as the standard for both parties to settle the price. The closing market prices for December are calculated as 2270.00, January as 2360.00, and February as 2440.00. However, there is still no definite news on when the market will open.

### Factory Cloth Slightly Active

The factory cloth market was stable yesterday, and wholesale business in this area was slightly active. Sixteen-pound Huadie coarse cloth was the firmest and most expensive, with spot prices opening at 100 yuan. Sixteen-pound coarse twill was 81 to 82 yuan, eleven-pound Yihé coarse cloth was 70.05 yuan, and nine-pound was 60 yuan, all fresher than last weekend. The price of Shilin blue cloth was also not loose. Only white greige fine cloth and fine twill sold the most quickly. Fugui fine cloth was quoted at around 80 yuan, with no transactions. About one hundred and several tens of pieces of dyed cloth, flannel, thread, tweed, and coarse cloth were traded in this area.

Eastern Cloth started high, then declined, and ended with a slight drop in fine cloth. Serge remained very firm. The opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth factory orders in the morning was shouted up to 81.5 yuan, but as spot goods were weak and buyers were scarce, it fell to 80.025 yuan. At closing, mid-range Caiqiu and Yanghe opened at 75-76 yuan, but also fell back to 75.25 yuan. Junzi Serge new warehouse receipts from October onwards traded at a high of 2.85 yuan and a low of 2.75 yuan, and rose again to 2.805 yuan at noon closing, up 0.005 yuan from last weekend. However, new orders issued before the end of September were considered old orders, so the market price had to be reduced by one to two cents per yard.

### Limited Transactions in Public Bonds

Off-market trading in public bonds has decreased, and transactions are quite limited. The market price rose and then fell. Class A bonds initially traded at slightly above 59 yuan, then at 59 yuan. Class C bonds initially traded at 56 yuan, then fell to 5.7 yuan, and then to 55 yuan, with the final sale at 4.9 yuan. Class E bonds traded at 54.2 to 54.3 yuan. The market price can be said to be roughly the same as last week. There is still no definite news about the formal opening of the market, but it is heard that industry insiders plan to start trading on January 5, but it is not known whether it can be realized.

Yesterday, in the off-market trading of stocks outside the stock exchange, Jardine Matheson was quoted at around 60 yuan. Ewo Yarns had no fixed market price, but a broker said that the price was about 20 yuan. One said it was only 23-24 yuan. The reclamation dropped to 21-22 yuan, and Langgezhe fell to the upper 8-9 yuan. There were no other prices.

### Empty Formalities

— Liaomou

In these times, it is extremely difficult for an individual to obtain the necessities of life to survive, to struggle and breathe, and to barely manage. But hardship is much better than not being able to survive. This is why even a three-foot-tall child in the ranks of the common people clenches his teeth and dares not leave his line.

But some fat-headed and big-eared people cannot be generalized. They seem to have no worries from birth. If you insist on lamenting the bitterness of the times to them, it will inevitably be very alienating. Their complexions are already very different, and their minds are also different. – However, they may not really be cynical; except for the playboy sons of rich families who are sprawled on cars with their hair combed back like a pompadour and don’t understand human feelings much, most of the smiling, round-faced people are more able to appreciate the ways of the world, and know more about the treachery of the world. – They have clawed their way up like that.

However, some successful people can "play the world" the most because of this. For example, let's take an example: they always do self-promotion – and the easiest way to do self-promotion is to send out invitations. Whether it is for a wedding or a funeral, they always understand etiquette. First, it shows that they have a rich status; second, they cannot help but sponge off people. Suddenly, they have a flash of inspiration, and they print thousands of invitations: "The ninetieth birthday of my late father", "The full-month celebration of my son." The latter requires energy; the former also expresses filial piety. People will definitely not come and check your family tree and ask you about the birth and death dates of your parents. If these two have already been done this year, it is okay to send out invitations for "My mother-in-law has become a widow" or "The birthday of my eldest uncle". If you have some background, you might as well write the names of the "People in Shanghai Who's Who" on the invitations. They will not dare not send a gift after hearing their famous names.

What season is it now? If you receive gifts, prepare a banquet for 100 yuan for Chinese food, and at least ten times that for Western food, plus beer and a red envelope. If you want to scrimp and save, each person only gets an "economical lunch box", as if it has never happened before. Therefore, if you are sponging off people, you still have to consider it; but if you are showing off your wealth, then blue cotton and white cotton, five hundred or a thousand, depending on the size of the event; and at the end, you publish an advertisement in the newspaper: "All the gifts received have been sent to charity organizations." You are happy to have people praise you for a while.

However, if they are nouveau riche, they will not relax their grip on poor relatives. Although this is different from sponging off people, the intention is the same as that of the Empress Dowager sending several kinds of pastries to poor princes via eunuchs. A red envelope is indispensable, and the gift must be decent. Although it is actually to show off.

The newest method is not to copy old articles: If you want to show your status, you book a table for 1,000 yuan, and apart from allocating part of the expenses to charity organizations, you will not accept a single penny of the gift. In addition, you give one or two commemorative gifts, so that they can leave full of gifts. – This is the way to show off your wealth.

This seems to be making it difficult for all the guests to be refugees. But with the promotion of this, once this trend starts, the beneficiaries will definitely cheer and praise endlessly.

In summary, it seems to have the suspicion of Feng Xuan burning bonds for Lord Mengchang; however, people will always want to be in the limelight like that, and one day "defaulting on debts is not as good as defaulting on favors", and poor relatives will automatically default. There is no way to come to the door and demand.

But if: if parents die and are buried, and you are getting married, relatives and friends may have the pain of frowning at these empty formalities, but they will have to deal with them in order to be worldly and human. The Book of Rites says: "If you have made laws that benefit the people, you should be sacrificed to; if you have worked hard and died in your duty, you should be sacrificed to; if you have worked hard to stabilize the country, you should be sacrificed to; if you can resist great disasters, you should be sacrificed to; if you can defend against great disasters, you should be sacrificed to." Amitabha!

### It Can't Be Done, Brother

— Wuwei

Taking a car is not a casual matter. Look at the trams that are "affordable, stable, fast, and cheap for the masses." Except for the occasional one or two fixed cars that drag empty shells on the tracks and gallop in the middle of the night or at dawn, they are really like a newly bought box of matches. The end full of match heads cannot be easily opened without some effort. Therefore, waiting for a tram requires patience, and getting on a tram requires strength. The so-called "masses" seems to have left aside the old, weak, women, and children. As for the repeated increase in fares, it is a bit like "a line of white egrets flying up to the blue sky" away from the word "cheap", and it is getting farther and farther away.

The situation of the cake-style double-decker buses is similar to that of trams. Sometimes they sway, as if riding a bad horse, and there is a general idea of ​​"eliminating hundreds of diseases with seven back-stretches" on the eight-section brocade exercise. People who are not physically and mentally sound should not think of not feeling dizzy.

Of course, taking a car is the most comfortable. However, how easy is it? Private cars are only for the wealthy; when hiring a car, before the fence was built at the Xiang Sheng intersection, it had already risen to ten yuan every twenty minutes (including tips). If you go back and forth twice a day, you have to spend six hundred yuan a month, and a person cannot move. Cars, cars, it is really not easy to talk about!

Let's go back to nature and use other people's legs instead of our own. The only way out is the rickshaw. Whether it is a strong man who walks like the wind or an old rickshaw puller, it is really a headache to bargain with them. If you encounter rain, maybe you will not be able to get a ride, and you will first hurt each other's feelings.

All in all, taking a car is a trivial matter, but after careful study, there are really many troubles. It is better to ask for oneself than to ask for others. Of course, it is best to walk on foot. But after thinking carefully, there are also imperfections. If the weather is sunny and you stroll leisurely on the less crowded roads, you will not feel tired even if you walk five or six miles. Like these days, the northwest wind blows on your face, and you squeeze and push on the sidewalk, and the taste is also lacking. If you wear leather shoes every day and walk on cobblestone roads, you are desperately making things difficult for the soles of your shoes. According to the market price of more than one hundred yuan a pair of leather shoes, running for a year will also be a considerable expense. Only people with a few sets of old suits do not even have the opportunity to wear cloth-soled shoes.

There is no point in talking about taking a horse-drawn carriage, and riding a bicycle also requires many conditions. So what is the best thing to do? It can't be done, brother!

### One Five Dad, Let's Go Busking!

"What? You dare to let them go!" Just as the man surnamed Han was thanking the young man, the little fat man inside had already discovered it and shouted loudly.

"Don't worry, everything is on us!" As soon as the young man heard this, he hurriedly turned around and answered in a rather strong tone: "Whoever wants to go to the police station, we'll go right away!..."

Mei Bao supported her father and hurried out of the lane. While doing so, she was still carefully listening to the argument between the two sides in the room. She didn't know why, but she felt very uneasy. She worried that the three guests who had helped them would clash with the pair of drunkards, especially the youngest student-like person. She couldn't bear to see him suffer. But at this time, she first had to accompany her father away from this trouble, and of course she couldn't go back alone.

"We really owe a debt of gratitude to those three guests today!" As soon as she got to the street, Miss Han expressed her gratitude to Qiu Haitang and Mei Bao.

Qiu Haitang just remained silent.

"I hope we haven't implicated them!" Mei Bao replied in a very low voice. She seemed to see the head of the student-like young man being smashed by a vegetable pot thrown by the little fat man. (291)

### We Were Cheated

— Shicheng

My brother-in-law is a businessman in Hong Kong. This time, when the war broke out, our whole family – especially my sister – were very worried about him.

The day before yesterday morning, a cunning swindler took advantage of this opportunity to visit our home. He introduced himself and said: "I just came from Kowloon. Mr. Chen (referring to my brother-in-law) has escaped to Kowloon. On the night of the ship's departure, he entrusted me to tell you in Shanghai that if there is a way, he wants to return to Shanghai immediately." After hearing this, we were all very anxious. He paused for a while and continued: "If you want to return to Shanghai from Kowloon, I have a way, but you must first register in Shanghai." When we heard the words "have a way", we were all very happy and hurriedly asked him about the registration procedures. He replied: "To register in Shanghai, you need a handling fee of 100 yuan. After registration, I can hide Mr. Chen in my ship, and he can return to Shanghai in five or six days." We were driven by the hope of "brother-in-law's return" and scraped together 200 yuan and gave it to the man who claimed to have come from Kowloon, and said many words of thanks to him. He took the money and said to us: "I can give you an answer in two hours. I will go to register immediately."

Now it has been dozens of two hours, and the swindler has never returned.

### A Chronicle of Major Events in the Art World Over the Past Year (Part 1)

— Jingyi

Another year has passed in a hurry. As usual, at this time of transition between the old and the new, there must be a summary in all aspects. In the art world, we may as well liquidate it as well. This year, there have indeed been many new changes. The following is a record of several major events in the film and drama fields:

(A) Active Small-Scale Companies - The only formal film production companies in this city after the war were "Guolian", "Guohua", and "Yihua". Although two or three companies such as "Minhua" and "Golden Star" have emerged since then, small-scale companies have sprung up like mushrooms after rain this year. Although they cannot develop to the fullest extent due to the restrictions of capital and studio locations, they can all produce one or two works by burying themselves in hard work. As far as the author knows, there are "Dafeng", "Danian", "Dacheng", "Datong", "Huanian", "Meicheng", "Lianxing", "Huayi", "Lianyi", and others.

(B) Guolian's Blockbuster "Home" - Guolian mobilized huge capital and cooperated to produce the film adaptation of Ba Jin's famous literary work "Home". This gathered the top stars and directors of the entire film industry. After more than a year of manpower and material resources, it was finally completed and released this fall. The highest seat price was sold for eight yuan, which is indeed an unprecedented initiative in the Chinese film industry and left a glorious page in film history.

(C) The Rise of Horror Films - There was a horror film "Midnight Song" before the war, which once shocked the silver screen, but this type of film has rarely been found since. However, this year, due to the enthusiastic love of a large number of viewers for horror drama materials, horror films have emerged in response to the trend, accounting for three-tenths of the total output. Things like ghosts and zombies are everywhere, and most of them are crudely made and not worth watching. As of now, there are still many in production. This can be said to be a similarly distorted development as the costume folk lightning movies at that time.

(D) The Great Shanghai Cinema Changes to Screen Domestic Films - The Great Shanghai Cinema is one of the largest cinemas in the city. After opening in 1931, it specialized in screening foreign films. This summer, Yu Qiaqing invested in taking over the cinema and entrusted Zhang Shankun and Sheng Pihua to organize the Wood Company to operate the cinema's business, and it was changed to specialize in screening first-run domestic films. It grandly opened on September 24 this year. From then on, domestic film theaters also had great buildings, so that foreign film theaters were no longer exclusively beautiful.

### Blood Rain and Precious Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 20 - Welcoming Candles on the Battlefield

Xu Jingdao said, "Second Brother, do you think that General Wu, having obtained Yuanyuan, will devote himself to the country after his private affairs are over? Alas! I see General Wu will henceforth be in the gilded tent, enjoying the pleasure of flying, learning the legacy of painting eyebrows on the embroidered jade building. The country's affairs are not in his heart at all!" Liu Yinying smiled slightly. Zhang Cangqiu and others, when they first heard this news, thought that Wu Sangui might want to return to Beijing to negotiate with the Regent Prince in order to convene the remaining old ministers and discuss how to continue to establish the Ming Emperor. Therefore, they still had a glimmer of hope for Wu Sangui in the midst of disappointment, and they happily returned to Beijing with the army. It happened that the Regent Prince was hanging plain silk and announcing to the officials and people that he was mourning for the Ming Dynasty empress and empress. Sangui was a Ming minister, so of course he had to go to the palace to pay his respects. The Regent Prince was very surprised to see him back and treated him very favorably. That night, he held a banquet to entertain Sangui, with the princes accompanying him. When the wine was drunk, the Regent Prince dismissed the attendants and talked secretly with Wu Sangui for a long time. After Wu Sangui resigned, the next day he swept away his old residence and planned to hide his beauty in a golden house to settle Yuanyuan. He also ordered his confidants such as Ma Bao, Bai Xianzong, and Chai Ying to enter and meet him, and talked to each of them privately for a few words. He also distributed surplus silver to reward the three armies. The next day, he claimed to be ill and did not go out, and there was no movement for three days in a row. The generals also held banquets and meetings, and their state was leisurely, and they never mentioned state affairs. Zhang Cangqiu and others were a little impatient again. One day, four people gathered in Zhang Cangqiu's barracks to talk. Zhang Cangqiu sighed first and said, "Although we four brothers followed General Wu to establish military merits and seek an official position, we also wanted to avenge the imperial court and stabilize the country. How did we know that we would only create opportunities for others? I asked garrison commander Ma. He also hesitated and was unwilling to say it directly." Chen Fei said, "General Wu has obtained Yuanyuan and is lost in the gentle countryside, and has no great ambitions. In my opinion, he is also powerless." (252)
