### Great Naval Powers of Britain and the United States, Jointly Defending the Far Eastern Outpost: Britain Announces Minefield Boundaries off Singapore, Enhancing Naval and Air Bases to Block Japanese Southern Advance

London – The British Admiralty announced that after laying mines in the sea off the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait, ships wishing to pass through the area must request routes from the British naval authorities. The boundaries of the minefield are: north latitude 02°44' north, east longitude 04°30' east, south latitude 01°35' north, and west to the Malay coast. (Reuters, 17th)

London – Unofficial sources analyzed the Admiralty's statement yesterday, stating that the laying of mines in the southeastern region of the Malay Peninsula effectively blocks the main routes from Thailand, China, Vietnam, and Japan to Singapore. It is believed here that this measure further enhances the naval and air bases there. It is also believed that this action is an attempt to ease the tense situation this week caused by Japan's potential southern advance following Germany's spring offensive. The impregnable stronghold of Singapore has recently been reinforced by squadrons of Royal Air Force Blenheim bombers and Australian bombers. Observers believe that the arrival of the British Far East Commander-in-Chief, Brooke-Popham, in Australia also indicates further cooperation between the British Empire and Australia to defend Britain's Far Eastern outpost. It is recognized here that there is also an indirectly important point regarding the Far Eastern situation, namely that Japan is reportedly negotiating with Thailand and Vietnam to obtain air bases in those two places. However, public panic has been somewhat alleviated by the Anglo-Thai non-aggression treaty and the Thai government's announcement that "excellent relations" with Britain "have not been damaged." British commentators predict that if Japan takes any action against Singapore, Britain and the United States will inevitably cooperate to deal with it. The Sunday Times stated that the world's two largest naval powers, Britain and the United States, will stand on the same line to defend Malaya and resist Japanese aggression. The newspaper also stated that Japan may dream that the British navy is unable to look eastward and the American navy may not participate. If so, Japan will have its beautiful dream suddenly shattered one day. (United Press, 17th)

Sydney – Australian Attorney-General and Minister for the Navy, Hughes, stated in a broadcast last night that although the situation is serious, he sees nothing that should cause the resolute Australian people to panic. Australians who heard the joint statement issued last week by the acting Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition felt uneasy and even somewhat apprehensive. In fact, this situation will pass. Foreign Minister Spender also delivered a speech stating that if we do not recognize the reality of the current situation, we will be deceived. There is a country that disregards traditional customs and past friendships. Even in terms of mutual relations and geographical connections, it should coexist harmoniously with us, but it has actually formed a military alliance with Australia's enemy. This is truly unfortunate. (Reuters, 17th)

Manila – Dr. Huang, a former senior official of the Chinese Ministry of Finance, declared today that the crisis in the Far East is linked to the situation in Europe. Regardless of what action Japan takes, the outcome will depend on the development of the European front. Dr. Huang arrived here from Hong Kong on the President Coolidge. He stated that Japan will not dare to participate in the Pacific war unless it feels it has a good chance of winning. Therefore, Japan is waiting for an opportunity to allow the European situation to become clear and definitely advantageous to the Axis powers. Dr. Huang stated that the situation in Hong Kong is very safe and it is prepared to deal with any unexpected events. Mines have been laid in the harbor to prevent unforeseen circumstances.

Japanese Actively Preparing to Advance Southward: Warships and Aircraft Concentrated on Hainan Island

Chongqing – This morning, all Chinese newspapers published news of Britain laying mines in the Singapore Strait and ordering the evacuation of British expatriates from Thailand in large characters. The Central Daily News reported that Japan is currently actively preparing to advance southward. The Japanese troops in Haiphong and Hanoi have been strengthened. Eleven warships from the Japanese Second Fleet have reportedly been transferred from Shanghai to Hainan Island. At the same time, the Japanese Second Fleet has reportedly also arrived at the island. At present, the number of Japanese warships concentrated near Hainan exceeds fifty, and more than two hundred aircraft have also been transferred from other parts of China to the island. The Saodangbao (Sweep Away Newspaper) stated that Japan has not yet completed preparations for actions in the South Pacific. Japan is concentrating ten divisions for use in actions in the South Pacific, but so far only a few divisions have been concentrated in various bases in the South China Sea. Moreover, Japan is still waiting for the completion of negotiations with Vietnam and Thailand to obtain bases, and believes that Japan is also awaiting the conclusion of German-French negotiations. (Reuters, 17th)

Chongqing – The Central Daily News reported that the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense, and all countries concerned about the development of the Pacific are filled with anticipation. The eyes of the world are focused on Japan, wondering what its next move will be. According to the Japanese southern advance program, it did not begin today, but actually started on February 10, 1939, when Japanese troops occupied Hainan Island. Chiang Kai-shek called it "the September 18th Incident in the Pacific." Japan completed the construction of naval, land, and air forces on the island. At the same time, Japan is now in a position to control the South China Sea because of its agreement with Vietnam and its participation in the Vietnam-Thai disputes. We must solemnly declare that the stability of the Pacific situation is an essential factor for the United States and Britain. Therefore, we all believe that American aid to Britain should not be limited to the British Isles, but should pay the same attention to Singapore. Currently, the Japanese troops concentrated in the South Pacific are partly gathered in Hainan Island, Guangzhou, Zhou Island, the Xisha Islands, the Spratly Islands, and Vietnam. The troops stationed in Guangzhou are units of the 18th, 14th, and 38th Divisions. The troops stationed in Hainan Island are units of the Konoe Division, the 28th, and the 11th Divisions. The troops stationed in Hanoi and Haiphong include the Konoe Division and units of the 28th Division. The above troops are all under the command of the Japanese Southern China Army Headquarters, and part of them will be used to finally occupy Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay. Currently, there are four divisions of Japanese troops concentrated in Taiwan, two of which are newly formed, one division was transferred from Manchuria in October last year, and the 5th Division was transferred from Guangxi in November last year and was reorganized in early January. The divisions stationed in Taiwan are not commanded by the Southern China Army Headquarters, but directly obey the orders of the Tokyo General Staff Headquarters. (Reuters, 16th)

Thailand Denies Negotiating with Japan, Says It Will Remain Outside Disputes

Bangkok – Thai radio officials stated that foreign radio broadcasts that Thailand is currently negotiating with Japan to allow Japan to use Thai naval bases to attack Singapore are completely untrue. Japan has never mentioned this matter in talks with Thailand. The Thai government believes that regarding the tension in the Far East and rumors that Thailand will be dragged into the war, there has been no development that would involve Thailand in any possible conflict. It hopes that the general public will remain calm and not be disturbed, and will continue to perform their duties as usual. The Thai government, based on the country's construction program, strives to maintain safety and honor. The Thai government also assures the public that the government will make its best efforts to keep the country out of any international disputes. (Reuters, 16th)

London – As a precaution, the authorities have advised British women and children residing in Thailand to leave the country. (Reuters, 17th)

Bangkok – British expatriates here will hold a meeting at the British Embassy today to discuss the British Embassy's advice for British women and children to evacuate as soon as possible, and embassy staff will also explain the meaning of the notice. (United Press, 17th)

London – The Daily Telegraph's editorial today stated that the authorities' advice for British expatriates in Thailand to leave the country should be seen as a prudent precaution, not as clear evidence that danger is imminent. We should remember that when Hitler boasted of the total number of people under the Axis powers, representatives from the eastern and southern parts of the British Empire were gathering in Delhi. The representatives represented a population of 441.6 million people and an annual trade volume of 1.3 billion pounds sterling. Their undeveloped war power is truly formidable. Their geographical location allows them to distribute increasingly powerful forces to the most urgent places to protect the security of the Empire. Australia alone has the power to destroy the Nazi Japanese threat to the south, because Australia not only has soldiers of the best quality, but also has a good industry to back them up. Now the entire people are engaged in a great production plan. However, Australia is only one of the imperial arsenals that can supply munitions needed in the Pacific war. The article mentioned the industrial resources of India and South Africa, and also stated that the Japanese government may have a glimpse of the richness of this power. There should still be sufficient wisdom in the East Asian Conference to reject Hitler's theory of national suicide. (Reuters, 17th)

Ohashi Responds to Questions from Parliamentarians: Need to Seek Understanding Overseas

Tokyo – Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi, in response to a question from a parliamentarian in the House of Representatives Audit Committee today, confirmed that negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia are about to reopen. He continued that there is a clear tendency for various countries to express unwarranted fear of Japan. This situation is caused by Britain spreading rumors that Japan intends to immediately begin its southern advance. He believes that the recent meeting between US Secretary of State Hull and the British, Australian, and Dutch envoys in Washington was prompted by this development. However, if there is any attempt to bind Japan by spreading such false news, we will have to reject it. At that time, the serious consequences may be difficult to avoid. Therefore, in the current extremely delicate international situation, it is necessary not only to seek understanding overseas, but also to find ways to prevent any unexpected developments at home. Although our interests in Hainan are a matter of life and death, the use of force will cause destruction and have adverse effects on Japan. The Japanese government's policy is to seek a solution through peaceful negotiations to the end. (Reuters, 17th)

Tokyo – Tokyo Japanese newspapers today published a large-character dispatch from Washington, describing the situation of the meeting between the Secretary of State and the British, American, Australian, and Dutch embassies last Saturday. However, most newspapers did not comment on the situation. After Hull met with the Dutch envoy to Washington, Loudon, he issued a public statement stating that the Dutch East Indies will "resist aggression." The Yomiuri Shimbun titled the Washington situation "Discussions on Joint Anti-Japanese Demonstration Focused on the Dutch East Indies Issue." (United Press, 17th)

### First Batch of US Army Families Leave the Philippines

Manila – The first batch of sixty-seven family members of US military personnel returned to the United States today on the US military transport ship, USS Guayto. More family members of US military personnel will return to the United States on the transport ship USS Grant in the near future. Two more transport ships will arrive here to help the US military evacuate family members. Reliable sources say that six US transport ships have now set sail for the Philippines, carrying reserve officers and supplies. It is believed that the six ships will also be used to evacuate the family members of US military personnel here when they return to the United States. (United Press, 17th)

### US Lend-Lease Act to be Passed by the Senate: Office of Production Management Established, US to Become Arsenal of Democracy

Washington – After returning from Britain last night, Hopkins, the Senate began its final debate on the Lend-Lease Act today. After President Roosevelt listened to Hopkins' direct report on the European situation, the bill began to enter its final stage. Hopkins stayed in Britain for a month and returned to say that Britain can certainly win if it can obtain sufficient assistance from the United States. He also spoke about whether his report would be published publicly in order to influence Congress. Supporters of the Lend-Lease Act began to act today in an attempt to obtain legislative passage, and have delegated Georgia Democratic Senator George, Kentucky Democratic Senator Barkley, and Vermont Republican Senator Austin. Opponents have also prepared to counterattack, and have summoned the best speakers to appear tomorrow. At the same time, Montana Democratic Senator Wheeler, who supports President Roosevelt supplying Britain with food and munitions, said that this move is intended to gain the support of farmers. (United Press, 17th)

Washington – The final stages of the Lend-Lease Act will begin in the Senate today. The opposition also knows that the passage of this bill cannot be avoided, but is still determined to reduce the various powers granted to the President. The government expects that the Senate can pass the bill within ten days. (United Press, 17th)

Washington – The highest new national defense agency has begun to exercise the power of making the United States the world's largest arsenal to defend democracy and free production management. The Office of Production Management has been established by executive order. President Roosevelt signed the appointment of the four members of the office on January 7: industrialist Knudsen, labor leader Hillman, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of the Navy Knox. In the coming months, the three letters OPM (the abbreviation of Office of Production Management) will be as important as the early NRA (the abbreviation of National Recovery Administration) and familiar to the general public. The NRA was a method by which the President hoped to break the economic downturn, while the OPM wanted to accelerate military production so that Britain could defeat Germany. Since President Wilson appointed Baruch as the director of the Military Industries Bureau in the last war, the strict control of the national economy by the British federal government has not been greater than this time. In this crisis, it is the first time that the task of domestic rearmament has been entrusted to a small organization. The scope of the OPM's operations in accordance with the broad powers granted to the President can be seen from the statement issued by the four members. The following is part of the statement: "If we want to make the manufacture of American arms sufficient to defend democracy and freedom, then we must have the active, enthusiastic, and sincere cooperation of men and women, young and old, throughout the country. In this way, only the needs of national defense can outweigh everything else in the near future. For management, industry must place its business under the possible effects of immediate and massive expansion. Attempts at wartime profiteering must be strictly prohibited. For workers, the workers' loyalty and intelligent cooperation are essential. Workers must not improperly use their position in the current world crisis. Collective bargaining and workers' rights have been challenged. For management and workers, if the totalitarian countries of the world win, capital and labor will become the unfree appendages of the almighty nation." In fact, the responsibility for transforming the American peacetime economy into a wartime emergency economic system has been borne by one mastermind. The names of this mastermind are Knudsen and Hillman. Knudsen, formerly a senior executive of General Motors, immigrated to the United States from Denmark at the age of twenty and worked in a New York shipyard. He has been the chairman of the National Defense Advisory Commission since June last year. Hillman also came to the United States from Lithuania at the age of twenty and later became a leader in the cloth industry. He was very active. Before serving on the National Defense Advisory Commission, he served as the chairman of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The home countries of the two men are all victims of the current European war. Denmark has been protected by Germany, and Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union after the Soviet-Finnish War. Knudsen is now the President of the Office of Production Management, and Hillman is the Vice President. Stimson and Knox participate in the decision-making and inspection work of the Office of Production Management. Under the Office of Production Management, there are three subgroups. One is the Production Group, headed by Biggers, Knudsen's assistant on the National Defense Committee. The second is the Procurement Group, headed by Nelson, who is responsible for procurement on the National Defense Committee. The third is the Priority Group, headed by Stettinius, who is the director of raw materials for the National Defense Committee. The power granted to the President by Congress to promote national defense preparations has been transferred by the President to the Office of Production Management by executive order. This power includes the power to allow industries to prioritize obtaining tools and raw materials or goods, and the power to take over industries that oppose national defense construction. Priority orders will be determined by the Priority Group headed by Stettinius and signed by Knudsen and Hillman. Knudsen and Hillman are also ex officio members of the Priority Group. Other members are Nelson and Henderson. There is one more member who has not yet been announced, and it will probably be Biggers. (United Press, 16th)

Editorial

### The Alleged Sino-British Military Secret Agreement

On December 9th of last year, the Chinese National Government and the British Embassy in Chongqing issued official statements to firmly deny the news spread by the Japanese that the British Ambassador in Chongqing was negotiating a secret military agreement with the Chinese government. More than two months later, Tokyo once again spread the same news a few days ago. It was claimed that the military agreement being negotiated between China and Britain was an attempt to maintain British influence in the Far East and prevent Japan from advancing south. The content of the agreement would include the Chinese government forming a joint defense line with Singapore to counter Japan's southern advance, and increasing the supply of American military equipment to China via the Yunnan-Burma Road. As of the time the reporter chose this topic, the Chinese and British authorities had not been heard to deny this news; therefore, outsiders have no way to guess whether the news is credible or entirely fictitious. Regardless of whether the news is true or false, and regardless of whether the Chinese and British authorities deny, remain silent, acknowledge, or ignore this news, there are points worth commenting on.

In the past two or three months, there have been no concrete changes in the international situation sufficient to shock the world, but gradual evolution has been progressing daily. Looking back on the international atmosphere of early December last year, it can be said that the present is no longer what it used to be: the confrontation between Britain and Germany in the English Channel has been in a long-term stalemate, and Britain has become more stable, while the battle situation on both sides of the Mediterranean is deteriorating for Italy and it is almost unable to cope; China has broken the Japanese large-scale offensive in the Henan area; Japan's southern advance activities are engaged in blatant struggle layouts in military, political, diplomatic and economic aspects; the United States has successively elaborated on the inevitable actions of the United States through Secretary of State Hull and President Roosevelt, and the Mutual Aid Act has also broken through several difficulties and will enter the implementation stage; these situations are continuing to push forward, making people who pay close attention to the news not feel the gradual changes in the situation, just like people who meet every day neglect each other's gradual weight gain and loss. In this short period, what is especially worth synthesizing and highlighting is that Britain is openly strengthening its defenses from Burma, Malaya, Singapore to Australia; the Dutch East Indies is subtly declaring its refusal to join the so-called East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, and is determined to resist aggression by force; the United States has expressed in various ways that it will not let go of Singapore and the Dutch East Indies at least; these points symbolize the completion of the anti-aggression defense line in the South Pacific. Two months ago, no one could make this affirmative statement without reservation.

Not only that, there are also things that can be written about in detail. According to the Reuters Tokyo dispatch, the remarks made by US President Roosevelt when Japanese Ambassador Nomura delivered his credentials, in addition to general responses, Roosevelt "reiterated the US intention to continue to aid Britain with all possible means except participating in the war, and strongly stated that the US deep concern for China has increased because of the belief that the war between China and Europe has become an integral part of the entire war," etc. Assuming that the transmission truly conveyed the essence of the conversation at the time, assuming that our interpretation is not mistaken, then Roosevelt, as the US authority and an international authority, now clearly points out that the two sets of wars in Europe and Asia are an integral part of the entire war, no different from saying that the two wars are one. Making this insinuation to Japan, the meaning is profound, and the possible connections and effects it may have are far-reaching. Now, there is no need to extravagantly state how they are connected and what the effects are, but the mutual pain and mutual dependence of China and Britain in the future has long been clearly understood in China, and Britain can also deeply understand this after regaining its confidence in resisting Germany. Now, President Roosevelt has revealed it from the sidelines.

Because of this, regarding the so-called Sino-British military secret agreement news, regardless of whether it has been signed in secret, or is indeed under negotiation, or the two countries have not yet discussed it, or have negotiated but have different opinions and have not reached an agreement, on the day a war breaks out in the South Pacific, the two countries will inevitably cooperate and help each other due to the urgent needs of the facts. This is almost a tacit understanding in the minds of people in both countries, even without a secret agreement. I once read a military essay by an American who pointed out that if a war breaks out in Burma, Malaya, and the area around Thailand and French Vietnam, it will definitely affect the overall situation. His argument is very correct: at that time, the Chinese army will undoubtedly be the decisive force among them!

### Japanese Troops from Xinyang Invade Northward, Suffering a Crushing Ambush by Chinese Troops; The Japanese Rear Route Southeast of Xinyang is Cut Off; Japanese Troops Invading from Xinye Have Collapsed and Retreating

Chongqing - Military News: (1) On the morning of the 16th, Japanese infantry and cavalry jointly invaded northward near Danshui. Chinese troops met them head-on, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. They were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. (2) A Japanese detachment of over 1,000 troops from Xinyang invaded southward along the Yingxin Highway on the 13th. They were ambushed by Chinese troops near Chongjingchong, resulting in numerous Japanese deaths and the capture of five prisoners. A large amount of military supplies were also seized. (3) More than 1,000 Japanese troops from Zhengdaohu, Taiyangnao, and other locations invaded Fengkou (southeast of Mianyang) on the morning of the 14th. Simultaneously, Japanese troops attacking Wenhekou also invaded westward in two columns. They were intercepted and attacked by Chinese troops, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. Currently, a certain unit of the Chinese army has cut off the Japanese rear route and is working with the frontal Chinese forces to encircle and annihilate the remaining Japanese troops. (4) On the 11th, a Japanese warship, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, sailed from Datong to Panjiagou, east of Tongcheng. Under the cover of aircraft, they landed and advanced towards Qingjiadun.

Sihui - The Battle of Lubao, which began on the morning of the 10th and ended on the 13th, concluded with a major victory for the Chinese army. The battle unfolded as follows: The Japanese forces invading Lubao this time consisted of two regiments from the 38th Division and one regiment from the 囗囗 Division, totaling approximately 5,000 troops. They were supported by 12 mountain guns and two heavy cannons. Their invasion route was as follows: The main force of the 38th Division attacked along the Si-San Highway and the Lubao Highway. Another part of the force advanced to Xinjie, flanking out to Chini, Baini, and Guotaiwei, encircling Datang, with the aim of eliminating the Chinese forces, expanding the periphery of Guangzhou, and seizing resources from Lubao. The Chinese military authorities, having clearly assessed the Japanese situation, immediately ordered the defending troops to strengthen their defenses and arranged strategic measures. The Japanese cavalry, indeed, launched a large-scale invasion under the cover of six aircraft. The Chinese troops responded by holding their positions and engaging the enemy at Xianjueyuan, Dushugang, Shijiu Gang, and other locations. To lure the Japanese forces deeper, the troops were redeployed. Once the fierce fighting began, the Chinese forces initially engaged in long-range shooting, followed by bayonet fighting. The entire army fought resolutely and hard, annihilating over 1,000 Japanese troops. During the battle, for strategic reasons, the Chinese forces moved their troops from Lubao Town towards the northeast corner. The Japanese army fell into the trap, and a portion charged into the urban area of Lubao, where they were completely annihilated by the Chinese army, leaving corpses strewn all over the streets. At Chenshi (7-9 AM) on the 12th, Chinese reinforcements arrived at Shijiao (northeast of Lubao) from a certain location and launched a flanking attack on the Japanese troops entering Datang. The defending troops within the town also launched an inner-line pincer attack during the heavy rain and wind. Knowing they had fallen into a trap, the Japanese troops retreated in defeat from Yangmei in the southwest, passing through Leping Baiguan Kiln, and from Chini, Baini, and Xinjie in the north. The Chinese army achieved a great victory, sending out teams to pursue the enemy while entering the town to comfort the displaced people and handle the aftermath. (16th Dispatch)

### Romanian Government Lays Mines in Territorial Waters of the Black Sea; British Newspaper Predicts Germany Will Launch an Invasion of Bulgaria, Instructing Romania to Prevent Soviet Naval Activities

Bucharest - Bucharest Radio Station yesterday warned merchant ships in the Black Sea that Romanian territorial waters fifteen miles north of Constanta have been mined. The Romanian government declared that ships entering the minefield without the permission of the Romanian Navy would be at risk. Diplomatic circles said that Romania's move, coupled with the rumored demands made by Germany to southern countries, has made the Balkan crisis increasingly acute. According to a report from the southern capital of Belgrade, Germany has granted the following three locations to the southern country: 1. The Trilin Valley in northern Albania and the town of Shkodër, which the southern country has long desired; 2. An outlet to the Aegean Sea through a corridor via Salonica; 3. Territory around the Ohrid River, including Koritsa and other cities occupied by Greek forces. According to the same source, the laying of mines in Romanian territorial waters was at the behest of Germany, to prevent the Soviet Navy from taking action in the area when German troops pass through Bulgaria to reach the Dardanelles. However, this view has not been confirmed. At the same time, diplomatic circles reported that large quantities of food are currently being concentrated in northern Bulgaria, hence the rumor that the entry of German troops into Bulgaria has been scheduled for February 25. (17th International News Agency Dispatch)

London - The London Daily Express predicted this morning that Germany would soon invade Bulgaria. After Bulgaria is completely occupied, Hitler will launch his full-scale "Six-Step" war against Britain. The so-called "Six-Step" war is said to be as follows: (1) Launch a full-scale submarine and air war against British merchant ship ports and transportation lines to prevent supplies from the United States from reaching Britain; (2) Launch a super aerial blitzkrieg against London and other central locations in Britain to overwhelm the British people and hinder the development of defense forces; (3) Repeated attempts at invasion, hoping for eventual success; (4) Launch an action in the Balkans to save Italy's precarious situation in Africa and enable the Axis powers to control the Mediterranean; (5) Japan suddenly enters the war, attacking British Malaya or the Dutch East Indies, cutting off Australia's supplies and dispersing British forces to the Far East; (6) Germany occupies Italy for self-defense, to prevent Italy's collapse and obtain a Mediterranean base for attacking Britain. (17th International News Agency Dispatch)

London - The general public in London today generally believed that the Germans would invade Bulgaria within a week or ten days. It is said that German tank columns or artillery units are moving towards the Romanian-Bulgarian border. It is also said that the 40,000 German troops previously concentrated in Constanta are now boarding ships, preparing to go to Varna, the nearest convenient Bulgarian seaport. British military figures believe that there are about twelve to fifteen German divisions that will cross the Danube River as soon as the weather is mild and the rivers are thawed. They also believe that Germany may even take this step, regardless of the fact that Yugoslavia has not yet agreed to German demands and is unconcerned about the development of the situation in the Balkans. It is reported that the Yugoslav government is studying the conditions put forward by Hitler to the southern country. It is believed here that the conditions put forward by Germany must be to demand that the southern country divide its territory into three parts for Hungary and five parts for Bulgaria in exchange for the land in Albanian north of Lake Ohrid, and to require Yugoslavia to sell all surplus grain to Germany. British figures here also believe that Yugoslavia has decided to resist a frontal attack, but Yugoslavia and Germany have reached some compromises on industrial and political cooperation. (17th United Press Dispatch)

Ankara - According to reliable sources, Germany's military preparations in Bulgaria include strengthening railways, highways, and bridges, and establishing gasoline depots.

According to Sir Hoare, while Britons and most Romanians regret the severing of relations between the two countries, Britain had no choice but to take this step when Germany completely occupied the country. Romanian dictator Antonescu seems to believe that Germany will win. At the same time, Bucharest Radio issued a warning that navigation near Constanta is dangerous in Romanian territorial waters. German troops have now infiltrated Bulgaria in plain clothes. It is generally accepted that the supplies stored in various locations in Bulgaria are for German use, which shows the Bulgarian government's connivance with Germany. (17th Reuters Dispatch)

### Spain and Portugal Suffer Unprecedented Storm Damage; Hundreds Dead and Injured; Ships and Aircraft Destroyed

Madrid – An investigation recently announced that the violent hurricane that struck Spain and Portugal resulted in hundreds of deaths and injuries. A major fire broke out in a city, threatening to destroy it. Twenty ships sank, and dozens of smaller vessels were destroyed. Additionally, ten military aircraft were destroyed. Lisbon remained cut off from communication with most provincial centers this morning.

A train was also destroyed last night, with twenty bodies found in the wreckage and one hundred and twenty people taken to hospitals. The horrific fire in Santarém occurred when a storm destroyed an oil tanker docked in the harbor. Due to the extraordinarily strong and relentless winds throughout the night, firefighters were unable to control the blaze. Some buildings in Santarém and several towns in northern Spain were damaged. All forms of transportation have been disrupted, and roads are blocked by fallen trees and debris. As the flames raged in Santarém, emergency reports were sent by radio to fire departments in Barbo, Victoria, Burgos, Valladolid, and other cities, seeking assistance. Firefighters and equipment were dispatched from cities as far away as Madrid. Soldiers stationed in Burgos were also ordered to assist. According to reports from Gibraltar and nearby La Línea, several small boats were blown ashore, and two seaplanes in the port of Gibraltar were destroyed. The hurricane originated in the Atlantic two days ago, then struck Portugal violently. After causing terrible destruction in Portugal, it wreaked havoc in northern Spain last night. The massive storm stretched from Madeira, 525 miles west of Lisbon, to the French border near the Bay of Biscay. The terrible winds blew an electric train off an elevated track near San Sebastian in Spain last night, resulting in over one hundred and fifty deaths and injuries. Then, early this morning, a major fire erupted in Santarém, threatening to destroy most of the city. It is reported that hundreds have died or been injured in Portugal, and communication with the northern provinces of Spain has been cut off. In the area near Zumaia in northern Spain, over one hundred and fifty people have died or been injured. In Alandroal, Portugal, the roof of a building collapsed due to the wind, killing twenty-seven people. When the hurricane struck, many residents had gathered on the roof to escape the flooding, resulting in the tragedy. Twelve bodies have been found at the site of the collapsed roof last night. Elsewhere, over one hundred people are reported missing. It is widely believed that over eighty people were endangered when the storm hit Ponte de Arga and Alandroal. A train derailment near Elvas, Portugal, also resulted in three deaths. Furthermore, the ship "Guayaba" ran aground in Patoca.

### Americans Urge the President to Supply Food to Britain; Britain and Germany Also Consider Plan to Aid Belgian Refugees

New York – A national movement has been launched in the United States, requesting President Roosevelt to take all necessary measures to ensure the supply of food to the British people. Over a hundred prominent figures have signed a letter to the President, stating that the majority of the American people agree with the President's statement that the United States should be the arsenal of democracy. The letter continues, stating that the soldiers of democracy need more than just weapons; they also need food. Hitler boasts that the German submarines have sunk only the beginning of what will soon be sunk. Soldiers, no matter how brave, must be certain that the country they defend is not threatened by famine in order to achieve victory in land, sea, and air combat. The United States has the ability to prevent this threat from materializing. The letter also states that Germany steals food from the people in the occupied territories to feed the occupying forces. The only way to help the people in the occupied territories is to free them from the shackles of their aggressors. We Americans must know that their hope for liberation has not yet been extinguished, but if Britain falls due to famine, there is no hope for liberation. Therefore, the signatories urge the President to take the necessary steps to make the United States not only the arsenal of democracy but also the food supplier of democracy.

Random Thoughts on the European War (30) (6)

### English Translation:

### War Diary of a British Officer on the Western Front

It appears that the British army has decided to retreat. Significant losses of military equipment are unavoidable. The German army is constantly bombing various ports along the English Channel. Bombs are raining down on Dunkirk. If the British army is truly preparing to retreat, then the sooner the better. Today, the French plan is to arrange the retreat at the southern end of the Allied line in the north. I believe that this is the beginning of the end of the first phase. They may want to evacuate all thirty to thirty-five divisions of the Allied forces by sea to Gibraltar. In my opinion, this is impossible.

5:00 PM: Bad news has arrived from Belgium, the line from Zillebeke to Roeselare to Sinay has been breached.

What is most heartbreaking for us is the lack of fighting spirit. This is perhaps the result of the League of Nations' high-sounding pronouncements over the past twenty years. This is also a major reason for our failure. We do not shout the slogan of "nation first" like the enemy.

Hope is becoming increasingly dim.

May 28th, 8:30 AM: No significant news. An officer was left behind in Le Doucq. He got up in the morning and found that the German army had occupied the town. He told me an interesting escape story today. His wife is French, and he has lived in France for many years, so it was easy for him to disguise himself as a French fisherman. He stayed in the town for the first four days after the German army occupied it. The Germans are in Boulogne. The area of Le Touquet to Abbeville did not seem to be heavily defended. Only a few soldiers patrolled the city. There were also no tanks entering Abbeville. In various locations, only a small number of soldiers rode motorcycles, guarding intersections, with an occasional machine gun or two. He told me that the number of French people hiding in this area compared to the German army was five to one. The German soldiers were very polite. They issued passes to various business people, allowing them to move freely in and out.

This officer gathered several remaining British transportation personnel and returned in a small boat. He also told me that there were many French soldiers in uniform coming and going in the area, but of course, they had no weapons. They had thrown away their rifles. Someone heard a soldier say that if their officers had not fled and there was someone leading them, they could immediately surround and annihilate those German soldiers.

This war is simply too bizarre. There is a lack of conviction, indecisiveness, and especially a reluctance to be serious when facing events. This war in France will not last long.

9:30 AM: Extreme panic. News has arrived that King Leopold of Belgium has surrendered. The details are not yet known.

6:50 PM: Those who know the details are very sad to hear the news of the war on the radio. The radio is filled with politicians making impassioned speeches, talking about the heroic deeds of our army fighting in the north, but no one believes it anymore.

The current question is how many Allied troops in the north can be evacuated. Prime Minister Churchill says that perhaps he will be able to announce definite news at the end of this week. That means there are still four days.

I don't think we will be lingering here for long. The French army can only hold out for a maximum of twenty-one days. They are not fighting sincerely.

May 29th, 6:30 AM: Last night, Mr. Wu Dao'er from H school told me that after the French Seventh Army was defeated, it had completely collapsed. The Ninth Army can no longer fight either. The First Army no longer exists. Except for the ten divisions within the Maginot Line, the French army has only fifty-one divisions left. Ten divisions are stationed along the line from Abbeville to Paris. There are also thirty-five divisions distributed from Montmédy to the coast, a defensive line that is one hundred and eighty miles long.

It is said that the army is retreating smoothly under the cover of smoke screens. One troop transport ship has sunk.

May 30th, 10:00 AM: The news of the evacuation from Dunkirk is even more satisfactory than expected. Fifty-two thousand people have already been evacuated. If there are still low clouds and continuous rain along the English Channel, another twenty-one thousand people can be evacuated tonight.

According to reports from reconnaissance plane pilots, the French have made no preparations along the Aisne River. The bridges have not been blown up, there are very few troops, and there are no cannons or tanks. There are no trenches, and no one is seen digging. There are also no tank traps, and no equipment that deserves to be called obstacles.

This is completely contrary to the information from General Georges. He said that the defenses along the Aisne line were extremely solid. Wu Dao'er and Ao Si Bao Luo, who escaped and returned, confirmed our pilots' reports. On the road, they only encountered small groups of sentries huddled behind incomplete defenses. No machine gun positions were seen anywhere, nor were there any cannons aimed, nor were there any designated security zones. They visited the battalion headquarters near the Aisne and talked to the officer about this situation. The battalion commander was an unshaven, dirty, short man, not much like a soldier. When asked why there were no trenches, he said that the soldiers he led were African Algerian soldiers, and Algerians never dig trenches. This is truly unfortunate for the Algerians, but the misfortune suffered by the land they are supposed to defend is probably even greater. The situation of empty defenses on both flanks is not much different. There are no obstacles that can stop a German tank for even a second.

The German army on the opposite bank easily holds its position. If they want to cross over, they only need to cross the river at Soissons and Rethel. In fact, they only need to walk across as they normally would.

Wu Dao'er and Ao Si Bao Luo passed through Rethél. They said that Reims was like a dead city, neither bombed nor shelled; but there was not a single living person in the city.

The villages on both banks of the Aisne River are uninhabited. They asked the soldiers on the roadside why the villages were as empty as the cities. They pointed to the sky and shrugged their shoulders. From this, it can be seen that the terror generated by bombing is far greater than that of ten thousand cannons.

May 31st, 11:15 AM: The intensity of the fighting at Dunkirk is no less than that of the Battle of the Marne in 1914, but the situation is completely different. It is said that General Prioux's forces have broken through the German lines and have joined the British forces to serve as the rearguard for the troops evacuating from Dunkirk.

General Dill has arrived here today and is probably about to make a final decision. Should Britain risk sending reinforcements to support France in its current situation? This is what should be decided. In my personal opinion, it is not necessary. Our goal is to defeat Germany. Only Britain alone can achieve this goal. If Britain divides a not-very-sufficient force to support a defeated France, it will inevitably lead to mutual destruction. It is better for Britain to rebuild its remaining forces, and even if fighting alone, it will one day be able to achieve final victory and liberate France.

June 3rd, 4:15 PM: Probably around 1:30 PM, we were having snacks when we suddenly heard the terrifying sound of heavy bombers. There were three batches in total, about fifty planes in each batch, flying at an altitude of ten thousand feet. Not a single French fighter plane took off to intercept them. Only after the last batch had safely passed did one or two of the eighteen Morane planes rise to an altitude of three to four thousand feet, firing a few shots aimlessly.

It is said that Germany has nine thousand first-line aircraft at the start of the war. It can manufacture fifteen hundred aircraft per month. Our fighter planes suffered heavy losses in the initial three weeks. Bombers suffered no losses. Therefore, the total number of bombers is constantly increasing.

June 5th, 1:45 PM: Received news at 11:15 AM that the enemy had launched an offensive at 4:00 AM this morning along the line from Amiens to Péronne on the Somme River. At noon, the enemy's mechanized units had broken through at several points. At the same time, enemy forces west of Laon were also advancing towards Soissons along the Vasle River. The speed of the enemy's advance is truly surprising.

June 6th, 6:30 PM: The news from the northern battlefield is bad. The enemy forces are gathering east of Amien and north of Roye. There are probably eight hundred to one thousand tanks. It appears that they will attack Compiègne.

June 7th, 10:15 AM: The battle for Paris has fully begun. There is no reliable news this morning. The entire line is shaky. All kinds of changes are possible.

### Acting in Parallel with the United States: Britain Reiterates Evacuation Advice. Take Advantage of Current Shipping Convenience. British Authorities Issue Registration Forms to Survey Those Leaving or Staying.

Since the US Consul General in Shanghai, on the 13th of this month, received instructions from the State Department in Washington to reiterate the evacuation advice, the situation in the Far East appears to have become more tense. However, all parties acknowledge that this move by the United States does not mean abandoning its interests in the Far East. Its purpose is undoubtedly to warn Japan and express firm opposition to Japan's southward advance. However, the Japanese side is conducting propaganda to stabilize public sentiment and alleviate the impact of the US actions in the Far East. Unexpectedly, the British Embassy also announced a reiteration of the evacuation advice the day before yesterday. According to an observer, there is no need to panic about the current state of the Far East. Britain's evacuation move is clearly a parallel action with the United States, confirming that Britain has likely taken joint steps with the United States to sanction Japan.

British Embassy Reiterates Advice

Reuter reported from Shanghai on the 17th that the British Embassy issued a statement last night for publication in newspapers, which stated that in October of last year, the British authorities had advised those who inquired that any British person who did not have a good reason to reside in the occupied areas of China should consider the advisability of leaving. This advice still applies. The decision to leave or stay, as well as the arrangements arising therefrom, must be made individually according to one's own circumstances. However, when making this decision, it must be understood that it will be almost impossible to obtain special travel conveniences in the short term, and that Far East shipping has been greatly reduced, with a limited supply of ship berths. Tickets must be purchased in advance, and this should also be noted.

Preparing to Voluntarily Evacuate

According to information from the British Embassy, after the evacuation order was issued last year, very few British citizens left Shanghai to join the military in various parts of Malaya, and the number of those who left China was far less than the number of American citizens who evacuated. This is because they were well aware that the international situation and the situation in the Far East would not deteriorate rapidly, and because of their wealth and all their investments, the number of evacuees was not large. However, after the authorities reiterated the previous order this time, all British citizens are likely to obey the order, make all necessary preparations, and voluntarily evacuate.

Issuing Registration Forms to Report Departure

The British authorities have already issued registration forms, requiring all British citizens to fill them out and submit them to the embassy, stating their reasons for leaving or not, and reporting for verification. Those who decide to leave can take Central American ships sailing in the Far East, or go to Canada, or return directly to their home country. Even cargo ships can be used to return to the country, taking advantage of other parts that can accommodate passengers. British consulates throughout the Far East should issue certificates to facilitate the evacuation of citizens. However, according to private information obtained by various British citizens, they are willing to comply with the order and assist in promoting government policies. Those citizens who remain in the occupied areas will later come to Shanghai to gather and wait for ships to evacuate.

British Community Organizations Assist in the Process

The British Association in Shanghai, the British Women's Association, the Great Britain Victory Association, and others believe that since the British government has repeatedly issued evacuation orders, it must be a matter of great national importance, and it is not permissible to allow the citizens to evacuate under disorganization. Therefore, they will convene meetings to quickly organize and assist the government in promoting evacuation work, assisting where there is insufficiency, and striving to see it happen in reality as soon as possible.

Coolidge Ship Tickets Selling Out

It is heard that tickets for the American ship President Coolidge are almost completely sold out. It is expected that a large number of American citizens in this city will take this ship on February 25 to evacuate and return to the United States. The tickets for various ships arriving in Shanghai in the coming months are also being heavily pre-purchased. However, according to an employee of the American President Lines here, the pre-sale of tickets is not as extremely crowded as it was at the end of last year.

### Notes on the Screening of German War Newsreels

Mr. Ke Dejun, Information Commissioner of the German Embassy in China, invited representatives from Chinese and Western newspapers in this city yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM to view the latest European war newsreels that have recently arrived in Shanghai. The total number of topics is as many as forty or fifty sections, lasting four hours. Only half of it was shown yesterday to entertain guests, and the rest will be screened again in the same place next Monday. In terms of material, what was shown yesterday was not limited to combat and destruction. In addition to a part of the German aircraft bombing Britain, there were scenes of German leader Hitler meeting with several giants such as Pétain, Laval, Franco, and Mussolini, as well as German preparations for war, construction work, munitions manufacturing, and food supply. The activities of the German Air Force were much the same as those shown in the previous West Front war newsreel. Iron birds fluttered their wings, soaring into the sky. Upon reaching the target, they descended straight down, throwing bombs like discarding worn-out shoes, with eerie cries that moved people's hearts. In an instant, green smoke billowed from the ground, and in a blink of an eye, various buildings turned to ashes. What was shown on the screen was only half a minute, but the loss of life and property is truly unknown. Next was the German munitions factory manufacturing hydropower, leather boots, and distributing grain, treating the wounded, and employing prisoners in the occupied areas. The sound of gunfire and airplanes was replaced by the sound of machines, slightly relaxing the tense atmosphere. After a while, General Göring suddenly appeared on the screen, awarding the Iron Cross to soldiers who fought bravely in northern France, with a smiling face and a spirited demeanor, as if enjoying it endlessly. After screening for an hour and a half, a section was interspersed, which was an art exhibition held in Munich in 1940. It included sculptures of men with developed muscles and full of vitality, and statues of youthful girls with graceful figures and soft bones, completely uncovered, with a beauty that intoxicated people. In the midst of this chaos of war, it is also strange to have such leisure. At the end of the entire film, scenes of Hitler meeting with Pétain and Laval, meeting with Franco on the Spanish border, and gathering with Mussolini were shown in sequence. The explanation stated that "This kind of meeting surprised the whole world," which can be said to be a faithful report. Before this, there was another film of the street scenes of Paris. Because there were no cars in the city, residents had no choice but to use bicycles as transportation. A strange man with an unusual appearance stepped up to a basket-shaped trailer attached to the back of the car, which was very small and the man was gigantic. The person sitting in the car was not at all surprised, parading through the city. Those who saw this could not help but laugh or cry. "Paris like this" is also lamentable.

### Foreign Ships Sailing to Haikou Are Still Allowed to Clear Customs

The Zhemin (Zhejiang and Fujian) shipping lines have been blocked by the Japanese naval authorities, so the shipping lines of third-country nationalities have been greatly affected. Now, only Haikou is available for clearing customs, but navigation is quite difficult because ships are searched at sea, and if they are not careful, they will be detained. However, foreign ships are still trying to maintain operations in this difficult situation. Recently, it was rumored that Haikou was also notified by the Japanese customs commissioner to stop clearing customs. I inquired with the relevant parties yesterday, and they said that there was no such thing. Moreover, two ships cleared customs at Haikou yesterday, one Italian and one Weiler. As of last night, the ban on clearing customs at Haikou had not been implemented, and it is not expected to be implemented in the near future.

### Two American Banks Cancel Checking Accounts. Checking Deposits Transferred to Savings. Both Foreign Currency and Legal Tender Must Be Deposited and Withdrawn with a Passbook.

Yesterday morning (the 17th), it was learned from reliable sources that the checking accounts of Citibank and Chase Bank in Shanghai will be closed from March 1st and transferred to savings deposit accounts. The reason for taking this step is to prevent the possible expansion of the war in the Far East. The complete details of this new method could not be confirmed yesterday morning. It was only heard that the two major American banks will soon close checking deposits. It was also heard that the two banks will issue passbooks to current depositors, so that these depositors can continue to deposit and withdraw as usual. At the same time, the two banks will allow current depositors to issue checks, which can be directly cashed at the counters of the two banks within the scope of the savings deposits that have been transferred. When making deposits and withdrawals, all depositors must present their passbooks. This system will be implemented from March 1st. Depositors of the two banks will soon receive notices of this change in method. It was also heard yesterday morning that the deposits that the two American banks will close include both foreign currency and legal tender. According to an employee of an American bank yesterday morning, the only reason for taking this new method is prevention.

Launching Economic Warfare Against Japan

According to well-informed financial circles, the reason why the American banks in this city are changing checking accounts to current savings accounts and only allowing customers to withdraw directly from the American banks in this city and the New York headquarters is to deal with Japan. This is because the Japanese side has obtained a large amount of legal tender from customs and other agencies to exchange for US dollars and open accounts in the above-mentioned two banks, and they are unwilling to open accounts in New York. Although business people believe that this move by the American banks will cause some inconvenience, everyone believes that this matter will have little impact on the business of this city. It was impossible to find out yesterday whether other foreign banks will follow the example of the American banks and take the same measures. People in the American Express Bank said that they have not yet received instructions from the New York headquarters on this issue. If the banks follow the example of the American banks and take precautionary measures, then merchants will not be able to obtain US dollars. If so, then the method of accumulating legal tender and selling foreign exchange will completely fail. The Chinese business community expresses a special welcome to this move, because this move is very beneficial to legitimate Sino-American trade.

### Bloodshed Incident in the French Concession Last Night: Peng Bowei Was Sniped. Shot Twice at the Intersection of Rue Luber and Avenue du Lupan. Life in Danger.

Peng Bowei, a native of Hunan, 54 years old, lives at No. 44, Le'anfang, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. He previously served as the captain of the Detective Team of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters and a standing member of the Seamen's Union. He is currently the chairman of a certain "Seamen's Union". Yesterday at 6:15 PM, Peng Bowei was walking near the intersection of Rue Luber and Avenue du Lupan in the French Concession when suddenly three or four people flashed out from the roadside and fired two shots at Peng Bowei. Peng was hit by one bullet each in his left waist and left thigh, was wounded and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled towards Route Tenant de Villeviers. When the nearby Chinese constables heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene, they saw that the shooters had long since disappeared. They quickly called an ambulance and sent Peng to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries are serious, and his life may be in danger. At the time, Peng was wearing a gray mink fur coat, covered with a Maconi overcoat, a felt hat, and cotton shoes. After the incident, the police sent detectives to the scene to investigate and carry out investigations.

### Chief Editor of the China Press, Ault, Succeeds. Gold to Return to the U.S. on Schedule

The China Press stated yesterday that the newspaper's editor, Gold, has served for six years. Because he was ordered by the newspaper's owner, Steele, to serve at the New York headquarters, he is scheduled to return to the United States on the President Coolidge on the 25th of this month. Therefore, yesterday he handed over the editorial responsibility of the China Press to Ault, the current deputy editor. Gold joined the China Press in 1931, initially working in the editorial department and being promoted to editor-in-chief in 1934. For many years, he has edited the newspaper and enjoys a high reputation in the Far East news circle. The new editor-in-chief, Ault, has a long history in the news circle, having served as a reporter in New York, Washington, Tokyo, and other places, and has also served as a reporter for the United Press in Northeast China and Japan. He returned to Shanghai in the summer of last year to join the editorial department of the Great Beauty Evening News.

### Suspension Order for Dutch Ships Has Been Revoked

It is heard that the Dutch authorities have revoked the order for Dutch ships to stop at the Shanghai port and various ports in Japan in the Far East. Regarding why this order was issued and why it was revoked, the person in charge of the company stated that it was an order from the authorities and it was not convenient to speculate. The neutrality port order should also not apply. Therefore, the Chipad ship will sail to Java via Xiamen and Hong Kong tomorrow, and will return after it leaves. As for the Chiba Djakarta, it has already arrived in Nanyang and will also sail to Shanghai. The date of its arrival is pending a report by telegram.

### Impersonating the Three People's Principles Youth League to Intimidate and Extort

Recently, a type of letter bearing the name of the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League has been discovered on the market, attempting to intimidate and extort from all walks of life in the name of charitable relief work. However, this designation is merely intended to impersonate the name of the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, which is believed by ordinary patriotic youth, in order to achieve its cunning trick of confusing the public. In addition to the fact that the relevant parties have thoroughly investigated it, people from all walks of life are well aware that this behavior is a habitual trick of unscrupulous elements to swindle and deceive, and they all ignore it, warning each other not to be deceived.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Train Bombed While Passing Through Hushu Pass

The day before yesterday (Sunday) at 5:00 PM, a freight train from Ningbo to Shanghai, full of cattle, chickens, ducks, wooden boxes, burlap bags, etc., encountered a bomb explosion about two Hua Li east of Hushu Pass. Sand and stones flew everywhere, the tracks were destroyed, and the vehicles were overturned on the roadside, totaling thirteen vehicles, with considerable losses and great chaos. When the guards there learned of this and came to investigate, they reported to the nearby station by telephone and forwarded the report to the Shanghai station, trying to go to the rescue. Therefore, yesterday, except for a train from Suzhou to Shanghai on the Shanghai-Nanjing line in the morning, all other passenger and freight trains, both up and down, were suspended, and even the Shanghai-Hangzhou passenger train did not sell tickets. Repairs are currently underway.

### Officer Promotions in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Mann Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel as Temporary Deputy Commander.

The headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession, with the approval of the Municipal Council, promoted a large number of personnel. (1) Chief of General Affairs Staff Major Mann was promoted to temporary Deputy Commander and promoted to Lieutenant Colonel. (2) Russian Corps Captain San Fuluofu was promoted to Major. (3) Engineering Corps Lieutenant Blake was promoted to Captain. (4) Philippine Corps Lieutenant Salu Lawyer was promoted to Captain.

(5) Military Doctor Lieutenant Sun Bangfan. (6) Officer Reserve Team B Group Captain Fan Keling. The above-listed personnel all continue to serve in their original ranks.

### Three Walun Yoko Company’s Ships Conscripted. Moored in Shanghai Awaiting Orders. Sail to Designated Locations Upon Order.

British merchant ships and Norwegian and Greek ships in this city have long been under the control of the Navy Department. Although they still operate according to the usual routes, they can be conscripted at any time. In the past, many ships on the Yangtze River and Qianjiang River have been transferred to Singapore. Recently, two Walun Yoko Company ships have suspended operations and are waiting for dispatch. Swire Company's Northern Line Shenyang has been ordered to be dispatched. Therefore, it returned to Shanghai from Tianjin on the sixth and immediately suspended operations for repairs. It has been completed yesterday and will sail to Hong Kong within days and then go to Singapore. The three Walun Yoko Company ships are waiting for orders in Shanghai. As soon as the order arrives, they will sail to the designated location.

### Temporary Suspension of Grain Price Stabilization; Over Four Million Yuan Already Paid for Public Granary Contributions

Since the Shanghai Grain Price Stabilization Committee stopped managing the eighth phase of broken rice price stabilization on January 15th, a month has passed. Various sectors have earnestly hoped that the committee could continue to manage the fifth phase of price stabilization. The committee convened a plenary meeting yesterday, chaired by Yu Qiaqing. After discussion, it was generally agreed that managing price stabilization was an urgent task. However, due to numerous difficulties making it difficult to begin in the short term, it was resolved that the ninth phase of price stabilization would be temporarily postponed. It will commence immediately once there is progress.

Public Granary Rice Funds

The Shanghai Public Granary Rice Management Committee, in its first meeting, resolved to first collect 50% of the pledged cash and rice amounts from various individuals and industries before proceeding with procurement. As of now, the total amount collected is 4,494,700 yuan. The committee is diligently urging those individuals and industries that have not yet paid to do so. The current payments received from various individuals and industries are as follows: Banking industry: 1,700,000 yuan; Money exchange industry: 425,000 yuan; Department stores: 74,375 yuan; Woolen goods industry: 42,500 yuan; Flour mills: 212,500 yuan; Cotton cloth industry: 85,000 yuan; New medicine and pharmaceutical industry: 100,625 yuan; Coal industry: 214,625 yuan; Sugar industry: 63,750 yuan; Construction industry: 31,250 yuan; Spinning mills: 719,000 yuan; Timber industry: 10,625 yuan; Soybean and grain industry: 713,575 yuan; Bao Ren Tang: 63,750 yuan; Cheng Qi Tang: 42,500 yuan. The total is 4,494,700 yuan. As for the individuals and industries that are in arrears, the committee is continuing to send separate letters urging them to promptly send the unpaid amounts to any of the two banks, namely, the Continental Bank and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, or the two money exchange shops of Fuyuan and Shunkang, and simultaneously notify the committee so that funds can be quickly collected and procurement can begin to benefit the people's food supply.

Increased Capital for Rice Businesses

The Soybean and Rice Industry Association, in order to increase the capital of rice businesses, yesterday issued a special announcement to the market, stating that in January of this year, the association's executive and supervisory board meetings resolved that henceforth, the minimum capital for newly organized firms should be 30,000 yuan, and for existing businesses, the minimum capital should be 20,000 yuan. Those who do not meet this amount are required to submit registration forms and supporting documents to the association for registration by February 15th of this year. The deadline has been extended to the end of February of this year. There will be no further extensions. Those who still fail to comply will have their rights to enter the market and make purchases suspended.

### Rampant Civilian Draft in Hongkou; Residents Afraid to Leave Their Homes; Over 1,000 People Conscripted in Three Days and Sent to Various Battlefields for Hard Labor

Japanese troops in the Hongkou area suddenly began conscripting civilians on the evening of the 15th (Sunday). By yesterday, over one thousand residents had been conscripted. As a result, Chinese residents in the Hongkou area have been staying indoors, and residents of the concession area are unwilling to venture into this unjust place. The following is according to a gentleman who was conscripted and escaped, speaking to a Dagong News reporter:

Most of Those Conscripted are Laborers

I (the conscripted person speaking) went out to visit a friend at 9:00 PM on the 15th. While walking near the end of Yangshupu Road, I was suddenly seized by three Japanese military police and dragged to the sixth floor of the Japanese military headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. There were already over 500 conscripted civilians there, all of whom were laborers. The weather was extremely cold that day, and several people had not yet had dinner, so they were in dire straits due to hunger and cold. However, when they asked the translator (employed by the Japanese) to go out and buy food, they were refused. The translator also told me, "You must not show any signs of hunger or cold in front of the Japanese, otherwise you will be beaten severely." Later, I asked where we were being taken, and they replied,

Sent to the Front Lines for Labor

"You will mostly be sent to various battlefields to serve as laborers, or to the first line of defense." Upon hearing this, I was extremely frightened. Around 10:00 PM, I saw a unit of over ten Japanese soldiers, holding bayonets, enter and drag away over 200 people. My departure time was at midnight. Shortly after midnight, I saw a unit of Japanese soldiers enter and force us to go downstairs and board trucks. When we reached the vicinity of the Wenzaobang, I decided to seize the opportunity to escape, because I thought that even if I went, there would be no chance of survival, so it was better to escape from death. Therefore, when the truck stopped briefly, I jumped out of the truck and into the river. As soon as I swam to the other side, I heard a gunshot, but I had already taken refuge in a broken cave. Soon after, I heard the sound of the army moving away and then silence. I returned home at 3:00 AM the next morning, but my family had already been greatly alarmed.

Six Barber Shops Reopened Yesterday Morning

Employees of six barber shops in the French Concession, including Huaxin, Paris, Yuegong Xiahfei, Baimei Gui, and Baimei Gui branch on Foch Road, resumed work yesterday morning, after having been on strike since the morning of the 9th of this month, demanding that management improve profit sharing. According to a Dagong News reporter, the management agreed to resolve the issues after the employees resumed work. All employees of the barber shops have returned to work since yesterday morning. The issue of profit sharing is still under negotiation between labor and management, and it is expected to be fully resolved next week.

Suspension of Navigation of the Yinxi Small Steamboat

According to communication from transportation circles, travelers from Shanghai to Ningbo used to take a steamboat to Xikou, then transfer to a Jinxi intermodal vehicle. It is now learned that the Yinzhou Creek small steamboat, which runs on the Yong River between Ningbo and the Yinjiang Bridge, has been approved to suspend its operations from today. Due to the high price of diesel fuel, making revenues insufficient, and the difficulties in allocating fuel, as well as sluggish business, the service has become unsustainable. Passengers traveling to and from will have to take ships from now on.

### Donations for the New Pu Yu Hall; Enthusiastic Support from All Sectors; A Great Manifestation of Social Compassion

The New Pu Yu Hall in the Nanshi (Southern City) area has been established for over thirty years and is a charitable organization that manages the relief of orphaned boys and girls, as well as the elderly, weak, and disabled, in a most comprehensive manner. Over the years, it has benefited over ten thousand people, especially in the nurturing and education of children, which has been highly praised by people from all walks of life. Its expenses are entirely derived from donations from kind-hearted women and men from all walks of life, enabling it to be maintained year-round. However, since the passing of Mr. Lu Bohong, who was the most ardent supporter, donations have inevitably decreased. Coupled with the rising prices of everything in recent years, it has become even more difficult to maintain.

Although the amount is small, it is only a token of our concern for others. The surnames of the ten members of the meeting are not to be disclosed. Please forgive us.

### Manager of Dayouyu Oil Factory Robbed in Broad Daylight; Loss of 4,900 Yuan

The Dayouyu Machine Oil Pressing Factory, located at No. 26, Che Dai Jiao, West Suzhou Road, in the Hongkou area, has been established for many years and is thriving. It also has a distribution department at No. 27, Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road. The general manager is Zhang Lunqing from Liuhe. Around 9:05 AM yesterday morning, Zhang went to the factory to work as usual, placing 4,900 yuan in oil payments from the retail department in his pocket, intending to take it to the distribution department on Beijing Road. At the Yunfei Automobile Branch Station at No. 9, Baike Road, he rented a No. 12244 car driven by a local driver named Lin Gen. When the car arrived in front of the factory gate, Zhang was already waiting at the entrance, ready to get into the car. Unexpectedly, three bandits ambushed nearby. One pointed a box cannon, and two held handguns, intercepting Zhang, pointing the weapons at his chest, and forbidding him to speak. They robbed him of all 4,900 yuan in oil payments from his pocket and fled on bicycles. Afterwards, Zhang reported the incident to the responsible police station based on information received, requesting an investigation.

### Widow Commits Suicide by Slitting Throat Over Neighbor's Stolen Overcoat; Death From Severed Throat; Only Son Left an Orphan

Dai Wu, a 30-year-old widow from Jiangxi, residing on the third floor of No. 4, Aido Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, passed away three years ago. Wu raised a single son, Ri Hua (16 years old this year), born to her husband's previous wife, by working as a seamstress. Her son is currently studying in elementary school. Chen Jiafu, a Ningbo native, lived with her. On the 8th of this month, an overcoat valued at over one hundred yuan was stolen. At that time, there was no way to investigate, so it was not made public. On the afternoon of the 15th, Chen's eleven-year-old daughter, Gui Di, went to Wu's room to play and found a piece of cloth with Chen Jiafu's name written on it, which was from the missing overcoat, in Wu's room. She reported it to Chen Jiafu, who obtained this subtle evidence. The next day, Chen reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate and took Dai Wu into custody. Wu, fearing pain and suffering at the time, admitted to the theft against her will. She asked someone to invite Zhang Guozhen, a Henan native who was a friend of her husband and worked as an investigator at the Dafang Hotel, to the police station, begging Zhang to vouch for her, willing to go outside and return the overcoat. The police chief then ordered the original detective to take Chen Jiafu and Dai Wu home together to retrieve the overcoat. However, on the way, Wu thought to herself that she had absolutely not stolen the overcoat and was being falsely accused of being a thief. Not only was her reputation ruined, but she could not face anyone, and when she got home, she had no way to hand over the original item. In desperation, she had a moment of rashness. Upon arriving home, she falsely told the accompanying detectives that she needed to use the restroom, then entered the room to relieve herself. The detectives waited patiently outside the door for a moment, waiting for her to finish before taking back the overcoat. The detectives deeply believed her, but as soon as Wu entered the room, she used a sharp pair of scissors to stab her throat, penetrating an inch deep, and fell to the ground wounded. Only then did the detectives hear the sound and enter the room, discovering Wu's suicide. They quickly snatched the scissors and called the neighbors to help lift her downstairs and send her to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the detective took the murder weapon, the sharp scissors, back to the police chief to report. Because her throat had been severed and the injury was in a vital spot, there was no way to save her. She died at 6:00 PM that afternoon. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall. Yesterday, the deceased's son, Dai Rihua, took the body along with relatives to negotiate with Chen Jiafu, who had lost the overcoat. As a result, Chen paid for a simple burial. Chen Jiafu caused a life to be lost due to the lost coat. The loss of both the coat and the money is a small matter, but the deceased's son has become an orphan without parents, creating problems with his life and education. It is a truly unfortunate disaster. The elders of Dai Rihua are devising a way to maintain his life and education.

It starts manufacturing light bulbs at 8:00 AM every day. The boiler for the factory's own source of fire used in the manufacture of light bulbs is installed in the factory's courtyard. Because the boiler's temperature is extremely high, while workers were working near the boiler around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the boiler suddenly exploded due to excessive heat, with a sound that shook the neighborhood. Because the force of the explosion was very strong, the glass windows of the buildings near the courtyard and the adjacent bungalows were shattered. Glass shards flew and fell on the road outside the factory. At that time, six pedestrians were injured in the head and face. They were: (1) Shi Chen (37 years old, injured hands and head), (2) Yin Xiaodi (8 years old, injured right hand), (3) Shen Diao (29 years old, injured hand), (4) Shao Xiaodi (37 years old, injured head and face), (5) Yin Wang (48 years old, injured face), (6) Gao Youquan (37 years old, injured hands and face).

It is estimated that the big Ditongkang Yongshun Yuan and others exerted themselves, and the price fell in stages amidst the excess supply and insufficient demand, and soon entered the 200 yuan pass, reporting 6,155 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange suddenly had a puller, the price rebounded slightly, which inspired Chida, Tongyongtai Xiangxingyong and others to come to buy, and was pulled out of the 6,200 yuan pass, rising to 6,240 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange merchants still had a tight-fisted mentality when they saw the high price, in order to maintain the lack of supply, and remained as low as 6,180 yuan. The noon closing was 6,205 yuan. The afternoon opening was still expensive, at 6,225 yuan. The price was good five yuan in an instant, and it reached 6,230 yuan. Afterwards, due to the negative news from the exchange market, people's hearts were greatly affected, such as Dafeng, Renchengyong, and Xinfengyong, all of whom frantically threw, and quickly crossed the 200 yuan pass, falling directly to 6,040 yuan. Although Tiancheng Hengji and others bought in after this, they only rebounded to 6,070 yuan, and the evening closing was only 6,060 yuan, which was 75 yuan lower than the weekend closing. The spot price was more than 210 yuan higher than the futures price in the morning, and it was heard that it had risen to 275 yuan in the afternoon. There were not many transactions. The daily futures price fluctuated 210 yuan. The selling price of the gold of the cash number was more than ten yuan higher than the raw gold (spot), and the incoming price was thirty yuan lower. The current standard gold was hung at fifty or sixty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.

Gold Jewelry in Silver Building Large and Flat

The exchange price of gold jewelry per tael in the silver building rose ten yuan at 9:45 AM to 660 yuan. The price was ten yuan lower at 4:00 PM. It is estimated that Daitonghang still hung at 650 yuan, and Xintonghang was similar to the above price. The incoming price was thirty yuan lower.

### Securities: Government Bonds Show Mixed Gains and Losses; Foreign Stocks Have Risen

Yesterday's situation in the black market for government bonds was still in the struggle between bulls and bears. The high and low still fluctuated by one yuan and several jiao. The two sides are making a final struggle. Who will die is still uncertain. However, there were sudden rumors in the afternoon that foreign exchange had risen sharply and gold had fallen sharply. People's hearts were also weak, and the situation was not good. Therefore, the good prospects in the future are ultimately limited. However, it is also said that now that the floating capital is concentrated in Shanghai, the silver root is loose and excessive, and the interest rate is only 70%. Banks have reduced interest rates one after another, 2 or 3% for current deposits, and foreign banks have no interest. Government bonds are equal to cash and are not as convenient as bank current deposits. The chances of winning the lottery for Type E unified bonds range from 12 to 36 for Type A, twice a year, and the face value right per hundred yuan is about four yuan and eight jiao, plus interest of six yuan, a total of ten yuan and eight jiao. Calculated at an average market price of 65 yuan, the interest rate is weakly 1.7%, which is different from the safety of the cotton yarn and gold trade that fall by hundreds of yuan at a time. Therefore, it is believed that if there is a war in the Pacific, the future of Chinese government bonds will be even brighter, so it is said that the bond market will not end up in decline. Yesterday's transactions: Xinfu bought in more in the morning, followed by Renchang and Renfeng, while Hongda was the most seller, followed by Xie Kangrun Lianyi Hengkang. Therefore, the market price closed as high as 64 yuan and one jiao, and only 62 yuan and eight jiao. Xinfu continued to buy in the afternoon and still had surplus courage. Hengkang Xinhua Changji Lianyi followed. However, Hongda still had a large number of long positions coming out, and others such as Xiechang Xinchang Yitai Tongkang Runli Tongxing all sold. The market price rebounded several jiao, and the result of the competition was a continuous rise of two jiao to five jiao, but Type B bond rebounded two jiao. The total number of transactions was about 2.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 25 Guanshengyuan shares were traded at a price of 70 yuan.

The public stock market opened with a good spirit, and the prices rose a lot from the previous closing. Although the selling users took advantage of the high price to emerge, the potential was always extremely stable. The transaction of the famous shares was very large. Due to the recovery of confidence, the rubber shares also rebounded.

### Grain: Rice Merchants Most Like Gunpowder Smell; Japanese Attempt to Advance South Recreates Opportunities for Rice Merchants; Foreign Rice Reaches Price Limit, Indica Rice Drastically Increased by Three Yuan; But the Source Still Has More Than 40,000 Bags

Since the South Seas situation became tight a week ago, the foreign rice market has driven the market to see repeated price increases, and the hoarding power is getting higher and higher, and the search is becoming more and more urgent. In fact, Japan still does not dare to try easily. The United States, Central Netherlands, and Australia have been prepared. The dream of advancing south will not break out under the heavy force for a while, unless there is a major change in the European situation. However, in general, this is a concern, so at the opening yesterday, the rising wind became even more intense. Before the opening, actual sales were the first priority, and they had been searching in various ways. In addition, the floating hoarding retail investors fueled the waves, which led to the sellers' minds being firmer and the profit recovery was stronger. By the middle of the market, all the prices of various goods, except for the middle and second-grade goods, had reached the price limit. If the small patterns of Pudong Wharf also reached 75 yuan and nine jiao, although the market had hit a wall after that, the selling atmosphere was still strong, without the slightest retreat, and the bee movement was abnormal all the way, and the closing was still firm. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon is 85 yuan, Zhongguan 84 yuan to 83 yuan and a half, No. 2 is 80 yuan, second is 78 yuan and a half, No. 1 Siam is 85 yuan to 83 yuan and a half, Huojiao is 84 yuan to 83 yuan, Xiaojiao is 76 yuan and eight jiao and 75 yuan and a half, Min Dang rice is 86 yuan, Dajiao is 75 yuan, Miliu is 70 yuan to 71 yuan, broken tip is 67 yuan to 65 yuan, and Wuhu tip is 76 yuan and three jiao. Compared with the prices mentioned above, the prices have risen by another yuan and a half from the week before, but the goods on the way are coming to Shanghai one after another, and have not been interrupted. On the contrary, the new order is passed through the exchange rate lengthening, and Heyi Foreign Company also has 5,000 tons of Xiaowen in March for sale in the market, at a price of 88 yuan. It is said that it is still in the electric commercial ship position, which is still similar to the previous market. It is also rumored that there are many direct orders in the brewing, so the prices of various rice in the futures market rise and fall, and the result is only four or five jiao higher than last Saturday. The opening-out call back Huasi No. 1 Saigon is now 99 yuan and a half, No. 2 is 92 yuan and four jiao, and Xiaojiao is now 90 yuan and one jiao to five jiao. The goods loaded on January 15 are 90 yuan, February is 88 yuan and two jiao, 88 yuan and a half, 89 yuan, and February and March are 88 yuan and three jiao. The transaction is nearly 2,000 tons, and there are also more than 15,000 bags of spot goods.

At a glance, the arrival of foreign rice is still in large batches, one after another. Yihua Foreign Company's Mingsheng wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (Sunday), carrying 21,767 bags from Hong Kong, and stopped at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel also arrived in port on Sunday, carrying 4,649 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the main bank wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. Fork Taikoo Company's Guangdong wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 7,627 bags from Hong Kong, and also docked at the main bank wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. There is also Suzhou wheel, which also arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, carrying 9,505 bags from Hong Kong, and temporarily stopped in Pudong, waiting to be moved to the Bund of the French Concession for unloading today.

Due to continuous rain, the source of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice has been cut off, and at the appropriate market rumors, the question of soaring foreign rice, people's hearts are particularly excited. The goods are scarce and precious, so most of the cargo owners regard them as rare goods and shout wildly, and the shopkeepers also need them urgently. Seeing that the market goods are not enough to be distributed, they are afraid of being left out, so they compete with each other regardless of the high price. Therefore, the market has become an unexpected violent rise. If Qingjiao see thin rice open 99 yuan to 96 yuan and a half, the original bag is 102 yuan, and it has drastically increased by three yuan, and the Kunshan original white japonica rice opens 108 yuan to 106 yuan, and the view sees 102 yuan to 100 yuan, especially 104 yuan, which has also increased by about two yuan. As for the lack of goods in the special goods of Changbang, there is no market.

Although the actual sales of glutinous rice are still not smooth, most major households see that the prices of various goods are soaring, and they regard the glutinous rice price as uniquely flat, and they recognize that they can make profits, and they hoard them a lot. Therefore, once the selling price is attracted, it also increases by about one yuan, opening Hong Kong special 82 yuan, ordinary 81 yuan, 80 yuan, and glutinous tea 745 yuan.

### Over Ten Thousand Bags of Flour Arrive in Shanghai: Market Fluctuates Before Stabilizing

The flour market, including both foreign and domestic flour, experienced initial tightness followed by stabilization yesterday. Since rumors of U.S.-Japan tensions spread late last week, speculation and hoarding were rampant. At the opening, with rice prices already high, Zhonglou brand foreign flour soared to $24.40, up 20 cents from before. However, rumors circulated in the afternoon that Wei Da Foreign Firm and others had received telegrams stating that large shipments of Canadian and Australian flour, initially over 100,000 bags, were expected to arrive today, with subsequent batches following closely. This led to a slight decrease in actual demand from local buyers, and more sellers were eager to offload goods en route. Few buyers were interested, except for the highly regarded Hongri Dangtian flour, which attracted some bulk buyers. Over 300 bags of this flour were traded yesterday at $24.80 per bag. Flour from domestic factories was still sold at a flat rate of $23, with over 6,000 bags released from both factories. The market outlook suggests that with the continuous arrival of goods, prices may have difficulty remaining high.

The wheat market yesterday remained stagnant. There was almost no activity, as shipments from inland areas were cut off due to rain, and Japanese factories had no stock to collect. Restrictions were temporarily not eased. Domestic factories had access to newly arrived foreign wheat, allowing for a slight increase in flour production. Therefore, the market saw no significant development.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Rampant Speculation, Unpredictable Soybean Cake Prices

The soybean cake market yesterday fluctuated wildly amidst numerous rumors, emboldening speculators. The soybean oil market opened with an unstable trend, dropping by about one dollar from the end of last week. Later, positive sentiment grew, and the atmosphere became tense, resulting in prices exceeding the previous day's by 50 cents to one dollar. 400 barrels of Dalian spot oil were traded, initially at $112, then falling to $111.75, before rebounding to $113.50. 200 barrels for March delivery were traded at $113.75 to $114. 500 barrels for April delivery fell from $114.75 to $113.75, before jumping to $115.75. Peanut oil and tung oil rose by one dollar, while basketed oil remained stable. The destination of spot soybean cake included three trucks of Yuanlong cake and one truck of Feizi cake procured by inland agents. Speculation continued to dominate the forward market, with bulls and bears battling fiercely throughout the day, causing prices to fluctuate wildly. Initially rising and then falling in the morning, the near-term contracts closed slightly higher by three or four cents compared to Saturday, while the long-term contracts fell by three cents. The afternoon session reversed the morning trend, with buyers flooding the market. At the peak, prices briefly rose by another cent, but were eventually suppressed by aggressive short selling, leading to a soft close. 20,000 pieces of Sheng Ji cake for March delivery were traded at prices ranging from $14.25 to $14.30, then falling to $14.18. Over 20,000 pieces for late March delivery were traded at prices ranging from $14.32 to $14.18, then rebounding to $14.46, before falling again to $14.40. Over 30,000 pieces for April delivery were traded at prices ranging from $14.40 to $14.37, then rising to $14.59, before falling again to $14.48.

### Yarn and Cotton: Profit-Taking Covers Shorts, Cotton Yarn Experiences Minor Rebound

The yarn market, after two days of sharp declines, experienced a slight rebound yesterday. At the same time, purchases by Hong Kong agents were more active than the previous day, alleviating concerns. The highest price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was $1284, and the lowest was $1232. It finally closed at $1264 in the afternoon and fell to $1260 then rising slightly to $1230. 55 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today.

The opening sentiment for Shuangma yarn was still weak, but slightly firmer than the previous day. Due to the significant decline, profit-takers covered their short positions. The opening price was $1240, falling slightly to $1232. News of stable gold prices led to a rebound, and profit-takers again came in to buy, boosting confidence and pushing the market from low to high, gradually rising to $1283. Unexpectedly, as prices rose, selling pressure increased, and prices suddenly fell to $1255. However, a large player covered their short position and turned slightly bullish, causing the market to rebound to $1269 at the close. Total transaction volume for half the day was 8850 bales. A breakdown of purchases by various agencies is listed below:

### Cotton Market Remains Sluggish

The spot cotton market remained sluggish and inactive. This was due to the uncertainty in the yarn market, which initially rose in the morning but fell sharply in the afternoon, further impacting the cotton market.

In the New York cotton market, spot traders and southern agencies were both selling, leading to a weak market due to heavy selling pressure. As a result, closing prices continued to fall by six or seven points from the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially fell due to unrest in the Pacific region. Although it briefly rebounded due to short covering, it eventually fell again as long positions were liquidated. Yesterday, futures prices fell by 1.5 rupees.

Although the yarn market in Shanghai showed signs of recovery yesterday, and the exchange rate further eased, creating favorable conditions for raw cotton trading, overall confidence remained low, resulting in a quiet market with no sign of any impulse to trade.

### Piece Goods: Sluggish Sales, Minimal Price Increases

The piece goods market initially rose and then fell yesterday, with a weakening trend. At the start of the morning, the exchange rate increased, which led to a rise in piece good prices. However, the ultimately inactive sales market resulted in a slight return of prices, and the sales market increased only slightly more than the previous Saturday. Fine cloth increased by 25 to 50 cents per piece, twill increased by 50 to 75 cents, coarse cloth increased by about 50 cents, and bleached and dyed cloth increased by nearly one dollar. Over 300 pieces of various fabrics were traded in this street, and the buyers were slightly active, but the quantity was minimal. Buyers from Wenzhou and Ningbo purchased 70 to 80 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth, buyers from Fujian purchased 50 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, and buyers from Hong Kong purchased more than 100 pieces of twill and colored cloth.

The East cloth market lacked the strength to rise due to stagnant real sales from all regions. In the spot market, the opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was briefly called up to $43 due to the rebound in yarn prices and the cover from retail investors, but it quickly fell again after the industry quickly sold off at high prices. The morning closed at $42.50. In the afternoon, the price of gold continued to plummet, rumors flared up again, and the human heart was empty, and the price plunged to $40.03. The closing price of Sizijun serge was $1.13. The closing price of standard cloth futures (trading place) for this month was $42.

### Sugar Market: Continued Arrival of Foreign Sugar

Shanghai sugar merchants were overjoyed by the expectation that Dutch sugar imports would be interrupted, and the price rose sharply. However, unexpectedly, large quantities continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong and Suzhou ships, in addition to large quantities of foreign rice, also brought a large amount of cane sugar. The Guangdong ship carried 8650 bags, and the Suzhou ship also carried 4050 bags. (

Anecdotes

### Reward for Capturing the British Prime Minister

— Zhi Hui

In the winter of the year before last, the British Royal Air Force flew over German skies for the first time, not dropping a single bomb, but merely scattering some "paper bombs"—leaflets—and returning. At that time, it aroused the ridicule and mockery of the shrimp soldiers and crab generals under Hitler, who believed that the British Air Force was exposing its weakness and was not worth attacking. However, on the other hand, the German people were strictly forbidden to pick up British leaflets, otherwise they would face the danger of being executed.

Unexpectedly, when Hitler launched an aerial blitz against England last year, he also copied the old British tactic that the Germans had ridiculed. It turned out that they were also good at using "paper bomb warfare." The British accepted the German "paper bombs" very calmly. Fearing that most people would not know the contents of the "paper bombs" in detail, London newspapers specially printed them, which could be regarded as fulfilling the greatest publicity obligation for Hitler.

The front of the "paper bomb" was a small portrait of British Prime Minister Churchill, holding a light submachine gun, with an appearance very similar to a bandit in an American detective film. Above it was the title "Reward," and below it was: "Capture this instigator of war." The British Prime Minister in this photo also had a cigar in his mouth and a smiling face. The back of the photo was several lines of not-so-fluent English: "This rogue in the photo, he encourages you to wage war like him, making all women, children, and innocent people his pioneers. All wars have long been prohibited by the Hague Peace Conference. Why not bring this autocratic demon who incites war to a military court? Quickly save this war disaster, or at least save your own family!"

Churchill himself, after reading this "wanted" leaflet, couldn't help but recall another incident in the past: Thirty-eight years ago, during the South African Boer War, Churchill was a young reporter, serving as a war correspondent. Once, he was captured by the enemy and imprisoned. After several twists and turns, he finally escaped. At that time, because a prisoner had escaped from the enemy camp, such a notice could be seen everywhere on the thoroughfares of Transvaal:

Heavy Reward for Capture—Dead or Alive!

American, 25 years old, tall, about eight feet high; no particularly noticeable physical characteristics, but slightly stooped when walking; fair complexion, reddish-brown hair, no beard; often speaks with a nasal tone, and cannot pronounce the S sound very clearly.

These two famous "wanted" encounters in Churchill's life are now widely circulated among British men, women, old, and young, becoming a very interesting topic of conversation.

Education

### Children's Voices of Reading

— Ke Ting

More than a year ago, when we first moved here, we often heard the sound of reading aloud in the morning and evening. It was a child of about ten years old who lived downstairs from us. When I first stepped into their room, I found three school reward frames hanging on the dim walls, adding a lot of glory.

His father was a worker in a silk factory, working day and night shifts. He and his mother had to handle all the housework and take care of a younger brother. Sometimes before I got up in the morning, I could already hear him reading. Sometimes when I passed by the railing in the middle of the night, I could still see him doing his homework, because he wouldn't have time to do it at home during the day.

My acquaintance with him was already near the end of that semester. He couldn't do a few arithmetic problems and came to ask me, looking embarrassed. He listened quietly and remembered all the steps I showed him. Finally, I asked him about the next semester, but he said unhappily:

"Dad said we can't even afford to eat, what's the point of studying?"

"Oh," I paused slightly and replied with one word, but many unspoken words welled up in my heart. Looking into his eyes, which were also filled with tears, I told him to go home and do his homework quickly, so as not to cause him pain. He lowered his head and walked out very quickly.

Sure enough, he could no longer go to school to study the next semester. Every night I taught him a little Chinese and arithmetic. During the day, he went to the streets to sell sweet potatoes and broad beans. Seeing that the semester was about to end, I didn't talk to his parents about sending him back to school the next semester. I knew that even too much sympathy could not replace the shortcomings of reality.

Recently, one evening, the child suddenly came in holding several textbooks in his arms, smiling and saying to me:

"Tomorrow, I'm going back to school, these are the new books."

I flipped through the new books and asked him how much the tuition was. He said:

"Dad said that the factory increased it by five cents a day, which is just enough for me to study for half a year, and my uncle paid the rest for me." The child revealed happiness when he said this. He poured out a few cooked broad beans from his pocket, saying that they were what he had left over from selling that day. Starting tomorrow, he won't be selling things, and these were given to me to eat, to thank me for teaching him for the past year.

I couldn't find words to say to him for a moment. Looking at the flat and large broad beans, I could only thank him. He seemed happy that I had received his affection and generous gift, smilingly told me to try them, and jumped and ran downstairs.

In the past two days, I have heard the sound of the child's reading again in the morning and evening. I get joy from the sound of reading, and I know that what his parents get is joy and comfort that exceeds joy.

### Begonia

— Qin Shouou

Xiangqi looked at her mother's gloomy face, which had almost wiped out all the joy of her graduating first in her class.

"But... but... can't... blame... your... father..." Her mother said with tears in her eyes, "He... copies... books... for... people... every... night..., often... copies... until... midnight... before... resting.... Recently, his... eyes... have... a problem..."

A wave of sadness suddenly surged into Xiangqi's heart, causing her to sob uncontrollably.

She remembered that when her father sent her to the women's normal school four years ago, he was wearing a ramie gown that was already two years old. But today, when he went to the women's normal school at Principal Hou's invitation, she clearly saw that he was still wearing this old gown, which was as yellow as amber, and had been torn in several places. The hardship of his life in recent years was enough to be explained by this gown. Four years ago, her brother was very robust, although he had been sent to a satin shop as an apprentice. But now? He has become a patient who often coughs up blood!

"Please rest for a while! When father comes back, there will definitely be good news." Xiangqi knew that her mother always had to sleep for one or two hours every afternoon - this was the only tonic she could get - so she tried her best to persuade her to temporarily forget all the pain and slowly close her eyes to sleep.

Xiangqi herself was still sitting on the edge of the bed, driving away mosquitoes for her mother while thinking deeply.

She began to blame herself! A few days ago, she really shouldn't have stubbornly refused the position as a tutor introduced to her by Principal Hou. If she had accepted it, it would at least make her mother feel more relieved now! (33)

### Rare Total Solar Eclipse

— Liu

The total solar eclipse on September 21st at noon (i.e. the first day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar) has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. A total solar eclipse is indeed a rare opportunity, because solar eclipses are common, but total solar eclipses have only occurred a few times in recent years, and they were all abroad. The total eclipse time is mostly up to five minutes, and at least one or two minutes, and what you see beyond this is not a total eclipse. Because the sun is large, the moon is small, and the earth rotates quickly, it passes in an instant, and not every place can see it. Foreigners record the scene of a total solar eclipse is very beautiful, but unfortunately China alone does not have such records. Judging from the records of solar eclipses in historical books, by inference, there are only two cases that are equivalent to a total solar eclipse.

(1) In the first year of Deyou of Emperor Gong of Song, on the first day of the sixth month Gengzi, there was a solar eclipse, and stars were seen, and chickens and ducks all returned, which is 1275 in the Western calendar, which can be determined to be a total eclipse.

(2) In the twenty-ninth year of Yuan Shizu Zhiyuan (1292 in the Western calendar), on the first day of the first month Jiawu, there was a solar eclipse, and something gradually invaded the sun. It could not be finished, and the sun looked like a golden ring, with lobes on the left and right, and an aura above.

This seems to be a ring eclipse. According to scientists' calculations, a total solar eclipse can be seen every 200 years in a fixed location, but on the day of the total eclipse, the sky must be clear and bright to be seen. Moreover, the shadow belt where the total eclipse can be seen on the ground is very narrow, so even in China, people outside the shadow belt will only see a solar eclipse, not a total eclipse. We only hope that victory will come soon, transportation will be restored, and we will be able to go to the total eclipse zone in China to appreciate it, which is a rare and joyful event.

### Tidbits

— Lili

I will be honest because they trust me.

Let me live in a house by the roadside, to be friends with mankind.

To young people I say, "Look at yourselves." You have to spend some time reflecting every day, and maybe you will find many shortcomings in yourself.

Don't leave a single dark spot on your bright mind, but keep a sacred record.

Reading the biographies of great men is another way to recognize yourself. Compare their lives with your own, and sometimes you will discover the truth from the comparison.

Arts and Entertainment World

New Movie Introduction

### "Spring Breeze Returns to Dreams"

— Mo Ye

Adaptation means re-creation, especially adapting a novel into a movie, which requires a process of refinement and extraction. Otherwise, the audience will be confused, and the director will only be able to spend more than half of the film on the introduction, which will become a mess. "Romance of the West Chamber" is one example.

Some people sigh that Shanghai film directors do not understand "montage" and tend to become comic strips. Undoubtedly, this is a fact. "Spring Breeze Returns to Dreams" managed to avoid these, but it did not highly utilize cinematic techniques. This can be said to be the biggest difficulty in adapting a novel.

Liu Yunruo is a strong general in the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies school. This work, which opposes the old ethics and describes the lives of young people under the feudal system, seems to be his progress. However, he failed to develop the very good subject matter into an anti-feudal theme. The biggest shortcoming of the movie is also the same. Movies aimed at the petty bourgeoisie, due to their lack of knowledge and unclear themes, often have counterproductive effects. Moreover, without a theme, it cannot become a work of art.

The directing technique is quite simple. However, several shots of Feng Rulian (Tong Yuejuan) singing drum Beijing opera are too lengthy and stagnant. The most successful part, I think, is the grasp of the rhythm, the strengthening of the atmosphere, and the proper setting of the camera angles. Such as: the wedding night; the Mid-Autumn Festival night; the scene of Li Fang (Li Hong) dying of illness, are all handled very well, which can be said to be tightly holding the audience's heartstrings. The guilt that should be borne is that it is not possible to find a way to emphasize the theme and highlight the theme.

The actors are also competent. Especially Li Hong, has a special performance and unexpected achievements. Since "Xi Shi" and other films, she has made a leap. Here, she shows the essence of the old woman under the feudal system, whether it is action or inner emotions, it makes people feel real.

Gu Yelu (as Lu Jingbao) did not perform badly, and was able to convey the character of the intellectual class, but at the end, he was not able to perform the inner contradictory psychology of "loving Rulian and pitying his wife". The habitual movements on the stage have been reduced a lot.

Due to her own rich life experience, Tong Yuejuan has the status of a female actor, but there are many places lacking emotion.

### Scattered Notes on the Art World

— Shou Wu

Xia Yan's "Heart Defense" will soon be performed in Chongqing by the "China Long Live Troupe" (said to be an organization of colleagues from the China Film Studio), directed by Zhang Min.

The famous cartoonist Hu Kao has entered Chongqing via northern Shaanxi and has reportedly joined the China Film Studio as a set designer.

Jin Yan and Wang Renmei may not give up their "profession" temporarily in Hong Kong.

Lu Ming recently sent a letter to a friend in Shanghai, mentioning that Shanghai newspapers said that he had come to Shanghai to shoot a film at Yihua, saying: "Even I don't know about this."

The Minhua Tongle Club decided to hold a performance after the filming of "Song of Ancient China". The repertoire is extremely "grand". "Killing the Family" has Yan Fei as the teacher, and Wang Yin, Shushi, Zhang Yi, and Liu Qiong as the little teachers. It is really a mighty and invincible lineup.

The filming of "Rejuvenation Incense" by the United Film Company (this incense is not what Yang Xiangwu has in Beijing Opera, but is adapted by Tu Guangqi based on "Di Si Niang", starring Ying Yin) will start on the 20th. It is now rushing to make costumes. This is the second film produced in the name of "Huacheng". It is said that the third film has been internally set as "Killing the Son for Revenge", starring Wang Xichun. Perhaps Wang Xichun is not playing the cruel woman who killed her son.

When the Film Association held its annual meeting this year, there was a "tidbit" that could be recorded: one was that Luo Xuelian, the head of the Central Photography Studio, and Dang Zhen, the head of the China Film Studio, kissed on the spot, and the other was that He Feiguang and Chen Tianguo quarreled. He also drew a gun and shot Chen, but fortunately did not hit him. Shi Dongshan, Ying Yunwei, and others persuaded them to stop.

### A Record of Female Sculptor Mrs. Bi Feiliefu

Russian female sculptor Mrs. Bi Feiliefu (Madame Pertilie) has been engaged in sculpture for more than 20 years. Her works are exquisite and noble and have long been famous in the overseas art world.

At first, Bi studied at the most prestigious academic research association in St. Petersburg and was a student of famous sculptors Chayermen and Lisixifumen. Because she was able to earnestly seek progress, she gained all the strengths of the two masters and had the reputation of being even better than her teachers. In 1926, Bi traveled far to Rome to seek further study. She practiced at the Rome Academy of Fine Arts for ten years, and her name gradually became known. She held an exhibition at the 94th National Academy of Fine Arts Exhibition in Rome in 1928, and also held exhibitions in 1929 and 1932. There are countless other individual exhibitions. Bi is especially specialized in making bronze busts.

### Talking About "Selling the Horse"

— Jing Ying

"Selling the Horse" is a popular play that almost every famous actress has performed in the past decade. Many people only know this play as a Kunqu Opera, but it is actually a Chuichang Opera. The easiest way to distinguish between Kunqu Opera and Chuichang Opera is that Kunqu Opera does not have interludes, while Chuichang Opera does. Therefore, this play was not considered a formal opera in the early years.

It is said that Zhu Lianfen was extremely famous for this play in the early years. Wang Guiguan was also very good before he switched to playing young male roles. Zhu Youfen and Chen Delin have also performed it, but "Selling the Horse" was not popular for several years. Its current popularity is due to Mei Lanfang. I know there are several versions of this play. One was self-written by Gai Jiaotian, another was performed by Gui Junqing in Shanghai, and the third is the common version of Gui Zhi writing a petition and the three reuniting. Gai Jiaotian's version is his own creation. It starts with Li Qi selling horses. Li Qi is dressed as a horse trader from Guandong, fully equipped with real knives and guns, portraying Li Qi as generous and righteous, making many friends. One day, he sees injustice on the road and accidentally kills the son of an official. The authorities arrest him urgently. Li Qi bids farewell to his friends, takes his wife, and flees back to his hometown. He later has a daughter (Gui Zhi) and a son (Bao Tong). More than ten years later, his wife dies. Because there is no one to manage the household, he marries a widow, Madam Yang, from the neighboring village. The following part connects to the version performed by Gui Junqing: Li Qi's old friend invites Li to go outside the pass to sell horses. Li cannot refuse, so he bids farewell to Madam Yang and his children and leaves. After Li leaves, Yang has an affair with the local bailiff, Tian Wang, which is discovered by Bao Tong. Madam Yang plots to drive Bao Tong and Gui Zhi away. Bao Tong jumps into the river and is rescued by a fisherman, who adopts him as his godson. Gui Zhi searches for her brother without success and attempts suicide in the forest. Li Qi's good friend, Liu Zhiquan, passes by while collecting debts and saves Gui Zhi, adopting her as his goddaughter and renaming her Liu. Liu has a fellow student, Zhao Rongsen, who brings his son, Zhao Chong, to visit Zhiquan. Liu sees that Chong has handsome features and promises Gui Zhi to Zhao Chong. With the help of his godfather, Bao Tong goes to the capital to take the imperial examination. Zhao Rongsen dies of illness, and his second wife treats Zhao Chong badly. As the examination date approaches, Chong borrows travel expenses from his uncle Liu. Li Qi returns from selling horses. Zhao Chong marries in Liu's house, and after the wedding, he takes Gui Zhi to the capital. Li Qi returns home and asks about his children. Madam Yang claims they are dead. Li Qi knows something is wrong and tortures the maid Chunhua. Chunhua is in a dilemma and hangs herself. Tian Wang and Madam Yang plot to bribe the authorities, falsely accusing Li Qi of forcing Chunhua to commit suicide. Li Qi is forced to confess under torture in court. Zhao Chong passes the examination and is appointed magistrate of Bao Cheng County. Bao Tong passes the imperial examination and is bestowed the title of Imperial Inspector of Eight Prefectures. Zhao Chong goes to the countryside to promote agriculture, followed by the common versions of crying in prison, examining the prisoner, writing a petition, filing a lawsuit, breaking into the yamen, and the three reuniting. The best performances I have seen are by Mei Lanfang, Cheng Jixian, Zhang Chunyan, Jiang Miaoxiang, Xiao Changhua; Cheng Yanqiu, Bai Yunsheng, Zhang Chunyan, Gu Juesun, Cao Yigeng, Han Shichang, Bai Yunsheng, Wei Qinglin; Zhu Chuanming, Ye ShengLan, Zheng Chuanjian, Zhou Chuanying; and Xin Yanqiu, Yu Zhenfei, Zhou Xinfang, and Han Jingui. Among them, Cheng Yanqiu's Gui Zhi is the most satisfying, followed by Mei Lanfang. Zhu Chuanming, Han Shichang, and Xin Yanqiu are a bit lacking. Cheng Jixian's Zhao Chong is excellent except for his voice and appearance. Bai Yunsheng is lively, Yu Zhenfei is refined, Ye Shenglan is delicate, and Jiang Miaoxiang is also good at playing Zhao Chong, but I think he only has a scholarly air and nothing else. Wei Qinglin's Li Qi has good expressions and voice; Zheng Chuanjian has spirit but lacks voice; Zhou Xinfang and Zhang Chunyan also have the same problem as Zheng Chuanjian. Gu Juesun is very competent as Li Baotong. Han Jingui's Hu LaoYe is too fiery, Cao Ergeng has a mercantile air, and Xiao Changhua is okay.
