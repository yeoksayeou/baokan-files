### Chairman Chiang Declares that If Japan Advances South or North, China Will Launch a General Counter-Offensive. The War Disaster Spreading Across the World Was First Initiated by Japan. Countries Opposing Aggression Must Thoroughly Cooperate in Spirit and Help Each Other.

Chongqing: In his address to the nation yesterday on the fourth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, Chairman Chiang stated that China would launch a general counter-offensive if Japan advanced south or north to attack Siberia. This address by Chairman Chiang was separate from his messages to friendly nations. Chairman Chiang said, "Militarily, Japan is now not only determined to intensify its invasion of China, but also wants to risk advancing north or south, regardless of the possible consequences. Japan is likely to begin an offensive to the south or to turn and attack to the north. In any case, we will not miss this double opportunity to launch a general counter-offensive against the Japanese." (8th United Press Dispatch)

Chongqing: Chairman Chiang issued a message to friendly nations, stating three points: (1) This war disaster spreading across the entire world was first initiated by Japan. (2) The key to victory or defeat in the war lies in whether the forces opposing aggression can be extended in Asia. (3) Countries opposing aggression must thoroughly cooperate and help each other in spirit. (6th Dispatch)

Chongqing: Zhou Enlai, the representative of the Communist Party stationed in Chongqing, yesterday urged all patriotic organizations in China and all anti-aggression countries in the world to unite closely. In an article published in Xinhua Daily, Zhou advocated for improving China's military equipment to prepare for a general counter-offensive. He also urged the government to implement a democratic system in the country. (8th United Press Dispatch)

### Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Message to Friendly Nations

Chongqing: On the fourth anniversary of the War of Resistance, Chairman Chiang issued a message to friendly nations. The original text is recorded below: China's war against Japan has been going on for four full years. At the beginning of the war, we recognized that if acts of aggression were not swiftly curbed, they would not only endanger China's survival but would also bring immense disaster to the world. Therefore, we resolutely rose up to engage with the aggressors, without regard for gains or losses. Over the past four years, through arduous struggles, we have achieved results. However, China has been prepared to fight independently to the end from the beginning. Furthermore, we deeply believe that the strength of China alone is sufficient to prevail, provided that friendly nations fully provide us with weapons and economic assistance. Then victory can be achieved sooner, and the world can be spared from catastrophe. The Chinese nation understands the cruelty of war most deeply and desires that no country should suffer from war. Therefore, although we know that the aggressors' goals are definitely not limited to China, we never hope that any country will join the war. If justice can be upheld and humanity can be spared from disaster, then the sacrifices made by the Chinese military and civilians will have value. This is what Zhong Zheng (Chiang Kai-shek) has repeatedly stated, and it is also what friendly nations have commonly seen and heard. Over the past year, both the Far Eastern situation and the world situation have undergone drastic changes, and in recent weeks, the evolution has been particularly rapid. The coordinated response between the Axis countries and Japan has clearly divided the world into two major camps: the aggressive group and the anti-aggression nations. Today, the flames of war in the Far East are no longer just a war between China and Japan, and the European war and the Asian war are also interconnected and have formed a very close relationship. Looking at the global situation, hardly any country can remain outside the war. Since the aggressive group has fully revealed its true face to the world, any country can sooner or later become the target of its fierce offensive. War is like a flame; the fire that burns the plains must have its source. If all countries today sincerely want to avoid war, they must extinguish the flames of war. If they sincerely want to reduce the disaster of war, they must take preemptive measures. Here, there are three essential points that I would like to present to my friendly nations: First, what we call the flames of war must have their source. And the war that is about to engulf the whole world was not other than the Japan's September 18 Incident, when it sent troops to invade our country's territory. The Anti-Comintern Pact of 1935 further encouraged the aggressive forces to deliberately disrupt the world. In the past year, it first colluded with Germany and Italy to form the Tripartite Pact, and then announced the slogan of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," formally declaring that it included what it called "Oceania." On the one hand, it moved its naval invasion base to Hainan Island and Vietnam. Therefore, tracing the course of the world war's planning and expansion, Japan is the source of the world war, not only the initiator of the East Asian war. If this aggressor is not defeated, the world war will have no end, and humanity will never have a peaceful day. This is the first point that our friendly nations should recognize. Second, the victory or defeat of the war hereafter will depend solely on whether the anti-aggression forces can extend in Asia. Asia's population and material resources are the greatest in the world. If the democratic countries of Asia, America, and Europe jointly gather under the banner of anti-aggression and cooperate closely, then democracy will surely prevail, and violence will surely be eliminated. In today's Pacific, friendly nations concerned must often change their ideas, shift their vision, and confirm that the importance of the Pacific is no less than that of the Atlantic, and that Asia's current position is even more important than that of Europe. It must also be recognized that the more serious the situation in Europe, the more urgent it is to curb Japan's aggressive forces. China's four years of hard fighting are to fulfill its sacred responsibility for both its own country and for humanity in the world. For the sake of its own future in the world, each friendly nation should also first sanction this initiator of the world war, and then use the joint forces of Asia, America, Australia, and Africa to achieve a complete solution to the European war. Conversely, if one still hopes that Japan will have any awakening, and thus indulges Japan, then one will surely repeat the mistakes that friendly nations made against Germany in Europe. Furthermore, if one believes that today's Japan can still be distinguished from Germany and Italy, and that one can first assist one and appease the other, then the consequences will be even more unimaginable. I believe that any friendly nation will definitely not stand idly by and watch the war in Asia today, so that one day the flames will eventually spread to itself and there will be no time for regret. This is the second point that each friendly nation should recognize. Third, now that the division between aggressive nations and anti-aggression nations is extremely clear, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan have formed a group and launched aggressive actions, and all countries that love peace and freedom are also forming an anti-aggression front. We firmly believe that the total strength of the anti-aggression nations is far greater than that of the aggressive countries. However, in the life-and-death struggle ahead, all friendly nations that oppose aggression must cooperate thoroughly, help each other sincerely, and not focus on small or near-term interests, and not have any misgivings. They must seize the time, seize the initiative, and go further to take preemptive attacks. In this way, there is no doubt that the final victory will belong to us. It is true that the actions of aggressive nations can no longer be inferred with common sense, thinking that the goals of attack still have a sequence of priority. One must know that what they consider urgent and prior has already been annexed without exception. And what remains now is only their last taste of the cauldron. For example, regarding the current movements of the Japanese, some people think that they must specialize in advancing south, some think that they must advance north, and some think that they have no real strength to carry out both south and north advances at the same time, but only concentrate their efforts on advancing west to invade China, in order to achieve their goal of resolving the Sino-Japanese war. However, what they do not know is that as long as there is an opportunity to take advantage of, there is a gap to seek, then they will take risks in any direction. Moreover, they will definitely use the long-standing mentality of democratic countries to seek temporary ease and hesitation, and imitate Germany's blitzkrieg offensive. Especially today's war between the Soviet Union and Germany is a good opportunity for them to advance both north and south. If they do not launch a preemptive attack, then no matter north or south, how can there be any possibility of success by chance? If the politicians and military strategists of the anti-aggression friendly nations do not understand this meaning, then it will give the world and humanity the most serious impact. This is the third point that each friendly nation should recognize. Finally, I would also like to tell each friendly nation that the Chinese people will never forget the assistance that each friendly nation has given to China. China's friendly nations and neighboring Soviet Union, as well as the United States in the Western Hemisphere, and the United Kingdom in difficult circumstances, have been continuously providing us with various assistance since the beginning of the war. This has truly excited the Chinese people and the fighting army. The Chinese government and people will never betray the sympathy and assistance of friendly nations. At the beginning of the war, I said that this war is a war between good and evil, right and wrong, a war between justice and aggression and violence. There is no doubt that justice will prevail. However, in order to shorten the time of the war and reduce the sacrifices of the world's humanity, we must also urgently rise up and catch up to promote the early collapse of the aggressive forces. From now on, China and its friendly nations will work together to fight. President Roosevelt's declaration that the four freedoms that humanity in the world must enjoy will eventually be universal throughout the globe. China is now fighting a life-and-death battle with Japan. The significance of this battle is not only to eliminate the violence of aggression. China must seek to contribute to human civilization and welfare in the free world of the future. This is the determination of the Chinese military and civilians, and I am pleased to announce it.

### He Yingqin Discusses China's War Strategy: Defeating the Japanese Army with Self-Reliance. Any Changes in the World Situation Will Not Have a Negative Impact on China's War of Resistance.

Chongqing: Minister He Yingqin recently issued a summary of the fourth year of the War of Resistance. The conclusion is recorded below: Looking at the fourth year of the War of Resistance, it is sufficient to see the increased strength of the Chinese army in combat. Except for the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain and a few places along the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang, almost every battle, large and small, can be said to have been victorious. In particular, the Battle of Central Hubei quickly defeated the attacking Japanese army. The Battle of Southern Henan completely shattered the large-scale offensive of the Japanese army. The Battle of Shanggao gave the Japanese army a heavy blow with equal forces. Therefore, it was able to ensure the battlefield, protect the vast land in the rear, engage in production and construction, and allow the troops to rotate for training and move towards the goal of building the army. Conversely, the Japanese side was unable to maintain its acquired battlefields. Therefore, in the Guinan area, they finally retreated. We must know that the second phase of the War of Resistance is different from the first phase. In the first phase, in order to disperse and consume the Japanese army's forces and make it easier for the Japanese offensive to reach its peak, it was natural to sacrifice space. In the second phase, space should be maintained to deal with the Japanese army. In particular, in the fourth year of the War of Resistance, it is even more necessary to maintain the strongholds for future counter-offensive. Therefore, in the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, it is regrettable that some mountain passes and several ferry crossings were lost. However, the Chinese army did not give up the entire Zhongtiao Mountain and most of it turned to the rear of the Japanese army. Zhongtiao Mountain can be said to still be under the control of the Chinese army. The offensive strongholds in all other battlefields are all secured in the hands of the Chinese army. Therefore, the overall situation is not unfavorable for future advances. In the fourth year of the War of Resistance, in addition to ensuring the battlefield, especially ensuring the offensive strongholds for the future, the Chinese military's focus on continuing to consume the Japanese army has not been relaxed in the slightest. The entire battlefield prevented the Japanese army from moving at any time and place. Therefore, the number of battles from June 29 to the end of May 30 totaled 6,762, large and small. Except for a few major battles, almost all of them were launched by the Chinese army. Therefore, during this period, the Japanese army suffered another 336,200 casualties. If combined with the casualties of the previous three years, the total is about 2 million. Since the start of the war, the Chinese army and people have been fighting hard. In the first half of the 28th year, shortly after the start of the second phase, the foundation for victory had already been laid. After the outbreak of the European War in September 28, several European countries were defeated in a short period of time, causing the war to spread and the flames of war to spread throughout Europe, and even to Africa. However, in East Asia, China fought independently, not only making the situation increasingly favorable, but also forming a stable force in East Asia. Now the European war is expanding day by day, and the East Asian war may also expand along with it. However, China's war plan has always been based on self-reliance to defeat the Japanese army, and this plan has always been consistent and unwavering. Therefore, no matter how the world situation evolves, it will not only have no adverse impact on China's War of Resistance, but also enable China to make more contributions to the future of the world. From this point of view, the significance of China's War of Resistance is becoming more and more significant. It has progressed from a war to safeguard national independence and freedom to a war to safeguard world human justice and peace. When we started the War of Resistance four years ago, our national defense preparations were indeed inadequate. Today, four years later, the reason why we have been able to create the above situation is all due to the arduous and outstanding spirit of our great leader and the blood and sweat of the military and civilians of the whole country. Now that victory is in sight, how should all our Chinese nationals go a step further to strive for the glorious achievements that can be realized soon, so that they will not be unworthy of the ancestors of all generations and the descendants of future generations. However, in the fourth year of the War of Resistance, unfortunately, the Fourth Army of the New Fourth Army disobeyed orders, did not obey dispatch, deliberately disrupted the battlefield, and destroyed the battle line, resulting in the order to disband by the General Headquarters on January 17 of the 20th year, which is the most painful thing. I deeply hope that such facts will not happen again in the future. Not only that, but in this critical period, I hope that every member of the country can put the country and the nation first, and contribute all that they have without hesitation. Because today, in order to win the final victory, the so-called "country above all else, nation above all else, military first, victory first" are the creeds that everyone must follow, and there is no room for hesitation. Yingqin is willing to encourage the people of the country together. (6th Dispatch)

Editorial

### The Struggle Between Justice and Violence

At the end of the First World War, the slogan "Right Prevails over Might" left an indelible mark on human history. The so-called "might makes right," a common product of militarism and national exaggeration, was also abandoned by the public and tended to disappear. Unexpectedly, twenty years later, Hitler and his Nazi organization inherited the mantle of Kaiser Wilhelm II of the former German Empire, causing another world war, believing in force above all else, and fantasizing about realizing the dream of conquering the entire world. In terms of Germany's own strength, it is definitely not comparable to the beginning of the First World War, but for more than a year, it has been able to fight without defeat, creating the general illusion that violence seems to be able to control the entire world. No matter how we examine it from any aspect, the fundamental reason undoubtedly lies in the failure of China, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to cooperate in the early stages of this war. When the German-Soviet war broke out, and Britain and the United States quickly declared their full support for the Soviet Union, the final fate of the collapse of violence was also announced at the same time. The entire world situation in the future depends only on how the countries resisting aggression cooperate and how to deal with the post-war world. As for the final total collapse of the aggressive forces, it is no longer a problem now. Without mentioning other things, just taking resources as an example, for a country that occupies a corner of Europe, Asia, and Africa to confront the total union of the remaining parts of the world, I am afraid that no one who claims to be a "superman" can definitely think of a clever plan. At the same time, we cannot ignore the difficulties on the road to total cooperation of the forces of justice, because even a moment of carelessness may still be destroyed by the violent ones one by one, plunging the world into long-term suffering. Therefore, on the one hand, we should firmly believe in the joint and complete victory of the forces of justice, and on the other hand, we should strengthen the cooperation of the forces of justice. These two points are major issues that China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are currently seeking to use consistently and quickly to achieve success. They are also what anyone who cares about the future of human civilization should strive for.

The process and situation since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war have provided significant explanations and empirical evidence for all of the above. This can be divided into two aspects.

In terms of military affairs, under the personal supervision of Hitler, almost all the forces that Germany could mobilize to the Eastern battlefield were concentrated to launch a fierce attack on the Soviet Union. For half a month, they only advanced to the old border of the Soviet Union before the Polish war in 1939. According to the official Soviet announcement the day before yesterday, within twelve days after the start of the German-Soviet war, the German side suffered losses in terms of people and materials that were far greater than the losses suffered by Germany in twenty-two months of fighting with Britain, France, and other countries. Even if the numbers in this estimate are not completely accurate, it generally shows the unprecedented scale of this war. If this kind of protracted war continues, it is doubtful how long Germany's resources can allow it to continue. The Soviet Union's strong reserve military strength and abundant resources are a fatal blow, especially to Germany's illusion of a quick victory. In contrast, Germany's military strength has already reached its peak and is following a downward path; on the Soviet side, its main force is now only continuously heading to the front. Then, the advantages and disadvantages of the situation on both sides are very obvious. What's more, there is also the cooperation and assistance of Britain and the United States to the Soviet Union! According to the recent estimate published by the British "News Chronicle," in the current situation of joint efforts between Britain and the United States, the British air force has technically achieved an advantage over Germany, and the quantitative advantage will soon be achieved. In the past month, while Germany was dealing with the East, the British air force launched a large-scale bombing, which not only caused great destruction to Germany's rear and industrial center, but also fully exposed the weakness of the German air force's absolute inability to cope with two-front warfare.

In terms of politics and diplomacy, the activity of anti-aggression countries and the helplessness of the Axis countries and their allies have also presented a very obvious contrast in the past ten days. Roosevelt, Hull, Welles, and others in the United States, Churchill, Eden, and others in Britain, and even Stalin in the Soviet Union, who has not spoken much to the outside world, have repeatedly declared one after another that they will fight the Nazis and fascists to the end. As for the strong expression of the highest authorities in China, it goes without saying. Looking at the Axis countries and their allies, not only can they no longer launch any diplomatic tricks to the outside world, but even within the country, the two dictators of Germany and Italy seem to have lost the courage to incite from the past this time. Until now, in addition to the usual publication of a so-called revelation of a Soviet conspiracy by the German propaganda department, Hitler has still not been heard to explain his latest adventurous move. As for the unprecedented distress and anxiety of their eastern allies, it has reached its peak in these days. The biggest reason for this, in addition to the brightness and darkness of their own future, which of course affects the fighting mood, is that the fundamental truth is still difficult to erase. This truth is that the violence of violence will eventually be destroyed, and the human forces of justice can finally be combined and live forever. In the face of it, all institutional differences, racial prejudices, and various self-calculations of gains and losses will slowly disappear, and all the forces of justice in the world will gradually join hands to engage in the crusade against violence. One day in the future, even the people of the aggressors' own countries will wake up and participate in this sacred mission. When the aggressors' external adventures suffer a fatal blow, their internal control will probably reach its end. The dooms of Napoleon and Wilhelm II in history are probably the lessons of Hitler and Mussolini.

### Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing Again Yesterday; British Embassy Completely Destroyed; All Buildings Destroyed and Cannot Be Used as Offices, Documents Moved Earlier and Not Damaged

Chongqing: During this morning's air raid, the British Embassy was hit by two bombs and completely destroyed. One bomb directly hit the main building of the embassy, the study of the British ambassador. The other bomb fell on the lawn. Fortunately, the documents had been moved earlier and were not damaged. The British Embassy has two buildings in total. One was the residence of Sir Blackburn, which was destroyed in the air raid on June 28. The other building was repaired and completed, but was also bombed today, leaving the embassy with no place to work. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing: Japanese planes attacked Chongqing on the 19th of last month, and part of the British Embassy was destroyed. Counselor Backhouse and Secretary Allen and his wife were seriously injured. The British government has protested to Tokyo. On the 7th, when Japanese planes attacked, many bombs fell on Lijiia Garden. The private residence of British Ambassador Sir Kerr was even shaken and destroyed, causing considerable losses. It was learned on the 8th that Japanese planes concentrated bombing on Consulate Lane, directly hitting the British Embassy. Foreigners in Chongqing suffered a lot of damage to their property and cultural and charitable organizations. (8th Dispatch)

### Reporters' Hotel Also Bombed

Chongqing: This morning, 27 Japanese planes bombed the lower town of Chongqing and the banks of the Yangtze River in the western suburbs. There were several fires in the lower town, which have not yet been extinguished. When the reporters' hotel was heavily bombed last night, the houses where the offices of New York Times reporter Du Ting, London Times reporter Smith, and Christian Science Monitor reporter Stan were located were completely destroyed. The company's dining room, messenger's house, and doorman's house were also completely destroyed by fire. What remains now is only the outer shell of the company's main building. All doors, windows, walls, and roof were bombed and destroyed. It was heard that during last night's air raid, the residence of British Ambassador Kerr was severely damaged. Bombs fell near the house, and the roof was blown away, but the four walls remained standing. The ambassador's residence is located in the mountains in the western suburbs. It has been damaged in previous air raids, but this time it was the most severely damaged. (8th Reuters Dispatch)

Chongqing: Thirty-five Japanese planes attacked Sichuan in three batches from Hubei province at 6:00 am on the 7th. The first two batches, totaling 28 planes, arrived in the city at 8:00 am and were concentratedly fired upon by Chinese anti-aircraft artillery. More than 100 bombs were dropped in the urban area, shaking and destroying many civilian residences and shops. The third batch of nine Japanese planes flew from Qianjiang to Zhongxian, and then began bombing. The damage is still unknown. Again, at about 6:00 pm, 19 Japanese planes attacked Sichuan from Hubei province. The first batch of seven planes and the second batch of three planes entered the suburbs one after another and dropped incendiary bombs, bombing and burning several civilian residences. Many residences of foreign reporters were damaged, and the Wenhua Bookstore was also bombed and destroyed. As for the third batch of nine Japanese planes, they flew into the city's airspace and dropped bombs in the eastern district, but many of them did not explode, so there were very few casualties.

### Soviet Troops Launch Full-Scale Counteroffensive, German Advance Halted, Attempt to Cross the Dnieper River Fails, Two German Infantry Regiments Completely Annihilated

Reuters, London, 8th: Recent Soviet communiqués state that all German attempts to cross the Dnieper River have been repelled and severely damaged. On Monday evening, fierce battles raged around Ostrov, Polotsk, Lyubavichi, Bobruisk, Novograd-Volynsky, Pogorelsky, and Ukraine. German troops are now resisting the Soviet counteroffensive in the Polotsk and Bakovichi areas. Soviet forces have destroyed 35 German heavy tanks in the Bobruisk area and decimated two German infantry regiments. In the Novograd-Volynsky area (both cities are 150 miles west of Kyiv), Soviet forces are resisting enemy tank, motorized, and mechanized units with intense fighting. Further south, Soviet forces are counterattacking the German flanks and rear, annihilating two infantry regiments. The Soviet forces in Maginov-Podolsk and Ukraine are fiercely resisting German attempts to cross the Dnieper River. On Monday, the Soviet Air Force shot down 58 German aircraft, losing 5 of its own.

TASS, Moscow, 8th: The Soviet Information Bureau released an early report on the 7th, stating that from the night of the 6th to the morning of the 7th, battles continued in the Ostrov, Polotsk, Lyubavichi, and Novograd-Volynsky sectors, with little change in the overall situation. In the Ostrov sector, enemy motorized and mechanized units repeatedly attempted to break through the northeastern border but were repelled by our forces, and enemy tank units suffered significant damage. In the Polotsk sector, fierce fighting raged throughout the night as the enemy attempted to seize the Chabratanae River, but they were repelled and suffered heavy losses. In the Lyubavichi sector, our counterattack against the enemy's motorized and mechanized units forced them to adopt a defensive posture. In the Novograd-Volynsky sector, battles are still ongoing. During the night, enemy motorized and mechanized units repeatedly attempted to break through our positions but were repelled. In Bessarabia, the enemy suffered heavy losses and was forced to retreat to its original positions. Elsewhere, there were only local battles and outpost activities during the night. On the 6th, our destroyers defeated enemy warships attempting to enter the Gulf of Riga, sinking several enemy destroyers. An enemy submarine was destroyed by a mine at the entrance to the Gulf of Finland.

United Press, Moscow, 8th: Moscow Radio announced that Soviet tank units launched a terrible and fierce counteroffensive in Ukraine, with large-scale engagements resulting in the destruction of 300 German tanks, the capture of 12 German long-range artillery pieces, and the capture of 500 German soldiers.

Haitong Press, Berlin, 8th: German engineers attacked the Stalin Line yesterday, capturing many new types of obstacles. The structure is extremely solid and well-protected, making it invisible even from a few meters away. However, due to the skilled tactics of German engineers, it was breached. The German troops then advanced, and the defenders behind the obstacles were mostly annihilated.

United Press, Stockholm, 8th: Yesterday, a radio broadcast from Latvia was received here, stating that southern Estonia is under German control. It also stated that German troops have reached Lake Peipus and have thus invaded the Leningrad war zone.

Reuters, London, 8th: Today's German radio news stated that German advancing units have reached the Stalin Line along a vast front line and have broken through several points. German troops have now crossed the upper reaches of the Dniester River. Among the defenders in a Soviet artillery position captured by the Germans were eight women.

### German Losses Heavy in Less Than Two Weeks of Fighting

Reuters, Moscow, 8th: Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs and Director of the Information Bureau, Lozovsky, stated yesterday in response to questions that the Soviet government is determined not to give the German troops any respite. The front line is no longer straight but rather a large, twisted shape, with mobile troops fighting in between. Any German unit that stops for even a moment is immediately counterattacked. For example, a column of German tanks stopped due to lack of fuel and was immediately set ablaze by Soviet troops using petroleum, destroying many German tanks. Lozovsky also stated that German losses in these two weeks of fighting are heavier than in the 22 months of the European war. The German side admitted that before the Soviet-German war, German casualties were 300,000, while the British estimated the total to be 900,000. Let us take the middle ground and assume the total to be 600,000. However, in the 12 days since the German invasion of the Soviet Union, casualties have reached 700,000, and the fighting is becoming increasingly fierce, with casualties increasing daily. The British estimated that the German side lost 4,500 aircraft and 2,000 tanks in the previous 22 months. Now, according to Soviet announcements, the Soviet side has destroyed 1,500 German aircraft and 2,500 tanks in just eight days. As for Soviet casualties and the number of troops mobilized, he was not at liberty to announce. It is said that seriously wounded Soviet soldiers are now being transported to Moscow for surgery, while lightly wounded soldiers are being sent inland for treatment. Lozovsky also stated that the number of Soviet men is three times that of Germany, so although women are actively engaged in various jobs, they are not being organized into women's battalions as the German side claims. The evacuation of children from Moscow is done with the consent of their parents and is not enforced. Every household in Moscow has one air defense officer and fire-fighting equipment, with many household air raid shelters reaching depths of 50 yards. Lozovsky concluded by saying that the difference between Hitler and Napoleon is that the latter reached Moscow, while Hitler can only be satisfied with looking at photos of the Kremlin. With the German troops harassed by Soviet guerrilla warfare and facing increasingly fierce resistance, the German people will soon realize that the task Hitler has given them is impossible to complete.

### Nazis Encounter a Formidable Enemy, the War Situation Favors the Soviet Union

Reuters, London, 8th: A Reuters military commentator stated that while the latest news from the Soviet-German war does not indicate that the Soviet troops have won, it is already advantageous to the Soviet side. This Soviet-German clash may be the most significant battle in world history, and the scale of the front line, the number of soldiers, and the weight of equipment are almost unprecedented. Now, not only the fate of the Soviet Union but also the fate of all countries in the world, including the Americas, depends on the outcome of the Soviet-German war. This is because Hitler wants to control the world and enslave all the people of the globe to 80 million Germans. The Soviet-German war is the culmination of total war. All kinds of modern weapons and men that the German General Staff could muster have been used in the war without reservation in an attempt to destroy the enemy quickly. However, the Soviet military strategy is also based on total war, which is fortunate for the Soviet Union and its allies. The Soviet Union's large-scale preparations are now evident, and the Soviet Union also knows that fighting against the enemy's large army also relies on manpower. Relying solely on the effectiveness of aircraft, tanks, and artillery is not enough to ensure victory. Therefore, it is now mobilizing a well-equipped large army to fight. Furthermore, the Soviet Union also seems to know that the "modern concept of deep defense" does not mean merely building scattered outposts and fortresses in the deep rear and taking a purely defensive stance. Today, those who take the offensive use powerful motorized units to break through enemy lines, with large groups of infantry following closely behind, launching large-scale encirclements. The only way to deal with this kind of offensive is to use equally powerful reserves to counterattack the enemy's vanguard. The result of a major battle is that those who have an offensive spirit and use large groups of aircraft, tanks, and artillery can win. The United States seems to be determined to put this principle into practice. If one studies the front line in detail, it can be seen that the northern German-Finnish troops have neither occupied Moshaysk nor seized the railway line to the south. The German claim a few days ago that they had occupied the railway line to the south is probably not true. The German troops attacking in the Karelian Isthmus have made no progress. This is quite important because if the German troops there were to advance, Leningrad would be threatened, and the German side would also have to deal with the (impact) of the American fleet. The German troops south of the Gulf of Finland, from the northeast through Estonia, have also launched fierce attacks on Leningrad. Halting the German offensive on this route is extremely important. The Soviet Union now shows signs of knowing this danger, so it is concentrating sufficient troops not only to halt the German troops but also to drive them back. In the south, on the banks of the Berezina River and the Dnieper River, the Soviet troops are also launching counterattacks, demonstrating their offensive spirit. Regarding the fact that a large German army is gathered on the Soviet front line, British military officials should inquire about how many soldiers and aircraft the German side currently has stationed in northern France, the Netherlands, and Norway, and what the strength of the German army in North Africa is. The real question now is not how to defend Egypt but how to defend Cyrenaica and Libya. British politicians have made bold statements, and now the time for launching bold actions is approaching.

### Soviet Reserve Troops Mobilized, Ukrainians Rise Up

United Press, Moscow, 8th: Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs and Director of the Information Bureau, Lozovsky, announced that millions of Soviet reserve troops are now being mobilized for combat at an unprecedented rate. All able-bodied people from the ages of 17 to 55 are being called up, which will greatly reinforce the regular Red Army.

TASS, Kyiv, 8th: In response to Stalin's call, Ukrainian peasants, workers, students, and scientists have unanimously and voluntarily joined the volunteer army to defend the resources of Greater Ukraine and annihilate the enemy.

Havas, Berlin, 8th: The radio station here recently announced that the German troops have penetrated an average of 250 to 300 miles into Soviet territory.

### Soviet Guerrilla Units Active, Harassing the German Rear

TASS, Moscow, 8th: According to the Italian news agency Stefani, guerrilla units are launching special organized attacks on the rear of the fascist army, engaging in various activities such as destroying warehouses, blowing up fields, and slaughtering livestock. Foreign radio also reported that a German train carrying military supplies was blown up in eastern Poland.

TASS, Moscow, 8th: According to the German Information Bureau, guerrilla activity in the German rear is very intense. Recently, convoys transporting food to the German front lines have been repeatedly attacked by machine gun fire, and the cargo carriers have been annihilated by guerrilla units.

TASS, Moscow, 8th: Several captured German soldiers reported on the situation of guerrilla activities. A soldier named Hans Schmidt, who was captured by our reconnaissance unit, described the difficulties of transporting fuel to the front lines, saying that every clump of soil and every small forest had guerrilla units. The German military could only send large numbers of tanks to protect the transportation, but even then, deaths could not be avoided. As soon as the tanks passed, the guerrilla units opened fire on the trucks, killing the drivers and setting the oil tankers on fire. Their attacks were impossible to prevent, and the tank crews were unable to cope and could only fire bullets into the deep forests. Hans Schmidt also said that German soldiers all tried to avoid traveling at night.

### Red Army Resists Firmly, Minsk Turns into Scorched Earth

Reuters, London, 8th: According to Soviet Electra News, Stalin's strict order for Soviet soldiers and civilians to implement a scorched-earth policy is now being carried out. The Swiss news agency's Berlin message stated that Soviet troops have completely destroyed Minsk in order to prevent the German troops from stationing there. German newspapers also reported that the German troops, who had been camping in the open for nine days, had hoped to find a place to stay after occupying Minsk, but as a result, they found the city in ruins and full of Soviet raiding soldiers, which greatly disappointed them.

TASS, Moscow, 8th: The harvest and food of the people in the Soviet-occupied areas have been plundered by the German fascist troops, and their livestock have also been handed over to the troops. Local farmers have burned warehouses and fields and tried their best to prevent grain from falling into the hands of the fascists. As for those who were unable to withdraw with the Red Army, they have joined guerrilla detachments, causing great difficulties for the German troops.

### Hungary Aids Germany in Attacking the Soviet Union, Reaching the Dniester River

Reuters, London, 8th: The Hungarian military headquarters issued a communiqué last night stating that on Saturday and Sunday, the Hungarian troops flanked the enemy troops, and the mechanized divisions in particular performed well. In some places, Hungarian troops advanced on the east bank of the Dniester River.

Reuters, London, 8th: A German communiqué stated that German troops have repelled the Soviet counterattack in Bessarabia and are continuing to advance. (The) troops in the Bug River area have reached the upper reaches of the Dniester River and occupied Senovizi in the Galician region. Battles continue on the vast front line east of the Seles River (between Lviv and the Ukrainian border).

### The Strengths and Weaknesses of Soviet and German Tanks Are Clear, Germany Even Uses Wooden Ones

Reuters, London, 8th: A reporter from the Swiss New Sulek newspaper in Berlin wired after inspecting Lviv that Soviet tank weapons greatly surprised the German side, even experts. The giant tanks used by the Soviet army weigh 60 tons and are manufactured after French tanks. Each tank has three turrets, equipped with one howitzer, two light cannons, and several machine guns. They are invincible in battle, but they are easily trapped in muddy terrain. Soviet artillery vehicles and tanks are also well-designed. Books on education were found in the Soviet retreat positions. In a prisoner-of-war camp built by the German side that could accommodate 5,000 people, there were only 3,000 captured Soviet fortress-building soldiers, many of whom were Asian. The resistance of the general Soviet soldiers is very strong. When they are forced to retreat, they are also orderly, without abandoning materials or equipment.

TASS, Moscow, 8th: A group of Red Army scouts, led by Lieutenant Shabuchenko, was conducting reconnaissance on a highway in the enemy rear when they saw a team of enemy tanks advancing. Shabuchenko observed them with military binoculars and discovered that of the 20 enemy tanks, only one was real, and the others were made of wood, covered with canvas, and mounted with machine guns. At night, these fascist detachments were crushed.

### Litvinov Will Broadcast to the Nation

Reuters, Moscow, 8th: Former People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov will broadcast to the nation tonight. Since leaving his post two years ago and being succeeded by Molotov, Litvinov has remained completely silent until now.

### Rice Purchased by Meters Should Be Sold at the Original Limited Price, Those Ordered Starting Yesterday Will Be Subject to the New Limited Price, Freight Will Increase by 15 Shillings Per Ton, All Parties Hope That the Authorities Will Charter Ships for Self-Transportation to Maintain the Original Agreement

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement announced yesterday that the selling price of imported rice is 116 yuan per stone (160 catties net weight), which is a maximum of 6 yuan higher than the previously set price. However, according to reporters from Ping Ming She, the rice should still be sold at 110 yuan. As for the rice that rice shops obtain from the Lichiji Foreign Firm starting yesterday, the new price can be calculated. The price increase is due to the sharp increase in shipping costs from Rangoon to Hong Kong and from Hong Kong to Shanghai, which has increased costs. The shipping companies originally planned to increase the freight from 95 shillings to a minimum of 120 shillings, but after mediation by the Municipal Council, it was decided to be 110 shillings, which is an increase of 15 shillings.

New Price for Those Who Apply Starting Yesterday

After the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement announced on the 8th that the door-to-door selling price of Hong Kong rice would be increased to 116 yuan per stone, it also notified Lichiji Foreign Firm and Xiangmao Foreign Firm yesterday morning to comply with the following measures: (1) Starting yesterday, all grain shops in the city will be allowed to apply to the authorities for the purchase of affordable Hong Kong rice again, with a minimum quantity of 500 tons. (2) The price per bag (224 pounds) will increase from 128 yuan 7 jiao 6 fen to 135 yuan 0 jiao 5 fen when sold by the Municipal Council to the rice shops, or when sold by the grain shops to the rice shops, the price per bag will increase from 137 yuan to 141 yuan 5 jiao, which is a general increase of more than 6 yuan. Therefore, the door-to-door selling price will also increase by 6 yuan per stone. However, rice purchased previously should still be sold at 110 yuan. It is unreasonable for those who have already changed the price to 116 yuan.

Hoping the Authorities Will Charter Ships for Self-Transportation

However, food for the people is related to life. The hard-earned income of the lower and middle classes is mostly spent on rice, let alone other things. Moreover, once the price of rice is high, the price of everything else will inevitably increase accordingly, and the pressure of life will inevitably increase. In the future, if the pond is drained to catch all the fish, social panic will occur, which is an inevitable trend that cannot be avoided. Since the Municipal Council's main goal is to relieve food distress, it should try to charter ships for self-transportation or negotiate with shipping companies to specially reduce the freight costs for transporting this imported rice, in order to permanently maintain the original limited price of 110 yuan as the minimum. If they follow the trend and increase the price as the freight increases, speculators will take the opportunity to spread rumors in the market, which will immediately affect the market. This is not the original intention of promoting and relieving food distress.

Dock Workers' Strike Under Mediation

Since the strike by dock workers in the soybean, rice, and grain industry in the city on the 3rd of this month due to the failure to demand improved treatment and increased rice subsidies from the management, it has been a week. Yesterday morning, Jiang Shiqing, Cheng Ruifa, and Yin Jingxin went to the Soybean, Rice, and Grain Industry Association to petition, requesting that negotiations be held on a regular basis. However, it has been found that although there are many people involved in this strike, it is not as serious as rumored. Moreover, the dock workers used by the rice and grain industry are still working as usual, as the treatment is mainly based on commission, and the income is considered to be generous, so there is no need to adjust it. The strike is currently being mediated by Jiang Hongbin.

### The French Electricity Company Decides to Enforce Clear Rewards and Punishments

Due to frequent labor-management disputes over the years, the French-owned military vehicle company must seek harmony between labor and management in order to develop the business and improve production efficiency. Although previous strikes have been resolved through mediation, the company has suffered losses. Recently, the workers again demanded that the management implement the previous conditions, which was eased after the assistance of the French Concession Political Department in mediation. It is understood that the labor side has requested the management to quickly announce the conditions for worker rewards and punishments. The company authorities have already formulated these conditions and submitted them to the highest authorities of the French Concession for review and record. It will be announced this week.

### The Four Banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong Have Not Reduced Interest Rates

Recently, some commercial banks in the city have reduced deposit interest rates due to the excessive amount of floating capital and the difficulty in lending, in order to stabilize business and save expenses, which has been reported in the newspapers. However, according to reporters from Da Tong She, the Four Banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong are still calculating the interest rates on depositors' deposits at the original rates and have not reduced them.

### The Electrical Workers' Strike Shows Signs of Resolution

The strike of about 600 electrical workers at the Meter Hess脱 Road Telephone Company, which began on the 3rd of this month, has now been going on for a week. It is learned that three arrested workers, Zhu Haijin and Dong Shangqing, were released by the authorities yesterday. It is also learned that in order to resolve unnecessary disputes, the labor and management of the company have agreed to start negotiations at 10:00 am today. The management will send Wo Yongtang as a representative at that time. The company hopes that the labor side will resume work, and all terms will be negotiated step by step. Therefore, the labor-management dispute of the company may be resolved satisfactorily in the coming days.

### There Is a Great Demand for Shanghai Goods in Southeast Asia, Good Quality and Lower Prices, Japanese Merchants Are Greatly Alarmed

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post stated that, according to the Japanese Kobe Shimbun newspaper, Shanghai exporters are currently dumping products in Southeast Asian regions such as Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies markets, causing Japanese exporters to suffer considerable losses.

Shanghai products, especially daily necessities and groceries, are not only cheap but also of good quality. Therefore, markets in various parts of Southeast Asia have a great demand for Shanghai products and are unwilling to purchase Japanese products. Moreover, the exchange rate in Shanghai is also favorable to overseas merchants, who would rather import goods from Shanghai and Hong Kong than purchase them from Japan, which is only natural. It is said that the cheapness of labor in Shanghai and Hong Kong is quite astonishing. In addition, the technical skills provided by Jews make the products extremely cheap. The development of the hosiery industry in Shanghai in recent years can be described as rare, and the general quality of socks is far better than that of socks made in Japan. This situation is probably irreversible for Japanese exporters.

### British Public Buses Increase Fares Again, With an Average Increase of 65.54%, The Municipal Council Approved Implementation Starting on the 14th

Regarding the issue of fare increases for public vehicles in the International Settlement of the city, the fares have been raised repeatedly, which has caused dissatisfaction among the citizens. Regarding trams, it was previously reported that fare increases would be implemented starting on the 28th of last month, but the company has temporarily stopped the fare increases.

Company Reasons

The Information Office of the Municipal Council issued a statement stating that the Bureau had previously received a submission from the Chinese Public Bus Company stating that since the fare schedule was approved for modification in December of last year, the prices of all commodities have risen sharply. In addition, the subsidies issued to employees have also been quite large, resulting in a sharp increase in the company's expenses, making it difficult to cope. The company had to request a fare increase to increase revenue and make up for the deficit. According to the company, the cost per mile in January and February of this year increased by 360.4% compared to the period from January to July 1937. However, the proposed fare revision is only about 300% higher than that implemented during that period. If it were not for the fact that the increase in the number of passengers slightly alleviated the company's financial difficulties, it would be difficult to maintain operations even with a fare increase.

Bureau Resolution

The case was submitted to the Bureau's Public Utilities Committee for discussion and was thoroughly studied the company's financial situation and the necessity of raising fares. As a result, it was recommended that the average fare increase be approved at 65.54% within a maximum range of 1 jiao 5 fen per mile. It has been submitted to the Board of Directors of the Bureau for approval and will be implemented starting on the 14th of this month. It is found that public vehicles have raised their prices repeatedly, and revenues and expenditures can also be low, but now instead of thinking about openly and secretly embezzling bus tickets, the increase in car prices only increases the burden on passengers. If the encroachment of tickets is as before, the company will not see any real benefits.

### Yu Qiaqing Spends Summer in Hong Kong, Will Go to the Mainland After Autumn Cools Down

Recently, this newspaper received a letter from Mr. Yu Qiaqing from Hong Kong, stating briefly that since leaving Shanghai, he had traveled to various places in eastern Sichuan and the northwestern region of the mainland, and after three months of traveling back and forth, he returned to Hong Kong last week to escape the summer heat. After the autumn cools down, he will go to various southwestern provinces, planning to enter the southwest via Singapore and Rangoon from Little Luzon, or via Shannan Xiong, Shaoguan, and Weiyang. It is not yet decided. He has served the society for sixty years and should go to the mainland for inspection. The northwest is rich in products, but they have not been developed, which is a great pity. The time to return to Shanghai cannot be predetermined.

The President Pierce Steamer Will Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow
The Last Voyage
Will Sail to San Francisco the Day After Tomorrow to Await Dispatch Mr. and Mrs. Perside Will Return Home on This Steamer
A Large Amount of Medical Supplies from the American Red Cross Will Be Shipped This Month

The President Pierce, a mail ship of the American President Lines, originally scheduled to return to America from Little Luzon via Hong Kong and Shanghai, was supposed to arrive today. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the company announced that the mail ship failed to depart from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, so it cannot arrive in Shanghai today. News came today (yesterday) that it had left Hong Kong for the north. If the information is accurate, it should arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon.

There are a Thousand Bags of Mail to the United States

The date of return to the United States will also be postponed to the 11th, when it will leave Shanghai and sail to San Francisco. It may call at Japanese ports along the way. After arriving at the designated location, it will be subject to orders from the U.S. Navy Department and will no longer come to Shanghai. It is said that cargo space is very tight. In terms of mail alone, the Shanghai Post Office has about a thousand bags of mail to be sent to the United States or transshipped through the U.S.

Mr. Perside Reluctant to Depart

Mr. Perside, president of the Shanghai branch of the American Red Cross, has submitted his resignation due to his advanced age. The resignation has been approved by the headquarters, and Mr. Anderson will succeed him. Mr. Perside is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Pierce of the American President Lines and return directly to his hometown of Seattle. Mrs. Perside will accompany him. Before Mr. Anderson takes office, Mr. Carter will temporarily take over the duties of the Red Cross. According to Mr. Perside, although he is retiring and returning to his country at an advanced age, he has lived in China for more than 30 years and is very familiar with the situation in various parts of China. In the future, he will work harder to appeal for refugees and provide more material assistance to China to comfort the refugees.

Two American Ships to Arrive in Shanghai Together

The American cargo ship Ole Lai, with a deadweight of 2,976 tons, has been ordered to sail the Far East route and will arrive in Shanghai this Friday from New York via Los Angeles and San Francisco with cargo. Its sister ship, Natty, with a deadweight of 2,977 tons, will follow and arrive here with cargo on the same route on the 19th of this month. According to a spokesman for the U.S. Navy Department, the United States not only wants to protect its fortified areas in both oceans, but also to fully maintain trade routes in both oceans, so that American ships still sail between the Far East and the Pacific.

Public Bus Company Dismisses Workers
Workers Demand Reinstatement
Company Refuses Mediation, Negotiations Break Down Authorities Hope to Prevent Escalation

All the workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company are indignant because the company has successively dismissed more than 30 workers since May. The workers believe that the reasons given by the company are insufficient. For example, ticket seller No. 87 lost ticket money and was willing to compensate, but the company insisted on dismissing him. Driver No. 501 asked for leave due to lung disease, but the company refused to extend the leave and announced his dismissal. Driver No. 128 was falsely accused of assaulting a ticket inspector and was dismissed. Therefore, all the workers were very angry and jointly petitioned the Industrial Department of the Public Works Department, demanding that the company revoke the dismissal of the workers who were dismissed for no reason and allow them to be reinstated. After the Public Works Department tried to mediate, the company agreed to reply at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. At that time, the company rejected the workers' demands, believing that the reasons for dismissing the workers were sufficient. Therefore, the mediation broke down. All the workers held a meeting that night to discuss countermeasures. It is reported that the authorities are trying their best to persuade the workers and agreed to continue to mediate to avoid escalation. The workers have accepted the persuasion.

Otomemaru Plans to Carry Passengers to Ningbo
Blocked by the Japanese Navy

The Japanese-owned Dongya Shipping Company previously dispatched the Yangtze River ship Otomemaru to operate the Shanghai-Ningbo route (Shanghai to Ningbo). For a month, there have been several unofficial voyages. At first, it only carried cargo and not passengers. Later, passengers were allowed to come to Shanghai from Ningbo. Now it is heard that passengers can also take the ship from Shanghai to Ningbo, but the procedures are extremely complicated. You must first obtain a pass, and the date of the ship must be inquired from the company at any time. The ship is docked at Laobaidu, Pudong, and you must take the company's small ferry to the Laobaidu Wharf to board the ship. Passengers are inconvenienced by such twists and turns. The ticket prices are divided into first, second, and third class. First class is 24 Japanese yen, and third class is 8 Japanese yen. The ship returned to Shanghai from Ningbo on the 30th of last month. It was originally scheduled to go to Ningbo at 5 p.m. on the 5th of this month, but it was unexpectedly blocked from leaving the port by the Japanese Navy. As of last night, it had not been seen sailing to Ningbo. It is said that it will sail to Ningbo tonight, but it is not yet certain whether the Japanese Navy will allow it to sail.

Ningbo Plague Has Not Been Eradicated

Since the recurrence of the plague in Ningbo, it has been almost a month. Due to stricter inspections in the urban area, it has not spread significantly, but the plague germs have not been eradicated. According to people from Zhejiang, the plague has recently been found in Qu County and has spread to Guangze, Shangrao in Jiangxi, and Yong'an in Fujian. Fortunately, the local authorities quickly took prevention and control measures, and there was no major disaster. The current health department has sent specialists with a large number of medicines to various places. Because it is summer, if it is not eradicated fundamentally, there are many dangers.

The Public Works Bureau Further Maintains Morality and Order

The Public Works Bureau recently issued a notice stating, "Any event that is immoral or detrimental to public order, or that may disrupt public order and good order, will not be allowed to be advertised. Violators will be prosecuted according to law."

Cars are Often Stolen in This City
Someone is Behind the Scenes
The Stolen Cars are Driven to Hongkou and Then Transported to Nanjing for Sale

According to news received yesterday, the cars that have been stolen in various places in this city in the past few months have now been found in a car dealership near McGon Road in Hongkou. The car dealership is opened by a Japanese person and employs Russian and Korean people to manage the duties. According to an investigator from a car insurance company in this city, the discovery of

Stolen Cars

The process is as follows: On October 19, a businessman's car was robbed by three armed thugs on Yidingpan Road in western Shanghai. At that time, although the driver was forced to get out of the car, he still managed to follow the car until a car rental company in Hongkou. He then reported to his master. The car owner went to look for the car according to the address and found that the stolen car and fifteen other cars were all in one place. At that time, the car owner saw that the car's license plate and keys were lost, so he reported to the Special Police Department and sent someone to investigate the car dealership. It was then learned that the car had been

Robbed by Thugs

Sold to a Japanese person, and the Japanese person instructed the car dealership to send the car to Nanjing. At the same time, 13 of the 15 cars stored in the car dealership have been transported to Nanjing. The Special Police Department then instructed the car owner to contact the Japanese Military Police Department. It is reported that the case is now being handled by the U.S. Consulate in this city and will be discussed with the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai in the next few days. At the same time, the insurance companies in this city also plan to draw up a list of all the cars that have been stolen after being insured by them, so as to negotiate with the Japanese.

Will Japan Invade Vietnam?

The Continental News has commented on Japan's impending southward advance, stating that Japan is preparing to make another adventurous attempt to the south, and there is now increasing evidence of this. The island nation takes advantage of complex international environments to fish in troubled waters. Now that the Soviet-German war is in full swing, it is trying to obtain more benefits. Tokyo is considering where to invade.

Japan Has Many Concerns About the Three Countries

The outcome of World War II is still unclear, and Tokyo does not want to offend the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union too much. The Japanese Consul General in Vladivostok recently stated that the Soviet Union's national defense in the Far East has not been relaxed due to the events in the West, and the Red Army has taught the Japanese army a lesson in the Battle of Zhanggufeng. Therefore, although Japan is very interested in invading the Soviet Union, it has to wait for the right time.

The Target of Invasion Seems to Be Vietnam

Today, Japan believes that the easiest place to invade is French Indochina (Vietnam). Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Matsuoka have stated that Japan's actions do not want to oppose the Soviet Union. At the same time, Japanese newspapers have stated that they do not want to invade the Dutch East Indies, fearing retaliation from Britain and the United States. According to a United Press Tokyo dispatch, Japan has reduced its foreign shipping in preparation for its southward advance. It is reported that some Japanese ships will be rerouted to Dalian. If Japan attacks Vietnam by force, Japanese ships will be requisitioned.

Domestic Opinions Are Still Divided

However, Britain has expressed deep concern about this attempt. Foreign affairs reporters from the London Times and the Daily Mail have reported on this news one after another. What they have not learned is the steps taken by Japan, because domestic opinions in Japan on the southward advance have not yet become consistent. Japan is mired in China, becoming more and more deeply involved, and has been severely hit by the previous war against the Soviet Union. It is now in a very difficult situation and is also uneasy about Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union. It plans to take rapid action to invade Vietnam in order to obtain Germany's renewed guarantee.

Afraid of Failure, Changed Course

We know that an invading country can never be quiet except when it changes its direction of aggression from time to time. An invading country can only survive if it is based on permanent victory. Otherwise, it will be in a stalemate with the invaded country. This is the failure of the aggressor. Japan is now in such a position, so it must invade other countries again.

Another Meaning is to Win Hearts

Due to Vichy's mismanagement of Vietnam, it cannot obtain assistance from Britain and the United States when its colonies are invaded. Therefore, what Japan seeks day and night is to invade Vietnam. If Japan can occupy the area, it can wait for an opportunity to make a bigger adventure. If not, the Japanese people will not forgive their government's "automatic" withdrawal of some troops stationed in China.

Cooling Off in Front of the Door, Suddenly Shot to Death
Hua Gang Shot in the Head and Chest

In front of the door of No. 9, Lane 82, Bailinan Road (Jide Lane), western Shanghai, a man named Hua Gang (from Anhui, 37 years old) was cooling off in front of the door when he was suddenly shot twice by a man with a gun. Hua Gang was caught off guard and was shot in the head and chest. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely and dying. He was taken to Tongren Second Hospital by ambulance, but he died before arriving at the hospital due to injuries to vital organs.

The Iron Gate in Nanshi Opened Yesterday
Two Bombing Cases Occurred

The iron gate on Minguo Road, Fanshie Bridge, leading from the French Concession to Nanshi, was closed on the morning of the 7th. It was opened at noon and closed again after 5 p.m. due to a bombing in Nanshi. Many people living in the Concession or Nanshi were stranded in the Concession and Nanshi. The gambling dens were also deserted due to martial law. It was not opened until yesterday morning. The iron gates of Xinkaihe, Dongxinqiao, Nanyangqiao, and the Bund were reopened, restoring traffic. At 8 p.m., Shandong Xinqiao, Nanyangqiao, and the Bund were closed first as usual. The Xinkai River was closed as usual when martial law was imposed at midnight. As for Shie Bridge, it was not opened all day yesterday. Pedestrians and vehicles detoured through Nanyang Bridge. The French police still sent many detectives to search pedestrians and vehicles at the iron gates.

Two Bombing Cases

Ping Ming News reported that two bombing cases occurred in Nanshi in the early morning and afternoon of the day before yesterday. One was the headquarters of the Japanese Military Police on Xicang Road, which was recorded in the newspapers yesterday morning. The other occurred at 6:30 a.m. the day before yesterday. The place bombed was the Nanshi Police Station of the Japanese Consulate on Fangxie Road. It is reported that a Chinese man threw an explosive device made from an empty cigarette can of "Da Qian Men" into the station. It landed on the left chest of Takahashi, a Japanese patrolman in the station, and then fell to the ground without exploding. At that time, Takahashi went out to inspect, and the bomber had disappeared towards Minguo Road.

Strict Search

According to the Japanese side, the empty can was filled with yellow gunpowder and iron filings. If it exploded, the loss would be great. Afterwards, the Japanese side cut off traffic in the Fangxie Road area and conducted a search. However, at about 5 p.m. that afternoon, the headquarters of the Japanese Military Police was bombed again. Therefore, the Japanese side believed that the situation was serious and closed all the iron gates connecting the French Concession of Kunlian until 9 a.m. yesterday, when a part of them were opened. However, strict searches were carried out on residents entering and leaving, and it did not stop until the evening. It is reported that many young people suspected of being suspects were arrested by the Japanese.

Forged Passports Sentenced to Death

The Shanghai Times reported that Yu Peiqing (transliteration), a Chinese man, 24 years old, and Hua Yingshan (transliteration), a silk broker, 52 years old, were arrested by the Japanese army for forging passports and epidemic prevention certificates in the names of the Shanghai Special Service Department of the Japanese Army and the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee and selling them in the occupied area. The Japanese military authorities here accused the two of disrupting the security of the occupied area and sentenced Yu Peiqing to death and Hua Yingshan to five years in prison. It is reported that the two men forged and sold thousands of passports and epidemic prevention certificates. The passports were sold for 40 cents to one yen, and the epidemic prevention certificates were sold for 15 cents. Hua sold fake passports on behalf of others and earned 50 Japanese yen.

The Japanese Arrested Three Chinese Released After Finding No Evidence of Crime

At about 6 a.m. yesterday morning, the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, together with the personnel of the Public Concession Patrol House, suddenly went to the intersection of Xinza Road and McGon Road to arrest three Chinese men. After investigation, the arrested persons were Chen Zhenchao, the owner of Minghua Pharmacy (30 years old, from Cixi, Ningbo), and the small owner and shop assistant of Qinghe Pawnshop. After being taken to the patrol house for interrogation, it was found that the three men were not guilty and were released separately.

Thieves Arrested in Hua Sheng Gambling Den
The Key Criminals Who Robbed the Da Xin Company Fled After Hearing the News Only His Wife Was Captured

At about 10 p.m. last night, the Public Concession Patrol House sent detectives to take cars and go to the Hua Sheng gambling den at No. 2060 Haige Road, Xujiahui, to arrest the bandits. It is said that the bandits were the major thieves who robbed the Da Xin Company on Nanjing Road last year. However, when the patrol house and Japanese personnel entered to arrest them, the thieves had already fled after hearing the news. Only a woman was arrested. It is said that she was the thief's wife and has been taken to the patrol house to await trial. At that time, when the detectives rushed in, the pistol held by the Japanese personnel suddenly went off, and a stray bullet hit the right face of Gao Wang (29 years old, local), a passerby, who was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by ambulance.

British Old Man, Donner, Accused of Manslaughter
Setting Up a Machine Gun Accidentally Kills a Gardener The British Consulate Court Sentences Him to Four Months in Prison

The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that a British citizen named Saena, in his sixties, lives on the Western Boundary Road of Shanghai. Recently, he has often been harassed by petty thieves. Therefore, he set up a trap behind the small house and tied a rope to it, which was connected to the outside of the door. If a petty thief touched the rope, it would trigger the gun and fire a bullet, intending to scare away the petty thief. Unexpectedly, the gardener, Gao Guangzong (transliteration), went to repair the garden and accidentally touched the rope. A bullet was fired and hit Gao's body. He was sent to Baolong Hospital and died. Donner was then charged in the British Consulate Court. The Consulate Judge Jones held a hearing on the case today (the 8th) and sentenced Donner to illegally killing the gardener and intentionally injuring the body with a gun, sentencing him to four months in prison. Donner pleaded guilty. The defendant's lawyer, Jones, argued that it would be unfair to severely punish the defendant, because if everyone had tried their best to save the gardener after he was injured, he would not have died. The defendant came to court and expressed his heartfelt regret. He has already pleaded guilty, and the defendant is 67 years old and has lived in Shanghai for 30 years, and is highly respected. Therefore, he asked for a light sentence. After Donner retired, he planted flowers and composed music to pass the rest of his years. Because his residence was often stolen, he appealed to the Public Concession Police, but the police said that his residence was outside the jurisdiction and could not be controlled. Donner was forced to set up a gun. The caliber of the gun was very small, and his intention was only to scare away the petty thief. According to the death certificate issued by Baolong Hospital, the gardener died of pneumonia and peritonitis. The gardener died at 1 a.m. He had just had an operation and was walking in the ward, which was very important for his death. The lawyer asked for leniency again. Judge Jones replied that the defendant's actions were the cause of the gardener's death and sentenced him to four months in prison. The punishment cannot be too lenient.

Argentine Gambling Den Continues to Exist
The French Society Secretly Induces Gambling

The "Shanghai News" reported that the Western Special Police announced yesterday (the 7th) that the gambling den upstairs in the Argentine nightclub on Hague Road would be closed last night. However, according to those who frequented the Argentine nightclub, the gambling den was still open early this morning (the 8th) and the gambling business has not declined. According to the Special Police yesterday morning, the movement to close the foreign gambling dens in the Western District to eliminate gambling and drugs will be carried out step by step. Now, all other gambling dens have been closed, leaving only a few foreign gambling dens. It is reported that if the gambling den upstairs in the Argentine nightclub is closed, the nightclub itself will not be sealed up. According to foreign news, it has been recently established that a secret gambling den has been set up upstairs in the French dance hall Earanse on Daxilu Road, Western Shanghai, to induce people to gamble and make profits.

The den suffered heavy losses and could not be maintained and closed the next day. But now it is heard that it has continued to open. It is also heard that there is another Argentine gambling den that has been ordered to stop several times, but there is still no sign of closure.

Request for Compensation for the Loss of Car Sales The Plaintiff's Appeal is Rejected

Wu Ruisheng, the owner of Ruida Trading Company at No. 603, Jialing Building, Sichuan Road, purchased a Nash car from Datong Automobile Company on Jing'an Temple Road in March last year. He had a warranty issued by the company stating that it could be repaired free of charge within three months from the date of sale. On August 13 last year, Wu planned to transfer the car for 1,300 US dollars, but Datong Automobile Company refused to transfer the car because the warranty had expired and was invalid, which led to the failure of the transaction. Although the car was sold later, it only fetched 1,000 US dollars. Wu therefore demanded that Datong Automobile Company compensate him for the loss of 6,068.71 yuan in national currency. He filed a lawsuit in March this year. The First Special District Court ruled to reject the plaintiff's lawsuit. Wu Ruisheng refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal. It is now heard that the case was announced on the 7th of this month by Judge Han of the Second Branch of the High Court sitting in the civil court. The main text stated that the appeal was rejected and the appellant was responsible for the litigation costs of the second instance.

Pretext for the Public Works Bureau's Increase in Rice Prices All Rice Follows Suit Not Considering That the Rice Merchants' Rice Has Not Increased in Freight

Foreign rice prices have been gradually rising for several days, and the market situation is gradually tense. Yesterday, due to the exchange rate shrinkage and high production costs, the pricing was called high. The Public Works Bureau's publicly sold small-pattern rice also increased by six yuan, from 110 yuan to 116 yuan, which was then used as an excuse for new hoarders to raise prices and for cargo owners to bargain. The market has risen, and it is justified. The price soared, once increasing by three or four yuan. At the highest time, No. 1 Saigon opened at 135 yuan, No. 2 at 128.5 yuan, and small-pattern rice at 129.3 yuan. Afterwards, many floating households who had made profits took advantage of the high prices to sell, and the actual sales of the countryside in the mainland were still suspended. Only the streets were moving, and the rising wind was suppressed. It was repeatedly changed to more sales than purchases, and the situation became weak. The prices fell back. The result of the statistics for the city was a tight and weak market, which was still more expensive than the previous market. The opening and closing prices were 132-133 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 127 yuan for No. 2, 122-123 yuan for small bags, 133-134 yuan for Mintang, 126-127 yuan for No. 2 Siam, 127.5 yuan for small-pattern rice, 99 yuan for broken rice, and then to 96.5 yuan. The original package of public-sale small-pattern rice was 156.5 yuan, and the road cargo of Siam No. 2 was also from 148 yuan to 149 yuan. The total daily transaction was 25,000 bags of existing rice and 1,500 tons of British and Chinese Company rice.

It is said that the market price of foreign rice has already risen by six or seven yuan to more than ten yuan. The public-sale rice has only increased by six yuan to this day, which is still more than ten yuan lower than the market price. Therefore, the market price should not take the public-sale price as an excuse to follow up and increase. The public-sale price is increased due to the increase in freight. The rice traded on the market has already arrived in Shanghai and has not been affected by the increase in freight. It should not be increased because the Public Works Bureau's rice price is increased. There is absolutely no reason for it and it should be banned.

Thick and thin japonica rice and domestic rice, its source is due to seasonal relationship, the fresh early and late rice in Nanhang is especially rare and therefore, yesterday, under the attention and competition of the local shop stomachs, the situation continued to be popular, and the market rose by more than two yuan, sold at 146 yuan, 145.5 yuan, compared with the old 140 yuan, while the market price of Wuxi original-packed old japonica rice also increased by one yuan, but the way out was ultimately worse, with a count of 133-134 yuan, then to 131-132 yuan.
