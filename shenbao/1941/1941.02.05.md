### The Chinese Government Agrees to Gauss's Appointment to China; Gauss Has Extensive Contacts and Sympathizes with China's Resistance; Johnson's Appointment as Australian Minister is a Self-Requested Transfer

Chongqing - It was officially confirmed today that the US government's appointment of Gauss, the first minister to Australia, as ambassador to China, replacing Johnson at his request, has been approved by the Chinese government. Meanwhile, Chinese newspapers here also began publishing news of this matter today, stating that Gauss will soon leave Australia for Chongqing. The Chinese newspapers also stated that Gauss has extensive contacts in China and sympathizes with China's resistance. Officials at the US Embassy here said they have received news from the State Department in Washington regarding the transfer of Johnson, but before Washington officially announces the appointment of Gauss as ambassador to China, they are unwilling to comment on the matter, adding that Ambassador Johnson has not yet considered leaving Chongqing or his future plans. By October, Ambassador Johnson will have completed twenty-five years of diplomatic service in China. From 1929 to 1930, he served as minister to China, and in 1935, he was promoted to the first US ambassador to China. Sources in Washington said that Ambassador Johnson will likely switch positions with Gauss, but it is said that Johnson has served in the diplomatic service for thirty-three years and may retire. Observers in Washington believe that the United States consulted China and Australia regarding the Johnson and Gauss matter, following normal diplomatic procedures. Such a position swap is rare in history, as Johnson will be taking a lower position with a salary reduced from US$17,000 to US$10,000. The current US ambassador to China, Philips, also moved from ambassador to Belgium to minister to Canada, but that was when the United States began establishing diplomatic relations with an important neighbor. In 1937, Gudah from Poland was transferred to the legation in Ireland. Before being appointed minister to Australia last year, Gauss served as consul-general in Shanghai and is one of the most senior members of the diplomatic service. Gauss began serving as vice-consul in Shanghai in 1907 and served continuously in China for four terms, holding positions such as counselor at the embassy in Peiping, representative, and counselor and consul-general at the embassy in Shanghai. He also served in the State Department for a year and as counselor and consul-general at the embassy in Paris. On January 8, 1940, President Roosevelt nominated Gauss as minister to Australia, which was soon approved by the Senate. Gauss's appointment came after the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Australia. Johnson first came to China in 1907 as a trainee interpreter and is one of the most widely traveled members of the diplomatic community in China. Apart from serving as head of the Far Eastern Affairs Section of the State Department from 1918 to 1921 and as Assistant Secretary of State from 1927 to 1929, Johnson has remained in China since 1907, serving in consulates in Shenyang, Harbin, Hankou, Changsha, Chongqing, and Shanghai.

Chongqing - Although no official news has been received from Washington regarding the rumored transfer of US Ambassador to China Johnson to Australia, Reuters learned from US sources here that Johnson requested the transfer because his wife and children could not live with him in Chongqing as a result of the State Department's order to evacuate American women and children from the Far East. It is said that Washington suggested sending Johnson as ambassador to South Africa or Australia, and he reportedly preferred the Australian position. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

### Japanese Troops Land in Dapeng Bay, Attempting to Cut Off Traffic Between Hong Kong and Shaoguan; Danshui Repeatedly Bombed by Japanese Aircraft

Hong Kong - According to reliable sources here today, Japanese troops landed at several locations in Taipeng Bay this morning and are advancing along the Hong Kong-Shaoguan highway towards Danshui. Danshui was heavily bombed yesterday and this morning. The defending forces in Danshui are very thin, and its fall is imminent. Military observers said that the purpose of this move by the Japanese army is to cut off traffic between Daya Bay and Shaoguan. (International News Service dispatch, 4th)

Tokyo - The Nichinichi Shimbun's Guangzhou dispatch stated that Japanese troops, under the cover of warships, suddenly landed southeast of Huizhou in eastern Guangdong this morning. The purpose of this landing is to cut off the route from Hong Kong to Shaoguan, as it is said that this route is the most important supply route for China. Chongqing relies heavily on this route because the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is closed, and the Yunnan-Burma Road is also very difficult. Meanwhile, another Guangzhou dispatch from the Japanese side stated that Japanese forces have stepped up the blockade of waterways in southern China. The Chinese side secretly transported a large quantity of military supplies from Hong Kong to Huizhou via Shayuchong. (United Press dispatch, 4th)

Guangzhou - A Japanese military spokesman announced today that Japanese land forces in South China, together with the navy, landed at a certain location in Mills Bay (transliteration), southeast of Huizhou, at 5:30 this morning, in an attempt to cut off the highway from Hong Kong to Shaoguan. He also said that since the beginning of the year, Japanese forces have destroyed 65 Chinese trucks, 182 civilian boats, 500 packages of goods, 20,000 cans of gasoline, 15 warehouses, and several railway stations. According to Japanese sources, the Chinese army is not expected to put up significant resistance when Japanese troops cut off the highway. Goods from Hong Kong are currently transported to Shaoguan via the highway, where the headquarters of General Yu Hanmou, deputy commander of the Fourth War Zone, is also located. After Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam bombed the Yunnan-Burma Road from Tokyo and Japan from time to time, China's transportation has been greatly inconvenienced. The cars and gasoline needed are all transported to the mainland via this highway, so this highway is quite important to China. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

Editorial

### The "Lend-Lease Act" Under Discussion in the US Congress

January 10, 1941, is a day worth commemorating in history! On this day, US President Roosevelt, together with eight congressional leaders, five government officials, and the chairman of the National Defense Commission, held an important meeting to discuss the Lend-Lease Act. This is a plan of epoch-making significance. According to this plan, the United States will aid China, Britain, Greece, and other countries resisting aggression to achieve victory. After this summit meeting, Senator Barkley and Representative McCormack presented the bill for discussion in the Senate and House of Representatives, respectively. It has been more than three weeks since then. During this period, on the one hand, the entire United States has concentrated its efforts on exploration, and on the other hand, the democratic countries resisting aggression have appealed. Countering this, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan have desperately threatened and obstructed. How the world situation will unfold in the future is undoubtedly a major pivot.

Roosevelt once said in his fireside chat that the most fundamental significance of all current work in the United States lies in turning the United States into the "arsenal" of all democratic countries. We recall that before the outbreak of the European War, he also issued a solemn warning to the two dictators of Germany and Italy, urging them to resolve all disputes peacefully with Britain and France at that time; otherwise, after the outbreak of the war, it would inevitably drag a country even larger than the combined forces of Germany and Italy into the whirlpool of war. This time's "Lend-Lease Act" is the follow-up to that warning, the practice of the "arsenal" promise; and at the same time, it also pushes the United States to the edge of actual participation in the war.

Looking at the debates and opinions from all aspects of the United States over the past three weeks, it seems that the first focus of the dispute lies in the question of whether it is necessary or not. Powerful figures who support this bill, such as the new Vice President Wallace, said: "If Germany wins, its first step against the United States will be a large-scale economic war, and after that, it will immediately be military aggression." Former Ambassador to France Bullitt said: "Unless the United States immediately aids China, Britain, Greece, and other countries, the United States will one day be invaded by Germany." Former Ambassador to Britain Kennedy said: "The British authorities feel that the assistance the United States is giving them is not reaching the level they expected." Under such powerful opinions, the "Lend-Lease Act" has safely passed the first hurdle of necessity or not, which means that it is extremely necessary!

The second point of discussion is the legal issue. The biggest reason for the opposition is that it violates "neutrality" and conflicts with the principles of international law. However, the supporters immediately gave a strong reply: The biggest problem facing the United States today is the life and death of itself and other democratic countries. If we still bring up the principles of international law at this time, it would be equivalent to helping Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the result would be enough to promote its own destruction. For example, Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Secretary of War Stimson have all made strong statements on this point. So far, the reasons of the supporters of the "Lend-Lease Act" have completely defeated the so-called "neutrality" of the isolationists.

The third focus of discussion is the issue of restricting the powers of the President. On this issue, the opposition can be roughly divided into two viewpoints: one is represented by Hoover, Dewey, and others, who unconditionally oppose the passage of the "Lend-Lease Act" in the position of political enemies of Roosevelt, believing that in that case, the United States has actually become a dictatorial country, and the President is the dictator. The other opposition is from Roosevelt's own party, and their reason for opposition is based on an assessment of Roosevelt's personal character, believing that if this bill is passed, he will use the power he has to drag the United States into war. However, the reasons of the supporters have more sound arguments. They believe that in such an urgent international situation, what the United States needs most in its actions now is speed and breadth. In order to achieve this goal, the President should be given full power to act expediently. So far, the latter faction has completely won, but the summary result is that a two-year time limit has been added to this power; that is, these two years have given Roosevelt enough room to operate and deal with everything.

The fourth focus is the issue of limiting the scope of application. If the first three foci are assumed to be without problems, that is, after the government faction wins, then the so-called point of scope of application should be exactly as in the original case; in other words, the Lend-Lease Act is fully applicable to all democratic countries that resist aggression and fight for freedom, such as China, Britain, Greece, and so on. However, the opposition has raised objections in many ways. The largest category is that the application of this bill should be limited to Britain. The second category is to further advocate that the object of application of this bill should be particularly for the British mainland, Canada, and other autonomous territories, as well as the British colonies, in the form of "grants"; in other words, even Britain's allies should be excluded. The most famous of this faction are the so-called "Substitute Bill" proposed by the Democratic Party, the proposal of "Isolationist" leader Johnson, and the proposal of another leader, Taft. However, the evolution of the world situation and the reactions of the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan in recent days have fully proved the correctness of the opinions of the supporters and strengthened their strength. When Hull delivered a speech on the 16th of last month denouncing the world's aggressive forces, he began by talking about Japan's invasion of northeastern China in 1931. Therefore, in terms of the scope of application, Roosevelt's principle of aiding all democratic countries has actually been completely established.

The "Lend-Lease Act" will soon be put to the final debate and vote. Its passage has now become a foregone conclusion. According to general estimates, its favorable advantage will probably reach a ratio of two to one. In the near future, we can expect further solid and courageous actions from the United States to gradually implement its program to defeat the "New Order"!

### Germany Encourages Japan to Advance Southward, Restraining the United Anglo-American Front; Japan's Control of Vietnam as a Precursor to Invading Singapore; American Newspapers Praise the Netherlands East Indies' Unyielding Attitude

Washington - The terms of the ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Vietnam have not yet been announced. However, the notion that Japan has taken advantage of the opportunity to reap benefits, which has been circulating in the Far East, was anticipated by people here and is not surprising. Analysts of the current situation believe that Japan is using the guise of mediation to secure practical benefits without resorting to force. Well-informed sources here generally believe that Japan's new tactics are in collusion with the Axis powers. It is almost impossible to believe that the recent events in Vietnam are unrelated to the forces of Berlin because the situation in Vietnam and the Axis situation are essentially the same, which cannot but raise doubts. This view is quite evident, that Berlin intends to place Japan in a position where it can readily attack Singapore and Rangoon and, if development goes smoothly, can further invade the Dutch East Indies. Although Japan may not be able to carry out this kind of threat in the near future, it has taken a further step in its strong determination to advance southward, as mentioned recently by its Foreign Minister Matsuoka. Yesterday, "The Washington Star" commented on the political situation arising from Japan's continued violation of Vietnamese sovereignty, calling it a hurricane climate and stating that in this climate, the news that the Dutch East Indies has refused to join Japan's "New Order" is truly invigorating. "The New York Post" also commented on the Dutch East Indies' announcement of not participating in Japan's "New Order," saying that although Japan has achieved its ambitions in Vietnam, this announcement will certainly displease it. Those naval and military personnel, with a pirate mentality, encourage each other to advance southward, hoping to gain without effort, will now realize the reason why planned matters are underestimated and robbery is not easy. They may think that the Dutch East Indies would not dare to make this announcement without British encouragement or secret military and naval assistance from the United States. The Germans are likely to gladly believe this to be true, as the only purpose Germany hopes Japan will serve is to restrain the United States from focusing solely on Europe. However, the Japanese may not welcome this because what Japan wants to use Germany for is nothing more than to prevent the British navy from looking eastward when Japan seizes the opportunity to gain benefits. The Japanese would rather see American warships in the Atlantic sinking German submarines than see them appearing in the western Pacific, providing those whom Japan wants to invade with the ability to resist, which is now despised by the occupying forces who are viewed lightly by the Chinese. Whether the Dutch East Indies has obtained a guarantee of American assistance is still questionable. However, the Dutch East Indies' announcement of not participating in Japan's "New Order" is indeed a wise move. Vietnam can serve as a lesson: submission to Japan yields nothing, and the best way to gain American assistance is to rise up and prepare for war. (Reuters, 4th)

Washington - Knowledgeable people here said yesterday that, as a result of the policy of aiding Britain, the US government now expects that British and American defense equipment will be used by each other without distinction. On the same note, it was strongly argued that the current trend of US foreign policy is likely to develop in this direction. Some believe that in order to maintain world peace after the war, it is necessary to establish its foundation on Anglo-American political and economic cooperation. According to him, the above-mentioned trend is being promoted by these people. According to the opinions of administrative officials, they also expect that in the future, Britain and the United States will use each other's defense equipment, in addition to manpower, to resist aggression. They expect that Britain and the United States will not only exchange naval and military bases but also "lend-lease" all kinds of necessary defense items, including warships. Therefore, people generally expect that the two countries will use each other's needed defense materials, and in practice, they may not be involved in the war. The Lend-Lease Act authorizes the President to allow British warships to use US bases and can allow Britain to lease any defense equipment, including warships. US government officials hope to use defense materials with Britain without distinction in exchange for American assistance. Knowledgeable people here say that the United States is very willing to use the ports and airfields of southeastern Australia and northern New Zealand. The initial benefits sought by President Roosevelt now may be the above-mentioned points. It is indicated that if the United States can use bases in Australia and New Zealand, it can strengthen the United States' means against Japan. Military experts believe that this move can keep the Philippines out of Japan's range of attack and allow the United States to gain an advantage in the South China Sea. (International Society, 4th)

### The Dutch East Indies Included in the "Co-Prosperity Sphere"; The Dutch Government Lodges a Protest; The Japanese Side Indicates Its Determination to Reject It; Negotiations in Batavia Stalled

Batavia - Well-informed sources in the Dutch East Indies believed yesterday that Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi's rejection of Dutch Ambassador to Japan Pabst's views on the independence of the Dutch East Indies was inexplicable. The reason being that Pabst had a discussion with Ohashi the previous week regarding the inclusion of the Dutch East Indies in the scope of Japan's dream of the "East Asia New Order." He notified Ohashi that he had received instructions from the Dutch government in London to reject Japan's attempt to include the Dutch East Indies in Japan's "Co-Prosperity Sphere." It is heard that Ohashi also rejected the Dutch protest at the time, pointing out that Japan's plan to include the Dutch East Indies in the Co-Prosperity Sphere only concerns economic factors and not political factors. It is rumored from the Japanese side that the explanation regarding Japan's inclusion of the Dutch East Indies in the "Co-Prosperity Sphere" has been made clear by Ohashi, so the current Dutch-Japanese economic negotiations in Batavia will continue to be based on economics, and the attitude of the Dutch government in London can be ignored. As for the Dutch in Batavia commenting on Ohashi's rejection of Pabst's protest and the Japanese statement to Pabst later, they said that the relationship between the Dutch government and the Dutch East Indies is a "factual situation" and there is no need for the Japanese to reject acceptance or discuss it. The Japanese Vice Foreign Minister's statement that the Dutch government does not need to interfere with Japan's "Greater East Asia" plan is completely incomprehensible. The Japanese must know that negotiations are currently being conducted with representatives sent by the Dutch government. (United Press, 4th)

Tokyo - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii stated today while receiving foreign visitors that the Dutch envoy to Japan presented the Japanese government last Friday with a memorandum from the Dutch government in London, protesting Japan's inclusion of the Dutch East Indies into the East Asian New Order's Co-Prosperity Sphere. He said that Vice Minister Ohashi's attitude almost indicated that the Dutch government in London was not qualified to manage this matter, and that the Vice Minister did not pay much attention to this memorandum. When asked if the Vice Minister refused to recognize the Dutch government in London, Ishii replied, "I cannot say that he definitely does." When asked which government Japan recognizes as the Dutch government, Ishii replied that the Japanese government legally recognizes the Dutch government in London, but in reality, it should be discussed separately. For example, regarding negotiations on the affairs of the Dutch East Indies, Japan can only deal with the government of the Dutch East Indies. When asked if Japan refuses to recognize the Polish and Norwegian governments in London, Ishii replied that this is a delicate issue and must be discussed on a case-by-case basis. Ishii also hinted that the position of the Dutch envoy to Japan is very difficult, as he cannot represent the Dutch government in London, nor does he represent the government of the Dutch East Indies. When asked if the talks between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia have stalled, Ishii replied no, and that they are still in progress. It is expected that the government of the Dutch East Indies will submit a counter-proposal to the Japanese delegation in the middle of this week. (Reuters, 4th)

Tokyo - According to semi-official Japanese sources in Batavia, Dutch East Indies government spokesman Leitman warned that if the reasons for Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi's rejection of the Dutch note of January 31st are not clarified, the continuation of the Dutch East Indies and Japan conference in Batavia will be difficult. (Reuters, 4th)

Batavia - News today, the Dutch authorities have refused the Japanese request that the Dutch East Indies allow Japan to have a superior position in the Dutch East Indies in terms of commerce or development. The Dutch rejection was conveyed to the Japanese side by Van Mook, the chief Dutch representative in the Dutch-Japanese talks, when he submitted a counter-proposal to the Japanese side yesterday. The Dutch East Indies' reply not only refuses to allow Japan to obtain a superior position, but also refuses to consider it. However, it is also heard that Van Mook said that the Dutch East Indies is prepared to discuss the development of regular trade relations with Japan. Yoshizawa, the chief Japanese representative in the Dutch-Japanese talks, told a United Press reporter that the Japanese delegation has prepared a new proposal for later discussion. Yoshizawa also expressed hope that negotiations would begin immediately. It is also officially recognized here that Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi's recent statement to Dutch Minister to Japan Pabst is a serious obstacle to future negotiations. (United Press, 4th)

### Japan Considers Invoking Belligerent Rights to Prevent Third-Party Aid to China; Matsuoka Says He Has Not Abandoned Adjusting US-Japan Relations

Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently issued a statement saying that the Japanese government will consider all belligerent rights to deal with third countries in the Sino-Japanese War, and expressed hope that Japan has not abandoned improving US-Japan relations. During his statement, the Japanese Foreign Minister was asked whether Japan would go to war with the United States if the United States were at war with Germany and Italy, and whether Japan's allies would abandon Japan in danger and stand idly by if the Soviet Union attacked Japan. Matsuoka refused to answer both questions. Matsuoka's statement was made at an open meeting of the Lower House Budget Committee, at a time when the secret meeting of the Japanese House of Peers Budget Committee was attracting attention because of reports that former Foreign Minister Arita had questioned Matsuoka on some issues regarding Japan's foreign policy. Japanese evening newspapers all revealed indirect criticisms of the mystery surrounding the questioning and answering of this important issue. A man named Imai asked Matsuoka whether the resolution of the Sino-Japanese War would not proceed smoothly if ships carrying military supplies to Chongqing were sunk. Matsuoka then replied that the Japanese government has indeed implemented belligerent rights within the necessary scope, and the full implementation of belligerent rights is under consideration. Imai then asked whether Japan must act according to the Tripartite Pact if the United States joins the European war, and whether Germany and Italy would not be able to help Japan if the Soviet Union attacked Japan. The Foreign Minister refused to answer these two questions, but pointed out that the main purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to adjust Japanese-Soviet relations, and Germany and Italy will also be friendly with the Soviet Union. "I want to act according to the current trend, and as for the future, we can only let it be." Matsuoka agreed with the views of the earlier questioner Tsurumi, saying that we must inform the United States of the fact that the Japanese economy does not depend on the United Kingdom and the United States. "I now want to clearly explain that our southward advance policy is beneficial to both Japan and the United States. In addition, I want to tell the United States that our Tripartite Pact is not intended to attack the United States, and its purpose is to prevent war with the United States," and so on.

### Japan's Southward Advance, Signs Increasingly Apparent

Chongqing - According to semi-official Chinese sources, Japan's intensification of its southward advance is becoming increasingly apparent. Recently, in addition to increasing marines in the Spratly Islands, Japan has also added weather stations and radio stations. Radio stations have also been established on Bonaparten Island south of Hong Kong. The 28th Division, originally stationed on Hainan Island, will be transferred to the Hanoi area to threaten Burma. Military experts here believe that all of this proves that Japan is preparing for a southward advance. (Havas, 4th)

### Soviet-Japanese Negotiations on New Fisheries Agreement; Candidates for Both Delegations; Commercial Negotiations to Resume

Moscow - On January 21, 1941, the Soviet Union and Japan signed an agreement stipulating the establishment of a committee to draft a new fisheries agreement. Now, in accordance with that agreement, the Soviet government has appointed a negotiation delegation, the list of which is as follows: People's Committee Member Lovsky (Head of the Delegation), Director of the Second Far East Department of the People's Foreign Committee Chalapkin (Deputy Head of the Delegation), Director of the Legal Department of the Foreign Committee Pavlov, Director of the Eastern Department of the People's Committee for Foreign Trade Gumikin, Director of the Foreign Exchange Department of the People's Finance Committee Chairubin. In addition, Bavlichev was appointed as the secretary of the delegation. On the other hand, the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union has notified the Soviet Union that the Japanese delegation has also been appointed, and the list is as follows: Nishiharu Hiko (Head of the Delegation), Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union Yoshikawa (Deputy Head of the Delegation), First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union Saito, etc. (Tass, 4th)

Tokyo - A Japanese government spokesman announced this morning that Soviet-Japanese commercial negotiations will soon resume, and the shipment of Japanese goods to Germany may also be included. The commercial chop was suspended by the Soviet Union last year, at which time the opinions of both sides were not far apart (Reuters, 4th)

### US Defense Materials Sold to Japan; Congressman Questions Government

Washington - Oregon Republican Senator Holman protested on the floor yesterday that the United States is still selling important defense materials to Japan at a time when it deeply believes it is threatened by Japan. Holman said that a large amount of defense materials are still being shipped to Russia from the US West Coast, including tinplate worth $400,000 and thousands of aviation beacons, and demanded that the government provide an explanation. (United Press, 4th)

### US Government Restricts Oil and Cotton Exports; To Implement a License System

New York - According to the New York Herald, President Roosevelt may propose a licensing method to restrict the export of cotton and gasoline. The official explanation for this move will be that it is necessary to place the export of various raw materials needed by industry under national control. However, the real reason is said to be due to the informal complaint from British Ambassador Halifax that batches of gasoline shipped from the United States to the Soviet Union are ultimately reaching Germany. The newspaper also believes that the proposal of this licensing method is a response to Japan's increased influence in Vietnam. (Reuters, 4th)

### British Forces in North Africa Prepare for Attack on Benghazi; South African Troops Gain Important Stronghold in Algerian Territory; One-Fourth of Italian Colonies Lost

Cairo - British headquarters communique states that the British mechanized team in Eritrea (west coast of the Red Sea) is pressing on the Italian army. The Italian army is retreating towards the railway to Karen. Also, the Italian army in Abyssinia is retreating to the northwest towards Gondar. The British army is in close pursuit. The British detachment is still very active in Italian Somaliland, penetrating deep into Italian territory. In Libya, everything is now arranged to strike Benghazi directly from Derna (where the headquarters of the Italian army in Libya is located). (United Press, 4th)

Cairo - A British Air Force communique states that on Sunday, British bombers and fighters heavily attacked the highway between Derna and Benghazi in Libya. Italian troops and trucks in Slonta, 25 miles southwest of Apollonia, were also strafed by British aircraft, destroying 13 trucks. British aircraft also attacked motor transport vehicles on the highway between Maraua and Gaba. The Apollonia airfield was attacked, destroying three twin-engine monoplanes and one Caproni bomber. Italian troops and convoys in the area were also strafed. In Chigar, ten miles south of Apollonia, an Italian Fiat biplane was shot down. On February 1, the South African British Air Force bombed enemy artillery positions in East Africa. The British Air Force also assisted the army in the attack, dive-bombing the Barentu fort and buildings. A motor transport convoy concentrated in one place was also bombed, destroying at least 50 vehicles. Motor vehicles and highways concentrated west of Asmara were heavily bombed. Also, a Savoia Italian bomber was shot down in Agordat. All British aircraft returned safely except for one. (Reuters, 4th)

Nairobi - South African British troops have entered Abyssinian territory, seizing two Italian army outposts and gaining a foothold. An official report states that South African British troops have occupied two Italian army outposts within ten miles of the Abyssinian border at El Geermo and Gorai. Two Italian army officers and 43 soldiers were killed, and another three officers and 50 soldiers, along with machine guns, rifles, and ammunition, were captured. British casualties were very slight. After this victory, the British army occupied the Hobok outpost, seven miles north of the border, west of Gorai. British army patrols in other areas continued to be active. (Reuters, 4th)

New Delhi - A communique states that Indian mechanized cavalry, infantry, and engineers are now participating in the war in Italian East Africa. According to recent reports, Indian engineers and mine-laying troops are working in the valley near Koro, with excellent results. (Reuters, 4th)

London - British troops are now tracking Italian troops along the post road from Barentu to the southeast and attacking them fiercely. In the northern sector, British troops in trucks, led by light armored vehicles, continue to advance towards Kiren, 50 miles east of Agordat. The difficulties encountered by the British army are increasing because, due to the terrain, it is difficult to clearly define the front line in Eritrea. However, it is estimated that the land occupied by the British army is about 10,000 square miles, or about one-fourth of the Italian colony. It is heard that the British army in Abyssinia is advancing towards Gondar, 90 miles from the Sudanese border, and the situation is quite successful. The Italian army there continues to retreat eastward and is being pursued along the way by Abyssinian patriots and British troops. In the Somaliland sector, the British scout team is now deeply pressing into enemy territory. (Reuters, 4th)

### Greek Troops in Southern Albania Close to Vlora Port; Central Front Consolidates New Positions

Southern Greece, Syriuga - Border reports state that after weeks of hard fighting, Greek troops reached the coast of Vlora Bay yesterday, occupying Dukati Bay (at the southern end of Vlora Bay), 17 kilometers from Vlora City. Another column of Greek troops on that road also advanced in the Karaunia Mountains, occupying the Italian fortresses guarding the gates of Vlora. Other Greek troops are also in pursuit of Italian troops. (United Press, 4th)

Athens - War report: Just as heavy rains poured down on the Albanian front, indicating the end of winter, Greek troops were consolidating their lines in central Albania yesterday, preparing to inflict a fatal blow on the Italian army in the area and destroy it completely. Military observers believe that the occupation of Mount Tremsehna will make it easier for General Papagos's army to make a final offensive towards Tepelena and other bases in the area. According to captured Italian officers, Italian Chief of Staff General Cavallero, Foreign Minister Ciano, and Fascist Party Secretary General Farinacci have all arrived at the central front, planning to reorganize the Italian army in the area. Italian prisoners claimed that General Cavallero ordered that those who retreated would be shot immediately, and soldiers who made defeatist remarks would also be subject to the same punishment. The Italian army is now transferring reinforcements from various fronts to central Albania with the most rapid action. (International Society, 4th)

### Germany Seeks to Facilitate Greek-Italian Reconciliation

Sofia - According to reliable sources yesterday, when British Middle East Commander-in-Chief General Wavell recently went to Athens, the Greeks requested more British military aid. It is believed that General Wavell told the Greek authorities that Britain could provide large-scale assistance to Greek troops as soon as the Italian army's stronghold of Benghazi in northern Libya fell into British hands. However, it is believed that the general also said that Britain could not assist Greece temporarily. Reliable sources believe that before Britain can effectively assist Greece and open a new front in the southeast to resist the German army, it will try to make Italy and Greece reconcile.

### Roosevelt's Special Envoy Leaves Turkey for Egypt; American Activities in the Balkans Make Berlin Uneasy

Turkey - Colonel Donovan, the personal representative of President Roosevelt, left here last night for Cairo. Turkish government representatives and US embassy officials went to the station to see him off. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

Istanbul - Roosevelt's representative Donovan is now touring the Balkan countries, and German diplomats are very uneasy, saying that Donovan is encouraging countries to take a unified stand against the pressure of the Axis powers and deal with it boldly. The Germans are troubled by the US interference in matters that are unrelated to the US. What is incomprehensible is that if Germany has no new plans in the Balkans, then why should it be so worried? Turks have differing opinions on this point. Reading Hitler's recent speech, some Turks believe that if Britain does not open a new front against the Axis powers via Thessaloniki, then Germany will not take any action in the Balkans. Others say that Hitler has decided that British troops will land in Thessaloniki, so he will use this as an excuse to occupy Bulgaria. The Germans are now spreading rumors that British troops have already landed at that port. It is heard that Donovan told the Turks that if Turkey participates in the war against Germany and is willing to receive material assistance from the United States, it will certainly receive it. (Reuters, 4th)

### Soviet-Turkish Agreement Theory, Soviet Union Denies

Moscow - Foreign newspapers (especially British newspapers) claim, "The Soviet Union and Turkey have established a secret agreement. The Soviet Union will supply Turkey with military fire to cope with German actions in the Balkans. Regarding this matter, Turkey has organized a delegation to go to Moscow to purchase military fire." Tass recently issued a statement authorized by the official, "The Soviet Union and Turkey have not established any agreement or secret agreement, and there is no intention to conclude an agreement. There is no delegation from Turkey to purchase military fire in Moscow at present. The rumors spread by foreign newspapers are purely fabricated." (Tass, 4th)

### Southern Hungary Flooded; Tens of Thousands of Acres of Farmland Inundated

Hungarian Capital - The flood near the Hungarian capital has become a disaster. Due to the flooding of the Danube River, 10,000 acres of land have been submerged, and the dikes have collapsed and been washed away. The water level is as high as 15 meters higher than before. Several towns and villages are like islands in the middle of the water. There are also frozen ice floes. Natgrel, the pig-producing center, now has 40,000 pigs in danger. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

### Turkey and Bulgaria Intensify Military Preparations; Two Countries Engage in Diplomatic Negotiations to Cooperatively Maintain Balkan Peace

Budapest: Reports indicate that Turkey and Bulgaria are intensifying military preparations. Key locations on Turkey's Thracian border have long been heavily defended. Sources say that Turkey has dispatched additional troops to reinforce the Thracian border defenses. Simultaneously, Bulgaria is reportedly mobilizing two classes of reservists. (International News Service, 4th)

Sofia: Bulgarian Minister to Turkey, Kiroff, is currently engaged in negotiations with the Turkish government, aiming for mutual cooperation between the two countries to maintain Balkan peace. Regarding this matter, the Turkish government, based on British advice, proposed an agreement with Bulgaria last December, solemnly stipulating that neither country would allow the armies of third countries to pass through their territories. However, this was rejected by the Bulgarian authorities. The matter has now been brought up again. Bulgaria insists that the agreement to be concluded between the two countries should indirectly state that even if Bulgaria is occupied by another country, Turkey will not consider it an unfriendly act and therefore need not intervene. However, whether this agreement will materialize remains uncertain. (Havas, 3rd)

Willkie Granted Audience with the King; Trip to Southern Ireland

London: Wendell Willkie, the former Republican presidential candidate of the United States, is currently on an extensive tour of Britain under wartime conditions. It is expected that Willkie will have an audience with the King and Queen today. Yesterday, Willkie visited Liverpool to inspect the aftermath of the bombings. After touring the bombed areas, he arrived at the City Hall and stated that what he had seen proved that this kind of war, though extremely brutal, had not achieved the desired effect of slaughtering civilians or shaking morale, but had instead strengthened the determination of the people. Willkie also emphasized the importance of effective industrial production during wartime. Willkie then toured the dock area, where workers praised him as a great man. Willkie also spent an hour touring the bombed and damaged areas of Manchester, where he was warmly welcomed by the public, with a level of enthusiasm unseen in the area for many years. Vehicle traffic was repeatedly blocked by the crowds, and the authorities had to deploy additional police to prevent Willkie from being surrounded and unable to leave. Willkie told reporters, "The questions I came here to ask have been answered." Willkie mentioned his conversations with hundreds of civilians, saying, "The people's spirit is strong and resilient. He does not believe that the unity of the people in any country in the world is greater than that of the people of the British Isles. He was more impressed by the continuing industrial production than by the devastation he saw. (Reuters, 4th)

London: Wendell Willkie, the former Republican presidential candidate of the United States, finally had the opportunity to travel to Southern Ireland. Willkie suddenly made preparations last night and flew to Dublin this morning. However, his stay in Southern Ireland will be limited to a meeting with de Valera, hoping to return here in time to implement his plan to return home early and testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Lend-Lease Act.

London: According to reports received here, Australian Prime Minister Menzies has arrived in Jerusalem and is being hosted by British military authorities. (Reuters, 4th)

### US Naval Circles Estimate: French Fleet Still Retains Three-Quarters of its Strength

Washington: According to information disclosed by the US Naval High Command to members of Congress yesterday, three-quarters of the French fleet remains intact and is the strongest weapon that French Premier Marshal Pétain uses to reject German demands. Admiral Stark made this accurate statement for the first time in a closed session of the House Naval Affairs Committee. Stark stated that the Germans wanted to use the French fleet for an invasion of Britain. If the invasion failed, they could still use it in the Mediterranean. Captain Knox testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stating that he knew that German leader Hitler was currently "negotiating" to acquire the French fleet. We should recall that after the fall of France, the British fleet clashed with the French fleet in the Battle of Mers-el-Kébir, where several French ships were sunk by the British, including at least two French cruisers. At the time, it was claimed that most of the French fleet had either been captured or sunk by the British, but subsequent evidence proved that this information was exaggerated. According to Admiral Stark's statement to the House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday, it was the first official report revealing that three-quarters of the French fleet remains completely intact.

### Cabinet Changes Expected in Paris Discussions; Laval Rumored to Join Cabinet and Assume Power; Laval and Pétain Cooperate to Resolve Current Crisis

Vichy: Following a meeting between French Naval Chief Admiral Darlan, former Deputy Prime Minister Laval, and German Ambassador Abetz in Paris, the 50-day deadlock in Franco-German relations appears to be coming to an end. Observers predict that the current Vichy cabinet will fall within a week, and Laval, a favorite of Germany, will join the new cabinet and assume power, guaranteeing cooperation with Germany. United Press International has learned that considerable progress has been made in resolving the crisis. France appears to be leaning towards a government led by Laval, Baudouin, Admiral Darlan, and General Huntziger, with Laval wielding great power. Observers believe that Marshal Pétain will retain full authority as the head of government, Admiral Darlan will be responsible for internal affairs, Laval will be Minister of Foreign Affairs and Propaganda, General Huntziger will be Minister of Defense, and Baudouin will be responsible for all technical departments, including finance, labor, production, agriculture, and transportation. Recently, Admiral Darlan stated in the Official Gazette yesterday that the French fleet, both now and in the future, will "under French authority, unite and defend the homeland and empire against attacks and provocations from any direction." (United Press International, 4th)

Vichy: Following the official announcement that Vichy government Naval Chief Admiral Darlan had departed for Paris, conflicting rumors about Darlan's intentions and whereabouts spread throughout the day. On Monday morning, Swiss radio reported that Darlan had indeed gone to Paris. Subsequently, a report from Budapest confirmed this, stating that German authorities had notified Darlan that further talks between France and Germany would be futile unless Vichy understood the situation created by the National Unity Party's organization. The National Unity Party was established by the Nazis in the French occupied zone and is in conflict with Marshal Pétain, the head of the Vichy government. Later reports indicated that Darlan hoped to find harmony and a solution for France between the Vichy government and the new party. Whether Darlan's efforts in Paris are successful may have a significant impact on the near future of Europe. (Reuters, 4th)

New York: According to sources in Paris, Vichy Naval Chief Admiral Darlan's talks with German leaders in Paris appear to be aimed at seeking a compromise between the Paris Committee and Vichy. (Reuters, 4th)

Paris: French Naval Minister Admiral Darlan had a long conversation with former Foreign Minister Laval at the Hôtel Matignon yesterday. Participants included French Envoy Brinon. The discussion focused on general French policy issues. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

### Voroshilov's 60th Birthday Celebration

Moscow: On the occasion of Marshal Voroshilov's 60th birthday, the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Council of People's Commissars sent a congratulatory letter, stating, "Comrade Voroshilov, as a loyal comrade of Lenin and Stalin, you have made great contributions to the establishment of the Communist Party and the organization of the Red Army. On the occasion of your 60th birthday, we send our congratulations. In your youth, you dedicated yourself to the revolution. During the First Revolution from 1905 to 1907, you led the workers of the Donets Basin in battle, and together with Lenin and Stalin, you established the Bolshevik Party. You were an enthusiastic participant in the October Revolution and a key figure in the organization of the Red Army. In 1918, under your leadership, the Ukrainian Fifth Army defeated the White Cossacks and reached Stalingrad. The organization of the Red Army cavalry was also initiated by you. With the assistance of the cavalry, the Red Army embarked on a path of glorious victory and defeated Denikin's counter-revolutionary forces. The strength of the Red Army today is due to your guidance. The Party deeply knows that you are one of the bravest in fighting against the enemies of the Soviet Union. Your tireless spirit of struggle has won the love of all Soviet people. We wish you longevity so that you can continue to achieve further success for the Soviet Union and the Communist Party."

### London Times Reviews Japan's Policy; Warmongering Acts Border on Suicide; Ambitions for Hegemony Are Just Dreams

London: The London Times published an editorial entitled "The Turbulence of Japan's Policy," summarizing the trends in Japan's foreign policy in recent years. The article is as follows:

Starting with the September 18th Incident

When Japan embarked on the long and still irreversible path in Manchuria on the night of September 18, 1931, its leaders possessed a cleverness in moving its people and the world with effect first, cause later. They first created the shadow of an event and then created the reality of the event, thereby fulfilling their wish to prove the legitimacy of their actions. When the Manchurian Incident occurred, the world was caught off guard and did not yet know this new trick. However, since then, this trick has become well-known, and even Hitler has not hesitated to imitate Japan, using the threat of weak countries as an excuse to annex them under the pretext of self-defense. The habit of creating intimidating slogans also originated from the Manchurian Incident. In 1931, we frequently heard about the 30 million oppressed people of Manchuria. Japanese speakers often uttered such figures. Before long, the world was repeatedly hearing about the hundreds of millions of oppressed people of China. Today, the world is gradually hearing about the several million oppressed people of Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, and other countries groaning under the bondage of white people. This is not without significance.

Matsuoka's Remarks Conceal Ambition

The recent remarks by the Japanese Foreign Minister in the Diet were also full of slogans. Matsuoka denounced the news of the failure of the Italian army as malicious propaganda. In fact, the Italian army's defeat has already been admitted by Italy itself. Matsuoka expressed friendship towards the Axis, moderation towards the Soviet Union, friendliness towards South America, and threats towards Vietnam, Thailand, and the Dutch East Indies. However, the real meaning of his remarks is clearly to create the shadow of Japan being surrounded by Britain and the United States. His remarks are almost identical to those made by Germany. In fact, the British Empire is engaged in an unprecedented struggle with a strong enemy, and the United States is preparing to support the British Empire. It is impossible to spare the time and energy to surround Japan. This is almost unbelievable, but those who believe in Germany will believe it. Is the shadow of encirclement a shadow that comes before the event? Will this event eventually become inevitable for Japan to act? This certainly coincides with the trick mentioned in the first paragraph of this article. However, is Japan actually going to take such a dangerous and suicidal course of action? It seems incredible.

Rivalry between China and Japan Is Difficult to Eradicate

The European War from 1914 to 1918 gave Japan an unprecedented opportunity to expand its trade. Japan was one of the signatories to the peace treaty (a point that Germany and Japan have deliberately ignored), reaping the benefits of the Allied victory. The Marshall and Caroline Islands, originally belonging to Germany, were placed under Japanese administration. However, Japan has long been unwilling to publicly disclose the details of the administration and development of these islands. During the last war, the Allies sacrificed countless lives and treasure. Compared to what Japan sacrificed at the time, the difference is like heaven and earth. Japan enjoyed years of prosperity and peace as a result of the Allies' bloodshed and financial losses. However, the speculative trend of Japanese finance eventually led to the Great Depression of 1929 hitting Japan harder than other countries. However, at that time, the trend of blaming others for one's own problems was not yet prevalent. Before the autumn of 1931, Japan still pursued a steady and prudent policy, seeking to restore its trade and financial position in the usual way. Not only that, but Japan also pursued a legitimate policy of seeking China's friendship. This was the only way for Japan to secure a large share of the Chinese market. Japan, due to its geographical proximity and low manufacturing costs, could occupy a large share of the Chinese market. However, the long record of rivalry between China and Japan, especially starting with the 1895 war and the Twenty-One Demands of 1915, was difficult to eradicate. Japan's former patience, which had earned it the respect of other countries, was eventually overshadowed by the rapidly growing ambition and pragmatism within the country. Thus, some members of the army attempted to take a shortcut to prosperity in September 1931. From then on, Japan embarked on a path of aggression contrary to peace, using force instead of negotiation to resolve disputes. After Manchuria had fallen, a puppet regime was established. In early 1935, mainland China, or at least North China, had clearly become the second stepping stone for Japan's expansion.

War of Aggression against China Falls into Quagmire

The hostilities that began in 1937 have lasted for four years and are still not over. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people have suffered. Chinese ports and many large cities have been occupied. However, four years of war have not allowed Japan to achieve its goals, nor have they changed the Chinese people's determination to be masters of their own destiny. The Japanese people initially thought that the war against China would be short and glorious. They did not expect it to be so prolonged. In order to explain the prolongation of the war, the Japanese authorities had to blame others. Although they blamed more than one country, they often pointed to Britain as the main culprit in this drama. Britain has more rights in China than any other country. Japan's attacks on Britain are certainly appropriate, because to exclude the influence of Western countries in China, the first goal must be to exclude Britain. The sympathy of the British people is inclined towards China, and Britain, like other countries, has given some material assistance to China. However, this sympathy and this limited assistance are not the reasons for the courage of China to resist. It can be said that what has contributed to the courage of China to resist is Japan itself. Japan, with its actions to dominate China, has made China strive to become a large group with the determination to resist, and has aroused the fighting spirit that was previously unseen among this peace-loving nation. What Japan has already brought about is what it wants to eliminate. It is hardly surprising that it is now blaming others.

Willing to Be a Tool of the Axis Powers

The war in China has become sticky, and the European war has given Japan a possible opportunity. Japan initially had no activities and was willing to be passive, but in late June 1940, when Germany had captured Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, Japan saw clear evidence of the benefits of aggression, reorganized the government, and appointed Matsuoka as its spokesman. Soon after, it signed the Tripartite Pact, openly joining the ranks of those hostile to Britain and threatening the United States to deter it from interfering in the European war. Unfortunately, after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, Hitler's promise to the world, especially to Japan, that Britain would soon be overthrown did not seem to be realized. Since Britain was not overthrown and the United States had an unexpectedly strong reaction to the Tripartite Pact, Japan did hesitate somewhat, and the world sometimes heard that this alliance was merely a formality and sometimes that this alliance would definitely be implemented. Germany remained active, whispering to Japan that everything was going well, that the United States was not prepared for war, and that a little show of strength would be enough to scare it away. Britain has not been overthrown for the time being, but this is only to make this overthrow more effective. What Germany told Japan was nothing more than that if Japan had the courage to let go and do what it wanted, then what it wanted would be in its grasp. What Germany wanted was for Japan to join the war to help Germany. Even if Japan did not win, it would not matter to Germany. At most, the three powers would turn from strong to weak. As for Japan being able to share the new world order with Germany on an equal footing, this was certainly not in Hitler's plans. Japan's position is only as a tool, not as a colleague.

Reckless Adventure Puts National Destiny in Danger

From Matsuoka's remarks, Germany could see that its instigation was indeed effective. Matsuoka's remarks not only threatened the security of Thailand, Vietnam, and the Dutch East Indies, but also the security of Britain and the United States. If Japan actually carries out its threats, it will see a firm defense and see the new weapons it uses, just as Matsuoka said. However, what Japan does not yet know is that Matsuoka's real threat is not detrimental to the security of the aforementioned countries, but detrimental to the peace, prosperity, and happiness of the Japanese people. Japan has been engaged in conquest for ten years and has never brought spiritual or material benefits to its people. Now, after four years of war in China, there have been many deaths and great losses, but no effect. The Japanese authorities are now urging their people to believe that aggression is the best speculation. Although previous efforts have not yielded benefits, if more capital and sacrifices are added, the future gains will be many, not just dividends. This behavior that disregards human value will be assimilated with Hitler's. Japanese leaders seem to have believed Hitler's words and been hypnotized by him. Their chaotic finances and bad politics may push their people into an irreparable catastrophe, but this is not what they care about. Germany has already said it, and what Germany says must be true.

Wake Up Early to Avoid Being Reduced to Ruins

Recalling the great men who led to Japan's greatness decades ago, such as Ito, Okuma, and Saionji, although they had dreams of empire, they were not driven by vanity, nor did they blindly seek imperfect friends. Although they transformed a feudal country into a modern country in fifty years, they did not trap their country in reckless adventures, nor did they make calls to be surrounded. What they sent was the voice of Japan, so they could place Japan on a secure foundation. However, the temporarily dormant volcano still exists and has been erupting for the past decade. The flames are spraying out and not stopping, and the molten rock is flowing out, destroying everything. Will it sooner or later reach the point of no return? When it becomes calm again in the future, although the ground has cooled, what is buried beneath will eventually become eternal ruins. (Reuters, 4th)

### US House of Representatives Engages in Heated Debate on Lend-Lease Act; Government Spokesman Issues Warning; If Britain Is Defeated, the US Will Be Attacked from Both Sides

Washington: Yesterday was the first of three days of debate on the Aid to Britain Bill. Government spokesmen warned the House that if Britain were defeated, Germany and Japan would simultaneously "attack" the United States. This prediction was made by Congressman Johnson of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Johnson is a high-ranking Democrat and a confidant of President Roosevelt. The situation during the debate was already tense, and Johnson's warning brought the tension to its highest point. The House unanimously agreed to end the general debate tomorrow night. Amendments will be discussed on Thursday, and the final vote is expected on Friday. House Speaker Rayburn predicted that it would get a majority of one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five votes. (International News Service, 4th)

Washington: The debate in the House of Representatives on the Lend-Lease Act has entered an intense stage. Congressman Jackson, a Republican from Illinois, demanded that the authorities explain the motives behind British Ambassador Halifax's recent visit to the House of Representatives. Jackson believed that the new British ambassador's move was "extraordinary" and stated that if the ambassador had anything to say, Congress should have the right to know. Chairman Bloom of the Foreign Affairs Committee stated, "Regarding Halifax's visit, there is only one 'extraordinary' move, and that is that it has actually aroused questions from the Congressman from Illinois. Congressman Cofilton, a Democrat from Washington, urged that the United States should "abide by the Monroe Doctrine" and should not provide various forms of assistance to Britain. He also demanded that the United States should strengthen the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Congressman Fish, a Republican from New York, is a major opponent of the Lend-Lease Act. He pointed out that this move was a prelude to launching a wartime law. Corfe "and others strongly argued that" once the bill is implemented, the United States will inevitably be in danger of being dragged into the European and Asian wars. Congressman Chalmers, a Democrat from Illinois and a government spokesman, stated that the United States should do its best to help Britain in order to strengthen its national defense and protect the Western Hemisphere. Yesterday was the first day of the House debate on the Lend-Lease Act. The debate was very intense. The government insisted that it was necessary for national defense, while opponents believed that the bill would lead the United States to dictatorship and war. Representative Rabon and other leaders from Texas are confident that the government has sufficient strength to defeat the Republican amendment, which aims to reduce the president's power. Bloom stated during the debate, "The passage of this bill is the best guarantee of our country's territory and freedom. Even if we do not provide assistance to Britain, the danger of war is greater than aiding Britain." Congressman Johnson, a Democrat from Texas, stated during the debate that Germany and Italy were "pressuring" Japan to take "offensive actions" against the United States, and said that if Britain collapsed, Japan would definitely launch an attack on the United States. "We will be attacked from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans at the same time." (United Press International, 4th)

Washington: Senator La Follette stated before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that the Lend-Lease Act would give the power to decide whether the United States goes to war to one person. In March 1939, former French Prime Minister Daladier told him that France hoped that the United States would assist with financial resources, material resources, and manpower. Now this bill has stipulated financial resources and material resources. He dares to say that the US president will have reason to believe that this bill gives him the power to implement all the meanings of participation in the war. La Follette served as the governor of Wisconsin and organized the American Progressive Party in 1936. On the same day, Socialist Party leader Thomas also stated before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that after the bill is passed, US troops will definitely be sent to Europe, and the United States is in more danger of being drawn into the war. The United States wants to eliminate the power of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and it will inevitably use troops in Europe, Asia, or Africa. (Reuters, 4th)

Washington: A number of Republican leaders have drafted an alternative bill to the president's Aid to Britain Act, stipulating that Britain will be given credit to purchase goods worth US$1 trillion, and Britain will cede all of its territories in the Western Hemisphere except Canada to the United States. The initiator of this bill is Congressman Maas, a Republican from Minnesota, who can gain the support of the vast majority of Republicans and a part of the Democrats. Maas told United Press International reporters that this bill would allow Britain to obtain all the assistance it needs, but if Britain were defeated, the United States could guarantee that its national defense would not be threatened by enemies coming from neighboring islands.

### Germany Establishes New Consulate in Manchouli

Changchun: Germany has established a new consulate in Manchouli, presided over by Beckman, the former deputy consul in Yokohama. At the same time, the "Manchukuo government" also approved Germany to establish a consulate in Gegu Zi (transliteration). (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

### Grain 洋 Rice Hoarders Continue Their Mischief, But Fortunately Over 120,000 Bags of Rice Arrived Yesterday Alone, Discouraging Hoarders and Instantly Weakening Market Prices

Yesterday, a large amount of foreign rice arrived at the port. The Taigu Company's Taiyuan ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 3rd) in the late afternoon, carrying 5,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which were unloaded yesterday. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship was supposed to arrive the day before yesterday (the 3rd), but was delayed until yesterday morning. It arrived with 18,481 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition, Jardine Matheson's Yusheng, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, arrived earlier yesterday evening, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf. It also carried foreign rice, but the exact amount was not known due to the late arrival of the ship. We will investigate and report further today. The French ship Gouyerneur General A. Varenne (named Huali), managed by the Norwegian Chinese merchant Hua Lun Yanghang, directly carried 3,100 tons of foreign rice from Saigon to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of last month, but it had not arrived by the end of the month, and only entered the port yesterday morning, carrying over 32,000 bags of foreign rice. It docked at the Qichang warehouse in Pudong for unloading. In addition, the Yongzhen (St. Vincent de Paul, French nationality) ship, managed by the French merchant Xia Laochen Yanghang, also carried over 17,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon and arrived yesterday morning, docking at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. In addition, the Deda ship, also managed by Hua, directly transported 54,889 bags of foreign rice from Saigon and arrived yesterday morning, docking at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Yesterday, a total of 127,374 bags arrived. (Zu)

Yesterday, foreign rice arrived continuously, but the market reacted with positive sentiment and active hoarding. Both spot and futures prices continued to rise. Fortunately, actual spot sales have decreased, and the evaluated new offers have been lowered, so the market rose by about one yuan. However, the best and medium-quality goods have also reached their limit, and exceptionally high qualities are sometimes reluctantly withheld from sale. In the mid-market, because the prices have risen sufficiently, the willingness to absorb goods from both local stores and other merchants has noticeably weakened, and the upward trend has been curbed. Furthermore, due to the congestion of goods in the market, even a slight decline in sales will make it difficult for the market to sustain itself, and changes will occur immediately, gradually softening. Therefore, closing prices are more mixed. For example, No. 1 Saigon opened at 85 yuan and later settled at 83-84 yuan, No. 2 at 80 yuan to 77.8 yuan, No. 1 Siam from 85 yuan to 82-83 yuan, No. 2 at 78.5 yuan. In particular, fire-milled rice was the most abundant in the market, and with poor sales, it could only conservatively maintain the original price of 81-82 yuan. Only small-grain rice continued to be actively traded, increasing by about half a yuan. High-quality broken tips were also in demand due to their scarcity, rising by nearly one yuan, opening at 67 yuan or 66.5 yuan, and closing at 62-63 yuan. Re-bagging was most active at Yinghua, with a total turnover of no less than 1,400 tons throughout the day. February No. 1 Saigon was 94 yuan, No. 2 Saigon 91 yuan, small-grain spot 89 yuan to 88.5 yuan, January 16 at 88.5 yuan, January 15 delivery at 87 yuan, February Jianyuan rose from 86.5 yuan to 87.9 yuan, and Dafu February rose from 86.5 yuan to 87.6 yuan, one to two yuan higher than the previous market. In the new transactions, Nanqiao Company sold 500 tons of February No. 1 Saigon at a price of 93.7 yuan.

Various national rices such as thick and thin japonica rice arrive sporadically and continuously, but shops are reluctant to absorb them because national rice has become a luxury item, and most merchants mainly use foreign rice. With limited sales, although foreign rice continues to have a good appearance, it is difficult to compete with it, and the selling price can only hold the original price, similar to before. Regular special white japonica is still 107-108 yuan, and by measure is 102-103 yuan. Kunshan original white japonica is 104-105 yuan, and by measure is 100-97 yuan. Qingjiao by measure of thin rice is 95-96 yuan, and the original bag is 98-99 yuan.

Although there is not much glutinous rice on the market, sales declined yesterday, resulting in a lackluster market with no gains or losses. Hong Kong special white glutinous rice still opens at 78-79 yuan, and the middle closing is 76-77 yuan.

### Foreign Flour Sales Remain Active

Flour: Yesterday, the flour market continued to prosper. It was found that the Chinese factory's discounted flour was still 23 yuan, with 6,000 bags plus a few more supplied by the Fu and Fu factories, limited to retail sales on Mu Street. Therefore, in terms of customer sales, we can only rely on foreign flour. In addition, there were rumors of delays in the shipment of foreign flour to Shanghai, and everyone was hoping for a good market. The overall market opened with five thousand plus bags of Clock Tower and Bird & Flower brand Australian flour at a price of 24.9 yuan, and the bank's stock was 25 yuan, with an additional 0.1 yuan. Blue Mark Flower brand was 24.65 yuan, and Wild Boar and Beauty brands were two to three jiao higher than Clock Tower and Bird & Flower brands. At present, the supply from Hong Kong is constant, and the price of rice is reduced by one yuan, so the market is difficult to consolidate.

Wheat: The producing areas are exhausted and Shanghai's reserves are meager. All factories are waiting for foreign wheat to be supplied. They have little interest in domestic wheat, and only the Japanese factories have slightly increased their purchases, with the price still around 23 yuan. Market prices are frequently high, but there is no formal trading.

### Miscellaneous Grains Bean Cake Used as a Football - The Market Situation Becomes Chaotic

Recently, the oil cake market, because there is no opportunity to take advantage of the oil market, and there is no way to manipulate it, the general speculators who grab hats have changed their course and unanimously poured into bean cakes. The flat, round bean cake is used as a football to play with, kicking back and forth, causing the market to be chaotic. The price rises and falls unpredictably in one day, and the result is still to raise the corner code spectrum. The current cake of Ji Xing is 10,000 pieces, and the price is 15 yuan. More than 30,000 pieces are ordered for delivery in the upper part of March, and the price is from 15.25 yuan to 4 jiao, and then 15.35 yuan. The current cake of Fei Zi is 10 carts, and the price is from 15.3 jiao to 4 jiao. The current cake of Li Zi is 1,000 pieces, and the price is 15 yuan. 3,000 pieces are ordered for delivery in the lower part of February, and the price is 5 yuan and 1 jiao above. More than 10 carts of Yuanlong cake are delivered in the upper part of March, and the price is from 15.55 jiao to 4 jiao. More than 8,000 pieces of Yuanji cake are delivered in the lower part of February, and the price is 15 yuan, and from 15.05 yuan to 15.15 yuan in the upper part of March. 1,360 bags of soybeans were exported on the 5th and transported to Xiamen, and 955 bags were transported to Hong Kong. 2,000 pieces of bean cake were transported to Xiamen, and 7,240 pieces were transported to Hong Kong. 2,510 cans of raw oil were transported to Xiamen.

### Sugar Market: Diaoging Rises by Three Yuan, Granulated Sugar Arrives with Over 9,000 Bags

Yesterday's sugar market saw a softening trend due to sluggish actual sales and some floating merchants selling off. The association's prices were: spot No. 24 coarse white sugar at the warehouse was 82 yuan and 0.5 jiao, and at outside warehouses 81 yuan to 81.2 yuan and 0.4 jiao. For the 10th of February, the price was 81.4 jiao to 6 jiao and 0.2 jiao. For the 20th of February, the price was 81.8 jiao and 0.2 jiao. For the end of this month, the price was 81.8 jiao to 82 yuan and 0.1 jiao. Dutch cotton white secondary color was 78 yuan, BS mark was 79.5 yuan, and Dutch red was 65.5 yuan and a small sum. Taigu Che Yue B mark was 81.5 jiao to 6 jiao and 0.2 jiao, DY mark was 78.6 jiao, and HX mark was 78.4 jiao, with the same degree of reduction. The price of new Diaoging domestic sugar rose by 3 yuan to 67 yuan, as the production price was difficult to determine and there was a lack of arrivals, but there was inventory of old goods. The price of Dongxiang red sugar was still 58 yuan.

A large amount of granulated sugar arrived in Shanghai. The Taigu Taiyuan ship arrived the day before yesterday, carrying 9,450 bags of granulated sugar from Hong Kong.

### Dried and Preserved Goods Golden Vegetables Continue to Rise

Golden needle vegetables continue to rise as arrivals are insufficient, and there is stronger interest among brokers. The price of goods opened the day before yesterday at 126 yuan, and was 140 yuan yesterday, a rise of more than ten yuan. The Xiangzi brand vegetables also rose to 150 yuan.

### Silk and Tea Native Silk Decorates the Silk Market

Yesterday's overseas silk market saw no activity in New York, while Yokohama was uniformly bullish. The spot price opened at 1,385 yuan, continuing the rise of 15 yuan from the day before. February futures were 1,394 yuan, also up 14 yuan. July futures were 1,400 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan.

The local silk market remains sluggish. Yesterday, only white native silk was traded.

### Finance Chinese Merchants Continuously Sending Out Foreign Exchange, Foreign Banks' Intake Finally Sees Tightening

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's quoted prices. The black market for British and American exchanges was unstable. This was because the rumors had dissipated and speculators were reselling, resulting in more ample positions. However, foreign banks' appetite remained strong. In particular, a certain American bank was purchasing in the afternoon, accepting the American exchange sold by speculators without refusal. The majority of transactions throughout the day were for American exchange at between 5.3125 yuan and 5.28125 yuan. It firmed up at midday, with a rate of 5.34375 yuan. At the close, American exchange was flat and British exchange was tight at 0.015625, with American exchange at 5.3125 yuan and British exchange at 3 shillings 32.8125 pence.

Morning Market Trend Relaxed

At the beginning of the morning, London's big bars rose by 0.0625 for both near-term and long-term contracts. The price of silver in New York remained bullish, and the price of gold in London was stable. The exchange rate against the US dollar was unchanged, but it was 0.0125 yuan higher against Shanghai. The US dollar to British pound rate did not change, but the rate against Shanghai was 0.07 yuan lower. There was no market for the French franc. The central bank's quoted rates for all exchanges remained the same. Banks' morning opening prices for spot goods were 3 shillings 34.375 pence for British gold and 5.34375 yuan for American exchange, which was higher than the previous day's closing price. British exchange was flat and American exchange was firm by 0.03125 yuan. After the opening, the market calmed down. Speculators first intended to buy, settling American exchange for this month with a certain American bank at 5.3125 yuan. At 9:30, HSBC's listed prices were announced and remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax increased by 0.25%. At this time, Chinese merchant banks sought to sell, and Chinese merchant speculators also followed suit, selling American exchange for this month to foreign banks at 5.3125 yuan. However, the price for American exchange for the next month was 5.28125 yuan. Subsequently, because Chinese merchant speculators continued to sell American exchange quite eagerly, the underlying trend relaxed. The brokerage firms and brokers purchased American exchange for this month at 5.34375 yuan. The noon closing was also stable, with spot British gold at 3 shillings 34.375 pence and American exchange at 5.34375 yuan, similar to the morning opening price.

American Bank's Strong Interest

In the afternoon, speculators first came to sell American exchange for this month. Initially, a certain American bank absorbed it at a price of 5.3125 yuan, but the bank's appetite was unusually strong, leading to a softening of the underlying trend. The evening closing prices for spot and this month's British gold were 3 shillings 32.8125 pence, and American exchange was 5.3125 yuan. The next month's prices were 3 shillings 29.6875 pence for British gold and 5.28125 yuan for American exchange, which was 0.015625 yuan lower for spot British exchange and flat for American exchange compared to yesterday's closing price.

### Speculation Concentrated on Cotton Yarn, Gold Market Begins to Feel Calm

Yesterday's raw gold black market experienced slight fluctuations, with prices still fluctuating around the 6,700 yuan mark. This was because the foreign exchange market stabilized, and speculators concentrated their efforts on manipulating the spot yarn market, leading to a sudden weakening of the gold market. The atmosphere was quite stable on all sides, because the foreign exchange market quickly returned to level after fluctuating. General exchange dealers were constantly selling, so the morning opening rose to 6,750 yuan, then immediately retreated to 6,680 yuan. Tianyuan increased its position, slightly rebounding at midday. Fluctuations of more than ten yuan occurred in the afternoon, and the market closed at 2:45 PM at 6,700 yuan, a slight decrease of 5 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange market reported a soft tone after the close, so the off-market price rose to 6,730 yuan. Total trading volume was about 3,000 taels. Initially, Xinyili sold 10 taels to Defu in cash, with a premium of 40 yuan for delivery on schedule. Later, Baokang bought 130 taels from Yongfeng, also with a premium of 40 yuan. At midday, Xinyili suddenly re-sold 200 taels to Defu, with a premium of 50 yuan. In the afternoon, Defu again bought 130 taels from Yongfengyu and Yongfeng, with a premium of 45 yuan. Ornaments, Customs Gold, etc. remained flat.

Raw Gold Only Down Slightly by 5 Yuan

Continuing the firm tone after yesterday's close at the start of the morning, there were again reports that the foreign exchange market opened with a soft tone, and February American gold at 5.3125 yuan was difficult to settle. Bidding was enthusiastic at the counter, and the opening price soared to 6,750 yuan. However, it was difficult to maintain the high price because exchange dealers immediately entered the market to sell aggressively. Chengji, Hesheng, Dafeng, etc. supplied goods enthusiastically, and the price was pushed down to the 6,700 yuan mark, eventually falling to 6,680 yuan. However, silver firms at this time maintained their position well, buying a large number of goods at low prices. Tianyuan, Xinyili, and others all dragged in, gradually rising to just outside the 6,700 yuan mark, reaching 6,712 yuan. However, the exchange market returned to level from soft, and exchange dealers again started selling. They had previously bought in to cover their short positions, so the fall was very slight, retreating to just inside the 6,700 yuan mark, closing at 6,690 yuan. The market was quieter at midday, and there was still a lot of retail demand at the counter, settling at 6,700 yuan at the close. The opening was even quieter in the afternoon, with the price still at 6,700 yuan. For a while, the cash firms Shishi and exchange dealer Xinfeng slightly sold, retreating to 6,696 yuan. Later, Da and Fu, as well as some small money shops, slightly absorbed, and the price rose again, reaching 6,708 yuan, which was the high price for the afternoon. Because the silver firm Xiangxing was the only one selling, the price returned to 6,700 yuan, which was the evening closing price, around 2:45 PM. This was down 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The off-market was better after the close, trading around 6,720-30 yuan. The selling price of cash firms' own-brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than raw gold, while the purchase price was thirty yuan lower. The current standard gold was five to six ten yuan lower than the listed gold, but there was little trading.

Ornaments Still Unchanged

The price of gold for jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged from morning to night. Datonghang still hung 690 yuan, and the prices at Xintonghang were similar to the above, with a purchase price that was thirty yuan lower.

Hong Kong Notes Still in Strong Demand

Yesterday's foreign currency situation: the raw gold market price rose and then fell, but it trended upward again after the new opening, so the British and American gold pounds also rose by 0.5 jiao each. The British gold note was stable and unchanged, and the market price was flat. The American gold note once rose to 18.65 yuan in the afternoon, but eventually settled at 18.6 yuan, an increase of 0.12 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes remained in strong demand, and the market price continued to rise. The rising trend of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes did not stop. The former rose to 1.62 yuan, and the latter rose to 1.3 yuan.

### Yarn Flower Double Horse Sees New Price Again, Rumors that Factory Orders Continue to Open at 2,000 Bales

The yarn market continues to be strong, and the rising trend is still strong, so new highs continue to be set. This is because the price of fine cloth is expensive, which has aroused the activity of new buyers. At the same time, the actual demand is still not weak. However, most of the yarn bought by customers is 32-count fine yarn, followed by 23-count yarn, which is also not bad. However, the speculators are unusually excited. A major player in the securities industry turned from short to long. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,529 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,503 yuan. In the afternoon, it began to trade at 1,530 yuan, then fell to 1,515 yuan, and the final price was 1,522 yuan. It is rumored that Shenxin Factory of Double Horse has opened another 2,000 bales. It remains to be verified. Therefore, the sentiment has softened slightly. Today, there were five pieces of cotton yarn transported to Xiamen and 255 pieces transported to Hong Kong.

The morning opening of Double Horse: Because the sentiment was very good in the afternoon of the previous day, it continued to move forward. The first opening price was 1,506 yuan, but buyers came one after another. Under these circumstances, the market gradually rose to 1,519 yuan. At this time, those who were profitable came out to sell, and at the same time, it was heard that the price of gold had fallen back, gradually falling to 1,503 yuan. When the low price appeared at the counter, there were quite a few people who bought in to become temporary bulls. Near the close, when the chips were exhausted, the buying frenzy rose suddenly, rising to 1,528 yuan at the close. The statistics of transactions in the first half of the day show that 7,700 bales were traded. The amounts bought by each gang are recorded as follows:

Fellow Traders 7,100 Hong Kong 600

Total 7,700

### Cotton Market Prospering

The current cotton situation is trending firmer. General speculators are buying and selling each other, rising with the yarn market. At the same time, Chinese factories Xinhuo, Zhongfang, Shenxin Nos. 2 and 9, Xinsheng Factory, and Datong Yarn Factory all have considerable needs. Therefore, the market is prospering and sentiment is boosted. However, overseas purchases are still cheaper. Profit of dozens of yuan per picul could be made when cotton arrives to Shanghai. Therefore, overseas orders have been unusually active recently.

The New York cotton market rose initially due to purchases by fellow traders, then fell later due to the selling of southern gangs and the closing of long positions. The result was about 1-2 pounds lower compared to the previous day's closing price.

Indian cotton also fell due to cotton merchants selling, long positions taking profits, and continuous selling by a small number of speculators. Yesterday, the prediction was lowered by three and a half rupees.

The only reason for the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai is that the market lacks chips and the factories are eager for goods. Therefore, the activity of transactions in recent days has reached a fever pitch. As for the soaring prices of long-staple wool products, it is even more unexpected. Yesterday, high-grade middling used as raw material for 42-count cotton reached a high price of 385 yuan per picul. However, there were still many people competing to buy it.

### Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Soars, Taking Profits and Reselling

Yesterday, the factory cloth market hovered, and the morale was slightly relaxed. After several days of soaring prices, floating longs took profits and resold. However, the actual demand was still strong, so the selling was as firm as ever. The price of some white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill rose slightly by 0.2-0.5 yuan per piece. The price of bleached and dyed cloth also rose by 0.3-0.5 yuan. The price of this month's futures was about 0.5 yuan higher than the spot price. Nearly a thousand pieces of grey cloth and bleached and dyed cloth were traded on this street. The Wenzhou and Ningbo gangs on the Zhejiang Road traded more than a hundred pieces of colored cloth, poplin, and bleached cloth. The Fujian and Macau gangs traded more than 400 pieces of poplin, blue cloth, colored twill, and coarse and fine cloth. Merchants from other countries such as Singapore traded more than 2,000 pieces of khaki bleached cloth. 350 pieces of piece goods were transported to Hong Kong and 30 pieces were transported to Xiamen on the 5th.

The spot market for East cloth rose and then fell. As a result, the fine cloth still continued to rise by 0.5-1 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 52.4-5 yuan and fell to around 51 yuan at the close. However, the off-market was again tight, selling at 51.3-4 yuan. The futures at the exchange all fell at the noon close. In the afternoon, the market sentiment turned bullish, but on average, each month was down by 0.5-1.9 yuan. The closing market prices are as follows:

February 52.01 yuan

March 53.55 yuan

April 55.01 yuan

May 55.30 yuan

### Securities Public Debt Continues to Fall

The black market for public debt continued to be weak yesterday, with no signs of recovery. The negative rumors in the market have not yet subsided. Yuxing, Xinfu, Dahua, and others continue to have spot goods flowing out. Class C opened at 66 yuan and then continued to fall to 5.2 yuan, a fall of more than 1 yuan. Hongda and Lianyi slightly made up for their short positions at the counter, rising by 0.3-0.4 yuan. However, Runli, Yizhong, Renchang, and others continued to supply more chips, falling back by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Shengda, Xie Kang bought in to cover short positions, and then recovered by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The market situation was erratic. It can be seen that major players have extremely ample chips. Observing the market situation, major players are selling a considerable amount every day. They are afraid of squeezing the market price too low if they sell everything at once. Therefore, the future is probably not good yet. As a result, it continued to fall by 0.3-0.8 yuan. Only No. 96 was up by 0.25 yuan. The transaction volume was about 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.

The trading of stocks: 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded, with a price of 9 yuan.

London, 3rd (Monday) telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks were all flat and stagnant, and the market was generally unchanged.

### Seafood All Goods Open Red, All Rose

Since the closure of the settlement period, the opening red of seafood is at the end on schedule, as recently opened in each market with no fall and no retreat compared to last year. The volume of transactions in each area is also robust and stable.

(Mingyu) Sea Cucumber: Top Bald 580 yuan, Large 600 yuan to 560 yuan, Large-Mid 500 yuan, Mid-Bald 400 yuan · 380 yuan · 360 yuan, Small Bald 300 yuan to 280 yuan, Yellow Skin Jade Sea Cucumber Ludat 406 yuan, No. 1, 350 yuan, No. 2 no goods, No. 3, 306 yuan, No. 4, 276 yuan, Mid 220 yuan, (Dried Mussels) Departing Office 245 yuan, Large Mussels 235 yuan, Mid Mussels 220 yuan to 210 yuan, Small Mussels 200 yuan to 195 yuan (Sea Moss) Lion Mane 74 yuan, Flushed Lion Mane 70 yuan to 68 yuan, Dragon Sprout 58 yuan to 57 yuan, Wu Jiao 68 yuan to 59 yuan, (Tapioca Starch) Flying Unicorn Label 108 yuan, KG 102 yuan, Double TA 77 yuan, Double T 60 yuan, (Shrimp Tails) Xiangshan 420 yuan to 390 yuan, Tanabe Tails 440 yuan, (Western Fennel) 298 yuan, (Fujian Fragrant Mushrooms) 600 yuan, 580 yuan, Thick Mushrooms 700 yuan, 650 yuan, (Pepper) Black Large Pepper 125 yuan, 120 yuan, White Pepper 230 yuan, 215 yuan.

### Coal Indian Coal Returns to Original Price

Indian bituminous coal, the red opening saw once a virtual peak of 250 yuan, then through verified, the market was 245 yuan, according to the original plate only added 5 yuan, since recently the sales are limited, retail take advantage of the high to stock the goods, regrettably there are no buyers, it is also in vain, and so it reversed after the rise and back to the original, but back to the original 240 yuan, and has a dark panel, so the bituminous coal rose as a flash in the pan and returned to its former state said.

### Medicinal Materials Ginseng and Fungus Rise Again, White Bird's Nest Remains Level

Ginseng, bird's nest, and silver fungus have repeatedly risen in price due to the obstructed supply routes. Those with sufficient inventory last year had considerable surpluses, each earning 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. This year's red market opening has once again led to higher prices. However, the price increase of American ginseng is the highest, with some rising 40 to 50 yuan per catty. The market prices are listed below: American Ginseng Zheng Grade 440 yuan, 200 Grade 270 yuan, No. 1 Powdered Light 280 yuan, No. 2 Powdered Light 250 yuan, No. 3, 230 yuan, No. 4, 220 yuan, Wild Mountain Top Light 140 yuan, Seed Top Light 120 yuan. The rise in American ginseng is due to the added 20% on American exchange, Hong Kong exchange, and shipping costs. Although Sichuan silver fungus is now arriving, all businesses are optimistic about the price increase, so its price is also rising. Top-grade 210 yuan, Middle-grade 180 yuan, Low-grade 120 yuan. White bird's nest has not risen in price due to sluggish sales. Top-grade 110 yuan, Middle-grade 90 yuan, Low-grade 88 yuan. Because of the sale of Korean ginseng to Hong Kong, the tariff has increased, making large branches more sluggish. Heaven 15 branches 460 yuan, Heaven 20 branches 380 yuan. The above can be raised by 40 yuan. Heaven 30 branches 340 yuan, Heaven 40 branches 310 yuan. Small branches can be sold in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, raised 20 yuan per plate. Earth 15 branches 20 branches 350 yuan, can be raised by 25 yuan per plate. Earth 30 branches 320 yuan, 40 branches 290 yuan, 50 branches 260 yuan, can be raised by 20 yuan per plate. The above is the price per catty. (Nevertheless)

### Under Tight Security, the Taxpayers' Meeting Reopens Today; Western Attendees Expected to Be Numerous; Proposal for Increased Donations Expected to Pass Smoothly; Protest Lodged Regarding Arson Incident

The special meeting of Western taxpayers of the Public Concession convened on the 23rd of last month was adjourned after Lin Xiongji, opposing the second item on the agenda, the Municipal Council's proposal to "discuss increasing land tax and municipal general donations and special surcharges," delivered a speech, and the Chairman of the Municipal Council, K.S. Cornabe, also addressed the meeting in rebuttal. Subsequently, just as a vote was about to be taken on the amendment proposed by Lin, Lin Xiongji opened fire and shot at Cornabe, injuring several people, and the meeting was adjourned. Senior Consul Heill has now scheduled a reconvening for 2:30 PM today at the original location, the grandstand of the racetrack at 345 Jing'an Temple Road. He has solemnly declared that regardless of the weather, the meeting will not be postponed. Therefore, today's meeting is a continuation of the previous one, and the Japanese amendment will be discussed first. Regarding the question of whether the Japanese will attend, they have previously expressed their position. However, yesterday, rumors spread among foreigners that some Japanese would attend. However, Japanese newspapers indicated that they would oppose the passage of the Municipal Council's donation increase plan by refusing to attend, suggesting there would be no change in their position. Details are as follows:

Thorough Security to Prevent Disputes

According to police officials, strict security measures will be taken when the special taxpayers' meeting is held this afternoon. However, the Concession authorities declined to disclose the specific security measures to be taken at today's meeting. It is known that steel plates have been placed around the platform. Another report stated that police authorities claimed yesterday that all possible security measures would be taken at today's meeting, ensuring that disputes would not be repeated.

Three Items on the Meeting Agenda

Today's meeting will continue the agenda that was unfinished at the last meeting. The second item has two amendments: One proposed by Lin Xiongji and seconded by Futian suggests that the Municipal Council withdraw the donation increase proposal, temporarily borrow money to make up for the budget deficit, continue to implement government downsizing, and fundamentally study and reform the current tax system to create a fairer one for adoption. The other, proposed by Liddell and seconded by Arlington, requests a temporary increase of 40% in land tax for self-owned properties that have not been revalued since 1937. The third item is a discussion of the revised license fee proposal proposed by Liddell and seconded by Magnuson, requesting the abolition of the increased license fee for dairies. According to the Municipal Council's proposal, the annual license fee for each cow in "A" and "B" grade dairies would be 15 yuan, and for "A(T.T.)" grade cows, the annual fee would be 10 yuan.

Estimated 9,000 Attendees

Since this meeting continues from where the last one was interrupted, a quorum is not required, as stated by the Municipal Council. According to the Council, the total number of eligible votes for foreign taxpayers in the city is over 18,000, with the Japanese accounting for less than half. British, American, and other nationalities account for approximately 10,000. The last meeting was attended by over 4,500 taxpayers, with the Japanese accounting for one-third. It is expected that the reopening of today's meeting will see an increase in non-Japanese taxpayers due to the stimulation of the Japanese actions and the encouragement of Western media, with the total number of attendees reaching over 9,000.

Swift Passage Expected

Well-informed sources predicted yesterday that due to the absence of Japanese residents who oppose the proposal, it is expected to pass quickly at today's meeting. A senior Japanese official claimed yesterday that he had not received official reports on whether Japanese taxpayers would adhere to their original stance of non-participation, but stated, "As far as I know, the Japanese will not participate in this meeting." Municipal Council officials have previously stated that this meeting is merely a continuation of the last one, and therefore, no quorum is necessary.

Some Japanese Will Still Attend

According to the English-language *North China Daily News*, the Japanese Taxpayers' Association has officially resolved that Japanese will not participate in today's (5th) special meeting of foreign taxpayers. However, Japanese residents in the city stated yesterday (4th) morning, "Some Japanese will still attend," and added, "Japanese taxpayers are still strongly opposed to the Municipal Council's proposed increases in taxes and license fees." They did not indicate what steps the Japanese would take to prevent the passage of the donation increase resolution.

Voting on Japanese Proposal

It is heard that at the beginning of today's special meeting, a vote will be taken on the Japanese amendment opposing the donation increase (this proposal was rejected by a show of hands at the special meeting on January 23). After the vote, the special meeting will continue with the remaining agenda, discussing two other amendments that suggest revaluing the value of self-owned properties and no longer taxing dairies in the Public Concession.

Protest Lodged Regarding Arson at the Venue

Regarding the incident the day before yesterday (morning) when two Japanese attempted to set fire to the reed shed erected by the Municipal Council at the racetrack for the special meeting of foreign taxpayers, the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai has received a protest from the Municipal Council and is currently investigating it. Yesterday morning, Japanese officials refused to comment on the arson incident involving the two Japanese.

Japanese Police to Participate in Security

The Public Concession police authorities stated that they will take strict security measures during today's special meeting of foreign taxpayers at the racetrack. They did not disclose the specific measures, but it is understood that in addition to taking several special steps, they will also dispatch more Japanese police to guard the premises.

### French Women Respond to the Free French

Organizing the Lorraine Cross Association to Engage in Fundraising and Other Activities

According to the *Shanghai Mercury*, after France's armistice with Germany, General de Gaulle, leader of the pro-war faction, led the Free French forces to continue the resistance, using the famous "Lorraine Cross" as their emblem and "France Forever" as their slogan. Free French citizens throughout the Far East have responded enthusiastically, engaging in various patriotic activities. General de Gaulle recently appealed from London to Free French citizens to provide manpower and material resources to resist Germany, with excellent results. The response from Free French citizens in Shanghai has been particularly enthusiastic. When France announced the armistice, the Veterans Association of French Soldiers who had participated in the war sent a telegram to the Petain government, expressing their willingness to continue fighting. Subsequently, many French citizens in Shanghai participated in the de Gaulle movement. French women, patriotic and not to be outdone by men, have organized a women's group initiated by Madame Leonard, called the "Lorraine Cross Association," to engage in fundraising and other activities. They have sent 3,000 woolen sweaters, 100,000 boxes of cigarettes, and 1,000 yuan in Christmas慰勞金 to the Free French forces stationed in London. Three American women are members of the Lorraine Cross Association.

### French Ambassador to Visit Beiping

According to a Havas news agency dispatch from Shanghai, the French Ambassador to China, Cosme, arrived here on the 1st of this month and intends to stay here for several days to handle routine official business, before proceeding to Beiping. After arriving in Beiping, Counselor Pengu of the embassy will then go to Chongqing.

### Municipal Council Thanks Flour Mills

Fufeng and Fuxin Flour Mills Praised for Selling Flour at Stable Prices for the Benefit of Genuine Users

Last year, Fufeng and Fuxin Flour Mills, at the request of the Concession authorities, sold flour at stable prices throughout the year, greatly benefiting genuine users. The Municipal Council recently sent letters to the general managers of both mills, expressing its appreciation and hoping that they would continue to serve the community and sell flour at stable prices.

Regarding the sale of flour at stable prices, the Municipal Council and Fuxin and Fufeng Mills have agreed that, starting from the 3rd of this month, Fuxin will supply 5,873 bags daily, and Fufeng will supply 1,059 bags, except on Sundays. Each bag will cost 33 yuan from the factory, plus a handling fee of 30 cents. However, as the supply is slightly insufficient, users are only allowed to collect flour on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. (No flour will be distributed on Wednesday and Sunday). This information has been reported. It is known that Fufeng distributed 1,059 bags daily on January 31st and February 1st, and Fuxin distributed 5,000 bags daily, totaling 12,118 bags. These bags have not yet been sold. Therefore, an extra day of distribution will be added this Wednesday. As for the remaining 3,800 bags after the extra day of distribution, it is proposed that when the 7% allocation of foreign flour (of a quality similar to No. 2 flour in this street) reaches 4,518 bags, the two quantities will be combined to reach 8,318 bags, and another day of distribution will be added next Wednesday.

### Difficult Navigation Between Zhejiang and Fujian; "Minhe" Still Detained

"Xin'anli" and Other Merchant Vessels Have No Connection to "Minhe"

After the Japanese navy announced a blockade of the Zhejiang and Fujian coastlines in mid-July last year, ships such as *Xinxiangtai*, *Daxin*, *Haifu*, *Moufu*, and *Baoli* were detained by Japanese warships in Zhejiang waters and escorted to Zhoushan for surveillance. The longest detention was of *Xinxiangtai* lasting more than four months. They began to be released one after another at the end of last year and returned to Shanghai. Japanese warships search the sea rigorously, making navigation difficult. Therefore, the released vessels and other ships suspended sailing to pass the Spring Festival. After the holiday, they had to risk sailing for business purposes, but current freight volumes are light, expenses are high, and charter rates have doubled, causing merchants to suffer immensely. As for the Portuguese ship *Minhe*, it was detained by local troops in Fuqing at the beginning of last month and has not yet been released. The *Xin'anli* and *Xin'anna* two Ma-Le ships are purely merchant vessels operating under a lease and have no connection with the ship *Minhe*. Moreover, the nationality of each ship is different, and there is no question of cooperation.

### Shanghai West Special Police Force Expected to Be Established Soon; Bureau to Appoint Pan Da as Chief Director; All Illegal Locations in "Badlands" to Be Sealed Off

According to the English-language *North China Daily News*, the establishment of the Shanghai West United District Special Police Force is expected to be completed within the next three weeks. Reliable sources reveal that the Municipal Council is currently selecting senior officers for the Special Police Force. Pan Da (transliteration) will be appointed as Chief Director, Inspector Hall as Deputy Chief Director, Inspector Kresot in charge of the Detective Squad, and Inspector Zhang Bolan as Liaison Officer. In addition, the names of Chinese and Japanese officers appointed by the Municipal Council to the Special Police Force were not available yesterday (4th) morning.

Pan Da Familiar with Police Work

Pan Da's appointment as head of the United District Special Police Force was designated by the former "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an last year. Last year, when the "Cross-Boundary Roads Agreement" was expected to be implemented, Shen Da set up a general office at 34 Yidingpan Road. His cousin, Pan Zhiquan, a comprador with Jardine Matheson, who was kidnapped in the French Concession three weeks ago, remains missing. Pan Da has served as Deputy Chief of the Special Police Squad of the Municipal Council Police Department for approximately nine years and has considerable experience in Shanghai's police work. When traveling on the streets, he is always protected by bodyguards in two cars in front and behind the car he is riding in.

Continuing Discussions on Establishment Details

It is also heard that Municipal Council Police Chief Major Bowen and "Municipal Police Chief" Lu Ying will meet at the end of this week to discuss the details of the establishment of the Special Police Force. The two main points are the selection of other personnel for the Special Police Force and the establishment of police stations. Officials have announced that after the new police force is established, it will seal off all gambling dens and other illegal locations in the "badlands," regardless of whether they are established by foreigners or Chinese.

### *President Monroe* Makes Maiden Voyage to Shanghai; Shanghai-Vietnam Route Open; Due to Extraordinary Circumstances, No Tours Will Be Offered; Ships Sailing to the South Seas Operate as Usual

The American President Lines has built six new world-class liners. The first ship, *President Jackson*, made its maiden voyage to Shanghai on December 11th last year. It stayed in Shanghai overnight and left for the South Seas the next day (December 12th), returning to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope. It is estimated to have arrived in New York on the 2nd of this month and returned to Boston on the 3rd.

*President Monroe* Scheduled to Berth Tomorrow Morning

The second new ship, *President Monroe*, was launched from the same dock in Newport News on August 17th last year. It departed from Boston on December 24th last year for its maiden voyage to the East. It passed Kobe yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (6th) at 10:00 AM (delayed by one day from the scheduled voyage), berthed at buoys 12 and 13. Passengers will board the company's small boat and disembark at the Customs pier between 11:30 AM and noon tomorrow. After staying in Shanghai overnight, it will set sail for Hong Kong, Luzon, and various South Seas ports at 5:00 AM on the 7th, returning to Boston. The last small passenger boat will depart from the Customs pier at 1:00 AM on the 7th (midnight on the 6th). As it is curfew time, passengers may board an earlier boat, departing from the Customs pier at 9:00 PM on the 6th.

No Tours Allowed Due to Extraordinary Circumstances

The new liner's tonnage, speed, style, and equipment are the same as those of the *President Jackson*, and can be called sister ships. The company originally planned to host tours for various sectors of society upon its arrival, but due to the current extraordinary circumstances, it has been cancelled. Four more new ships are currently under construction. Also, the company's *President Coolidge*, a Pacific Liner returning from Luzon via Hong Kong, has also been delayed by one day and will arrive in Shanghai on the 8th and depart on the 9th, returning to the United States. The exact arrival time will be known when the ship sends a telegram.

French Ships Between Shanghai and Vietnam Operate on Schedule

There are rumors that the Japanese naval authorities will deploy ships to blockade the South China Sea and prevent foreign merchant ships from approaching, and that the transportation of cargo ships between Shanghai and Vietnam operated by the French Messageries Maritimes Company will also be blocked. According to a *Ping Ming News Agency* reporter's interview with the French Messageries Maritimes Company yesterday, the company's cargo ships *Kienting* and *Lothringen* recently sailed from Shanghai to Vietnam with cargo and have arrived in Haiphong and Saigon. The *D'Artagnan* has unloaded the prohibited food supplies in Shanghai and is scheduled to depart for Kobe, Japan on the morning of the 6th of this month. After returning to Shanghai, it will return south on a regular schedule. The *Bougainville* is scheduled to load miscellaneous goods in Shanghai on the 7th of this month and set sail for Haiphong and Saigon. This ship does not carry passengers. The cargo ship *Kindia*, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 6th of this month, has been delayed en route and will arrive on the 8th. Cargo ships *Si Kiang* and *Bangkok* are currently stationed in Saigon, waiting to load food supplies, and will continue to sail to Shanghai. Although the situation in Vietnam is tense, the company's ships continue to operate between Shanghai and Vietnam as usual, without any obstruction.

### Stabilizing People's Food Supply Proceeding Gradually; Over 100,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Cut Noodles Revised to 49 Cents per *Jin*

The people's food supply in Shanghai has only slightly improved. In order to plan for the future, the authorities intend to proceed in accordance with the established plan, which includes (1) unblocking the source of domestic rice, having recently consulted with the Shanghai "Municipal Government," which is still in progress; (2) assisting rice merchants and various people's food organizations to purchase and transport large quantities of foreign rice to Shanghai for sale; (3) cracking down on speculation and preventing illegal transactions in the market, requiring all rice merchants, regardless of whether they are selling futures or spot goods in the market, to release their stocks at the limited price, otherwise they will be punished according to law, without any leniency.

Over 100,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived Yesterday

Approximately 200,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai during the Spring Festival, and over 100,000 bags have continued to arrive after the holiday. Yesterday, the French ship *Valarena* arrived from Vietnam with over 30,000 bags of rice, the Italian ship *Deltadue* carried 54,000 bags of貢米, and the French ship *Vinh Thuan* transported over 17,000 bags of Siamese rice. Statistics show that over 100,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and over 300,000 bags have already been ordered and are expected to arrive in Shanghai continuously this month, so the current grain reserves in the city are very abundant.

Manipulation of Some Stored Rice

After the market opened yesterday, although rice prices did not exceed the new limited price, futures prices rose by two yuan compared to the previous day. If this is not curbed, the future is still uncertain. It is found that the daily transaction volume of Japanese rice in the market is consistently around 15,000 bags. Considering that the city's daily demand is only 9,000 bags, it exceeds the demand by 6,000 bags. In addition to rice stores purchasing a portion, a portion is also purchased by hoarders, leading to rising prices. Therefore, citizens generally hope that the authorities will immediately curb this. The absurd rumors circulating in the market, such as rising import prices and the Japanese side planning to levy taxes on貢米, must be suppressed to stabilize market prices.

1,000 Bags of Ordered Rice to Arrive in Three Days

The Shanghai Food Cooperative Association's third batch of 1,000 bags of ordered rice was loaded on a ship in Vietnam on the 3rd of this month, with a price of 98 yuan per bag, including war risk insurance, and will soon be distributed to the third batch of subscribers. There are approximately 100 bags remaining in the fourth batch. Those who wish to subscribe are urged to participate as soon as possible. Also, the method of distributing the first and second batches of rice that arrived provides that each bag for small subscribers is re-packaged, weighing exactly 198 *jin*. However, large subscribers were directly distributed at the dock on Lunar New Year's Eve and were not re-packaged, so some have sent letters stating that the rice is short. Once the association has completed the distribution of the first and second batches of rice, it will adjust the shortage. In the future, all arriving rice will be repackaged at the warehouse to ensure a weight of 198 *jin*, in order to ensure fairness.

Retail Price of Cut Noodles to Increase Starting Today

The Machine-Made Cut Noodles Industry Association states that the factory price of flour is 23 yuan per bag, plus a handling fee of 30 cents, totaling 23.30 yuan, which is 1.5 yuan higher than the previous flour price. With the consent of the authorities, it has been decided that, starting from February 5, the retail price of cut noodles in the market will be revised to 49 cents per *jin*. Members should sell in accordance with the prices set by the association and should not exceed the limit. As for the 126 newly registered businesses, the association will request the authorities to provide relief in order to universally assist civilians in the border areas. The stable price sale of flour by Fufeng and Fuxin Flour Mills has been reported. It is known that Fufeng distributed 1,059 bags daily on January 31st and February 1st, and Fuxin sold 5,000 bags daily, totaling 12,118 bags. These bags have not yet been sold. Therefore, an extra day of distribution will be added this Wednesday. As for the remaining 3,800 bags after the extra day of distribution, it is proposed that when the 7% allocation of foreign flour (of a quality similar to No. 2 flour in this street) reaches 4,518 bags, the two quantities will be combined to reach 8,318 bags, and another day of distribution will be added next Wednesday.

### Jin Huating's Remains to Be Encoffined This Afternoon; Remains Appear Lifelike After Makeup; Central Figures Send Condolences and Funeral Gifts

*Shen Bao* reporter Yu Huating was fatally shot by thugs at 4:30 AM the day before yesterday. When the sad news spread, all sectors of society, both Chinese and foreign, deeply mourned. His remains were moved from the small sickroom on Terrasse Road to the operating room of the Shanghai Funeral Home at noon yesterday. Several relatives and friends, with grief-stricken faces, were tearfully taking care of the situation at the scene. When reporters visited before 4:00 PM yesterday, they saw that Mr. Jin's remains had been made up by technicians, and his appearance was lifelike, inspiring respect. Yesterday, people from all walks of life visited in an endless stream, expressing their deep regret. This shows how deeply Mr. Jin had touched people's hearts on a daily basis. The encoffining of the remains is scheduled for 3:00 PM this afternoon. Mr. Jin's relatives and friends have organized a funeral committee to handle everything.

Central Figures Send Telegrams of Condolence

(Chongqing, 4th) After the tragic news of the *Shen Bao* reporter Jin Huating being shot and killed spread, all sectors of society here deeply mourned. Wang Shijie, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Deputy Ministers Pan Gongzhan and Dong XianGuang, and Central Committee members Jiang Bocheng and Wu Kaixian have respectively requested the Central Government to issue an order of commendation and provide preferential compensation. Mr. Wang and others also sent telegrams to Shanghai expressing their condolences and funeral gifts. The original telegrams are as follows: (1) To the *Shen Bao* in Shanghai, forwarded to the Jin family: Mr. Huating was an outstanding talent for the Party and the country, a prominent figure in the press, with a loyal nature and strong determination. His tragic death is deeply mourned. In addition to requesting the Central Government to issue an order of commendation and provide preferential compensation, we hereby offer a funeral gift of 2,000 yuan in advance, hoping that you will restrain your grief and take care of important matters. Shijie, Gongzhan, XianGuang, kowtow; (2) We are shocked and deeply saddened to hear of Mr. Huating's tragic death. Mr. Huating was upright, hated evil like an enemy, and was highly respected in the media. His death is heavier than Mount Tai, but his righteousness will live on forever and serve as a model, which is worthy of no regret. We hereby offer a funeral gift of 3,000 yuan in advance, and will separately request the Central Government to issue an order of commendation. Respectfully send condolences, hoping that you will restrain your grief. Bocheng, Kaixian, kowtow together.

Wu Shaoshu Speaks

(Hong Kong, 4th) Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, was shocked and saddened to hear in Hong Kong that *Shen Bao* reporter Jin Huating had been shot and killed by thugs. He immediately sent a telegram to Mr. Jin's family to express his condolences and sent a funeral gift of 1,000 yuan. According to Mr. Wu's conversation with reporters, since Shanghai became an isolated island, the press has been repeatedly devastated and oppressed, and loyal people have been tragically killed, including Mr. Zhu Xinggong, Zhang Sixu, Cheng Zhenzhang, and Shao Xubai. Now that Mr. Jin has sacrificed himself for his beliefs, the thugs' murder of outstanding talents is truly hateful. Mr. Jin was a well-known figure in the Chinese press, a loyal and upright person with a strong will. In recent years, he had been repeatedly targeted, but he persevered and never withered. This spirit of loyalty, courage, and determination is a model for the world. Although he sacrificed his life for the country, his righteousness will remain in the world, and his death is heavier than Mount Tai.

Colleagues and Friends Send Letters and Telegrams of Condolence

Yesterday, the Jin family funeral committee received letters and telegrams of condolence from colleagues in the press and friends from all over the world, including: (1) Bloom, manager of Reuters, wrote that Mr. Jin's tragic death was a great loss to the press; (2) the *Zhongmei Daily* sent a letter expressing deep grief and extending sincere condolences upon hearing of Mr. Jin's death; (3) Chen Xunyu from Hong Kong sent a telegram expressing his grief and sorrow at Mr. Jin's misfortune; (4) Zhang Changren from Hengyang sent a telegram expressing his deep sorrow upon hearing the sad news of the death of his brother Huating. In addition, those who sent funeral gifts included Pu Jiting, the Nanjing Road Reading Room, and several anonymous donors.

### First Special Court Bombing Case: Driver Suspected and Detained, Rental Car Permit Found Outside Criminal Court Wall,祥泰 Motor Company Previously Hijacked by Robbers

On the third of this month, a little after 4:00 AM, three hand grenades were thrown at the open space outside the criminal court of the First Special District Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai on North Zhejiang Road, and the civil court on Weihaiwei Road. Although they exploded at the time, no one was injured. After investigation by the Jing'an Temple Police Station and the Huishi Police Station, it was determined that the two cases were related and committed by the same person. A suspect, Zhou Weishan from Tongzhou, was arrested and escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. According to Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station,

Presented the Case,

Stating that before the incident at the civil court of the First Special Court on Weihaiwei Road, a Chinese policeman with badge number 1801 witnessed a car, number 1801, traveling very quickly from east to west. As it approached the civil court, the car suddenly slowed down, and then the bombing occurred, making a loud noise. Subsequently, six long gun bullets were found outside the affected wall. Furthermore, at around 6:00 AM on the 3rd, the suspect Zhou Weishan was apprehended. Investigations revealed that Zhou lived at No. 80 in Longzhi Lane, Kang'nou Road, and worked for

祥泰 Motor Company

at No. 566 Weihaiwei Road as a driver. The car he drove, No. 17744, was hired out at 12:00 AM on February 2nd and returned at 5:00 AM the next morning. However, there was a piece of paper pasted on the car's license plate, most of which had been torn off. It appeared that the number had been altered during use. However, Zhou confessed to the police station that he drove to the United Overseas Chinese Association at No. 6 Difeng Road to pick up a fare on the night of the 2nd. Suddenly, two people came to hire the car, and when they drove to Yanping Road, four more people came. One of them

Threatened with a Gun,

Bound Zhou's hands and blindfolded him. These people drove themselves to a certain place, stopped the car, and pushed Zhou into a room. At 5:00 AM, these people returned, still forced Zhou into the car, and released him at Xiaoshadu Road, Laobosen Road, threatening him not to report to the police, otherwise they would retaliate. Zhou then drove back. Later, after the criminal court of the First Special Court was also bombed, the police station found a rental car certificate from the祥泰 Motor Company outside the wall,

Specifying the Car Number

As 17744, and the time as 10:00 PM on February 2nd. The driver's name was Zhou Fushan, who was Zhou Weishan's older brother. Now, because the name of the driver and the time on the rental car do not match, the police station must continue the investigation, so he requested permission to detain him. Zhou Weishan confessed to the above situation. The magistrate verified the confession and ordered Zhou to be detained pending further investigation for seven days.

### British Subject Hawkins Accused of Operating Gambling Den, British Consular Police Court Opened Trial Yesterday

The English newspaper "Great Evening News" reported that British subject Hawkins, residing in Shanghai, was accused by the Public Concession Police Department in British Consular Police Court of violating the "Gambling Law" by operating gambling dens in Room 2B, No. 204 Seymour Road, and Rooms 112, 114, and 116 of the Cangzhou Hotel.

### Robbery and Arrest on Laobosen Road, One Thief Shot on the Spot, Stray Bullet Injures a Man

Yesterday afternoon around 6:00 PM, two robbers suddenly broke into No. 1683 Yinghua Lane on Laobosen Road, Xuhui. One robber brandished a gun to intimidate, intending to rob. The victim immediately shouted for help. The robbers panicked and, before they could steal anything, rushed out to escape. Nearby Chinese police officers had already arrived after hearing the alarm and bravely stepped forward to arrest them. The robbers immediately opened fire to resist arrest, and the Chinese police officers also drew their guns and fired back. The two sides exchanged fire. As a result, one robber, named Chen Jinbao, 26 years old, was shot in the abdomen. The other robber escaped without a trace. Afterwards, a suspect was apprehended nearby. During the confrontation, Wang Yinsong, a 32-year-old man from Jiangbei who lived at No. 12 Yinghua Lane, was going out when he was struck in the chest by a stray bullet. The police summoned an ambulance to take Wang Yinsong to Baolong Hospital. The injured robber was sent to the police hospital for treatment.

### Cantonese Man Zeng You Arrested for Extorting Gambling Dens, Husband and Wife Quarrel and Reveal Secret, Explosives Found, Both Detained for Further Investigation

Zeng You, a Cantonese man, was idle and did nothing. Seeing the proliferation of gambling dens in Shanghai, he conceived a way to make easy money. He specially made a type of explosive and carried it to various gambling dens to intimidate them. If they did not pay him money, he would use the explosives against them. Therefore, the gambling dens feared his power and

Paid Monthly Allowances.

The largest payer was the Six Nations Hotel, which paid 400 yuan per month. The others paid varying amounts ranging from a hundred to several tens of yuan. Zeng would issue receipts stating that he had received a certain amount of labor money from a certain gambling den, with the name of the Guang Tianzi Hall or the Guangdong Five Tigers Hall written below. In total, his monthly income was no less than several thousand yuan. Zeng had a concubine, Ms. Xu, 29 years old, who lived with him at No. 153 Guling Road. Recently, their relationship suddenly broke down. At 2:20 PM the day before yesterday, near Guling Road and Beihe Road, they had a big quarrel. Detective Wang Xianliang and Chinese policeman No. 139 saw them and

Arrested Both of Them.

A package of yellow explosive powder was found on Xu's person. They then went to their residence and found ten Guang Tianzi Hall and other seals, as well as five receipts from Dafaco Company Liyuan Gambling Den, etc. They were taken to the Xinzha Police Station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Dayin presented the case and requested detention. The court approved the detention of both defendants pending further verification in seven days.

### Young Man Steals Clothes to Gamble, Chops Cousin to Death

At around 7:00 AM yesterday, a blood case occurred in Qiwun Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha Road, where a cousin chopped his cousin to death. The ins and outs of the case are as follows: Lin Wei, a Ningbo native, 25 years old, lived in a garret on the second floor of No. 16 in the lane. His monthly income was barely enough to make ends meet. Lin had a cousin, Qiu Xiangbiao (24 years old). Three years ago, Qiu was destitute and homeless, so Lin took him in and introduced him to a job to earn a living. Recently, Qiu suddenly became addicted to gambling, frequenting various gambling dens and losing repeatedly. He resorted to low tactics. The night before last, while Lin was fast asleep, Qiu stole Lin's wool overcoat and pawned it to gamble and lost the money. At around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, Lin got up and discovered that his clothes were missing. Knowing it was Qiu's doing, he questioned him, and an argument ensued. The argument turned into a physical fight. Qiu, young and impetuous, disregarding the consequences, suddenly used a kitchen knife to slash at Lin wildly, about fifty or sixty times, leaving Lin covered in blood. The roommate discovered the situation, gathered people, and apprehended Qiu while reporting to the police and summoning a car to send the injured Lin to Baolong Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, Lin died upon arrival at the hospital.

Respectfully announcing that our factory's retail department, on January 26th (i.e., the last day of the lunar year) at 4:00 PM, in the midst of a busy business day, suddenly discovered a bundle of banknotes left on the counter.

### Lester School Student Zhang Haizhong Nearly Kidnapped, Bandits Broke into School Attempting Kidnapping, Teachers Called Police, Kidnappers Fled in Panic

Zhang Haizhong, a 14-year-old student in the third grade of junior high school at Lester School of Technology, No. 505 East Xi Huade Road, Yuanfang Road, Hongkou, is the second son of Zhang Gongruo, the current Chinese General Manager of Yizhong Tobacco Company. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, while Haizhong was chatting with classmates on campus, four kidnappers suddenly rushed into the school with weapons, dragged Zhang out, and attempted to kidnap him. Fortunately, a teacher at the school, Aimes, saw this and shouted "robbers" from the window. The kidnappers then drew their guns and fired two shots as a warning, fortunately without injuring anyone. After the four robbers fled, they unexpectedly encountered a patrolling Japanese marine corps unit passing by and dared not take the hostage with them. They abandoned the child and fled in all directions without a trace. The Zhang student was unharmed and returned to school. Soon after, the police received the news and dispatched a large team of Chinese and foreign detectives to search the scene of the incident and block the bridges over the Suzhou Creek for a search. They arrested one armed bandit and took him to the police station for investigation. It was then learned that the bandit was not the perpetrator of the previous case because the bullets in his gun were not the same as those used by the previous case. The search for the bandits' whereabouts is still underway.

### Jiangsu Department of Education Follows Orders to Implement High School and Junior High School Teaching Subject Table (1), Schools to Implement, Study, and Improve as Necessary

(North Jiangsu Correspondence) The Jiangsu Department of Education recently received from the Ministry of Education the revised teaching subjects and hours table for high schools and junior high schools. It stipulates that starting from the 29th academic year, first-year students in high schools and junior high schools should immediately follow it. Other grades will remain the same for the time being. The main points of the new table are two: one is that English is changed to an elective course in junior high school, and the other is that teaching is divided into groups, with Group A emphasizing mathematics and science. For the convenience of implementation, the Department of Education has also issued a set of important points to note during implementation and circulated them for implementation. The details are recorded separately below:

Important Points to Note During the Implementation of the High School and Junior High School Teaching Subject and Hours Table Promulgated by the Ministry

1. Schools with dual tracks should divide students into Group A and Group B for teaching based on their academic ability and interests. 2. Schools with only a single track may select one of the Group A and Group B implementations and report it for record. 3. Schools should indicate the group being recruited in the recruitment brochure when enrolling students. 4. When implementing this revised teaching subject and hours system, schools should adhere to the spirit of experimentation, study and improve it at any time, and submit a summary report to the Department of Education for record at the end of the academic year.

Junior High School Teaching Subject and Weekly Teaching Hours Table for Each Semester (Revised and Promulgated on February 1, 29th year of the Republic [1940])

(Instructions) (1) Elective hours are divided into Group A and Group B in each academic year, approximately 3 hours each week.

In the second and third years, Group A has 1 hour of Civics and 2 hours of Vocational Studies, while Group B has 3 hours of foreign language. (2) Natural Sciences may adopt integrated teaching. If departmentalized teaching is adopted, the content of Natural History should include the basics of geology and mineralogy in addition to animals and plants. (3) Within the total teaching hours of History and Geography, domestic history and geography should account for about five-sixths, and foreign history and geography should account for one-sixth. (4) In addition to physical education, Boy Scouts, and morning exercises or between-class exercises, physical training should include 3 hours of extracurricular sports and Boy Scout exercises per week. (5) In addition to manual arts and vocational subjects, productive labor training should include 3 hours of extracurricular practice per week.

(8) The arrangement of teaching time for each subject should be as reasonable as possible, that is, Chinese, Mathematics, Science, Civics, History, and Geography should be arranged during the most effective hours for studying (such as 8-11 AM and 2-3 PM). In addition, for subjects such as Physical Education, Boy Scouts, and Manual Arts that have extracurricular activities, exercises, and practice, the time may be mixed and allocated, and the time for each teaching activity may be extended to one and a half or two hours as appropriate.

### Provinces Emphasize Training of Public Education Center Staff

(Chongqing, 4th) The cause of public education centers in various provinces was previously regulated by the Ministry of Education's promulgation of laws and regulations and the specification of work standards. The Ministry of Education has sent personnel to supervise and guide it at any time, and it has made considerable progress. It is now learned that Shaanxi, Gansu, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Henan, Shandong, and Xikang provinces have complied with the Ministry of Education's circular, paid special attention to the training of public education center staff, and successively opened training classes. All of them have been successively approved by the Ministry of Education and provided with supplementary funds. It is expected that the results of this professional training will be even more impressive.

### Jingjiang Middle School Raises Student Standards

The private Jingjiang Middle School on Shanzhong Road, Haig Road, was founded by the Zhenjiang financial community. It has sufficient funds and a stable school foundation. It has hired Zhang Cheng, who has served as the principal of famous provincial schools in Jiangsu for many years, as the principal. Since opening classes in Shanghai, due to the principal's responsibility, excellent teachers, strict management, and serious curriculum, the number of students has increased dramatically every term. In order to improve the students' level for the purpose of further education or employment, the high school section, in addition to teaching the subjects according to the Ministry's standards, also has advanced chemistry, advanced physics, advanced biology (all of which are freshman-year university courses), and English elective courses to make up for arithmetic and bank bookkeeping, as well as holding essay competitions. Students attend class all day, have no time to wander around, and are therefore praised by parents who strictly urge their children to study. It is reported that the school is currently recruiting transfer students for all grades of high school and junior high school, and there are still vacancies. However, there is a shortage of beds for boarding students due to the excessive number of boarders.

### Xiqing Basketball League: Huaxing to Face Little Bears Tonight, Huaxing vs. Maihong at 8:15

There will be two games in the Xiqing Basketball League tonight. The perennial champions Huaxing will meet the Little Bears, starting at 7:15. Since the return of Fu Jinsheng and others, Huaxing's strength has become even more abundant. The pillars of the Little Bears team, Carson and Yenic, left Shanghai a few days ago. The entire team relies solely on Toblin Ge to support it. The lineup is sparse and scattered and is no match for Huaxing. The other game is Shangxing vs. Mailand Hong. The two teams are evenly matched and can be called evenly matched. Meeting at that time, a fierce battle is inevitable. The league is coming to an end, and the championship will depend on the game between Maijun Guan and Huaxing. Maijun has already won two runner-up finishes. The defending champion, Paramount, has been unable to support itself since Li Zhenzhong and Bao Songyuan left this year and ranks fourth. The Little Bears are still ahead of them. If Shanghai Star can defeat Paramount, it can also jump ahead of them. Mailand Hong has been in last place for a long time. Tonight's schedule is as follows:

Huaxing Team - Little Bears Team 7:15 PM

Shangxing Team - Mailand Hong 8:15 PM

### Western Union Football: Recent Situation of Each Group

Western Union Football, Group A: Donghua's championship this year has begun to waver. I hope the Donghua athletes will take care of themselves. There are still three games against Portugal, Beixi Children, and Xibu. If good news is spread, there is still hope for the championship. The preliminary group is idle. The entire schedule will be completed. Donghua's two games against Xibu and Saint Francis are also related to the future of the championship. Beixi Children has steadily won the last place. Group B: The British Navy quickly won two games, and the score increased sharply, jumping to second place. The French Army and Youyou Club have successively fallen behind by one place. The Park United has now fallen to the bottom. Group C: Ruowensi still sits firmly on the throne. Weituoning and Osmont have the same scores and closely follow behind. The Hua Team, Yizhong, and Zhendan Team are ranked fourth and fifth. The Hualian Team and others have played fewer games and may become champions in the future. The recent situation of the three groups is as follows:

### Pei Cheng Cup Women's Table Tennis: Feng Mingyin Wins Championship, Gui Rongzheng Runner-Up, Zhang Lizhi Third Place

The Pei Cheng Cup Senior Group Individual Table Tennis Championship held by Pei Cheng Girls' Middle School was attended by a total of ten people. The top five winners were determined by a single round-robin system to decide the champion, runner-up, and third place. After many days of round-robin battles, the final match was held between Feng Mingyin and Feng Huizhu in the school auditorium the day before yesterday. There were many visitors and the situation was lively. Chen Linsheng served as the referee. Feng Mingyin was good at both offense and defense, and her hitting posture was excellent. She is indeed an outstanding talent who has emerged recently. Feng Huizhu is good at chopping balls and was originally a strong team, but unfortunately, her wrist was injured earlier, and her performance was abnormal, resulting in three consecutive losses. In the final battle, Feng Mingyin became more and more courageous and won a great victory, winning the championship of the cup. Feng Huizhu retreated to fifth place. The results of the final battle and the complete list of winners are recorded below:

Spring and Autumn

### Gilded Teeth: The Crime

— Manqing

There was a time when it suddenly became popular to gild teeth. The shiny enamel was electrically etched and then covered with a gold shell. So, when speaking, people would deliberately laugh more, revealing their cherry lips and the brilliant golden light, looking very pleased with themselves. In fact, if you talk about beauty, the "arranged shells" in old novels were definitely not golden. If you talk about being aristocratic, the price of gold at that time was only a dozen yuan per tael. How much could this thin gold shell be worth? However, because it was "popular," when people opened their mouths, even their canine teeth were subjected to the "beautiful" electric torture. Many dentists also made their fortunes because of it.

Once the enamel is damaged, it causes endless trouble. The dentist becomes a medical consultant, and visits to Ramón y Cajal are a normal expense. However, even now, there are unexpected gains, that is, this thin gold shell has increased at least thirty times in value. When there is no rice for dinner, you can knock it off and pawn it. If you want to make light of it, it is "speculation."

But there are two sides to the story. Precisely because it is easy to pawn, in addition to "skinning pigs," "skinning field chickens," and "skinning ears" (gun earrings), "skinning teeth" was also invented - knocking your teeth out, root and all. This bloody punishment was probably not what people expected when they were learning to be "beautiful," right? In the past, they were "always laughing," but now it is too late to close their bird mouths.

Writing this, I remembered an ancient saying, called "Don't show your wealth." You are speculating today and speculating tomorrow. Aren't the people next to you eyeing your piled-up wealth? What is the crime of the teeth? Gilding teeth is the crime. Isn't it an even better deal to pull this piled-up wealth out by the roots?

### Flight

— Luo Lin

Today, the group in this mansion are like headless flies, everyone wearing a look of extreme panic, packing things, pulling things east and dragging things west, in a state of utter confusion and fear. Damn it! We just escaped "disaster" last month, and today we have to "flee" again.

Early this morning, just as Boss Zhang was about to ask Ah Lin to drive the car out, a strange letter suddenly arrived. Boss Zhang opened it and took a look, so frightened that his "celestial official"-like face turned the color of a preserved egg. — Boss Zhang often told people that his face was like that of a celestial official — it turned out that the "heroes" were coming to "borrow provisions" again. Yikes! Two hundred and fifty thousand! How could he possibly afford that! He remembered that it wasn't long ago that he had already "borrowed" money to them, and now they were coming again, truly not caring about the life or death of others! Alright, he wouldn't go to the office today. He picked up the phone to call, but today, for some unknown reason, it was like seeing a ghost, he dialed the wrong number three times in a row, and couldn't get through. Boss Zhang's friends advised him to quickly avoid the limelight, a wise man doesn't fight when the odds are against him, it's not worth fighting with them, is it?

"Abao, quickly go upstairs and call the wife and mistresses to get up, but don't shout loudly."

"Wh...what?..."

"Go quickly, damn it!"

"Yes..."

"This is terrible, those women can't stand being frightened, they're all those killers, sigh!"

"Ah, another letter, two hundred and fifty thousand!" The wife saw the strange letter on the table and jumped up in fright.

"Don't shout, quickly...quickly pack up, pack up, and come with me to avoid them, we'll talk about it later."

"Go to ××?"

"No... that's the long room we opened, they must know about it."

"Then..."

"Never mind, go quickly, go quickly!"

Finally, with great effort, like thieves, they escaped into a relatively quiet hotel, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

"Mom, when I grow up, I'm going to buy a big Guan Dao and kill all the robbers." The young master was quite knowledgeable about martial arts, and everyone laughed.

— Written by Fan Yan

"Don't talk nonsense, what does a child know!" The boss hurriedly stopped him, really, if the news got out, that would be terrible!

"Bang," the boss put down the soda water, and thought to himself, there were still some things to discuss. That's right, fleeing was important, but business was even more important, especially with such big fluctuations these days. So he picked up the phone:

"Hello, Old Wang? I'm at ×× Hotel, Room ××, what's the situation with "Citibank" today? ...Eighteen and a half yuan? Good, sell it off for me...

"Four hundred and twenty Shuangma? Don't sell, don't sell!...

"I won't thank you for dinner tonight, I'll come again the day after tomorrow. I'm not sure if I'll be here tomorrow; alright, goodbye."

After finishing the phone call, the boss returned to his "celestial official" smile. Well, "fleeing but not forgetting to make money," it doesn't matter if you spend a little if you can make a fortune!

"Ah Lin, go and order some dishes for me, and bring two bottles of wine, but you must not talk nonsense outside!"

"Understood." Ah Lin took the banknotes and left, but he thought to himself: "Easy come, easy go, if we escape this trouble, there will be another one, it's all the same anyway."

### Ordinary Things

— Zhi Xuan

This is an ordinary day. It is not in ancient times, nor is it a legend, but it is happening now; people cannot find anything special about it in their hearts, it is such an ordinary day.

In the evening, the street lights are shining brightly in the night, pedestrians and vehicles are going their separate ways, when suddenly, in a flatbread shop, a woman screamed. At that time, a figure sneaked into the alley opposite; then a man from the shop rushed out from inside and chased after him into the alley. After a while, he dragged a man out, the man had a head of upright long hair, a dirty black face, and a tattered cotton coat, making it clear at a glance what kind of person he was. He was trembling all over, holding two bitten flatbreads in his hands, which made it clear what had happened. Some people watched from afar, while others gathered around to watch; but the man did nothing else, only cursed loudly.

Such things are not surprising. I have also seen a person on a deserted road, also a ragged figure, snatching fried dough sticks and running away, and someone chased after him, but did not catch him. It's all the same, nothing surprising.

I have also heard of huge robberies, where a huge amount of money was robbed, many police officers were mobilized, and the newspapers used large headlines. That is surprising, because it is a huge amount.

But I am surprised, surprised by the people who rob flatbreads and fried dough sticks. Why are their goals so small? Disregarding the law, concerning their lifelong reputation and credit. This is a huge sacrifice, they sacrifice everything for the sake of some small flatbreads and fried dough sticks, and this is worth pondering.

Every day, on the road, stretching out their hands, making pitiful pleas, tracking pedestrians, these things are countless. In front of the rice shops, enduring whips, enduring long hours of waiting, but only for some food. The crowd is like a long snake, stretching across many storefronts. This is most evident, making people realize that there is a boundless and huge shadow.

If someone is surprised by huge robberies, then they should be even more alarmed by such things as robbing flatbreads and fried dough sticks. Because behind these ordinary things, the things that follow are frightening to an unimaginable degree.

3. The Concubine of the Garrison Commander

This year, Ms. Hou, the principal of Tianjin Provincial Women's Normal School — a fifty-two-year-old spinster — unfortunately made a big mistake unintentionally, but the bad consequences of this big mistake did not affect her personally, but ruined one of her most proud female students; therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that it was a prank.

However, whether before or after the event, Ms. Hou always said, "I had good intentions, I had good intentions." This is not entirely false! The old lady did have good intentions, but unfortunately she did not know that good intentions can sometimes harm people, and even kill people!

The beginning of the matter was just a very ordinary commemorative meeting.

Because the Provincial Women's Normal School was "provincial," it was inevitably somewhat official. Whenever the opening ceremony, graduation ceremony, and all commemorative meetings were held, the local top officials, such as the governor and the military governor, had to be invited to the school, carried into the auditorium like gods, and enshrined for an hour or two, just to borrow their power to make the various ceremonies seem more solemn.

This time was the school's fifth anniversary. Principal Hou, who had always disliked entertainment, firmly rejected the suggestions of the other teachers and refused to add any entertainment programs after the commemorative ceremony. She felt that the purpose of running a school was only to teach students to read, and those vaudeville-like dances and songs were simply superfluous: if she allowed them to perform publicly in front of so many people, it would not only embarrass themselves, but also make her — Principal Hou — lose face. Therefore, this fifth anniversary meeting was still a monotonous series of "ringing the bell to start the meeting, bowing three times to the national flag, the principal's report, the officials' speeches..." Among them, the more interesting ones were the three programs of singing the national anthem, the school song, and the students' thank-you speech: the student's thank-you speech was originally not included, but because this commemorative meeting happened to be held before the summer vacation, it was also used as the graduation ceremony for the fourth graduating class, and the governor was asked to give certificates, and a representative was elected from the students to give a speech of thanks.

Entertainment Circle

### Mrs. Temple Talks About Shirley Temple's Future

— Qing Hui

Since Shirley Temple officially left Fox Company last year and entered Westlake School for Girls, I have already reported on her school life in this column, but I think her future is also a matter of concern to general movie fans. Mrs. Temple — Shirley's mother — has different plans for her daughter's future. She frankly told us:

"Shirley is not tired of the film industry, but we feel tired, we want her to retire for a year or two to rest. When I explained to her under the lights that George (Shirley's father) and I planned to retire for two years, she opened her eyes as wide as an owl and was silent for a long time before whispering, 'I hope to make movies again soon.' I know she will be unhappy if she doesn't work, making movies is as important as life to her. She is so sincere, but this is what I want to declare, I must use better opportunities to make her career shine.

"Regarding her future, there are currently two decided plans: first, because Shirley still misses the film industry, she will make one movie a year, or at most three movies in two years, but Shirley must have the best script, and there are very few suitable ones at present, so we don't want to sign a long-term contract, but we prefer to sign a per-film contract. Second, because Shirley felt infinitely happy singing 'Silent Night' with Nelson Eddy last Christmas, she may appear on the radio next spring, but the new agreement still needs to be discussed and finalized, and the programs to be broadcast have not been arranged, perhaps broadcasting a children's drama, she can broadcast and sing in her original form. In short, we still put her studies first, and making movies and broadcasting are secondary.

"In addition, several Hollywood film companies want to win Shirley over, but we have rejected them all and have not signed any contracts. As for someone saying that she will join Universal Company, that is also unbelievable, she is just fulfilling her appointment with producer Paneschnik, and will co-star in a film with Deanna Durbin and Greer Garson."

Finally, Mrs. Temple solemnly said: "Even if Shirley returns to the screen in the future, I want her to play real, modern stories with acting skills, and no more of the children's comedies like before."

### Statement of Clarification

We received a letter yesterday from the "Yunhai Drama Society" stating: Upon reading the letter from the "Fudan Drama Society" published in your January 31st issue, it stated that Mr. Huang Jiaxiang is not a member of the "Fudan Drama Society." After investigation, our society is a drama society organized by students of Fudan Experimental Middle School after school, and Mr. Huang Jiaxiang serves as the director-general. After investigation, students of Fudan Experimental Middle School can also be called Fudan students. On January 11th, your journal published an introduction to "Floating Clouds and Flowing Water" and referred to "Fudan students," without mentioning "Fudan Drama Society," and no error was made. It is appropriate to submit a statement as above.

### Anecdotes from the Art World

— Shou Wu

Minhua Company built a very elaborate stage in the studio to shoot "Song of Ancient China," which attracted many movie fans who were eager to show off their skills on it. Under suggestion, it was unanimously approved, so this show was decided. However, as for the date, the Lantern Festival is probably too late. First, "Song of Ancient China" will definitely not be finished before the Lantern Festival. If such a carnival is inserted in the middle, it will be time-consuming and cause unemployment, and the loss will be too great. Second, several of the people participating in this carnival program are "novices." "Novices" are not afraid of being laughed at, but to make people laugh and watch it, it still takes several days of "hard work." Therefore, it seems that the realization of this rehearsal will be after the completion of the work at the "Song of Ancient China" film studio.

Several film practitioners performed "Thunderstorm" at the Ningbo Fellow Association, and the business was very good, so they worked harder and performed "Spring Comes to the World" again starting today. It is expected that soon after, such public performances will be like "bamboo shoots after rain."

I met Wu Chengda and Shen Qi on the road, and when talking about Minhua's carnival program, Wu and Shen volunteered and said that they would also participate in a program and invite Ms. Sun Jinglu and Mei Xia to co-star in "Double Five Flower Cave," but the opportunity has not yet matured, and this "ideal play" can only be announced after Ms. Sun and Mei agree.

Wu Yonggang directed "Red Powder Golden Ge," starring Wang Xichun and Shu Shi, etc. It is now being adapted and improved into a Peking opera by Pei Chong.
