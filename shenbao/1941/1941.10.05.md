(4th) Foreigners who once underestimated Japanese power have now realized their past mistakes. The "Evening News" mocked the various propaganda claims made by the Japanese regarding the battle in northern Hunan, and stated that Changsha's strategic position is extremely important. If the Japanese army is driven back to its original positions, then Japan and the Japanese army will fundamentally lose their value. The Japanese have made such propaganda every time they fail, and it has not been just once. The Japanese army's attack this time was indeed a full-fledged effort. The Chinese army, on the one hand, can cope with the Japanese offensive, and on the other hand, it can advance and implement a counteroffensive. This shows that American aid has begun to take effect. The result of this battle proves that democratic countries should step up their aid to China. (3rd)

Editorial

### The Tragedy of the Aggression Front

Yesterday, Hitler gave a speech in which he admitted that "the only mistake since the start of the war was neglecting the Soviet Union's large-scale military preparations." This statement is equivalent to the "edict of self-reproach" of this invasion demon. Although he still shamelessly claimed that the war against the Soviet Union had been a great victory, between the lines, he clearly revealed a sense of frustration and self-inflicted wounds. Originally, this invasion of the Soviet Union, from any point of view, was Hitler's unprecedented major failure since he gained power. He hoped that the blitzkrieg would succeed, but in fact it has transformed into a long-term war of attrition. He妄想英美或者默許他的反共十字軍運動, 結果却差不多已促成英美蘇三國的同盟，He妄想英美或者默許他的反共十字軍運動, 結果却差不多已促成英美蘇三國的同盟，He妄想英美或者默許他的反共十字軍運動, 結果却差不多已促成英美蘇三國的同盟，He更希望自蘇聯掠得許多作戰資源、誰想反而耗去偌大兵力，賠掉大量軍實，莫說高加索的油田，依然可望而不可即，就以烏克蘭的糧食而論，也已失之太遲，因爲本年的麥收早爲蘇聯富局捷足先登，德軍想要在烏克蘭方面取給糧食，恐怕至少要等到明年夏天，關於這一層，無怪德國的經濟專家克羅第斯要說：攻蘇後德國自蘇聯取得的物資接濟，尙不及戰前依照雙方經濟協定所可獲得的數量！這眞是得不償失的大大失策。

It is truly said that misfortunes never come singly. In the West, there is a Hitler who spun a cocoon around himself, and in the East, there is an ally who messed things up. The former is still willing to admit "mistakes," while the latter not only refuses to admit mistakes, but insists on putting on a brave face and issuing some self-deceptive propaganda. For example, the recent battle in northern Hunan was clearly because they underestimated the strength and morale of the Chinese army and committed the major taboo of penetrating deep into enemy territory and cutting off their retreat route, resulting in their hasty escape. However, they insisted on calling it a "change of front." It was clear that they were surrounded by the Chinese army before realizing the difficulty and retreating, and they never even entered Changsha. However, they insisted on saying that they "automatically withdrew after completing their objective." If this incredible and untruthful propaganda is compared with the Chinese military authorities' truthful reports, which are completely and fully redeemed, anyone cannot help but smile wryly.

In his speech, Hitler actually claimed to be invincible and declared that he would never propose peace again. This is partly a facade he used to boost morale and prepare for winter warfare, and partly because, in fact, no matter how protracted the war against the Soviet Union is and how much it deviates from expectations, his war machine is still ferocious and powerful, and still a major threat to the Soviet Union. This is an undeniable fact. However, for Germany, there will be at least three points worth worrying about in the future: First, when winter arrives, snow will accumulate everywhere in the Soviet Union. Not only will mechanized units be useless, but even the air force will lose its effectiveness, because on the one hand, the climate is extremely cold, and on the other hand, a piece of white silver is no different from the entire earth being covered with a layer of natural camouflage. Bombing targets will inevitably be extremely difficult to identify; Second, the meeting of the three countries, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, has concluded satisfactorily. In the future, not only will aid to the Soviet Union be stepped up, but Britain will also have a day to select targets and launch a counterattack as soon as possible; Third, with no hope of easing the British naval blockade for a while, the European continent will feel a great shortage of food and coal this winter. Under the intensified oppression of the victors, the oppressed masses in the occupied areas will inevitably take the risk and rise up to resist. The recent assassinations in Paris, the general strike in Norway, the guerrilla warfare in Yugoslavia, and the unrest in Czechoslovakia are all signs that the Nazi regime is gradually shaking. Based on these three points, Hitler will clearly suffer endless harm this winter because of his "only mistake" and may even fall into a slump.

As for Japan, its recent launch of the battle in northern Hunan was undoubtedly hoping to follow the path of avoiding the heavy and attacking the light, and quickly achieve a relatively glorious victory, so as to relieve its internal and external difficulties. Among them, what is particularly important is to try to use this victory to increase its bargaining power with the United States and increase its threat to the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, now these expectations have become a bubble due to the "automatic withdrawal" from the front line in northern Hunan. The military blow is certainly great, but the political and diplomatic consequences seem to be even more unfavorable. It is said that it may affect the future of the Japanese cabinet. Looking back at China, on the one hand, the morale of the whole country is high, and we will see that the front lines in other war zones will also launch a counteroffensive. On the other hand, because friendly countries have long been deeply convinced of the increase in China's strength, we will see that those who gain the Dao will have more help, and international aid will inevitably be more enthusiastic than before. At a time when the US military mission and the British financial delegation are on their way to Chongqing, and the military authorities of the US, Britain, and the Philippines are holding an important meeting in Manila, the world has a clearer confidence in the future of the Far East situation.

### Liang Dequan Passes Away from Overwork While Enthusiastically Raising Bonds

Chongqing, the bond-raising campaign in Hong Kong is about to end with satisfactory results, which will be officially announced soon. The greatest characteristic of this Hong Kong bond-raising campaign is the universality of the mobilization and the depth of the publicity. People from all walks of life enthusiastically participated, which is rarely seen in previous patriotic movements. Among them, Mr. Liang Dequan, a businessman, originally served as a volunteer in the Hong Kong Zhongshan Charity Society and other important clan associations. He was particularly enthusiastic about this Hong Kong bond-raising campaign, working day and night in the fifth team of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce's bond-raising campaign, regardless of wind or rain, running around and using his eloquent tongue to encourage and inspire people. Everyone who listened generously donated. Unfortunately, due to overwork, he was unaware of his accumulated illnesses. He suddenly fell ill, but because of the blackout, he could not find a doctor for treatment and passed away. This is the first person to sacrifice since the public bond-raising campaign. Wu Hanzhen, a special commissioner of the Bond-Raising Association, wrote an article to mourn him. It is heard that the association will also commend him. (4th)

### British and American Far East Military Leaders Discuss Pacific Situation

Pak Fang Inspects Philippine Island Defenses by Air; U.S. Delegation to Go to Hong Kong and Then Chongqing

United Press, Manila, 4th – Official sources announced this morning that British Far East Commander-in-Chief Marshal Pak Fang and U.S. Far East Commander Lieutenant General MacArthur held important discussions here yesterday and today.  The two reviewed the military situation and exchanged specialized opinions on the Pacific problem.  The two were old friends and veterans of the last World War.  At that time, MacArthur was the commander of the "Rainbow" Division, while Pak Fang was an aviator.  The official announcement also stated that Major General Magruder, the head of the U.S. military delegation to China, also participated in the discussions.

Reuters, Manila, 4th – British Far East Commander-in-Chief Pak Fang today also met with U.S. Far East Commander MacArthur and Major General Magruder, leader of the U.S. military mission to Chongqing.  According to an army statement issued after the meeting, both sides had an interesting conversation, studied the military situation, exchanged specialized opinions, and reviewed various issues concerning the world and the Pacific region.

United Press, Manila, 4th – British Far East Commander-in-Chief Marshal Pak Fang today toured the important national defense areas of the Philippines by plane for three hours, after which he met with senior military officials in the Far East to discuss the Pacific problem.  Accompanying Marshal Pak Fang on the aerial inspection was Major General Clagett, commander of the U.S. Far East Army Air Force.  At the same time, four important representatives of the U.S. delegation to China will fly to Hong Kong tomorrow and then to Chongqing.  Delegation leader Major General Magruder and other representatives were hosted at a banquet today by Dr. Yang Guangxing, the Chinese Consul General, and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.  U.S. Far East Commander MacArthur will host a luncheon tomorrow in honor of Marshal Pak Fang. Senior U.S. Army and civilian officials, such as Admiral Hord, commander of the Asiatic Fleet, and Mr. Sayre, the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, will also attend the luncheon.

United Press, Tokyo, 4th – The diplomatic monthly "Gaiko Jiho," which often reflects the views of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said today, "If the United States truly upholds justice and humanity, it should immediately end the European war.  In this vast world, only the United States can undertake this task, and it is not too late now.  But it is most regrettable that the United States shows signs of abandoning this honor, because the U.S. participation in the war will expand the war to all parts of the world and will increase human suffering.  The Axis powers are working to create a 'new order' in Europe and East Asia in order to eliminate unreasonable and unnatural factors that disrupt peace. The United States should strictly adhere to neutrality and hope for the realization of the 'new order,' because the 'new order' not only does not threaten the United States, but will also benefit the United States.  The United States should recognize the fait accompli in East Asia, restore its natural commercial relations with Japan, and stop helping Japan's enemies."

### Although the Surface is Quite Peaceful, Vietnam Conceals Unease; Mr. Fonzawa and His Entourage are About to Take Office, As the First Symbol of Long-Term Occupation

Reuters, Hanoi, 4th – Although the situation here is superficially peaceful, it is actually still fraught with unease. General attention is now focused on the imminent arrival of Fonzawa. It is said that Fonzawa is bringing a large number of consular officials with him. The Japanese military mission, previously led by Cheng Tian, has now been mostly disbanded, and the remaining personnel will be incorporated under Fonzawa. People here are watching the arrival of Fonzawa with attention and hope that this will facilitate the resolution of some difficulties. Governor Decoux of Vietnam's recent remarks about the Japanese side not fully fulfilling the conditions of the economic agreement can indicate the French authorities' full understanding of the various difficulties experienced by Vietnamese import merchants. Recently, five major import merchants have cancelled contracts signed with Japanese merchants because the delivery of orders has been repeatedly delayed, and the original prices of several transactions have been increased four times. Japanese cargo ships come empty and leave full of Vietnamese goods. Japanese trading companies here are now making various efforts to concentrate business in their hands, intending to first import various goods themselves and then deliver them to local customers. Neutral observers here all regard Fonzawa's actions as the first sign of Japan's attempt at long-term occupation. The rumors of British, American, and Japanese negotiations have aroused attention and speculation here, but no detailed information is available in Vietnam, as in any other place.

### Germany Emphasizes Southern Route Offensive; Fierce Battles in Ukraine; Soviet Paratroopers Land Behind German Lines to Cut off Communications; Red Army in Crimea Launches Major Counteroffensive

Reuters, London, 4th – The Soviet Union recently announced that it had made some local progress in a strong counter-offensive in the Leningrad region, but the Ukraine remains the most critical area. The German offensive against the industrial city of Kharkov has undoubtedly made some progress. Other German forces are now advancing towards Poltava. According to Vichy sources, German forces are now attacking Kursk, 120 miles north of Kharkov. The large-scale military operation mentioned in Hitler's speech may refer to this. Soviet forces in the Odessa region are still fighting strongly, and the counter-offensive is reported to be very successful. Soviet forces have used paratroopers from the Black Sea Fleet to land behind German lines and cut off communication lines. There is still fierce fighting at the Perekop Isthmus in Crimea. All reports indicate that the German offensive has been contained. It is reported that General Timoshenko's troops in the central region have made local progress and recovered several villages and towns. The German High Command's official statement said that large-scale military operations are currently underway. German aircraft bombed important targets in Moscow and Leningrad last night, causing several large fires. The Soviet statement said that there were battles along the entire front. According to Finland's radio news, Soviet reinforcements are now arriving in Leningrad one after another. Attempts by German forces to seize ports on the Arctic Ocean have been repelled. Moscow dispatches said that a German Alpine division has been annihilated. The German losses in this battle totaled 1,500 dead and several thousand wounded. Moscow news also said that British fighter planes fighting in Soviet territory shot down five German Messerschmitt aircraft, with no losses on their own side.

International News Service, Moscow, 4th – The Soviet High Command issued a special communiqué stating that the Red Army has won new victories on the battlefield below Leningrad, with 1,500 German soldiers killed and several thousand wounded. The communiqué stated that several German units, which were trying to advance towards the city from the southwest of Leningrad, have been hit hard by the Red Army in the northwest region and have all been annihilated. The Red Army also inflicted heavy damage on German forces in the central region, with 3,000 German soldiers killed or wounded, and 32 German tanks destroyed between Vitebsk and Smolensk. It is said that traffic between Moscow and Leningrad was temporarily cut off, but has now been restored and is being heavily protected. Several German air units attempted to bomb Moscow last night, but were driven back by Soviet anti-aircraft fire and fighter planes. German aircraft did not break through the outer defense line of the Soviet capital.

United Press, Moscow, 4th – "Red Star" published a report stating that fierce fighting continued in Leningrad yesterday. The Red Army prevented attempts to penetrate the main positions of the Soviet army. "Red Star" reported that the Red Army counterattacked in several areas and German forces were forced to retreat from their positions. "Izvestia" published a report from the Baltic Fleet detailing the naval battles in the Irben Strait in the Gulf of Riga over the past few months. The Soviet Union said it defended the strait on the Moon Islands. "Izvestia" reported that the Soviet Navy landed on an island occupied by German forces at the entrance to Leningrad in the Gulf of Finland and secured important positions. It also stated that the battle in the Gulf of Riga is still ongoing. "Red Star" reported that in the Gomel area, German mechanized and motorized units repeatedly attempted to penetrate the Soviet army line. They broke through in one place, but were countered by a Soviet tank force. They lost 12 tanks. The Ministry of the Navy first reported on the activities of the Black Sea Fleet and Air Force near Crimea, stating that eight German aircraft were shot down. Moscow reported that two German units in the Murmansk area attempted to establish positions on the east bank of the Litsa River and attempted to attack Murmansk. The Red Army bombarded them with artillery, and the German forces were forced to leave their defensive positions, with 1,000 soldiers killed and several thousand wounded. Radio also stated that the German forces on the east bank of the Litsa River have been cleared. A report from the Southern Front published in "Red Star" stated that after a fierce battle, a large German force attempting to penetrate the Soviet army was stopped. The place name in the area was not specified in the report, but the Southern Front includes Crimea and Ukraine. "Red Star" reported that the Soviet counteroffensive had penetrated the Nazi defense line, surrounded German forces, and recovered several towns and villages.

Soviet September Supplement to Battle Report; Summarizing Battle Results Achieved in Various Regions

Reuters, Moscow, 4th – A Soviet supplementary communiqué announced that a Soviet unit in the Leningrad region killed 1,500 German soldiers in September. The communiqué stated that a Soviet unit under Colonel Ponomarev, operating on the southwest front, killed 9,500 German officers and soldiers, destroyed 7 enemy artillery batteries, 35 anti-tank guns, 45 machine guns, 22 grenade launchers, and 60 trucks in September, and captured a large number of war trophies, including 4 heavy artillery batteries, 52 anti-tank guns, 57 light and heavy machine guns, 12 grenade launchers, 28 flamethrowers, 180 trucks, 200 horses, and a large amount of ammunition. Also, a large detachment of Soviet infantry and aircraft on a certain front southwest (Ukraine) cooperated to destroy 25 German tanks and 80 trucks, and captured 311 automobiles and 100 motorcycles. In the air battles near Leningrad in the previous two days, five German aircraft were shot down. The supplementary communiqué also described the circumstances of 3,000 Finnish tanks near a bridge in Karelia that was blown up by guerrillas, with five being destroyed by Soviet aircraft, stating that the Finnish army abandoned hundreds of dead and wounded soldiers and many machine guns on the battlefield.

Hitler Appeals to the German People to Fight the Soviet Union at All Costs

United Press, Berlin, 4th – Yesterday, Führer Hitler declared to Germany that the Soviet army had been largely destroyed by Germany, and warned the German people that they should make new sacrifices to win the war. He also reiterated his supreme confidence and declared, "With the military equipment we are providing, we can overcome all obstacles. The military equipment we are using in this year's operations will be the equipment we use in next year's operations." Hitler said that the war against the Soviet Union, which broke out on June 22, has global significance. "The future world will regard this day as a new page in history."

German Progress Slows Down, Proving That Morale Is Declining

Reuters, London, 4th – A Reuters military commentator said that the best critique of the progress of the war can be seen in the gradually slowing rate of German advance. In the first two months, the German advance averaged ten kilometers per day, then gradually decreased to an average of one or two kilometers per day. In the past few days, there has been almost no progress. Furthermore, the Soviet positions in Leningrad seem to have stabilized. The Soviet army counterattacks as the German army advances. The Soviet side not only defends the vast front lines around the city, but also maintains smooth traffic lines to the city. In short, the war has almost reached a state of trench warfare. The German transportation lines are long and dangerous, and their reserve troops and supply bases are threatened by the closer proximity of the Soviet army. The Soviet side has gradually become accustomed to German tactics and has been able to find ways to achieve decisive results, which must have made their soldiers and commanders feel discouraged. The fighting was still fierce along the entire front yesterday, but the Soviet army won important local victories near Leningrad and Ukraine. The German army may fight to the death in order to capture Kharkov in a few days. If the German side is prepared to pay a heavy price, it may succeed, but the German side's manpower and material resources, although said to be huge, are now gradually running out and are very close to the limit of sustainability.

### Germany Implements High-Pressure Policies Against People in Occupied Countries; 14 More Czechs Executed; People Also Arrested in Poland, France, Hungary, Etc.; Czech Cabinet Members Call on the World to Pay Attention to German Atrocities

Reuters, London, 4th – According to the latest news received in London, the flames of German terror in the occupied countries have not abated. In addition to the Prague Radio announcement that 14 more Czechs have been sentenced to death by military courts in Prague and Brno, it is reported that Polish people are also being executed daily. Swiss Radio Broadcasting also reported that more people in France have been arrested. The most recent was the arrest of 62 people in a working-class district of Paris for possessing knives and leaflets. Also, a 19-year-old girl, Miss Stankov, from Hungary, was sentenced to death by a military court in Szeged, Hungary, for sabotaging a German store in Ugopotek on September 19. Another girl, Miss Gaising, was charged with the same crime and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Both girls have pleaded guilty and said that the "explosives" were provided by Miss Stankov's brother. The German side still charged the recently executed Czechs with "treason, economic sabotage, and illegal possession of weapons, etc." Of the 14 Czechs executed yesterday, 8 were shot and the remaining 6 were hanged. Another 130 Czechs were handed over to the secret police. In the past three months, the number of Poles executed and shot, as reported in a small number of German newspapers in Poland, was 150, including 12 women, the rest being men. This is based on information collected from German newspapers. The number of those directly killed by the secret police without any legal justification, and those who died from torture in concentration camps, is even more unknown. It is reported that in a certain famous concentration camp built by the German side, at least 40 people die every day.

Reuters, London, 4th – The Czech cabinet broadcast a message to the Czech people yesterday afternoon, stating that the Czech government faithfully conveys the feelings of the people and declares that all true Czechs will swear on the graves of the brutally murdered soldiers, workers, technicians, farmers, and intellectuals to avenge them and to persist in the struggle against German oppression until final victory is achieved. The Czech government asks the civilized world to pay attention to the fact that Hitler's executioners have put to death some Czechs who were detained in German prisons and concentration camps many months ago and could not participate in recent movements. The German massacre of innocent Czechs held as hostages is a heinous crime. Clean people all over the world will take it as their sacred duty to never forget this German spiritual shame. The Czech government, because of the martyrdom and resistance of its people, believes that it not only has the responsibility but also the right to ask the world to remember that without Czech freedom, there is no freedom in Europe, and that the establishment of a new order of peace must be based on law and strict fairness towards Germany. The article did not instruct Czechs abroad not to participate in all public gatherings that have no direct connection with their work, in order to express their grief.

Haitong News Agency, Beijing, 4th – The German Commander-in-Chief stationed in Belgium and Northern France, in view of the fact that Belgian and French youths are trying to leave the country illegally to join the enemy, has taken appropriate precautionary measures. According to the recently promulgated order, anyone who privately joins the enemy army fighting against Germany will be sentenced to death. Those with special circumstances will be sentenced to imprisonment. The same applies to those who help others commit this crime. The German Commander-in-Chief pointed out that these youths are all seduced by foreign spies and do not understand the nature of their actions. However, since Germany has already released the surrendered troops and prisoners of war from Belgium, it also trusts the loyalty of the Belgian people, so it cannot tolerate this movement of Belgian youths.

Germany Claims that Mr. Ilyess Committed Espionage

Haitong News Agency, Prague, 4th – Witness Richter testified in the People's Court yesterday that Prime Minister Ilyess was a secret leader of some kind similar to May Asia. He knew quite well about the secret military organizations established by General Engel and General Neumann in the Protectorate. General Engel was in charge of arranging for Czechs to cross the border. Neumann was responsible for assassinating Czechs who compromised with Germany. The families of those who joined the Benes government and fled overseas were also supported by some illegal organization. Mr. Ilyess was even related to a certain espionage agency, whose leader was the Prime Minister's Director of Intelligence, Mr. Allen. Richter testified under detailed questioning that Yap originally approved of cooperating with Germany, but was induced by Mr. Ilyess to join his organization.

Germany Also Arrests Many People in Norway

International News Service, Stockholm, 4th – It is reported that many more people have been arrested in Norway, and the upper classes have also been suppressed.

These workers were arrested en masse during the recent repeated strikes.

Danish Anti-Nazi Sabotage Occurs

### American Representative Ordered to Discuss Religious Freedom with the Soviet Union; Advocate for Drawing Closer to the Vatican to Leverage Religious Influence Against the Axis Powers

Reuters, Washington, 4th—President Roosevelt disclosed while hosting news reporters yesterday that he had instructed American representative Harriman to raise the issue of religious freedom within the Soviet Union. The President also stated that this matter had been previously mentioned to the Soviet government, implying that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt had handled the matter. The President further stated that he had not yet received Harriman's report and could not say whether this decision would be successful. As for the question of religious freedom being raised before the Pope, the President was unwilling to comment before his personal envoy to the Vatican, Taylor, returned to the United States.

Associated Press, Washington, 4th—A well-informed individual close to President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the diplomatic situation seemed to be leaning towards uniting Catholics worldwide to resist the Nazis. This person said that President Roosevelt greatly hoped that the Vatican and Moscow could reach a rapprochement, allowing their diplomatic representatives to exchange opinions and create a broad force to resist the Axis. However, neither the White House nor the State Department confirmed this news, although concrete evidence exists to support this interpretation. This is the joint statement released by the White House yesterday, which, in light of the Polish ambassador's report, expressed the hope that steps could be taken to achieve complete religious freedom. Furthermore, some Catholics have hinted that if President Roosevelt could persuade Stalin to create a satisfactory environment for religion in communist countries, the Vatican would resolve to oppose the Axis. This individual close to President Roosevelt, well-versed in the religious issue within the Soviet Union and its impact on global diplomacy, told an Associated Press reporter that the United States is planning to make the Soviet Union an ally of the United States, the United Kingdom, and various South American republics, with the Catholic issue being a key condition of this plan. It is heard that the United States has made considerable progress in this diplomatic strategy, but the individual did not guarantee the success of this diplomatic plan. Experts familiar with the debate over religious freedom within the Soviet Union believe that US envoy to the Vatican, Taylor, must have mentioned the possibility of a rapprochement between the Vatican and the Soviet Union during his negotiations with the Vatican. President Roosevelt's comments yesterday regarding religious freedom in the Soviet Union have attracted considerable attention. Observers believe that the White House has made a firm decision on this issue, and although current diplomatic actions do not yet show signs of encircling Germany with religion, it is generally expected that this issue will develop further in the future.

Associated Press, London, 4th—Reliable sources announced today that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Cripps recently raised the issue of Soviet tolerance of religion during talks with Soviet leaders. It is understood that he pointed out the benefits the British government believes the Soviet Union could gain by ceasing anti-God propaganda. These well-informed sources strongly asserted that greater Soviet tolerance of religion would greatly enhance the standing of the Soviet Union and the Allied nations in the United States and other important Catholic countries such as Spain and South American nations.

### Amendment to American Neutrality Act to be Decided Next Week; Armed Merchant Ships Being Prepared

Reuters, Washington, 4th—President Roosevelt told the press yesterday that the government intends to find a way to amend the Neutrality Act. A final decision cannot be made until the Senate leaders hold a bipartisan meeting next Tuesday. Regarding the issue of arming American merchant ships, which is prohibited by the Neutrality Act, he believes that the law is very clear on this point. He cannot force Congress to enact a practical policy, nor does he intend to modify the current boundaries of the war zone. However, he feels that the meeting on Tuesday should resolve the Neutrality Act issue.

Associated Press, New York, 4th—Rear Admiral Blandy, Chairman of the Naval Ordnance Bureau, told a graduating class of US Naval Reserve officers last night that the United States is preparing to arm its merchant fleet. He urged the nation to increase production to fulfill America's promise, as America has described itself as the "arsenal of democracy," and stated, "Every moment of idleness is tantamount to seeking our own death." He said, "Even if Germany enslaves all the nations of Europe, Hitler will not be satisfied and cease his aggression. He himself has repeatedly stated that 'democracy and totalitarianism cannot coexist in the same world.'"

### British-German Prisoner Exchange Postponed

Reuters, London, 4th—The War Office announced that the exchange of British and German wounded and sick prisoners of war, originally scheduled for today, has been postponed. Reuters learned from responsible sources that this postponement is expected to be temporary. The War Office stated that some of the German prisoners of war to be repatriated were originally scheduled to board two hospital ships tonight (Friday) and, according to arrangements agreed upon with the German government, sail across the English Channel to a port in France, and from there, embark wounded and sick British soldiers. However, due to a message received from Berlin, it was deemed necessary to postpone the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war originally scheduled to begin on Saturday. The British government is currently communicating with the German government and hopes to issue a statement within 24 hours. In the meantime, the German prisoners remain on board the ships. When the War Office issued the announcement, the German prisoners had all boarded the ships, and both sides had agreed to a truce from one hour before sunrise to one hour after sunset to facilitate the transport of the prisoners. The first batch of German prisoners boarded the hospital ships last night at a port with dimmed lights. The two hospital ships, the "Dinaht" and the "St. Julien," formerly used for channel crossings, are now painted white with yellow funnels and masts. The sides of the ships are painted with blue and red crosses, and red cross flags are flown from the mastheads and bows and sterns. Last night, the lights on both ships were brightly lit, and nurses in Red Cross uniforms were seen attending to the German prisoners boarding the ships. Ninety-seven wounded German prisoners boarded one of the ships, including a German army officer, possibly captured in Libya. The rest wore German navy and air force uniforms, with many others in civilian clothes, mostly merchant seamen, and some submarine personnel. Most carried luggage, either suitcases or cloth bags. The last to board were wounded soldiers carried on stretchers, with stretcher-bearers wearing Red Cross armbands. Some of these wounded soldiers had lost the use of both legs, some had lost their right leg, and others walked slowly with crutches. Only two were still defiant; they were both aviators and shouted "Heil Hitler!" as they disembarked. It is reported that the "St. Julien" did not carry German soldiers and would cross the channel empty. Just as the two ships were preparing to set sail, an order was received to postpone the departure. The lights were immediately extinguished, and armed guards were stationed on board for protection.

### Another American Oil Tanker Sunk in the South Atlantic; 34 Crew Members Rescued, 4 Missing; Cuban Navy Captures Submarine Supply Ship

Havas, New York, 3rd—The American oil tanker "White Shell," previously transferred from Mobil Oil to the United Kingdom, but still manned by American sailors due to a shortage of British seamen, was recently sailing towards Cape Town, South Africa, to refuel British ships returning home from the Far East when it was sunk by the enemy within the American neutrality zone 450 miles off the coast of Brazil. Of the 41 crew members, only 18 were rescued.

Associated Press, Rio de Janeiro, 4th—Four crew members of the Panamanian oil tanker "White Shell," which was torpedoed in the American neutrality zone 450 miles off the coast of Brazil, are still missing today. Thirty-four have been rescued.

Associated Press, New York, 4th—Mobil Oil of New Jersey stated yesterday that the Panamanian oil tanker "Hue Shell," which was attacked by a torpedo on September 27th, was formerly owned by the company but was transferred to the United Kingdom six months ago. The company stated that the ship usually carried 37 sailors, all of whom were American citizens, with one, Edward Veague, from Honolulu. The company stated that the ship may have carried other passengers in addition to the sailors.

Reuters, Havana, 4th—The Cuban Navy captured a large, steel-hulled ship with no name and no nationality off Cape Hurnia. The matter is quite mysterious, and the general impression is that this ship is a submarine supply ship, blown to Cape Hurnia by the hurricanes of the past two weeks.

### 紗花　空頭已了結一至　紗市場檯風漸轉變　本來投機看風頭而今風頭又講過

Cotton Yarn: Short Selling Has Largely Concluded; The Cotton Yarn Market's Typhoon is Gradually Shifting; Originally, Speculation Looked to the Wind, But Now the Wind Has Passed

Recently, the cotton yarn market has suddenly become a center of speculation. Although the Nanyang Exchange's activity was cited as a pretext, when that group initially launched their actions, short sellers were dumping shares daily, creating immense pressure. Having endured for a long time, and recognizing that the environment did not permit further action, they painfully covered their positions, resulting in a surge of seventy to eighty yuan in a single day yesterday. Most short positions have been closed, and the situation has drastically changed. There is no longer a so-called short squeeze, and therefore no longer a prevailing wind. In all speculative markets, once the wind has passed, the situation can change dramatically. Furthermore, the long positions have already made significant profits and are frequently releasing their holdings in large quantities. Therefore, some say that the long and short positions are like playing eight rounds of mahjong; the winner has already been decided. Now it is time to switch positions and start a new hand. Let's see which side falters. As for the Hong Kong market's needs, seeing that the cotton yarn market is too high, they have already given up. The telegram from Nanyang regarding the price limit of 1,900 yuan for 20-count Shuangma yarn has not yet been retransmitted. Perhaps because they have already purchased a large amount, they are taking a temporary break. As a result, those who made money have lost their basis, and they are letting go of Shuangma factory orders. The news from Xiangbei's victory and falling yarn prices in Sichuan has further discouraged the long positions. The high price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,944 yuan, the low price was 1,915 yuan, and the closing price was 1,932 yuan. The market is closed this afternoon as usual for the weekend, and there will be a holiday on Monday for the Mid-Autumn Festival. Currently, the cotton yarn market has surged by 132 yuan this week, and a reaction is not to be ignored. 180 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today.

Shuangma opened in the morning, and short sellers posted two yuan due to yesterday afternoon's decline. Later, the long positions released, and it was leveled off. Therefore, the momentum was relatively stable. The opening price was 1,915 yuan. As soon as this price was set, everyone on the floor started selling, saying to open low and buy high. In an instant, it rose to 1,941 yuan. Then, as the exchange opened slightly better, confidence was restored, and buying pressure remained strong. However, large accounts released massive quantities, and it fell back to 1,925 yuan. However, as soon as the price loosened, buyers swarmed in and it rose again to 1,944 yuan. But the supply on the floor remained strong, and it loosened again to 1,932 yuan at the close. The trading volume in the half-day was 15,020 bales. Except for 20 bales purchased by the Hong Kong market, the rest were all transactions within the industry.

Today's Shuangma futures market followed the usual weekend practice of operating for only half a day, but the market sentiment was surprisingly high, advancing towards a new peak. The recent sharp rise in factory orders has greatly alarmed the short sellers. Their covering, coupled with the manipulation of large accounts, has led to the strong performance of spot goods. The futures market sentiment has also become firm, and everyone is scrambling to buy, making the market increasingly bullish. The situation seems to be reaching its climax. When it initially opened this morning, the October contract was at 1,819.00, up 11 yuan. The November contract was at 1,825.00, also up 7 yuan. The December contract was at 1,865.00, up 5 yuan. In the middle of the day, as the exchange was firm but then weakened, some long positions were released, and the market price declined temporarily. The October contract fell to 1,814.00, the November contract fell to 1,823.00, and the December contract fell slightly to 1,852.00. Afterwards, as spot goods were seen to be rising again, buyers resumed their upward push, and trading became active. The market immediately recovered by more than ten yuan. The volatility was unprecedented. The upward trend is entirely tied to the high prices of factory orders and spot goods. Therefore, those involved should make changes in line with spot goods and pay attention to the coming backdraft. The full-day fluctuation resulted in an increase of 20 yuan for the near-term contract, 23 yuan for the November contract, and 19 yuan for the December contract. Monday is a holiday in lieu of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the market will be closed for one day. The opening, closing, and lowest prices are listed on the left.

### 廠商不肯失去　購棉機會

Manufacturers Are Unwilling to Miss the Opportunity to Purchase Cotton

Still Purchasing Within the Possible Range

Although the spot cotton situation is firm, it is still characterized by high prices for coarse cotton and weak prices for fine cotton. This is because those hoarding cotton are unwilling to release their holdings, thinking only of a positive outlook. Therefore, the market sentiment remains firm. Shipments from Hong Kong have not stopped, and Indian cotton occasionally arrives in Shanghai. As for the factories, they generally have three months' worth of inventory. Regarding the application for foreign exchange, there may be a solution for industrial products. It is difficult to predict the future changes.

American cotton, Peng Jia Po, 100 bales, declared at 2635.0

Brazilian, 700 bales, also 735.0

Also, 200 bales, domestic and foreign, declared at 80.0

(November Silver)

Du Li La, 100 bales, dealer's purchase price 500.0

Changyinsha packing, 100 bales, also 450.0

Rangoon, 100 bales, also 470.0

Also, 100 bales, also 465.0

Another report: The Shanghai foreign cotton market is active, and sentiment is enthusiastic. Although some factories are quite interested in purchasing spot cotton, they are hesitant to directly order foreign cotton. At the same time, most of the industry is still unable to purchase due to the lack of a proper solution for foreign exchange settlement. However, considering that the sales price of orders is quite low, and that significant profits will be made upon arrival in Shanghai, it is a rare and excellent opportunity. Therefore, in recent days, those factories that can obtain US dollars as much as possible within the possible range have been enthusiastically ordering foreign cotton that will arrive in Shanghai soon.

The New York cotton market initially fell due to the Southern group selling and floating long positions. However, it later rebounded slightly due to some industry buying and short covering. Yesterday's closing price was down two to three pounds compared to the previous day.

The Indian cotton market initially rose due to speculators buying and Calcutta textile industry buying. However, it later fell again due to spot merchants selling and cotton merchants short selling. As a result, yesterday's closing prices all fell by five to six rupees.

### 糧食　洋米新到返三萬包　米價先小後大

Grains: 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Newly Arrived; Rice Prices Initially Small, Then Large

Yesterday's foreign rice prices started low and ended high, and the market presented a fluctuating situation again. However, more than two rice boats arrived, and the 58,000 bags of government-sold rice from public warehouses have been released in batches. It is also rumored that the next batch can be agreed upon soon and released at a fair price. Therefore, the market opened in the morning with a unanimous downward trend, and many floating accounts were eager to close their positions. The opening prices of all types of rice saw a decline. Xiaojiao spot rice once fell to 117 yuan, and even the Yinhua Company's Xiaojiao fell from 145.78 yuan to 145 yuan. The spot price was 140 yuan, down one to two yuan from the previous day. Then, customer囤 (a unit of rice measurement) took advantage of the low prices to absorb, and because the market will be closed today and tomorrow, the local customers are preparing to stock up earlier. The market then rose unanimously in the midst of active buying interest. Xiaojiao reached 119 yuan again, and the market became even tighter in the afternoon. The transaction volume was 30,000 bags and 400 tons. The rice industry will be closed today and tomorrow due to the Mid-Autumn Festival.

A large amount of foreign rice arrived at the port. The SS. Daylite, managed by the British company Gordon Foreign Firm, directly transported a large batch of foreign rice from Myanmar, totaling approximately 28,000 bags, which arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. In addition, the Jardine Matheson's Fusheng ship arrived in Shanghai the night before, transporting 470 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (祖)

Although the supply of newly harvested early and late japonica rice is still not large, the market supply is still abundant. Therefore, most goods owners are willing to sell at lower prices to meet their financial needs for the festival. Occasionally, local native shops also ease up on their purchases due to the approaching festival, causing the market to stagnate. For example, the early Nan Gang rice was sold yesterday at 152-153 yuan, a drop of three to four yuan from the previous day. The Kunshan new japonica rice also opened at only 151 yuan, eventually falling to 148 yuan, a drop of two to three yuan. As for the new Dujian, it was restrained at the critical moment, dropping by one to two yuan, opening at 131 yuan, 130 yuan, and 129 yuan.

The glutinous rice trade has always been small, and it is even rarer during this festival season. The Hong Kong white glutinous rice continued to open high at 143.5 yuan, then fell to 138 yuan. The glutinous lu (green beans) was at 134 yuan.

### 節前提前添辦　麪粉需銷更濃

Stronger demand for flour as people stock up early for the festival

Yesterday, the actual sales of foreign flour were strong, and the retailers were greedy. Moreover, as local customers stocked up early before the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, the market was even more lively. However, the goods owners were settling foreign exchange after setting rates, and the goods en route and in stock were decreasing, which was enough to seize the opportunity to reverse the trend. As a result, the bullish side held on tightly, and local customers and retailers needed it even more. The market price rose gradually. As a result, it rose by 5 jiao (a unit of currency) compared to the previous market. Jinlong Xizhan closed at 33.78 yuan in the morning and rose to 34.1 yuan in the afternoon. Dongzhan closed at 34.25 yuan in the morning and rose to 34.7 jiao in the afternoon. Baotai closed at 35.9 yuan in the morning and 36.12 yuan in the afternoon.

Large quantities of flour are being transported north. The Taikoo Company's Liangzhou ship will sail directly to Tianjin today, transporting 14,000 bags of flour from this city. Jardine Matheson's Fusheng ship will also depart for Tianjin today, also carrying over 10,000 bags of flour to Tianjin. This flour is all Australian and Canadian foreign flour that is being transshipped to Tianjin.

### 油市　油價堅昂　門前忽見手溜彈

Oil Market: Oil Prices Firm and High; Suddenly Hand Grenades Appear in Front of the Gate

It was reported in this newspaper the other day that 2,910 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were distributed yesterday, and large quantities were still being negotiated. However, the edible oil market situation is still difficult to lower under the control of various groups. The market hovers, not much higher or lower than before. The Tongshi market sells more than 100 barrels each of Qingdao raw oil and soybean oil, 20 barrels of Jiangbei raw oil, 500 tins each of Yanting raw oil and soybean oil, 50 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, nearly 10,000 dan of Dayou Factory's refined oil futures, and about 1,000 barrels of vegetable oil from various factories (prices detailed in the market price section). It was also learned that last night, someone suddenly threw two hand grenades at the entrance of the Cereals Association, and the purpose is unknown.

Yesterday, 470 pieces of imported soybean oil and 180 pieces of raw oil arrived, all from Qingdao.

### 金融　節前金市堅穩

Finance: Gold Market Firm and Stable Before the Festival

Yesterday, the dark market for cooked gold continued to trend stable and firm. The October futures of Chaozhou silk floss was short-covered by more than 400 taels, rising from 7,605 yuan to 7,620 yuan, an increase of 12 yuan. The total transaction volume was more than 1,000 taels. The increase in cash was still stronger, which was caused by the successive absorption by the Hong Kong help money exchange industry and the jewelry industry, resulting in a gradual increase from 9,400 yuan in the morning to 9,450 yuan at noon, a further increase of 50 yuan. The transaction volume was about 400 taels. Ornament gold was also raised by 10 yuan to 970 yuan. Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival and also Sunday, and both the gold and foreign exchange markets will be closed for a holiday tomorrow.

The rise in gold futures is more tortuous

The October futures opened at 9:15 AM at 7,605 yuan, a high opening of 5 yuan, which was first entered by Tianyuan. Xiangxing Yongli entered to cover short positions, and the price gradually rose by 15 yuan. Ren Chengyong entered, raising it to 7,620 yuan. Dacheng Yong and Hengji released one after another, and it declined to 7,605 yuan at noon. At noon, Xiangxing Yong entered again, raising it to 7,612 yuan, a further increase of 12 yuan. The high and low in the first half of the day was 15 yuan.

Cash Rose by 50 Yuan

The spot market was quite flat in the early morning. The money exchange industry first entered Chengji with 40 taels at 9,400 yuan, and continued to do 40 taels, which had risen to 9,420 yuan. Shunyuan also entered, and Hengji and Chengji each did 10 taels. Xianghe entered Shili and 10 taels, rising to 9,430 yuan.

### 黑滙市况略鬆

The Black Market for Foreign Exchange Loosened Slightly

Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation was flat for both the Central Bank and HSBC's listed prices, as well as the small exchange counters' British and American prices. The black market for British and American exchange rates continued to loosen slightly in stability. The US exchange rate was 4.625 yuan, and some import companies for non-essential goods had managed to obtain it. The telegraphic transfer rate was 4.5 yuan, and there were still sellers. The situation returned to calm. At noon closing, the British exchange rate was still 2 shillings and 8 1/8 d, the US dollar continued to increase by 0.0625, and there was no market on Saturday afternoon.

### 疋頭　棉布氣燄頓高　高峯迭見囤戶手貨不放　四天來漲四五元之巨

Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth's Arrogance Suddenly Increases; Repeated Peaks Seen; Hoarders Do Not Release Goods; A Huge Increase of Four to Five Yuan in Four Days

Factory Cloth

Yesterday's market situation continued to be firm, and cloth prices repeatedly reached peaks. Wholesale sales in the stores on this street have become sluggish, while customer business is still smooth. However, the hoarders' arrogance is rampant, and they are determined not to release the quantities they have purchased. The prices of all types of cloth have increased by another 5 jiao to 1 yuan. Examining the cloth prices at the end of last month, fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse twill have increased by 4 to 5 yuan in the past four days; heavyweight coarse cloth has increased by 4 yuan; and lightweight coarse cloth has increased by 2 to 3 yuan. Calculated on the basis of 40 pieces, each piece of cloth has to increase by a huge amount of 80 to 200 yuan. Yesterday, the Cantonese, Hong Kong, and Nanyang merchants handled more than 300 pieces of coarse cloth, twill, and bleached cloth, and more than 400 pieces were transacted on this street. Today, 710 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong.

East Cloth

The futures prices of each month's contract for Longtou (Dragon Head) brand cloth on the exchange increased again by 2 to 4 jiao per piece yesterday. This is because actual sales of spot goods are not thin, and the strong purchasing interest of both internal and external hoarders continues, pulling prices higher and higher. The price of miscellaneous brand fine cloth increased by about 5 jiao per piece. The closing price of Longtou new factory orders was 6 yuan and 4.8 jiao, and the new orders for Sijunzi (Four Gentlemen) serge were 2.36 yuan, all new high prices and the market sentiment was very strong.

### 呢絨　馬褲呢駝斯錦　已見回小

Woolens: Cavalry Twill and Tosca Serge Have Seen a Slight Decline

Cavalry twill and Tosca serge have recently been trending downwards. Goods from Yinfeng, Xinxin, Zhanghua, and Yihua have all reported declines. Looking back to ten days ago, the average price drop was roughly 10 yuan per yard, which can be described as a rapid rise and sharp fall. Yesterday, the prices of Tosca serge from various factories had been reduced by 73 to 74 yuan in most cases, and cavalry twill was at 63 to 64 yuan, down to 67 to 68 yuan. The main reason for the sudden decline is that the sharp rise was too great, and buyers and users had accumulated a large quantity, resulting in an abundance of hoarded goods. With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, actual sales of woolens have been slow, and there has been little demand for these coat fabrics. Moreover, industry insiders, recognizing that prices had reached their peak, were generally unwilling to keep large quantities in stock, preferring to sell and replenish as needed. Major and minor factories continue to produce continuously. Under the current high cost of living, it is doubtful whether a 300-yuan coat can still sell as well as before. Demand has decreased, transactions have declined, and internal and external parties are vying to get rid of their stock, resulting in a widespread price decline.

### 南北貨　蘭竹枝回升

North-South Goods: Orchid Bamboo Shoots Rebound

The price of orchid bamboo shoots had initially dropped by twenty to thirty yuan because of higher than normal quantities arriving, and retailers were uninterested, but the price for it’s cultivation has not dropped as well, so this has made a topsy-turvy situation. Now the stock is active again and the stomach is gradually becoming active, so the price is now back up, and the price is 30 yuan higher than the lower price.

### 同安圓產區登新

Tongan Longan Production Area Reports New Harvest

The Tongan longan production area has already started its harvest, and land prices are higher than last year. Because there are currently few goods coming from Quanzhou and Xinghua, each company is trying to do business there. It is said that the total volume is three to four hundred担 (dan, a unit of weight), and the declared cost is higher than the current market price. It is said that they will soon be shipped to Shanghai.

In addition, 525 bags of chestnuts and 356 bags of walnuts were all transported from Tianjin the day before yesterday.

### 統計方法譯本出版　李黃孝貞陸宗蔚合譯

Translation of "Statistical Methods" Published, Co-translated by Li Huang Xiaozhen and Lu Zongwei

Statistical Methods, authored by the renowned American statistics professor Mills, is the most suitable introductory textbook for students studying statistics. It has been published for more than ten years, and its reputation has not waned. Many universities in China also use it. The book focuses on the study of economic and commercial statistical methods, and its advantages are twofold: (1) The theory is precise and avoids superficiality and confusion, and it pays attention to the practical examples set, which can help to draw inferences about other cases.

### 今冬燃料確不缺乏　煤荒憂慮可消除　鴻基公司存煤足敷需用　但向海外續訂含冒險性　三個月所需煤斤價須美金一百萬元

No Fuel Shortage Expected This Winter; Concerns About a Coal Shortage Can Be Eliminated; Hongkong Company Has Enough Coal in Stock to Meet Needs; However, Continuing to Order from Overseas Involves Risk; The Price of Coal Needed for Three Months Requires US$1 Million

Dalu Bao reports that Mr. Li Fu, Assistant Manager of Hongkong Coal Company, stated to reporters yesterday (the 3rd) that his remarks could dispel the general concern that Shanghai would face a coal shortage this winter. According to Mr. Li, there is currently no shortage of fuel in the city, and Hongkong Company has enough coal in stock to meet needs for some time. However, bituminous coal is not very abundant, and it would be difficult to cope with a sudden emergency.

Overseas Orders Involve Considerable Risk

Due to the tense situation in the Far East, no coal companies in Shanghai are willing to risk ordering large quantities of coal from overseas. Ordering enough coal to supply the city for three months would require US$1 million. Given the current situation, it is not advisable to take this risk. When asked if the coal situation in Shanghai would become critical in winter, Mr. Li replied that he did not think so, but believed that the severity that would determine the future of Shanghai's fuel consumption depended on only two factors.

Two Important Points for the Future of Fuel

Namely, (1) foreign exchange controls, and (2) the possibility of an outbreak of war in the Pacific. Regarding the first point, until October, the Equalization Fund still allowed Hongkong Company to purchase US dollars at the official exchange rate, which is absolutely necessary for the operation of Hongkong Company, etc., because water freight, coal prices, and wages must all be paid in gold yuan. Within this month, Hongkong Company has not yet received the foreign exchange supply from the Equalization Fund. Mr. Li was certainly unable to determine whether Hongkong Company's foreign exchange application had been rejected this month. However, it is quite obvious that Hongkong Company cannot continue to operate if it is not allowed to buy and sell US dollars. (According to reports, the Equalization Fund has announced that it will approve the settlement of coal purchases this month). Secondly, the situation in the Far East must also be considered. No one knows whether the peace in the Pacific will be broken, and war is possible at any time. If that happens, the coal situation in the city will definitely deteriorate, and it cannot be recognized.

The Coal Storage Plan Belongs to Someone Else

When asked why Hongkong Company did not store more coal in Shanghai to meet future emergency needs, Mr. Li did not directly answer this question, but said, "Currently, only the Japanese store coal in the city. The information you are inquiring about may be supplied by the Japanese."

### News Summary and People's Organizations Send Telegrams to Chairman Chiang to Celebrate Victory, Build Unprecedented Achievements, and Establish Remarkable Battle Results, Expressing Congratulations and Respect

All members of the Shanghai news industry and various people's organizations were greatly encouraged by the great victory in Northern Hunan and yesterday sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang, Commander Xue, and the soldiers on the front lines to congratulate them and express their respect. (1) The telegram from the news industry to Chairman Chiang reads: "To Chairman Chiang in Chongqing, and forwarded to Commander Xue and all soldiers on the front lines: The Battle of Northern Hunan has established unprecedented achievements, created remarkable battle results, and laid a solid foundation for victory. The good news has spread, and we are overjoyed. We respectfully send this telegram to congratulate you and express our respect. The entire Shanghai news industry bows in support." (2) The telegram from various people's organizations to Chairman Chiang reads: "To Chairman Chiang in Chongqing: The Battle of Changsha relied on your wise decisions to demonstrate our military might. The encirclement was successfully completed, resulting in unprecedented achievements, initiating the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction, and serving as a prelude to future victories. We respectfully send this telegram to pay our respects, humbly requesting your perusal." (3) The telegram from various people's organizations to Commander Xue reads: "To Commander Xue in Changsha: Your strategic planning has once again achieved world-class accomplishments. Your steadfast defense and encirclement have demonstrated your strategic brilliance. Dongting Lake is calm, and Yuelu Mountain is more beautiful. Your magnificent plans are worthy of our heartfelt praise. (Remainder omitted)"

### New Procedures for Entering Hong Kong: Cash Deposit of HK$100 Now Required; Previous System of Requiring Seven Types of Guarantors Has Been Abolished

The Hong Kong Immigration Department recently officially announced the cancellation of the strict procedures for those who have not yet arrived in Hong Kong but wish to obtain a visa, which previously required a guarantor designated by the department to personally sign a guarantee at the department before a visa could be issued. Since the implementation of the system requiring seven types of guarantors, applicants have found it quite difficult. To improve this, the department has promulgated a new method of using a security deposit, canceling the previous method of guaranteeing entry with seven types of guarantors. In the future, for those who have not yet arrived in Hong Kong but wish to obtain a six-month or two-year entry permit, if their relatives or friends in Hong Kong apply for the permit on their behalf, they only need to pay a security deposit of HK$100 per permit (the same amount is required for both six-month and two-year permits), then fill out an application form and apply for an entry permit. Once the applicant arrives in Hong Kong, they can bring the receipt to the department to retrieve the HK$100 security deposit. This restriction does not apply to those who are already in Hong Kong. This restriction also applies to those who have already obtained a two-year or six-month permit and have left Hong Kong.

Guarantor System: Cumbersome Procedures

Furthermore, according to the previous regulations, if one of the seven types of qualified persons wished to guarantee the entry of their relatives or friends, they had to personally go to the department to explain the reason for guaranteeing their relative or friend's entry, as well as their own occupation in Hong Kong, and all their savings, property deeds, and house deeds had to be submitted to the department for verification. The seven types of guarantors specified were: (1) Justices of the Peace in Hong Kong; (2) Barristers or Solicitors practicing in Hong Kong; (3) Chinese government agencies with offices in Hong Kong; (4) Major banks or shipping companies in Hong Kong; (5) Those who hold land deeds in Hong Kong proving that the land is wholly owned by them; (6) Managers of Western Chambers of Commerce or Chinese General Chambers of Commerce, or proprietors or office staff of member companies; (7) Members of stock trading associations or brokerage trading associations, all of whom had the authority to sign guarantees for others. However, most of the above-mentioned people are very busy with work and therefore cannot personally go to the department, making it extremely difficult for those who wish to enter Hong Kong. Although the above-mentioned guarantor system has been abolished, the department still seriously examines the guarantors who guarantee the living expenses of entry permit applicants in Hong Kong.

### Spend the Mid-Autumn Festival Peacefully, Do Not Forget to Donate to Disaster Relief

Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar. All industries in the city, including the silver and money industry, rice and coal industry markets, the authorities of the two concessions, and various factories, are taking a day off. Various industrial and commercial sectors are handling account settlements as usual, which is very busy. Because the supply of financial resources is sufficient, all industries can spend the festival peacefully. Residents throughout the city, as various places across the country are launching fundraising efforts for winter clothing and disaster relief, also expressed their support, donating a portion of the festival expenses to winter clothing donations and disaster relief to show their patriotism and unwillingness to lag behind others. All donations are delivered directly to charitable organizations by the donors.

### Troubles of Taikoo Ships: Two Ships Catch Fire, One Runs Aground

Recently, the ships of the Taikoo Company have been experiencing many troubles. The Yuezhou wheel caught fire in the bow cabin while unloading cargo after returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 17th of last month. It is currently being handled by spreading water to extinguish the fire. It was also learned that the Anshun wheel of the same company suddenly suffered a fire disaster while unloading cargo in Xiamen the day before yesterday after sailing south from Shanghai at the end of last month. Furthermore, the Beihai wheel, which came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, reportedly ran aground on the Tongsha ocean surface outside the Wusongkou due to straying off course. The shipowner managed to drag it out, and it entered the port at around 10:00 AM yesterday morning and is currently berthed at Zhanghuabangpu awaiting orders.

### Central Bank: Newly Minted Copper Coins

The Central Bank has newly minted a type of copper subsidiary coin. The color and quality of the copper are both excellent. It has already been circulated in the inland areas but will not be transported to Shanghai for the time being. The shortage of subsidiary coins in this city has gradually been resolved after a large number of them were transported here by various banks. The public bus fare tokens have been retrieved.

### U.S. Warships Hold Drills at Wusongkou

It is reported that three U.S. Yangtze River Fleet gunboats, the Luzon, Oahu, and Wake, suddenly held exercises in the Yangtze River Delta area outside Wusongkou from the 30th of last month to the 3rd of this month. The commander of the fleet, Rear Admiral Glassford, personally commanded the exercise on board the flagship Luzon, departing from Shanghai on Monday (the 30th of last month). The exercise lasted four days and nights, and the Luzon returned to Shanghai yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM. The Oahu also entered the port and is berthed at the British Navy buoy in Pukou, while the Wake sailed west up the Yangtze River to Hankou. The captain of the Wake, which was originally berthed in Shanghai, is Lieutenant Commander Lilley, with a crew of about 60. It sailed from Shanghai to Hankou in July, and the Oahu, which was originally berthed in Hankou, then came to Shanghai. The captain of the Luzon is Brook, and the number of crew members is about the same as the Wake, including Rear Admiral Glassford's staff. This three-ship exercise demonstrates the U.S. Navy's determination not to abandon the defense of the central China coast and the Yangtze River basin during this period of urgent Far Eastern situation. It is also reported that one U.S. Yangtze River Fleet gunboat, the Tutuila, is moored on the Chongqing River and was recently bombed by Japanese aircraft. The captain of the ship is Bowers.

### Thai Ship Released for Export Yesterday

The Thai merchant ship Suriyothai Nawa, which was detained by the Jianghai Customs and anchored off the Longmao Wharf in Pudong, has reportedly reached a resolution with the Japanese side through the managing company, according to shipping industry sources. The Japanese Kempeitai authorities finally agreed that the ship would be allowed to export if the cargo was unloaded. Accordingly, after the cargo was unloaded at 10:00 AM yesterday, the ship weighed anchor and sailed south.

### Dates for Releasing Public Warehouse Rice

The more than 58,000 bags of public warehouse Xiaowen rice will be sold cheaply by rice shops in the two concessions starting at 9:00 AM on the 11th of this month. According to a report from the Rice Shop Industry Association yesterday, approximately 400 shops have registered and claimed public warehouse rice, totaling 13,000 to 14,000 bags. Today is for member rice shops in the Hongkou District, and tomorrow is for member rice shops in the West Shanghai District. The association hopes that all member shops will enthusiastically purchase rice within the specified dates so that a large amount of public warehouse rice can be sold widely. The association has stipulated the payment and delivery procedures for those who have already claimed the rice and registered: (1) Those who registered on the 3rd (Public Concession) will pay on the 7th and receive the rice on the 8th.

### If There Are Difficulties with Foreign Exchange Settlements in Various Industries, Permission Will Be Granted to Go to Hong Kong for Explanation; No Changes to Foreign Exchange Settlement Procedures for October

A reporter from Dazhong News met with a senior official of the Bank of China yesterday morning and confirmed that the foreign exchange settlement procedures for October are exactly the same as last month, with no changes. The following imported goods are allowed to be settled with foreign exchange: (1) Major imported goods listed in List A, such as rice, tobacco leaves, petroleum products, and coal, will still be provided with foreign exchange according to the quota allocation system. (2) Other important goods listed in List B, such as hemp, cotton, wool, machinery, flour, wheat, sugar, chemical raw materials, paints, oil, newspapers, rubber, tires, and photographic materials, may be provided with foreign exchange after application and approval. (3) Minor imported goods not listed in Lists A and B and the list of prohibited imports may also be settled with foreign exchange, but each transaction is still limited to US$2,000 or £500. (4) Individual remittances, travel expenses, and insurance fees are limited to US$200 or £50 per person per family per month. The Exchange Stabilization Fund has specially approved the operation of foreign exchange banks.

The text of the telegram is as follows: "There are no changes to the foreign exchange settlement procedures promulgated in September. They will continue to be effective this month. If there are difficulties in various industries, the Exchange Stabilization Fund will allow representatives from the industries to go to Hong Kong for explanation." It is now known that representatives from the film and insurance industries have already been dispatched to Hong Kong to meet with members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund to request a sufficient supply of foreign exchange to maintain their development. In addition, representatives from the cotton, tobacco, and automobile industries will soon be ready to go to explain the difficulties of their respective industries. The focus of the foreign exchange problem has now shifted from Shanghai to Hong Kong. It is expected that after the members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund meet with the representatives of various industries, there will be new solutions to various issues.

### Difficult to Decide on a One-Shift Work System, Involving Business Issues

Japanese Business Firms Remain Cold; British Business Firms' Interests Differ Significantly

The "Times" reports that according to Mr. Baker, Secretary of the British Chamber of Commerce, the use of a one-shift work system is difficult to decide because the issue involves a wide range of concerns. The meeting has yet to reach a decision. Other responsible British expatriates say that they can indeed save fuel with a one-shift system, and the benefits are sufficient to compensate for any inconveniences. They are now awaiting the Shanghai Power Company's research results. An employee of the Shanghai Power Company said that if Japanese firms cannot implement it consistently, the hope of saving fuel is slim. Chinese stores have already stated that business is busiest in the afternoon and are therefore unwilling to stop business in the afternoon. As for the Japanese firms, it is reported that their attitude towards the new system is very cold. The opinions of Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and the East Asia Shipping Company can represent the Japanese side. A spokesman for Mitsubishi said that the company is unwilling to consider the plan until the Municipal Council has adopted it. It is questionable whether the company supports it. An employee of Mitsui said that Japanese firms have no intention of considering a one-shift system and does not believe that Japanese firms will support the new system because Japanese firms often communicate with Japanese businesses, and Japan is using the traditional system. Once Shanghai changes the hours, it will greatly harm business. An employee of the East Asia Shipping Company said that if they stop work in the afternoon, they will feel too busy and have no time to rest. Another responsible Japanese said that the Japanese believe that the present time is a time to work hard and be willing to sacrifice. It is expected that the Japanese military authorities will not approve the cessation of office work in the afternoon. Mr. Marshall of the British Chamber of Commerce told reporters that the British Chamber of Commerce discussed the one-shift office system on Thursday evening, but no decision was made. The one-shift system is not entirely beneficial for all business firms. Real estate and import-export firms may adopt this system, but shipping companies and others cannot easily adopt it. His own Xiangxing Foreign Firm is waiting for the decision of the British Chamber of Commerce regarding the change of office hours. If other business firms adopt this system, Xiangxing Foreign Firm will follow suit.

### Price Controls on Cooking Oil by French Authorities Remain in Effect

In order to achieve the objectives of its establishment, the Price Evaluation Committee of the French Concession previously evaluated and set standard selling prices for cooking oil and ordered all parties to comply. These price controls remain in effect. However, some unscrupulous oil merchants, blinded by greed, dare to disobey and deliberately stir up trouble, fabricate rumors, and confuse people, causing the price of soy sauce to repeatedly exceed the limits, which is illegal. Because cooking oil is a necessity, its price fluctuations seriously harm people's livelihoods. Moreover, the source of cooking oil is still pouring in, the inventory is sufficient, and there is no shortage of outlets, so there is no need to worry about future shortages. The frequent increase in market prices is clearly the result of speculation and manipulation by merchants. The relevant authorities stationed in Shanghai have paid close attention to the actions of speculative oil merchants. According to information disclosed by the flour and miscellaneous goods industry, a large amount of Dalian soy oil was offered for sale in the market the other day, and market sentiment was once weak. But because the rumors did not subside, the market situation ultimately did not ease.

### Presbyterian Churches from Various Regions Gather in Shanghai; Japanese Missionaries Cannot Work

Responsible persons from Presbyterian churches across the country have come to Shanghai over the past two weeks to convene a meeting to discuss important issues such as missionary work in mainland China. Those who came to Shanghai to participate in the meeting included Hayes (Beijing), Carpentar (Guangzhou), Yanzhi (Huaiyuan), Stanley (Nanjing), Romig (Qingdao), Imis (Yantai), and Herbert (Shanghai). It is said that in the past few months, the number of Presbyterian missionaries in various places has decreased slightly, but there has not been a large-scale withdrawal. Originally, there were 350 people, and now 300 remain. Most of those who withdrew were women and children.

Fisher, a missionary from the American Baptist Church in Tokyo, recently came to Shanghai from Japan. According to him, American missionaries in Japan have not withdrawn despite repeated exhortations from the U.S. government to return home during this period of deteriorating Far Eastern situation. Some missionaries have recently withdrawn from Japan because the Japanese environment has forced them to take this action in terms of their work. According to his observations, the withdrawal is not due to changes in the international situation. Fisher estimates that there are currently 150 American missionaries in Japan, compared to 500 a year ago. Some missionaries returned to the United States on vacation, but the State Department refused to issue passports, so they could not return to Japan as scheduled. Currently, no churches in Japan are withdrawing missionaries except for the Methodist Episcopal Church. Even among the Methodist Episcopal Church missionaries, some are still stationed in Japan.

### In Memory of Bishop Wei Changlu of Qingdao

— Zhao Erqian

Anyone who has been to Qingdao knows Bishop Wei Changlu (Rt. Rev. George Weig, S.V.D. DD). When the ship is still three or four miles away from the pier, the building that first comes into view is the exquisite and beautiful Catholic Church that towers on the hillside and soars into the clouds. This is the church built by the Bishop of Qingdao. It is not only the crystallization of his life's work, but also the place where he lived, rested, worked, and prayed in recent years.

Wei was born in Germany in 1883. He entered the Society of the Divine Word as a monk and then specialized in theology and philosophy in Vienna, where he gained a great deal of insight. After obtaining a doctorate in theology, he was promoted to priest. He came to China in 1908 to preach in Shandong Province, serving as the Dean of the Major Seminary in Yanzhou Prefecture for twelve years. Most of the Chinese priests who now populate the Shandong Diocese came from Wei's school. He advocated cultivating Chinese clergy so that the Catholic Church in China could be completely managed by the Chinese, which is not only suitable for China's current national conditions and needs, but also of great importance to the future development of the Catholic Church.

Archbishop Gang Henyi, the former Apostolic Delegate to China, believed that Wei had made great contributions to the church and China. He personally consecrated him as the Bishop of Qingdao in Yanzhou Prefecture in 1928. The appointment of Wei as Bishop by the Roman Curia was not only celebrated by the Catholics in Qingdao, but also deeply admired by Chinese public opinion. Since then, Bishop Wei has been permanently stationed in Qingdao, devoting his efforts to the church affairs and education of the entire diocese, striving for development, and increasing the number of Catholics and schools. The statistics are all there and need not be repeated. In recent years, the Sino-Japanese War has occurred, and the number of refugees in Qingdao is extremely large. Bishop Wei provided them with clothing and food to the best of his ability. He was so busy with work that he had no time to warm his seat or enter his home. Yesterday (October 3), a telegram came from Qingdao stating that Bishop Wei had been suffering from illness for many years due to overwork. Medical treatment was ineffective, and he unfortunately passed away on the 3rd. Friends in Shanghai were shocked to hear the news and plan to hold a memorial service in the coming days. On his deathbed, Wei was still praying for the peace of China and the Qingdao Diocese. Therefore, the passing of the Bishop of Qingdao is not only a loss to the Shandong Diocese, but also a loss of a good friend in China.

### Waste Utilization

— Fu Gui

A Special Visit to the Handicraft Relief Project

Thirty-eight years ago, the Methodist Episcopal Church in Boston, USA, initiated an active and unusual relief effort called Goodwill Industries, or "Charity Crafts." We now call it "Handicraft Relief." Its purpose is to provide work opportunities for the elderly, weak, disabled, unemployed, and ordinary people. It focuses on vocational training, self-help, self-sufficiency, and self-reliance. After the refugee relief work in this city ended, the refugees were scattered in areas such as Nanshi, without work, clothes, or food, and the situation was very miserable. Mr. W.D. Boone, an American expatriate, witnessed this and was heartbroken. He adopted the above-mentioned American method, and the American Presbyterian Church and the Shanghai South Qingxin Church, two well-known Christian organizations, took the lead in founding the Puyi Handicraft Cooperative in 1938. At the beginning, it was founded with a small amount of funds of only 963 yuan, one jiao, and one fen, and rescued five or six refugees every day. It has expanded year by year, and last year it spent 96,000 yuan on relief expenses, rescuing more than 1,000 people every day, and benefiting more than 33,000 people directly and indirectly throughout the year. The progress of its work can be described as amazing. The reporter will now report the actual work of the cooperative to the readers based on the interviews.

The Employed of Handicraft Relief

The purpose of the cooperative's work is to improve the production skills of the refugees and improve their living conditions. Therefore, they are called craftsmen instead of refugees. They are not treated as refugees. All those employed by the cooperative, whether they are in training or already able to work, are given food, clothing, and wages. They work seven or eight hours a day, and the hourly wage is 20 to 50 cents, depending on their work ability and family burden. The cooperative has 37 types of vocational training, such as carpentry, painting, bamboo work, sewing, washing and dyeing, etc., and provides training and assigns work according to the gender, age, and physical condition of the craftsmen. The cooperative's employees can be divided into the following categories: (1) those with physical disabilities, (2) ordinary people who are stimulated by the lack of work opportunities, (3) those who are despised by society and unable to find work on their own, and (4) the elderly who lack support. Among them, women are the majority. The cooperative hopes that when the craftsmen become skilled, they will leave the cooperative and make a living by their skills. Therefore, the cooperative has a job placement department. For those who cannot work outside, such as the elderly, weak, and disabled craftsmen, the cooperative helps them to work at home while maintaining a relationship with the cooperative. In this way, other unfortunate people can continue to enter the cooperative for training, benefiting everyone.

Useless Things, Source of Life

The craftsmen's workshop is located in the Puyi Cooperative Building at Dadongmen in Nanshi. The "raw materials" for the handicraft relief are mostly old clothes and waste materials collected from the outside world, which are modified, renewed, washed, dyed, sorted, and painted before being sold. The proceeds from the sale are used entirely to pay the craftsmen's wages. This newspaper has already reported on the method of collecting waste materials. Readers who sympathize with this active relief work are requested to set up a Puyi bag in each household and put any unwanted or worn-out clothes in the bag at any time and notify the cooperative to collect them. What you think is waste is what many people depend on for their livelihood. The craftsmen's slogan is "It is more blessed to give than to receive," "Use waste to create a livelihood for the poor," and "Turn waste into resources for the poor to produce." Due to limited funds, the facilities in the craftsmen's workshop are insufficient. Therefore, we sincerely appeal to the society. Their needs are: materials, such as cloth and yarn; equipment, such as sewing machines, knitting machines, towel machines, and printing machines. We also hope that if there are enthusiastic people who are skilled in handicrafts and are willing to serve as volunteer instructors for the craftsmen, we would be even more grateful.

### 900 Polish Refugees Expected to Leave Shanghai This Year

Nine hundred Polish and Latvian refugees were transported to Shanghai from Kobe, Japan, in the past two months. They are now being supported by the European Relief Association. According to responsible officials, all of the refugees will be transported to Canada, the United States, and Palestine in the near future. They are currently waiting for entry permits and are expected to leave this year. These refugees fled from Poland after the German invasion and traveled a long distance through Siberia from the Soviet Union to Kobe, Japan, where they lived for two years. The Japanese authorities recently ordered them to leave the country or go to Shanghai, so they came to Shanghai. Among them, 450 are well-educated teachers.

### Lead Type and Parts Workers Incite Bear People Arrested

### Vandalizing Typesetting Racks and Beating Store Owners: Trial Adjourned to Wednesday for Further Review

Lead type and parts workers, recently demanding wage increases from employers due to rising prices, initiated a joint strike from the day before yesterday. It is understood that relevant parties are mediating to resolve the issue as soon as possible. However, yesterday, a large group of workers went to Yi Cheng Printing House on Zhifu Road, Nan Guo Printing House on An'nan Road, and Da Zhong, Ming Ming, Dong Fang, Yuan Dong, Xin Sheng, and other factories, causing disturbances. The owner of Liang Yi Printing House on Tiantong Road was also beaten by workers yesterday. However, the labor representatives of the industry strongly urged the workers to remain calm and avoid disturbances.

Lead type and parts workers in this city recently demanded wage increases from employers again due to rising prices and jointly launched a strike as a threat. The day before yesterday, more than a hundred workers broke into Xie Wenyi Printing House on Shandong Road, intending to cause trouble. Workers Lu Fuchang, Sun Xiukun, Qian Pubai, and three others were arrested and sent to the Special First Court for punishment on record. Unexpectedly, at 2:50 PM on the third day, several dozen workers swarmed to Tian Hua Tang Printing House at 286 Ningbo Road, sending Gu Linrui, Zheng Linsong, and Chen Fugen as representatives. Inside, they dismantled the printing press and destroyed the typeset lead plates. Finally, they surrounded and beat the store owner, Ding Jinshan, creating a serious situation. Fortunately, Chinese constables from 2629 and other numbers arrived and arrested Gu Linrui. Just as they were about to take him to the police station, the remaining workers Zheng Linsong, Chen Fugen, Liu Jicai, Yao Yunfa, Zhou Jilin, Zhang Baihe, Wang Yijin, Wang Zixiang, Xu Hexiang, and thirty-one others all voluntarily went with him. The General Police Station separately detained them. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the case, saying that when Gu Linrui was arrested, twenty leaflets were found in his hand. However, considering the situation of the defendants at the time, they engaged in violent and intimidating behavior, and the situation was serious. Demands for wage increases should be pursued through peaceful means and should not exceed the bounds of the law. Currently, this case involves a large number of people, and investigation will take time, so he requested

permission to detain [them].

When questioned, the defendants admitted to going to persuade [others] to strike. According to the case filed by Ding Jinshan, owner of Tian Hua Tang Printing House, Gu Linrui and Zheng Linsong broke into the shop and destroyed lead plates, while Chen Fugen dragged him out and beat him with wooden sticks. Judge Meng adjourned the case to next Wednesday for further hearing, and the defendants were granted detention.

### Bomb Discovered in Front of Sesame Cake Shop Fortunately No Explosion Police Take Away for Investigation Public Believes This is a Warning to Arouse Awareness

Yesterday afternoon around 4:50 PM, two hand grenades were placed in front of the Shanghai Municipal Grains and Sesame Cake Industry Association at 15 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. Fortunately, they did not explode. It was reported that at that time, a middle-aged man, carrying a rectangular package wrapped in old newspaper, walked to the front of the number, pretended to fasten his garter, bent down and left the newspaper package on the ground, and then looked up and left, never looking back, and then disappeared. Passersby noticed and became suspicious, but did not dare to check it. For a moment, a crowd gathered and discussed. The nearby constable, after receiving the news, was very surprised by the paper package and immediately reported it to the French police station, which sent personnel to inspect it. It was determined to be two hand grenades with wooden handles, which were taken back to the police station for strict investigation. It was also learned that a letter was attached inside the package, which was also taken away by the French police station. The public believes that the hand grenades may contain a warning to arouse awareness.

### Changsha Commercial Telegrams Restored

American news agencies and the Great Eastern Telegraph Company have scheduled to receive and send commercial telegrams starting today, and the time is fast, only half a day to arrive. As for Shanghai and Changsha remittances, they have never stopped since the beginning. Now that there are no traces of Japanese soldiers in Changsha and the commercial state has returned to normal, business exchanges are becoming more frequent, so the remittance situation is becoming more busy.

### Portugal National Day

### Talking About the Mid-Autumn Festival

— Zhang Mengzhao

The Mid-Autumn Festival is one of the happiest seasons for children in a year. In terms of clothing, there are single-layered flannel suits (referring to children from wealthy families) and small leather shoes; in terms of food, there are shrimp, crab, fish, meat, lotus seed paste mooncakes, egg yolk mooncakes, ham mooncakes, and Liangxiang chestnuts, white fruits, snow pears, bananas, apples, lotus roots, taro, etc. In terms of entertainment, watching movies, watching Peking opera, etc. ... This Mid-Autumn Festival seems to be unique to the rich. "The moon is exceptionally bright during the Mid-Autumn Festival," it is truly a joyous festival of reunion. However ... what about many poor children? Where do they have a "Mid-Autumn Festival" to celebrate? Their hometown is broken! Their parents took them and fled to isolated islands, worrying about soaring prices every day! Time passes like years! Where is there any "Mid-Autumn Festival"? Children who enjoy happiness, quickly save on mooncakes, entertainment, and other wasteful spending, and help the refugees! Now, I will talk about the historical facts and stories of the Mid-Autumn Festival.

The old lunar August 15th is called the "Mid-Autumn Festival" because it is in the middle of the three months of autumn. In 1920, the National Government changed the Mid-Autumn Festival to the full moon after the autumnal equinox of the solar calendar, the earliest being September 9th and the latest being October 7th. This year it happens to be October 5th, coinciding with the children's Sunday.

In ancient times, Wu Gang, a man from Xihe in the Han Dynasty, committed an offense while learning immortality and was exiled to cut down the "cassia tree in the moon." The cassia tree was 500 feet tall, and when cut, the tree healed as soon as it was damaged. (See Youyang Zazu.) Li Shizhen said: "The story of Wu Gang cutting down the cassia tree originated from novels of the Sui and Tang dynasties." The poet Li Taibai has a line: "Wanting to cut down the cassia tree in the moon, holding it as firewood for the cold." Bai Juyi also wrote in a poem: "The cassia tree in the moon is reclining, its roots relying on the blue sky."

The ancient Greeks regarded laurel as a sacred object. Those with excellent poetic talent or victory in competitions were awarded laurel leaf crowns to show honor. Later, in European universities, this was also given to scholars. Poets selected by the British royal family were called "poet laureates."

### The Story of the Mid-Autumn Festival

— Yingdai

The abandoned calendar eighth day is a month for eating mooncakes. Chinese people in Shanghai and other cities, once a year at Mid-Autumn, have to eat this delicious mooncake. The right day to eat mooncakes is August 15th. In all Chinese festivals, there are delicious things to eat. Chinese people usually think that August 15th is the day to worship the moon god, so-called Mid-Autumn, everyone knows. And there are many stories to tell. Some Chinese people think the moon is a jade rabbit, so in the beginning, mooncakes were printed with a jade rabbit. According to Buddhist legends, this rabbit believed in Buddhism, and he willingly sacrificed his life for the bodhisattva. To reward his loyalty, he was reborn as the old man in the moon, and this old man is responsible for all the responsibilities of the moon god. In mid-August, in ancient times, women who were usually mothers would cut rabbits out of white paper at night and put them in their daughters' shoes. This is believed that their daughters would soon be selected to marry a satisfactory husband.

In Chinese folk songs, there is a picture drawn with a jade rabbit sitting under a cassia tree in the moon, digging for herbs for immortality. Sometimes a young girl is drawn sitting next to the rabbit.

### Types of Mooncakes

— Meng Bai

Mooncakes were obviously an object for worshiping the moon in ancient times, and now they have become something for humans to eat. Speaking of the origin of mooncakes, there is also a story related to Chinese history. It is said that Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty, initially joined the Mongolian army and decided to revolt and overthrow the Yuan Dynasty. In order to facilitate the transmission of secret orders, he made a cake shaped like the moon and put the secret orders inside the cake. This cake was distributed to the subordinates on the Mid-Autumn Festival, so the Mongols would not be suspicious at all. Although the plan failed, the mooncake became popular. Every Mid-Autumn Festival, there is a custom of eating mooncakes. If this story is true, then the creation of mooncakes was as early as the Yuan Dynasty, more than 500 years ago. The popularity of mooncakes is to buy them and send them to the chairman, made by Guanshengyuan. Such a mooncake is probably worth thousands of yuan now.

### The King and the Wooden Stick

— Zi Ren

Many years ago, there was a king who, because he liked to roam around, made himself thin and sickly. So, he hired a famous doctor to treat him. The clever doctor, after careful observation, knew that it could not be cured by medicine, but it needed the help of exercise.

Therefore, the doctor brought two heavy sticks made of wood and handed them to the king, and said to him that these two things were the medicine to cure his disease.

The doctor told the king that he must hold the handles of these two wooden sticks tightly and then shake them gradually, swinging them indefinitely until his hands sweat, and then let them stop. Its function is to expel the moisture inside the body. The king obeyed the doctor's words and did this wooden stick exercise every day at a fixed time.

After the king had this exercise, his strength gradually increased and his health improved day by day. Therefore, he greatly praised the effectiveness of the wooden sticks and the doctor's cleverness. After that, he no longer consulted the doctor. But there was nothing in the wooden sticks. It was just made of wood. Finally, he realized that the strange treatment was not the wood stick itself, but the result of his own constant efforts to exercise.

### Moon Viewing

— Cao Binjie

The secret beauty is called Chang'e, who stole the elixir of immortality and fled to the moon, so she became immortal. This story has been adapted into a drama and performed on stage, and this fleeing woman is represented by a dance. In recent years, the production methods have also been improved day by day. Especially in Shanghai, the fierce competition among mooncake merchants can be fully seen, but the manufacturing is constantly improved, and the shape of the mooncake is always round because it represents the moon.

In Shanghai, there are three different types of mooncakes. That is Cantonese style, Suzhou style, and Ningbo style (Nanjing style). Suzhou and Ningbo styles are made the same way, but Ningbo style is generally larger and has more filling than Suzhou style. As for Suzhou style, the filling is more exquisite than excessive. These two types of mooncakes have yellow and charred surfaces, printed with various names, and the most popular is Cantonese style mooncakes, which are harder and baked yellower. It is larger than the Suzhou and Ningbo styles, and looks like foreign biscuits. Regarding the filling, Cantonese style mooncakes also vary, in addition to ham, bean paste, coconut paste, sweet velvet meat, and even lotus seeds, diced chicken and duck eggs, and so on. Usually, the price of Cantonese style mooncakes is also greater than Suzhou and Ningbo styles, and it is not uncommon for one to cost hundreds of yuan. They are also commonly used as gifts, usually around one or two yuan each. The specially made ones are as big as a table, with a whole chicken, a ham, and about a dozen duck eggs inside. It is said that before the war, the largest mooncake made in Shanghai was worth 500 yuan, which was to the subordinates of Jiang Wei.

### The Moon on Mid-Autumn Night

— Lin Ren

The annual abandoned calendar Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived again today, and many people can be seen on the streets sending festive gifts. With such soaring prices now, why can't we save on this kind of meaningless consumption? There is no festive atmosphere at all in Aliang's home. Aliang's mother only bought a small box of mooncakes, ready to share them with the whole family when watching the moon on the drying terrace tonight, each person can eat one, which is just a decoration.

"Mom, the moon must be round tonight. I heard that there is a Chang'e living in the moon palace, is it true?" Aliang heard that he could only eat mooncakes when watching the moon. He raised this question on the two words of watching the moon.

"Aliang, this is an unfounded myth. In fact, there will be no Chang'e in the moon. You should know that the dark shadows in the moon are not Chang'e, just like our earth, there are rocks, mountains, and plains, etc. When we look at these things from our earth, we see the dark shadows in the moon and mistakenly think they are something else. You should know that it is very cold in the moon. If someone could go there, they would definitely freeze into an icy body. Why is it so cold in the moon? Because there is no air around the moon, and if there is no air, a certain temperature cannot be maintained. Although the moon can also be exposed to the sun, when the sun shines on the stones in the moon, it is exposed to the sun's intense light, and the temperature rises very high, but when the sun does not shine, the temperature drops immediately due to the lack of air. At that time, the heat of the sun's light cannot be maintained firmly, so the temperature of the dark part of the moon is as low as five degrees below zero. Do you think this is terrible? Can we live in such a low temperature? Therefore, not to mention some plants and animals, you can't even find a drop of water in the moon, because this kind of low temperature is really terrible." Aliang's childish question was heard by his father, so he said so much to correct his wrong thinking.

"Dad, then why must the moon on Mid-Autumn Night be round and very bright?" Aliang turned his head and asked the question that he did not quite understand.

"The Mid-Autumn Festival is the fifteenth day of the abandoned calendar August. Every month on the fifteenth, the moon will be round. What is the reason? The moon is sometimes round and sometimes missing because it is changed by the different area exposed to sunlight. The moon will not emit light "its brightness" is completely reflecting the light of the sun, but the place that the sun can reach is only one side, and the other side will not be bright. When we see the moon is round every half month, it is because the side we see is completely exposed to sunlight. The moon is constantly rotating around our earth. When it turns to a place, only half of the side facing us is exposed to sunlight, and the rest is only a little confused and unclear dark shadow. Once every month, the whole moon can be seen, and it feels particularly bright." Aliang's father finished speaking, and it was time to eat dinner.

Tonight, there are more people on the drying terrace watching the moon. Aliang is sitting next to his father, ready to greatly appreciate the Mid-Autumn moon; moreover, he also has mooncakes to eat, it's really good luck.

### Since Entering the "Heavenly Palace"

— Tang Huaiqiu

Since "Zhonglv" was forced to withdraw from "Xuangong" at the end of February last year, it has been five months since it sought a regular performance venue. The lives of dozens of members of the troupe had to be maintained, and these dozens of young comrades have always stayed together and not left. I could not give them even the minimum spiritual comfort, and I could not give a promising fact to prove it. The pain in my heart is really beyond words to describe. At this time, I met Mr. Wu from Shandong Province. Wu is young and promising and has a great interest in drama. He is also sincere and straightforward. Hearing that "Tiangong" was feasible, he was willing to cooperate. Later, with the help of many friends in various aspects, the small bureau of "Tiangong" was built.

On August 16, "Tiangong" opened. "Zhonglv" presented "Grapes and Wine" as its first performance. It was praised by all walks of life, and many people came to watch it. The play was performed continuously for 30 days, followed by the comedy "Under the Pomegranate Skirt". Recently, it has been actively rehearsing "Thousands of Miles of Yellow Sand, Heart of a Beauty". This play is written by Mr. Lantian, a young playwright who is just eighteen years old. It is a great tragedy with Mongolia as the background. The consciousness is correct and the meaning is profound. When I read the play, I was greatly surprised. My friend is Lantian's older brother, so I know for sure that Lantian is eighteen years old. A young man of eighteen can make such a great structure, which is why I am surprised.

The play "Thousands of Miles of Yellow Sand, Heart of a Beauty" is directed by Mr. Wu Jingping. Mr. Wu has studied art for many years and has a history of more than eight years in "Zhonglv". This play is his directorial debut. Mr. Wu worked very hard this time, carefully studying, day and night, without rest. In order to carefully stage this play, all new Mongolian costumes were made, costing a lot of money. They have been working overtime to rush the production, and it has been opened on the evening of October 3.

Huaiqiu has led the China Travel Troupe to perform in various parts of the country for more than nine years. It has been relying on the enthusiastic promotion of people in all walks of life and the encouragement and assistance of friends to exist today. It has been nearly two months since entering the "Heavenly Palace". I wrote this article to give a brief report to people who care about "Zhonglv" and friends who care about Huaiqiu.

### In Memory of Physician Shen Shiyi

— Wan Qian

—A Patriot Who Sacrificed Himself for the Country—

Physician Shen, styled Shiyi, courtesy name Gongchi, was a native of Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province. He graduated from Zhejiang Medical College and served as a physician at Renji Hospital and the Two-Roads Bureau. After the war, he served in the rear, traveling back and forth between northern Hubei and western Hunan for two years, enduring hardship without complaint. Recently, when the Japanese army attacked Changsha and the battle was fierce, he rushed to Xiangyin to preside over a hospital for wounded soldiers. Unfortunately, he succumbed to illness from overwork and died on September 25th at Chen time (around 8 am). He was 37 years old and left behind a wife and one child each.

These past few days, just as the whole nation was enthusiastically celebrating the great victory at Changsha, I suddenly received the tragic news that my former colleague, Mr. Shen Shiyi, had dedicated his precious life to the motherland in this battle.

Since the outbreak of this war, many martyrs have sacrificed themselves, and I certainly cannot single him out and praise him excessively. However, because Physician Shen's death stirred two deep emotions within me, I cannot help but say a few words:

First: The Chinese people who remain in Shanghai are too comfortable and too frivolous. Physician Shen was also a clever man, certainly not a fool. He could have remained in Shanghai and lived a comfortable life; yet he resolutely went to the rear, working in an area very close to the front lines, enduring hardship and suffering, which ultimately led to his death! He is certainly worthy of our admiration, while we who continue to live here feel increasingly ashamed.

Second: After the war, Shanghai's market became abnormally prosperous. Many great physicians have become wealthy, riding in cars, building Western-style houses, and being as arrogant as tropical fish kept in the houses of wealthy families. When asking them to see a doctor, they put on a "eating uncooked rice" face, as if they were incredibly important. The rear area desperately needs medical talent, but who is willing to go? They mistakenly believe themselves to be very noble, but compared to Physician Shen, they are simply cowardly and worthless!

I originally did not want to scold people, but feeling saddened by the death of a friend, I cannot help but vent a little. I hope everyone will encourage each other!

(Editor's Note) Physician Shen was a famous amateur opera singer. Before going to the rear, he often contributed articles to this publication. His writing was clear and beautiful, and his theories were thorough. He was truly a rare and valuable commentator on Peking opera. Now that he has sacrificed himself for the country, we respectfully extend our highest respect on behalf of this publication!

### Blood Rain and Jade Flowers

— Gu Mingdao

Chapter 17: In a Fit of Rage, for the Sake of a Beautiful Woman

Wu Xiang's letter was very long and sincere, filled with persuasive sentiments. San Gui read it again and again, especially the last few sentences about the family's lives being insecure and the father and son never being able to see each other again, which made his heart pound even faster. After thinking for a long time, he decided to follow his father's advice, surrender to Li Chuang, betray the Ming Dynasty, preserve his family's wealth and status, and become a meritorious official of the new dynasty. He then summoned Ma Bao to his tent to discuss important matters, and showed Ma Bao Wu Xiang's letter. Because Ma Bao was the most trusted lieutenant in his army, he always consulted with him on everything. Ma Bao saw that San Gui's intention was already moving, so he said that the rumors of the Ming Dynasty's decline and the "eighteen sons" prophecy had already spread throughout the provinces. Judging from the current situation, Li Mu's strength was on the rise, and in the future, he would unify the world like the Ming Taizu. It would be better to surrender to Li Chuang, and in the future, riches and honor would be boundless. Wu San Gui heard Ma Bao say this as well, so he prepared to announce his intentions to the army the next day, those who were willing to follow would stay, those who were unwilling could leave. He would go to Beijing to receive Li Chuang's title and be reunited with Yuan Yuan. Unexpectedly, on this very day at dusk, the first scout he had sent out had returned from Beijing. Upon seeing Wu San Gui, he was about to report. San Gui immediately asked, "Is my family safe?" The scout replied, "They have been confiscated by Li Chuang." San Gui smiled and said, "As long as I get to Beijing, I'll make sure he returns everything." So he had no worries, except for thinking about Yuan Yuan alone. At the second watch (around 10 pm), another scout returned with a report, saying that the old general Wu Xiang had surrendered to Li Chuang, but was being held captive by Li Chuang, who wanted the old general to write a letter to persuade the commander to surrender.
